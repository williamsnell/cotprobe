Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Holocene African cultures. I'm a bit rusty on my bio, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking which two cultures were replaced by each other in the Holocene. The options are A to J, each pairing two different cultures. I remember that the Iberomaurusian culture was around the time, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact replacements.

Wait, I think the Iberomaurusian replaced something. Oh right, the Iberomaurusian replaced the Maglemosian culture. The Maglemosian is from the Near East, I believe, and they were involved in stone carvings and some stone tools. The Iberomaurusian, which is the Old World, probably replaced the Maglemosian with something else. Which one? Oh, capsaicin stones. So the Iberomaurusian replaced Maglemosian with Capsian culture. Capsian is another ancient culture.

Looking at the options, option C says Iberomaurusian replaced Capsian. So C is Iberomaurusian culture; Capsian culture. That makes sense. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option D is Natufian; Iberomaurusian. I don't think Natufian replaced Iberomaurusian, but maybe another way. Natufian was part of the Old World, but I don't recall them being replaced by Iberomaurusian. Option E is Capsian; microlith blade. I don't think that's right. Microliths are stone carvings, which were replaced by stone tools by Iberomaurusian.

Option A is Iberomaurusian replaced by Maglemosian. No, that's the opposite. I think Maglemosian replaced Iberomaurusian, but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, no, I think the Iberomaurusian replaced Maglemosian. So A would be Iberomaurusian replaced by Maglemosian, which isn't right.

Option B is Backed blade; microlith blade. That sounds more like different stone tools rather than cultures. The question is about cultures being replaced, not tools.

Option F: Microlith; backed blade. Again, different tools, not cultures.

Option G: Maglemosian replaced Natufian. No, Natufian is part of the Old World, and Maglemosian was Middle Eastern.

Option H: Maglemosian replaced Natufian. No, I don't think so.

Option I: Natufian replaced Capsian. No, I don't think Natufian was the one to be replaced by Capsian.

Option J: Capsian replaced Iberomaurusian? No, the Iberomaurusian replaced Capsian.

So the correct answer must be C: Iberomaurusian replaced Capsian culture.

The Iberomaurusian culture was replaced by the Capsian culture in the Holocene. Capsian is known for their use of stone carvings and stone tools, while the Iberomaurusian replaced them. 

Answer: C
