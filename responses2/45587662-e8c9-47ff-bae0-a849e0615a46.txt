Okay, so I've got this biology question here about natural selection and the smallest unit it can change. Hmm, let's see. I remember that natural selection is about how traits get passed on and changed in a population over time. So, it's all about the variation within a population.

The question is asking which of these options is the smallest unit that natural selection can change. The options include various units like phenotype, genotype, gene frequency, etc. I think I need to remember what each term refers to.

Phenotype is the observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism. So, it's the actual trait you can see, like eye color or height. Genotype is the genetic makeup, like the specific alleles an organism has.

Natural selection acts on phenotypes, right? But wait, the question is about the smallest unit it can change. So, maybe the change is at the level of the individual or the population.

Wait, natural selection doesn't directly change the genotype of the individual. It's about survival and reproduction based on phenotypes. So, for example, if a flower's color changes, natural selection might lead to more flowers with that color surviving, which affects the population's gene frequencies.

So, the individual's genotype would change if there are changes in their genes, but natural selection's effect is on the phenotype. So, the individual's own genotype might not change a lot because what matters is the phenotype.

But wait, the question is about the smallest unit. So, if you look at the options, the individual's phenotype is the observable trait. So, the natural selection can change the phenotype, but it's the phenotypes of the individuals that are being selected for or against.

So, the smallest unit would be the phenotype. But let me think again. The options are asking which is the smallest unit that natural selection can change. So, the individual's phenotype is the unit that gets changed. But wait, wait. No, I think it's the individual's phenotype that can change because if a trait is present in the population, it can be selected for or against.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Natural selection affects the fitness of individuals based on their phenotypes. So, the unit of change is the phenotype. But the question is about the smallest unit. So, for example, if a gene is present in the population, and that leads to a particular phenotype, then natural selection could change that particular phenotype in the population.

Wait, but the question is about the smallest unit. So, perhaps the individual's phenotype can change because the individual's own genotype determines their phenotype. But does natural selection change the genotype of an individual? No, natural selection is about the survival of phenotypes. So, the genotype doesn't change unless there's some mutation or genetic drift, which is not the case in natural selection's main mechanism.

So, natural selection would change the phenotype of the individuals. So, the smallest unit would be the phenotype because it's the trait that's being subject to selection.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A through J, and the question is which is the smallest unit that natural selection can change. So, the smallest unit would be the individual's phenotype because any change in the phenotype would be the unit that selection acts upon. Or perhaps the individual's genotype since that's the genetic basis of the phenotype.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Natural selection acts on the phenotypes. So, for example, if a certain trait is beneficial, and many organisms have it, that trait is selected for. So, the phenotype is what's being selected for. So, the smallest unit would be the phenotype's change.

But wait, the options are about the units. The question is which unit is the smallest that can be changed by selection. So, the individual's phenotype is the trait that's being changed, but the unit that can be changed is the phenotype.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I should think about whether it's the individual's phenotype (A) or the individual's genotype (H). But I think natural selection doesn't change the genotype of an individual. It changes their phenotype, but the genotype remains the same unless there's mutation or genetic drift, which is not part of natural selection.

So, the individual's genotype (H) might not change, but the phenotype (A) can. So, the smallest unit that natural selection can change is the individual's phenotype (A). But wait, the question is about the smallest unit. So, for example, if a population has many possible genotypes, the unit of change might be the individual's genotype, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider the level of change. The individual's phenotype is a unit of change, but the individual's genotype is the genetic basis for that phenotype. So, natural selection doesn't change the genotype, but it changes the phenotype. So, the phenotypic level is more directly affected by selection.

So, the smallest unit that natural selection can change is the individual's phenotype (A). Wait, but looking at the options, the question is which is the smallest unit. So, the individual's phenotype (A) is the unit that gets changed, so that's the smallest unit in terms of variation within the population.

Alternatively, perhaps the individual's genotype isn't the smallest unit. The individual's genotype is a specific genetic makeup, but natural selection affects the phenotype, which is the observable trait. So, the smallest unit would be the phenotype.

Wait, but the question says "the smallest unit that natural selection can change." So, if natural selection can change the phenotype (A) of individuals, then the individual's phenotype is the smallest unit that it can change. Because the individual's genotype is the underlying cause, but the phenotype is what's selected for.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about it another way. Natural selection acts on the genetic variation (genotypes) within a population. So, the variation is in the genotypes, which leads to the variation in the phenotypes.

Natural selection doesn't change the genotype of the individuals, only the phenotypes. So, the variation that could be selected for is the individual's phenotype. Therefore, the smallest unit of change is the phenotype.

Wait, but the options don't include a unit that's the phenotype. The options are A: phenotype, etc. So, the question is which is the smallest unit. So, the individual's phenotype (A) is the smallest unit that can be changed. Because the individual's genotype is the underlying genetic basis for their phenotype, but selection doesn't change the genotype; it changes the phenotype.

So, the correct answer should be A: an individual's phenotype. But wait, looking at the options again, option A is an individual's phenotype. So, the question is which unit is the smallest. So, the individual's phenotype is the smallest unit that can be changed by natural selection because it's the trait being selected on.

Alternatively, maybe the individual's genotype is the unit that's being changed. But no, natural selection doesn't change the genotype of an individual. It only changes the phenotype. So, the change is in the phenotype, which is the individual's trait.

So, the correct answer should be A: an individual's phenotype.

Natural selection acts on the phenotypes of individuals in a population, determining which traits are advantageous or disadvantageous. The question asks for the smallest unit that natural selection can change. 

The options are analyzed as follows:

- **Phenotype (A):** The observable trait of an individual, which is directly subject to selection. This is the smallest unit because natural selection changes the phenotypes of individuals.
- **Genotype (H):** The genetic makeup of an individual, which determines their phenotype. While genetic variation is the source of variation, natural selection does not change the genotype of an individual.
- **Other options (B to J):** These refer to units like the individual's genotype, gene frequency, population's phenotype, or gene frequency. None of these are the smallest unit that natural selection can change.

Natural selection changes the phenotypes of individuals, making the individual's phenotype the smallest unit that it can change.
