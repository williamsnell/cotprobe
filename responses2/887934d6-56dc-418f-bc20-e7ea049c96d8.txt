Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"When the gods fashioned Gilgamesh*, to him they gave a perfect form. The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.
Of Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stoneâ€”it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk."
The Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the origins of epic poetry like the Epic of Gilgamesh. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question gives a passage about Gilgamesh, a king of Uruk and epic poetry. The passage talks about the construction of Uruk, its wall, and the sacred temple of Ishtar. It mentions how the gods shaped him and the division of the city into parts: city, garden, field, and temple.

Now, the question is asking which of the options best describes the origins of epic poetry. The options are A to J, each describing different historical events.

Let me go through each option one by one to see which fits best.

Option A: The rise of a merchant class in cities who could sponsor the creation of original art. Hmm, the passage doesn't mention anything about merchants or sponsorship. It's more about the gods shaping him and the structure of Uruk.

Option B: The rise of a priestly class who were believed to have the power to communicate with the gods. The passage doesn't state anything about priests or divine influence. It's more about the divine creation of Gilgamesh and the structure of Uruk.

Option C: The rise of a religious caste dedicated solely to recording the deeds of God-Kings. The passage talks about how the gods shaped him and how Uruk is divided into city, garden, field, and temple. It doesn't mention any caste system or recording efforts, though I think the Epic of Gilgamesh does have a section about the sacred wall and the temple, implying that writing or poetry was involved. But I'm not sure if it's about a caste dedicated to recording.

Option D: The rise of a democratic society where the people chose what stories were worthy. The passage doesn't mention any political developments. The epic is a literary work, not a political document.

Option E: The rise of an explorers class who documented their journeys. The passage is about a city's construction, not explorers. It doesn't relate to poetry or explorers.

Option F: A noble class commissioned poems. The passage says that the gods shaped him, and the city is divided into parts. I'm not sure how this relates to the origins of epic poetry. Maybe the noble class wrote about their heritage, but that's not the origin.

Option G: A literate class of scribes who could record. The passage mentions that the gods shaped him and the city is divided into parts. The epic does have a section about the temple and the wall, which might imply that the scribes wrote about it. So this could be a possible answer.

Option H: An agricultural society with poets. The passage doesn't mention any agricultural aspects. It's about a city and a temple.

Option I: A warrior elite praised for their deeds. Doesn't fit; epic poetry is more about art, not combat.

Option J: A scholarly class translating oral stories. The passage doesn't mention scholarly classes or translating. It's about the divine creation and city structure.

Wait, the Epic of Gilgamesh does involve writing and poetry. The passage says that the gods shaped him and that the city is divided into parts, which might suggest that writing was part of its creation. So, the origin of epic poetry would involve a literate class (G) who wrote it.

So the correct answer should be G: The rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems.

The origins of epic poetry like the Epic of Gilgamesh involve a literate class of scribes in cities who could write and record. This class likely included those who composed and documented the city's structure, the divine creation of Gilgamesh, and the sacred wall of Uruk. 

Answer: G
