Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve: Simplify −4 + 7 • 3². Hmm, let's break it down. I remember that in math problems, I need to follow the order of operations, which is often remembered by PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. 

First, looking at the expression, I see a multiplication symbol between 7 and 3 squared. So I should handle that part first. 

The exponent part is 3 squared. I know that 3 squared means 3 multiplied by itself, so 3 * 3. Let me calculate that: 3 * 3 is 9. So 3² equals 9.

Now, the expression becomes −4 + 7 * 9. Next step is to handle the multiplication. 7 times 9. Let me think, 7*9 is 63. So now the expression is −4 + 63.

Now, I need to perform the addition. −4 plus 63. Hmm, subtracting 4 from 63. Wait, no, it's −4 + 63, which is the same as 63 minus 4. Let me calculate that: 63 - 4 is 59. So the result should be 59.

Let me double-check my steps. Exponents first: 3² is 9. Then multiplication: 7 * 9 is 63. Then addition: −4 + 63 is 59. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options provided, let's see which one is 59. Option G is 59. So the correct answer should be G.

The problem requires simplifying −4 + 7 • 3². Following the order of operations (PEMDAS), we first calculate the exponent: 3² = 9. Then, we perform the multiplication: 7 * 9 = 63. Finally, we add −4 to 63, resulting in 59. The correct answer is G: 59.

Answer: G
