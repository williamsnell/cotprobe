Okay, so I've got this question about Mr. Totten's insurance policies, and I need to figure out the refund he got after canceling the policies. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the question says that on January 3, he insuranceed his store against fire loss for $350,000 at $0.95 per $100. Then, he also insured the contents for $500,000 at $0.86 per $100. So, he's got two separate policies here. Then, on July 6, he canceled both policies. The question is, what was his refund?

Hmm, I think I remember that when you cancel an insurance policy, you get a refund based on the amount you paid under the policy. The refund is usually calculated by multiplying the insurance amount by the rate per $100 and then dividing by 100. Because the rate is per $100, so for example, if you paid $350,000, you'd divide that by 100 to get 3500 units, each costing $0.95.

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. So for the fire policy, the total cost was $350,000. The rate is $0.95 per $100, so the refund is 350,000 / 100 * 0.95. Let me calculate that. 350,000 divided by 100 is 3500. Multiply by 0.95: 3500 * 0.95. Let me do that calculation: 3500 * 0.95 is 3325. So the refund for the fire policy is $3325.

Then, the contents policy was $500,000 at $0.86 per $100. So same thing: 500,000 divided by 100 is 5000. Multiply by 0.86: 5000 * 0.86. Let me calculate that: 5000 * 0.86 = 4300. So the refund for the contents is $4300.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says he canceled the policy on July 6. I'm wondering if he got any other charges or if there was an exclusion or something. The question doesn't mention any exclusions or additional fees, so I think the standard refund applies.

So his total refund is the sum of the two. $3325 plus $4300 equals $7625. Let me add that up: 3325 plus 4300. 3325 + 4300 is 7625 exactly. So the total refund is $7625.

Looking at the options: option D is $7,625. So that's the answer.

The refund for Mr. Totten's insurance policies is calculated by summing the refunds from both policies. For the fire policy: $350,000 / 100 = 3500 units, each at $0.95, totaling $3325. For the contents: $500,000 / 100 = 5000 units, each at $0.86, totaling $4300. Adding them together: $3325 + $4300 = $7625. The correct option is D: $7,625.00.

Answer: D
