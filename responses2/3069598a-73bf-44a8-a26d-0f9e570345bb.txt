Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. It says 18.5 dol over m gal equals 3.60 dol over 7.5 gal. Hmm, I think that's a unit conversion problem. Oh wait, "dol" is probably dollars, but I'm not sure if that matters here. The question is asking for m, right?

So, the equation is 18.5 dollars per m gallons equals 3.60 dollars per 7.5 gallons. Wait, that seems a bit off because both are dollars per something, but I'm not sure if they're the same units. Let me parse it again.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as (18.5 dol) / (m gal) = (3.60 dol) / (7.5 gal). So, the units are dollars per volume. I think that makes sense. So, this is a proportion problem where I need to solve for m.

So, to solve for m, I can cross-multiply. Let's write it out:

18.5 / m = 3.60 / 7.5

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the equation is (18.5 / m) = (3.60 / 7.5), because both are dollars per volume. But wait, that can't be right because if you have dollars per m gallons equal to dollars per 7.5 gallons, then m would be 18.5 * (7.5 /3.60). Because if 3.60 is to 7.5 as 18.5 is to m, then it's a proportion.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to set up the equation as:

18.5 / m = 3.60 / 7.5

So, to solve for m, cross-multiply.

Thus, 18.5 * 7.5 = 3.60 * m

So, 18.5 *7.5 = ? Let's calculate that.

18 *7 is 126. 18*.5 is 9, so 18.5*7 is 129.75. 18.5 *0.5 is 9.25. So, 129.75 +9.25 =139. So, 18.5 *7.5 is 139.125.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that multiplication. Alternatively, 18.5 *7.5: 18.5 *7.5 is same as (18 + 0.5) * (7 +0.5) = 18*7 +18*0.5 +0.5*7 +0.5*0.5.

So, 18*7 =126, 18*0.5=9, 0.5*7=3.5, 0.5*0.5=0.25.

Adding them up: 126 +9=135; 135+3.5=138.5; 138.5 +0.25=138.75. Oh wait, so 18.5 *7.5 =138.75.

Wait, but earlier I thought 18.5 *7.5 is 139.125. That's wrong. Let me correct that. So, 18.5 * 7.5 = 138.75.

So, moving on, 138.75 = 3.60 * m.

So, m = 138.75 / 3.60.

Now, let's compute 138.75 divided by 3.60.

Hmm, let's see. 3.60 goes into 138.75 how many times?

First, maybe I can simplify the division. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate decimals: 1387.5 /36.

Now, let's compute 1387.5 ÷ 36.

Alternatively, let me do this step by step.

36 goes into 138 how many times? 36*3=108, 36*4=144. So 3 times. 3*36=108. Subtract from 138: 138-108=30. Bring down the 7, making 307.

36 into 307: 36*8=288. 36*8=288. 307-288=19. Bring down the 5, making 195.

36 into 195: 36*5=180. So 5 times. 195-180=15.

Bring down a 0 (since we're adding decimal places). So, 150.

36 into 150: 4*36=144. So 4 times. 150-144=6. Bring down another 0, making 60.

36 into 60: once. 36*1=36. 60-36=24. Bring down a 0, making 240.

36 into 240: 6*36=216. 240-216=24. Hmm, this is starting to repeat.

So, compiling the numbers:

36 into 138.75 is 3.85416666... So, m is approximately 38.541666... dollars per gallon? Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, what units are we dealing with here?

Wait, no. Wait, the original equation is 18.5 dollars per m gallons equals 3.60 dollars per 7.5 gallons. So, the units are (dollars per m gallons) = (dollars per 7.5 gallons). So, when we set up the equation, it's:

18.5 / m = 3.60 /7.5 → 18.5/dollars = m/dollars? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me re-express the original equation properly.

The problem says 18.5 dol over m gal equals 3.60 dol over 7.5 gal.

So, 18.5 / m = 3.60 / 7.5 → 18.5 / m = 3.60 /7.5.

Ah, that's correct. So, cross-multiplying gives 18.5 *7.5 = 3.60 * m.

So, 18.5 *7.5 = 138.75.

Therefore, m = 138.75 / 3.60 = ?

Now, let's compute 138.75 ÷ 3.60.

Let me do this step by step.

First, 3.60 * 38 = ?

3.60 *30=108, 3.60*8=28.8 → 108+28.8=136.8.

So, 3.60 *38=136.8. Now, 138.75 –136.8=1.95.

So, 1.95 left. So, how much more do we need? Since 3.60 * x =1.95, x=1.95/3.60= 0.541666...

So, 38 + 0.541666...=38.541666...

So, m≈38.54.

Wait, but the options given are A:45.67, B:28.14, C:36.99, D:32.54, E:8.86, F:38.44, G:40.88, H:33.21, I:42.25, J:50.32.

So, 38.54 is closest to option F:38.44 or G:40.88. Wait, 38.54 is 38.54, which is closer to 38.44 than to 38.54. Wait, but 38.54 is between 38.44 and 38.54, but 38.54 is exactly the result. So, the options don't have 38.54. The closest is F:38.44, which is 0.1 away, but G is 40.88, which is 2.34 away. So, F is the closest.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, let me compute 138.75 divided by 3.60 more accurately.

3.60 into 138.75.

3.60 * 38 = 136.8 → Subtract from 138.75: 138.75 –136.8 =1.95.

Now, 1.95 ÷3.60 = 0.541666...

So, 38.541666... So, m≈38.54.

But looking at the options, option F is 38.44, which is 0.1 away. Option G is 40.88, which is 2.34 away. So, option F is closer.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me go back.

Wait, the original problem states 18.5 dol over m gal equals 3.60 dol over 7.5 gal. So, 18.5 /m =3.60 /7.5.

So, cross-multiplying:18.5 *7.5 =3.60 *m.

We calculated 18.5 *7.5 =138.75.

So, 138.75 =3.60 m → m=138.75 /3.60.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.60 * 38 = 136.8 → 138.75 –136.8 =1.95.

1.95 ÷3.60 = 0.541666...

So, m=38.541666..., which is approximately 38.54.

But the options don't have 38.54. So, the closest is F:38.44.

Wait, but why is the option F 38.44? Let me check if I did the division correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-multiplication. Let me try another approach.

Let me compute 18.5 / m =3.60 /7.5.

Let me write this as (18.5/3.60) = (m/7.5).

Wait, no, that would be 18.5/3.60 = m/7.5, which would be m= (18.5 *7.5)/3.60.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-arrange the equation.

The original equation is 18.5/m =3.60/7.5 → m = (18.5 *7.5)/3.60.

Which is the same as m= (18.5 *7.5)/3.60.

Which is 18.5 *7.5 is 138.75, as before, divided by 3.60 is 38.541666...

So, same result.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: We can write the equation as (18.5)/(m) = (3.60)/(7.5).

Then, solving for m: m = (18.5 *7.5)/3.60.

Yes, same as before.

So, 18.5 *7.5 =138.75; 138.75 ÷3.60 =38.541666...

So, m≈38.54.

Looking at the options, F is 38.44, which is 0.1 away; G is 40.88, which is 2.34 away. So, F is the closest. But wait, perhaps the question expects rounding to the nearest hundredth, but the options are in whole numbers. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:45.67

B:28.14

C:36.99

D:32.54

E:8.86

F:38.44

G:40.88

H:33.21

I:42.25

J:50.32

So, 38.54 is not an option here. The closest one is F:38.44, which is 0.10 away, and G is 40.88, which is 2.34 away. So, the correct option would be F, but wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question was 18.5 over m equals 3.60 over 7.5, but perhaps the question is about dollars per gallon, not per m gallons. Oh! Wait, maybe I've misread the question. Let me read it again.

The problem says 18.5 dol over m gal equals 3.60 dol over 7.5 gal.

Wait, no, that's the same as before. So, m is the number of gallons per dollar, perhaps. Wait, no, wait, the equation is 18.5 dollars per m gallons equals 3.60 dollars per 7.5 gallons.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for m gallons per dollar? Or is it m dollars per gallon? Wait no, the way it's written is 18.5 dol over m gal = 3.60 dol over 7.5 gal.

So, it's 18.5 dollars per m gallons equals 3.60 dollars per 7.5 gallons.

So, 18.5/dollars = m/dollars.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as 18.5 dollars per m gallons equals 3.60 dollars per 7.5 gallons. So, the rate is 18.5 dollars per m gallons equals 3.60 dollars per 7.5 gallons.

So, 18.5 / m = 3.60 / 7.5 → 18.5 *7.5 = 3.60 *m → m = (18.5 *7.5)/3.60 = 138.75/3.60 ≈38.54.

So, the correct answer is approximately 38.54, which is closest to F:38.44.

Wait, but why is the option F:38.44? Let me compute 38.54 to see the nearest option. The options after 38.44 is 38.54, which is 0.1 away from 38.44. So, 38.54 is 0.10 away from F:38.44, and 2.34 away from G:40.88. So F is the right choice.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the division again.

Wait, 3.60 multiplied by 38 is 136.8. 138.75 minus 136.8 is 1.95. 1.95 divided by 3.60 is 0.541666..., which is approximately 0.541667.

So, 38.541666... So m≈38.54.

Looking at the options, 38.44 is option F, which is 0.10 away. 38.54 is not an option, but perhaps the correct answer is F, as that's the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation as (dollars per m gallons) = (dollars per 7.5 gallons). So, 18.5/dollars = m/dollars? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of unit conversion, like m is in gallons per dollar.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as (dollars/m gal) = (dollars/7.5 gal). Let me re-express this.

Let me write it as (dollars/m gal) = (dollars/7.5 gal).

So, dollars per m gallons equals dollars per 7.5 gallons.

So, 18.5/dollars = m/dollars? That can't be right. Alternatively, the rate is dollars per m gallons equals dollars per 7.5 gallons.

So, 18.5/(m) =3.60/7.5 → same as before.

So, my initial calculation stands: m≈38.54.

But looking at the options, the closest is F:38.44.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the original equation is (18.5 dollars) / (m gallons) = (3.60 dollars) / (7.5 gallons). So, 18.5/dollars = m/dollars? No, perhaps I'm mixing units.

Wait, perhaps the question is written as 18.5/dollars per m gallons equals 3.60/dollars per 7.5 gallons. No, that's not right. I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it this way.

The problem is 18.5 dollars over m gallons equals 3.60 dollars over 7.5 gallons.

So, (18.5 dollars) / (m gallons) = (3.60 dollars) / (7.5 gallons).

So, cross-multiplying: 18.5 *7.5 =3.60 *m.

So, m = (18.5 *7.5)/3.60.

Which is 138.75/3.60 =38.541666...

So, m≈38.54.

Looking at the options, F is 38.44, and G is 40.88. The difference between F and G is 2.44.

So, 38.54 is closer to 38.44 than to 40.88.

Therefore, the correct answer is F:38.44.

Wait, but let me check if I made an error in setting up the equation. Maybe it's (18.5 dollars) / (m gallons) = (3.60 dollars) / (7.5 gallons).

Which is correct.

So, m = (18.5 *7.5)/3.60 = 138.75/3.60 =38.54.

So, the correct answer is 38.54, which is closest to F:38.44.

So, the answer is F.
</think>

The problem requires solving for \( m \) in the equation:

\[
\frac{18.5 \, \text{dollars}}{m \, \text{gallons}} = \frac{3.60 \, \text{dollars}}{7.5 \, \text{gallons}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
18.5 \times 7.5 = 3.60 \times m
\]

Calculating \( 18.5 \times 7.5 \):

\[
18.5 \times 7.5 = 138.75
\]

Thus:

\[
m = \frac{138.75}{3.60} = 38.54
\]

The closest option to \( 38.54 \) is \( 38.44 \) (Option F). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: F**
