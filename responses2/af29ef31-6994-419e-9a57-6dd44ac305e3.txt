Okay, so I've got this physics question here about light entering glass. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when light moves from one medium to another, some properties change. The question is about a beam of monochromatic light entering glass from air. Monochromatic means it's a single wavelength, right?

Wait, so the light is moving from air into glass. Air and glass are both transparent materials. Oh, but wait, glass has a higher refractive index than air. Oh right, the refractive index tells us about how much the speed of light slows down in that medium. And also, I think frequency stays the same when moving from one medium to another because frequency is determined by the source.

So, when light enters a glass window, does its speed change? Yeah, because the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where n is the refractive index. Since glass has a higher n than air, the speed would decrease. So, the beam's speed would change.

What about wavelength? Wavelength changes when moving from one medium to another. The formula is λ = c/n. So, if n increases, λ decreases. So, the wavelength inside the glass is shorter than in air. So the wavelength changes.

And frequency remains the same because frequency doesn't depend on the medium. Only wavelength and speed change. So looking at the options, let's see.

The options are about what changes. The question is, the beam will experience a change in which of these properties. So, the options A through J are about what changes.

Looking at the options:

Option B: speed, frequency, wavelength. No, because frequency doesn't change. So B is out.

Option C: no change at all. That's not right because when light moves from one medium to another, speed and wavelength change.

Option D: frequency only. No, because wavelength and speed are both changing.

Option E: wavelength only. No, because speed is also changing.

Option F: speed and wavelength. Yes, both speed and wavelength change. So F is about two changes.

Option G: speed only. No, because wavelength also changes.

Option H: frequency and wavelength. No, because speed changes.

Option I: speed and frequency. No, because wavelength changes.

Option J: wavelength and frequency. Both change, so J.

Option A: speed and wavelength. So, that's two changes.

Wait, the question is about what the beam experiences. So, the light's properties change. The beam's speed and wavelength change, but frequency remains the same.

So the correct answer is when the beam experiences a change in these properties. So the beam's speed and wavelength change.

So the options are F and J. Which one is correct. Let me read the options again.

Options F: speed and wavelength. J: wavelength and frequency. Which is correct.

Wait, the question says "experience a change in" — so any of these properties change, but not necessarily all.

The beam's speed changes, wavelength changes, frequency doesn't. So which options include these two changing properties.

So the options are F: speed and wavelength, J: wavelength and frequency.

Wait, when light enters a medium, its speed decreases and wavelength decreases as well. So yes.

So the correct answer is F, which says speed and wavelength. But wait, looking at the options, there's option E: wavelength only. No, because speed changes.

So, which of the options are correct. The question is, the beam will experience a change in which of the following.

So, the beam's speed and wavelength change. So F and J are options. Looking at the answer options, F is 'speed and wavelength' and J is 'wavelength and frequency'. Both are correct, but which one is the right choice.

Wait the question is, what is the change in. Let me see the options again. The options are the possible answers.

Wait, the question is: "A beam of monochromatic light entering a glass window pane from the air will experience a change in..." So, what changes. The correct answer is that the speed and wavelength change, and frequency remains the same. So the beam experiences a change in speed and wavelength. So the correct option is F: speed and wavelength.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought of options F and J. So the options are multiple choice, each about a list of possible changes.

Wait, the question is, the beam will experience a change in which of the following.

So, the correct options are both speed and wavelength change, but also frequency doesn't.

So the answers are A: speed and wavelength – so this would be correct.

Wait, but what about wavelength? Oh, because when light enters a medium, its wavelength decreases. So yes, the change is in speed and wavelength.

So the correct answer is option F: speed and wavelength.

When monochromatic light enters a glass window pane from air, its properties change due to the difference in refractive indices between air and glass. Here's the analysis:

1. **Speed**: The speed of light decreases in glass because the refractive index of glass is higher than that of air. This is given by \( v = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( v \) is the speed in the medium, \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, and \( n \) is the refractive index. Thus, the speed changes.

2. **Frequency**: The frequency of light is determined by the source and does not depend on the medium. Therefore, the frequency remains the same when entering glass.

3. **Wavelength**: The wavelength of light decreases in glass because the speed decreases while the frequency remains constant. This is given by \( \lambda = \frac{c}{n} \). Thus, the wavelength changes.

4. **Direction**: The light beam does not change direction; it simply slows down and bends (refracts) at the interface with the glass.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A: speed and wavelength** — Correct, as both speed and wavelength change.
- **B: speed, frequency, and wavelength** — Incorrect, as frequency does not change.
- **C: no change at all** — Incorrect, as both speed and wavelength change.
- **D: frequency only** — Incorrect, as both speed and wavelength change.
- **E: wavelength only** — Incorrect, as speed also changes.
- **F: speed and wavelength** — Correct, as both speed and wavelength change.
- **G: speed only** — Incorrect, as wavelength also changes.
- **H: frequency and wavelength** — Incorrect, as speed changes.
- **I: speed and frequency** — Incorrect, as wavelength changes.
- **J: wavelength and frequency** — Incorrect, as speed changes.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **F: speed and wavelength**, as both these properties change when the light enters the glass.
