Alright, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question about the Stern (1956) theory regarding the nature-nurture controversy. Hmm, okay, let me think. I remember that the nature-nurture debate is about whether genes (nature) or environment (nurture) are more influential in human development. 

Stern's theory, if I recall correctly, was part of a group of theories that suggested that genes, being heritable, play a bigger role. The term "nature-nurture" comes from the idea that both factors are equally important, but in 1956, Stern focused more on the genetic aspect. 

Looking at the options, option A is the "Genetic blueprint" hypothesis. Wait, isn't that more like what was later called the "genetic endowment" theory? Or was it part of the broader perspective? I think the genetic endowment theory posits that genes determine certain traits, like intelligence, and that these are fixed and inherited. So maybe A isn't the correct answer.

Option B is about "Innate potential." That sounds more like the theory of innate abilities, which was more prominent before Stern's work, like from Piaget and Vygotsky. They thought that traits are fixed and not influenced by environment. Stern's theory would be different, focusing on genetics.

Option C is "Environmental impact hypothesis." I'm not sure. I think that's about the idea that environment influences behavior, but that might be more of a behavioral theory rather than the nature-nurture debate.

Option D is "Experience-driven" development theory. I think that's another theory, perhaps by Dollond, that emphasizes the role of experience over genetics. But Stern's theory was about genetics.

Option E is "Blank slate" hypothesis. I'm not sure. The blank slate theory is more about how children learn, like the idea that they learn from their parents. Not directly about nature versus nurture.

Option F is "Behavioral imprinting." That sounds like a theory about how behavior is passed on, which doesn't directly address whether genes or environment are more influential.

Option G is "Trait development theory." I'm not certain. I think trait theory is about how traits are heritable and passed down, which might relate to nature.

Option H is "Cultural absorption" model. That's another theory, possibly by Piaget, where culture shapes development, but this seems more about the environment's influence.

Option I is "Rubber-band" hypothesis. I don't recall that being Stern's. Maybe it's a term from another theory, like the one by Babbitt or some other researcher.

Option J is "Genetic endowment theory." Oh wait! That's likely the one. Stern's theory was part of the genetic endowment theory, which posits that genetic predispositions (endowments) are inherited and set in motion. So the genetic blueprint is heritable and fixed, providing a foundation for development. 

So putting it all together, Stern's theory, which is part of the genetic endowment theory, suggests that genes are the primary factor influencing development, and these are fixed and inherited. So the correct answer should be J: Genetic endowment theory.

The correct answer is **J: Genetic endowment theory**. Stern's theory, part of the genetic endowment theory, posits that genetic predispositions (endowments) are heritable and set in motion, providing a foundation for human development.
