Okay, so I've got this problem here about men building a boat. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is about finding out how many men are needed to build the same boat in 77 days, given that 36 men take 132 days. Hmm, I think this is a work-rate problem. Let me recall how these work.

Work-rate problems usually involve the concept that more workers (or people) can do the same job faster, and the time taken inversely depends on the number of workers. So I remember something about man-days or worker-days. Wait, yes, that's the term. Man-days is the total amount of work, calculated by multiplying the number of workers by the number of days they work.

So if 36 men take 132 days, the total work is 36 * 132. Let me calculate that. 36 times 132. Let's see, 36*100 is 3600, 36*30 is 1080, 36*2 is 72. So 3600 + 1080 is 4680, plus 72 is 4752. So total work is 4752 man-days.

Now, we need to find out how many men (let's call this number 'x') are needed to complete this work in 77 days. Using the same formula, total work is x multiplied by 77 days. So:

x * 77 = 4752.

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 77. Let's calculate that. 4752 divided by 77. Hmm, let's see. 77 times 60 is 4620. 4752 minus 4620 is 132. 77 times 1.727... wait, maybe I should do division properly.

Alternatively, 77 times 62 is let's see: 70*62=4340, 7*62=434; sum is 4340+434=4774. That's a bit more than 4752. So 77*62=4774. Wait, but 4752 is less than that. Let me try 77*62=4774, which is 22 more than 4752. So 77*62 = 4774, which is 22 over. So 77*61 would be 77*(60+1) = 4620 +77=4697. Then 4752 -4697=55. 77*0.727 is about 55. Wait, maybe I should just do 4752 ÷77.

Let me compute 77 * 62: 77*60=4620, 77*2=154, sum 4774. As before, that's 22 more than 4752. So 77 * (62 - (22/77)) = 77*(62 - 0.2857) = approximately 77*61.714 ≈ 4752.

So x ≈61.714. But since the number of men must be a whole number, we'd round up or down. Wait, but the question asks for the exact number needed. Since 77*62 is 4774, which is more than 4752, so x would need to be 62 to get 77*62=4774 man-days, which is more than enough. So 62 men would take 77 days and do more than enough work. However, the question is asking for exactly enough, not more.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The total work is 4752 man-days. We need to find x such that x *77 =4752. So x=4752 /77.

Let me compute this division accurately. 77 into 4752.

77 *60=4620. 4752-4620=132. 77*1.727 ≈132. Wait, 77*1=77, 77*2=154. So 77*1=77, 77*1.727 ≈132. So 77*(60+1.727) = 77*61.727 ≈4752. So x ≈61.727, approximately 61.73. So about 62 men.

Looking at the options, option C is 99, which is way higher. Option H is 50, which is lower. Wait, but the calculation shows approximately 62, but none of the options are exactly that. Wait, let me recheck the math.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total man-days. Let me recalculate 36*132.

36 *132: Let's break it down. 36*(130 +2) =36*130 +36*2.

36*100=3600, 36*30=1080, so 36*130=4680. 36*2=72. So 4680+72=4752. That's correct.

So 4752 man-days is the total work. We need to find x such that x*77=4752.

x=4752/77. Let's compute that.

Dividing 4752 by 77.

77 goes into 4752 how many times?

Well, let's compute 77 * 62 = 4774, which is more than 4752. So 77*61=4774-77=4774-77=4697. Wait, no, 77*60=4620, 4620 +77=4697. 4697 is less than 4752. Then 77*61=4697 +77=4774, which is more than 4752.

So 4752-4774= -22. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 77*61=4774, which is 22 more than 4752. So 4774 -22=4752. So 77 *61=4774; 4774-4752=22. So 4752 is 22 less than 77*61. So 4752=77*(61) -22.

Hmm, but I was trying to find x where x*77=4752. So 4752/77=61.727 approximately.

Wait, 4752 divided by 77. Let me do this division more carefully.

77 ) 4752

77 into 475: 77*6=462. So 6 times. 6*77=462. Subtract 462 from 475: 13. Bring down 2: 132.

77 into 132: 1 time. 1*77=77. Subtract 77 from 132:55. Bring down 0 (since it's 4752, which is 4752.000...).

77 into 550: 7 times (7*77=539). 550-539=11. Bring down 0: 110.

77 into 110 is once, 77. 110-77=33. Bring down 0: 330.

77 into 330: 4 times (4*77=308). 330-308=22. Bring down 0: 220.

77 into 220 is 2 times (2*77=154). 220-154=66. Bring down 0: 660.

77 into 660: 8 times (8*77=616). 660-616=44. Bring down 0: 440.

77 into 440: 5 times (5*77=385). 440-385=55. Bring down 0:550.

Wait, this is getting repetitive. But so far, we have 61.727... So approximately 61.727 men.

So the number of men would have to be about 62. But looking at the options, option C is 99, which is much larger. Option H is 50, which is smaller. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total man-days. Let me double-check 36*132. 36*100=3600, 36*32=1152. 3600+1152=4752. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So the required number is approximately 62 men. But the options don't have 62. The closest is option C, which is 99. Wait, but 99 is much higher than 62. That would mean that with 99 men, the time taken would be 4752/(99) = approximately 48 days, which is less than 77. That's the opposite of what we want. Wait, no, because if 36 men take 132 days, we want to find how many men x can do it in 77 days. So the initial calculation was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the concept that man-days are inversely proportional to time, given the same work. So (men1 * days1) = (men2 * days2).

So,

36 * 132 = x *77

So x= (36*132)/77.

36*132=4752, as before. 4752 /77=62. So x is 62.

Looking at the options, option C is 99, which is not 62. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the division. Let me compute 4752 ÷77.

77 ×60=4620. Subtract that from 4752: 4752-4620=132.

77 ×1=77. 132-77=55. So 60+1=61, and 55 left. 55/77=5/7 ≈0.714.

So 61 and 55/77=61.727. So x is approximately 61.73. So the number of men needed is about 62. But none of the options is 62. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Oh, wait, option B is 36, which is the initial number. Option C is 99. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should approach the problem using man-days.

Total work is 36 *132 =4752 man-days.

To do the same work in 77 days, the number of men needed x is 4752 /77 =62, which is not an option. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I have a mistake.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:84, B:36, C:99, D:132, E:45, F:70, G:62, H:50, I:77, J:120.

Ah, I see, option G is 62. So the correct answer should be 62, which is option G. But why isn't that one of the options? Because the question says, determine the number of men needed, and G is 62.

Wait, but according to the calculation, x is approximately 62. So the correct answer is G:62. But wait, why would the options have 62 as an option, then. So the answer would be G.

To determine the number of men needed to build the boat in 77 days, we use the concept that the total amount of work (man-days) remains constant. 

First, calculate the total work done by 36 men in 132 days:
\[ \text{Total work} = 36 \times 132 = 4752 \text{ man-days} \]

Next, find the number of men (\(x\)) required to complete this work in 77 days:
\[ x \times 77 = 4752 \]
\[ x = \frac{4752}{77} \approx 62 \]

Since 62 is not listed as an option, the closest and correct answer from the options provided is **62 men**, which corresponds to option **G**.
