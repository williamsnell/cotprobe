Okay, so I have this question about the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. I remember that the CPI is a measure of the average change in prices of goods and services purchased by consumers. It's usually calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

The question says the CPI goes from 120 to 150. I need to figure out what this means in terms of price changes. Let me think about how CPI works. If the CPI increases, it means that the cost of living has gone up, right? Because people are spending more.

So, the initial CPI is 120, and it goes up to 150. To find the percentage increase, I should calculate the difference and then see what percentage that is of the original value. 

The difference is 150 minus 120, which is 30. Now, to find the percentage increase, I divide this difference by the original CPI. So, 30 divided by 120 equals 0.25. To convert that to a percentage, multiply by 100, which gives 25%. So, the CPI has risen by 25%.

Looking at the options, option I is " remained constant," which is wrong because it went up. Option J is "Rised 25 percent." That's one of the options. Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, the options are A to J, and I need to choose the correct one. 

Wait, the options are:

A: fallen 50%
B: fallen 25%
C: risen 15%
D: risen 20%
E: fallen 20%
F: fallen 30%
G: risen 50%
H: risen 30%
I: remained constant.
J: risen 25%

So, the correct answer is J. Because 120 to 150 is a 25% increase. That matches option J.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula for percentage change is (new - old)/old * 100. So (150-120)/120 = 30/120 = 0.25, which is 25%. So yes, it's a 25% increase. So option J is correct. So the answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: risen 25 percent.

**Answer: J: risen 25 percent.**
