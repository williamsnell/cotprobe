Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Stevenson's ethical judgments. Hmm, I remember that Stevenson is a philosopher, probably a proponent of universalism or something like that. The question is asking about the primary use of ethical judgments. Let me think through each option.

Option A: demonstrate superior knowledge. I think that's more about his views on knowledge. He might believe in the necessity of universal knowledge, but is that the main use of his ethical judgments?

Option B: provide a basis for legislation. That sounds like he's arguing for a universal moral system, which would be the foundation for laws. But wait, is that the main application of his ethical judgments?

Option C: evaluate the morality of others. That definitely sounds like one of his main points. He's probably emphasizing that ethical judgment is crucial because of the lack of universal moral laws.

Option D: influence the interests of others. That also makes sense because he's advocating for a more universal moral system that affects everyone.

Option E: establish universal moral laws. Another point he's making is that such laws should be universal, not just specific to any culture or society.

Option F: establish universal moral laws. So, are both C and F correct? Or is one more accurate than the other?

Wait, the options are A to J. So let's see the options again. Option C is about evaluating others' morality, and F is about establishing universal laws. Stevenson is known to argue for a universal moral system, so he'd probably spend a lot of time on this. So the primary use would be demonstrating superior knowledge (A), but that's not the main focus. 

Wait, the question is about the primary use. So what's the main application he's making? I think his main argument is that there's no single universal law, so ethical judgments are essential to establish such a system. So C and F would both be correct. But looking at the options, I don't see a choice that combines them. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says "the primary use of ethical judgments is to": looking at the options, C is about evaluating others, and F is about universal laws. Are they both correct, but in the options, they're presented as separate choices. So the options don't combine them. So perhaps the intended answer is C, as that's more directly tied to his argument that we need to evaluate others' morality.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. Stevenson's main point is that there's no universal law, so ethical judgment is crucial to establish such a system. So F might be correct, but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: perhaps the primary use is about distinguishing between the moral and ethical, and using that to establish a universal system.

Wait, another angle: Stevenson's "On Liberty" and "Universal Law" argue that there's no single law but a universal moral system. So his point is about the necessity of a universal moral framework. So that would relate to option F, but I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, the question might be testing knowledge about what Stevenson said. I think Stevenson emphasizes that there's no single moral law, so his ethical judgments are essential for establishing a universal moral system. So the primary use is about evaluating others (C) and establishing the laws (F). But since the options don't combine them, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: demonstrate superior knowledge.

B: provide a basis for legislation.

C: evaluate the morality of others.

D: influence the interests of others.

E: establish universal moral laws.

F: describe one’s own approval of things.

G: express personal beliefs.

H: indicate personal beliefs.

I: none of the above.

J: manipulate emotions.

So the correct answer must be either C or F, but I'm a bit confused. I think Stevenson's main point is that there's no single universal law, so his ethical judgments are crucial for establishing such a system. So option E would be correct. But wait, isn't option E about establishing universal laws? Yes. So the primary use is about establishing universal laws, which would be option E.

Wait, but I thought he argues that there's no universal law, so the primary use of ethical judgments is to evaluate others' morality, which is option C.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Stevenson's main argument is that there's no single moral law, so ethical judgment is essential for establishing a universal moral framework. So the correct answer would be about establishing universal laws, which is option E.

Wait, but another thought: some sources say that Stevenson's main application of ethical judgment is to provide a basis for legislation (option B), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, he might argue that one must demonstrate superior knowledge (A), but that's more of his personal philosophy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. From what I remember, Stevenson wrote "On Liberty" (1821), which discusses the lack of universal moral laws, and "Universal Law" (1824), where he argues for a universal moral system. His main point is that there's no single law, so ethical judgment is necessary to create such a system. So the primary use is to establish universal moral laws, which would be option E.

Alternatively, another perspective: in "The World of Sports" (1836), he discusses the importance of establishing a universal moral system because there's no single law. So he's emphasizing that ethical judgment is essential for that system, which would be option E.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Another approach: looking for which option is correct. I think the correct answer is C, but that's conflicting with my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is F, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the primary use of ethical judgments. Stevenson's main argument is that there's no single universal law, so his use of ethical judgment is for that purpose. So that would be establishing universal moral laws, which is option E.

But I'm not entirely confident. I think I should consider that in the context of the question, the correct answer is C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might have to go with E.

Wait, perhaps looking for more information. Oh, I think I've read that Stevenson's main focus is on the necessity of a universal moral system, so his use of ethical judgment is for that. So the correct answer is E. But I'm not 100% sure, so perhaps I should go with the most accurate option.
</think>

Stevenson's primary focus on ethical judgments is rooted in his argument that there is no single universal moral law. He emphasizes the necessity of establishing a universal moral framework. Therefore, the primary use of his ethical judgments is to **establish universal moral laws**, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
