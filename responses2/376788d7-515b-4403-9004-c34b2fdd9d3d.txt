Okay, so I have this question about Bessel's equation of order one, and I need to find the general solution from the given options. I'm a bit rusty on my differential equations, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that Bessel's differential equation is a second-order linear ODE. The general form is:

x² y'' + x y' + (x² - n²) y = 0,

where n is the order of the Bessel function. For this question, the order n is 1. So the equation becomes:

x² y'' + x y' + (x² - 1) y = 0.

I also recall that the solutions to this equation are known as Bessel functions of the first and second kind, often denoted as J_n(x) and Y_n(x). For integer orders, but n=1 is a half-integer, but the method still applies.

The general solution to a second-order linear ODE is a linear combination of two linearly independent solutions. So, the general solution for Bessel's equation of order n is usually written as y = c₁ J_n(x) + c₂ Y_n(x), where c₁ and c₂ are constants determined by initial conditions.

Looking at the options given:

Option A: y(x) = c₁ sin(x) + c₂ cos(x). Hmm, that looks like the solution to the simple harmonic oscillator equation, which is a different kind of ODE. The Bessel equation is different. So I don't think this is the general solution.

Option B: y(x) = c₁ y₁²(x) + c₂ y₂²(x). Wait, that doesn't make much sense. The square of Bessel functions isn't a standard solution. Plus, the equation would require that y is a combination of squares, which doesn't fit the structure of the ODE. I don't think this is right.

Option C: y(x) = c₁ y₁(x) + c₂ y₂(x). This looks more familiar. If y₁ and y₂ are the two linearly independent solutions (like J_n(x) and Y_n(x)), then this is the general solution. So option C might be correct.

Option D: y(x) = c₁ x y₁(x) + c₂ (x y₂(x)). Wait, no, that's not a standard form. The general solution is a sum of the solutions without any multiplication by x. So D doesn't look correct.

Option E: y(x) = c₁ y₁(x) / (c₂ y₂(x)). That seems more complicated. It's a ratio of the solutions. I don't recall any standard form like this. I think the general solution is a sum, not a fraction. So E probably isn't the right choice.

Option F: y(x) = c₁ ln|x| + c₂ x². Wait, I remember that sometimes solutions have logarithmic terms, but for Bessel functions, ln|x| usually comes into play when dealing with modified Bessel functions. But the general solution for Bessel's equation shouldn't involve logarithms. So F seems incorrect.

Option G: y(x) = c₁ y₁(x) * c₂ y₂(x). That's a product of the solutions. But the general solution is a sum, not a product. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H: y(x) = c₁ / y₁(x) + c₂ / y₂(x). Hmm, that's the reciprocal of the solutions. I don't think this is a standard form. I don't recall any methods to express solutions like that. So H is probably not the correct option.

Option I: y(x) = c₁ y₁(x) - c₂ y₂(x). Similar to option C but with a minus sign. Wait, the general solution can have a negative coefficient. But the key is that it's a linear combination of the two solutions. So I is a valid form, but perhaps it's just another way of writing the general solution, without the arbitrary constants c₁ and c₂ being multiplied by each term. Wait, no, the general solution is c₁ y₁ + c₂ y₂. So I is a correct expression for the general solution, but it's just written as c₁ y₁ - c₂ y₂. Since c₁ and c₂ are arbitrary constants, the negative sign can be incorporated into one of them. So I is a valid form, but it's not the most standard way to write it. However, the question is about the general solution, which is a linear combination with constants.

Option J: y(x) = c₁ e^x + c₂ e^{-x}. That's the solution to the simple harmonic oscillator equation, the modified Bessel function of order zero. But the Bessel equation of order one is different. So J's solution is for a different equation. So J is not the correct general solution for Bessel's equation of order one.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me double-check. The general solution for Bessel's equation of order n=1 is y = c₁ J₁(x) + c₂ Y₁(x), so options C and J (but J is not correct) would be the ones. But wait, let me check if any of the options represent the correct form.

Looking back, option C is y = c₁ y₁ + c₂ y₂. Option J is e^x and e^-x, which is a different solution. So option C is the correct general solution.

Wait, but the question is about the general solution of Bessel's equation of order 1, so the choices are among A to J, and the correct one is C. But wait, what about option E? No, E has a denominator. So the correct answer is option C.

The general solution to Bessel's equation of order one is a linear combination of the two linearly independent solutions, y₁(x) and y₂(x). The standard form is:

y(x) = c₁ y₁(x) + c₂ y₂(x),

where c₁ and c₂ are constants. This corresponds to **Option C**. Other options, such as those involving squares, products, or reciprocal terms, do not represent the correct general solution.
