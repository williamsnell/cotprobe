Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about the Hardy-Weinberg principle. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question says that the frequency of the gene for widow's peak is 0.07. I think that's the frequency of the dominant allele, right? Because in the Hardy-Weinberg model, p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one. So p is 0.07, and q would be 1 - p, which is 0.93.

The problem asks for the frequencies of three categories: (a) homozygous for widow's peak, (b) heterozygous, and (c) individuals lacking the trait.

Wait, no, actually, the question might be phrased as the frequency of individuals who are homozygous for the dominant trait. So, let me think: each case corresponds to the genotype. So, for a dominant trait, the possible genotypes are homozygous dominant (homozygous) or heterozygous.

The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p² is the frequency of homozygous dominant, 2pq is heterozygous, and q² is homozygous recessive.

So, for (a), the frequency of homozygous for the dominant trait would be p squared. Since p is 0.07, p² is 0.07 * 0.07. Let me calculate that: 0.07 * 0.07 = 0.0049. So (a) is 0.0049.

For (b), heterozygous. That's 2pq. So 2 * 0.07 * 0.93. Let me compute that: 0.07 * 0.93 is 0.0651, multiplied by 2 is 0.1302. So (b) is 0.1302.

Then (c), the frequency lacking the trait. That's the q squared. So q is 0.93, so q² is 0.93 * 0.93. Let me calculate that. 0.93 squared is 0.8649. So (c) is 0.8649.

Now, looking at the options provided, let's check each option.

Option C says (a) 0.0049, (b) 0.1302, (c) 0.8649. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

To determine the frequencies of the three categories under the Hardy-Weinberg principle, we start with the given frequency of the dominant allele (p = 0.07). The recessive allele (q) is calculated as \( q = 1 - p = 0.93 \).

### (a) Frequency of homozygous individuals for the dominant trait
The frequency of homozygous dominant individuals is given by \( p^2 \):
\[
p^2 = (0.07)^2 = 0.0049
\]

### (b) Frequency of heterozygous individuals
The frequency of heterozygous individuals is given by \( 2pq \):
\[
2pq = 2 \times 0.07 \times 0.93 = 0.1302
\]

### (c) Frequency of individuals lacking the trait
The frequency of homozygous recessive individuals is given by \( q^2 \):
\[
q^2 = (0.93)^2 = 0.8649
\]

### Matching the results to the options:
- Option C provides \( (a) 0.0049 \), \( (b) 0.1302 \), and \( (c) 0.8649 \), which exactly matches the calculated values.

ANSWER: C
