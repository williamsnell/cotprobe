Okay, so I need to figure out what percentage of the world's population practices open defecation as of 2020. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the statistics, but I remember that open defecation is a common issue. Let me think.

I think the average person in many countries has some form of open defecation, but I'm not sure about the exact number. Wait, I've heard that around 15-20% of the population does it. But wait, I'm not certain. Maybe the data is more recent. Oh, and I remember that in some regions, it's more common than others, so maybe the global rate isn't as high.

Wait, I also recall reading somewhere that the percentage is higher than 10%. For example, in some areas, it's like 20%. But I'm not certain. Let me try to piece this together. So, the options given are A to J, with the highest being J:13%, then I:18%, H:7%, G:5%, etc. 

I think the 2020 data is around 15-20%. Looking at the options, the closest would be in the 15-20% range. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A:4%, B:2%, C:11%, D:9%, E:15%, F:22%, G:5%, H:7%, I:18%, J:13%.

Wait, wait. So 15% is option E, and 18% is option I. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the exact number is 15-20%. I think the average is around 15-20%, but some regions might be higher. But the question is asking for the percentage as of 2020. 

I think the correct answer is around 15-20%. Let me check what I remember from my studies. Oh right, in 2020, it was estimated that about 15-20% of the population had open defecation. So the closest option is E:15% and I:18%. Between these, I think E is 15%, which is the lower end of the range. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the exact figure is 15-20, and the options have 15 as E and 18 as I, so the correct answer is E.

Wait, another point: I remember reading that Europe and the Americas have higher rates, while Asia and North America have lower. So the overall global rate might be somewhere in the middle. So 15-20% seems plausible. So between the options, E is 15%, and I is 18%. So which is the correct one for the question?

Alternatively, maybe the exact figure is 15%. Let me thinkâ€”another approach: if I recall, the global open defecation rate is around 15-20%. So looking at the options, 15% is option E, and 18% is I. So the answer would be E:15%.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 18% was the correct answer in some sources. Or was it 15-20%? Let me think again. Oh, I think that the 2020 data was around 15-20%. So 15% is the lower end, 18% is higher. So the best fit would be E:15% and I:18%. The actual data might have a specific number, but perhaps the closest option is 15%.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 15%, so option E is correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another angle: perhaps the correct answer is higher. I think I've heard it's around 15-20%, so the correct option would be either E or I. But wait, the options give E as 15 and I as 18. So the answer is either E or I. But the question says "about what percentage".

Wait, another thing: I remember reading that the global rate is around 15-20%, so the correct percentage would be in that range. So looking at the options, E is 15% and I is 18%. So the correct answer would be E:15% or I:18%. Now, I'm trying to remember, perhaps the exact number is 15-20%, but the options don't have both. So perhaps the correct answer is E:15%.

Wait, but I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to find out. Another approach: I think the correct percentage is 15-20%. So the options have 15 (E) and 18 (I). So the answer is either E or I. I think the correct answer is 15%, so option E.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: I remember that in some countries, like the USA, it's 20%, in others it's 15%. So the overall rate could be in that range. So the correct answer would be E:15%. Alternatively, perhaps the data suggests 15-20%, so 15 is the lower end, but both E and I are possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 15%, so E is correct. I think that's the case.
