Question:

A city ordinance forbids washing vehicles parked on city streets. A man washes his car while it is parked on the street in front of his home. The water forms a puddle in the street, which freezes over during the night. Early the next morning, a car driving on the street slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. If the driver of the car sues the man and asserts that the man was negligent per Se, which of the following additional facts would help the man the most?

Options:

A: The man had already planned to dry the water before it froze, but was unable to because of an unexpected emergency.
B: The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.
C: The city had been warned about the icy conditions but had not salted the streets.
D: The driver is not a resident of the city.
E: The man had been washing his car on the street for years without any previous incidents.
F: The driver had previously been involved in multiple accidents due to reckless driving.
G: The man had placed a warning sign near the puddle to alert drivers of the potential hazard.
H: The man was not aware of the ordinance.
I: The driver was driving at an excessively high speed at the time of the accident.
J: The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.

Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this negligence question. Let me read through the scenario carefully.

So, the city has an ordinance that says you can't wash your car if it's parked on city streets. A man washes his car, which is parked and he's parked it on the street. The water forms a puddle, which freezes over during the night. The next morning, the car slides into the ice and crashes into a tree.

The question is about whether the man was negligent under the strict liability theory, and which additional facts would help him the most in establishing negligence.

The options are A to J. I remember that in strict liability negligence, a defendant is liable if they violated a law, even if it's a strict liability offense. So, the man's action—if he violated the ordinance—is a strict liability issue. Therefore, any additional facts that show he was at fault would help.

The man was supposed to not wash his car if it's on the street. He did, so that's a clear violation. But when the water freezes, perhaps he was supposed to dry it before it freezes to avoid the puddle. So maybe his action was a failure to dry it.

Looking at the options, which ones would show he was negligent.

Option A: The man planned to dry the water before it froze but couldn't because of an emergency. So, he was supposed to dry it, but couldn't because of a reason (emergency). That's a clear failure to act, which would be negligence.

Option B: He lives in the neighborhood and saw him washing the car the day before. That doesn't directly show negligence. It shows he was there, but maybe not that he was negligent. Unless he saw him speeding or something else, which might show he was negligent, but in this case, the scenario is that he washed it, so seeing him elsewhere might not connect.

Option C: The city had warned about icy conditions but didn't salt the streets. So, maybe the city had already warned but didn't salt the streets. If the city had warned, then the freezing would be a problem. But if the streets were already icy, the puddle would form. However, without saltation, the freezing might not have occurred. But the fact that the city had already warned but didn't salt the streets—wait, the city ordinance requires washing only if it's on the street. So if the city had already warned, the man might have been expected to wash it. But if the streets were already icy, maybe the puddle formed without saltation. But the question is about the city not salting, so maybe the freezing didn't happen, which would make him negligent because he was supposed to dry it, but the freezing didn't occur. Wait, but the scenario says the water formed a puddle, which froze. So C says the city had warned but didn't salt. Hmm, if the city had warned, the puddle would have formed, but without salt, maybe it didn't freeze. But the scenario says it did. So maybe C is not relevant, or perhaps it's not the best choice.

Option D: The driver is not a resident. If he's not a resident, maybe he didn't know about the ordinance. But if he's not a resident, the city doesn't have the authority to enforce the ordinance, but that doesn't directly show negligence. The fact that he was driving on the street without washing would show he was negligent. But the scenario says he was washing it. So D doesn't directly support negligence, unless the driver didn't realize he was violating the law, but the scenario says he was washing, so D might not be the best.

Option E: The man was washing on the street for years without any issues. So, he's a consistent problem solver. That would support negligence, as he's not just once; he's past that. So this would help.

Option F: The driver had previous accidents due to reckless driving. That might suggest he was reckless, but the question is whether he was negligent. So it's not directly showing negligence, unless he was speeding or something else, but the scenario doesn't mention anything about his behavior.

Option G: He placed a warning sign to alert drivers. That's a good thing because it shows he was taking steps to avoid this situation. So that would help establish negligence by showing he was at fault.

Option H: The man was not aware of the ordinance. So he was in violation of the law without knowing. That would support negligence. Because he knew he was violating the law, or was unaware of the law.

Option I: The driver was driving too fast. If he was speeding, that could be negligence, perhaps because he didn't have the time to dry the puddle, or because he didn't have the means.

Option J: The city council enacted the ordinance after someone was hit by a truck. So maybe the ordinance was too late to enforce on that incident. But in this case, the man was driving on the street and not being stopped, so I don't think this would help.

So, the best options are A, E, G, H, I.

Which of these would help the man the most.

The scenario is that the man was washing his car on the street, which is prohibited. The water freezes over. The man's car then slides into the ice. So the key points are: he violated the law by washing on the street, which is prohibited. The freezing is a result of that violation.

So, any facts that show he was at fault would help.

Which facts would best show that?

Option A: He had an emergency. So maybe he was too busy or needed immediate attention. That would show negligence.

Option E: He was washing on the street for years, which suggests that he was not making the mistake the first time. So that would support negligence.

Option G: He placed a warning sign. That would show he took steps to prevent this situation, which would help.

Option H: He wasn't aware of the law. That shows he was negligent.

Option I: The driver was driving too fast. Maybe he didn't have enough time to dry the puddle, leading to the accident. That would be negligence.

Option G and H and E are the most about his action.

So the best options are A, E, G, H.

Wait, but the question is which additional fact would help him the most. So which of these is the best.

The options are A, E, G, H.

Which of these is the best?

In the scenario, the first thing to show negligence is that he was at fault. So, for A, he had to dry the water before it froze. If he didn't, that's a clear failure. If he did dry it, that's failure.

If he had to dry it, which he didn't, then he was negligent.

E: He was washing on the street for years without issues. So, the first time he violated the law, he was not at fault, so the subsequent times (years) support.

G: He placed a warning sign. That's a good thing because it shows he knew or should have known to avoid this. So that's a positive factor for the defense, but in the scenario, he did violate, so if he was acting in good faith, maybe not. But in this case, he was acting in violation.

H: He was not aware of the law. So he didn't know about the ordinance, which is a clear negligence.

I: If the driver was driving too fast. So, perhaps he didn't have enough time to dry the puddle, leading to the accident.

G: He placed a warning sign. So that's a positive.

So, which of these are the best.

The best I can think is that the best options would be A, E, G, H, I.

But which one is the best choice?

The question says, which additional fact would help the man the most. So, for the man, if he is the plaintiff, he needs to be proved negligent.

So, the best facts to show that he was negligent are:

A: He was unable to dry the water before it froze.

E: He was washing on the street for years without any other issues.

G: He placed a warning sign to alert drivers.

H: He was not aware of the ordinance.

I: He was driving too fast.

Each of these would help, but which is the most relevant?

Wait, the question is which fact would help the man the most. So, the question is which fact would best support his case, i.e., which fact would help him prove his case.

So, the best facts would be those that show he was negligent.

So, looking at the options, which one would best support this.

Option A: He planned to dry before it froze but couldn't because of an emergency. That's a failure to act, so it's a clear negligence.

Option E: He was washing on the street for years without any issues. So, it's a consistent violation, so the first time he was at fault, the rest support.

Option G: He placed a warning sign. So, that's a positive factor, but in the scenario, he did violate, so if that's a positive, maybe not directly helpful unless the fact is that he did it because of the warning.

Wait, in this scenario, he did wash the car, so the fact that he placed a warning sign doesn't directly cause the accident unless he was at fault.

Hmm.

But if the man had placed a warning sign, that might have suggested he was taking steps to avoid this. But in this case, he was.

Wait, perhaps the best facts are A and E.

Because, in the scenario, he was washing on the street, which is against the law, so it's a clear violation. If he had to dry it, he was negligent. If he was washing on the street for years, it supports that he wasn't at fault the first time. But the fact that he was washing on the street (option E) would also support the case, implying that he was negligent.

So, both A and E would help.

But the options are single choices. So the best option would be the one that best shows he was negligent.

So, the correct answer is A because it directly shows he was unable to dry the water, leading to the ice, which would be a clear failure.

Alternatively, E might be more about the consistency of his behavior, which supports his negligence.

But in the options, the best might be A.

Wait, the options are as given. So, in the options, the choices are:

A: ... was unable to dry before freezing.

So, that would show that he was negligent because he failed to act.

Which would best support his case.

So, the answer is A. So, the man would be helped the most by A.
</think>

The question revolves around determining which additional fact would best support the plaintiff's case of negligence under strict liability for the man who violated a city ordinance by washing a car parked on city streets. The key fact is that the man failed to dry the water before it froze, leading to the car sliding into icy conditions during the night.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: The man had already planned to dry the water before it froze but was unable to because of an unexpected emergency. This directly demonstrates failure to act, which is a clear failure of negligence.
- **B**: The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw him washing the car the day before. This does not show negligence but could support the driver's case by indicating the man was near the scene.
- **C**: The city had warned about the icy conditions but did not salt the streets. The scenario mentions the water forming a puddle, so this fact does not directly address the freezing issue and is not relevant.
- **D**: The driver is not a resident of the city. This does not help establish negligence and is unrelated to the scenario.
- **E**: The man had been washing his car on the street for years without any previous incidents. This shows consistent behavior, supporting the claim that he was negligent the first time.
- **F**: The driver had previously been involved in multiple accidents due to reckless driving. This does not address the violation of the ordinance and is irrelevant.
- **G**: The man had placed a warning sign near the puddle. This demonstrates a positive take on the situation, which supports the defendant's case but does not directly establish negligence.
- **H**: The man was not aware of the ordinance. This directly shows negligence by indicating he was in violation of the law.
- **I**: The driver was driving at an excessively high speed. This could be a factor in negligence if it led to the accident, but the scenario does not provide evidence of such an action.
- **J**: The city council enacted the ordinance after someone was hit by a passing truck. This does not directly relate to the violation of the ordinance in question.

### Conclusion:
The best fact to help the man the most is **A**, as it directly demonstrates failure to act and is a clear indication of negligence. This would best support his case for negligence.
