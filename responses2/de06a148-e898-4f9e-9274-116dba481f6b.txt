Okay, so I've got this legal question here about which law of negligence applies in a case involving a truck driver and a bus driver in different states. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that a truck driver from State A and a bus driver from State B were involved in a collision in State B. The truck driver filed a federal diversity action in State B claiming damages from the bus driver for negligence. The question is asking which law of negligence the court should apply.

First, I remember that a federal diversity action is a common law thing. Like, if the plaintiff is from a state, the court can apply the federal laws of that state. But wait, there's more to it.

Now, the specifics here are about the states of the drivers. So State A is the truck driver's state, and State B is where the accident happened and the plaintiff is from. I think the key point here is about the states' jurisdiction and how their laws apply.

I recall that in case law, the state of the plaintiff's state of citizenship plays a role. Oh right! So the U.S. Supreme Court has held that states' laws are the primary basis for determining negligence, especially in cases involving people from different states. So if the plaintiff is from State A and the defendant is from State B, the court should apply the laws of State A and State B.

Wait, but what about the accident itself? Sometimes accidents can be in a state that's not the jurisdiction of either party. But in this case, the accident happened in State B, and the plaintiff is from there. So maybe the primary factor is the state of the plaintiff's citizenship.

Looking at the options, option G says the court should apply the negligence law of State A. Hmm, no, that doesn't sound right because the plaintiff is from State A. Option I says the court should apply State B's law, but that's not considering the plaintiff's state of citizenship.

Wait, more accurately, the court should consider the laws of both states where the plaintiff and defendant reside. So the correct approach is to look at their respective laws. But the options don't directly say that, so I have to pick the closest.

Looking at the options, option B says the court should consider the negligence laws of both states and apply the one most appropriate. But the options don't have that exact wording. The closest is option D, which says international negligence, but that doesn't apply here.

Wait another thing, the Supreme Court ruled that states' laws are the primary source for determining negligence in federal cases. So the court should look at the state of the plaintiff's state of citizenship and the defendant's state of citizenship. But the options don't have all that, so perhaps the best approach is to consider the plaintiff's state of citizenship.

But wait, the plaintiff is from State A, so their state of citizenship is State A. The defendant is from State B. But the primary law in such cases is the state of the plaintiff's state of citizenship. So the court should apply the laws of State A.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. The Supreme Court said that states' laws are the primary basis, so the court should apply the laws of the states of both the plaintiff and defendant. So State A and State B. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Option G says State A. Option I says State B. But I think the correct approach is to consider both, but the options don't have that. So the next best option is perhaps G, but that doesn't seem right because the plaintiff is from State A. Maybe I'm wrong about State B's case.

Wait, wait. Another angle: the common law applies to states, and the statesâ€™ laws are the primary basis when the plaintiff is from a different state. So when a plaintiff is from State X and the defendant is from State Y, the state of the plaintiff's state of citizenship is State X.

So in this case, the plaintiff is from State A, so the court should apply the laws of State A. But looking back at the options, option G says State A's law. But the options don't have an option B that combines both; the correct approach isn't just one state.

Wait, the question is a federal diversity action. So the federal law of the state where the accident occurred (State B) is the primary law. But the question is which state's law applies to the case, given the state of the plaintiff.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this differently. I've read that in cases involving people from different states, the court should consider the state of the plaintiff's state of citizenship. So perhaps the answer is G: the court should apply the negligence law of State A, the truck driver's state of citizenship.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says "State A's law and their respective states' laws apply." So perhaps the correct answer is G, which is State A's law. But I'm not sure because I thought the state of the plaintiff's state of citizenship is State A, so the court should apply that.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says "State A's law and their respective states' laws apply." So among the options, G is the only one that directly refers to the plaintiff's state of citizenship.

Alternatively, another approach: the U.S. Supreme Court held in several cases that states' laws are the primary basis for determining negligence in federal cases. So the court should look at the state where the plaintiff resides. The plaintiff is from State A, so the court should apply the laws of State A.

Wait, but the accident is in State B. So that's another state. So the state of the state where the accident occurred is State B, but the plaintiff's state of citizenship is State A.

But the question is about which state's law applies to the case. So the court should apply State A's law because the plaintiff is from State A. So perhaps option G is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says "State A applies." Let me look again.

The options are:

A: Common law of State A.

B: Consider both and apply the applicable law.

C: Law of the state with the highest population.

D: International law.

E: Law of the accident location.

F: Determine state's law and apply.

G: Law of State A.

H: State A and State B.

I: State B.

J: State A and citizenship.

So the correct answer should be G, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Supreme Court held that states' laws are the primary basis, so the court should apply the states of both. But since the options don't have that, the closest is G.

Wait, another thought: the Supreme Court held that the state of the plaintiff's state of citizenship is State A. So the court should apply the laws of State A. Therefore, the correct answer is G.

The correct approach is to apply the state of the plaintiff's state of citizenship, which is State A. The Supreme Court has held that states' laws are the primary basis for determining negligence in federal cases involving people from different states. Therefore, the court should apply the laws of State A.

ANSWER: G
