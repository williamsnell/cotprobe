Question:

A buffer is made from equal concentrations of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Doubling the volume of the buffer solution by adding water has what effect on its pH?

Options:

A: It causes the pH to fluctuate unpredictably.
B: It causes the pH to equalize with the water's pH.
C: It causes the pH to become extremely basic.
D: It neutralizes the pH completely.
E: It significantly decreases the pH.
F: It has little effect.
G: It significantly increases the pH.
H: It doubles the pH value.
I: It changes the pH asymptotically to the pKa of the acid.
J: It causes the pH to become extremely acidic.

Okay, so I have this question about buffers and how volume affects their pH. Let me think. I remember that buffers resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. They're made of a weak acid and its conjugate base, right.

The question says the buffer has equal concentrations of the weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, but when you double the volume by adding water, how does that affect things? I remember that the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). Both concentrations are equal, so the ratio is 1, so pH equals pKa. That's the buffer's pH.

Now, if the volume is doubled, the concentrations of both the acid and base should halve because concentration is moles per volume. So [A^-] becomes half and [HA] also becomes half. The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is still 1, so pH remains pKa. So the pH doesn't change. 

Looking at the options: option F says it has little effect. So the pH remains the same as before adding water. So the correct answer should be F.

The buffer's pH remains unchanged when the volume is doubled because doubling the volume halves the concentrations of both the weak acid and its conjugate base, leaving the ratio unchanged. Thus, the pH equals the pKa, unaffected by volume change.

Answer: F
