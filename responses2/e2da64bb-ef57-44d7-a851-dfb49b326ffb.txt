Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Mars's atmospheric pressure and trying to find the mass of its atmosphere. Let me think through this.

The question says Mars has a pressure of 600 pascals. Gravity on Mars is about 4 m/s², and the surface area is 145 million square kilometers. Hmm, right, I remember that pressure relates to force per unit area. So pressure (P) is force (F) over area (A), so F = P * A. But I need the mass of the atmosphere, not force. Oh wait, but pressure is force per area, and force can be related to mass via weight, which is mass times gravity.

Wait, right, so the pressure at the surface of a planet is roughly given by the density of the atmosphere times the acceleration due to gravity. But wait, actually, the barometric formula for pressure is P = rho * g, where rho is density. So rho is mass per unit volume.

But I'm trying to find the mass of the atmosphere. The volume would be the surface area times some height, but I don't think I have the height. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the pressure to the mass of the atmosphere in a different way.

Wait, another approach: The average pressure at a certain altitude is the product of the atmospheric density and the local gravity. Since I don't know the height, maybe I can model it as a thin shell around the planet. So the pressure exerted by the atmosphere is roughly the density times the gravity. So, pressure P = rho * g, where rho is the density of the atmosphere.

But wait, the density of the atmosphere is mass per volume. So if I can find the total mass, that's density times volume. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total mass by considering the pressure. Let's see: the pressure is 600 Pa. Pressure is force per area, so force is P*A. The force here is the weight of the atmosphere, which is mass times g. So, mass = (P * A) / g.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The force exerted by the atmosphere is P times the surface area. Since pressure is force per unit area, that's correct. And that force is the weight of the atmosphere, which is mass times g. So mass = (P * A) / g. So that's the formula I need.

Let me plug in the numbers.

But wait, the pressure is given as 600 pascals. Let me calculate P*A. A is 145,000,000 square kilometers. Oh wait, I need to convert that into square meters because SI units are needed. So 1 km² is (1000 m)^2 = 1e6 m². So 145 million square km is 145e6 * 1e6 = 145e12 square meters.

Wait, no. 145,000,000 km² is 1.45e8 km². Wait, no, 145 million km² is 1.45 × 10^8 km². So converting that to m²: 1 km² = (1000 m)^2 = 1e6 m². So 1.45e8 km² would be 1.45e8 * 1e6 = 1.45e14 m².

So P = 600 Pa, A = 1.45e14 m². So P*A = 600 * 1.45e14 = 8.7e16.

Then, mass = P*A / g. g is 4 m/s². So mass = 8.7e16 /4 = 2.175e16 kg.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 2.2e16 kg, option D is 2.2e15, etc.

Wait, but the options are presented as 2.2 × 10^x kg. So I have 2.175e16 kg, which is approximately 2.2e16. So the closest option would be C: 2.2e16 kg.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. So I've got P = 600 Pa, A = 145e6 km².

Wait, 145 million km² is 145,000,000 km², which is 1.45e8 km². Since 1 km² is 1e6 m², so 1.45e8 * 1e6 = 1.45e14 m². Correct.

So P*A is 600 * 1.45e14 = 8.7e16.

Divided by g (4 m/s²) gives 2.175e16 kg. So that's approximately 2.2e16 kg, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Is the pressure given as the total pressure or the pressure at the surface? Because I'm assuming that the entire atmosphere's weight is supported by the pressure. So, yes, I think that's correct. Because the pressure P is the total pressure exerted by the atmosphere, which is the weight of the atmosphere divided by the surface area.

Another way: Pressure (P) is equivalent to the total force per unit area. So, the total force is P * A. That force is the weight of the atmosphere, so mass * g = P * A.

So mass = (P * A) / g. So that's the formula. So I think my calculation is correct.

To determine the mass of Mars' atmospheric pressure, we start with the formula for pressure, which is pressure \( P \) equals force per unit area (\( P = F / A \)). Since force is the weight of the atmosphere, \( F = m \cdot g \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Rearranging, the mass is given by:

\[
m = \frac{P \cdot A}{g}
\]

### Given Data:
- Pressure \( P = 600 \, \text{Pa} \)
- Surface area \( A = 145,000,000 \, \text{km}^2 \)
- Acceleration due to gravity \( g = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)

### Step 1: Convert the surface area to square meters
Since \( 1 \, \text{km}^2 = (1000 \, \text{m})^2 = 10^6 \, \text{m}^2 \), the surface area in square meters is:

\[
A = 145,000,000 \, \text{km}^2 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^2/\text{km}^2 = 1.45 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total force exerted by the atmosphere
The total force exerted by the atmosphere is:

\[
F = P \cdot A = 600 \, \text{Pa} \times 1.45 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2 = 8.7 \times 10^{16} \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 3: Relate the total force to the mass of the atmosphere
The total force is equal to the weight of the atmosphere, \( F = m \cdot g \). Solving for mass:

\[
m = \frac{F}{g} = \frac{8.7 \times 10^{16} \, \text{N}}{4 \, \text{m/s}^2} = 2.175 \times 10^{16} \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated mass is approximately \( 2.2 \times 10^{16} \, \text{kg} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
