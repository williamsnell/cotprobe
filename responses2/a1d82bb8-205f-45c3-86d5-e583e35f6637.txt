Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about measuring a firm's market power, specifically looking at a measure that's higher means more market power. The options are A through J, each with a different formula. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which measure is a good indicator of a firm's monopoly pricing or market power. I remember that a higher value of this index suggests the firm has more market power. So, the measure should be something that when calculated, a higher number means more power.

I recall that the concept involves the firm's markup over marginal cost. The formula I remember is something like (Price minus Marginal Cost) divided by Marginal Cost. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the Lerner Index is (P - MC)/P. That's the one I remember. But wait, another related measure is the markup over average cost or something like that. Another formula I think is (P - MC)/MC^2 or perhaps (P-MC)/MC^2? Or maybe (P-MC)/MC.

Wait, let me think. The Lerner Index is (P - MC)/P. If we rearrange that, it's (P/MC - 1)/P, which simplifies to (1 - MC/P)/P. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Another formula I've heard is (P - MC)/MC. Wait, I think that's the formula for the firm's price-cost markup. Because (P - MC) divided by MC is the markup. But does that directly indicate market power?

Wait, another thing I'm trying to remember is the formula that's often used as a measure of market power. I think it's (P - MC)/MC. Or maybe (P - MC)/MC squared. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I think a measure called the "mark-up" in terms of elasticity. There's a formula for that. The firm's elasticity of demand would be -P/Q. The markup is related to the price elasticity of demand. The formula is (P - MC)/MC = (1 - 1/elasticity). So, if the elasticity is less than 1, the firm has more market power. Wait, no, because if demand is more elastic, that means the firm can charge higher prices without losing too many sales, so higher market power.

Wait, the elasticity of demand is calculated as |(dQ/dP) * (P/Q)|. But the formula for the firm's markup is (P - MC)/MC. So this would be (1 - 1/elasticity). So, higher (P - MC)/MC would mean higher elasticity, which is higher market power.

So, if the measure is (P - MC)/MC, then a higher value indicates more market power.

Looking at the options, option H is (P - MC)/MC. Option E is (MC - P)/P², which is the negative of H's numerator divided by P². So, H is positive and would be higher than E if P>MC. Option I is (MC² - P)/MC, which is the same as (MC - P/MC). Not sure.

Wait, what's the formula for the elasticity of demand? It's (P/Q) * (dQ/dP). But the markup is (P - MC)/MC. I think that's the correct formula.

So, looking at the options, option H is (P - MC)/MC. So that would be a higher value when P is much higher than MC, which indicates more market power.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written as (P - MC)/MC, but sometimes it's written as (P - MC)/MC squared. Oh, I'm a little confused about that. Let me think again.

Another formula I've heard is the measure (P - MC)/MC. So that's option H. So, when the value is higher, more market power. So, I think option H is the correct answer. I'll go with that.

The question asks which measure represents a firm's market power, where a higher value indicates greater market power. The correct measure involves the markup over marginal cost, specifically (P - MC)/MC. This formula calculates the firm's price-cost markup, which is a key indicator of its market power. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option H**: (P - MC)/MC is the correct formula for the price-cost markup, which directly reflects market power.
- Other options include variations with squared terms or different sign combinations, which do not align with the standard measure.

Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: H
