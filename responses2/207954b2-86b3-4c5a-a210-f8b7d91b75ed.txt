Question:

Describe the structure and function of the nuclear membrane.

Options:

A: The nuclear membrane is a single layer structure
B: The nuclear membrane has no connection with the endoplasmic reticulum
C: The nuclear pores facilitate the movement of large particles only, such as whole organelles
D: The nuclear membrane dissolves during interphase and reforms during mitosis
E: The nuclear membrane is a continuous extension of the plasma membrane
F: The nuclear pores are closed structures
G: The nuclear membrane is composed of a single phospholipid bilayer with no associated proteins
H: The nuclear membrane contains no pores, instead relying on transport proteins embedded in the membrane for substance exchange
I: The nuclear membrane consists of two leaflets of membrane, one facing the nucleus and the other facing the cytoplasm, and has many nuclear pores which provide a means for nuclear-cytoplasmic communication.
J: The nuclear membrane is completely impermeable, blocking all substances from entering or exiting the nucleus

Okay, so I've got this question about the nuclear membrane and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about the nuclear membrane.

The nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure, right? It's one of the major regulatory boundaries in eukaryotes, separating the nucleus from the cytoplasm. I remember that it's made up of two leaflets. One leaflet is facing the nucleus, and the other is facing the cytoplasm. Oh wait, and it has these tiny pores, called nuclear pores, which allow communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. So, when a molecule is in the nucleus, it can pass through the pores into the cytoplasm, and vice versa. That makes me think option I is correct.

Looking at the options: Option I says the membrane consists of two leaflets, one for each compartment, and has nuclear pores for communication. That sounds right. What about other options? Option E says it's a continuous extension of the plasma membrane, but no, the nuclear membrane is separate and has these nuclear pores.

Option J suggests it's completely impermeable, which is opposite of what I remember. So J is wrong. Option A claims it's a single layer, which I don't think is the case. Option B says there's no connection with the ER, which is incorrect because the ER is involved in some processes, like protein synthesis, but the membrane itself isn't connected in that way. Option C talks about nuclear pores moving large particles, which would relate to something like the rough ER, but the main function of the nuclear membrane is communication.

Option D says it dissolves during interphase and reforms during mitosis. I don't think that's true. The nuclear membrane doesn't dissolve; it just reforms to allow specific transport proteins to pass. Option E is about being a continuous extension of plasma, which is wrong.

Option F says nuclear pores are closed. No, they're open for communication. Option G says it's a single phospholipid bilayer. That's not accurate because the nuclear membrane has a double layer with more complex structures, including proteins. Option H suggests no pores, which contradicts what I know.

So considering all that, the correct answer should be option I. It accurately describes the structure and function.

The correct answer is I: The nuclear membrane consists of two leaflets facing the nucleus and cytoplasm, with nuclear pores allowing communication.
