Okay, so I've got this question about Python and string indexing. The question is: What is the output of "abc"[-1] in Python 3? The options are from A to J, each with different strings or values.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that in Python, when you access a string using square brackets, it's like a slice. So, for "abc", which is a string of length 3, the indices are 0, 1, 2.

Wait, the question is "abc"[-1]. That would be the last character. So, in Python, the index -1 refers to the last character. Let me confirm. Oh right, because in Python, negative indices count from the end. So -1 is the last character, -2 is the second last, etc.

So for "abc", the indexes are:
0: 'a'
1: 'b'
2: 'c'

So accessing [-1] would return 'c'. Looking at the options, J is 'c'. So the answer should be J.

The last character is 'c', so the answer is J.

Answer:
J
