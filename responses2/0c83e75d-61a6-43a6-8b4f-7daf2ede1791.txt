Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the percentage of people in India as of 2013 who think political parties are corrupt. The question gives me a list of percentages, and I have to choose the correct one. 

First, I should probably try to recall any recent or notable events related to political corruption in India. I remember hearing that the Indian government has been accused of controlling the judiciary and increasing the power of political parties. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact figures.

I think there was a survey or a poll conducted by some organizations in 2013. From what I remember, one of the key figures involved might be the Indian Congress or some other political party. Oh right, there was a report where a significant number of people expressed support for political parties. 

I also recall that around 86% of the people in India considered political parties corrupt. That seems familiar. Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me think again. If the question is about the last character of the chosen answer, then the correct percentage would determine the letter. 

Looking at the options, option A is 86%. So if the correct answer was 86%, then the last letter would be 'A'. I think that's the one. I should make sure that 86% is indeed the correct figure for 2013. Oh, right, I think that was the figure from the survey where the Indian government's corruption case was a big topic. So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A, which corresponds to 86%.

Answer: A
