Question:

Explain what difficulties would arise if messenger RNA moleculeswere not destroyed after they had produced some polypeptidechains.

Options:

A: mRNA molecules would integrate into the cell's DNA, altering the genome
B: mRNA molecules would deplete nucleotides in the cell, halting all RNA synthesis
C: mRNA molecules would compete with DNA for resources
D: mRNA molecules would bind to other mRNA molecules, preventing translation
E: If an mRNA molecule were not destroyed, it would continue to synthesize its protein, leading to an excess of this protein in the cell, serious depletion of the energy store, and accumulation of unneeded proteins that may harm the cell or organism.
F: mRNA molecules would cause the ribosomes to malfunction and stop protein synthesis
G: mRNA molecules would leave the cell nucleus and be unable to return for further protein synthesis
H: mRNA molecules would inhibit the function of tRNA
I: mRNA molecules would prevent DNA replication during cell division
J: mRNA molecules would mutate and produce incorrect proteins

Okay, so I have this biology question about mRNA molecules and what happens when they aren't destroyed. Hmm, I remember that mRNA is involved in protein synthesis. Let's think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the difficulties that arise if mRNA isn't destroyed after making some polypeptide chains. So, what's the normal process? mRNA is transcribed from DNA into a double helix, and then the RNA spirals around the DNA. When the RNA unwinds, the complementary strand forms a complementary hairpin structure. Once this structure forms, the RNA unwinds again, and the polypeptide chain is transcribed.

So after producing a polypeptide, the mRNA is usually degraded. Why? Oh right, mRNA has a lot of structures, like hairpins, and it's held together by a lot of nucleotides. In the case of translation, the ribosomes bind to the mRNA, and the rRNA and tRNA pair with the polypeptide. But when the mRNA is fully translated, it becomes a closed complex. The complex contains a lot of the mRNA, including the rRNA, and the ribosome's tRNA. Since there's no more mRNA to continue binding, the complex can't function. This is called the "leaky" state. So if mRNA isn't degraded, it keeps accumulating, causing issues.

Looking at the options, option E says that if mRNA isn't destroyed, it continues synthesizing the protein, leading to excess protein and energy depletion. That makes sense because the mRNA is still there, so the ribosome keeps translating it. Without being degraded, the mRNA just accumulates, which the cell doesn't handle. This would lead to more protein being made, which uses more energy. The cell's energy store would get drained, and any extra proteins might not function well, possibly leading to issues like cell stress.

Option J says mRNA mutates and produce incorrect proteins. Wait, does that happen after translation? Like, do the mRNA molecules change? I think translation is more accurate, but degradation after translation could lead to mutations. Or maybe the mRNA is more stable. No, mRNA degradation is more due to the closed complex. So I don't think J is correct. 

Option E is the one I'm leaning toward. So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: if mRNA molecules were not destroyed after producing some polypeptide chains, they would continue to synthesize their protein, leading to an accumulation of excess protein in the cell. This would cause serious depletion of the cell's energy store and potentially lead to the accumulation of unneeded proteins, which could harm the cell or organism.

Answer: E
