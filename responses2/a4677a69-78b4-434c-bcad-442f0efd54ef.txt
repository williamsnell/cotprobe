Okay, so I have this question about Mitchell et al. (1997) and their theory related to stakeholder influence. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Mitchell's work is about stakeholder power dynamics. The question talks about several determinants of stakeholder influence. The blanks are asking about the variables that matter in this context.

Let me read the sentence again: "According to Mitchell et al (1997) ______, the perceived ability of a stakeholder to influence organisational action, ________ whether the organisation perceives the stakeholder's actions as desirable, proper and appropriate and ________, the immediacy of attention the stakeholder claims require, determine stakeholder ________."

So, I need to fill in four blanks, each with a different concept.

The first blank is about the perceived ability of a stakeholder to influence organizational action. From what I recall, this relates to stakeholder power or influence. I think it's called " Legitimacy." Because a stakeholder's power to influence depends on how well they're seen as a good fit for the organization. So the first blank is Legitimacy.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, another thought. Maybe "Salience." Because if a stakeholder is highly desired (legit), they can influence more. But wait, some theories say that the link is bidirectional. For example, a stakeholder's importance (legitimacy) affects their ability to influence. Also, the influence determines their perceived importance. So, the first blank is about perceived ability, which is the 'legitimacy' of the stakeholder. So the first blank is Legitimacy.

Then, the second blank is about whether the organization perceives the stakeholder's actions as desirable, proper, and appropriate. That sounds like the 'Urgency' of the stakeholder's actions. Because if they're urgent, people are more likely to take action. So the second blank is Urgency.

Next, the third blank is about whether the stakeholder claims the immediacy of attention. That would relate to 'Salience.' Because if a stakeholder is seen as crucial (legit, first blank), they'll be more salient, so they can make immediate decisions. So the third blank is Salience.

Finally, the fourth blank is about what determines stakeholder influence. That's about their 'Power.' The fourth blank is Power.

Putting it all together: Legitimacy, Urgency, Salience, Power. Looking at the options, which one has these four in order?

Looking at the options:

A: Legitimacy, Power, Urgency, Salience → No, because it's Leg, Power, Urg, Sal.

B: Leg, Urgency, Salience, Power → Yes, that's the order I have.

Wait, let me check all options again.

Option B: Legitimacy, Urgency, Salience, Power. That's exactly what I thought.

So the correct answer is B.

The correct answer is B: Legitimacy, Urgency, Salience, Power.
