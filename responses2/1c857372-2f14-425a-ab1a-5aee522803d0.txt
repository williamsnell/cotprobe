Question:

A woman owns a tract of land located in a state in the Midwest. On June 1, 2005, the woman sells to a husband and wife an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by the husband). The deed to the husband and wife reads as follows: "To (husband) and (wife) and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. "On June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to the husband and his brother for $125,000 (the husband pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and the brother pays the balance). The deed to the husband and the brother provides: "To (the husband) and (the brother) and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. "The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman. The husband then dies. The brother then dies. The cousin is thus the owner of

Okay, so I've got this real estate question here. Let me try to work through it carefully. I'm a bit new to property law, but I'll go step by step.

The woman owns a tract of land and sells it in two steps. The first sale is in June 2005. She sells half an interest for $100,000. The deed says the husband and wife are tenants, but not joint tenants. So, that means they each own 1/2, right? So the husband gets 1/2, the wife gets 1/2. But wait, how does that work when she sells exactly half? So, she's the owner of 1/2, and the husband and wife each take 1/2 each. That makes sense.

Then, the next step is June 2006. She sells the remaining half. She sells her remaining 1/2 (so total she owned) to her husband and brother for $125,000. The wording says the husband pays $80k, the brother pays $45k. The deed says the husband and brother are joint tenants. So, for the 1/2 land, they're joint tenants. That means each of them owns 1/2 of the 1/2 land, so each gets 1/4? Wait, no. Wait, if the 1/2 land is divided as joint tenants, so each owns half of the 1/2 land. So each would have 1/4 of the original property. But wait, the husband's total ownership so far is 1/2 (from the first sale) plus 1/4 (from the second sale), making it 3/4. The brother only owns 1/4 of the original land, right?

But wait, let me double-check. The original land was split as 1/2 to husband and wife each. Then, the husband and brother each take 1/2 of the 1/2 land, so 1/4 each. So the husband now owns 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 of the land, and the brother owns 1/4. But wait, wait. Is that correct?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the percentages. Let me think again. The original property is split as 1/2 to husband and wife. That's one sale. Then, the husband and wife sell their 1/2 to the husband and brother. Now, the 1/2 land is sold as joint tenants, so each gets 1/2 of that 1/2. So each (husband and brother) gets 1/4 of the original land. So the husband now owns 1/2 (from the first sale) plus 1/4 (from the second sale) = 3/4. The brother has 1/4. 

But wait, what about the ownership in the second deed? Because in the first sale, the husband and wife are joint tenants, so they each own 1/2 of the land. So each has 1/2. Then, the husband and brother each own 1/2 of that 1/2, so 1/4 each.

So the husband now owns 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 of the land, and the brother owns 1/4. 

Then, the husband conveys all his rights under the two deeds. So the husband's 3/4 is his entire ownership. Then the husband dies, and the brother dies. The question is about the cousin's interest.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the cousin is the owner. So let me make sure: the initial land is split into two parts.

First sale (June 2005): woman sells 1/2 to husband and wife. Each of them has 1/2.

Then, June 2006: woman sells her 1/2 to husband and brother, who are joint tenants. So each gets 1/2 of the 1/2, so 1/4 each.

So, the husband's total is 1/2 (from first sale) + 1/4 (from second sale) = 3/4. The brother has 1/4.

But the question says the husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds. So the cousin is another owner. Wait, but in the second sale, the two are joint tenants, but the cousin is the owner. Wait, no, the cousin isn't part of the second sale. The second sale is between the husband and the brother. So the husband and brother each own 1/2 of the 1/2 land each. So each has 1/4 of the original property. So the husband has 3/4 (from first sale) plus 1/4 (from second sale) = 3/4. The brother has 1/4.

Wait, but the husband gives everything under the two deeds to the cousin. So the cousin is the owner of the entire property? Or is the cousin another person? Wait, the question says the husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds. So the cousin is the owner of whatever the husband has. 

Wait, the first sale was of 1/2. The second sale was of the remaining 1/2. So the total land is 1. The husband has 3/4, brother has 1/4. But wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me think again.

The woman's total ownership is 100% of the land. She sells 1/2 (so she's left with 1/2) to her husband and wife for $100k. So the husband and wife each get 1/2. So the husband has 1/2, and the woman has 1/2.

Then, the woman sells her remaining 1/2 (so she's gone from 1/2 to 0) to her husband and brother. So the husband and brother split the remaining 1/2 as joint tenants. So each of them gets half of 1/2, which is 1/4.

So the husband's total is 1/2 (from the first sale) plus 1/4 (from the second sale) = 3/4. The brother has 1/4.

But the husband conveys all his rights (under the two deeds) to his cousin. So the cousin is now the owner of the 3/4 portion of the land. Wait, but that can't be right because the brother has only 1/4. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the conveyance.

Wait, no. Let's clarify the entire process.

1. First, the woman has all the land. She sells 1/2 to the husband and wife. Each gets 1/2. So the husband has 1/2, the woman has 1/2.

2. Then, she sells her 1/2 to the husband and brother. The deed says they are joint tenants. So each of them gets 1/2 of the 1/2, which is 1/4. So the husband now has 1/2 (from the first sale) plus 1/4 (from the second sale) = 3/4. The brother has 1/4.

But the husband conveys his entire interest under the two deeds to the cousin. So the husband has both the 1/2 (first sale) and the 1/4 (second sale) as his interests. So when he conveys all those to the cousin, the cousin owns 3/4 of the land. But wait, that can't be right because the entire land is 1. So 3/4 would be the amount the cousin owns.

But wait, let me make sure. The first sale: husband gets 1/2. The second sale: husband gets 1/4. So 1/2 + 1/4 is 3/4. So the cousin, who is the owner of the husband's interests, owns 3/4. So the answer would be option E: an undivided one-third? Wait, wait, no. Let me check.

Wait, the options are:

A: 1/5

B: 1/4

C: 0

D: 3/4

E: 3/5

F: 1/6

G: entire land

H: 1/3

I: 3/4

J: 5/6

Wait, the options are:

A: 1/5

B: 1/4

C: 0

D: 3/4

E: 3/5

F: 1/6

G: entire

H: 1/3

I: 3/4

J: 5/6

Option D is 3/4, and E is 3/5. So what's the correct answer?

Wait, but let me think about possible miscalculations. The husband owns 1/2 (from first sale) and 1/4 (from second sale), totaling 3/4. So that's 3/4 of the land. So the cousin is the owner of 3/4. So the answer should be option D: 3/4.

Wait, but let me think again. Because in the second sale, the husband and brother are joint tenants. So each gets 1/2 of the 1/2 land. So each of them gets 1/4. So the husband has 3/4 (1/2 + 1/4), the brother 1/4. 

So the husband's entire ownership is 3/4, so when he conveys all that to his cousin, the cousin owns 3/4. So the answer would be D: 3/4.

Looking back at the options, option D is "an undivided one-third interest in the land." Wait, no, the option I just read says option D is 3/4. So the correct answer is D.

The woman owns a tract of land and sells it in two steps. In June 2005, she sells half of it for $100,000, with the husband and wife each owning 1/2. She then sells the remaining half in June 2006 to the husband and brother, who are joint tenants. This means each of them owns 1/2 of the 1/2 land, totaling 1/4 of the original property each. The husband now owns 1/2 (from the first sale) + 1/4 (from the second sale) = 3/4 of the land. He conveys all his rights, title, and interest to his cousin, who thus owns 3/4 of the land.

The correct answer is **D: an undivided one-third interest in the land.**

ANSWER: D
