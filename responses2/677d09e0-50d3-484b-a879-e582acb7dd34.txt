Okay, so I have this physics problem here about TNT exploding. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that TNT burns and releases about 4.2 x 10^6 joules per kilogram. Oh wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, no—wait, is the energy per kilogram about 4.2e6 joules? Or is it per gram? Because I've heard TNT's energy is around 4.2 million joules per kilogram. Let me check the question again.

The question says, "the explosive TNT burns, it releases about 4.2 x 10^6 joules/kg." Oh, wait, that's per kilogram. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because I remember TNT's energy being around 4.2 million joules per kilogram. Wait, but wait, 4.2e6 J/kg? That's 4.2 million J per kilogram. So, that's a lot. Because 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 4.2e6 J/kg is 4.2e3 J/gram. Wait, that's a lot of energy. Because if you're per kilogram, that's 4200 kJ/kg. Wait, that's about 10 million BTU per kg, since 1e6 BTU is about 1e9 J. So, 4.2e6 J/kg is 4.2e3 kJ/kg, which is 4.2e3 * 10^3 J/kilogram? Wait no, no—wait, no, 1 kJ is 10^3 J. So 4.2e6 J/kg is 4.2e6 / 10^3 kJ/kg? No, wait, 4.2e6 J is 4.2 x 10^6 J. So, 4.2e6 J per kg. That's a lot.

The question then says, the molecular weight of TNT is 227. Oh right, so molecular weight is 227 g/mol. So, per molecule, it's 4.2e6 J/kg divided by the molar mass. But wait, I'm getting confused with units.

Wait, the question is asking, the energy released by one molecule of TNT in the process. Oh right, so one molecule of TNT. So, I need to find the energy per molecule.

Wait, but first, I need to clarify: is the 4.2e6 J/kg per kilogram the energy per kilogram, which is 4.2e6 J/kg. Or is it 4.2e6 J per kilogram. Wait, 4.2e6 J/kg is 4.2e9 J per kilogram, because 4.2e6 J/kg = 4.2e9 J/kg. Because 1e3 kg is a kilogram. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 4.2e6 J/kg is 4.2e6 J per 1000 grams. So, 4.2e3 J per gram. But that would be 4200 kJ per gram, which is extremely high. That can't be right. Because I don't think that's the case. Maybe I misunderstood the question.

Wait, another possibility: the question says, the TNT releases about 4.2 x 10^6 J/kg. So, per kilogram. So, 4.2e6 J per kilogram.

Wait, but if that's per kilogram, that's 4200 kJ per kilogram. But that's a lot of energy. Let me think: is the energy per kilogram 4.2e6 J/kg? That's 4.2e6 J per kg. But 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 4.2e6 J/kg is 4.2e3 J/g. That's 4200 J per gram. That's way too high because TNT's energy is not that high. So perhaps I misread. Oh wait, perhaps the 4.2e6 is per kilogram, which is 4.2e6 J per kg. So, 4.2e6 J/kg.

Wait, but that's a lot. Let me proceed, perhaps I'll cross-check the numbers later.

Wait, the problem says: what is the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes? So, first, I need to find the energy per molecule, then use Einstein's equation E=mc² to find the mass change.

So, first, find the energy per molecule.

The energy per kilogram is 4.2e6 J/kg. Because per kilogram, it's 4.2e6 J. So, per kilogram, that's 4.2e6 J. The molar mass is 227 g/mol, which is 0.227 kg/mol.

So, the number of moles per kilogram is 1 kg / 0.227 kg/mol = 4.4058 mol/kg.

Each mole has 6.022e23 molecules, so the number of molecules per kilogram is 4.4058 mol/kg * 6.022e23 molecules/mol = approx 2.65e24 molecules/kg.

Each molecule's energy is the energy per kilogram divided by the number of molecules. So, energy per molecule = 4.2e6 J/kg / (2.65e24 molecules/kg) = approximately (4.2e6)/(2.65e24) J/molecule.

Let me compute that: 4.2e6 / 2.65e24 = approximately (4.2 / 2.65) * 1e-18. 4.2 / 2.65 is about 1.58. So 1.58e-18 J per molecule. Looking at the options, option A is 1.58e-18. So that's the energy per molecule.

So, the first part of the question is that the energy released by one molecule is about 1.58e-18 J.

Now the second part: the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes. So, using Einstein's equation, E=Δm c². So, fractional change is Δm / m.

Wait, wait. The energy released is E = Δm c². So, Δm = E / c². The fractional change is Δm/m.

So, let's compute that.

Given E is 4.2e6 J/kg.

Wait, no. Wait, because the energy per kilogram is 4.2e6 J/kg. So, the energy per kg is 4.2e6 J. So, per kg, that's 4.2e6 J. So, per kg, the energy is 4.2e6 J.

So, for one kilogram, the energy is 4.2e6 J, which comes from the mass.

So, mass change is E / (c²). Because E = Δm c² → Δm = E / c².

So, for the entire kilogram, the mass change is (4.2e6 J) / ( (3e8 m/s)^2 )

Let me compute that.

First, c is 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s².

So, 4.2e6 J / 9e16 (m²/s²) = (4.2e6) / (9e16) = approx 4.666...e-11 kg.

Because 4.2e6 / 9e16 = (4.2/9) * 1e-10 = 0.4666...e-10 kg, which is 4.666e-11 kg.

Wait, so that's the change in mass for the entire kilogram.

Wait, but the question is about the fractional change in mass, which is (Δm) / m.

Wait, wait, the question says, "the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes?"

Wait, but the energy per kg is 4.2e6 J, so the mass change is 4.2e6 / ( (3e8)^2 ) = 4.2e6 / (9e16) = (4.2/9) * 1e-10 = 0.4666...e-10 kg.

So, 0.4666e-10 kg is the mass change for one kg.

The fractional change is (0.4666e-10 kg) / (1 kg) = 4.666e-11, approximately 4.67e-11.

Looking at the options, option J is 4.7e-11, which matches.

So, the fractional change is about 4.7e-11.

Now, looking at the options, option J is 4.7 × 10^-11.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because the initial energy per kg is 4.2e6 J. So, mass change is 4.2e6 / (9e16) = (4.2/9)*1e-10 = 0.4666e-10 kg, which is 4.666e-11 kg.

Wait, so the fractional change is 4.666e-11 / 1 kg → 4.666e-11.

So, about 4.7e-11.

But looking at the options, option J is 4.7e-11. So that's the fractional change.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. The question is about the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes.

Wait, but wait, the question says: "the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes?" So, per kilogram, the change is 4.2e6 J per kg / (9e16) = 4.666e-11 kg. So, the fractional change is 4.666e-11 / 1 kg = 4.666e-11.

Looking at the options: option J is 4.7e-11, which is the same as 4.7 × 10^-11.

So, the fractional change is about 4.7e-11.

Looking back at the options, option J is 4.7e-11.

Wait, but the options include option I as 9.8eV. Oh, because the options are given in different units. So, option J is the fractional change.

Wait, but the question is about the energy per molecule, which I calculated as 1.58e-18 J. So, looking at the options, option A is 1.58e-18.

So, the first part is 1.58e-18 J per molecule, the second is about 4.7e-11.

But the options include both, so the question is likely asking for both, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that combines both. So perhaps the question is asking for the fractional change.

Wait, the question says, "What is the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes?" So that would be the second part, the option J.

But I'm a bit confused because the initial step was to find the energy per molecule, which is option A, and the fractional change is option J.

Wait, the question in the problem statement is structured as a multiple-choice, and each option is a different possible answer. So in the problem, it's possible that the question is asking for both the energy per molecule and the fractional change. But the user's question says, "the energy released by one molecule is ...", followed by the fractional change. So the question is probably asking for both. But none of the options have both.

Wait, looking at the options, the user provided a list of options, each is a single value. So the question must be asking for either the energy per molecule or the fractional change. The way the question is phrased, it's a single question. Let me read it again.

The question: "As the explosive TNT burns, it releases about 4.2 x 10^6 joules/kg. The molecular weight of TNT is 227. Find the energy released by one molecule of TNT in the process. What is the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes?"

Wait, that's two separate questions, but the user has presented it as one. So, the user probably has a typo, but perhaps the correct approach is to find the energy per molecule, and the fractional change. But the options don't have both.

Wait, the user says, the problem is presented with options, but perhaps the correct answer is the fractional change, which is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the energy per molecule, which is option A.

But looking back, the question is structured as two parts: first, the energy per molecule, and second, the fractional change in mass. But the options are only single values. So perhaps the question is only asking for the fractional change in mass, and the energy per molecule is an intermediate step.

The question's phrasing is a bit confusing, but perhaps the intended question is the fractional change in mass.

But the options given in the problem include both. So perhaps I'm supposed to pick the correct answer based on the calculation.

Wait, the options for the fractional change are: A: 1.58e-18 J (that's the energy per molecule), but that is the first part. The fractional change is the second part, which we calculated as 4.7e-11.

Looking back, the problem after the calculation is, perhaps, leading to one of the options. So, the two answers would be 1.58e-18 J (option A) and 4.7e-11 (option J). So, the problem is asking for both, but the options don't have a pair. So perhaps the question is only asking for the second part.

Wait, the problem says, 'find the energy released by one molecule of TNT in the process. What is the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes?' So it's two separate questions. But the way the question is structured, perhaps the intended answer is the fractional change, but it's presented as two separate options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the fractional change. But looking at the given options, option J is the fractional change (4.7e-11), which is the correct answer for the second part.

Wait, but the first part, the energy per molecule, is option A. So the question is, perhaps, the first part is a separate option, and the second is another.

Wait, but the user's question is a single problem, so perhaps the first part is a separate calculation, and the second part is the answer to the question.

Wait, the problem is presented as a single question. So, the first part is to find the energy per molecule, and the second part is the fractional change. So, looking for the correct option for the fractional change, which is option J, 4.7e-11.

But the first part, the energy per molecule, is 1.58e-18 J, which is option A.

But the question says, "the energy released by one molecule of TNT in the process." So the answer is option A.

Wait, but the question also asks, "What is the fractional change in mass that occurs as one kg of TNT explodes?" So the question is expecting both answers, but the options don't have both. So perhaps the question is only asking for the fractional change, which is option J.

Wait, but the user's problem is not clear. But in the given options, option J is 4.7e-11, which is the fractional change.

Wait, but wait: the question is phrased as two separate questions. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option J, and the energy per molecule is option A.

But the way the question is presented, perhaps the actual options are only for the second part. Alternatively, the question is about the energy per molecule, but perhaps the user has a mistake in the problem setup.

But given the options, the correct answer for the fractional change is option J.

So, the correct answer for the second part is option J: 4.7 × 10^-11.

The problem involves calculating two aspects of TNT energy: the energy released by one molecule of TNT and the fractional change in mass as one kilogram of TNT explodes. Here's the analysis:

### Key Information:
1. **Energy per kilogram (E):** 4.2 × 10⁶ J/kg.
2. **Molecular weight (MW):** 227 g/mol = 0.227 kg/mol.
3. **Avogadro's number (N_A):** 6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol.

---

### Part 1: Energy per Molecule
The energy released per molecule is calculated as:

\[
\text{Energy per molecule} = \frac{\text{Energy per kilogram}}{\text{Molecular weight}} = \frac{4.2 \times 10^6 \, \text{J/kg}}{0.227 \, \text{kg/mol}}
\]

\[
\text{Energy per molecule} \approx 1.86 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{J}
\]

This matches **option A (1.58 × 10⁻¹⁸ J)**, but note that the correct value is closer to 1.86 × 10⁻⁸ J, which is not an option. Therefore, **option A is incorrect** for this part.

---

### Part 2: Fractional Change in Mass
To find the fractional change in mass, use Einstein's equation \( E = \Delta m c^2 \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Solving for \( \Delta m \):

\[
\Delta m = \frac{E}{c^2}
\]

\[
\Delta m = \frac{4.2 \times 10^6 \, \text{J}}{(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})^2} = \frac{4.2 \times 10^6}{9 \times 10^{16}} \, \text{kg}
\]

\[
\Delta m \approx 4.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{kg}
\]

The fractional change in mass is:

\[
\text{Fractional change} = \frac{\Delta m}{m} = \frac{4.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{kg}}{1 \, \text{kg}} = 4.67 \times 10^{-11}
\]

This matches **option J (4.7 × 10⁻¹¹)**.

---

### Final Answer:
The energy released by one molecule of TNT is approximately 1.86 × 10⁻⁸ J, but **option A (1.58 × 10⁻¹⁸ J)** is not correct for this part. The fractional change in mass as one kilogram of TNT explodes is approximately 4.7 × 10⁻¹¹, which corresponds to **option J**.
