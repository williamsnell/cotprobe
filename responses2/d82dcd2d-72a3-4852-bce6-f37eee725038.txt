Question:

The managers of Disney World are considering changing the amount charged on their Humpty Dumpty ride. Presently they charge 25 cents a mile and this results in about 6,000 passengers each day. The managers believe the number of daily passengers will rise by 400 for each 1 cent decrease in the admission charge and drop by 400 for each 1 cent increase. What is the admission charge which maximizes the daily revenue?

Options:

A: 30 cents
B: 22 cents
C: 18 cents
D: 10 cents
E: 12 cents
F: 25 cents
G: 15 cents
H: 35 cents
I: 20 cents
J: 28 cents

Okay, so I have this problem about Disney World's Humpty Dumpty ride. The managers want to change the charge to maximize daily revenue. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the current charge is 25 cents, and they have about 6,000 passengers daily. The problem says that if they decrease the charge by 1 cent, 400 more passengers come each day. Conversely, if they increase the charge by 1 cent, 400 fewer passengers come. So the number of passengers is affected linearly by the price change.

I need to model this as a function to find the optimal price that maximizes revenue. Revenue is calculated as price multiplied by quantity. So revenue = price * passengers.

Let me define variables. Let x be the number of 1-cent decreases. So the new price is (25 - x) cents. The number of passengers increases by 400x, so the new number is (6000 + 400x) passengers.

Revenue R can be written as:
R = (25 - x) * (6000 + 400x)

I should expand this equation to find R in terms of x, then find its maximum.

Expanding R:
R = 25*6000 + 25*400x - x*6000 - x*400x
= 150,000 + 10,000x - 6,000x - 400x²
= 150,000 + 4,000x - 400x²

So R(x) = -400x² + 4,000x + 150,000

This is a quadratic equation, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-400), the parabola opens downward, so the vertex is the maximum point.

The x-coordinate of the vertex (which gives the maximum R) is at x = -b/(2a), where a = -400 and b = 4,000.

x = -(4,000) / (2 * (-400)) = -4000 / (-800) = 5

So x is 5. That means the optimal is 5 cents decrease from 25, which is 25 -5 = 20 cents.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A:30, B:22, C:18, D:10, E:12, F:25, G:15, H:35, I:20, J:28.

So 20 cents is option I.

Alternatively, I could check the revenue at x=5 and maybe nearby points to ensure it's the maximum. Let me compute R for x=4,5,6.

At x=4:
Price = 25 -4 =21 cents
Passengers =6000 +400*4= 6000+1600=7600
R=21*7600 = 159,600

At x=5:
Price=20 cents
Passengers=6000+400*5=6000+2000=8000
R=20*8000=160,000

At x=6:
Price=19 cents
Passengers=6000+400*6=6000+2400=8400
R=19*8400= 159,600. 

So R is higher at x=5 (20 cents) than at x=4 or 6. So the maximum is indeed at 20 cents, option I.
</think>

The optimal price is achieved when the revenue is maximized. By modeling the revenue as a function of the number of 1-cent decreases (x), the quadratic equation R(x) = -400x² + 4,000x + 150,000 is derived. The vertex of this parabola, calculated at x = 5, corresponds to a 20-cent decrease from the original price, resulting in a revenue-maximizing price of 20 cents.

Answer: I: 20 cents
