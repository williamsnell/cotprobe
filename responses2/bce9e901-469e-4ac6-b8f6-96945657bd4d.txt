Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question is about a generator's potential difference. Hmm. 

The problem says a 2.4 kilowatt generator delivers 10 amperes. They're asking at what potential difference it operates. The options are A through J with various voltages. 

Wait, I remember that power, voltage, and current are related by Ohm's Law. Oh right, Ohm's Law is P = IV. So power equals current multiplied by voltage. Oh, but wait, what's the unit here? Oh, right, power is in watts, current is amperes, and voltage is volts. 

So the formula is P = I * V. I need to solve for V. That would be V = P / I. Got it. But wait, I should make sure the units are correct. The power is given as 2.4 kilowatts. Oh right, kilowatt is 1000 watts, so 2.4 kilowatts is 2400 watts. Current is 10 amperes. 

So plugging in the numbers: V = 2400 W / 10 A. Let me calculate that. 2400 divided by 10 is 240. So V should be 240 volts. Looking at the options, option D is 240 volts. 

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes these problems can get tricky. Oh right, the formula in terms of potential difference is V = IR, where I is current and R is resistance. But wait, power is also related to resistance and current as P = I² R. So combining these: V = I * R. And since P = I² R, substituting, P = I * (P/I²) )? Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: P = V² / R. But that's the same as I² R. Hmm, perhaps I don't need to go that way because the direct formula is V = P / I. 

So in this case, the generator's output voltage would be 240 volts. Looking back at the choices, option D is 240 volts. So the answer should be D.

To determine the potential difference at which the generator operates, we use the formula for power in terms of current and voltage: 

\[
P = I \cdot V
\]

Rearranging for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{P}{I}
\]

Given:
- Power (\( P \)) = 2.4 kilowatts = \( 2400 \, \text{watts} \)
- Current (\( I \)) = 10 amperes

Substituting the values:

\[
V = \frac{2400}{10} = 240 \, \text{volts}
\]

Thus, the potential difference is 240 volts, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
