Question:

What is the law of diminishing marginal utility?

Options:

A: This principle suggests that as more units of a good are consumed, the total utility decreases.
B: The law asserts that the marginal utility of a good increases at a decreasing rate as consumption increases.
C: The law suggests that utility does not change with consumption and remains static over time.
D: It states that each additional unit of consumption yields greater utility than the previous one, indefinitely.
E: It's a rule that says the first unit of a good or service consumed yields the least utility.
F: The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility refers to the fact that as successive units are consumed, the utility derived from each additional unit decreases beyond some point.
G: It indicates that the utility derived from each additional unit consumed remains constant no matter how many units are consumed.
H: It's the principle that states that as the quantity of a good decreases, the utility derived from each additional unit increases.
I: The law states that utility increases with each unit consumed.
J: The law claims that consumers derive equal utility from each additional unit consumed, regardless of the quantity already consumed.

Alright, I've got this question about the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. Hmm, I remember studying this in my economics class. Let me think through it.

Okay, so the concept is about how the additional satisfaction, or utility, from each new unit of a good decreases as more units are consumed. I think it's called marginal utility. So the marginal utility of each unit is lower than the previous one.

Looking at the options now. Option A says that as more units are consumed, total utility decreases. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the total utility would increase, but the marginal (additional) utility decreases. So A is incorrect.

Option B: It says the marginal utility increases at a decreasing rate. That doesn't sound right. I thought that's not the case. As more units are consumed, the additional utility each time goes down, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Suggests utility doesn't change and is static. No, that's not right either. The marginal utility decreases, so C is wrong.

Option D: Each additional unit gives more than the previous. That's the opposite of what's happening. Diminishing doesn't mean increasing; it's about decreasing. So D is incorrect.

Option E: First unit gives the least utility. Wait, I thought the opposite. The first unit is the one that gives the most utility because it's the highest point for marginal utility. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Says that each additional unit's utility decreases beyond some point. That aligns with what I remember. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that the additional utility from each successive unit decreases. So F seems correct.

Option G: Utility remains constant with each unit. No, that's not right. It's decreasing, so G is wrong.

Option H: It says that as quantity decreases, utility increases. Wait, that's not the law. The law is about increasing consumption leading to decreasing marginal utility. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Utility increases with each unit. That's the opposite of diminishing. So I is wrong.

Option J: Says consumers derive equal utility from each unit, regardless of quantity. No, that's the constant marginal utility, which is a different concept. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be F.

The correct answer is F. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that each additional unit of consumption yields less utility than the previous one. This decreases beyond a certain point, meaning that the marginal utility diminishes as more units are consumed.

Answer: F
