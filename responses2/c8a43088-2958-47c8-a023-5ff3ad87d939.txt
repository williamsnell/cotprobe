Question:

Carol Collector was a serious antique car buyer, and was always searching for Thunderbirds in good shape. She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address "to view a picture of the car," which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was "used and sold as is." When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for

Options:

A: Carol, because the internet picture was of a car that had never been driven, not the actual used car she was to buy.
B: Carol, because the seller was not negligent in providing a picture of the car.
C: Carol, because the "as is" disclosure was not totally effective.
D: The seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was a 1968 model.
E: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.
F: The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold "as is."
G: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.
H: The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.
I: The seller, if Carol can prove she relied on the picture when making her purchase.
J: Carol, because the seller provided a picture of the car, regardless of its condition.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a case law situation, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's read through it carefully.

Carol Collector bought a Thunderbird, and she saw this newspaper ad for a 1964 model for $25,000. The ad also had a website address showing a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol went to the site, viewed the picture, and bought the car. Then, when she picked it up, she found out it was a 1968 model, which isn't rare. She didn't want to pay what she paid because the 1968 model was cheaper. She sued the seller, and the question is, what's the likely outcome?

The options are A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, let's understand the facts. The ad is a newspaper ad, not a direct sale, right? They provided a website link. Carol went to the site, saw a picture of a 1964 Thunderbird with perfect conditions, and bought it for $25k. Then, when she got home, she found out it was a 1968 model, which is not rare, and was worth less. She sued the seller, and now the question is about the outcome.

The key here is the contract. The contract says the Thunderbird is "used and sold as is." So, Carol agreed that the car would be used and sold as it is. That means the seller is responsible for the actual condition of the car, not for its condition as depicted in the ad.

So, when she went to pick it up, she found out it was a 1968 model. What happened? Well, the contract says it's "used and sold as is." So, the seller's responsibility is to deliver the car in its actual condition. But the ad showed a 1964 model, which is a different model.

Now, what's the issue here? There are several possible legal theories, like negligence, the "as is" clause, etc.

Let's think about the "as is" clause. The contract says the T-Bird is "used and sold as is." So, the seller is responsible for delivering the car as it is—without any modifications or repairs. The ad shows a 1964 model, but Carol bought a 1964 one. The fact that the ad shows a different model doesn't necessarily mean the seller is liable, because the contract explicitly states that the car will be sold as is.

But wait, the key here is that the seller's contract doesn't specify whether it's delivered as is or not. The contract is that the car will be sold as is. So, the seller has a duty to deliver it in its actual condition. The ad doesn't necessarily create that condition; the contract does.

So, if the seller provided a picture but didn't specify that the car is to be sold as is, then the contract might not cover the condition of the car. Therefore, if the contract only says "used and sold as is," the seller can't be held liable for the actual condition of the car, because the contract doesn't explicitly require that.

Alternatively, some people might argue that the ad was a way to demonstrate the car's condition, but the contract explicitly excludes reliance on such images. So, the contract's language is that the car will be sold as is, which means the seller has a duty to present the car in its actual condition.

So, if the seller didn't make any changes or modifications to the car, and the ad showed a different model, then the seller isn't at fault. The fact that the car was misrepresented in the ad (showing a 1964 instead of 1968) doesn't make the seller liable because the contract was clear about "as is."

So, looking at the options, the possible answers are:

A: Carol, because the internet picture was of a car that had never been driven, not the actual used car she was to buy.

But wait, the contract says it's "used and sold as is," so the image in the ad isn't directly part of the contract. The image was just a visual aid. So, the image's condition doesn't affect the contract. Therefore, option A might not be correct because the contract doesn't require the image to be accurate.

B: Carol, because the seller was not negligent in providing a picture of the car.

Hmm. The contract doesn't mention anything about the seller's negligence, so maybe not. The picture might have been taken to show the condition, but the contract's language doesn't imply that the seller was negligent in that.

C: Carol, because the "as is" disclosure was not totally effective.

Wait, "as is" disclosure refers to the seller's responsibility to present the car in its actual condition. If the contract says "used and sold as is," then the seller's liability is limited to delivering the car as it is. So, if the car was misrepresented (as in, the ad showed a different model), the seller isn't liable for that. Therefore, the "as is" clause is not the issue here.

D: The seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was a 1968 model.

Hmm. If the seller didn't know or was negligent in providing the picture, perhaps they could be liable. But the contract says the seller was not negligent—because the contract says "used and sold as is," which is a standard that the seller is expected to meet. So, unless the seller was negligent, which they weren't, Carol's claim is about negligence, not the contract's wording.

E: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.

Well, the contract says the car is "used and sold as is," so the seller isn't responsible for the image's accuracy. So, the fact that the image was misrepresented doesn't make the seller liable, because the contract doesn't require the image to be accurate. So, option E is incorrect.

F: The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold "as is."

I think that's not correct. The buyer was aware—Carol was aware that the car was a 1964 model. But the seller's liability is about the condition of the car, not the buyer's awareness. So, option F is incorrect.

G: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.

Wait, could the seller be liable because the 1968 model is less valuable? But the contract says the car is "used and sold as is," and the seller isn't bound by the value of the model. The contract doesn't say anything about the value of the model. So, if the seller only sold 1964 models, maybe the higher value 1964 is not transferable. But the contract doesn't say that. It just says the car is "used and sold as is." 

But the question is about the outcome. So, the main issue is that the contract doesn't require the seller to deliver the car in its actual condition. So, the fact that the ad showed a different model doesn't affect the contract. So, unless the seller can prove that the car was of equal value, which is not part of the contract, Carol can't claim that.

H: The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.

Wait, the contract says the car is to be sold as is. So, the seller is expected to present the car in its actual condition. If the seller didn't make any changes, the contract doesn't require them to state that. So, if the seller didn't make any changes, then the contract's "as is" clause wouldn't be breached. Therefore, the seller isn't negligent in not stating the "actual car to be sold," but the question is about their own negligence.

I: The seller, if Carol can prove she relied on the picture when making her purchase.

Hmm. The contract is about the condition of the car. The ad showed a 1964 model, but the car was a 1968. If Carol relied on the image, that would mean that the image is the basis for her decision. But the contract's language doesn't mention reliance on images. So, the seller isn't at fault for that. So, option I is incorrect.

J: Carol, because the seller provided a picture of the car, regardless of its condition.

Wait, the contract says it's "used and sold as is," so the seller is responsible for the actual condition. The image in the ad doesn't affect the contract. So, even if the seller provided a picture, if the car is "as is," the image's content is irrelevant. So, J is incorrect.

So, the likely correct answer is G: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.

Wait, but the question is about whether the contract's "as is" clause is breached. The contract says the car is "used and sold as is," which means the seller has a duty to deliver it as it is. If the seller didn't change the car (and the contract doesn't require that), then the contract is not breached. So, the seller isn't liable for the condition of the car because the contract doesn't require that.

Wait, but the "as is" clause would require the seller to deliver the car in its actual state. So, if the contract says "as is," the seller can't be liable for the car's condition as depicted in the ad. Therefore, the fact that the ad showed a different model doesn't make the seller liable because the contract doesn't require that.

So, the correct reasoning is that the seller isn't at fault for the condition of the car because the contract's "used and sold as is" doesn't specify that the car must be delivered in actual condition.

Looking back at the options:

G: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.

Wait, the contract doesn't require the seller to consider the model's value. So, the seller isn't liable for the model's value. Therefore, the outcome is Carol doesn't have to prove the models are equal in value.

So, the situation is that the contract didn't require the seller to be aware of the car's value, so Carol can't rely on the model's value to prove the contract was breached. Therefore, the likely outcome is Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model is of equal value.

Wait, but isn't the contract's language that the model is "used and sold as is." So, if the seller can't prove that the 1968 model is of equal value, then Carol can't sue. But if the seller can prove the 1968 model is of equal value, then the contract is breached, and Carol is liable.

So, the question is what's the outcome. Carol's situation is that she's suing against the seller, and the options are about the likely outcome. So, the likely outcome depends on whether the seller can prove the models are equal in value.

The answer is G: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.

But wait, the contract's language says "used and sold as is," which I think means that the seller is responsible for the actual condition, but not the value. So, the seller isn't liable for the value of the model.

Alternatively, maybe the contract's language implies that the car is to be sold in its actual condition, which may not necessarily mean the value is considered. So, perhaps the seller isn't liable for the value.

Wait, but in some cases, the contract's language can be such that the seller is expected to be aware of the value of the car. But that's not a standard in contract law. I think the "as is" clause refers to the condition, not the value.

So, the conclusion is that the seller isn't at fault for the condition of the car, so Carol can't rely on the condition. Therefore, the likely outcome is Carol, unless the seller can prove the models are of equal value.

So, the correct answer is G.

The key issue revolves around the contract's language, "used and sold as is," which specifies that the seller is responsible for delivering the car in its actual condition. The newspaper ad provided an image of a 1964 Thunderbird, but Carol later bought a 1968 model, which is not rare. The contract does not require the car to be in its actual condition, only that it is "used and sold as is." 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The contract does not require the image to be accurate; the condition of the car is what matters, not the image's depiction.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The contract does not imply negligence by the seller, as the language does not suggest any fault.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The "as is" clause does not require the car to be in its actual condition, so the image's condition does not affect liability.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The contract does not require the seller to be negligent, and there is no indication of a breach of reliance on the image.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The contract does not require the seller to be negligent based on the image's representation.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The contract does not require the buyer to be aware of the model's value; the seller's liability is based on condition, not value.
- **Option G**: Correct. Carol is likely to succeed unless the seller can prove the 1968 model is of equal value to the 1964 model. The contract's language does not require the seller to be aware of the model's value, so Carol cannot rely on the models' values.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The contract does not require the seller to be negligent regarding the image's accuracy.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. There is no indication the seller was negligent in not stating the car's actual model.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The contract does not require the seller to be negligent based on the image's content.

Thus, the outcome is that Carol is likely to succeed unless the seller can prove the 1968 model is of equal value to the 1964 model.
