Okay, I'm trying to figure out which molecules among CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^- have sp² hybridization around the central atom. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that hybridization refers to the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals. The type of hybridization depends on the number of regions of electron density around the central atom. Regions can be bonds (single, double, triple) or lone pairs.

Now, let's go molecule by molecule.

Starting with CO2. Carbon in CO2 is double-bonded to each oxygen. So that's two double bonds. Each double bond counts as one region (since each bond is one region). Wait, but for hybridization, we consider sigma and pi bonds. Carbon has four regions: two sigma bonds and two lone pairs? Wait, no, wait. In CO2, each O is bonded via a double bond to C. So C has two double bonds, which are regions. But wait, each double bond is one region, but each is a combination of sigma and pi. But in terms of hybridization, each double bond is one region. So two regions. But wait, for CO2, each C-O bond is a double bond, so C has two regions (two double bonds). So how many hybrid orbitals would that be? Two. So the hybridization would be sp. Because two regions. So in CO2, each carbon is sp hybridized. But wait, wait, no. Wait, each atom in CO2 has two regions (two double bonds are one region each?), or each bond is a region, regardless of being sigma or pi. So CO2's central carbon has two regions—so sp hybridization. So CO2 is sp. So in CO2, the central carbon is sp, not sp².

Wait, but wait, the question is about sp² hybridization. So CO2 would not exhibit sp². So which molecules do have sp²?

Next, CO3^2-. Carbon in this molecule is connected to three oxygens. Each O is double-bonded to C. So the central C has three double bonds, which are three regions. So three regions, so sp² hybridization. So in CO3^2- the central carbon is sp². So that's one example.

Now, NO2^-. Let's think about nitrosyl ion. The structure is that nitrogen is the central atom. It has two oxygen atoms double-bonded to it. So two double bonds—so two regions. Wait, but wait, nitrogen in nitrosyl ion has a double bond (each O is double bonded) so two regions. So two regions, so sp. But wait, another possibility is that the structure is different. Wait, maybe the structure in NO2^- is different. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the NO₂^- ion structure. Nitrogen is in the center, with two oxygen atoms double-bonded. So each double bond is a region. So two regions, so sp hybridization. So each N-O bond is a double bond. So nitrogen would have sp hybridization. So in NO2^-, each N is sp. So NO2^- does not have any sp² hybridization.

Wait, but wait, another thought. What if the structure is different? Like maybe each O is single bonded, and N has a lone pair? No, that doesn't make sense because oxygen's more electronegative and would prefer to have higher bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a resonance structure where N is in a different hybridization, but I don't think that's the case. So each N in NO2^- is sp hybridized.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: perhaps the structure is different. Suppose that in NO2^-, the central N has two double bonds (so two regions) and perhaps one lone pair? No, wait: the charge would need to balance. Let me think about the Lewis structure. Nitrogen has a valence of 5. It forms double bonds with each O. So two double bonds (so 4 electrons used, 1 left). So N has a lone pair. So the structure would be N with two double bonds and a lone pair. So regions: two double bonds (two regions) and the lone pair? Wait, no, the lone pair is not a region—it's a lone pair. Wait, no—regions are bonds (sigma) and lone pairs. So in NO2^-:

Nitrogen has two double bonds and a lone pair. So that's three regions (two double bonds count as two regions, but wait—each double bond is one region, so two regions from the bonds, and one lone pair is another region. So total three regions. So three regions would require sp² hybridization. Oh, wait, that's a different approach. Let me count:

Nitrogen has two double bonds (so two regions) and a lone pair (so another region). So three regions. So sp² hybridization.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So if that's the case, then the central N in NO2^- is sp². So CO2 and NO2^- have sp². But wait, wait, I thought earlier CO3^2- has sp². So that would be two molecules with sp²: CO2 and NO2^-.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine.

CO2: each C has two double bonds (each is a region). So two regions. sp hybridization.

CO3^2-: the central C has three double bonds. So three regions. So sp² hybridization.

NO2^-: central N has two double bonds and a lone pair? Let me count the regions. Each double bond is a region, and the lone pair is another region. So two + one = three regions. So sp² hybridization. So in NO2^-, the N is sp².

Wait, but then that would mean CO2 and NO2^- have sp². But wait, what about the other options.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, perhaps the structure of NO2^- is different. Could it be that the central N has two double bonds but also a lone pair, making three regions? So sp².

So if that's correct, then CO2 and NO2^- would exhibit sp² hybridization.

Wait, but wait another thought: how about the nitrosyl ion (NO2^-). The structure is actually different. Let me think. In nitrosyl (NO2^-) ion, the central N has two double bonds and a lone pair? Or maybe a different arrangement.

Wait, the Lewis structure of NO2^- can be depicted as N with two double bonds to O and a lone pair. So that's two double bonds (two regions) and a lone pair (third region). So three regions—so sp².

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is that N has two single bonds, and two double bonds? No, that would require more electrons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is N with a double bond to each O, using four electrons in the bonds, leaving one lone pair. So two double bonds (two regions) and a lone pair (third region) → three regions → sp².

So in that case, the central N is sp².

So which molecules have sp²? CO2 (sp), CO3^2- (sp²), NO2^- (sp²). So that's two molecules (CO2 and NO2^-).

Wait, but the question is, which molecules exhibit sp² hybridization. So looking at the options, the possible correct answers are options that include CO2 and either NO2^- or NO3^-.

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each molecule.

CO2: each C has two double bonds. Two regions (each double bond is a region). So sp.

CO3^2-: central C with three double bonds. Three regions. So sp².

NO2^-: central N with two double bonds and a lone pair. Three regions → sp².

NO3^-: Let's think about that. The central N has three oxygen atoms. Each O is double bonded, but wait, maybe it's a different arrangement.

Wait, the structure of NO3^-: The central N is connected to three O. The charge is -1. Let's see.

Nitrogen has a valence of 5. In NO3^-, the N is in the center. Each O is double bonded (so each contributes two electrons to the bond). So three double bonds would be 3 × 2 = 6 electrons. But wait, that's 6, but N has 5 valence electrons. Let me calculate.

Wait, the formula for NO3^-: each O is double bonded. So N has two double bonds and one single bond? Or perhaps all three are double bonds? Wait, but that would require more electrons than N has.

Wait, perhaps the structure is that N is connected via single bonds to all three O. Let me count. If N is connected via single bonds, each O has two lone pairs, but that may not fit the charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is N with two double bonds and one lone pair. Wait, but that would be three regions, leading to sp².

Wait, let me think about the Lewis structure. In NO3^-, the central N has three oxygen atoms. The charge is -1.

So, N's valence is 5. Each O has 6 electrons (since O is 6). So the total valence electrons are: N(5) + 3*(O's 6) = 5 + 18 = 23? Wait, but wait, the overall charge is -1, so the total electrons are 23 +1=24.

Now, the structure is: N forms bonds with the three O atoms. Let's say each O is double bonded. So each double bond uses 4 electrons (each O contributes two). Three double bonds would be 3×4=12 electrons. N would have 2 electrons left. So N would have a lone pair of two electrons.

Wait, but N has 5 valence electrons. So if it forms three double bonds, that's 6 electrons used (3×2 each). Then, N has 5-6= -1? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each O is single bonded, and N has a lone pair.

Wait, let me try that: each O is single bonded (2 electrons each), so 3×2=6. N has 5 valence electrons. So 6+5=11 electrons, plus the charge (-1), so total electrons would be 11 +1=12? That's 12 electrons.

Wait, no. Let me recount. The structure is:

Each O is single bonded to N. So that's 3×2=6 electrons. N has 5 valence electrons. But wait, each bond is shared, so N contributes one electron to the bond. So, the N would have 5 -3 (since each bond takes one from N) = 2 electrons left, which is a lone pair. So N has two lone electrons (a pair).

So the structure would be N with three single bonds to O, and a lone pair. So the N has three regions: three bonds (sigma) and a lone pair. So four regions? Wait, no. Wait, the regions are the bonds (each is a region) plus lone pairs? Or do lone pairs count as regions?

Wait, no. Regions are sigma and lone pairs. So in this case, the lone pair is a region. So N has four regions: three sigma bonds and one lone pair. So four regions, so sp³ hybridization. So N would be sp³ hybridized.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Let me think again. Another approach: N must have a certain number of regions. Let's think about the structure of NO3^-:

Nitrogen is the central atom. It's bonded to three O atoms. Let me try to count the bonds. If all three O are single bonded, nitrogen would have 3 bonds (each single bond is one region). But that would be three regions. Then, is there a lone pair on N? Let me see.

The total number of valence electrons in the molecule: N(5) + 3*(O's 6) = 5+18=23. Add the charge of -1 → 24 electrons.

When forming bonds: each single bond uses 2 electrons (one from each atom). So for three single bonds, that's 3×2=6 electrons used. That leaves 24-6=18. But N has 5 valence electrons, O has 6 each. So 3×6 (O's) is 18. So after bonding, N contributes 5-3=2 electrons (a lone pair). So the total electrons are 2 (left on N) + 3×2=6 (bonds) → 8. But the molecule has 24 electrons. Hmm, that doesn't add up. I must have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: perhaps the structure is different. Maybe N is double-bonded to all three O, but that would require 3×4=12 electrons, leaving N with 5-12= -7, which is impossible. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the structure is that N is double-bonded to two O atoms and single-bonded to the third, but that would use 2×4 + 2=10 electrons. That's 10 used, leaving N with 5-10= -5. That's also impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the Lewis structure. In NO3^-:

The central N should have as many bonds as possible to get the structure right. Let's see. Nitrogen can have a maximum of 8 electrons. So each bond is two electrons. So for the molecule, the total electrons should be 24 (as N(5) + 3×O(6) + 1(-1) = 5+18+1=24).

Each single bond is two electrons. Let's consider N having three single bonds (each O gets one electron). So three bonds use 6 electrons. That leaves 24-6=18 electrons. Each O has 6, so 3×6=18. So no electrons left for lone pairs. So the structure would be N with three single bonds to O, each O with 3 lone pairs. So N is bonded via three single bonds. So four regions: three bonds (regions) and a lone pair (another region). So four regions → sp³ hybridization.

Wait, but that would mean N is sp³. So that's different. Then, in this structure, the central N is sp³ hybridized.

Alternatively, perhaps N is double-bonded to two O atoms and single-bonded to one. Let's compute: two double bonds (4 electrons), one single bond (2 electrons). So 4+2=6 used. Remaining 24-6=18. Each O has 6, so 3×6=18. So no lone pairs. So structure would have N with two double bonds (two regions) and one single bond (third region), plus any lone pairs. Wait, but all O's have 6 electrons each. So in this case, N would have three regions: two double bonds and one single bond. So three regions → sp² hybridization.

Wait, but that would mean N is sp². So in NO3^-, there are two double bonds and one single bond. So two regions from the double bonds and one region from the single bond. So three regions → sp². So N is sp² hybridized.

So in that structure, the central N is sp². Now, what about the O atoms?

Each O is single bonded to N and has lone pairs. Let me count the regions for O. Each O is bonded via one sigma bond and has three lone pairs (6 electrons). So each O is a region. But wait, wait: each O has a bond (so one region) and three lone pairs. But regions are sigma and lone pairs. So each O has four regions (one sigma, three lone pairs). So four regions → sp³ hybridization.

Wait, but in this case, the central N is sp², and the O's are sp³. So the question is about the hybridization of the central atoms. So in NO3^-, the central N is sp². So this molecule will exhibit sp² hybridization.

So in the options, which have sp²:

- CO2: sp
- CO3^2-: sp²
- NO2^-: sp²
- NO3^-: sp²?

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought NO3^- has N in sp². So the molecules that have sp² are CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-? Or am I getting this wrong.

Wait, let me reevaluate:

- CO2: each C has two double bonds → two regions → sp.

- CO3^2-: each C has three double bonds → three regions → sp².

- NO2^-: N has two double bonds and a lone pair → three regions → sp².

- NO3^-: N has three regions? Let me recheck. The structure I'm considering is N with two double bonds and one single bond. So two double bonds (each is a region) and one single bond (third region) → three regions → sp².

So for NO3^-, the central N is sp². So the molecule has sp² hybridization.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me think about the overall structure again. For NO3^-, perhaps the central N is bonded via three double bonds? No, that's impossible because that would require 3×2=6 electrons from N, which can only have five. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has N with two double bonds and two lone pairs. But that would mean four regions, so sp³, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the regions for NO3^-.

Wait, in the structure where N is connected via three single bonds (N-O), and a lone pair. So N has four regions: three single bonds (regions) and one lone pair (another region). So four regions → sp³ hybridization. So N would be sp³, not sp².

But earlier, I thought that maybe N is in a different hybridization. Let me think again: the central N is bonded via three single bonds to O, and has a lone pair. So N has four regions → sp³. So in that case, the molecule's central atom is sp³, not sp².

But then, earlier when I considered the structure with two double bonds and one single bond, I might have made a mistake in counting the regions. Let me recalculate.

If the structure is N with two double bonds and one lone pair:

- Each double bond is a region. So two regions.

- The lone pair is another region.

So three regions → sp² hybridization.

So in this structure, the central N is sp².

But that's only possible if the structure is correct. So perhaps the correct structure is that N has two double bonds and a lone pair. But that would require N to have 6 electrons (two double bonds, 4) plus a lone pair (2) → 6. But N has 5 valence electrons. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the structure is that N has two double bonds and a lone pair, but that would require N to have a total of 6 electrons (two from each double bond, one lone pair) but N has 5, so that's impossible. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that N has two double bonds and a single bond. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is N with two double bonds and a lone pair, which would require N to have 6 electrons (two from each double bond, one lone pair). But N has five valence electrons. So that's impossible. So that structure isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that N has one double bond and other bonds. Let me calculate.

If N has one double bond, then:

Double bond uses 4 electrons. N has 5, so 5-4 =1. So N has one lone pair. So structure is N with one double bond (region) and one lone pair (region). So two regions → sp hybridization.

So in this structure, the central N is sp. So if that's the case, then in NO3^-, the central N is sp, and the O's are in lone pairs.

So for NO3^-, the structure would be N with one double bond and a lone pair, and three single bonds to O. So N has four regions → sp³.

Wait, but that would mean the central N is sp³. So in that case, the molecule would have sp³ hybridization around the central N.

But earlier, I thought about a structure where N has three regions (two double bonds and a lone pair), which would be sp². But that's impossible because N can't have more than one lone pair. Wait, but 2 lone pairs would be 4 electrons, but N only has 5. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the Lewis structure again.

NO3^-:

Central N, bonded to three O atoms. The charge is -1.

Let me calculate the number of electrons:

N: 5
Each O: 6 → 3×6 =18
Charge: -1 → +1 (so 18 +1=19)

Total electrons: 5 + 18 +1 =24.

Now, the structure must account for 24 electrons.

Each bond is 2 electrons.

Let me think about the number of bonds. Let's say N forms three single bonds with O, using 3×2=6 electrons. That leaves 24-6=18 electrons. O has 6 each, so 3×6=18. So that would leave no lone pairs. So structure would be N-O-O-O-O, each O single bonded, and N with no lone pairs.

In this case, N has three regions (three single bonds) → sp³ hybridization.

So the central N is sp³, and the O's are in lone pairs.

Wait, but how about the charge? So N has 5 valence electrons. If it forms three single bonds, each bond takes one electron from N, so N contributes 5-3=2 electrons as a lone pair. So O's each have 6 (3 O's) → 18 electrons. So the total electrons are 3 (bonds) ×2 + 5 (N's lone pair) +18 (O's) = 2+5+18=25. But the molecule has 24. So this is impossible.

Ah, I see. So that approach doesn't work. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative approach: let me count the bonds from N.

Each bond is 2 electrons. Let me let the number of bonds be 'b'. So N has 'b' bonds, each using 2 electrons. The number of bonds can't exceed N's valence electrons (5).

So the total electrons from bonds is 2×b.

The total electrons from O's is 3×6 =18.

The total electrons is 18 (O) + 2b (bonds) + 5 (N's lone pair) = 23 + 2b.

But the molecule has 24 electrons. So 23 + 2b =24 → 2b=1 → b=0.5.

But that's impossible. So this approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps the structure is that N is double-bonded to two O atoms and single-bonded to one O. Let's see.

Each double bond is 4 electrons, so 2×4=8. The single bond is 2 electrons. So 8 + 2 =10. So 24 -10 =14 electrons left. But O's are 6 each, so 3×6=18. So 14 <18. So this approach isn't working.

Alternative approach: let me think about the number of bonds. N must have at least one bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that N forms three double bonds with O, but that's impossible because N can't form more than two double bonds (as that would require more than 5 electrons).

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that N is double-bonded to one O and single-bonded to two O's. Let me see.

Each double bond is 4 electrons, so 4. Each single bond is 2, so 4. Total bonds: 4 (double) + 2 (single) =6. So 6×2=12 electrons. So 12 used, 24-12=12 left. O's have 3×6=18. So 12 <18. That's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach: let me count the regions.

In NO3^-, the central N has three O atoms. Let's think about how the structure is.

Assuming that N is double-bonded to two O atoms and single-bonded to one O, but that would require:

Each double bond is 4 electrons. So 2×4=8. Single bond: 2. Total bonds:8 +2=10. So 10 electrons used. Remaining:24-10=14. O's have 3×6=18. So 14 <18. Not possible.

Alternative approach: perhaps the structure is that N is single-bonded to all three O's. So three single bonds (3×2=6). Then, N has 5 valence electrons. So 5-3=2 electrons left as a lone pair. So structure would have N with three single bonds and a lone pair. So four regions → sp³ hybridization.

But in that case, the O's are single-bonded and have lone pairs. But the central N is sp³.

So in that structure, the molecule's central N is sp³, and the O's are in lone pairs.

So for NO3^-, the central N is sp³. So, in terms of hybridization, the N is sp³, not sp².

So in the options, which have sp² hybridization around the central atom?

Looking back:

- CO2: sp
- CO3^2-: sp²
- NO2^-: sp²
- NO3^-: sp³

Wait, but I thought NO3^- has N in sp². But according to my earlier analysis, it's sp³.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the structure might be N with two double bonds and a lone pair, leading to three regions → sp². But that's impossible because N can't have four regions.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is N with two double bonds and a lone pair, which would require:

Each double bond is 4, so 2×4=8. Plus the lone pair (2), total 10. So 10 used, 24-10=14 left. O's have 18, so 14<18 → impossible. So that structure isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is N with three regions: two double bonds and one lone pair. So sp².

Wait, but how? Because two double bonds would require four electrons, but N has only five. So that's impossible.

So I'm back to square one. Let me try to think of it differently.

In the structure of NO3^-, the central N is connected via three sigma bonds to the three O atoms, and has a lone pair. So the regions are three sigma bonds and a lone pair. So four regions → sp³ hybridization.

So the central N is sp³. So in that case, the molecule would have sp³ hybridization around the central N.

So the options that have sp² hybridization around the central atom would be CO2, CO3^2-, and NO2^-.

Wait, but wait. CO3^2- has the central C in sp² hybridization, as we discussed earlier. So the molecule's central C is sp².

So the molecule would exhibit sp² hybridization around the central C.

So among the options:

A: CO2 → sp
B: CO3^2- → sp²
C: NO2^- → sp²
D: NO3^- → sp²? Or sp³?

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests that NO3^- has the central N in sp³. So the molecule would have sp³ hybridization around the central N.

So the molecule would not exhibit sp² hybridization around the central N.

So the options where the central atom is sp² would be B, C, and any others.

So the question is, which of the options have the central atom in sp².

Looking back:

The options are:

A: CO2 → sp

B: CO3^2- → sp²

C: NO2^- → sp²

D: NO3^- → sp³

So, the molecules that have sp² hybridization around the central atom are B, C, and any others if they have that.

Wait, but wait another thought: in NO3^-, the central N is sp³. So the molecule does not exhibit sp² hybridization around the central N.

So only the molecules where the central atom is sp² would have that hybridization.

In the options, B, C, and perhaps others (if any) would have sp².

So, in the options, the correct answer would be B, C, and any others that have sp².

But looking at the options given, the question is which option or options have sp² hybridization.

So the correct answer would be options B, C, and any other that have the central atom in sp².

Wait, but the question is which of the following options has sp² hybridization around the central atom.

Looking at the options:

A: CO2 → sp (so no)

B: CO3^2- → sp² (so yes)

C: NO2^- → sp² (so yes)

D: NO3^- → sp³ or sp²?

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested NO3^- has N in sp³, so option D's central N is sp³.

So the correct answer would be options B, C, and any others where the central atom is sp².

But the options given are:

A: CO2 → sp

B: CO3^2- → sp²

C: NO2^- → sp²

D: NO3^- → sp³

So the molecules where the central atom is sp² are B and C.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought that NO3^- could have the central N in sp², but that's impossible because N can't have four regions (two double bonds and a lone pair).

Wait, but if the structure were such that N has two double bonds and a lone pair, that would require N to have 6 electrons, which it doesn't. So that's impossible.

Thus, the correct structure would be that N has three sigma bonds and a lone pair, which is four regions → sp³.

So the central N is sp³.

So the molecule would have sp³ hybridization around N.

Therefore, the correct options are those where the central atom is sp².

Looking at the options, B and C have sp².

Wait, but let me see if any other options have sp².

No. So the answer is options B and C.

Wait, but looking back in the question, the user provided a multiple-choice question with options A-D, and the question is to select the correct option.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The options are:

A: CO2 → sp

B: CO3^2- → sp²

C: NO2^- → sp²

D: NO3^- → sp²?

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that NO3^- has N in sp³, so the molecule would have sp³ hybridization around N.

So the molecule D would not exhibit sp² hybridization around the central atom.

So the correct answer is B and C, which have sp² hybridization.

But wait, the question is which option or options have sp² hybridization.

Looking at the options:

Which of the following options is correct?

The options are:

A: CO2 → sp

B: CO3^2- → sp²

C: NO2^- → sp²

D: NO3^- → sp³

So the correct options are B and C.

But the question says "which of the following options" has sp².

But the options are presented as separate choices.

Wait, the question is in the form of a multiple-choice question, and the options are:

A: CO2 → sp

B: CO3^2- → sp²

C: NO2^- → sp²

D: NO3^- → sp³

So the correct answer would be options B and C.

But in the given options, the user provided the options as separate choices, and the correct answer in the options would be B and C.

But the user's question says "which of the following options" but in the actual problem, the options are given as A to D, each with a description.

So if the question is to select all options that have sp² hybridization, then the correct options would be B and C.

But the way the question is phrased, it's a single-answer question, so perhaps the answer is B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the structure of NO3^-.

In the structure where N has two double bonds and a lone pair, that's impossible because N only has five valence electrons.

So another approach: perhaps the structure is N with three regions: two double bonds and one sigma bond.

Wait, but that would require N to have two double bonds and one sigma bond, which would be 4 + 2 = 6 electrons. But N has only five, so impossible.

So that's not possible.

Thus, perhaps the correct structure is that N has three sigma bonds and no lone pairs, but that's impossible because the molecule would have 18 electrons (3 O's × 6) plus 5 (N) plus 0 lone pairs → 23 electrons, but the molecule has 24.

Wait, that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is that N has two sigma bonds and one lone pair, and one sigma bond with an additional electron from elsewhere.

Wait, but that's getting too complicated.

Perhaps I should give up and look for the answer elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B and C.

But in the options given, the correct answer would be B and C.

But according to the initial analysis, CO2 is sp, CO3^2- is sp², NO2^- is sp², NO3^- is sp³.

So the correct options are B and C.

So the answer would be options B and C.

But the user's question is presented as a multiple-choice question, with options A to D, each with a description.

So the correct answer is options B and C, which would be letters B and C.

But the way the options are presented, perhaps the correct answer is B and C.

But the user's question is "Which of the following options..." So the answer is the combination of B and C.

But the way the options are given, the letters are separate, so the correct options are B and C.

But perhaps the question is in the form of a true/false question, but no, it's about hybridization.

Thus, the correct answer is B and C.

The correct answer is **B and C**. 

### Analysis:
1. **CO₂ (Option A)**: The central carbon (C) has two double bonds, resulting in sp² hybridization.  
2. **CO₃²⁻ (Option B)**: The central carbon (C) has three sigma bonds and one lone pair, resulting in sp² hybridization.  
3. **NO₂⁻ (Option C)**: The central nitrogen (N) has two double bonds and a lone pair, resulting in sp² hybridization.  
4. **NO₃⁻ (Option D)**: The central nitrogen (N) has two double bonds and one lone pair, which is impossible because nitrogen only has five valence electrons. This results in sp³ hybridization.  

Thus, the molecules that exhibit sp² hybridization around the central atom are **B and C**.
