Okay, so I've got this question about the basilar membrane and how waves reach their peak based on the frequency of a tone. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the basilar membrane is a part of the inner ear responsible for hearing sound. It's involved in processing different frequencies and their responses. I think it's related to how the ear works with the inner ear muscles, like the ossicles and bivalents.

The question is asking about which theory explains where the waves reach their peak on the basilar membrane. The options include frequency theory, dual-process theory, specificity theory, and others.

I recall that the basilar membrane is sensitive to different frequencies. Lower frequencies are heard in the outer ear, while higher frequencies are picked up by the basilar membrane. I think this is part of the dual-process theory, which includes the place cells and the system of outer and inner ear sensory organs. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct term.

Wait, another angle: the basilar membrane's response to frequency is called the basilar memory area. And I remember something about the place cells and the system being part of place theory, but that's more about where responses are, not the timing.

Wait, no, another approach. The basilar membrane is sensitive to higher frequencies and their responses are processed by the basilar part. I think the idea is that higher frequencies are processed by the basilar membrane, which responds to them in a specific frequency band. So for example, the basilar membrane is most sensitive to frequencies above 1 kHz, around 500-1000 Hz.

So the theory that explains the frequency-dependent response of the basilar membrane is probably about how the response varies with frequency. This would be part of the dual-process theory, which deals with the two systems that process information: the outer and inner ear.

Wait, another point: I remember that the basilar membrane's response to higher frequencies is more pronounced than lower ones. So when a higher frequency sound arrives, the basilar membrane reacts more strongly. So the peak response on the basilar membrane depends on the frequency, and the theory explaining this is probably the dual-process theory.

Looking at the options, option B is dual-process theory. Another thought: I also remember something about place cells and the system of the outer and inner ear being part of the place theory, but that's about where the responses are, not the timing.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the position where the waves peak, i.e., the response location on the basilar membrane. So it's about the frequency-dependent response. That would tie into the dual-process theory, which includes the place cells (outer and inner ear) and the system of sensory organs.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with place theory, but I think place theory is about the response patterns in the basilar membrane. So I'm a bit torn between B and I (which is place theory). Wait, no, the basilar membrane's response is part of the place theory, not the system of outer and inner ear.

Wait, another angle: the basilar membrane is part of the place system, which includes the outer and inner ear sensory organs. So the place cells and the various systems are part of the place theory. So the theory that explains this is the place theory, which is option I.

Wait, but the question is about the position of the waves. So waves reaching their peak on the basilar membrane. The theory that explains the latencies and the frequency dependence is the place theory, which includes the basilar memory area and the system of outer and inner ear sensory organs.

So the correct theory would be the place theory, which is option I.

Wait, but the options don't have I as the answer. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: frequency theory

B: dual-process theory

C: specificity theory

D: trichromatic

E: gestalt theory

F: volley

G: signal detection theory

H: opponent-process

I: place

J: sensory adaptation theory

So option I is "place". So the correct answer should be I, meaning the basilar membrane's response is due to the place system.

Wait, but the question says "the position on the basilar membrane at which waves reach their peak depends on the frequency of a tone according to which theory?" So the theory is about where the waves peak, which is the place theory. Hence, the answer is I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought of dual-process theory. Let me clarify.

Dual-process theory is about the two systems: the sensory organs (outer ear) and the place cells (basilar membrane). The system of outer and inner ear sensory organs is part of dual-process theory. So the theory that explains the basilar membrane's frequency-dependent response is the system of outer and inner ear sensory organs, which is part of dual-process theory.

Wait, but the question is about the position on the basilar membrane. So which theory explains that the waves reach their peak at a specific frequency spot? That seems to tie into place theory, which is the system of outer and inner ear sensory organs.

So the correct answer would be I: place.
</think>

The basilar membrane's response to different frequencies is influenced by the frequency-dependent sensitivity, where higher frequencies are processed by the basilar membrane. This phenomenon is explained by the theory that describes the system of outer and inner ear sensory organs, which includes the basilar membrane as part of this system. The correct answer is:
