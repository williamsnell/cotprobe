Question:

A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.
B: inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.
C: admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.
D: admissible, because the original contract was lost.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about contracts and evidence. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a buyer suing a seller for opening a hot dog stand. The contract was supposed to be executed by the seller, but the original was lost. The buyer wants to bring a duplicate of the contract to prove their case. The seller objects that the contract's authenticity was contestable.

Hmm. I remember that contracts need to be valid and binding. But if the contract is lost, can you prove its authenticity? Oh wait, the question says that the contract was supposed to be in a contract, but it's lost. So the seller is trying to get a duplicate for evidence.

In evidence law, duplicate contracts can be admitted. The idea is that if the original is lost, a copy can be used as evidence. But wait, there are some rules about evidence. The best evidence rule comes into play here. The best evidence rule states that evidence must be produced in the original form, unless a copy is made. Because the original might be damaged or destroyed.

Wait, but the question says the contract was lost. So the original is not around anymore. So the seller might be arguing that the original is invalid because it's lost. But what about the duplicate?

Oh, right, the duplicate can be used as evidence, even if the original is lost. The original contract's authenticity is important, but the duplicate can be a substitute. Unless the original itself is untraceable or unrecorded. But in this case, the question says the contract was lost, but it's still in the seller's possession. So the seller could produce a copy.

Wait, but the options are about the admissibility. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A says the duplicate is inadmissible because the seller contests the original's authenticity. But if the contract was lost but the seller has the contract itself, can they produce it as evidence? Or does the duplicate have to be authenticated.

Wait, no, the original contract's authenticity is a key point. If the contract was lost, can the original be used as evidence? Or does the duplicate become the only evidence?

Wait, the original contract was lost, so the seller can't use it. But if the contract is valid, then they can use it as evidence. Alternatively, a duplicate could be used as evidence regardless of the original's authenticity.

Wait, no. Because if the original contract is lost, and the seller has a copy, then the copy can be used as evidence. But the original's authenticity is a critical factor. The duplicate's authenticity is not the issue here. The duplicate is a substitute. Unless the original is completely untraceable.

Wait, but the question says the original contract was lost, but the seller has it. So the original's authenticity is a factor in whether it can be used as evidence. But the duplicate can be used as evidence regardless of the original's authenticity.

Wait, but the original contract's authenticity is a key point. If the original was lost, but the contract exists, can the seller use the contract's authenticity to prove the facts? Or does a duplicate need to be authenticated?

I think the original contract's authenticity is important. If the contract itself was lost, then the original cannot be used as evidence. But the seller can use a duplicate. Unless the original is entirely untraceable, but the question doesn't say that.

So the duplicate would be inadmissible if the original is untraceable, but the question states the contract was lost, so the original might be traceable. So the duplicate can be used as evidence of the contract's existence.

Wait, but the duplicate's authenticity is a separate issue. The seller's objection is about the contract's authenticity. But if a duplicate is presented, wouldn't that be inadmissible unless the original is untraceable? Or is the question about the duplicate's authenticity?

Wait, the question is about the seller objecting to the authenticity of the original contract. So maybe the duplicate is being used as evidence, but the original can't be used because it's lost. So the duplicate's authenticity is not the issue here. The issue is that the original is untraceable or invalid, affecting the case.

Wait, but the question is about proof of the contract's existence. The best evidence rule says that if you can't prove the original was valid, then you can use a copy. But the original is lost. So the best evidence rule would say that a copy can be used as evidence.

Alternatively, if the contract was lost, the original can't be used, but a copy can be. So the duplicate can be used.

Wait, but the issue is about the duplicate's authenticity. The seller is objecting to the original's authenticity. But the duplicate can be used as evidence regardless of the original's authenticity. So the duplicate would be inadmissible unless the original is untraceable.

Wait, but the question says the contract was lost, so the original is in the seller's possession. So the original's authenticity is a matter of fact that affects whether the contract can be used. But the duplicate can be used as evidence, regardless of the original's authenticity.

So the duplicate is admissible because it's a substitute, unless the original is untraceable.

But the options say that the duplicate is inadmissible because of the original's authenticity. Alternatively, the duplicate is allowed because the original was lost, so they can substitute.

In this case, the original contract's authenticity is a point. The duplicate would be inadmissible if the original was untraceable, but since the contract was lost, the original might be traceable. So the duplicate would be admissible.

Wait, but the original contract was lost. So the original contract's existence is an issue. If the contract was lost, the original can't be used as evidence. So the duplicate can be used as evidence of the contract's existence.

Wait, but the best evidence rule says that unless the original can't be shown, a copy can be used. So if the original is untraceable or invalid, the best evidence rule says the copy can't be used. But if the original is traceable, then the copy can be used.

In this scenario, the question doesn't say whether the original contract was valid or not. But the problem is about the duplicate's admissibility.

So, the duplicate can be inadmissible only if the original's authenticity is untraceable. But since the original was lost, perhaps it's traceable. So the duplicate is admissible.

Wait, but the options are about whether the duplicate is admissible.

Looking at the options:

A: inadmissible because seller contended the original's authenticity is untraceable. But the original was lost, so perhaps it's traceable.

B: inadmissible because the best evidence rule requires original evidence. But the best evidence rule suggests the duplicate can be used as evidence of the contract's existence if the original is untraceable. But if the original is traceable, the duplicate is inadmissible.

Wait, no. The best evidence rule is about evidence types, not the authenticity of the contract. So, in this case, the best evidence rule might not prevent the duplicate from being inadmissible. Unless the original is untraceable.

Actually, the best evidence rule is about what evidence you have. If you can't prove the original exists, you can use a copy. But if the original is untraceable, you can't use a copy because you can't verify it's valid.

But in this case, the contract was lost. So the original contract might not be entirely untraceable. So a copy can be used as evidence.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the law.

In the case of a lost contract, the best evidence rule says that a substitute can be used as evidence unless the original can't be proved. So if the original is untraceable, the best evidence rule would say the substitute can't be used. But if the original is traceable, you can use the substitute.

In this question, the contract was lost, so the original might not be untraceable. So the duplicate can be used as evidence.

Therefore, the duplicate is admissible because the original was lost (so the original might be traceable), thus the duplicate can be used. So the correct choice would be option C: admissible, because it's a duplicate.

Wait, but what about the original's authenticity? The seller is objecting on that. But the duplicate is a substitute, so the original's authenticity doesn't affect the admissibility of the duplicate. So the duplicate is admissible regardless.

Wait, no. The duplicate is inadmissible if the original is untraceable. So the question is about whether the original was untraceable. If the original was lost, perhaps it's considered traceable, so the duplicate is admissible.

Alternatively, if the original contract was untraceable, the duplicate can't be used. But the question doesn't indicate that. So the duplicate can be used as the substitute.

So the correct answer would be option C: admissible because the duplicate is a carbon copy.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the duplicate is admissible because it's a carbon copy. That makes sense.

Another option is D: admissible because the original was lost. So the original contract was lost, so the original can't be used. But the duplicate can be.

Wait, but the original's authenticity is a factor. So if the original was untraceable, the duplicate can't be used. But since the contract was lost, maybe the original isn't untraceable. So the duplicate is admissible.

So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around determining whether a duplicate contract can be admissible as evidence under the circumstances described. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Key Issues**:  
   - The original contract was lost, so its authenticity is a point of consideration.  
   - The seller objects to the authenticity of the original contract, but a duplicate could be used as evidence.  
   - The best evidence rule states that a substitute (like a duplicate) can be used as evidence unless the original is untraceable.  

2. **Analysis**:  
   - If the original contract was untraceable, the best evidence rule would make the duplicate inadmissible. However, since the contract was "lost," it's reasonable to assume the original is traceable, meaning the duplicate can be used as evidence.  
   - The duplicate's authenticity is not the issue here; its admissibility depends on the traceability of the original.  

3. **Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **A**: Incorrect. The duplicate is not inadmissible because the original's authenticity is not the issue.  
   - **B**: Incorrect. The best evidence rule allows the use of a substitute unless the original is untraceable, which is unlikely given the contract's loss.  
   - **C**: Correct. The duplicate is admissible because it is a substitute, and the original's authenticity is a matter of fact affecting the case, not the admissibility of the duplicate.  
   - **D**: Incorrect. The original contract being lost is not the sole reason for the duplicate's admissibility; the original's traceability is a factor.  

The correct answer is **C**, as the duplicate can be used as evidence under the principles of the best evidence rule.
