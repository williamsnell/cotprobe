Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the percentage of Germans who believe the U.S. and Germany have a good relationship. Let me think through this.

The question is from 2019, so I should remember any recent data. I'm not sure about exact figures, but I can recall that in 2019, Germany's economy was doing well. I remember reading that people often talk about the U.S. being a major power, so that's a positive sign. 

Looking at the options, A is 34%, which seems low. B is 85%, which is pretty high. C is 64%, D is 25%, E is 55%, F is 70%, G is 79%, H is 90%, I is 49%, J is 15%. 

I think the majority of Germans would agree that the U.S. is a major power. From what I remember, in 2019, the majority of Germans believed the U.S. was a major power and that the U.S. would be a major power in the future. So the percentage should be high. 

Option B is 85%, which is high. Option F is 70%, which is also high but maybe a bit lower than 85%. I'm not sure about the exact percentage. I think I've heard that Germany's opinion is that the U.S. is a major power. So, maybe the majority, like 80% or more. I'm a bit torn between B and F. 

Wait, another angle: I've heard that the majority of Germans think the U.S. is a major power. So, the percentage should be around 80-90%, which would make B (85%) and F (70%) both plausible. But looking at other data, maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, I also remember that in 2019, Germany's public opinion was positive, so maybe 85% is the correct figure. 

Alternatively, another approach: think about the phrasing of the question. It's about the relationship being "good." So, people might not agree, but if they do, it's a positive sign. So, a high percentage is likely. 

I think the correct answer is B: 85%. That's the highest option and aligns with the general sentiment that the U.S. is a major power.

The correct answer is B: 85%. This reflects the high percentage of Germans who believe the U.S. is a major power, aligning with the positive perception in 2019.

Answer: B
