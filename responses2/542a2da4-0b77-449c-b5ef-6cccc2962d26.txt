Question:

The marketing research firm of Burrows, Heller and Larimer wants to estimate the proportions of men and women who are familiar with a shoe polish. In a sample (random) of 100 men and 200 women it is found that 20 men and 60 women had used this particular shoe polish. Compute a 95% confidence interval for the difference in pro portions between men and women familiar with the product. Use this to test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal.

Options:

A: The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no difference in proportions
B: The proportions are equal
C: The proportions are not equal
D: The confidence interval does not include zero, indicating a significant difference in proportions
E: The proportion of women is higher
F: The confidence interval is too wide to determine a significant difference
G: The proportion of men is higher
H: No conclusion can be drawn without further data
I: The proportion of men is significantly lower
J: The proportion of women is significantly lower

Okay, so I have this statistics problem here about confidence intervals and a hypothesis test. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that when it comes to confidence intervals and proportions, it's all about estimating the difference between two populations. 

The question says that a marketing firm wants to estimate the proportions of men and women who are familiar with a shoe polish. They took a sample of 100 men and 200 women. Out of these, 20 men and 60 women had used the product. I need to compute a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions and then see if the proportions are equal. 

First, let me break down the given data. For men, the sample size is 100, and x_men is 20. For women, it's 200 and x_women is 60. So, the sample proportions would be p_men = 20/100 = 0.2 and p_women = 60/200 = 0.3. 

The difference in proportions is p_men - p_women = 0.2 - 0.3 = -0.1. So, the point estimate is -0.1. But we need the confidence interval for this difference.

I remember that the formula for the confidence interval for the difference in proportions is:

(p1 - p2) ± z*(sqrt( (p1(1-p1)/n1) + (p2(1-p2)/n2) )) 

Where p1 and p2 are the sample proportions, n1 and n2 are the sample sizes, and z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is around 1.96.

So plugging in the numbers:

p1 = 0.2, p2=0.3, n1=100, n2=200.

First, compute the standard error (SE):

SE = sqrt( (0.2*(1-0.2)/100) + (0.3*(1-0.3)/200) )

Calculate each term inside the square root:

For men: 0.2*0.8 / 100 = 0.16/100 = 0.0016
For women: 0.3*0.7 / 200 = 0.21/200 = 0.00105
Add them: 0.0016 + 0.00105 = 0.00265

Take the square root: sqrt(0.00265) ≈ 0.0515.

So the standard error is approximately 0.0515. 

Then, the margin of error (ME) is z * SE. z is 1.96, so:

ME = 1.96 * 0.0515 ≈ 0.101.

So the confidence interval is:

-0.1 ± 0.101. That gives us a lower bound of -0.201 and an upper bound of 0.099.

So the 95% CI is approximately (-0.201, 0.099). 

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations because sometimes I confuse the formula. Oh wait, I think I did it right. 

Now, the confidence interval includes zero because the lower bound is negative and the upper is positive. So the possible difference between the two proportions is such that zero is in the interval. That means we can't be sure whether the difference is positive or negative. 

Wait, but let me think about the wording of the question. It asks to compute the 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions and then use it to test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal. 

The null hypothesis here is that p_men = p_women, so the difference is zero. If the confidence interval includes zero, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. So in this case, the interval is (-0.201, 0.099), which includes zero. So the conclusion is that we don't have enough evidence to say that the proportions are different.

Looking at the options, option A says the confidence interval includes zero, indicating no difference. Option D says the interval doesn't include zero, implying a significant difference. So option A is correct in that the CI includes zero, so the proportions are not significantly different.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no difference in proportions.
B: The proportions are equal.
C: The proportions are not equal.
D: The confidence interval does not include zero, indicating a significant difference.
E: The proportion of women is higher.
F: The confidence interval is too wide to determine a significant difference.
G: The proportion of men is higher.
H: No conclusion can be drawn without further data.
I: The proportion of men is significantly lower.
J: The proportion of women is significantly lower.

So the correct answer is option A, because the CI includes zero. But wait, wait another point. The alternative approach is to calculate the confidence interval and see if zero is in it. If it is, we don't reject the null.

Wait, but another way to think: if the interval includes zero, it means that the difference between the two proportions could be zero. So the proportions are not significantly different. So the conclusion is that there's no significant difference, which supports option A.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the SE.

Another approach: Let's recompute.

For men: 20/100 = 0.2. Variance is 0.2*0.8/100=0.16/100=0.0016.

For women: 60/200= 0.3. Variance is 0.3*0.7/200=0.21/200=0.00105.

Sum of variances: 0.0016 + 0.00105 = 0.00265.

SE is sqrt(0.00265) ≈ 0.0515.

MSE: 0.0515 * 1.96 ≈ 0.101.

So the CI is -0.1 ± 0.101 → -0.201 to 0.099.

Yes, correct. So the confidence interval includes zero.

So the answer would be option A: The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no difference in proportions.

Wait, but another thought: What's the purpose of the confidence interval? It's to estimate the range of values for the difference in proportions. If the interval includes zero, then we can't be certain that the difference is different. So the proportions are not significantly different. So the correct conclusion is that there's no significant difference between the proportions. So option A is correct.

The problem involves a marketing research firm estimating the difference in proportions of men and women familiar with a shoe polish. The sample data shows 20 out of 100 men (20%) and 60 out of 200 women (30%) using the product. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions is calculated as (-0.201, 0.099), which includes zero. Since zero is within the interval, the difference is not statistically significant. Thus, the correct conclusion is that there's no significant difference in the proportions.
