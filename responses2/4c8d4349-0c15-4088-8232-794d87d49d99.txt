The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A reading specialist in a large public school system believes that the more time students spend reading, the better they will do in school. She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design?

Options:

A: Yes, because the control group is necessary for comparison.
B: Yes.
C: No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.
D: No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.
E: No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.
F: No, because the experiment does not account for the varying reading levels of the students.
G: Yes, because the independent variable is manipulated by the researcher.
H: No, because the experimental design does not include a double-blind procedure.
I: Yes, because it tests the effect of different amounts of reading on GPA.
J: No, because the sample size of each group is not large enough.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether this experimental design is good or not. Let me read the question again. 

The specialist is testing whether more reading time improves school performance. She's splitting 30 8th graders into a group with extra reading, same for 30 7th graders, and 30 6th graders with no extra. Then comparing their GPAs after a year. 

Hmm, the options are about whether this is a good design. Let me think about the key aspects of experimental design. 

First, the control group is necessary. I remember that in experiments, especially experiments, having a control group helps to see if the changes are due to the treatment (extra reading) or other factors. So the sixth graders with no extra are the control. That's good. So option A says yes because the control is necessary. That sounds right.

Wait, but what's the question again? It's whether this design is good. So is the answer A? Or am I missing something?

Wait another point. The expert is assigning different amounts of extra reading. Oh, wait, no, she's assigning four, two, and zero hours. Wait, wait, but that's the same as 4, 2, and 0, which are different amounts. Hmm, but is the amount of reading variable here? Or is it fixed?

Wait, the question says she assigns four, two, and zero hours. That’s four, two, zero, so different amounts. But does that make sense? Because in an experiment, you don't necessarily assign different amounts unless that's the treatment. But in this case, the treatment is the amount of reading—so it's a variable. But wait, she's assigning different levels of reading, which might be a controlled variable. But perhaps the main variable is the reading time. So the main independent variable is the time, not the specific hours. Hmm, but the design is that each group is assigned a different number of hours. So the main variable is how much extra time they get.

Wait, but the key issue here is that the design may not account for other variables, like the grade level. The students are in different grades, which could be a confounding variable. Because 8th and 7th graders might have different academic backgrounds, and 6th graders might have different reading levels. So if the sixth graders are only 30, they might have different characteristics compared to the others. This would be a lurking variable, which is a variable that's not accounted for but affects the outcome.

Looking at the options, option D says: No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration. That sounds correct. So the design doesn't control for grade level, which is a factor that could influence the results.

Wait, but the question is about whether the design is good. So the issue is that the design may not account for other variables, making the results possibly due to these confounding factors.

So the options:

Option D: No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.

Wait, option G says: Yes, because the independent variable is manipulated by the researcher. But the independent variable is the amount of extra reading—four, two, zero. Wait, no, no, wait. The independent variable is whether they're in the control or the treatment group. Because the 8th graders get four, 7th get two, sixth get none. So the independent variable is which group they're in. So the researcher is manipulating the amount of extra reading, which is the independent variable. So G is correct if the independent variable is manipulated.

Wait, but in the design, the researcher is assigning fixed amounts of extra reading. So that's a controlled variable, not a random assignment. So the design is a completely randomized design, not a block design. So D is correct because the independent variable is the amount of extra reading (four, two, zero), which is being assigned. The fact that they're fixed amounts, not random, doesn't make it a problem. But the problem is that the independent variable is the amount of reading, and the "level" of the variable (like 4, 2, 0) is fixed, not randomly assigned.

Wait, but the key point about the design's lack of control for other variables is in option D. Because the group is split into different levels of extra reading, which is a form of blocking. However, the grades are a confounding variable. So the design doesn't control for it, making the results possibly confounded.

So the question is, is the design good? Well, the design is a valid experiment, but it's not controlling for a confounding variable. So the design is not good because it doesn't account for the possible confounded variable, grade level.

So among the options, option D says: No, because the experimental design does not account for a lurking variable (grade level) which may be confounded with the variables under consideration.

Wait, but what is the independent variable here? The independent variable is the level of extra reading—four, two, or zero. So the researcher is assigning specific levels. Therefore, the independent variable is the amount, not the specific hours. Wait no, the independent variable is whether the group has the extra reading or not, but the amount is fixed. So perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the independent variable in terms of what's being manipulated is the amount of extra reading. But in this case, the researcher is assigning fixed amounts. So the independent variable is the group (which group gets the extra reading). So the researcher is varying the amount of reading as part of the control or treatment, but the amounts are fixed. However, the main variable is whether they're in the treatment or control group.

So the key issue is the lack of controlling for a confounding variable—grade level. So option D is correct.

So the options:

A: yes because control is necessary.

D: no, because grade level is a confounding variable.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but what about the group sizes? The third group has 30 students. The other groups have 30 each. The sample size is large enough, so that's not an issue. So the problem is not about sample size.

Another point: The design includes different group sizes, but that doesn't make the design invalid. The main issue is the lack of controlling for the grade level variable.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The experimental design described involves assigning three groups different amounts of extra reading (four hours, two hours, and none) and comparing their GPAs. The control group is the sixth graders, who have no extra reading. The key issue here is whether this design adequately accounts for a lurking variable that may confound the results. 

Option D states that the design does not account for a lurking variable (grade level), which may confound the results with the variables under consideration. While the groups are of similar size, the lack of control for grade level, a possible confounding factor, makes the design flawed. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Answer: D
