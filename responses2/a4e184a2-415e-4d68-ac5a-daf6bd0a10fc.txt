Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Carr selling shares and calculating the New York State transfer tax. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says Mr. Carr sold 300 shares. The par value of each share is $50. Wait, par value is the amount usually written on the share certificate, right? So each share is worth $50. But when he sells it, he's probably selling it for more than that. The question is about calculating the transfer tax, which I think is the tax imposed on the sale of shares.

The problem gives different price ranges for the shares based on the par value. Let me go through them:

1. $0.01(1/4) per share: Wait, that's a strange way of writing it. Maybe it's $0.01 plus 1/4 of a dollar, which is $0.25. So each share is sold for $0.26? Or maybe it's a typo and it's $0.01 plus 1/4 of a dollar, so $0.25. Alternatively, maybe it's $0.01 plus 0.25, so $0.26. So the first option is $0.26 per share.

2. $0.50(1/2) per share: Similarly, this could mean $0.50 plus 1/2 of a dollar, which is $0.50 + $0.50 = $1.00 per share. So the price here is $1.00.

3. $0.75(3/4) per share: So 0.75 plus 0.75 is $1.50 per share.

4. $1.00 per share for over $20 par value. Oh wait, the last part says "for stocks over $20 a share par value." So the minimum par value here is $20, meaning the shares are sold for $1.00 each.

Wait, but wait, the par value is $50 for each share. So each share has a par value of $50. So the selling price depends on the range based on the par value. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, no, wait, the par value is fixed at $50 for each share. So the price per share depends on the selling price relative to the par value. So the price ranges are:

- For $5-$10 par value: How? No, wait, the par values given are for the shares, not the price. Wait, looking back at the problem: Oh, wait, the first line says, "Mr. Carr sold 300 shares of stock having a par value of $50 per share." So each share's par value is $50. Then, the price ranges are based on the market value, I think.

Wait, no, the way the problem is worded is that the par value is $50, so each share has a par value of $50. Then the price is set based on the market. But the way the problem is written, the price ranges are given based on the par value. Or perhaps, the price ranges are based on the market price relative to the par value.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says: Mr. Carr sold 300 shares of stock having a par value of $50 per share. What was the New York State transfer tax?

The prices are given as:

.01(1/4) a share for stocks under $5 a share par value. Wait, that can't be right. Because the par value is $50. So perhaps the price is set based on market value. Let me try to parse this again.

Wait, perhaps the price is determined by the market value relative to the par value. So the par value is $50. So:

- For stocks under $5 par value: no, wait, the par value is for each share is $50. So perhaps the price is based on the market value relative to $50.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of it as each share is sold at a price determined by the market, but based on the par value. So for example, if the par value is $50, and the market price is $55, what's the price per share? If the price is set as a fraction of the par value, like 0.01 (1/4) times the par value, then 0.01 * 50 = $0.50. Alternatively, it's $0.01 plus 1/4 of a dollar. Wait, 1/4 is 0.25, so 0.01 + 0.25 = $0.26 per share. So for a par value of $50, the price per share is 0.26.

Similarly, for the next range, price is 0.50 plus 0.50, which is $1.00 per share. So 0.50 (0.5) plus 0.5 is 1.00.

Third, 0.75 plus 0.75 is 1.50.

Fourth, over $20 par value: so for each share, the price is $1.00.

Wait, but that would mean that each share is sold at a price based on the market for each par value. So for each share, the price is calculated relative to the par value.

So if the par value is $50, and the market price is $51, then the price per share would be (51 / 50) * 50 = 51. Or perhaps, it's the price relative to the par value. So 0.01 (1/4) plus par value, meaning 0.01 + (1/4) = 0.26 per share.

Wait, maybe each share is sold at a price of (1/4)*par value plus 0.01. So for $50 par, 0.25 + 0.01 = $0.26 per share.

Another way: if the price is set as a fraction of the par value, like 1/4, then per share, it's 0.25 times par value. But in this case, the first option is 0.01 (1/4) a share for stocks under $5 par. Wait, that doesn't make sense because par is $50. So maybe the first part is 0.01 plus 1/4 of a dollar, which is $0.26 per share for stocks under $5 par value. But that can't be right since the par value is $50. Wait, perhaps it's the price per share is 0.01 plus 1/4 of a dollar, so $0.26 per share, regardless of the par value. But that doesn't seem to make sense because the par value is $50, so perhaps the price is set based on the par value, meaning that if the market price is above $50, the price per share is (par value) * 0.01 + 0.25. So 50 * 0.01 is 0.50, plus 0.25 is 0.75 per share. Hmm, but the first price listed is 0.26, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the way the price is calculated. Let me read the question again.

The problem states:

Mr. Carr sold 300 shares of stock having a par value of $50 per share. What was the New York State transfer tax?

The price ranges are:

.01(1/4) a share for stocks under $5 a share par value

0.50(1/2) a share for stocks from $5-$10 a share par value

0.75(3/4) a share for stocks from $10-$20 a share par value

1.00 a share for stocks over $20 a share par value

Wait, maybe the first price is 0.01 plus 1/4 of a dollar, which is $0.26 per share. That would apply to any par value, but that seems odd. Because if the par value is $50, then the price would be 0.26 regardless of par. That doesn't make sense. Perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the first option is 0.01 + 1/4 times the par value. For example, 0.01 + (1/4)*50 = 0.01 + 12.5 = 12.51 per share. But that seems way too high. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the price is calculated as a percentage of the par value. Like 1/4 of a dollar, which is 25 cents. So for a par value of $50, the price per share is $0.25 plus a fixed amount. Or perhaps it's $0.01 plus 0.25, which is $0.26. So each share is sold for $0.26, regardless of the par value. But that seems inconsistent, as the par value is $50 for each share. So maybe the price per share is $0.26, and it's based on the market value relative to the par value.

Wait, perhaps the price is set as a fraction of the par value. So for example, 0.01 (1/4) plus 0.25, so per share $0.26. So regardless of the par value, each share is sold for $0.26.

Wait, but then the par value is $50, so why would the price be $0.26? That seems too low. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the way the price is structured. Let me read again.

The first option is: .01(1/4) a share for stocks under $5 a share par value.

Wait, that might mean that for shares with a par value under $5, the price is $0.01 plus 1/4 of a dollar, which is $0.26 per share.

Similarly, the next option is 0.50(1/2) for shares from $5 to $10 par. So 0.50 + 0.50 = $1.00 per share.

Third, 0.75(3/4) for shares from $10 to $20. So 0.75 + 0.75 = $1.50 per share.

Fourth, 1.00 for shares over $20.

So in this case, each share's price is calculated as:

- Under $5 par value: $0.26

- $5-$10: $1.00

- $10-$20: $1.50

- Over $20: $1.00

Now, since Mr. Carr's shares are priced at $50 par value, which is over $20, so each share is sold at $1.00.

Wait, but wait, each share's par value is $50, but if the price is $1.00 per share, that's a 2% premium over the par value. That seems a bit high, but perhaps it's correct.

So, assuming each share is sold at $1.00, and the selling over $20, so that's the fourth category.

Now, the New York State transfer tax is for selling stocks. I think the problem is about calculating the NY state transfer tax on the sale of these shares.

Wait, I'm trying to remember how transfer taxes work. I think that when you sell stocks, the NY state tax is based on the amount of the sale. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact tax rate or how it's calculated. Alternatively, it could be a percentage of the sale.

Wait, perhaps the transfer tax is a percentage. For instance, 5% of the sale amount is taxed. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a flat tax, like 5% of the selling price.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think: if each share is sold at $1.00, and he sold 300 of them, then total selling price is 300 * $1.00 = $300.00.

If the tax rate is 5%, then 5% of $300 is $15. So the transfer tax would be $15, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the tax is a different rate, like 10%, that would be $30. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the tax is a flat rate, say 5% per transaction, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the transfer tax is based on the par value. Hmm. Let me think: each share's par value is $50, and the selling price is $1.00, which is a 2% premium. But 2% would be 0.02. So the transfer tax would be 0.02 * 300 = $6. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but maybe the tax is 5% of the par value. So 5% of $50 is $2.50 per share. 300 shares would be 300 * 2.50 = $750. That's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the transfer tax is 5% of the selling price per share. So 5% of $1 is $0.05 per share. 300 shares would be 300 * 0.05 = $15. That's option D.

Alternatively, maybe the tax is 10% of the selling price. 10% of $1 is $0.10 per share for 300 shares, which is $30, option F.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain, so I'll have to proceed based on the most plausible scenario.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the transfer tax is calculated as the amount over the par value, multiplied by a tax rate. For example, each share is sold at 2% over the par value, so 2% of $50 is $1, so 300 shares would be 300 * $1 = $300, which is not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the tax is 5% of the par value times the number of shares. So 5% of $50 is $2.50 per share. 300 shares would be 300 * $2.50 = $750. Not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it as a sales tax or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the tax is 5% on the total value of the shares sold. So 300 shares each at $1.00, so $300. 5% is $15, option D.

That seems plausible. So the answer would be D: $15.

The problem involves calculating the New York State transfer tax for Mr. Carr's stock sales. Here's the analysis:

1. **Price Calculation**:  
   - The par value of each share is $50.  
   - The selling price is determined by the given ranges:  
     - Under $5 par: $0.26 per share.  
     - $5-$10 par: $1.00 per share.  
     - $10-$20 par: $1.50 per share.  
     - Over $20 par: $1.00 per share.  
   - Since each share has a par value of $50, the price is set at $1.00 per share.

2. **Total Selling Price**:  
   - Mr. Carr sold 300 shares at $1.00 each:  
     Total = 300 * $1.00 = $300.00.

3. **Transfer Tax Calculation**:  
   - Assuming a transfer tax rate of 5% on the selling price:  
     Transfer Tax = 5% of $300 = 0.05 * $300 = $15.00.

4. **Answer**:  
   The transfer tax is $15, which corresponds to option D.
