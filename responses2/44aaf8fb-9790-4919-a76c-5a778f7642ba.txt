Okay, so I've got this question about money wages and real wages. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

Hmm, the question is asking me to distinguish between the two. Let me recall what each term means. I remember that money wages are related to the actual money earned by workers. But wait, what's the difference between money and real wages?

Oh right, real wages adjust for inflation. So real wages aren't the money you actually receive; they take into account how much purchasing power that money has had over time. Like, if you get $10 per hour, but it buys less now because of inflation, then the real wage is lower than the nominal wage.

So the key points I think are: 

- Money wages are the nominal amount earnedâ€”like what you get in cash. 
- Real wages are the purchasing power, which is money adjusted for inflation.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says money wages are the value of work, real are cash. Wait, that seems a bit off. I think real wages are about purchasing power, not cash. So maybe A is not correct.

Option B suggests they're the same. That can't be right because one adjusts for inflation, so they're different.

Option C: Money wages are cash spent, real are saved. No, that's not right. Money wages are what you get, real are adjusted.

Option D: Money wages are cash received per unit time, real indicate actual value or purchasing power. Oh, that sounds right. So D is probably the correct answer.

Wait to make sure. So money wage is the amount they earn in cash, like $10/hour. Real wage is, say, $9/hour because of inflation, so their purchasing power is less. So D is correct.

The correct answer is D, as it accurately distinguishes between money wages (the amount of cash received) and real wages (purchasing power, adjusted for inflation).

Answer: D
