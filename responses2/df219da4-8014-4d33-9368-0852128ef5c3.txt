Okay, so I've got this problem here about a TV that costs $226.50 with a 30% markup on the cost. I need to find the original cost. Hmm, let me think about how markup works. 

Wait, markup is usually the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So if the markup is 30% based on the cost, that means the selling price is the cost plus 30% of the cost. So, mathematically, the selling price would be the cost multiplied by (1 plus the markup percentage). 

So, the formula would be: Selling Price = Cost × (1 + Markup%). Let me write that down. 

Given that the selling price is $226.50 and the markup is 30%, which is 0.3 in decimal form. So plugging into the formula:

226.50 = Cost × (1 + 0.3)
226.50 = Cost × 1.3

Now, I need to solve for Cost. So, I'll divide both sides by 1.3.

Cost = 226.50 / 1.3

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 226.50 divided by 1.3. Let me do this step by step. 

First, I can think of 1.3 × 170 = 221. So 170 × 1.3 is 221. Now, 226.50 minus 221 is 5.50. 

So 1.3 × 4.235 = 5.50 because 1.3 × 4 = 5.2 and 1.3 × 0.235 is approximately 0.3055, so total is about 5.5055. So adding that to 221 gives 226.5055, which rounds to 226.50. 

So, 226.50 / 1.3 is 175.00. Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me double-check that division. Because 1.3 × 175 = 227.5, which is higher than 226.50. Oh wait, that's not right. I think I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should do the division more accurately. Let me try 226.50 divided by 1.3.

So, 1.3 into 226.50. Hmm, 1.3 × 170 = 221. So 226.50 minus 221 is 5.50. So 5.50 divided by 1.3 is how much? 5.50 ÷ 1.3 equals approximately 4.2307. So the total is 170 + 4.2307 = 174.2307. So approximately $174.23.

Looking at the options, option D is $174.23. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Another way to approach this is to set up the equation and solve step by step.

So, Selling Price = Cost × (1 + Markup)
226.50 = Cost × 1.3
So, Cost = 226.50 ÷ 1.3 = ?

Calculating 226.50 ÷ 1.3:

Let me do it long division style.

1.3 | 226.50

How many times does 1.3 go into 226.50? Let's see:

1.3 × 100 = 130. That's too low, since 130 is less than 226.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate decimals:

22650 ÷ 130.

Now, let's compute 22650 ÷ 130.

130 × 174 = 22620 (because 130 × 170 = 22100; 130 ×4=520 → 22100+520=22620).

So 130 × 174 = 22620.

The numerator is 22650, which is 30 more. So 30 ÷130 = 0.2307 approximately.

So, 174 + 0.2307 = 174.2307, which rounds to $174.23.

Yes, that's the same as before. So the cost is $174.23, which is option D.
</think>

The markup is 30% of the cost, so the selling price is 130% of the cost. To find the cost:

226.50 = Cost × 1.3  
Cost = 226.50 / 1.3  
Cost ≈ 174.23

The cost is $174.23, which is option D.
