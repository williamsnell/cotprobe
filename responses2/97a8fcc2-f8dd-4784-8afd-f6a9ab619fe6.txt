Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this multiple-choice question about combining fiscal and monetary policies to reduce inflation. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which combination of fiscal (tax policies) and monetary (interest rate) policies would help reduce inflation. The options are combinations of two actions: one from fiscal and one from the central bank's monetary policy.

First, I remember that both fiscal and monetary policies can be used to control inflation. Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation, while monetary policy affects the money supply and interest rates.

In the context of reducing inflation, the goal is usually to lower the money supply to prevent too much spending and keep prices in check. So, when the central bank increases the money supply, it can combat inflation by making borrowing cheaper. This is done through policies like buying government securities (which makes it easier for people to borrow) or lowering interest rates (making savings and loans more attractive).

On the other hand, fiscal policy can be either expansionary or contractionary. Expansionary policies increase government spending or cut taxes to stimulate the economy and reduce inflationary pressures. Contractionary policies reduce spending or increase taxes to cool down the economy and cool down the money supply.

So, the right combination would be a contractionary fiscal policy (like decreasing taxes or increasing spending) combined with an expansionary monetary policy (like buying government securities to increase the money supply). This should dampen inflation because the economy is being stimulate (due to fiscal) but the money supply is increasing (due to monetary), which can counteract the expansion.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Decrease taxes (fiscal) and Sell government securities (monetary). Wait, selling government securities would reduce the money supply because the government is selling its debt. So when the Fed sells bonds, they take money from the market, which reduces the money supply. That would be a contractionary monetary policy, which actually worsens the situation, but also, decreasing taxes would do fiscal contraction. So this combination might help because the Fed is selling bonds (shaking up the economy, but maybe not enough). But the fiscal part is decreasing taxes, which is a contractionary fiscal policy. So both are contributing to a contraction in the economy. But the money supply might be increasing because selling bonds reduces it. I'm not sure if this combination is effective, but let me evaluate the others.

Option B: Decrease taxes and Increase reserve ratio. Decreasing taxes is contractionary. Increasing the reserve ratio would mean banks hold more cash, which reduces the money available for lending. So that's a contractionary monetary policy. So both are contractionary. That's good for reducing inflation because money is running out, so people borrow less. But I'm not sure if this is the best combination.

Option C: Increase spending and Buy government securities. Increasing spending is expansionary fiscal. Buying government securities would increase the money supply, which is expansionary monetary. So both are positive. That would stimulate the economy, which might help reduce inflation. But would it be the correct combination? Because the question is about reducing inflation, not necessarily accelerating it. But the question is about combinations that would likely accomplish the goal. So this might be a good option.

Option D: Increase taxes and Increase discount ratio. Increase taxes is contractionary. The discount ratio is related to the money supply. An increase in the discount rate (making it more expensive to borrow money) would decrease the money supply, which is contractionary. So both are contractionary, which is good for reducing inflation. But I'm not sure if this is the best option.

Option E: Decrease spending and Decrease the reserve ratio. Decreasing spending is contractionary. Decreasing the reserve ratio allows more money to be lent out, increasing the money supply, which is expansionary. So both are contractionary, which might help but perhaps not the best combination.

Option F: Decrease spending and Buy government securities. Decreasing spending is contractionary. Buying government securities would increase the money supply, which would help. This combination has both contractionary policies. So this could be good.

Option G: Decrease taxes and Decrease the discount ratio. Decreasing taxes is contractionary. Decreasing the discount ratio (which relates to the money supply) would reduce the money supply, which is contractionary. So both are good.

Option H: Increase spending and Increase the discount ratio. Increasing spending is expansionary. Increase the discount ratio (more expensive borrowing) would decrease money supply, which is contractionary. So both are good.

Option I: Increase spending and Sell government securities. Increase spending is expansionary. Selling government securities reduces money supply, which is contractionary. So both are good.

Option J: Increase taxes and Decrease the reserve ratio. Increase taxes is contractionary. Decreasing reserve ratio increases money supply, which is contractionary. So both are good.

Wait, but the question is about which combination would 'likely accomplish' the goal of reducing inflation. So all these options have a mix that could help, but perhaps the best ones are the ones that are both contractionary but perhaps more effective.

Wait, let's think about the interplay between the two policies. If the central bank increases the money supply (monetary contraction) and reduces government spending (fiscal contraction), that's a two-pronged approach. So the money supply increases, and the economy isn't being stimulated much. That should help reduce inflation.

So, the correct combination is when both are contractionary.

Looking again at the options, which ones have both contractionary actions?

Option C: Increase spending (expansionary) and Buy (monetary contraction). No, that's one expansionary and one contractionary.

Option F: Decrease spending (expansionary?) Wait, no. Decreasing spending is contractionary. So F is decrease spending (contractionary) and buy (contractionary, because buying bonds increases money supply). So both are contractionary.

Option G: Decrease taxes (contractionary) and decrease discount ratio (contractionary). So both are contractionary.

Option H: Increase spending (expansionary) and increase discount ratio (contractionary). So one is expansionary, the other contractionary.

Option I: Increase spending (expansionary) and sell (contractionary). So one is expansionary, one is contractionary.

Option J: Increase taxes (contractionary) and decrease reserve ratio (contractionary). So both are contractionary.

Wait, so options F, G, J are both contractionary.

Wait, but the question is about which combination would likely accomplish the goal, meaning that both need to work together to reduce inflation.

Wait, perhaps the best option is F: Decrease spending and buy government securities.

Wait, because both are contractionary. Decreasing spending is a fiscal contraction, and buying bonds is a monetary contraction. So both are working against the inflationary push.

Alternatively, G: Decrease taxes ( fiscal contraction) and decrease the discount ratio ( monetary contraction).

Hmm.

Wait, the main goal is to reduce inflation. So the best way is to reduce the money supply (monetary contraction) and reduce the demand (fiscal contraction).

Which option has both?

Looking at each option:

Option F: Decrease spending (fiscal contraction) and buy (monetary contraction). Both are contractionary. So this combination would lower money supply and reduce demand. That sounds good.

Option G: Decrease taxes (fiscal contraction) and decrease discount ratio (monetary contraction). Both contractionary.

Option H: Increase spending (expansionary) and increase discount ratio (contractionary). So one is expansionary; the other is contractionary. So net effect may be contractionary.

Option I: Increase spending and sell bonds (contractionary). Again, one is expansionary, the other is contractionary.

Option J: Increase taxes (contractionary) and decrease reserve ratio (contractionary). Both are contractionary.

So options F, G, J are all contractionary.

Wait, the question is about which combination would 'likely accomplish' the goal of reducing inflation. So all of these would help, but perhaps the best combination is F, G, or J.

Wait, but let me think about what each option does.

Option F: Decrease spending (fiscal) reduces demand, which is a contractionary policy. Buy government securities would increase the money supply, which is a contractionary monetary policy. So both are working against inflation. That would work.

Option G: Decrease taxes (fiscal) reduces demand. Decrease discount ratio (which relates to money supply) makes it harder for people to borrow, so money supply decreases. Both are contractionary.

Option J: Increase taxes (fiscal) reduces demand (contractionary). Decrease reserve ratio (money supply) reduces it, so both are contractionary.

But perhaps the correct answer is F. Let me think about each option again.

The question is: which combination would likely accomplish the goal. So all these options have at least one expansionary policy, but both are contractionary.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: Decrease spending and buy (monetary contraction). Because it's a two-pronged contractionary approach.

But another thought: when the central bank buys bonds, it makes the government debt more attractive to investors, which increases the money supply. So that's a contractionary monetary policy. So that's good for reducing inflation.

Decreasing spending is a contractionary fiscal policy. So both are good.

So, the correct answer would be F, G, or J. But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Decrease spending and Buy (monetary).

Option G: Decrease taxes and Decrease discount ratio.

Option J: Increase taxes and Decrease reserve ratio.

Alternatively, let's think about which combination is more commonly cited in economic policy.

I remember that the Fed's actions: buying bonds (monetary expansion) and selling bonds (contractionary).

Wait, but the question is about a combination of fiscal and monetary policies. So, the central bank is combining. Thus, the correct combination is one of the options that is both contractionary.

So, which options are both contractionary?

Looking at the options:

Option F: Decrease spending (fiscal) and buy (monetary). Both are contractionary.

Option G: Decrease taxes (fiscal) and decrease discount ratio (monetary). Both are contractionary.

Option J: Increase taxes (fiscal) and decrease reserve ratio (monetary). Both are contractionary.

So all three options (F, G, J) have both policies as contractionary. But the question is asking which combination would likely accomplish the goal.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is F: Decrease spending and buy. Because the Fed's policy is to increase the money supply by buying bonds. That's a contractionary monetary policy. So the combination is correct.

But I'm a bit conflicted because I'm not certain. Let me think about how fiscal and monetary policies interact. The best way to reduce inflation is to both decrease demand (fiscal) and increase the money supply (monetary). So the correct combination would be both.

Looking again, option F: Decrease spending (fiscal) and buy (monetary). So both are contractionary.

Wait, but in option F, both are contractionary. So that's good.

Alternatively, option G: Decrease taxes (fiscal contraction) and decrease discount ratio (monetary contraction). So both are contractionary.

But wait, buying bonds (F) increases money supply (monetary contraction) and decreases spending (fiscal contraction). So both are good.

So both F and G are correct, but the options don't have multiple correct answers. So perhaps I need to look for the correct pair.

Wait, the question is about which combination would likely accomplish the goal. So all three (F, G, J) are combinations where both policies are contractionary. But perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is option F: Decrease spending and buy (monetary).

Because that's the combination that both reduces demand and increases the money supply. That's a two-pronged approach.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another way to think is that both the fiscal and monetary policies are contractionary. So the correct answer would be F, G, or J.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: Decrease spending and buy (monetary).

Because, for example, decreasing taxes (fiscal) reduces demand. Buying bonds (monetary) makes the money supply increase. Both actions would help reduce inflation.

So, the correct option would be F.

Wait, but let me think about option J: Increase taxes and decrease reserve ratio. Both are contractionary. So that's also a correct combination.

So, four options have both policies as contractionary. The question is which one.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is F. Because the Fed's approach is to buy bonds and then sell bonds. So, option F's combination is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F: Decrease spending and buy. So the answer is F.

Wait, but let me think of the actual options again. The options are:

A: Decrease taxes and Sell.

B: Decrease taxes and Increase reserve ratio.

C: Increase spending and Buy.

D: Increase taxes and Increase discount ratio.

E: Decrease spending and Decrease reserve ratio.

F: Decrease spending and Buy.

G: Decrease taxes and Decrease discount ratio.

H: Increase spending and Increase discount ratio.

I: Increase spending and Sell.

J: Increase taxes and Decrease reserve ratio.

Hmm, the correct answer is likely option F.

Wait, but another approach is to recall that the combination of contractionary fiscal and contractionary monetary policies is a common way to reduce inflation. So options F, G, J.

But the question is which would be the best combination.

Wait, the question is about which combination is likely to accomplish the goal. So all three (F, G, J) are correct. But in the options, each is presented as a separate choice.

But the options don't allow multiple correct answers, so perhaps the intended correct answer is F.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not certain. So perhaps I should recall that when the central bank buys bonds (Option F), it increases the money supply, which is a contractionary monetary policy. So that's a good thing. Decreasing spending is a fiscal contraction.

So, both are working to reduce inflation. So option F is correct.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another way: when the Fed buys bonds, they issue bonds to the public, which become part of the money supply. So it's a contractionary policy. So the combination is correct.

So the answer would be F.

Wait, but let me also think about other options.

Option G: Decrease taxes (fiscal) and decrease the discount ratio.

The discount ratio is related to the money supply. Lowering the discount rate makes it more expensive to borrow money, thus reducing the money supply.

So, both are contractionary.

So the combination is correct.

So the correct answer is F, G, or J.

But in the options, only one is correct. So what's the correct pair.

Wait, perhaps the best combination is F: Decrease spending and buy (monetary). Because both are correct.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option F.

I think the correct answer is F: Decrease spending and buy (monetary). So option F is correct.

To reduce inflation, the combination of fiscal and monetary policies must address both the demand-side and supply-side pressures. A contractionary fiscal policy (e.g., decreasing taxes or increasing spending) reduces demand, while a contractionary monetary policy (e.g., buying government bonds or lowering the discount ratio) reduces the money supply. Both actions work together to reduce inflationary pressures.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (Decrease taxes, Sell government securities):** Decreasing taxes is contractionary, but selling government bonds (money supply increase) is also contractionary. Both are good, but the focus is on fiscal, not monetary policies.
- **Option B (Decrease taxes, Increase reserve ratio):** Both are contractionary, but the focus is on fiscal, and the money supply increase is less impactful.
- **Option C (Increase spending, Buy government securities):** Both are expansionary, which worsens inflation.
- **Option D (Increase taxes, Increase discount ratio):** Both are contractionary, but the money supply decrease is less impactful.
- **Option E (Decrease spending, Decrease reserve ratio):** Both are contractionary, but the focus is on fiscal, and the money supply decrease is less impactful.
- **Option F (Decrease spending, Buy government securities):** Both are contractionary, effectively addressing both the demand-side and money supply-side pressures.
- **Option G (Decrease taxes, Decrease discount ratio):** Both are contractionary, focusing on fiscal and monetary policies respectively.
- **Option H (Increase spending, Increase discount ratio):** Both are expansionary, which worsens inflation.
- **Option I (Increase spending, Sell government securities):** Both are expansionary, which worsens inflation.
- **Option J (Increase taxes, Decrease reserve ratio):** Both are contractionary, but the focus is on fiscal, and the money supply decrease is less impactful.

### Conclusion:
The best combination is **Option F (Decrease spending and Buy government securities)**, as both are contractionary policies that effectively reduce demand and increase the money supply, thereby combating inflation.
