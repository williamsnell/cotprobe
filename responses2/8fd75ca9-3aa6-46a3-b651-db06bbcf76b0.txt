Okay, so I've got this problem here about Leo's Restaurant purchasing a neon sign. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question states that Leo's Restaurant bought a neon sign on July 1 for $202. The terms are 3/10, n/30, and the R.O.G. I think that's the return, security, and exchange terms. So the payment terms are 3% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise the full amount is due within 30 days.

The delivery date is July 12, which is the date the goods were delivered. Now, the payment was made on July 20. I need to figure out if this falls within the 10-day window to take advantage of the discount.

July 1 is the purchase date. So July 12 is when they received the goods. The payment is on July 20. Let's calculate the number of days between July 1 and July 20. From July 1 to July 12 is 11 days, so from July 12 to 20 is 8 days. So 11 + 8 = 19 days total.

Wait, no. Wait, July 1 to July 12 is exactly 11 days. Because from 1 to 2 is 1 day, so 1 to 12 is 11 days. Then from 12 to 20 is 8 days. So total is 19 days. 

So 19 days is within the 10-day window? No, wait. Because the discount is for the first 10 days. So if the payment is made on July 20, that's 19 days after July 1. Wait, noâ€”July 1 to July 20 is 19 days (because including both days? Or is it 19 days from July 1? Let me think: July 1 is day 0, July 2 is day 1, up to July 20, which is day 19. So the payment is made on day 19, which is more than 10 days after the purchase. So they can't take the 3% discount. 

So the discount terms: 3% off if paid within 10 days. Since payment was on July 20, which is 19 days after July 1, which is more than 10 days. So the discount doesn't apply. Therefore, the full amount is due, and Leo would pay $202.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the payment date. The delivery was on July 12. So any delay in payment after that would be counted. So July 12 is when they got it, and July 20 is when they paid. So from July 1 to July 20 is 19 days. So 19 days is longer than 10 days, so discount not applicable. Thus, the amount paid is $202, which is option D.

To determine the amount paid, we examine the payment terms and the timeline.

- **Purchase Date**: July 1 for $202 with terms 3/10, n/30.
- **Delivery Date**: July 12. Payment was made on July 20.
- **Days from Purchase to Payment**: 19 days (July 1 to July 20).

- **Discount Eligibility**: The discount (3%) applies if payment is made within 10 days. July 20 is 19 days after purchase, exceeding the discount period.

- **Payment**: Since no discount is applicable, the full amount of $202 is due.

Answer: D: $202.00
