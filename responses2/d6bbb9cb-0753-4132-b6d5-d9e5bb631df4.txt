Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem about equilibrium constants and degree of dissociation. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. Alright, the question gives the reaction CO(g) + Cl2(g) ↔ COCl2(g), right? And the equilibrium partial pressures are given as PCl2 = 0.128 atm, P_CO = 0.116 atm, and P(COCl)2 = 0.334 atm. They're asking for the equilibrium constant Kp and the degree of dissociation at 395 K under a pressure of 1 atm.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, the problem states that the equilibrium partial pressures are given. So I don't think the 1 atm pressure is necessary for calculating the degree of dissociation because in the expression for Kp, the pressures are given. Oh, but wait, maybe the 1 atm is part of the setup for the problem. Let me check the question again.

The question says, 'determine the equilibrium constant Kp for the dissociation of phosgene and the degree of dissociation at 395 K under a pressure of 1 atm.' So the pressures are given, which are 0.128, 0.116, and 0.334 atm. So the Kp is calculated using those pressures.

Wait, but the problem is giving the correct Kp? Let me see. The reaction is CO + Cl2 → COCl2. So the expression for Kp would be (PCOCl2)/(PCO * Cl2). Oh wait, but Cl2 is a reactant, so its partial pressure is in the denominator.

Wait, the given pressures: I think I should double-check which pressures correspond to which.

In the reaction, the products and reactants are COCl2, CO, and Cl2. So the Kp is (PCOCl2) / (PCO * Cl2). Let me plug in the numbers.

So PCOCl2 is 0.334 atm. PCO is 0.116 atm. Cl2 is the reactant, so its partial pressure is 0.128 atm.

Wait wait, no, wait. Kp is based on the products over the reactants, but since Cl2 is a reactant, its pressure is in the denominator.

So Kp = (PCOCl2) / (PCO * Cl2). Let me compute that.

So putting in the numbers:

PCOCl2 = 0.334 atm
PCO = 0.116 atm
Cl2 = 0.128 atm.

So numerator is 0.334. Denominator is 0.116 * 0.128. Let me calculate that.

0.116 * 0.128: 0.116 * 0.1 is 0.0116, 0.116 * 0.028 is 0.003248. Wait, but 0.128 is 0.1 + 0.028. So 0.116 * 0.128 = (0.1 * 0.116) + (0.028 * 0.116). 0.1 * 0.116 is 0.0116. 0.028 * 0.116: 0.02 * 0.116 is 0.00232, 0.008 * 0.116 is 0.000928. So 0.00232 + 0.000928 = 0.003248. Adding 0.0116 + 0.003248 = 0.014848 atm².

So Kp is 0.334 / 0.014848 ≈ let's compute that. 0.334 divided by 0.014848.

Let me compute this:

Approximately, 0.334 / 0.0148 ≈ 3.34 / 0.0148 ≈ Let me compute 0.0148 * 226 = 3.3368. Oh, wait, 0.0148 * 226 = 0.0148 * 200 = 2.96; 0.0148 * 26 = 0.3848. Sum is 3.3448, which is about 0.334. So 226, so Kp ≈ 226 atm.

Wait, but that's a very large Kp, which would mean that the reaction favors products. Hmm, but in the given options, the first value (the Kp) is 0.0444, 0.0944, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the numbers. Did I write the formula correctly?

Wait, the reaction is CO + Cl2 → COCl2. So Kp is (PCOCl2) / (PCO * Cl2).

So, 0.334 / (0.116 * 0.128). Let me compute the denominator again.

0.116 multiplied by 0.128: 0.116 * 0.128. Let me compute it accurately.

0.116 * 0.128:

0.116 * 0.1 = 0.0116; 0.116 * 0.02 = 0.00232; 0.116 * 0.008 = 0.000928.

Wait, but 0.128 is 0.1 + 0.02 + 0.008, but wait, that's not right. Wait, 0.128 is 0.1 + 0.02 + 0.008. Wait, 0.1 + 0.02 is 0.12, plus 0.008 is 0.128. So 0.116 * 0.128 = sum of 0.116*(0.1) + 0.116*(0.02) + 0.116*(0.008).

0.116 * 0.1 is 0.0116.

0.116 * 0.02 is 0.00232.

0.116 * 0.008 is 0.000928.

Adding these together: 0.0116 + 0.00232 = 0.01392 + 0.000928 = 0.014848 atm².

So yes, denominator is 0.014848.

Numerator is 0.334. So 0.334 / 0.014848 ≈ Let me compute that.

Let me compute 0.334 / 0.014848.

So 0.334 ÷ 0.014848 = (334 × 1e-3) / (14.848 × 1e-3) ) → same as 334 / 14.848 ≈ let me compute that.

14.848 * 22 = 326.416. 14.848 * 22.2 = 14.848*(22 + 0.2) = 326.416 + 2.9696 = 329.3856. Still less than 334.

Wait, let me compute 14.848 * x = 334.

x = 334 /14.848 ≈ let's divide 334 by 14.848.

14.848 × 22.6 ≈ 14.848 * 20 = 296.96, 14.848 *2.6= approx. 14.848 *2=29.696, 14.848 *0.6=8.9088. So 29.696 + 8.9088 =38.6048. So 20+2.6=22.6 gives 296.96 +38.6048=335.5648. Which is a bit more than 334. So 22.6 gives 335.56, which is over 334 by about 1.56.

So x ≈ 22.6 - (1.56 / (14.848 per 0.01)) → but perhaps better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

334 / 14.848 ≈ 22.59 approximately.

So Kp is approximately 22.59 atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first values are 0.0444, 0.0944, etc. So none of those are close to 22.59. That can't be right. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the pressure terms. Wait, the reaction is written as CO(g) + Cl2(g) ↔ COCl2(g). So the Kp is (PCOCl2)/(PCO*Cl2). So if I made a mistake in the formula, perhaps I should have (PCOCl2)/(PCO * Cl2) as I did.

Wait, so the calculation gives Kp ≈22.6. But the options all have Kp around 0.04 to 0.12, which is much lower. So I must have made a mistake in the way I set up Kp.

Wait, perhaps I confused the reaction. Let me double-check the reaction.

The reaction is CO + Cl2 → COCl2. So the correct Kp is (PCOCl2)/(PCO * Cl2) → so that's correct.

Hmm, so why is the Kp so large? Because COCl2 is a product and Cl2 is a reactant. So if you have more COCl2, the reaction favors that direction. So the Kp is large, meaning more product.

But wait, the problem says the answer options have Kp around 0.0444, which is about 0.044 atm. So there's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait, another approach: maybe I mixed up the reactants and products in the Kp expression. Wait, the formula is (PCOCl2) / (PCO * Cl2). So that's correct. So the Kp would be around 22.6, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the pressures are given in different units. Oh, the question says 'partial pressures are PCI2 = 0.128atm, P_CO = 0.116atm, and P(COCl)2= 0.334atm.' So the values are correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a typo, but I have to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the problem is asking for Kp, but perhaps I forgot some stoichiometric coefficients. The reaction is one mole each of CO and Cl2 forming one mole of COCl2. So, the Kp is correct as written.

Alternatively, perhaps the question asks for the degree of dissociation, which is different from Kp. Because the degree of dissociation would be (PCOCl2 - P COCl2) / (PCOCl2 + P CO + P Cl2). Hmm, wait, no, that's the usual formula.

Wait, the degree of dissociation, α, is the fraction of the initial reactants that have dissociated. So for the reaction aA + bB ↔ cC + dD, the expression for α is ( (PC_C + PD_D) ) / (PC_C + PD_D + PA_A + PB_B - (dPC_C + dPB_D) ) ), but perhaps more accurately, it's (initial - equilibrium) / initial. 

Wait, maybe I should calculate the degree of dissociation. Let's try that.

The initial pressures are:

PCO: 0.116 atm

PCOCl2: 0.334 atm

Cl2: 0.128 atm.

The total pressure is the sum, but wait the problem says it's under a pressure of 1 atm. Oh, wait, but the given pressures already sum to 0.116 + 0.334 + 0.128 = 0.578 atm. So if the total pressure is 1 atm, that would mean the pressures are each multiplied by (1 / 0.578) to make the total 1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 'under a pressure of 1 atm.' Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the given pressures are already under 1 atm, so their sum is 0.116 + 0.334 + 0.128 = 0.578 atm. So the total pressure is 0.578 atm. To make it 1 atm, each partial pressure would be multiplied by (1/0.578). But when you calculate the degree of dissociation, it's based on the initial pressures before any change, so perhaps the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures, and their sum is 0.578. So the degree of dissociation would be based on the change from the initial.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's setup the ICE table.

The reaction: CO + Cl2 ↔ COCl2.

Initial pressures (before reaction): [CO] = 0.116 atm, [Cl2] =0.128 atm, [COCl2]=0.334 atm.

Change: Let’s say that x atm of CO and Cl2 react to form x atm of COCl2.

So:

Change: CO → -x, Cl2 → -x, COCl2 → +x.

At equilibrium:

CO: 0.116 - x

Cl2: 0.128 - x

COCl2: 0.334 + x

Wait, but wait, initial COCl2 is 0.334, but the reaction produces x amount of COCl2. So the equilibrium pressure is 0.334 + x, right?

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the equilibrium partial pressures are given. So, in the problem, the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures.

So, from the given data:

PCOCl2 = 0.334 atm → so 0.334 = 0.334 + x → Hmm, that would suggest x is zero, which doesn't make sense. Wait no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I got the setup wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the ICE table, the initial pressures are 0.116, 0.128, 0.334. At equilibrium, the same values are given as the pressures. So, from the reaction, we have:

At equilibrium, the partial pressures are:

PCO = 0.116 - x = 0.116 - x

PCOCl2 = 0.334 + x

Cl2 = 0.128 - x

Wait, but according to the problem, the given pressures are the equilibrium ones. So:

0.116 - x = 0.116 → x = 0. That can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that x is zero, which would mean no reaction has occurred. But that can't be correct because according to the given pressures, at equilibrium, the pressure of COCl2 is 0.334 atm, which is more than the initial. Which would require that some of the CO and Cl2 have reacted to form COCl2.

Wait, that makes sense. So, let me set up the ICE table correctly.

Initial:
PCO = 0.116
Cl2 = 0.128
COCl2 = 0.334

Change: Let x be the amount that reacts. So:

CO becomes (0.116 - x)
Cl2 becomes (0.128 - x)
COCl2 becomes (0.334 + x)

At equilibrium, the pressures are:

PCO = 0.116 - x = 0.116 (as given)
Cl2 = 0.128 - x = 0.128 (given)
COCl2 = 0.334 + x = 0.334 (given)

Wait, but this can't be right because 0.128 -x = 0.128 → x=0. So that's a problem. Because COCl2's pressure is 0.334, which is higher than the initial 0.334.

Wait, this is confusing. Because according to the given equilibrium pressures, the COCl2 is at 0.334 atm, which would require that some CO and Cl2 have reacted to form more COCl2. But our initial Cl2 is 0.128, so if x is positive, Cl2 would be 0.128 - x, which can't be negative. So for 0.128 - x = 0.128, x must be zero, which again suggests no reaction, which conflicts with the given COCl2 pressure.

Hmm, this seems impossible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me go back to the setup. Oh wait wait, perhaps I got the initial pressures wrong. Because the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures, but the initial should have been higher.

Wait, no. The given pressures are the equilibrium pressures. So the initial pressures for the reaction are higher. Wait, no, that's not correct. The given pressures are the equilibrium, so the initial would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

The reaction is CO + Cl2 → COCl2.

At equilibrium, the partial pressures are:

PCO = 0.116 atm

Cl2 = 0.128 atm

COCl2 = 0.334 atm.

So, let's let 'x' be the extent of reaction. So, the change in pressure is:

CO decreases by x → 0.116 - x.

Cl2 decreases by x → 0.128 - x.

COCl2 increases by x → 0.334 + x.

But according to the given data, the equilibrium pressures are the same as their initial. So:

0.116 -x =0.116 → x=0

0.128 -x=0.128 → x=0

0.334 +x=0.334 → x=0.

Again, this suggests x=0, which is impossible because the equilibrium COCl2 is higher than the initial.

Wait, I think I've found the crux of the problem. The given pressures are the equilibrium pressures, but the initial pressures must have been higher, so I'm trying to find the change in the reverse direction. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures before any reaction, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the extent of reaction in reverse.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the problem by finding the degree of dissociation (alpha) based on the given pressures, which are the equilibrium pressures.

The degree of dissociation is given by the fraction of the initial reactants that have dissociated.

So, for the reaction:

CO + Cl2 ↔ COCl2.

Let the initial concentrations be:

[CO]_initial = a

[Cl2]_initial = b

[COCl2]_initial = c.

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

[CO] = a - x

[Cl2] = b - x

[COCl2] = c + x.

Where x is the amount of reaction that has occurred.

In the problem, the given equilibrium pressures are:

PCO = 0.116 atm → which equals a - x.

Cl2 = 0.128 atm → which equals b - x.

COCl2 = 0.334 atm → which equals c + x.

But wait, the problem gives these as the equilibrium pressures. So, solving for x:

From the given, (a - x) = 0.116,

(b -x) = 0.128,

(c + x) = 0.334.

But we also know that the initial pressures would be:

a + b + c = (a + b + c) = total pressure.

But the problem doesn't give the total pressure, and in our case, the given pressures are 0.116 + 0.128 + 0.334 = 0.578 atm, which is the sum of the partial pressures. So, the total pressure is 0.578 atm.

Now, the problem states that the reaction is under a pressure of 1 atm. So, perhaps the partial pressures are scaled down by a factor to make the total 1 atm. So each pressure would be multiplied by (1/0.578).

But I'm not sure if that's necessary for the calculation of the degree of dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures, and I can calculate the degree of dissociation based on the change from the initial.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it by assuming that the reaction went in the reverse direction, so that the given pressures represent the equilibrium of the reverse reaction.

Wait, the reverse reaction would be COCl2 ↔ CO + Cl2.

In this case, the initial pressure of COCl2 is 0.334 atm, and the initial pressures of CO and Cl2 are zero. The change would be x, so the equilibrium pressures would be:

PCO: x

Cl2: x

COCl2: 0.334 - x.

But in the problem, the equilibrium pressures are 0.116, 0.128, and 0.334, which don't match this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the given equilibrium pressures as the result of the reaction, and set up the ICE to find the degree of dissociation.

Let me try again. Let me write the ICE table correctly.

The reaction is CO + Cl2 ↔ COCl2.

Initial pressures (before any reaction): 

PCO = x,

Cl2 = y,

COCl2 = z.

At equilibrium, the partial pressures are:

PCO = x - a,

Cl2 = y - a,

COCl2 = z + a.

But according to the given equilibrium pressures, 

PCO = 0.116,

Cl2 = 0.128,

COCl2 = 0.334.

So, we can write:

x - a = 0.116,

y - a = 0.128,

z + a = 0.334.

But the problem gives x = 0.116, y = 0.128, z = 0.334.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because x, y, z are the initial pressures.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: The given pressures are the equilibrium pressures. So, the initial pressures must have been higher, and the reaction must have proceeded to reach the given equilibrium.

Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the given pressures are not the equilibrium pressures, but the pressures at a certain point in the reaction. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the given partial pressures are the equilibrium pressures, and I can compute the degree of dissociation using the ICE table.

So, let me set up the ICE table.

At equilibrium, the partial pressures are:

PCO = 0.116 atm.

Cl2 = 0.128 atm.

COCl2 = 0.334 atm.

Let me see what that implies.

The reaction is CO + Cl2 ↔ COCl2.

Let me let x be the extent of reaction in the reverse direction (so COCl2 is being consumed, and CO and Cl2 are being produced).

So, the ICE table would be:

Initial:

PCO = 0.116

Cl2 = 0.128

COCl2 = 0.334

Change:

- x → (since it's reverse)

PCO: 0.116 + x

Cl2: 0.128 + x

COCl2: 0.334 - x

But according to the problem, the equilibrium pressures are given as 0.116, 0.128, 0.334. So, setting these equal to the expressions from the ICE table.

So:

PCO: 0.116 + x = 0.116 → x =0.

Cl2: 0.128 + x =0.128 → x=0.

COCl2: 0.334 -x =0.334 → x=0.

Again, this suggests that no reaction has occurred, which can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup. Let me consider that the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures of the reaction, but perhaps the reaction is not proceeding to reach these pressures. Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that the reaction is proceeding in the forward direction, but this doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the degree of dissociation regardless of the setup. Let's think differently.

The degree of dissociation (alpha) is given by the formula:

α = ( (equilibrium concentrations) - (initial concentrations) ) / (initial concentrations) )

But in this case, the problem gives the equilibrium pressures as 0.116, 0.128, 0.334, but the initial pressures would have been higher.

Wait, perhaps I should set the initial pressures as the given equilibrium pressures, which can't be correct because that would mean the reaction hasn't proceeded.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm allowed to consider that the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures, and to calculate the degree of dissociation based on the change.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the degree of dissociation.

Let α be the degree of dissociation. Then, the change in pressure for each species would be:

CO: α * (PCO_initial - 0) = α * (PCO_initial)

Cl2: α * (Cl2_initial -0) = α * (Cl2_initial)

COCl2: α * (PCO_initial + Cl2_initial - PCO_initial - Cl2_initial) ) → Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the proper approach is to recognize that the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures, and to calculate the degree of dissociation using the given data.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The given data are the equilibrium pressures, which are:

PCO = 0.116 atm

Cl2 = 0.128 atm

COCl2 = 0.334 atm.

The reaction is CO + Cl2 → COCl2.

So, the ICE table would be:

Initial:

PCO = a

Cl2 = b

COCl2 = c.

Change:

- x (because CO and Cl2 are being consumed, and COCl2 is being produced.)

At equilibrium:

PCO = a - x = 0.116

Cl2 = b - x = 0.128

COCl2 = c + x = 0.334.

But the initial pressures a, b, c are not given, so I can't proceed this way.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the given pressures are the equilibrium pressures of the reverse reaction. So, the reaction is COCl2 → CO + Cl2.

In this case, the initial pressures would be 0.334 atm each for CO and Cl2, and 0 atm for COCl2.

At equilibrium, the partial pressures are:

PCO = 0.334 - x,

Cl2 = 0.334 - x,

COCl2 = x.

But according to the problem, the equilibrium pressures are 0.116, 0.128, 0.334.

So, if I set:

0.334 - x = 0.334 → x=0.

0.116 and 0.128 would then be 0, which is not possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck.

Alternative approach: Let me use the given data to find the Kp, then find the degree of dissociation.

Given data:

PCOCl2 = 0.334 atm

PCO = 0.116 atm

Cl2 = 0.128 atm.

So, according to the reaction:

CO + Cl2 ↔ COCl2.

The Kp is:

Kp = (PCOCl2) / (PCO * Cl2) = (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) → let me compute this.

0.334 / (0.116 * 0.128) = 0.334 / (0.014848) ≈ 22.42.

So, Kp ≈ 22.42.

Now, the degree of dissociation (α) can be found using the formula:

α = ( (P_CO_initial - P_CO_eq) ) / (P_CO_initial )

But I don't have P_CO_initial, and I don't have P_CO_eq. Instead, I have the equilibrium pressures, which are 0.116, 0.128, and 0.334.

Wait, perhaps the degree of dissociation can be calculated using the formula:

α = ( ( (P_CO_initial - P_CO_eq) ) ) / (P_CO_initial )

But I don't know P_CO_initial or P_CO_eq. However, I can express P_CO_initial as (PCO_initial) = (PCO_eq + x), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

α = ( ( (P_CO_initial - P_CO_eq) ) ) / (P_CO_initial )

But again, without knowing P_CO_initial, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for degree of dissociation in terms of the equilibrium pressures.

The formula is:

α = ( ( (P_CO_initial - P_CO_eq) ) ) / (P_CO_initial )

= [ ( ( (P_CO_initial - P_CO_eq) ) ) / (P_CO_initial) ) ]

But I don't know P_CO_initial.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the degree of dissociation in terms of the equilibrium concentrations.

The formula is:

α = ( ( (x) ) ) / ( (a + b) )

Where x is the extent of reaction, a and b are the initial pressures.

But without knowing a and b, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for α in terms of Kp:

α = sqrt( (1 - Kp) ) / (1 + Kp) )

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the degree of dissociation can be calculated using the expression for the equilibrium constant and the partial pressures.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the degree of dissociation as follows:

The degree of dissociation is determined by the change from the initial to the equilibrium state. The initial pressures are higher, and the reaction proceeds until the given equilibrium pressures are achieved.

But without knowing the initial pressures, this is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the given data is the equilibrium data, so the initial pressures must be higher. Then, we can calculate the change in pressure as the reaction proceeds.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the following ICE table, assuming that the reaction proceeds in the forward direction.

Initial pressures:

PCO = a,

Cl2 = b,

COCl2 = c.

Change:

+ x,

+ x,

- x (since COCl2 is consumed, and CO and Cl2 are produced).

At equilibrium:

PCO = a + x,

Cl2 = b + x,

COCl2 = c - x.

But according to the problem, the equilibrium pressures are 0.116, 0.128, 0.334.

So,

a + x = 0.116,

b + x = 0.128,

c - x = 0.334.

But I don't know a, b, c, x, or the total pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the initial pressures are higher than the equilibrium pressures. For example, a = 0.116 + x,

Similarly, b = 0.128 + x,

c = 0.334 + x.

But then, the initial pressure would be a + b + c = (0.116 + x) + (0.128 + x) + (0.334 + x) = 0.578 + 3x.

But without knowing x or the initial pressures, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again.

The given equilibrium pressures are:

PCO = 0.116,

Cl2 = 0.128,

COCl2 = 0.334.

The reaction is CO + Cl2 ↔ COCl2.

The expression for Kp is (PCOCl2) / (PCO * Cl2) = 0.334 / (0.116 * 0.128) ≈ 22.42.

So, Kp ≈ 22.42.

Now, the degree of dissociation (α) can be found using the formula:

α = ( ( (P_CO_initial - P_CO_eq) ) ) / (P_CO_initial )

But without knowing P_CO_initial, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for α in terms of Kp:

α = sqrt( (1 - Kp) ) / (1 + Kp) )

But I'm not sure if this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the degree of dissociation can be calculated using the formula:

α = ( (x) ) / ( (a + b) )

where x is the change in pressure, a and b are the initial pressures.

But without knowing a and b, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

α = ( ( ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) ) - 1 ) ) / ( (0.334 / (0.116 * 0.128) )) )

But that would give me the fraction of the reaction that has occurred, but I'm not sure if that's the degree of dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the degree of dissociation is given by:

α = ( ( ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) ) - 1 ) ) / ( (0.334 / (0.116 * 0.128) )) )

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the fraction of the reaction that has occurred, which is x. Then, the degree of dissociation can be calculated using the formula:

α = x / (a + b)

But again, without knowing a, b, or x, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for α in terms of Kp:

α = sqrt( (1 - Kp) ) / (1 + Kp) )

So, Kp is 22.42.

So, 1 - Kp = 1 - 22.42 = -21.42.

So, sqrt(-21.42) is imaginary, which is not possible. So, that formula must be incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps the correct formula is:

α = sqrt( (1 - Kp) ) / (1 + Kp) )

Wait, but this gives a negative value inside the square root, which is impossible, so perhaps that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

α = ( ( ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) ) - 1 ) ) / ( (0.334 / (0.116 * 0.128) )) )

But that would give:

( (22.42 - 1) ) / 22.42 ) = 21.42 / 22.42 ≈ 0.956.

But this is just an approximation. So, the approximate degree of dissociation is 0.956.

But wait, that can't be correct because, for example, the degree of dissociation can't be greater than 1. But this is an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula:

α = ( ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) ) - 1 ) ) / ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) )

Which simplifies to:

(22.42 - 1) / 22.42 = 21.42/22.42 ≈ 0.956.

So, the degree of dissociation is approximately 0.956.

But wait, that seems high. Let's check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Compute Kp first:

Kp = 0.334 / (0.116 * 0.128) = 0.334 / (0.014848) ≈ 22.42.

So, Kp = 22.42.

Now, the degree of dissociation (α) is given by:

α = ( ( ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) ) - 1 ) ) / ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) )

Which is:

(22.42 - 1) / 22.42 = 21.42 / 22.42 ≈ 0.956.

So, α ≈ 0.956.

But, wait, that can't be correct because the sum of the percentages should be 100% plus the degree of dissociation. But 0.956 is more than 1, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Let me think of the degree of dissociation as the fraction of the initial pressure that has dissociated.

So, for example, if the initial pressure of CO was a, and Cl2 was b, then the initial pressure is a + b.

The change in pressure is x for CO and Cl2, and -x for COCl2.

So, the equilibrium pressures are:

PCO = a - x,

Cl2 = b - x,

COCl2 = (a + b) - x.

But in our problem, the equilibrium pressures are 0.116, 0.128, and 0.334.

So:

a - x = 0.116,

b - x = 0.128,

(a + b) - x = 0.334.

So, from the first equation, a = 0.116 + x.

From the second equation, b = 0.128 + x.

From the third equation, (a + b) = 0.334 + x.

But a + b = (0.116 + x) + (0.128 + x) = 0.244 + 2x.

So, 0.244 + 2x = 0.334 + x.

Subtract x from both sides:

0.244 + x = 0.334.

Subtract 0.244 from both sides:

x = 0.334 - 0.244 = 0.09.

So, x = 0.09.

Now, a = 0.116 + x = 0.116 + 0.09 = 0.206.

b = 0.128 + x = 0.128 + 0.09 = 0.218.

So, initial pressures:

PCO = 0.206,

Cl2 = 0.218.

So, initial total pressure is 0.206 + 0.218 = 0.424 atm.

Change in pressure x = 0.09 atm.

At equilibrium, COCl2 pressure is 0.334 atm.

Now, the degree of dissociation is x / (a + b) = 0.09 / 0.424 ≈ 0.212.

Wait, but this is inconsistent with the earlier calculation.

Wait, earlier I thought the degree of dissociation was 0.956, but this is 0.212.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, the degree of dissociation is the fraction of the initial pressure that has dissociated. So, for example, if the initial pressure of CO was 0.206 atm and Cl2 was 0.218 atm, then the total initial pressure is 0.424 atm. The change in pressure is 0.09 atm, which is the amount of CO and Cl2 that have reacted.

So, the degree of dissociation is x / (a + b) = 0.09 / 0.424 ≈ 0.212, which is approximately 21.2%.

But earlier, when I used the formula for α in terms of Kp, I got 95.6%, which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the degree of dissociation as x / (a + b) = 0.09 / 0.424 ≈ 0.212.

So, the degree of dissociation is approximately 21.2%.

But wait, then the degree of dissociation can't be greater than 1, but in this case, it's about 0.212, which is less than 1.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 0.212, which is approximately 21.2%.

So, the degree of dissociation is about 0.212.

Wait, but earlier, when I used the formula for α in terms of Kp, I got 0.956, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct approach is to compute the degree of dissociation as x / (a + b) = 0.09 / 0.424 ≈ 0.212.

So, the degree of dissociation is approximately 21.2%.

But let me check this.

Wait, another way to compute α is using the formula:

α = ( ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) ) - 1 ) / ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) )

Which is:

(22.42 - 1) / 22.42 = 21.42 / 22.42 ≈ 0.956.

But this gives α ≈ 95.6%, which is impossible because the sum of the partial pressures can't exceed 100% plus the degree of dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

α = ( ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) - 1 ) ) / ( (0.334) / (0.116 * 0.128) ) )

Wait, no, that would be (21.42 / 22.42) ≈ 0.956.

But this can't be correct because, for example, for a 1.00 pressure, the degree of dissociation can't be more than 1.00, but in this case, it's about 0.956, which is less than 1.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the formula is correct because the degree of dissociation can be up to 1, but in reality, it's less than 1.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The degree of dissociation is the fraction of the initial moles that have dissociated. So, for example, if you start with 1 mol of CO and 1 mol of Cl2, and 0.2 mol of COCl2, then the degree of dissociation is 0.2.

But in our problem, we have 0.206 mol of CO and 0.218 mol of Cl2, and 0.334 mol of COCl2.

So, the total initial moles are 0.206 + 0.218 = 0.424 mol.

The amount that has dissociated is 0.09 mol, as the initial was 0.206 and 0.218.

So, the degree of dissociation is 0.09 / 0.424 ≈ 0.212.

So, the degree of dissociation is approximately 21.2%.

So, the correct answer is 0.212.

But earlier, when I used the formula, I got 95.6%, which is incorrect.

So, to conclude, the correct degree of dissociation is approximately 0.212.
</think>

The degree of dissociation (α) for the reaction CO + Cl2 ↔ COCl2 is calculated as the fraction of the initial moles that have dissociated. The initial pressures are:

- CO: 0.206 atm
- Cl2: 0.218 atm
- COCl2: 0.334 atm

The total initial pressure is 0.206 + 0.218 = 0.424 atm. The change in pressure (x) is 0.09 atm, which is the amount of CO and Cl2 that have reacted. Thus, the degree of dissociation is:

α = x / (a + b) = 0.09 / 0.424 ≈ 0.212.

ANSWER: 0.212
