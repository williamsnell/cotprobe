Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about capillary rise. Hmm, I remember from my studies that capillary action has something to do with how liquid rises in a narrow tube. The question gives me the surface tension of water at 20°C, which is 72.62 dyn/cm. The diameter of the capillary is 1.0 mm. I need to find out how high the water will rise.

Wait, what's the formula again? I think it's something like the height (h) a liquid rises in a capillary is given by h = (2 * gamma * cos(theta)) / (r * rho * g). Wait, no, wait—actually, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, the Young’s equation for capillary rise involves the surface tension and the density of the liquid. So the correct formula should be h = (2 * gamma * cos(theta)) / (rho * d * g), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I might have seen it as h = (2 gamma cos(theta)) / (rho g r), where r is the radius.

Wait, let me get this right. The height of the rise depends on the surface tension, the density, the radius, and gravity. Since we're dealing with water, which has a density of 1 g/cm³, maybe that simplifies things. Also, surface tension is given in dynes per centimeter, so units are consistent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The formula for capillary rise is usually h = (2 γ cosθ) / (ρ g r), where γ is surface tension, ρ is density, g is acceleration due to gravity, r is radius, and θ is the contact angle. But wait, wait—another formula I've heard is h = (2 γ cosθ) / (ρ g r). So that's correct.

But wait, another thought—when water rises in a capillary, does it depend on the surface tension, the contact angle, and the radius. But wait, in the case of a capillary rise, the contact angle is typically considered to be zero because the liquid completely wets the surface. So cos(theta) would be 1. So that simplifies things.

So h = (2 gamma) / (rho g r). But wait, let me check the units. Gamma is in dyn/cm. So 72.62 dyn/cm. The density rho is 1 g/cm³. g is 980 cm/s², I think? Wait, no, wait, g in cm/s²: 980 cm/s² because 1 m/s² is 100 cm/s². So 980 cm/s².

Wait, but let me think about units. Let's calculate the units in which h is in cm, since the options are in cm.

So h = (2 * gamma * cos(theta)) / (rho * g * r). Substituting the values:

gamma = 72.62 dyn/cm
cos(theta) = 1 (since theta is 0)
rho = 1 g/cm³
g = 980 cm/s²
r = diameter / 2 = 1.0 mm / 2 = 0.5 mm = 0.05 cm.

So putting into the formula:

h = (2 *72.62 * 1) / (1 * 980 * 0.05 )

Calculating the numerator: 2 *72.62 = 145.24.

Denominator: 1 *980 *0.05 = 49.

So h = 145.24 / 49. Let me compute that.

145.24 divided by 49. 49 * 2 =98, 49*3=147. So 2 times 49 is 98. 145.24 -98 =47.24. 47.24 divided by 49 is approximately 0.964. So 2 +0.964= 2.964 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 2.96 cm. But I have 2.964, which rounds to 2.96 cm. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but wait—another thought. Maybe I forgot to account for the radius correctly. Oh wait, because the radius is 0.5 mm, so 0.05 cm. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Another possibility is that the height is h = (2 gamma cosθ)/(rho g r). As I did before.

Wait, but another version I've heard is h = (2 gamma) / (rho g r). Oh wait, no, that would be if the radius was used in the denominator with another factor. So no, I think the correct approach is as I did.

Another way to think about it: The height for capillary rise is related to the surface tension, gravity, and the radius. The formula is: h = 2 gamma / (rho g r). Wait, no, that's the same as what I did earlier—2*gamma/(rho g r). Or is it 2 gamma cos(theta) over (rho g r). But since theta is zero, cos(theta)=1, so it's 2 gamma/(rho g r). So that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

h = (2 *72.62) / (1 * 980 * 0.05)

So 2 *72.62 = 145.24.

Denominator: 980 *0.05 =49.

145.24 /49 = approximately 2.964 cm. So about 2.96 cm, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 2.96 cm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the units. Surface tension is in dynes per cm. So dynes are g cm/s², since 1 dyne = 1 g cm/s². So gamma is 72.62 (g cm/s²)/(cm) = 72.62 g/s², which is 72.62 cm/s² * g.

Wait, but maybe the formula is h = (2 gamma cosθ) / (rho g r). So substituting:

h = (2 *72.62 *1) / (1 g/cm³ *980 cm/s² * 0.05 cm)

Wait, wait, the denominator is rho (g/cm³) multiplied by g (cm/s²) multiplied by r (cm). So denominator unit is (g/cm³)(cm/s²)(cm) = g/(s²). Because:

(g/cm³) * cm/s² * cm = (g * cm²) / (cm³ * s²) )= (g * cm) / (cm³ s²) )= g/(cm² s²) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting the units wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value regardless of units because everything cancels out correctly. So yes, the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

So the answer is 2.96 cm, which is option G. So the correct answer is G.

To determine how high water rises in a capillary of 1.0 mm diameter, we use the formula for capillary rise:

\[
h = \frac{2 \gamma \cos(\theta)}{\rho g r}
\]

Here:
- \( \gamma = 72.62 \) dyn/cm (surface tension of water at 20°C),
- \( \rho = 1 \) g/cm³ (density of water),
- \( g = 980 \) cm/s² (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{1.0 \, \text{mm}}{2} = 0.5 \, \text{mm} = 0.05 \, \text{cm} \) (radius of the capillary).

Since water completely wets the surface (\( \cos(\theta) = 1 \)), the formula simplifies to:

\[
h = \frac{2 \gamma}{\rho g r}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
h = \frac{2 \cdot 72.62}{1 \cdot 980 \cdot 0.05}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \cdot 72.62 = 145.24
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
1 \cdot 980 \cdot 0.05 = 49
\]

Now, divide:

\[
h = \frac{145.24}{49} \approx 2.96 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, water rises approximately 2.96 cm in the capillary. Among the given options, this corresponds to **Option G (2.96 cm)**.
