Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the composition of a paint product. The question is about finding the weight ratio of BaSO4 and ZnS in the product when BaS reacts with ZnSO4. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to make sure I understand the chemical equation given. The equation is BaS + ZnSO4 → BaSO4 + ZnS. Wait, I think I should write this down to visualize it better. So, the reactants are BaS and ZnSO4, and the products are BaSO4 and ZnS. I think the arrow (ding{217}) means that the reaction is a synthesis reaction, so the products are the combination of the reactants.

Now, I need to find the molar masses of each product to find their weights. Let's calculate each.

For BaSO4: Barium sulfate. The atomic weights are:
- Ba: 137.33 g/mol
- S: 32.07 g/mol
- O: 16.00 g/mol (and there are 4 of them)
So, BaSO4's molar mass is 137.33 + 32.07 + (4 * 16.00). Let's compute that. 137.33 +32.07 is 169.4, plus 64 (4*16) is 233.4 g/mol.

For ZnS: Zinc sulfide. The atomic weights are:
- Zn: 65.38 g/mol
- S: 32.07 g/mol
So, ZnS is 65.38 + 32.07 = 97.45 g/mol.

So, the molar masses of the products are 233.4 g/mol for BaSO4 and 97.45 g/mol for ZnS.

Wait, but the question is about the weight ratio. So, it's BaSO4 to ZnS. Let me think about the stoichiometry of the reaction. The equation is 1 mole of BaS reacting with 1 mole of ZnSO4 to make 1 mole of BaSO4 and 1 mole of ZnS. So the mole ratio is 1:1 for both products.

So the molar masses would determine their weights. But wait, since each is 1 mole, the ratio of their weights is simply the ratio of their molar masses.

So, BaSO4 is 233.4, ZnS is 97.45. The ratio is 233.4 : 97.45. Let me compute that.

Divide both by 97.45. 233.4 / 97.45 is approximately 2.4 (since 97.45 *2 = 194.9; 233.4-194.9=38.5, which is about 0.4 *97.45). So 2.4 :1.

Wait, but when you have 233.4 and 97.45, dividing both by 97.45 gives:

233.4 /97.45 ≈ 2.4, and 97.45 /97.45 =1.

So the ratio is 2.4 : 1. That would correspond to option D, I think.

Looking back at the options: 

D is 233 : 97 or 2.4 :1. So that matches my calculation.

To determine the weight ratio of BaSO₄ to ZnS in the product, we first calculate the molar masses of the products. 

- **BaSO₄**: Ba (137.33 g/mol), S (32.07 g/mol), O (16.00 g/mol × 4).  
  Molar mass = 137.33 + 32.07 + 64 = 233.4 g/mol.  

- **ZnS**: Zn (65.38 g/mol), S (32.07 g/mol).  
  Molar mass = 65.38 + 32.07 = 97.45 g/mol.  

The reaction is 1:1 for the products, meaning equal moles of BaSO₄ and ZnS are formed. The weight ratio is the ratio of their molar masses:  

BaSO₄ : ZnS = 233.4 : 97.45.  

Dividing both by 97.45 gives approximately 2.4 : 1. This matches option D.
