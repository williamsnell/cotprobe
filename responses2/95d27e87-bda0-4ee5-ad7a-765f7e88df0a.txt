Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then I have to look at the options provided and pick the correct one.

Statement 1: "A homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone." Hmm, I remember from my notes that homomorphisms between groups have something to do with their kernels. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that map to the identity in the target group.

Wait, the statement says "if and only if." That means both directions must be true. So, the homomorphism is injective (one-to-one) exactly when the kernel is trivial (only the identity). I think this is correct because the First Isomorphism Theorem says that if φ: G → H is a homomorphism, then G / ker(φ) is isomorphic to the image of φ. If ker(φ) is trivial, then G is isomorphic to the image, which would make φ injective. And if φ is injective, then ker(φ) must be trivial because only the identity maps to the identity. So Statement 1 is true.

Moving on to Statement 2: "The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements." So I need to determine if there's a homomorphism from a group of order 6 to a group of order 4. Let's see.

The image of a homomorphism must be a subgroup of the target group. So what's the possible image size? The image is a subgroup of order 4, so the target group H must have a subgroup of order 4. What's the possible structure of H? Well, the order of H is 4, so it must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group Z4 or the Klein four-group Z2 × Z2.

Wait, but our original group G has order 6. So G is either cyclic (Z6) or the symmetric group S3, since 6 factors into 2×3, and S3 is the only non-abelian group of order 6.

So when we apply a homomorphism φ: G → H, the image is a subgroup of H. Let's see if H can have a subgroup of order 4. For H being Z4, the only subgroups are of order 1, 2, and 4. So yes, H can have a subgroup of order 4.

Now, can G map onto such a subgroup? Well, the order of the image must divide the order of G. Since G has order 6, the image's order must divide 6. So, for Statement 2 to be true, the image must have order 4. But 4 doesn't divide 6. Because 6 divided by 4 is 1.5, which isn't an integer. So that means the image cannot have order 4. Wait, wait, that's a contradiction. Wait what?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The image of a group under a homomorphism must have order dividing the order of the domain. So if G has order 6, the image must have an order that divides 6. So image size can be 1, 2, 3, or 6. So 4 isn't a possible image size in this case. Therefore, Statement 2 is false because the image can't have 4 elements.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought about the homomorphism being injective. No, because the image being of order 4 is impossible since 4 doesn't divide 6. So Statement 2 is false.

So to recap:

Statement 1: True (homomorphism is injective iff kernel is trivial by the isomorphism theorem).

Statement 2: False (image can't have 4 elements because 4 doesn't divide 6).

Now, looking at the options:

Options are A: False, True; B: False, False; C: True, True; D: True, False.

So the first statement is True, the second is False. So the correct option is D: True, False.

The analysis of the two statements leads us to the following conclusions:

1. **Statement 1** is **True** because a homomorphism is injective (one-to-one) if and only if its kernel is trivial (contains only the identity element). This follows from the First Isomorphism Theorem.

2. **Statement 2** is **False** because the image of a group of order 6 (which must divide 6) cannot have an order of 4. Since 4 does not divide 6, such a homomorphism is impossible.

Thus, the correct option is D: **True, False**.

Answer:
D: True, False
