Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve. The equation is x dy + (y - x e^x) dx = 0. Hmm, let me write that down properly. So, it's x dy + (y - x e^x) dx = 0. I need to find f(2) where y = f(x) satisfies this equation and y=0 when x=1.

Wait, I think I should rearrange this equation to recognize it as a linear differential equation. Let me try to express dy/dx. So, moving the terms around:

x dy = -(y - x e^x) dx
Divide both sides by x dx:
dy/dx = -(y - x e^x) / x
Simplify that: dy/dx = -(y/x) + (x e^x)/x → dy/dx = -y/x + e^x.

Okay, so that's a linear DE in the form dy/dx + P(x) y = Q(x). Let me rearrange it to match that. So, dy/dx + (1/x) y = e^x. Yeah, that looks right. So P(x) is 1/x, and Q(x) is e^x.

The integrating factor, μ(x), is e^(∫P(x) dx) = e^(∫1/x dx) = e^(ln x) = x. Multiply both sides of the DE by μ(x):

x dy/dx + y = x e^x

Wait, that's nice because the left side is the derivative of (x y). So, d/dx (x y) = x e^x.

Now, integrate both sides:

∫ d(x y) = ∫ x e^x dx.

The left side is x y. The right side requires integration by parts. Let me set u = x, dv = e^x dx. Then du = dx, v = e^x.

So, ∫ x e^x dx = x e^x - ∫ e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C.

So, putting it all together:

x y = x e^x - e^x + C.

Now, solve for y:

y = (x e^x - e^x + C) / x
Simplify: y = e^x (x - 1)/x + C/x.

Wait, or more accurately, y = [x e^x - e^x + C] / x = e^x (x - 1)/x + C/x.

Now, apply the initial condition y(1) = 0. Let's plug x=1 and y=0 into the equation.

At x=1, y=0:

0 = [1*e^1 - e^1 + C] / 1 → 0 = (e - e + C) → 0 = C.

So, C=0. Thus, the solution is y = [x e^x - e^x]/x.

Simplify that numerator: x e^x - e^x = e^x (x - 1). So,

y = e^x (x - 1)/x.

Which can also be written as y = (x-1) e^x / x.

Now, we need to find y at x=2.

Plug x=2 into the equation:

y = (2-1) e^2 / 2 = 1 * e^2 / 2 = e²/2.

Looking at the options, option D is e²/2.

So, the correct answer should be D.

To solve the differential equation \( x \, dy + (y - x e^x) \, dx = 0 \) with the initial condition \( y(1) = 0 \), we first rewrite it in standard linear form. Dividing through by \( x \, dx \) gives:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{x} y = e^x
\]

This is a linear differential equation with integrating factor \( \mu(x) = e^{\int \frac{1}{x} dx} = x \). Multiplying both sides by \( x \) and integrating:

\[
x \frac{dy}{dx} + y = x e^x \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d}{dx} (x y) = x e^x
\]

Integrating both sides:

\[
x y = \int x e^x \, dx
\]

Using integration by parts (\( u = x \), \( dv = e^x dx \), \( du = dx \), \( v = e^x \)):

\[
\int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - \int e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C
\]

Thus:

\[
x y = x e^x - e^x + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = e^x - \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{C}{x}
\]

Applying the initial condition \( y(1) = 0 \):

\[
0 = e^1 - e^1 + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = 0
\]

The solution simplifies to:

\[
y = e^x \left(1 - \frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{(x - 1) e^x}{x}
\]

Evaluating at \( x = 2 \):

\[
y(2) = \frac{(2 - 1) e^2}{2} = \frac{e^2}{2}
\]

The correct answer is:

**D: \( \frac{e^2}{2} \)**
