Question:

Which statement about the beak size of finches on the island of Daphne Major during prolonged drought is true?

Options:

A: Each bird's beak size increased due to the abundance of food during the drought.
B: Each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.
C: Each bird's beak became weaker and narrower as the drought persisted.
D: Each bird evolved a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.
E: Each bird's survival was not influenced by the depth and strength of its beak during the drought.
F: Each bird that survived the drought produced only offspring with deeper, stronger beaks than seen in the previous generation.
G: Each bird's beak size did not change during the drought.
H: Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.
I: Each bird's survival was only influenced by its ability to find water during the drought, not the size of its beak.
J: Each bird that survived the drought produced offspring with the same beak size as seen in the previous generation.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about beak size in finch species on Daphne Major during a prolonged drought. Hmm, I remember that beak size is related to diet and environmental adaptation. Let me think through this.

Droughts can affect the availability of food. Daphne Major probably relies on insects for food, right? So during a drought, fewer insects would be available. That means the beaks of the birds would need to be adapted to handle that. Beaks are adapted to their diet, so if the insects are scarce, the birds would need stronger, deeper beaks to dig harder and escape predators.

Looking at the options, option B says each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted. That makes sense because the drought reduces food availability, so the birds have to improve their beak for survival. They might have evolved a more robust beak to handle the reduced food supply. 

Option A suggests each bird's beak increased due to food abundance. Wait, the drought is the opposite of food abundance. So A is wrong because drought would mean less food, so beaks probably don't get bigger.

Option C says beaks became weaker and narrower. That doesn't fit. Droughts help the birds survive, so they'd likely need stronger beaks. Also, narrower beaks might allow them to dive, but I don't think that's the main point here. The main point is adaptation to the environment, so beaks should improve.

Option E says survival wasn't influenced by beak depth and strength. That's probably incorrect because beak adaptation is a survival strategy. So E is wrong.

Option G says beak size didn't change. That's not right because beaks have definitely evolved during droughts.

Option D talks about deeper, stronger beaks. That's similar to B, but D is more about evolution. So B is more about the immediate adaptation, while D is about the long-term evolution. The question is about the statement, which might be more about the immediate adaptation (B) or the long-term (D). 

Wait, the question is about the statement about the beak size during prolonged droughts. So the main point is that the beaks have become deeper and stronger. So option B is the correct answer. Option D might be a more accurate statement about evolution over time, but the question is about the statement about the beak size changes during the drought. So the direct adaptation is B.

Let me double-check. Droughts reduce food, so birds need to be better adapted. Deeper, stronger beaks are better at finding food. So yes, B is correct.

The correct answer is:

**B: Each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.**

During prolonged droughts, the availability of food is reduced. Birds on the island of Daphne Major, which presumably depends on insects for their diet, must adapt their beaks to handle this scarcity. Deeper, stronger beaks are adapted to dig harder and find food more efficiently. This adaptation is a direct response to the environmental challenge posed by the drought, making option B the most accurate statement about the beak size changes during droughts.

**Answer: B**
