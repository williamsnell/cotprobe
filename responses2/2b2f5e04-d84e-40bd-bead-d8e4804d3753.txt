Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about how the gene pool is altered. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question is asking which factors or processes can alter the gene pool. The options are A to J, each listing different methods.

I remember that gene pools can change through various mechanisms. Let's go through each option:

Option A: Cultural practices like selective breeding and dietary preferences. Selective breeding is a method where certain traits are selected, leading to changes in the gene pool. Dietary preferences might affect allele frequencies by influencing which individuals survive and reproduce. So this seems plausible.

Option B: Environmental changes alone. I'm not sure. Environmental changes, like climate shifts, can affect gene pools, but they might be more about the environment affecting allele frequencies, not the environment itself. Plus, I think natural selection and genetic drift are also factors.

Option C: Using pesticides and herbicides exclusively. That's about chemical use, which affects gene pools, but it's not the only method. Many other factors like selection or mutation also play roles.

Option D: Genetic engineering only. Well, genetic engineering can change the gene pool by introducing new genes, but it's not the only way. Many other methods like selection or mutation contribute.

Option E: Changes in solar radiation. Solar radiation affects organisms in ways that could influence gene pools, like affecting growth rates or survival, but this seems too direct and maybe not the most comprehensive answer.

Option F: Introduction of non-native species. This would definitely change the gene pool because new species bring new alleles. But is this the only way? No, as other factors are involved.

Option G: Extinction of certain species. This would remove genetic material, thus altering the gene pool. But extinction is a more drastic event and might not be the primary method.

Option H: Artificial selection by humans. Yes, humans can use selection to favor certain traits, altering the gene pool. But is it exclusive? No, selection is a broader process.

Option I: A variety of factorsâ€”mutation, natural selection, migration, genetic drift, meiotic drive. All these are well-known mechanisms that can change the gene pool. So this seems comprehensive.

Option J: Natural disasters. Natural disasters can affect gene pools, but they are not the only factor. They can be caused by various processes, not just natural disasters.

So, the question is asking which options describe ways the gene pool can be altered. The most comprehensive answer includes multiple mechanisms. Looking at the options, option I lists all these processes, which are all known to affect gene pools. 

Wait, but how about option F? If non-native species are introduced, that's a factor, but the question is about how the gene pool can be altered. So any of these methods are valid.

Looking back at the options, option I is the most accurate because it covers mutation, selection, migration, drift, and meiotic drive, which are all mechanisms that influence gene pools. 

Option H mentions human selection, which is part of artificial selection, but it's not the only way. So I is the best choice.

The correct answer is **I: The gene pool may be altered by factors such as mutation, natural selection, migration, random genetic drift, and meiotic drive.** These processes, collectively known as mechanisms of gene pool alteration, are fundamental to understanding changes in genetic populations. 

Option I encompasses mutation, natural selection, migration, genetic drift, and meiotic drive, all of which are well-established factors influencing gene pools. While other options describe specific methods (e.g., selective breeding, dietary preferences, environmental changes, etc.), they are less comprehensive or represent a subset of broader mechanisms. Therefore, option I is the most inclusive and accurate choice.

Answer: I
