Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the number of moles of hydrogen gas in a cylinder. Let's see, the cylinder is 50 liters, the pressure is 10 atmospheres, and the temperature is 27°C. Oh wait, and the gas constant R is given as 0.082 liter-atm per mole per Kelvin.

Hmm, right, I think this is a gas law problem. I remember the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Oh yeah, P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

So first, I need to make sure all the units are correct. The pressure is already in atmospheres, volume in liters, R is given, so I just need to convert the temperature to Kelvin. 

Temperature is 27°C. To convert that to Kelvin, I add 273.15, so that's 300.15 K. But maybe I can approximate it as 300 K if the calculation works out nicely, but I'll keep it precise for now.

Now, plugging into PV = nRT. Rearranging for n, I get n = PV/(RT).

So P is 10 atm, V is 50 L. R is 0.082, T is 300.15 K.

Let me compute the numerator: 10 atm * 50 L = 500 atm·L.

Denominator: 0.082 * 300.15. Let me calculate that. 0.082 * 300 is 24.6, and 0.082 * 0.15 is about 0.0123. So total is about 24.6 + 0.0123 = 24.6123. So denominator is approximately 24.6123.

So n = 500 / 24.6123. Let me do that division. 24.6123 goes into 500 how many times? Let's see, 24.6123 * 20 is 492.246. That's close to 500, so 20 would give 492, and 500 - 492.246 is about 7.754. So 20 + (7.754 /24.6123) ≈ 20.315 moles.

Wait, but let me make sure I did the division correctly. 500 divided by 24.6123. Let me think:

24.6123 * 20 = 492.246

500 - 492.246 = 7.754

So 7.754 /24.6123 = approximately 0.315.

So n ≈ 20.315 moles. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option H, which is 10. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, wait, no—wait, that's not right. 20.3 is not one of the options. Wait, looking at the options, the choices are up to 40. Let me check again.

Oh wait, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me recalculate.

I think perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me recompute R*T. R is 0.082, T is 300.15.

0.082 * 300 = 24.6. 0.082 * 0.15 is 0.0123. So 24.6 +0.0123=24.6123.

So the denominator is correct. The numerator is 10 *50=500.

n=500/(0.082*300.15) =500/24.6123≈20.315 moles.

Hmm, but none of the options is 20.3. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A:20

B:25

C:15

D:5

E:50

F:30

G:45

H:10

I:35

J:40

Wait, none of these are 20.3. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I switched liters and moles or something. Let me double-check the formula.

PV = nRT → n= PV/(RT). Yes, that's right.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the temperature was 27°C, which is 300 K, not 300 K? Oh wait, no, wait, I should add 273 to 27. So 27 +273=300 K. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I used 0.082 instead of the value for 0.082? Oh, wait, no, the question says R=0.082, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute 500/(0.082 * 300.15) more accurately.

Compute denominator: 0.082 *300.15= 0.082 *300 =24.6, plus 0.082 *0.15=0.0123. So 24.6+0.0123=24.6123.

500 /24.6123 = ?

Let me compute 24.6123 * 20 = 492.246.

500-492.246=7.754.

7.754 /24.6123 ≈0.315.

So 20.315 moles. But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let's see: perhaps the volume is in liters, and the units are correct. So pressure is 10 atm, volume 50 L, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be PV = n R T, but maybe it's using a different R value. Wait, R is 0.082 L atm/(mol K), so that's correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use R as 8.314 J/(mol K) instead? But the problem states R=0.082, so that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the pressure is 10 kPa or something else? No, the question says 10 atmospheres.

Wait, maybe the temperature was in Celsius. No, the question says 27°C, so that's 300 K, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the numbers. Let me compute 500 divided by 24.6123 more accurately.

500 /24.6123 = let me compute this on paper.

Wait, 24.6123 * 20 = 492.246

500 -492.246 =7.754

So 7.754/24.6123.

Let me compute this division.

24.6123 × 0.3 =7.38369

24.6123 ×0.31= 7.38369 + 2.46123=9.84492.

Wait, wait, wait, no, 24.6123 * 0.315 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 7.754 ÷ 24.6123.

Let me use approximate division.

7.754 /24.6123 ≈

24.6123 × 0.315 =?

24.6123 * 0.3 =7.38369

24.6123 * 0.015 =0.3691845

Sum:7.38369 +0.3691845=7.7528745.

Oh, that's almost exactly 7.754. So 0.315.

So 20.315 moles. But the options don't have that.

Wait, checking the options again. Oh, wait, the options are A to J, but in the original problem, perhaps the options are:

Wait, wait, looking back at the problem, the options are A H, G, etc. Wait, looking back, the user wrote the options as:

Options:

A: 20

B:25

C:15

D:5

E:50

F:30

G:45

H:10

I:35

J:40

So, the possible choices are 20, 25, 15, etc. So none of these is 20.315. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I've confused liters with something else. Let me think again.

Wait, another possible mistake: perhaps the pressure is 10 kPa, but no, the question says 10 atm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses R as 8.314 J/(mol·K) instead of 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K). But no, the question states R=0.082.

Wait, maybe the volume is 50 liters and the pressure is 10 atm, but the temperature is 27°C, which I converted to 300 K.

Wait, perhaps I should take the reciprocal. No, n is directly proportional to pressure and moles, inversely proportional to R and T.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should think in terms of the units. Let me verify the units again.

PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT).

P is 10 atm; V is 50 L.

R is 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K).

T is 300 K.

So, n = (10 *50) / (0.082 *300) → 500 / 24.6 ≈ approximately 20.315.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation once more.

Wait, 0.082 * 300 is 24.6, yes.

10*50=500.

500/24.6 ≈ 20.315.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But wait, perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, the cylinder is 50 liters. Maybe it's a pressure of 10 atm, so perhaps the pressure is correct. But wait, perhaps the question uses a different gas constant? Like, sometimes R is given as 8.314 J/(mol·K), but the problem states R=0.082, so that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pressure is in kPa, but no, the question says 10 atm.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for n.

n = (10 atm *50 L) / (0.082 L·atm/mol·K * 300 K).

So 10 *50 =500.

0.082 *300 =24.6.

500/24.6 = approximately 20.315.

So the answer should be about 20.3 moles. But the options don't have 20.3. So perhaps the options are incorrect, or I made a mistake. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should consider the molar mass of hydrogen. No, the question is about moles of H2. Wait, the problem says 'moles of hydrogen gas', so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are A:20, B:25, etc.

Since 20.3 is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 20. But looking at the options, option A is 20. So maybe the correct answer is A:20.

Wait, but I've got 20.3, but perhaps the problem expects rounding to the nearest whole number, which would be 20. So the correct answer would be A:20.

To determine the number of moles of hydrogen gas in the cylinder, the ideal gas law is applied: 

\[
PV = nRT \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

### Given Data:
- **Pressure (P)**: 10 atm  
- **Volume (V)**: 50 L  
- **Temperature (T)**: 27°C → \( 27 + 273 = 300 \, \text{K} \)  
- **Gas constant (R)**: \( 0.082 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

### Calculation:
1. **Numerator (PV)**:  
   \[
   P \times V = 10 \, \text{atm} \times 50 \, \text{L} = 500 \, \text{L·atm}
   \]

2. **Denominator (RT)**:  
   \[
   R \times T = 0.082 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \times 300 \, \text{K} = 24.6 \, \text{L·atm/mol}
   \]

3. **Moles (n)**:  
   \[
   n = \frac{500 \, \text{L·atm}}{24.6 \, \text{L·atm/mol}} \approx 20.315 \, \text{mol}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated value of \( n \approx 20.315 \, \text{mol} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **A: 20 moles**, which is likely the intended answer if rounding is considered.
