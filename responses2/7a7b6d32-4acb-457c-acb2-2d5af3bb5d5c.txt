Question:

An electrical transmission line is strung across a valley between two utility towers. The distance between the towers is 200 m, and the mass of the line is 40 kg.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a transmission line and a wave traveling along it. Hmm, let's try to break it down. 

Alright, the problem says there's a transmission line strung between two towers 200 meters apart. The line has a mass of 40 kg. A lineman strikes the line, a wave travels to the other tower, reflects, and the lineman detects it when the total time is 10 seconds. I'm supposed to find the tension in the wire. The options are all in the 10^2 N range, so I'm thinking I'll probably need to use the formula for wave speed on a string.

Wait, the basic formula for the speed of a wave on a string is v = sqrt(F/μ), where F is the tension and μ is the linear mass density. Oh, right, μ is mass divided by length. So, μ = m / L. Here, the mass is 40 kg and the length is 200 m. So μ would be 40 kg / 200 m = 0.2 kg/m. Got that.

The problem mentions a time of 10 seconds. But wait, the wave travels to the other tower and then reflects. So the total distance the wave travels is twice the length of the line. So distance is 2 * 200 m = 400 m. Time is 10 s. So the speed of the wave would be distance divided by time. So v = 400 m / 10 s = 40 m/s. 

Now, using the formula v = sqrt(F/μ), I can plug in the numbers to find F. Let me rearrange the formula: F = v² * μ. 

Let me compute that. V squared is 40^2 = 1600 m²/s². Multiply that by μ (0.2 kg/m), so 1600 * 0.2 = 320 N. Wait, that's 320 N, which is 3.2 × 10² N. Looking back at the options, option D is 3.2 × 10² N. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes in these problems, the time might involve the round trip, which I accounted for. Oh wait, the problem states that the time is 10s, which is the round trip time. So yes, the speed is 40 m/s, which is correct. So yes, F should be 320 N. So the answer is option D.

To determine the tension force in the transmission line, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Distance between towers: \( L = 200 \, \text{m} \)
   - Mass of the line: \( m = 40 \, \text{kg} \)
   - Total time for the wave to travel to the other tower and reflect: \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \)
   - Wave travels a round trip distance: \( 2L = 400 \, \text{m} \)

2. **Wave Speed Calculation**:
   - The wave travels a total distance of \( 400 \, \text{m} \) in \( 10 \, \text{s} \), so the speed of the wave is:
     \[
     v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{400}{10} = 40 \, \text{m/s}.
     \]

3. **Linear Mass Density**:
   - The linear mass density \( \mu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{m}{L} = \frac{40}{200} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/m}.
     \]

4. **Tension Force Calculation**:
   - Using the wave speed formula \( v = \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}} \), we solve for \( F \):
     \[
     F = v^2 \cdot \mu = (40)^2 \cdot 0.2 = 1600 \cdot 0.2 = 320 \, \text{N}.
     \]
   - Expressing this in scientific notation: \( F = 3.2 \times 10^2 \, \text{N} \).

5. **Answer Selection**:
   - The calculated tension force matches option D: \( 3.2 \times 10^2 \, \text{N} \).
