Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the initial length of the wire on the bobbin. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that a scientist measures the total resistance of the wire as 5.18 ohms. Then, he cuts off a 200 cm length and finds that the resistance of the remaining part is 0.35 ohms. We need to find the original length of the wire.

Hmm, I remember that resistance in a wire depends on its length and the material's resistivity. Oh wait, the formula for resistance is R = (resistivity * length) / area. So, R is proportional to length and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.

Wait, but the bobbin is cylindrical, so the cross-sectional area is constant along the length of the wire. That means the resistivity (rho) is same, and the area A is same for the entire length. So the resistance should be directly proportional to the length of the wire.

Wait, but in this case, the wire is cut into two parts. The first part is the entire length, and the second is 200 cm. The total resistance is R_initial = 5.18 ohms, and R_200 = 0.35 ohms.

But wait, according to the formula, R is proportional to length. So, R_initial = k * L_initial, and R_200 = k * L_200, where k is rho/A, a constant.

Wait, so if the second part is 200 cm, then k = R_initial / L_initial = R_200 / L_200. So, (R_initial) / L_initial = (R_200) / (200 cm).

But wait, wait. Let me make sure. Let me write down the equations.

Let me denote:

R_initial = 5.18 ohms = (rho * L_initial) / A.

R_200 = 0.35 ohms = (rho * 200 cm) / A.

Because the cross-sectional area A is the same, rho is same, so when you take R_initial and R_200, the A cancels out.

So, let's take the ratio of R_initial to R_200.

(R_initial) / (R_200) = ( (rho L_initial) / A ) / ( (rho * 200) / A ) ) = (L_initial) / (200 cm) * (A)/(A) ) = L_initial / 200 cm.

So, (5.18) / (0.35) = L_initial / 200 cm.

Calculating that ratio: 5.18 / 0.35.

Let me compute that. 0.35 * 14 is 4.9, which is less than 5.18. 0.35 * 15 is 5.25. So 5.18 is a bit less than 15. Let's see:

5.18 ÷ 0.35. Let me compute 5.18 / 0.35.

0.35 goes into 5.18 how many times? 

0.35 * 14 = 4.9 → 5.18 - 4.9 = 0.28. 0.35 * 0.8 = 0.28. So, 14 + 0.8 = 14.8.

So 5.18 / 0.35 = 14.8.

So 14.8 = L_initial / 200 cm.

So L_initial = 14.8 * 200 cm.

14.8 * 200 = 2960 cm.

Wait, but let me double-check. 14.8 * 200 is 2960 cm. So the initial length is 2960 cm.

Looking at the options, option J is 2960 cm. So the answer must be J.

To determine the initial length of the wire on the bobbin, we use the relationship between resistance and length for a cylindrical wire, where resistance is directly proportional to length and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Since the cross-sectional area and resistivity are constant, the resistance can be expressed as:

\[
R = \frac{\rho L}{A}
\]

For the entire length \( L_{\text{initial}} \), the resistance is \( R_{\text{initial}} = 5.18 \, \Omega \), and for the 200 cm cut-off portion, the resistance is \( R_{200} = 0.35 \, \Omega \). The ratio of the resistances is:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{initial}}}{R_{200}} = \frac{\frac{\rho L_{\text{initial}}}{A}}{\frac{\rho \cdot 200}{A}} = \frac{L_{\text{initial}}}{200}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{5.18}{0.35} = \frac{L_{\text{initial}}}{200}
\]

Calculating the ratio:

\[
\frac{5.18}{0.35} = 14.8
\]

Thus:

\[
14.8 = \frac{L_{\text{initial}}}{200} \quad \Rightarrow \quad L_{\text{initial}} = 14.8 \cdot 200 = 2960 \, \text{cm}
\]

Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 2960 cm**
