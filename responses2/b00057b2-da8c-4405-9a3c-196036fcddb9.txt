Question:

A restaurant used 231 eggs last week. Of these, 46 were brown in color. The remaining eggs were white in color. Which equation can be used to solve for w, the number of white eggs used last week?

Options:

A: w = 231 * 46
B: w = 231/46
C: 231+ 46w = 0
D: 46+w= 231
E: 231 = 46w
F: 231w = 46
G: 46 = 231w
H: w = 46 - 231
I: w= 231+ 46

Okay, so I have this problem here about a restaurant using eggs. Let's see... They used a total of 231 eggs last week. Out of these, 46 were brown in color, and the rest were white. I need to figure out which equation will help solve for w, the number of white eggs.

Hmm, the question is about setting up the equation. So, total eggs are 231, with 46 being brown. So the white ones must be the remaining eggs. I remember that when you have a total and some parts, you subtract to find the other part. So white eggs would be 231 minus brown eggs.

Wait, but let me think about the options given. The options are various equations. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: w = 231 * 46. That would multiply the total by the number of brown eggs, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for the remaining, not the product.

Option B: w = 231 / 46. That's the total divided by brown eggs. That's like saying each brown egg contributes a fraction of the total, which doesn't directly give the number of white eggs.

Option C: 231 + 46w = 0. That seems off because adding 231 and 46w would always be positive, which can't equal zero unless both are negative, but here we're dealing with positive numbers of eggs.

Option D: 46 + w = 231. Oh wait, that makes sense. Because if I add the brown eggs (46) and the white eggs (w) together, it should equal the total eggs (231). So this equation correctly sets up the relationship between the two quantities and the total.

Option E: 231 = 46w. That would mean the total is 46 times the white eggs. But that's not right because 46 is the number of brown, not the white. So this equation would give the brown eggs in terms of the total, which isn't what we need.

Option F: 231w = 46. That would mean the total multiplied by white equals the brown eggs, which doesn't make sense. It's the reverse and doesn't help in finding w.

Option G: 46 = 231w. Similar to D, this would express the brown eggs as a multiple of the white eggs, which isn't the case here.

Option H: w = 46 - 231. That would subtract the total from the brown eggs, which gives a negative number. Since we can't have negative eggs, this equation would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense.

Option I: w = 231 + 46. That would add the two quantities together, which would give a much larger number than the total. That obviously doesn't make sense.

So, going back, the correct equation is D: 46 + w = 231. Because when you add the known number of brown eggs (46) and the unknown white eggs (w), you get the total eggs used, 231.

The correct equation to find the number of white eggs (w) is:

46 + w = 231
