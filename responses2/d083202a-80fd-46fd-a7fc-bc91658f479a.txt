Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organizational development. The question is asking about the term for organizational development through a formally designed structure. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that organizational structures can be classified in different ways. I think there are a few main categories: functional, divisional, and formal structures. Formal structures have clear hierarchy and defined roles for each department or function. So that's probably one of the main options here.

The question mentions "formally designed" structures. I'm trying to recall the terms associated with different development approaches. Mechanistic development, processual, strategic, organic, etc. Mechanistic development is more about gradual changes that result from optimizing and improving processes. Processual is about changing processes to make them more efficient or effective. But I'm not sure if that's the term for formal structures.

Formal structures don't adapt on the fly; they're more rigid and stable. So if the structure is formally designed, maybe the development is called formal. Formal is one of the options (option C), so that seems likely.

I also remember terms like hierarchical, which refers to the division into levels, but that's more about structure type than development method. Organizational development methods include mechanistic and processual, which deal with gradual changes and process optimization.

Let me think about the other options. Strategic development is broader and involves long-term planning and vision, not necessarily about the structure type. Organic development is more about the growth of the company, I think. Operational refers to the day-to-day operations, which is more about how things are done rather than how they are structured.

So putting it all together, formal structure implies that the organization's structure is set in stone, and the development is done through a formal system. Mechanistic and processual are more about the methods of development, not the structure itself. So the term should be formal.

The correct term for organizational development through a formally designed structure is "Formal."
