Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find 3/4 minus 1/8. Hmm, let's see. I remember that to subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. So the denominators here are 4 and 8. I think I need to find a common denominator for these two. 

Wait, 8 is a multiple of 4, right? Because 4 times 2 is 8. So maybe I can convert 3/4 into eighths. Let's do that. 3/4 is the same as how many eighths? Well, each 1/4 is 2/8, right? So 3/4 would be 3 times 2, which is 6. So 3/4 is 6/8.

Now, the problem becomes 6/8 minus 1/8. Since the denominators are the same, I can just subtract the numerators. So 6 minus 1 is 5, and the denominator stays 8. So that gives me 5/8. Looking at the options, option A is 5/8. So I think the answer should be A.

Wait a second, maybe I should double-check. Let me add another way to confirm. Another approach is to convert both fractions to decimals and subtract. 3/4 is 0.75, and 1/8 is 0.125. Subtracting, 0.75 minus 0.125 equals 0.625. Now, what's 5/8 as a decimal? 5 divided by 8 is 0.625. Yep, that matches. So my answer of 5/8 is correct. So the correct option is A.

The correct answer is A: 5 over 8.
