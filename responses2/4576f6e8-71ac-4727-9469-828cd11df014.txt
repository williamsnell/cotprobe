Okay, so I've got this question about auditing and statistical sampling. Hmm, I should take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says: An auditor is using statistical sampling to test whether cash disbursements were properly authorized. The sample results show that the rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk is higher than the tolerable rate. Under these conditions, what's the auditor most likely to do?

The options are A through J. So I need to figure out which action the auditor would take next.

First, I should recall what statistical sampling entails. It's a method used in auditing to estimate the rate of deviation or other misstatements in a population. The auditor will use a sample to assess risk and determine if the findings are reasonable.

The scenario here is that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate. So, the tolerable rate is the maximum rate of deviation that the auditor is willing to accept. If the sum is higher, that means the sample shows more deviations than the tolerable level, plus the margin of error. So, that suggests that the sample is overestimating the actual deviation rate.

In such cases, the auditor's main concern is whether their conclusion is reasonable. If the calculated deviation rate plus allowable risk is above the tolerable, they need to adjust their assessment.

Wait, what are the steps in an audit process? So, the auditor's steps would probably involve risk assessment, sample selection, evaluation, and then adjusting the overall risk. 

In this scenario, the sum of the rate of deviation and the allowance is higher than the tolerable. So, the auditor probably has to reduce their overall risk assessment because the sample results indicate a higher risk than they can accept.

Looking at the options, option A is the overall risk assessment. So the auditor would probably adjust that. But what else? Let's see.

Option B: Planned reliance on the prescribed control. That's about whether the planned reliance on the control (like audit evidence) is appropriate. But in this case, the issue is with the deviation rate, so B might not be the immediate next step.

Option C: Tolerable rate of deviations. The question says the sum is higher than tolerable, so if they're reducing that, they might lower the tolerable rate, but the question is what the auditor is doing, not the result.

Option D: Assessed level of control risk. Control risk is the risk that the planned control might fail to prevent material misstatements. If the sample shows more deviations, maybe the control risk is too high. Wait, but the question is about the deviation rate. So perhaps the control risk is being assessed, but I'm not sure.

Option E: Use of statistical sampling. Well, the question states the auditor is using it, but it's likely they are adjusting their approach.

Option F: Assessed level of detection risk. Detection risk is about the risk of detecting a material misstatement if it exists. I don't think that's directly relevant here because the issue is deviation rate, not detection risk.

Option G: Level of inherent risk. Inherent risk is the risk that the inherent risk of the control is too high. If the sample shows too many deviations, maybe the inherent risk is too high, but the question is about the sum of deviation rate plus allowable risk, which is higher than tolerable.

Option H: Sample size. The question says sample size is being used, but the immediate action is about adjusting the overall risk assessment.

Option I: Period of time. No, that's about the duration, not the current assessment.

Option J: Planned reliance on substantive tests. That's about whether the planned tests for substantive testing are appropriate. I'm not sure if this is the next step.

Let me think about the process again. The auditor would start by evaluating the overall risk, which includes inherent risk, detection risk, and control risk. They use the sample to assess these.

If the sum of the deviation rate plus allowance is higher than tolerable, that means the sample results are more concerning than the tolerable rate. So they probably need to lower the tolerable rate. But the question is which of these options the auditor is most likely to reduce.

Looking back, the options are either the overall risk assessment, planned reliance on controls, tolerable rate, assessed level of control risk, etc.

Wait, the question is phrased as, the auditor is most likely to reduce which of the options. So the options are what they plan to do. So, when the sum is higher than tolerable, the auditor probably reduces the overall risk assessment. Because the tolerable rate is the maximum they're willing to accept, and since the sample is over, they have to adjust their assessment.

So the correct answer is option A, overall risk assessment.
</think>

The auditor's situation involves a sample where the rate of deviation plus allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate. This indicates that the sample results are higher than the tolerable level, prompting an adjustment in the overall risk assessment.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Scenario Analysis:** The sum of deviation rate and allowance is higher than the tolerable rate, suggesting the sample shows more deviations than the tolerable level plus risk. This calls for adjusting the risk assessment.

2. **Risk Assessment Impact:** Since the deviation rate is over the tolerable rate, the overall risk assessment must be reduced to ensure the findings are reasonable and not just due to sampling error.

3. **Evaluation of Options:** Among the options, reducing the overall risk assessment (Option A) is the immediate action needed. Other options like reducing tolerable rate or control risk are secondary considerations but not the immediate next step in this scenario.

**Answer:** A
