Okay, so I've got this question about relativistic equations and their application. Hmm, the question is about when these equations hold true. The options are A to J. 

Wait, what do I remember about time dilation, length contraction, and momentum-energy in relativity? Oh right, those effects become significant when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light. Because the formulas only approximate when speeds are much lower. So, when you're dealing with speeds near light speed, relativistic effects like time slowing down for a moving clock (time dilation), length getting shorter (length contraction), and energy increasing (momentum-energy) become important. 

So the question asks when these equations hold true. Oh, I think they are valid only at speeds near the speed of light. Because at everyday speeds, the effects are negligible. Like, for example, a car moving at 60 mph isn't close to the speed of light, so relativistic effects don't apply. 

Looking at the options again: option B says "at speeds near that of light." That sounds right. The other options don't make as much sense. Option C says "at everyday low speeds," which is opposite of what I'm thinking. Option D is "at all speeds," which isn't correct because the effects are much more pronounced at high speeds. 

Wait, what about the others? Option A talks about speeds a multiple of the speed of sound. That's way too slow. So no, that's not it. Option E says speeds below the speed of soundâ€”that's even slower. So B is the correct one. 

Another thought: why not option F? That's about "only approximately." But the question is about when they hold true. The equations themselves are only valid approximately at speeds near light speed. At rest, they'd be exact. But for practical purposes, especially in physics problems, they're only used when speeds are near light speed. So B is the correct answer.

The correct answer is **B: at speeds near that of light**. Relativistic effects like time dilation, length contraction, and momentum-energy become significant when speeds are close to the speed of light, as the formulas approximate their behavior at lower speeds. 

Answer: B
