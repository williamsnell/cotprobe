Okay, so I've got this question about the Articles of Confederation and their weaknesses, specifically relating to the options given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question asks about the major weakness of the Articles of Confederation. I remember that the Articles of Confederation were the predecessor to the United States, and they had several issues that led to the creation of the United States of America.

First, the options provided are A through J, each with a different weakness. Let's go through each one and see which fits best.

Option A: Makes it too difficult for the government to raise money through taxes and duties. I think that's true. The Articles of Confederation didn't have a strong central government to handle taxes and debt. They relied mostly on the state governments, which were weak and had their own methods. So raising money would be hard. That sounds like a significant weakness, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Did not include a provision for creating new states. Oh yeah, the Constitution does have a process for creating states, like the组成法. So the question is about the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, not their strengths. So this might not be the answer they're looking for.

Option C: Created a too-powerful chief executive. Wait, that doesn't sound right. The Articles of Confederation didn't have a strong national government. The central government was too weak because it didn't have a strong central authority. So the "powerful chief executive" might be a mischaracterization. I think this is incorrect.

Option D: Established a single, unified national identity too quickly. Let me think. The Articles of Confederation didn't have a strong national identity. The Constitution later introduced the concept of a national government, but the Articles of Confederation didn't have a national identity. So this might be a weak point, but I'm not sure if it's the most significant weakness.

Option E: Denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states. The Articles of Confederation didn't have a central government that could mediate. This made resolving disputes difficult because states couldn't just delegate their issues to a central authority. That's a valid point, but the question is about the major weakness, and option E is a separate point.

Option F: Granting too much power to the judicial branch. The Articles of Confederation's tax and debt collection methods didn't allow for a strong judicial branch. Also, the lack of a central government limited the power of the judiciary. This is a problem but perhaps not the most significant weakness.

Option G: Failed to establish a national currency. Oh, right! The Articles of Confederation didn't create a national currency. They relied on the state coins and notes for trade. So that's a weakness because without a national standard, money wouldn't be uniform, leading to issues like double standards in trade. This seems like a major point.

Option H: Did not include a mechanism for their own amendment. The Articles of Confederation didn't have a system for making changes. They just passed laws without a way to amend them. This limitation prevented the Articles of Confederation from adapting to new ideas, which was a significant weakness.

Option I: Did not provide for a national army or navy. That's true, but the weakness lies more in the lack of a national government, not the absence of specific institutions. So this is a point, but perhaps not the main issue.

Option J: Allowed for the unrestricted movement of goods and people between states. This seems unrelated to the structure; it's about freedom of movement, which the Articles of Confederation didn't protect.

So going back, the question is asking about the major weakness. The key weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation include:

1. Lack of a strong central government (no national identity, no strong central authority).
2. No way to raise taxes or pay debts (thus, unable to regulate the state).
3. Lacks a system for national defense or foreign policy.

The options list each point as separate, so which one is the major weakness? The question is about the weakness, and option G says it failed to establish a national currency. That's a significant issue because without a national currency, there would be double standards and economic instability. That's definitely a major weakness because if all states use the same currency, it's easier to enforce policies across borders.

Another point is option H, which is about amendment. Without a mechanism for amendment, the Articles of Confederation couldn't address political changes, but that was a limitation in its own right. However, the question is about the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation in their structure, not their political flexibility.

I think the major weakness is the lack of a national currency. So the correct answer is G.
</think>

The question concerns the major weakness of the Articles of Confederation. The key issue is the lack of a national currency, as this made it difficult to establish a uniform standard of value across the states. This weakness is significant because without a national currency, economic and political systems across different regions would be inconsistent, leading to potential double standards and economic instability. Therefore, the correct answer is G.

Answer: G
