Okay, so I have this problem here where Howard Travers bought some gasoline and I need to find the average cost per gallon. The question gives me the number of gallons bought at different prices and asks for the average to the nearest tenth of a cent. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should list out the details. He bought four different quantities and prices:

1. 10 gallons at 33.9 cents per gallon.
2. 14 gallons at 32.9 cents per gallon.
3. 12 gallons at 31.9 cents per gallon.
4. 8 gallons at 29.9 cents per gallon.

So, to find the average cost per gallon, I think I need to calculate the total cost and then divide it by the total number of gallons. That makes sense because average cost is total cost divided by total quantity.

Let me start by calculating each total cost individually.

For the first purchase: 10 gallons at 33.9 cents. So, 10 * 33.9 = 339 cents.

Second purchase: 14 gallons at 32.9 cents. So, 14 * 32.9. Hmm, let me compute that. 14 times 30 is 420, and 14 times 2.9 is 40.6. So 420 +40.6 = 460.6 cents.

Third purchase: 12 gallons at 31.9 cents. 12 *31.9. Let's see, 10*31.9 is 319, and 2*31.9 is 63.8. So 319 +63.8= 382.8 cents.

Fourth purchase: 8 gallons at 29.9 cents. 8 *29.9. 8*30 is 240, so 8*29.9=240 -0.8=239.2 cents.

Now, I'll add all these totals together.

339 + 460.6 = 799.6

799.6 + 382.8 = Let's see, 799 + 382 is 1181, and 0.6 +0.8 is 1.4. So 1181 +1.4= 1182.4.

Then, 1182.4 + 239.2 = 1421.6 cents.

Wait, let me double-check the addition:

339 (first)
+460.6 (second) → 339 +460.6 = 799.6
+382.8 (third) → 799.6 +382.8 = 1182.4
+239.2 (fourth) → 1182.4 +239.2 = 1421.6

So total cost is 1421.6 cents.

Now, the total gallons he bought is 10 +14+12+8.

10+14=24, 24+12=36, 36+8=44 gallons.

So, total gallons is 44.

Average cost per gallon is total cost divided by total gallons. So 1421.6 /44.

Let me compute that. 44 goes into 1421.6 how many times?

Well, 44 *32 = 1408 (because 44*30=1320, 44*2=88; 1320+88=1408).

Subtracting 1408 from 1421.6 gives 13.6 cents left.

Now, 44 into 13.6 is about 0.31 times (because 44*0.3=13.2, and 0.31*44=13.64). So approximately 32.31 cents per gallon.

Wait, wait, let me do this accurately. Let me compute 1421.6 ÷44.

Alternatively, I can compute 1421.6 ÷ 44.

I can also think of it as 1421.6 /44. Let me divide step by step.

44 into 1421.6.

Hmm, 44 * 30 = 1320. 1421.6 -1320=101.6.

44*2=88. 101.6-88=13.6. So far, 30+2=32, and there's 13.6 left.

Now, 44 goes into 13.6 how many times? 0.3 times because 44 *0.3=13.2. That leaves 0.4.

So, it's 32.3 + 0.3 =32.6? Wait, wait, no, because 0.3 is just the decimal, so 32.3 would give 13.2, but we have 13.6 left. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I should do this more carefully.

Wait, 44 * 32 is 1408. 1421.6 -1408=13.6.

So, 13.6 /44 = 0.309... So, approximately 32.309 cents per gallon.

Rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent, it's 32.3 cents.

Wait, but wait, let me check the division again because I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1421.6 /44 = ?

Let me compute 44 *32 =1408 as before.

So 1421.6 -1408=13.6.

So 32 + (13.6/44)=32+ 0.309=32.309.

So, 32.309 cents per gallon.

Rounded to the nearest tenth is 32.3 cents.

Looking at the options, that's option F: 32.3 cents.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are the calculations correct?

Wait, another approach: compute each total cost accurately.

10 gal at 33.9: 10 *33.9 = 339 cents.

14 gal at 32.9: 14 *32.9= 460.6.

12 gal at31.9:12 *31.9= 382.8.

8 gal at 29.9:8*29.9=239.2.

Adding them up: 339 +460.6 =799.6.

799.6 +382.8 = 1182.4.

1182.4 +239.2 = 1421.6.

Divide by 44: 1421.6 /44=32.309... which rounds to 32.3 cents.

So the correct answer should be F:32.3 cents.

The total cost is calculated by summing the costs of each purchase:

1. 10 gallons at 33.9 cents: 10 × 33.9 = 339 cents.
2. 14 gallons at 32.9 cents: 14 × 32.9 = 460.6 cents.
3. 12 gallons at 31.9 cents: 12 × 31.9 = 382.8 cents.
4. 8 gallons at 29.9 cents: 8 × 29.9 = 239.2 cents.

Adding these together: 339 + 460.6 = 799.6; 799.6 + 382.8 = 1182.4; 1182.4 + 239.2 = 1421.6 cents.

The total gallons purchased: 10 + 14 + 12 + 8 = 44 gallons.

Average cost per gallon: 1421.6 / 44 ≈ 32.309 cents, which rounds to 32.3 cents.

Answer: F: 32.3 cents.
