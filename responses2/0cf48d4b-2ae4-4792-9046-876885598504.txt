Question:

The owner of a large family estate decided to sell the property. The owner entered into a valid written brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. According to terms of the agreement, the broker promised to undertake best efforts to sell the estate for a purchase price of not less than $1,250,000. The contract also provided that the broker was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The brokerage agreement was effective for a period of two months. One month later, the broker notified the owner that she had found a buyer who wanted to purchase the property for $1,500,000. That same day, the broker handed the owner a real estate sales contract, signed by the buyer, in which the buyer agreed to pay $1,500,000 for the purchase of the estate. The owner investigated the buyer and discovered he had sufficient funds to purchase the estate. However, the owner changed his mind and decided not to sell the property. He told the broker that he would not sign the agreement. In addition, the owner told the broker that he was canceling their brokerage agreement because he was withdrawing the estate from the market. The owner also refused to pay the broker any commission. If the broker now sues the owner for breach of contract, which of the following, if anything, is the broker's proper measure of recovery?

Options:

A: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, plus punitive damages for breach of contract.
B: Nothing, because the owner has the right to withdraw the property from the market at any time.
C: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since all conditions precedent to the owner's duty to pay the commission were fulfilled when the broker produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to perform.
D: The broker can seek recovery for any expenses incurred during the process of finding a buyer.
E: Nothing, because a condition precedent, namely the consummation of the sale and transfer of title, has failed to occur.
F: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the consummation condition to the owner's duty to pay the commission was excused by the owner's refusal without cause to accept the buyer's offer and perform the land sale contract.
G: Quantum meruit for the reasonable value for services rendered in obtaining a buyer for the property.
H: $75,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$1,500,000, since the broker had obtained a buyer who was willing and able to purchase at a price higher than the minimum set in the brokerage agreement.
I: $62,500, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the original minimum sale price of the property for $1,250,000, since the broker had fulfilled her duty by finding a potential buyer.
J: A court injunction forcing the owner to complete the sale, thus entitling the broker to the full commission.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about a brokerage agreement. Let me start by reading the scenario carefully.

The owner of a family estate wants to sell it. They entered into a valid written brokerage agreement with a real estate broker. The agreement says the broker is to take best efforts to sell the property for at least $1,250,000. The commission is 5% on the gross sale price after the sale and transfer. The contract was effective for two months. Then, one month later, the broker told the owner that she found a buyer for $1,500,000. The owner accepted and signed a contract from the buyer, but the owner later decided not to sell and told the broker to cancel the agreement because he was withdrawing the estate. Also, the owner refused to pay any commission.

The question is about the broker's proper measure of recovery if they sue for breach of contract.

I remember that in contract law, certain conditions must be met before the seller can breach their obligation. The key here is the condition precedent, which is the successful completion of the sale and transfer of title. In this case, the broker had provided a buyer (the $1,500,000 offer) when the agreement was two months effective. But the owner canceled the agreement after one month, saying he wouldn't sign it because he wasn't going to accept the deal. So, the condition precedent (completing the sale) hasn't been met.

Wait, but there's a possibility that the owner's refusal is considered excused. For example, maybe the owner didn't know about the deal or the price, but the contract was effective. However, the owner's refusal to sign the agreement and pay the commission is an act of withdrawal without cause. But in terms of the condition precedent, the breach (the cancellation) happened after the condition had already been completed (the buyer accepted the offer). So, the condition precedent hasn't been met, so the owner's failure to accept the offer and pay the commission is a breach because the seller didn't provide a buyer, which is a breach of contract.

But wait, the initial agreement says the broker is to take best efforts to sell for at least $1.25M. The commission is on the sale price, which the owner paid $1.5M. So, the sale was at $1.5M, which is higher than the minimum. So the commission would be 5% of 1.5M, which is $75,000.

So, the owner's breach is that he didn't accept the offer and pay the commission. But since the contract was effective for two months, which includes the time the owner waited for the offer, the condition precedent was met. The owner's action was a breach because they didn't perform their obligations under the contract.

So, the proper measure for recovery would be the commission, which is $75k. Also, because the condition precedent (sale and transfer) wasn't completed (the owner didn't accept the offer), the contract was breached.

Looking at the options, option A says $75k, plus punitive damages for breach. Option D says the broker can seek expenses during finding a buyer. Option F says it's because the condition was excused by the owner's withdrawal. Option G is about quantum meruit, which is when the seller can get the price as if the buyer had made an offer. But in this case, the owner didn't accept the offer; he just refused to sign. So, I think option F is correct because the condition precedent was met when the offer was accepted, but the owner's action (canceling) is a breach upon failure to perform.

So, the correct answer should be F: $75k or the commission equivalent, because the condition precedent was fulfilled when the offer was accepted, but the owner failed to perform.

The question revolves around whether the owner breached the brokerage agreement by refusing to accept the buyer and paying the commission. The key issue is whether the condition precedent (completing the sale and transfer) has been met. The agreement was effective for two months, and the owner waited one month before canceling the contract. The broker provided the owner with an offer for $1.5M, which the owner accepted. However, the owner later refused to sign the contract and pay the commission, which constitutes a breach of contract.

The condition precedent (completing the sale and transfer) was already met when the owner accepted the offer, so the owner's refusal to perform is a breach upon failure to perform. The proper measure for recovery includes the commission of $75,000 (5% of $1.5M) plus any appropriate punitive damages.

Option F correctly identifies that the condition precedent was fulfilled when the offer was accepted, but the owner failed to perform, making it a breach. Other options either miscalculate the recovery or misinterpret the breach.
