Okay, so I've got this question about excess disability. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my psychology class that disability usually refers to symptoms that are related to a disease or condition. Like, if someone has a disorder, they might have certain symptoms. But excess disability is a bit confusing.

The question asks what excess disability refers to. So, excess would mean more than the normal or average. Like, maybe a person has more of a disability than others with the same condition. So, the first thing I'm thinking is, excess disability is when symptoms are more than normal. Like, if someone has a certain condition, and they develop more of the same physical symptoms, that's excess.

Looking at the options. Option C says "In excess of the average for that particular disorder." That makes sense because it's not due to the disease itself but more than usual. So that would be excess disability.

Option E says "Symptoms not related to any disease but due to a mental disorder." That's more about a mental health issue, not necessarily disability.

Option F talks about comorbid conditions. I'm not sure; excess disability is about the symptoms being excessive, not about comorbidities.

Option D is about symptoms as a side effect. That sounds like secondary effects rather than excess.

Option A is about social psychology, which doesn't directly relate to disability symptoms.

Option B is about age, but excess is about the severity, not just who has the condition.

Option G is about only after being cured. That doesn't sound right because even after a condition is cured, there might be new symptoms or exacerbations.

Option H is about chronic diseases. Excess could be part of chronic conditions, but again, it's not specific to that.

Option I is about being caught early. That's more about when treatment is effective, not about the symptom severity.

Option J is about Alzheimer's. I don't think that's directly related to the concept of excess disability in general.

So, putting it together, option C seems like the best fit because it's about the symptoms being excessive compared to the average. So I think the answer is C.

The correct answer is C: "In excess of the average for that particular disorder." This choice accurately describes excess disability as symptoms exceeding the normal average for a condition. 

Answer: C
