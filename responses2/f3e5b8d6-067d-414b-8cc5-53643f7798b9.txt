Okay, so I've got this question about motivation theories, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking which theory includes the key concepts of outcome, valence, and expectancy. Then, I need to explain each of these terms in the context of that theory and their practical implications for employee motivation.

First, I should recall what each of these theories is about. The options given are Two-factor, Self-Determination, Expectancy, Equity, Herzberg, Goal-Setting, Maslow, McClelland, Cognitive Evaluation, and Attribution.

I remember that outcome theory is one of the main theories, but I'm not too sure about the specifics. Outcome theory, from what I remember, focuses on the final outcome of an action. So, it's about what the employee gets as a result of their efforts. It's about the consequence of their behavior, not the effort itself. If the outcome is good, they feel satisfied. But wait, does it include valence and expectancy?

Wait, outcome theory might refer to the various factors that influence the outcome. So, maybe it's the broader theory encompassing these concepts. But I'm not sure if that's the one the question is referring to. The question specifies that the key concepts are outcome, valence, and expectancy. That makes me think it's a specific theory where these are central, not just a broader concept.

Looking at the options again, Expectancy Theory is one of them. Expectancy Theory, if I recall correctly, looks at the expectation of a relationship between the employee's behavior and the outcome. It suggests that employees are motivated by the belief that if they take certain actions, they will achieve a desired outcome. So, the key idea here is that their behavior predicts an outcome, which is called the expectation. So, in this theory, the key concepts would include the expectation, valence (the value that the employee expects from the outcome), and the outcome (what actually happens).

But wait, the question is about which theory includes these concepts. So, the theory that includes these as key elements. Expectancy Theory is about the expectation of an outcome given a behavior. So, perhaps it's the theory that includes these three concepts.

Let me think about the other theories. 

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is about providing a sense of purpose and security. It includes concepts like autonomy, consequence, and relatedness. I don't think it directly ties to outcome, valence, and expectancy.

Equity Theory deals with fairness and justice in workplace relationships. It's more about fairness and justice, so it doesn't directly use the three concepts mentioned.

Herzberg's Theory, also known as the two-factor theory, looks at intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. It breaks down into two factors that contribute to motivation: the amount of work they have to do and the control they have over their work. It's more about motivation types rather than specific theoretical constructs.

Goal Setting Theory is about setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals. While it's part of motivation, I'm not sure if it includes the three mentioned concepts. I think it's more about setting goals than explaining outcome, valence, or expectation.

Cognitive Evaluation Theory looks at how employees evaluate their own performance. It's more about how people perceive their worth and how that affects their motivation. I don't think it's directly about the three concepts in question.

Cognitive Dissonance Theory is about discomfort when there's a conflict between what someone expects and what's actually happening. It's more about how people feel when there's a mismatch, so I don't think it's the answer.

Attribution theory is about who is responsible for an outcome. It includes internal (within-group) and external (external-group) attribution. I don't think it's about the three concepts here.

So, going back, the theory that includes outcome, valence, and expectation is Expectancy Theory. This theory posits that employees are motivated by the expectation that a certain outcome will result from a particular behavior. So, the key concepts in this theory are expectation (the belief about the outcome), valence (the actual value the employee expects), and outcome (what happens as a result of their behavior).

Now, the practical implications for employee motivation under this theory would be that employees are more likely to take on tasks if they believe that their actions will lead to a favorable outcome. This theory emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between the employee's behavior and the outcome, so companies might structure their workplaces to encourage employees to set goals and take ownership of their achievements. It also believes that employees have a stake in their own success, which can drive higher motivation.

Wait, but the question specifically mentions outcome, valence, and expectation. So, in Expectancy Theory, the three terms are: outcome (the result of their actions), valence (the expectation of that outcome), and expectation (the belief that their actions will lead to that outcome). So, this theory aligns with these concepts.

The practical implications are about how to encourage employees to take on more responsibility and to align their actions with what they expect. Companies might focus on providing clear performance expectations, setting clear goals, and fostering a positive work environment.

I think that makes sense. So, the answer should be Expectancy Theory (option C), and the practical implications would revolve around employees being motivated by the expectation of a favorable outcome, valuing the expectation (valence), and the actual result being what they expect (outcome).

The correct answer is C: Expectancy Theory.

### Explanation:

**Expectancy Theory** is the theory that includes the concepts of outcome, valence, and expectation. This theory posits that employees are motivated by the expectation that a particular outcome will result from their actions. 

- **Expectancy (E):** This refers to the belief that the actions of an employee will lead to a desired outcome. It's the foundation of motivation, as employees are motivated by the expectation that their actions will result in a specific outcome.
- **Valence (V):** This is the actual value or expectation that the employee expects from the outcome. It represents what the employee believes will happen as a result of their actions.
- **Outcome (O):** This is the result of the employee's actions. The theory emphasizes that the employee is motivated by the expectation (E) and the actual outcome (O). 

### Practical Implications:
- **Encourages Employee Responsibility:** Employees are more likely to take on tasks if they believe that their actions will lead to a favorable outcome.
- **Focus on Performance Goals:** Companies should structure their workplace to encourage employees to set and achieve measurable, achievable goals.
- **Stakeholder Motivation:** Employees have a stake in their own success, which can drive higher motivation.
