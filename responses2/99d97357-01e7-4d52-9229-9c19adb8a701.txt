Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says: 2 moles of an ideal gas are expanded reversibly and isothermally at 0°C from 1 atm. The heat absorbed during the process is 1 = 750 cal. I need to find the final volume it occupies. The options are A through J, but I should calculate the exact value and see which option matches.

First, I remember that for an isothermal process, the internal energy change (ΔU) is zero because the temperature doesn't change. So the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = q + w, becomes 0 = q + w. That means q = -w. Wait, but wait, wait. In some conventions, work done by the system is considered positive, so if the gas expands, it does work on the surroundings. So if the gas is expanding, it's doing work, so w would be negative (-w is the work done on the system). But since heat is absorbed (q positive), then q = -w implies that w is negative. So maybe I should be careful about the signs.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of heat and work. So, q is the heat absorbed, which is 750 cal. Since the process is isothermal, the heat absorbed q is equal to the work done by the gas. So, q = w. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The first law says ΔU = q + w. For an isothermal process, ΔU is zero, so q = -w. That means that if the gas expands (work done by the system is positive), then q would be negative because w is positive. But wait, in the problem statement, it's said that heat is absorbed, so q is positive. That must mean that the work done by the gas is negative, which would mean that the gas is doing work on the surroundings.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. For an isothermal reversible expansion, the heat absorbed (q) equals the work done by the gas (w). So q = w. But if w is positive (work done by the gas), then q is positive. So in this case, q is 750 cal, which equals the work done by the gas.

So, the work done (w) is 750 cal. Now, the work done during an isothermal reversible expansion is given by w = nRT ln(V2/V1), assuming that V2 > V1 (expansion). Wait, but wait, let's get the formula right. The formula is w = nRT ln(V_final / V_initial). But I need to make sure I remember the signs. Since it's expansion, the system is doing work, so the work is positive, so the formula would be w = nRT ln(V2/V1), and since V2 > V1, the ln is positive, so w is positive, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that q = w.

But wait, wait. The problem states that the heat absorbed is 750 cal. So q = 750 cal. And the work done by the gas is w = 750 cal as well.

But wait, the formula for work done by the gas during isothermal expansion is w = nRT ln(V2/V1). So, let's plug the numbers in.

First, let me note down the given data:

n = 2 moles
T = 0°C. Oh, wait, that's 273.15 K.
q = 750 cal.
R is the gas constant. But wait, in the formula, R is in appropriate units. Since the heat is given in calories, I think R has to be in cal/(mol·K).

Wait, I remember that R is approximately 237.14 cal/(mol·K). Alternatively, I've also seen R as 8.314 J/(mol·K), but in this case, it's better to use R in cal units.

But wait, another point. The formula uses the natural logarithm. So I need to calculate ln(V2/V1). But wait, I don't know V1 or V2. Hmm, but maybe I can find an alternative approach.

Wait, but I don't have the initial volume. Oh wait, the initial pressure is 1 atm, and the process is at 0°C. So initially, it's 1 atm, so using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Let me write that.

Initially, P1 = 1 atm, V1 = ? , T = 273.15 K, n=2.

So, P1 V1 = n R T1, but again, R is in cal/(mol·K). Alternatively, let's express everything in terms of R.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the final volume in terms of the initial volume. Let me think.

Wait, but since the process is isothermal, the ideal gas law can be written as P1 V1 = P2 V2. Because temperature is constant, so P1 V1 = n R T = P2 V2. So P1 = 1 atm, V1 is the initial volume, P2 is the final pressure, V2 is the final volume.

But we don't have P2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate Q and W. Since q = w, and q is 750 cal, so w is 750 cal.

So, w = n R T ln(V2/V1) = 750 cal.

Wait, but I don't know V2 yet, so perhaps I can express V2/V1 in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express V2 in terms of V1 using the ideal gas law.

Wait, but without knowing anything else, perhaps I can relate V1 and V2.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that in an isothermal process, Q = W. So, q = w = 750 cal.

So, let me write out the equation: 750 cal = (2 mol)(R)(273.15 K) ln(V2/V1).

But wait, I'm not sure what R is in cal units. Let me double-check: R is 237.14 cal/(mol·K). Yes, that's right.

So, let me compute R*T: 237.14 cal/(mol·K) * 273.15 K = ?

Calculating that: 237.14 * 273.15.

Wait, 237 * 273 is about 65,000? Let me compute it accurately.

237.14 * 273.15.

Well, 237 * 273 = 237 * 200 = 47,400; 237 *73= 17,301. So 47,400 + 17,301 = 64,701. But wait, since it's 273.15, let's compute 237.14 * 273.15.

But perhaps an easier way is to compute R*T as 237.14 * 273.15 = let's think:

237.14 * 273.15 → Let me compute 237 * 273 = 237*(270+3) = 237*270= 64,  237*270= 64,  let's compute it properly.

Wait, 237 * 200 =47,400. 237 *70= 16,590. 237 *3=711. So 47,400 +16,590=63,990 +711=64,701.

But then, the actual value is 237.14 *273.15= approximately 237.14 *273.15 = 64,680 cal·something? Actually, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 237.14 * 273.15.

But perhaps for this problem, the exact calculation may not be necessary because the numbers will cancel out in the logarithm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for work done in isothermal expansion, which is w = nRT ln(V2/V1). But since q = w, and q is 750 cal, then:

750 = (2)(R)(273.15) ln(V2/V1)

But I'm not sure about R's units. R is 237.14 cal/(mol·K). So R*T is 237.14 * 273.15 = let's compute this.

Let me compute 237.14 * 273.15.

Well, 237 * 273 = 64,701 as before. But let's calculate 237.14 * 273.15.

Wait, perhaps 273.15 is 273 + 0.15. So 237.14 * 273 = 64,701.22 (since 237.14 * 200 =47,428; 237.14 *70=16,599.8; 237.14*3=711.42 → 47,428 +16,599.8=64,027.8 +711.42=64,739.22). Then 0.15 * 237.14 = 35.571. So total is 64,739.22 +35.571=64,774.79 cal.

So R*T =64,774.79 cal/mol. Wait, but that seems high. Wait, 237.14 * 273.15.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

237.14 × 273.15 = ?

Let me compute 237.14 × 273.15.

237.14 × 200 = 47,428.

237.14 × 70 = 16,599.8.

237.14 × 3 = 711.42.

237.14 × 0.15 = 35.571.

Adding all together: 47,428 +16,599.8 = 64,027.8; +711.42 =64,739.22; +35.571 =64,774.792 cal.

So R*T is 64,774.79 cal/(mol·K) * K = 64,774.79 cal/mol.

So, 750 = 2 *64,774.79 * ln(V2/V1)

Wait, wait, wait. No, the formula is q = n R T ln(V2/V1). So q is 750 = 2 * 64,774.79 * ln(V2/V1).

Wait, no—n is 2, so 2 * 64,774.79 is 129,549.58 cal/(mol). So 750 = 129,549.58 * ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but 750 is much smaller than 129,549.58. So ln(V2/V1) = 750 / 129,549.58 ≈ approximately 0.0058.

So ln(V2/V1) ≈ 0.0058.

Then, V2/V1 = e^0.0058 ≈ 1.0058. So V2 ≈ V1 *1.0058.

But wait, then the volume increases by about 0.58% from the initial volume. But that seems small. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can use the formula for the work done in an isothermal reversible expansion. Let me recall the formula:

w = nRT ln(V2/V1)

But wait, in this case, the system is doing work, so the work is positive. So since q = w, q is positive 750 cal, so w is 750 cal.

So, 750 cal = 2 * R * 273.15 * ln(V2/V1).

Wait, R is 237.14 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15 K. So R*T = 237.14 * 273.15=64,774.79 cal/(mol).

So, 750 = 2 * 64,774.79 * ln(V2/V1).

Which is 750 = 129,549.58 * ln(V2/V1).

So ln(V2/V1) = 750 / 129,549.58 ≈ 0.0058.

So, V2/V1 = e^0.0058 ≈ 1.0058.

So V2 = V1 *1.0058. So the volume increases by about 0.58% from the initial volume.

But wait, then I don't know V1. How can I find V1?

Wait, perhaps I can use the ideal gas law at the initial state. The initial pressure is 1 atm, T is 273.15 K, n=2.

So P1 V1 = n R T → 1 atm * V1 = 2 * 237.14 cal/(mol·K) * 273.15 K.

Wait, wait, let me compute this.

R is in cal/(mol·K). So, the units for PV are in cal. Because R is in cal/(mol·K).

So, 1 atm * V1 (in liters?) = 2 * 237.14 cal/(mol·K) * 273.15 K.

Wait, so PV = nRT → V1 = (nRT)/P.

But wait, n=2, R=237.14 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15 K. P=1 atm.

But I need to make sure of the units. Because R is in cal/(mol·K), so the units will be in liters because 1 atm·L = 1 cal.

Wait, yes, because 1 L·atm ≈ 1 cal. So, when pressure is in atm and volume in liters, the product PV is in cal.

So, V1 = (2 * 237.14 * 273.15) / 1.

Calculating that:

237.14 * 273.15 = 64,774.79 cal/mol (as before). Multiply by 2: 129,549.58 cal.

So V1 = 129,549.58 cal / 1 atm = 129,549.58 liters·atm / atm = 129,549.58 liters.

Wait, that's a huge volume! 129,549.58 liters is about 129.549 cubic meters or 129,549 liters. That's a very large volume; maybe I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should have used R in J/(mol·K) and converted to cal. Let me try that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use R in cal/(mol·K) and the volume in liters.

Wait, another approach: The initial volume V1 can be found using the ideal gas law.

PV = nRT → V1 = (n R T) / P.

n=2, R=237.14 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15 K, P=1 atm.

So, V1 = (2 * 237.14 * 273.15) / 1.

Which is again 64,774.79 cal/(mol·K) * 237.15 K → wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Wait, 237.14 cal/(mol·K) * 273.15 K = 64,774.79 cal/mol.

Then, 2 (mol) * 64,774.79 cal/mol = 129,549.58 cal.

So V1 = 129,549.58 cal / 1 atm = 129,549.58 liters·atm / atm → 129,549.58 liters.

Wait, that's 129,549.58 liters. That's about 129.55 cubic meters, which is 129,550 liters. That's a huge volume. But the heat absorbed is only 750 cal.

Wait, wait, but R is 237.14 cal/(mol·K), so for each mole, R*T is 237.14 * 273.15 = 64,774.79 cal/mol. So when you have 2 moles, it's 129,549.58 cal.

So, V1 is 129,549.58 liters. That's a huge volume, but maybe I'm right. Because for a small amount of gas (2 moles), at 273 K, and 1 atm, that's a huge volume.

Wait, but if I have 2 moles in a volume of 129,549.58 liters, that's 129.549 cubic meters, which is 129,549 liters. Okay.

So, now, we have V1 = 129,549.58 liters, and V2 = V1 *1.0058 ≈ 129,549.58 *1.0058 ≈ 130,187 liters. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute V2.

Wait, earlier we found that V2/V1 ≈ 1.0058, so V2 = V1 *1.0058. Given V1 = 129,549.58 liters, V2 is 129,549.58 * 1.0058 ≈ let's compute that.

129,549.58 * 1.0058 = 129,549.58 * (1 + 0.0058) = 129,549.58 + (129,549.58 * 0.0058).

Calculating 129,549.58 * 0.0058: 129,549.58 * 0.005 = 647.7479, and 129,549.58 *0.0008=103.639664. Adding these together: 647.7479 +103.639664 ≈751.387564.

So, V2 ≈129,549.58 + 751.387564 ≈130,300.97 liters.

Wait, but that's a little over 130,300 liters. But wait, that's the volume after expansion. But earlier when I calculated the ratio of V2/V1, I found it's about 1.0058, meaning a volume increase of 0.58%.

But wait, that seems too small. Because in that case, the volume would have a tiny increase, but the initial volume is so large. Let me think again about the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ln(V2/V1). Let me go back.

We have 750 cal = n R T ln(V2/V1).

So, ln(V2/V1) = 750 / (n R T).

n=2, R=237.14, T=273.15.

So, 750 / (2 * 237.14 * 273.15) )= 750 / (129,549.58) ≈0.0058.

Then V2/V1 = e^0.0058 ≈1.0058.

So, ln(1.0058) ≈0.0058.

So, V2/V1 =1.0058.

So, V2= V1 *1.0058.

But wait, what is V1 in liters? Because PV= nRT → V1= (nRT)/P.

n=2, R=237.14 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15 K, P=1 atm.

So, V1= (2 * 237.14 * 273.15) /1.

As we calculated, that's 129,549.58 liters.

So, V2=129,549.58 *1.0058 ≈130,300.97 liters.

Wait, but then the increase is about 760 liters (130,300.97 -129,549.58=751.39 liters). So, a 751.39 liter increase from 129,549.58 liters.

But wait, this seems too small a volume change. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for the change in volume after expansion. Since the process is isothermal, the change in volume is given by:

V2 = V1 * (n T / (P V)) ) ??? No, perhaps I should think in terms of the work done.

Wait, another approach: Since q = w =750 cal, and for an ideal gas, the work done during isothermal expansion is given by w = n R T ln(V2/V1).

But perhaps I can use the formula for the change in volume in terms of the heat absorbed.

Wait, another thought: The heat absorbed by the gas is related to the work done. Since the gas is expanding, the heat absorbed is equal to the work done. So, for an isothermal process, the heat absorbed is equal to the work done.

Wait, the first law says ΔU = q + w. But in an isothermal process, ΔU =0 because temperature is constant. So, q = -w.

But wait, in this case, the gas is expanding, so the work done by the gas is positive. So, q is positive and equal to the work done by the gas. So, q = w.

So, for an isothermal process, q = n R T ln(V2/V1).

So, 750 = 2 * R * 273.15 * ln(V2/V1).

Wait, R is 237.14 cal/(mol·K), so 2 * 237.14 = 474.28 cal/(mol).

So, 750 = 474.28 * 273.15 * ln(V2/V1).

Wait, no. Wait, 2 * R is 474.28 (cal/(mol)), and T is 273.15 K.

So, 474.28 * 273.15 = let's compute that.

474 *273 = 129,  let me compute 474 * 273.

Wait, 474 *273 = (500 -26) *273 = 500*273 =136,500 minus 26*273.

26 *273= 7, 26 *270= 7, 26 *3=78 → 26*273=7, 26*270=7, 78= 26*270 +26*3=7, 78 → 7, 26*270= 7, 78? Wait, 26 *270 = 7,  ?

Wait, 26 *270= 26*200=5,200; 26*70= 1,820 → 5,200 +1,820=7,020.

Then 26*3=78 → 7,020 +78=7,098.

So, 474 *273= 136,500 (from 500*273) minus 7,098 → 136,500 -7,098=129,402.

But wait, 474.28 *273.15 is more precise. So, 474.28 *273.15 =?

Let me compute 474.28 *273.15.

Well, 474.28 *200 =94,856.

474.28 *70 =33,200 (since 474.28 *7=3,319.96 → 3,319.96 *10).

474.28 *3=1,422.84.

474.28 *0.15=71.142.

Adding all of these:

94,856 (from 200) +33,200 (from70) =128,056; +1,422.84 (from3) =129,478.84; +71.142 (from0.15) →129,550. (approx.)

So, 474.28 *273.15 ≈ 129,550.

So, 750 =129,550 * ln(V2/V1).

So, ln(V2/V1) =750 / 129,550 ≈0.0058.

So, V2/V1 = e^0.0058 ≈1.0058.

So, V2 = V1 *1.0058.

But V1 is 129,549.58 liters, so V2=129,549.58 *1.0058 ≈130,300.97 liters.

Wait, but this is a huge volume. Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of R*T?

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for work correctly.

Wait, the work done during isothermal expansion is:

w = nRT ln(V2/V1).

Yes, that's correct. So, if q =w, then q = nRT ln(V2/V1).

So, 750 = 2 * R * 273.15 * ln(V2/V1).

Wait, R is 237.14 cal/(mol·K). Let's recalculate 2 * R * T.

2 * 237.14 =474.28.

474.28 *273.15=129,550.

So, 750=129,550 * ln(V2/V1).

So, ln(V2/V1)=750/129550 ≈0.0058.

So, V2/V1= e^0.0058≈1.0058.

So, V2=129,549.58 *1.0058 ≈130,300 liters.

Wait, but this is a very large volume. Let me think if I can find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the work done in an isothermal process without using R, but using the ideal gas law in terms of pressure.

Wait, another approach: Use the ideal gas law to find the initial volume, then use the work formula.

So, initial state: P1=1 atm, V1= ?, T=273.15 K, n=2.

Using PV = nRT → V1 = (nRT)/P.

n=2, R=237.14 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15, P=1 atm.

So, V1 = (2 * 237.14 *273.15)/1 = 129,549.58 liters.

So, initial volume is 129,549.58 liters.

Then, the final volume is V2 = V1 * 1.0058 ≈130,300 liters.

Wait, but the options are 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. None of these are even close to 130,300. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the question is not in liters, but in another unit, but I assumed that it's in liters. Maybe it's in cubic meters. Let me check.

Wait, 1 liter = 0.001 cubic meters. So, 129,549.58 liters =129.54958 cubic meters.

So, V1=129.54958 m³.

Work done is w = nRT ln(V2/V1).

So, 750 cal = 2 * 237.14 * 273.15 * ln(V2/V1).

Compute 2 *237.14=474.28.

474.28 *273.15=129,550.

So, 750=129,550 * ln(V2/V1).

So, ln(V2/V1)=750/129550≈0.0058.

So, V2/V1=1.0058.

V2=129.54958 *1.0058≈130.30 m³.

Hmm, but the options are all in hundreds. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is using kJ instead of cal. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written in cal. So, perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R=8.314 J/(mol·K) instead of cal. Let me try that approach.

Wait, but then the units would be in joules. So, let's try that.

So, n=2, R=8.314 J/(mol·K), T=273.15 K, P=1 atm.

Compute V1 using PV =nRT → V1= (nRT)/P.

n=2, R=8.314, T=273.15, P=1 atm.

So, V1 = (2 *8.314 *273.15)/1.

Compute 8.314 *273.15 = let's compute 8 *273=2184; 0.314*273≈85.822; 8*273=2184; 0.314*273≈85.822 → Total 2184 +85.822=2269.822.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 8.314 *273.15 = ?

Well, 8 *273=2184.

0.3 *273=81.9.

0.014*273=3.822.

Adding 2184 +81.9=2265.9 +3.822=2269.722.

So, 8.314 *273.15 ≈2269.722.

Multiply by 2: 4539.444.

So, V1=4539.444 J / (1 atm).

Wait, but 1 atm is 101,325 pascals, and 1 J =1 N·m =1 kg·m².

But perhaps I'm mixing the units here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation.

So, V1=4539.444 J /1 atm → but since 1 atm=101,325 Pa, and 1 J=1 N·m =1 kg·m², perhaps this approach isn't leading me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the pressure to Pascals.

Wait, 1 atm=101,325 Pa.

So, V1= (2 *8.314 *273.15) / 101325.

Compute numerator: 2 *8.314=16.628.

16.628 *273.15= let's compute 16 *273.15=4,370.4; 0.628 *273.15≈171.18.

So, 4,370.4 +171.18=4,541.58.

Denominator:101,325.

So, V1=4,541.58 /101,325 ≈0.0448 m³.

Wait, that's 0.0448 cubic meters, which is 44.8 liters.

Wait, so V1=44.8 liters.

Then, the work done is w =nRT ln(V2/V1).

So, n=2, R=8.314, T=273.15, V1=44.8 L.

Wait, but I'm using R in J/(mol·K), but let's calculate nRT.

n=2, R=8.314, T=273.15.

nRT =2 *8.314 *273.15 =2 *8.314=16.628; 16.628 *273.15≈4,541.58.

So, units are J.

So, w =4,541.58 J * ln(V2/V1).

But wait, in this approach, V2 is in liters, so let me convert to meters.

1 m³ =1000 liters, so 1 liter=0.001 m³.

So, V1=44.8 liters =0.0448 m³.

So, V2=V1 *1.0058=0.0448 *1.0058≈0.0451 m³.

So, ln(V2/V1)=ln(0.0451/0.0448)=ln(1.00136)=approx 0.00136.

So, w=4,541.58 J * 0.00136 ≈6.18 J.

Wait, but the heat absorbed is 750 cal, which is much larger than 6 J. So, this can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the formula for the work done in an isothermal process without converting units, but using R in cal.

Wait, in that case, let's proceed.

So, n=2, R=237.14 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15 K, V1=?

Using PV =nRT → V1= (nRT)/P.

n=2, R=237.14, T=273.15, P=1 atm.

So, V1= (2 *237.14 *273.15) /1.

Compute numerator: 2 *237.14=474.28; 474.28*273.15=?

Well, 474.28 *200=94,856.

474.28 *70=33,200 (approx).

474.28 *3=1,422.84.

So, 94,856 +33,200=128,056 +1,422.84=129,478.84.

So, V1=129,478.84 cal/(1 atm).

Wait, but 1 atm is a pressure, so perhaps the units are not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without converting units.

Wait, but perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the work done in an isothermal process in terms of the initial and final volumes and find the initial volume.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to find the initial volume correctly.

So, initial volume V1= (nRT)/P.

n=2, R=237.14, T=273.15, P=1 atm.

So, V1= (2 *237.14 *273.15) /1 atm.

So, 2 *237.14=474.28.

474.28 *273.15=?

I'll compute 474.28 *273.15.

Well, 474 *273= let's compute 400*273=109,200; 70*273=19, 110 → 109,200 +19,110=128,310.

Wait, but 474.28 is 474 +0.28, and 273.15 is 273 +0.15.

So, using the distributive property:

(474 +0.28) * (273 +0.15) = 474*273 +474*0.15 +0.28*273 +0.28*0.15.

Compute each term:

474 *273 = 474 * (200 +70 +3) =474*200=94,800; 474*70=33,180; 474*3=1,422. Total =94,800 +33,180=127,980 +1,422=129,402.

474 *0.15=70.5.

0.28 *273=76.44.

0.28 *0.15=0.042.

So, adding all together:

129,402 +70.5 =129,472.5; +76.44=129,548.94; +0.042=129,549. So, approximately 129,549.

So, V1=129,549 /1 atm. Now, I need to find what units this corresponds to.

In the ideal gas law, PV =nRT, so the units of PV are in joules (if R is in J/(mol·K)), or in ergs (if R is in erg/(mol·K)).

But since the pressure is in atmospheres and volume in liters, perhaps the units are compatible.

Wait, 1 atm * 1 L = 101,325 J (since 1 L =0.001 m³; 1 atm =101,325 Pa; so 1 atm *1 L = 101,325 Pa * 0.001 m³ = 101.325 J).

So, 1 atm *1 L = 101.325 J.

So, V1 =129,549 L atm.

But since 1 L atm =101.325 J, then V1 =129,549 *101.325 J.

But wait, that would be a huge number, but we need to find V1 in liters, which would be 129,549 L.

Wait, but that can't be right, since R is in cal/(mol·K), not in J/(mol·K).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without converting units and just compute V1.

So, V1= (nRT)/P.

n=2, R=237.14, T=273.15, P=1 atm.

So, V1= (2 *237.14 *273.15) /1.

So, 2 *237.14=474.28.

474.28 *273.15=129,549. So, V1=129,549 liters.

Wait, but that's a huge volume, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use R=8.314 J/(mol·K), but then the units don't match.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with R=8.314 and see what happens.

So, n=2, R=8.314, T=273.15, P=1 atm.

Compute V1= (2 *8.314 *273.15) /1.

So, 2 *8.314=16.628.

16.628 *273.15=4,541.58.

So, V1=4,541.58 liters.

Which is 4,541.58 L.

But then, in this approach, we would need to calculate the work done.

So, work done is w =nRT ln(V2/V1).

n=2, R=8.314, T=273.15, V1=4,541.58 L.

So, w=2 *8.314 *273.15 *ln(V2/4541.58).

Compute 2 *8.314 *273.15=4,541.58.

So, w=4,541.58 * ln(V2/4541.58).

But we know that w=750 cal.

So, 750 =4,541.58 * ln(V2/4541.58).

So, ln(V2/4541.58)=750 /4541.58≈0.1653.

So, V2/4541.58= e^0.1653≈1.178.

So, V2≈4541.58 *1.178≈5,362 liters.

So, V2=5,362 liters.

But this seems possible, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, but this approach assumes that R is in J/(mol·K), which is 8.314, not in cal.

So, perhaps I should use R=237.14 for cal.

Wait, let's proceed.

So, with R=237.14, V1=4,541.58 liters.

Then, w=4,541.58 * ln(V2/4541.58).

Set w=750, so ln(V2/4541.58)=750/4541.58≈0.1653.

So, V2=4541.58 * e^0.1653≈4541.58 *1.178≈5,362 L.

So, V2=5,362 L.

So, the initial volume was 4541.58 L, and the final was 5,362 L.

So, the process would involve a certain amount of work.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use V1= (nRT)/P, where R is in cal/(mol·K), and P is in atm.

So, n=2, R=237.14, T=273.15, P=1 atm.

So, V1= (2 *237.14 *273.15)/1=129,549 liters.

Wait, that seems correct.

So, initial volume is 129,549 L.

Then, the final volume is 5,362 L.

So, the work done is 750 cal.

So, perhaps this approach is correct.

But I'm not sure because I've made some mistakes along the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to be solved using the formula for the work done in an isothermal process, without converting units.

Wait, but then the units don't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the answer should be approximately 6 J, which is 0.000168 cal, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to have the answer in cal, but perhaps that's impossible because the work done is 750 cal, which is a lot.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the work done in an isothermal process using the formula:

w = nRT ln(V2/V1).

But perhaps I can compute the work done using the formula:

w = nRT ln(V2/V1).

But since V2 is greater than V1, the work done is positive.

But perhaps I can compute the work done in terms of the initial and final pressures.

Wait, but perhaps I can proceed without converting units.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed using R=8.314 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but then the units would be inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed using the ideal gas law in terms of pressure and volume.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the initial pressure and the final pressure.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the work done in an isothermal process, which is:

w = nRT ln(V2/V1).

But perhaps I can compute w in terms of the initial pressure and final pressure.

Wait, but that would require knowing the pressures.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the initial and final pressures using the ideal gas law.

Wait, but then I need to know the initial and final volumes, which is what I'm trying to find.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed with the initial approach, where V1=129,549 L.

Then, the work done in converting this to 5,362 L is 750 cal.

But that seems very large.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the work done in converting a volume change.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the work done as the integral of pressure over the change in volume.

But perhaps that's more complicated.

Well, perhaps I can proceed with the given data.

So, initial volume V1=129,549 L.

Final volume V2=5,362 L.

So, the change in volume ΔV=V2 -V1=5,362 -129,549= -124,187 L.

So, the change in volume is a decrease of 124,187 liters.

So, the work done is w =PΔV.

But in this case, P is the initial pressure, and ΔV is the change in volume.

So, P =1 atm, ΔV= -124,187 L.

So, w=1 atm * (-124,187 L)= -124,187 L atm.

But we need to convert this to calories.

So, 1 L atm =101.325 J, and 1 J=1 cal.

So, 1 L atm =101.325 cal.

So, 124,187 L atm =124,187 *101.325 cal.

So, 124,187 *101.325.

Compute that.

First, 100,000 *101.325=10,132,500.

Then, 24,187 *101.325.

Compute 24,000 *101.325=2,457,120.

Then, 187 *101.325≈187*100=18,700 +187*1.325≈226.05.

So, 18,700 +226.05≈18,930. So, total for 24,187=2,457,120 +18,930≈2,441,550.

So, total w=10,132,500 +2,441,550≈12,773,500 cal.

But wait, earlier I calculated using the formula that w=750 cal, which is way less.

Hmm, so this suggests that either this approach is incorrect or there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the work done in converting the volume is negative, but that's possible.

Wait, but in our case, the work done is 750 cal, which suggests a positive value.

But according to this calculation, it's 12,773,500 cal, which is way too high.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the correct approach using the formula for the work done:

w = nRT ln(V2/V1).

Now, using n=2, R=237.14 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15 K, V1=129,549 L.

Wait, but V1 is in liters, which is inconsistent with R, which is in cal/(mol·K).

Wait, perhaps I should convert V1 to m³.

1 L =0.001 m³.

So, V1=129,549 L =0.129549 m³.

So, V1=0.129549 m³.

So, now, the formula becomes:

w =nRT ln(V2/V1).

n=2, R=237.14 cal/(mol·K), T=273.15 K.

So, w=2 *237.14 *273.15 * ln(V2/0.129549).

We need to find V2.

Wait, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing V2.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the work done is 750 cal.

So, 750 cal =2 *237.14 *273.15 * ln(V2/0.129549).

So, solving for V2.

So, 750=2*237.14*273.15*ln(V2/0.129549).

Compute 2*237.14=474.28.

474.28 *273.15=474.28 *200=94,856 +474.28*70=33,200 +474.28*3=1,522. So, total=94,856 +33,200=127,715 +1,522=129,215? Hmm, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 474.28 *273.15.

Let me compute 474.28 *200=94,856.

474.28 *70=32, 726. So, 474.28 *70=32,400. Wait, no, 474.28 *70=474.28*7*10=5,400.38*10=54,003.8.

Wait, 474.28 *273.15=?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator.

But since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed without computing the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as:

ln(V2/0.129549)=750/(2*237.14*273.15).

So, compute denominator: 2*237.14=474.28; 474.28*273.15=?

Wait, perhaps we can compute it as 474.28 *273.15.

Well, 474 *273=474 *200=95,400; 474 *70=33,180; 474 *3=1,422. So, 95,400 +33,180=127,400 +1,422=128,515.

But our actual value is 474.28 *273.15.

So, 474.28 *273.15= approximately 474 *273.15 +0.28 *273.15.

So, 474 *273.15= approx 128,515.

0.28 *273.15≈0.28*200=84 +0.28*70=10.2 → 84+10.2=93.2.

So, total is 128,515 +93.2≈128,600.

So, 474.28 *273.15≈128,600.

So, ln(V2/0.129549)=750 /128,600≈0.00729.

So, ln(V2/129.549)=0.00729.

So, V2/129.549= e^0.00729≈1.00729.

So, V2=129.549 *1.00729≈129.549 + (129.549 *0.00729).

Compute 129.549 *0.00729≈0.359.

So, V2≈129.549 +0.359≈129.97 L.

So, V2≈129.97 L.

So, the volume increases by about 0.43 L.

Hmm, so then, the work done is 750 cal.

So, this seems correct.

So, the initial volume is 129,549 L, and the final volume is approximately 129.97 L.

So, the amount of work done is 750 cal.

So, this seems correct.

So, the answer is 750 cal.

So, the option would be option C, which is 750 cal.

So, the answer is C.

So, the final answer is option C.
</think>

To determine the work done during the process, we use the formula for the work done in an isothermal process:

\[ w = nRT \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right) \]

Given:
- \( n = 2 \) (moles)
- \( R = 237.14 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} \) (constant)
- \( T = 273.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( V_1 = 129,549 \, \text{L} \) (initial volume)
- \( V_2 \) is the final volume to be determined
- \( w = 750 \, \text{cal} \) (work done)

First, calculate the ratio \( \frac{V_2}{V_1} \):

\[ 1 \, \text{atm} \times \Delta V = 750 \, \text{cal} \]
\[ 1 \, \text{atm} = 101.325 \, \text{J} \]
\[ 1 \, \text{L·atm} = 101.325 \, \text{J} \]
\[ 1 \, \text{L·atm} = 101.325 \, \text{J} = 101.325 \, \text{cal} \]

Convert \( V_1 \) to \( \text{m}^3 \):
\[ V_1 = 129,549 \, \text{L} = 0.129549 \, \text{m}^3 \]

Now, plug the known values into the work formula and solve for \( V_2 \):

\[ 750 = 2 \times 237.14 \times 273.15 \times \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{0.129549}\right) \]
\[ 750 = 2 \times 237.14 \times 273.15 \times \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{0.129549}\right) \]
\[ 750 = 237.14 \times 273.15 \times 2 \times \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{0.129549}\right) \]
\[ 750 = 2 \times 237.14 \times 273.15 \times \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{0.129549}\right) \]

Calculate \( 2 \times 237.14 \times 273.15 \):

\[ 2 \times 237.14 = 474.28 \]
\[ 474.28 \times 273.15 = 128,600 \]

Now, solve for the natural logarithm:

\[ 750 = 128,600 \times \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{0.129549}\right) \]
\[ \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{0.129549}\right) = \frac{750}{128,600} \]
\[ \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{0.129549}\right) = 0.00729 \]

Exponentiate both sides:

\[ \frac{V_2}{0.129549} = e^{0.00729} \]
\[ \frac{V_2}{0.129549} \approx 1.00729 \]

Solve for \( V_2 \):

\[ V_2 = 0.129549 \times 1.00729 \]
\[ V_2 \approx 0.13005 \, \text{m}^3 \]
\[ V_2 \approx 129.7 \, \text{L} \]

Finally, calculate the work done:

\[ w = 750 \, \text{cal} \]

Thus, the answer is:

**ANSWER: C**
