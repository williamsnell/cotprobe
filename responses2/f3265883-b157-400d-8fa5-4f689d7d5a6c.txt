Okay, so I have this question about neuronal membrane potential changes. Hmm, let me think. The question says the membrane potential changes from +50mV to -70mV. I remember that membrane potential refers to the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane. 

Let me break down the options. First, the change from a positive to a negative is a significant decrease. So, the starting point is positive, and the ending is negative. So what's the term for this?

Option A is threshold potential. Wait, I think threshold potential is the minimum ion concentration needed to depolarize a neuron. So that's the point when the membrane potential reaches a certain level, and once it's below that, the neuron starts firing. That doesn't sound like an increase.

Option B is hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more negative, which is depolarization, right? Or wait, no—wait, if the membrane potential goes from positive to more negative, that's depolarization. Wait, no: wait, positive is more positive than negative. So, for example, if you have a resting membrane at say, -70mV, and then it goes to -50mV, that's depolarization. So if the membrane goes from +50 to -70, that's a big jump—so that's a depolarization, but that's a decrease. So B is hyperpolarization, maybe that's not right.

Option C is action potential. An action potential is a wave of depolarization followed by a repolarization. Like a wave of activation followed by a reset. So that's when the membrane becomes depolarized again. But the question is just about the change from one point to another, not a wave. So I don't think this is about an action potential.

Option D is equilibrium potential. That's when the membrane potential is at a steady state, not changing. So that's more about the resting potential, like when the cell is at rest. So the question isn't about rest, so probably not D.

Option E is resting potential. That's the resting membrane potential, which is usually around -70mV, right? So if the membrane was at +50mV and then goes to -70mV, that's a depolarization, but it's not the resting potential. So E is not the case here.

Option F is a graded potential. Wait, I'm not sure if that's a correct term. Graded potentials are more about the different types of potentials. I think graded potentials are when the membrane potential is between resting and depolarized or hyperpolarized. But I'm not certain. Could be a term I don't remember. Maybe not the right answer.

Option G is depolarization. Oh, that's what I was thinking earlier. The change from +50 to -70 is a decrease in potential, so it's a depolarization. So that's a decrease, which fits the description.

Option H is synapse potential. Synaptic potentials are changes that occur during transmission across a synapse, but the term itself refers to the change in potential. But the question is about the change in membrane potential, not the synapse's role. So H is probably not the right term.

Option I is refractory period. That's the time after a neuron's action potential that it cannot fire again. It's a period where the neuron is inactive. So that's unrelated to the membrane potential change.

Option J is repolarization. Repolarization is when the membrane potential increases, moving back towards resting. So if it's from +50 to -70, that's a big drop. Repolarization is the opposite of depolarization. So no.

So the options are A, B, G, F, J. Let's re-examine. The question is about a change from +50 to -70, which is a significant decrease. So it's a depolarization. So the answer should be G. 

Wait, let me think again. Option G is depolarization. So yes, the change is a depolarization. So the correct answer is G.

The question involves a change in a neuron's membrane potential from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **Option A (Threshold potential):** This refers to the minimum ion concentration needed to depolarize a neuron, not a change in membrane potential.
- **Option B (Hyperpolarization):** This describes a more negative membrane potential, but the question involves an increase in negativity, not a decrease.
- **Option C (Action potential):** This is a wave of depolarization followed by repolarization, not a single change in membrane potential.
- **Option D (Equilibrium potential):** This is a steady state, not a single change.
- **Option E (Resting potential):** This is the resting state at -70mV, unrelated to the question.
- **Option F (Graded potential):** While relevant, it is not a standard term for describing the change.
- **Option G (Depolarization):** The change from +50mV to -70mV represents a significant decrease, which is a depolarization.
- **Option H (Synapse potential):** Refers to changes during transmission, not membrane potential.
- **Option I (Refractory period):** Inactive period, unrelated to membrane potential.
- **Option J (Repolarization):** Represents an increase in potential, opposite of the question.

The correct answer is **Option G (Depolarization)**, as the membrane potential decreases significantly.

**Answer: G**
