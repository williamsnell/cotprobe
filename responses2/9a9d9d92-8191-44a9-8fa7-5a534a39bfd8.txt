Okay, so I have this question about financial statements, and I need to figure out which one the government entity must include a statement of cash flows in. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that different types of financial statements are used by different entities. The standard financial statements include things like the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics for government entities.

I know that the U.S. GAAP has some specific requirements for the government sector. Government entities, like the government itself, are usually required to follow U.S. GAAP. So, their financial statements must comply with that.

Looking at the options, I see that option H is "Government-wide financial statements." I think that's a term used for the government's financial reporting. There's also mention of other financial statements like the statement of revenues, expenses, and profits (which is the income statement), and the statement of cash flows.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the statement of cash flows. I recall that the government-wide financial statements typically include the statement of cash flows as well. Because the government handles its finances on a large scale, it's compiled into these statements, which summarize cash inflows and outflows.

So, the options are A to J. The government entity needs to include the statement of cash flows in its financial statements. Looking at the options, option H is "Government-wide financial statements." That makes sense because these include the necessary financial details, including the cash flow statement.

I think I'm confident now that the correct answer is H.

The government entity must include a statement of cash flows in its **Government-wide financial statements**. These financial statements are compiled by the government to provide a comprehensive overview of its financial performance, including cash flows. 

Answer: H
