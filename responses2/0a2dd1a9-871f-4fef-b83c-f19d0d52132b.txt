Question:

If $f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5$, find the value of $f( -2)$.

Options:

B: 5

D: 24
E: -64
F: 75
G: -24
H: 85
I: -75
J: -65

Okay, so I have this function f(x) = 8x³ -6x² -4x +5, and I need to find f(-2). Hmm, I remember that to find the value of a function at a certain point, you just substitute that point into the function. So, I'll replace every x in the equation with -2.

Let me write it out step by step. f(-2) would be 8*(-2)³ minus 6*(-2)² minus 4*(-2) plus 5. Wait, let me calculate each term one by one.

First term: 8 multiplied by (-2) cubed. Let's see, (-2) cubed is (-2)*(-2)*(-2). That's (-2)*4 which is -8. Then 8 times -8 is -64. Okay, first term is -64.

Second term: -6 multiplied by (-2) squared. (-2) squared is 4, right? So -6 *4 is -24. Wait, no, wait. Because the term is -6x², so x² is 4, so that's -6 *4 = -24. But wait, the original function is -6x², so that's negative 6 times x squared, which is 4, so yes, -24.

Third term: -4 multiplied by (-2). That's -4 * (-2) = +8. So the third term is +8.

The last term is just +5.

Now, adding all these together: -64 -24 +8 +5.

Let me compute that step by step. First, -64 minus 24 is -88. Then, adding 8 gives me -80. Then adding 5, that's -75.

Wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes signs can be tricky. So, breaking it down:

8*(-2)^3 = 8*(-8) = -64.

-6*(-2)^2 = -6*(4) = -24.

-4*(-2) = +8.

Plus 5.

Now adding: -64 -24 is -88, plus 8 is -80, plus 5 is -75.

Looking at the options, option E is -75. So the answer should be E.

The function is evaluated at \( x = -2 \):
\[
f(-2) = 8(-2)^3 -6(-2)^2 -4(-2) +5
\]
Calculating each term:
- \( (-2)^3 = -8 \), so \( 8(-8) = -64 \)
- \( (-2)^2 = 4 \), so \( -6(4) = -24 \)
- \( -4(-2) = 8 \)
Adding all terms: \( -64 -24 +8 +5 = -75 \). 

Answer: E: -75
