Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I remember that calculus can get tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The function given is f(x) = x³ + 2x² – 9x – 18. The question is asking which of the statements A to J is true. Hmm, I need to figure out each statement one by one.

First, I think I should find the derivative of the function because that will tell me about the increasing and decreasing intervals. The derivative f'(x) should tell me where the function is increasing or decreasing.

Calculating the derivative: f'(x) = 3x² + 4x – 9. Right, because the derivative of x³ is 3x², 2x² becomes 4x, –9x becomes –9, and the derivative of –18 is 0.

Now, I need to find where the derivative is positive (increasing) and where it's negative (decreasing). To do that, I'll find the critical points by setting f'(x) to zero and solving for x.

So, 3x² + 4x – 9 = 0. Let me try to factor this or use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is 3x² +4x -9=0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)
Here, a=3, b=4, c=-9.

Discriminant D = 16 + 108 = 124. So sqrt(124) is about 11.1355.

So x = [ -4 ± 11.1355 ] / (6 )

Calculating both roots:
First root: (-4 + 11.1355)/6 = (7.1355)/6 ≈ 1.189.
Second root: (-4 -11.1355)/6 = (-15.1355)/6 ≈ -2.5226.

So critical points at approximately x ≈ 1.189 and x ≈ -2.5226.

Now, to determine the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing, I can test the intervals around these critical points and also consider the behavior as x approaches positive and negative infinity.

But wait, the function is a cubic, so as x approaches positive infinity, f(x) tends to infinity (since the leading term is x³), and as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) tends to negative infinity. That's a general behavior.

Also, the leading coefficient is positive, so the cubic will go from negative infinity to positive infinity. So the function will have a local maximum and minimum at these critical points.

So let's think about the intervals:

1. x < -2.5226: Let's pick x = -3. Evaluate f'(x): 3*(-3)^2 +4*(-3) -9 = 27 -12 -9 = 6. Positive. So function is increasing here.

2. Between x ≈ -2.5226 and x ≈ 1.189: Let's pick x=0. f'(0)=0+0-9= -9. Negative. So function is decreasing here.

3. x > 1.189: Let's pick x=2. f'(2)=3*(4)+8-9=12+8-9=11. Positive. So function is increasing.

So the function is increasing on (-infty, -2.5226), decreasing on (-2.5226, 1.189), and increasing again on (1.189, +infty).

Now, let's look at the statements.

Option A: The function is decreasing for x ≥3. But from our earlier analysis, the function is increasing for x>1.189. So for all x≥3, it's increasing. So A is false.

Option B: f(x)=0 has two real solutions. A cubic must have at least one real solution, but can have up to three. Let me check the function.

Let me compute f(3): 27 + 18 -27 -18 = 0. Oh, so x=3 is a root. Let me try f(-3): (-27) + 18 +27 -18 = 0. So x=-3 is another root. So f(x) can be factored as (x+3)(x-3)(x+2). Wait, let me check:

Wait, f(x) = (x - 3)(x + 3)(x + 2). Let me expand that:

(x -3)(x +3) is x² –9. Multiply by (x+2): (x² -9)(x+2) = x³ +2x² -9x -18. Which matches. So yes, roots at x=3, x=-3, and x=-2. So that's three real solutions. So B says two, which is false.

Option C: f(x) ≥ –18 for all x≥0. Let me see. Let's compute f(0): 0 +0 –0 –18 = -18. So f(0) is -18. What about for x>0?

The function f(x) is increasing after x ≈1.189. So for x>1.189, the function is increasing. Let me check x=2: f(2)=8 +8 –18 –18= 16 –36= -20. That's less than -18. So at x=2, f(x) is -20, which is less than -18. So f(x) goes below -18. Therefore, statement C is false because not all x≥0 have f(x) ≥-18. For example, at x=2, it's -20 < -18.

Option D: The function is increasing for x ≥-3. So from x=-3 onwards. Let's see: from x=-3 to x=1.189, the function is decreasing. So for x ≥-3, the function is increasing only up to x=1.189. So for x >1.189, it's increasing again. So the function isn't always increasing for x ≥-3. For example, at x=2, it's increasing, but at x= -2.5, it's decreasing. So statement D is false.

Option E: The function is decreasing for x ≤-3. Let's see. From our earlier analysis, the derivative is negative between x≈-2.5226 and x≈1.189. So for x ≤-3, which is definitely in that interval, the function is decreasing. So E is true. Because for x ≤-3, the function is decreasing.

Option F: f(x)=0 has three real solutions. We found that f(x) has roots at x=3, x=-3, x=-2. So three real solutions. So statement F is false.

Option G: f(x) ≤ –18 for all x ≤0. Hmm. Let's check some points. x=0, f(x)= -18. x=-1: f(-1)= (-1)^3 +2*(-1)^2 -9*(-1) –18= -1 +2 +9 –18= ( -1 +2=1; +9=10; -18= -8). So f(-1) = -8. That's greater than -18. So saying that f(x) ≤-18 for all x ≤0 is false because at x=-1, it's -8 which is higher than -18. So G is false.

Option H: f(x) > –18 for all x <0. Let's check x approaching 0 from the left. For x approaching 0, f(x) approaches -18. For x=-1: f(-1)=-8 > -18. So for all x<0, is f(x) greater than -18? Well, at x approaching 0, say x= -0.1: f(-0.1)= (-0.1)^3 + 2*(0.01) –9*(-0.1) –18= -0.001 +0.02 +0.9 –18= (0.019) +0.9= 0.919 –18= -17.081, which is greater than -18. So maybe H is true. But wait, is f(x) always above -18 for x<0?

Wait, let's think about f(x) for x<0. The function is f(x) = x³ + 2x² -9x -18. Let's see for x negative, x³ is negative, 2x² is positive, -9x is positive (since x is negative, -9x is positive), and -18 is negative.

So what's the minimum value of f(x) for x<0? Let's evaluate at x=0: f(0) = -18. What about x approaching negative infinity? As x→-infty, x³ dominates, so f(x) approaches -infty. So f(x) must cross below -18 somewhere for x<0.

Wait, but the statement is "f(x) > –18 for all x <0". If x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, which is less than -18. So there are points where f(x) < -18 for x <0. Therefore, statement H is false.

Option I: f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤–3. Let's check x=-3: f(-3)= (-27) + 18 +27 -18= 0. At x=-2: f(-2)= (-8) + 8 +18 -18= (0) + (0)=0. Wait, but what about x < -3, like x=-4.

Compute f(-4)= (-64) + 2*(16) –9*(-4) –18 = -64 +32 +36 –18. Let's calculate: -64 +32= -32; -32 +36=4; 4-18=-14. So f(-4)= -14, which is less than 0. So for x=-4, which is ≤-3, f(x)=-14 ≤0. But wait, what about x=-5: f(-5)= (-125) + 2*(25) –9*(-5) –18= -125 +50 +45 –18. Compute: -125 +50= -75; -75+45= -30; -30-18= -48. So f(-5)= -48, which is less than zero. Wait, but what about x=-3: f(x)=0. So statement I says that f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤-3. But at x=-3, it's zero. At x < -3, it's negative. So for x ≤-3, the function is ≤0. Because at x=-3, it's 0, and for x < -3, it's less than zero. So statement I is true.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. For x=-3, it's 0. For x less than -3, is f(x) always ≤0?

Wait, let's pick x=-4. f(-4)=-14 <0. x=-5, f(x)=-48 <0. So for all x ≤-3, f(x) ≤0. So statement I is true.

Option J: f(x)=0 has no real solutions. But earlier, we found that x=3, x=-3, x=-2 are real solutions. So statement J is false.

So now, going back to the options.

Which statements are true?

Option E: f(x) is decreasing for x ≥-3. Yes, because between x=-3 and x≈1.189, the function is decreasing. So E is true.

Option I: f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤-3. Also true, as discussed.

Wait, but the options are individual statements, so the correct answers are E and I.

Wait, looking back, the question says 'which of the following statements is true' and the options are A to J. So only one option can be correct? Or multiple can be correct? Wait, the question doesn't say, but I think in multiple choice questions like this, each option is a separate statement, and the correct ones would be all that are true.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says "which of the following statements is true", so perhaps more than one may be correct. But I'll have to check again.

Wait, I thought E and I are both true. Let me recheck.

E: The function is decreasing for x ≥-3. Yes, because in that interval, the function is decreasing. So E is true.

I: f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤-3. Yes, because at x=-3, it's 0, and for x < -3, it's negative. So I is true.

So the correct statements are E and I.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each is a separate statement. So the correct choices would be those that are true. So in the multiple-choice scenario, E and I would be the correct answers.

Wait, but the options are not multiple choice but all options A-F. So perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, but no, looking back, the question is a multiple-choice question where the options are A to J, each being a statement, and the correct answer is one of them. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing the options.

Wait, perhaps only I is correct. Because in my earlier analysis, E is also correct because the function is decreasing for x≥-3. But E is a separate option. So the possible correct options would be E and I.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. Are there any other correct options?

Wait, looking back at the options:

E says the function is decreasing for x≥3. Earlier analysis shows that for x≥3, the function is increasing because the derivative is positive. So E claims it's decreasing for x≥3, which is false.

I says it's ≤0 for all x≤-3. Which is true.

Option E is false.

So among the options, E is false.

Wait, let me recheck:

E: The function is decreasing for x ≥3. As per the analysis, the function is increasing for x≥1.189, so E is false.

Option I: f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤–3. Which is true.

So in the options, only I is correct. But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back at the question, the options are:

E: The function f(x) is decreasing for x ≥3.

I: f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤–3.

Yes, I think only I is correct.

Wait, but I think I may have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the function.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me double-check that.

f(x) =x³ + 2x² –9x –18

f'(x) = 3x² +4x –9. Correct.

Critical points at x=(-4 ± sqrt(16 + 108))/6 → (-4 ±11.1355)/6.

So x≈1.189 and x≈-2.5226. Correct.

So the function is increasing on (-infty, -2.5226), decreasing on (-2.5226, 1.189), and increasing again on (1.189, infty).

Now, looking at statement E: x≥3, which is beyond x≈1.189. So for x≥3, the function is increasing. Therefore, E is false.

Statement I: all x≤-3, f(x)≤0. As I saw, for x=-3, f(x)=0, and for x< -3, f(x) is negative. So yes, I is true.

So only option I is correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that E is correct. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, E is incorrect. Because E claims the function is decreasing for x≥3, but from x=3 onwards, the function is increasing, so E is false.

So only option I is correct.
