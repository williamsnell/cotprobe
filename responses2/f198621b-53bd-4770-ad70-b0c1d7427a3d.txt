Question:

Options:

A: can be proven false with logical reasoning.
B: are independent: You can accept either part without accepting the other.
C: are based purely on empirical evidence.
D: are not open to debate or disagreement.
E: cannot be justified via rational means.
F: can only be justified through emotional appeal.
G: are based on personal preferences and biases.
H: are dependent on each other, but can be accepted separately.
I: are interdependent: You cannot accept one part without accepting the other.
J: are provable from self-evident premises.

Okay, so I've got this question about Rawls' theory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the two parts of his theory, and the options given are A through J. I remember that Rawls had two main points in his ethics, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll try to recall.

First, I think he had two main components of his theory. Let me think about what they might be. Oh, right, the two parts are about justice and the constitution. One part is about the state of the world, and the other is about the rights of society. Wait, no, maybe it's different. I think one part was about the rule of law and the other about the rights. Alternatively, I'm trying to remember if he had two distinct concepts.

Wait, another approach: I remember that Rawls divided his theory into two parts, each related but distinct. The first part is about the state of the world, which is about the constitution, making sure that society is in a certain state. The second part is about the rights, which is about the constitution ensuring the rights of each person in society.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is probably about how he viewed these two parts. Let me go through the options again.

Option A: can be proven false with logical reasoning. I don't think that's the case. I think Rawls didn't think either part could be proven; they were foundational principles.

Option B: are independent: You can accept either part without accepting the other. Hmm, I'm not sure. I thought that he required both parts to be accepted as part of his theory. Maybe that's not right.

Option C: based purely on empirical evidence. No, I don't think so. He was a philosopher, not an empiricist, so he probably didn't rely on evidence.

Option D: are not open to debate or disagreement. That doesn't sound right either. I remember he thought they should be widely accepted.

Option E: cannot be justified via rational means. I think he argued against that, saying both parts are justifiable.

Option F: can only be justified through emotional appeal. I don't think he did that. He was more critical of emotional reasoning.

Option G: based on personal preferences and biases. No, I don't think that's accurate. His approach was more about systematic and rational principles.

Option H: are dependent on each other, but can be accepted separately. Wait, maybe this is the correct answer. I think he thought both parts should hold together but can be accepted independently. So, maybe he didn't require both to be proven together, but each can be accepted separately. Like, each part is a valid principle, but they work together in a system.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the theory parts. Let me think again. The theory of justice and the constitution. The two parts are about the state of the world and the rights. So, he might have thought that each part is a necessary component, but they can stand on their own. So, perhaps the answer is H, which says they are dependent but can be accepted separately.

Alternatively, option J says they are provable from self-evident premises. I don't think that's the case because he's more critical of rational justification.

Wait, another angle: the two parts of Rawls' theory. I think he had two main components. One was about the state of the world (the constitution) and the other about the rights. He thought that each part is a good principle but that they need to be together in a system. So, each is a necessary part, but they can be accepted separately.

So, looking back at the options, option H: are dependent on each other but can be accepted separately. That fits. Because he thought they work together but can stand on their own. So, if both must hold together, but each can be accepted, then H is correct.

Wait, but I also remember that he said both parts are needed, not just one. So, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because he thought they are not open to debate.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option D says "are not open to debate or disagreement." I don't think that's correct because Rawls thought his theory was meant to be a framework, not just a set of principles that could be debated.

Option H: "are dependent on each other, but can be accepted separately." Since he didn't think they were separate but dependent, but each can be accepted on its own. So, that would mean the two parts work together, but each can be taken as a separate principle.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Another thought: I recall reading that Rawls had two fundamental principles, each being a component of his ethical framework. He believed that both parts were necessary, but he didn't think they could be independent. So, maybe the correct answer is that they are dependent but can be accepted separately. So, option H.

Wait, but another angle: I remember that he presented two parts of his theory, each requiring rational analysis. So, perhaps he thought both are justified, but they must be accepted together. So, H might not be correct. Alternatively, the fact that they are not open to agreement (option D) doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, which is about being provable from self-evident premises. But I don't think that's accurate because he's more critical of that approach.

Wait, let me try to think of what the two parts are. He had two main theses: The first was about the state of the world (the constitution of the state) and the second about the rights (the constitution of the rights). He thought that each can be justified independently, but together they form a coherent system.

So, if that's the case, then the correct statement would be that they are dependent but can be accepted separately. So, option H.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the correct answer is D. Because he thought they are not open to debate, but I'm not sure. I thought he believed both parts are necessary and must be accepted.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the two parts. Maybe the two parts are that they can't be proven separately, but together they are. Hmm.

Another thought: I think in his theory, the two parts are not independent, but together they form a necessary system. So, perhaps the correct answer is H: dependent on each other but can be accepted separately.

So, I'm leaning towards option H being correct.
</think>

The correct answer is **H: are dependent on each other, but can be accepted separately.**

**Explanation:** Rawls' theory is divided into two parts, each representing a foundational principle. While both parts are necessary and cannot be independently proven, they are interconnected. This dependency allows for their acceptance on their own terms within the broader ethical framework. Therefore, the correct statement is that the two parts are dependent but can be accepted separately. 

ANSWER: H
