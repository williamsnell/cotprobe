A: 303 l
B: 499.5 l
C: 546 l
D: 273 l
E: 30 l
F: 600 l
G: 90 l
H: 60 l
I: 333 l
J: 450 l

Okay, let's try to solve this gas problem. So, the question is about changing the pressure and temperature of a gas to reach standard conditions and finding the new volume. Hmm, I think I remember something about the combined gas law.

The gas law formula is PV = nRT. Right, and when temperature and pressure change, the volume will change proportionally. Oh wait, standard conditions are when the pressure is 1 atm and the temperature is 0°C, which is 273 K. So the initial conditions are P1=33.3 atm, V1=30 L, T1=273°C, which is 546 K (since 273 + 273 = 546). We need to find V2 at standard conditions, so P2=1 atm, T2=273 K.

So using the combined gas law: (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. But wait, I think it's better to use the formula (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. Because when you rearrange, it becomes V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1). Or is it another way around? Let me think: the formula is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. So solving for V2: V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. When you have P1, V1, T1 and you want to find V2, P2, T2. So rearranging the equation: V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1). Wait, is that correct? Because the initial equation is (P1 V1)/(T1) = (P2 V2)/(T2), so cross-multiplying gives P1 V1 T2 = P2 V2 T1. So V2 = (P1 V1 T2) / (P2 T1). Yep, that's right.

So plugging in the numbers: P1 is 33.3 atm, V1 is 30 L, T1 is 546 K. P2 is 1 atm, T2 is 273 K.

So V2 = (33.3 atm * 30 L * 273 K) / (1 atm * 546 K). Let's compute that.

First, let's handle the numbers. 33.3 *30 is 999. Then 999 *273. Hmm, wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

So 33.3 *30 = 999. Then 999 *273. Let me compute that: 1000 *273 is 273000, minus 1 *273 is 273. So 273000 -273 = 272727. Then, divide by (1 *546), which is 546. So 272727 / 546 equals what?

Hmm, let's divide 272727 by 546. Let me see, 546 * 499.5 = ?

Wait, 546 * 500 = 273000. So 546 *499.5 = 273000 - 546*0.5 = 273000 -273 = 272727. Oh, so 546 *499.5 = 272727. So V2 is 499.5 L.

Wait, but let me double-check. So 546 * 499.5 = 546*(500 -0.5) = 546*500 =273000; 546 *0.5=273. So 273000 -273=272727. Which is exactly our numerator. So yes, V2 is 499.5 L.

Looking at the options, option B is 499.5 l. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

Rearranging for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}
\]

### Given values:
- \( P_1 = 33.3 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( V_1 = 30 \, \text{L} \)
- \( T_1 = 273^\circ \text{C} = 546 \, \text{K} \) (since \( T = 273 + 273 \))
- \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( T_2 = 273 \, \text{K} \) (standard temperature)

### Calculation:
\[
V_2 = \frac{33.3 \times 30 \times 273}{1 \times 546}
\]

First, compute the numerator:
\[
33.3 \times 30 = 999
\]
\[
999 \times 273 = 272,727
\]

Now, compute the denominator:
\[
1 \times 546 = 546
\]

Divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[
V_2 = \frac{272,727}{546} = 499.5 \, \text{L}
\]

### Conclusion:
The volume of the gas at standard conditions is \( 499.5 \, \text{L} \). Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:
