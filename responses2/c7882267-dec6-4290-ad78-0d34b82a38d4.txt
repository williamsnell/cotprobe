Question:

Alice owned Greyacre, a one-acre piece of property, in fee simple. Alice sold the property to Barbara who moved into the only residence on the land. Barbara neglected to record the deed, and three years later, Alice conveyed the same property to Charlene who immediately filed the deed she received from Alice. Greyacre's jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. If an action is filed for title to the property, the likely outcome would be for

Options:

A: Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.
B: Barbara, because she was the first to record her deed.
C: Alice, since she made two valid sales of the same property.
D: Charlene, because she was the first to record her deed.
E: Barbara, due to her physical possession of the property.
F: Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.
G: Charlene, because she relied on Alice's representation of ownership.
H: Alice, as she never actually transferred the property rights.
I: Charlene, as Barbara did not officially record her deed.
J: Charlene, because she was the last to receive the deed from Alice.

Okay, so I've got this real property question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through.

The scenario is about Alice selling property to Barbara and then to Charlene. The question is about the outcome if someone files for title, considering racenotice statute and a tract index system. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, let me understand the facts. Alice has a one-acre property, Greyacre. She sold it to Barbara who bought a residence. Then, three years later, she sold the same property to Charlene. The key here is that Barbara didn't record her deed, and Charlene immediately filed it. 

So, the important points are:

1. Barbara didn't record the deed she received from Alice. 
2. Charlene received the deed and filed it immediately. 

The jurisdiction has a racenotice statute and a tract index system. I remember that racenotice is a common law doctrine where if the first to record the deed is the person who conveyed the property, that person is deemed to have the title. But I'm not exactly sure how that applies here.

Wait, racenotice is when the first person to record the deed is deemed to have the property. But in this case, Barbara didn't record. So Barbara is between the first and third party, right? Because Alice sold to Barbara, who didn't record. Then the third party was Alice who then sold to Charlene. 

Wait, no, the third party is Charlene. So the sequence is Alice → Barbara (no record) → Charlene (record). So the first to record is Charlene. So according to racenotice, Charlene would be deemed to have the title. But wait, racenotice applies when the recording is done after the original owner has lived in. Like, if someone (A) sold to B, and B didn't record, then the next seller (C) takes over. So the racenotice would consider whether C's recording is after B's. But wait, in this case, B didn't record. So if the next person (C) records, is that sufficient?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think. The racenotice system says that the first person to record is deemed to have the title. So if the first to record is the third party, then that person is deemed to have the title. But in racenotice, the first to record is deemed to have title, regardless of when they recorded.

Wait, but that's only if the first person to record is the one who actually took over. So in this case, Barbara didn't record. So the next person, Alice, did. But Alice then sold it to Charlene. So the recording is from Alice to Charlene. So who is the first to record? It's Alice to Barbara, but Barbara didn't record, so the next one was Alice to Charlene. But wait, the actual transfer was from Alice to Barbara (no record), and then Alice to Charlene. So the first to record is Alice. 

Wait, no, no. Because Barbara didn't record, so the next person was Alice. So Alice made the first recording, and then Barbara didn't record. So the first to record is Alice. Then she sells to Barbara, who doesn't record. Then Alice (the third party) sells to Charlene, who records. So the first to record is Alice. 

But wait, in racenotice, the first to record is deemed to have the title. So Alice, being the first to record, would be deemed to have the title. So if someone is seeking title, and the first to record is the third party, then that person (Alice) is deemed to have the title. 

Alternatively, if the first to record is the one who actually sold to the next owner. So if Barbara didn't record, then the next person who recorded was Alice. So Alice is deemed to have the title because she's the first to record. 

Wait, but wait, another thought. In the racenotice statute, the first person to record is deemed to have title. But the statute could also require that the title is with the third party if the first to record is the same as the original owner. Or is that a different system?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up with the "first in time" system. The "first in time" system says that the person who first actually owned the property is deemed to have the title. That would apply here because the original owner is Alice, who sold to Barbara (first), then to Charlene (third). So in the first-in-time system, Alice would be deemed to have the title because she's the first to actually own the property. 

But racenotice is a common law doctrine, which says that the first to record is deemed to have the title. So, if the racenotice statute is in place, the first to record would be deemed to have the title. 

So in this case, the first to record is Alice, because she was the one who first recorded. So she would be deemed to have the title of the property. So if a title search is conducted, the first person to record (Alice) would be the one who would be found to have the title. 

But wait, looking at the options, option C says Alice, as she made two valid sales. That's a bit confusing. Wait, no, because the first to record is Alice, and the second sale is by Alice again, but that's irrelevant for the title. 

Another angle: in the racenotice system, the third party to sell the property (Charlene) would not be considered to have the title unless the first to record is the original owner. So if the first to record is Alice, then she's deemed to have the title. 

But then, what about the tract index system? I'm not too sure how that affects this. A tract index system would help determine the validity of the deed, ensuring that the property wasn't encumbered by prior encumbrances. But I'm not sure how it would affect the racenotice aspect. Maybe it would prevent the recording of invalid deeds, but the racenotice is more about the recording order. 

So the racenotice would determine that the first to record (Alice) is deemed to have the title, making option C correct. Alternatively, if it's the third party (Charlene) to record, but she's not the first to record. So let's think again.

Wait, the first to record is the one who first took the deed. Barbara didn't record, so she comes after Alice. So Alice is the first to record. Then Alice sells to Barbara, who doesn't record. So the next person, which is Charlene, records. 

So in racenotice, the first to record is deemed to have the title. So Alice, being the first to record, would be the one deemed to have the title. So the answer would be C: Alice, as she made two valid sales of the same property. Wait, but two valid sales might not matter. The key is the first to record. So, the answer is C.

Wait, but what about the fact that Barbara didn't record. So the first to record is Alice. So that's why she's deemed to have the title. So the correct answer would be C.
</think>

The correct answer is C: Alice, as she made two valid sales of the same property. Here's why:

1. **Racenotice System**: The first person to record a deed is deemed to have the title. Barbara did not record, so the first to record was Alice. Alice's recording of the deed would make her the one deemed to have the title.

2. **Tract Index System**: This system helps ensure the validity of the deed, but it doesn't affect the racenotice principle, which focuses on the order of recording.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J** are incorrect because they either misattribute the ownership or don't consider the racenotice system.
   - **C** is correct because the first to record (Alice) is deemed to have the title.
