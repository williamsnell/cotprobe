Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Co-60 source in a hospital. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that the source has a certain activity and we're supposed to find the rate of gamma rays incident on a patient.

Wait, the activity is given as 3.0 x 10^14 Bq. Right, because Bq is Becquerels, which is the same as decays per second. 

The patient is 0.30 m² in area, and the distance from the source is 4.0 meters. But wait, the question isn't directly about radiation or dose, so I think I don't need to worry about that here. The main thing is figuring out the number of gamma rays emitted per second.

Co-60 emits gamma rays at 1.1 MeV and 1.3 MeV. So, each decay releases two different gamma rays. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, each decay emits both 1.1 and 1.3 MeV, right? So each disintegration gives two gamma rays: one at lower energy (1.1) and one at higher (1.3) energy. So the total energy per decay is 1.1 + 1.3 = 2.4 MeV.

But wait, the question is about the rate of gamma rays, not the energy. So they're asking for the number of gamma rays per second, each at their respective energies. Or is it the number of each type? Wait, the question says, "the rate of gamma rays incident on a patient... is X * 10^11 Bq." Wait no, wait. No, Bq is the activity, which is decays per second. But the question is about the number of gamma rays per second, not the energy.

Wait, but the question says "the rate of gamma rays." So each decay emits two gamma rays, so the total number of gamma rays emitted per second is twice the number of decays per second.

Wait, no, actually, each decay emits one gamma ray of each type. So each decay corresponds to one gamma ray each. So if the activity is A, then the number of decays per second is A. So for each decay, two gamma rays are emitted. So the total gamma rays per second would be 2*A. 

Wait, but looking at the problem, the question asks for the rate of gamma rays, which is the number of gamma rays per second. So the activity is given, which is decays per second. So the number of gamma rays per second is 2 * A.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Each decay emits two gamma rays: 1.1 MeV and 1.3 MeV. So each decay corresponds to one gamma with each energy. So the number of gamma rays per second is 2 * A, where A is the activity in Bq (which is decays per second). 

But wait, the question is phrased as "rate of gamma rays incident on a patient is X *10^11 Bq." Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, "X*10^11 Bq" would be the number of gamma rays per second, but that's not correct. Because Bq is decays per second. So the rate of gamma rays would be 2 * A, which is 2 * 3.0e14 = 6e14 gamma rays per second.

But wait, the options don't have 6e14. So that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

"The rate of gamma rays incident on a patient... is X *10^11 Bq, what is X?"

Wait, that can't be. Because Bq is activity (decays per second), which is a count of decays, not gamma rays. So each decay emits two gamma rays. So the number of gamma rays per second is 2*A. 

But the question says the rate is X * 10^11 Bq. Wait, that would be in Bq units, but Bq is a measure of activity, not gamma rays. So I must have misread the question.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me re-examine the question. The question says, "the rate of gamma rays incident on a patient... is X *10^11 Bq." No, wait, no, that's not right. Because X *10^11 would be more like a count of gamma rays, but Bq is a rate, not a count. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of gamma rays per second, but expressed in terms of Bq's equivalent.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to approach it step by step.

So, the source emits gamma rays at 1.1 and 1.3 MeV per decay. Activity is 3.0e14 Bq. Each decay emits two gamma rays (one each at 1.1 and 1.3 MeV). So the number of gamma rays per second is 2 * 3e14 = 6e14. But wait, the options don't have 6e14. Let me look at the options.

Options are 10^11 scale: A to J, all in 1e11. So 6e14 is 600e12 or 600 *1e12, but the options are 1e11, so perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of the number of gamma rays per second. Let me think again.

The activity is the number of decays per second, which is 3e14. Each decay emits two gamma rays. So the number of gamma rays per second is 3e14 *2 =6e14.

But the question says, X *10^11 Bq. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because Bq is activity, not number of gamma rays. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, but assuming that's not the case, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the number of gamma rays (in terms of count) per second, which is 6e14. But none of the options are in the 1e13 or 1e14 range.

Wait, looking at the options, the largest is J:8.95e10. So perhaps the question is about the number of gamma rays per second, but expressed as X *10^11. Wait, but that would be 6e14 expressed in terms of 1e11: 6e14 = 60e12 = 600 *1e11. So X would be 600, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.

"The rate of gamma rays incident on a patient of area 0.30 m² located 4.0 m from the source is X *10^11 Bq, what is X?"

Wait, no, the question is about the rate of gamma rays emitted, not the absorbed. Because the patient is 4m away, so perhaps the question is about the number of gamma rays that reach the patient.

Oh! Right, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem isn't about the total number of gamma rays emitted by the source but the number that reach the patient.

So the question is about the number of gamma rays emitted by the source that actually reach the patient, so not all gamma rays from the source, but a certain fraction of them. Because the source is 4 meters away, and gamma rays are emitted in all directions, but the patient is a sphere of 0.3 m² area, which is a sphere of radius 0.15 meters.

Wait, no, wait. The area is 0.30 m². Hmm, wait, let me think about the geometry. The source emits gamma rays in all directions. The patient is a point at a distance of 4 m. So the gamma rays that reach the patient are those that pass through the patient. The source is a point, so the gamma rays that pass through the patient (area 0.3 m²) would be those emitted within a certain solid angle.

So the fraction of gamma rays emitted by the source that reach the patient is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the patient to the area of a sphere at that distance. But wait, actually, the area of a sphere is 4πr², but the patient is a flat area, so perhaps we should model it as a sphere.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of gamma rays that pass through the patient. So the number of gamma rays emitted by the source that reach the patient's body.

So first, the source is a point, but the patient is a sphere of radius r=4 m. The cross-sectional area of the patient is πr², but I think the question is giving the area as 0.3 m², so perhaps it's the effective area the gamma rays have to pass through.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the gamma rays emitted from the source are isotropic, so the fraction of them that reach the patient is (area of the patient) / (surface area of a sphere at 4m). But wait, the patient is a point, but the question gives an area, which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the area is the cross-sectional area (like, a circle with radius equal to the patient's radius). Wait, the patient is a sphere with area 0.30 m². Wait, the area of a sphere is 4πr², so if the area is 0.3 m², then the radius of the patient's cross-section would be r = sqrt(0.3/(4π)). Let me compute that.

Wait, but let me think step by step.

The source emits gamma rays isotropically (assuming isotropic emission). So the number of gamma rays emitted is A =3e14 Bq. Each decay emits two gamma rays. So the number of gamma rays emitted per second is 2 A =6e14.

Now, the question is how many of these reach the patient. The patient is a sphere at distance 4m. The gamma rays that reach the patient are those that pass through the patient's body. The probability of a gamma ray reaching the patient is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the patient to the area of a sphere at that distance.

Wait, but since the patient is a sphere, the cross-sectional area is π*(0.15)^2, and the sphere's surface area is 4π*(0.15)^2. So the ratio is (π*(0.15)^2)/(4π*(0.15)^2) ) = 1/4.

But wait, the problem says the area is 0.30 m². Wait, wait, that might be the cross-sectional area of the patient. So the patient's cross-section is 0.30 m², so the cross-sectional area is πr² =0.30 m². So r²=0.30/(π) → r≈sqrt(0.0955)=0.309 m. So the radius is about 0.31 meters.

So the cross-sectional area is 0.30 m², and the surface area of a sphere at 4 m is 4π(4)^2 = 64π m² ≈ 201.06 m².

So the fraction of gamma rays reaching the patient is (0.30)/(201.06) ≈ 0.001493.

So the number of gamma rays reaching the patient is 6e14 * 0.001493 ≈ 8.96e11.

Wait, but the question states that the rate is X *10^11 Bq. Wait, but again, Bq is activity, which is decays per second. So the question must be about the number of gamma rays per second. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of gamma rays emitted per second, not the number that reach the patient.

Wait, but the question says "the rate of gamma rays incident on the patient." So that would be the number of gamma rays per second that reach the patient. So earlier calculation gives approx 8.96e11, which is about 8.96 *1e11, so X is 8.96. Looking at the options, option J is 8.95.

Wait, but I'm getting 8.96e11. So the closest option is J:8.95.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation:

Number of gamma rays emitted per second: 2 * 3e14 =6e14.

Area of patient cross-section: 0.3 m².

Volume of sphere: (4/3)π r³. But no, wait, the area is 0.3 m², so radius r = sqrt(0.3/(π)) ≈ sqrt(0.0955) ≈0.309 m.

Surface area of a sphere at 4 m: 4π*(4)^2= 4π*16=64π≈201.06 m².

Fraction reaching patient: 0.3/(201.06)=0.001493.

Number of gamma rays reaching patient: 6e14 *0.001493 = 8.96e11. So X is 8.96, which is about 8.95, so option J.

But wait, the problem statement says "the rate of gamma rays incident on a patient", which is the number of gamma rays that reach the patient. So the correct answer should be J: 8.95. But let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:
A:7.65
B:5.50
C:11.20
D:6.25
E:9.85
F:12.30
G:3.90
H:4.75
I:10.40
J:8.95

So J is the correct one.

The problem involves determining the rate of gamma rays incident on a patient located 4.0 m from a 3.0 × 10¹⁴ Bq Co-60 source. Co-60 emits gamma rays at 1.1 MeV and 1.3 MeV per decay. The patient is a sphere with an area of 0.30 m², and the goal is to calculate the number of gamma rays per second that reach the patient.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Activity and Gamma Rays Emitted**:  
   The activity of the source is given as 3.0 × 10¹⁴ Bq. Each decay emits two gamma rays (1.1 MeV and 1.3 MeV), so the total number of gamma rays emitted per second is:  
   \[
   2 \times 3.0 \times 10^{14} = 6.0 \times 10^{14} \, \text{gamma rays/second}.
   \]

2. **Fraction of Gamma Rays Incident on the Patient**:  
   The patient is at a distance of 4.0 m. Assuming isotropic emission, the fraction of gamma rays that reach the patient is the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the patient to the surface area of a sphere at that distance. The cross-sectional area of the patient is given as 0.30 m², and the surface area of the sphere is:  
   \[
   4\pi(4)^2 = 64\pi \approx 201.06 \, \text{m}^2.
   \]  
   The fraction of gamma rays incident on the patient is:  
   \[
   \frac{0.30}{201.06} \approx 0.001493.
   \]

3. **Gamma Rays Incident on the Patient**:  
   The number of gamma rays incident on the patient is:  
   \[
   6.0 \times 10^{14} \times 0.001493 \approx 8.96 \times 10^{11} \, \text{gamma rays/second}.
   \]

4. **Matching the Options**:  
   The result, \(8.96 \times 10^{11}\), corresponds to \(X \times 10^{11}\) with \(X \approx 8.96\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(X = 8.95\).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **J: 8.95**.
