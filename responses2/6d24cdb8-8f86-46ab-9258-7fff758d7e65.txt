Okay, so I've got this question about superhero Captain Marvel's abilities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question asks which of the given options is NOT one of Captain Marvel's abilities. The options include a bunch of abilities like strength, endurance, insight, speed, courage, healing, agility, wisdom, power, and stealth.

First, I need to recall what Captain Marvel's powers are. From what I remember, she's one of the most famous superhero characters, so her abilities are quite well-known. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: the strength of Hercules. That sounds familiar. I think she has a lot of strength, especially against some enemies. Yes, she uses strength to fight and defeat various villains. So A is a capability.

Option B: the endurance of Atlas. Yeah, I believe she's really strong and can endure long periods of battle. So B is an ability.

Option C: the insight of Athena. Athena is a deity in Greek mythology. She's powerful and wise. In Captain Marvel's story, she has this insight, so I think she can access her knowledge. So C is an ability.

Option D: the speed of Hermes. Hermes is a太阳神, but in the Marvel story, Hermes is often associated with the Hulkbane Force, which allows heroes to move quickly. So D is definitely a strength she has.

Option E: the courage of Achilles. Achilles was a great athlete, so yes, he's known for his bravery. So E is an ability.

Option F: the healing of Asclepius. Asclepius is a figure of Athena, known for her healing abilities. She is a powerful, wise woman who can heal. So F is a capability.

Option G: the agility of Artemis. Artemis is another goddess known for her agility. She's often seen as a graceful warrior, which gives her agility. So G is an ability.

Option H: the power of Apollo. Apollo is the god of the sun, and in the Marvel story, he's the god of the sun and represents power and might, often associating with heroes. So H is a strength she has.

Option I: the power of Apollo. Wait, that's the same as option H. Oh, maybe there's a typo, but I think it's the same as H. So I is a capability.

Option J: the stealth of Hades. Hades is a Greek god of the sea, and in the Marvel story, Hades is a dangerous opponent. So Captain Marvel must have some stealth abilities. I think she uses stealth in combat, so J is an ability.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT one of her abilities. Let me double-check each. So the options are from A to J.

Wait, let me think again. Oh, I think I might have missed one. Let me go through each again.

A: strength of Hercules. Yes.

B: endurance of Atlas. Yes.

C: insight of Athena. Yes.

D: speed of Hermes. Yes.

E: courage of Achilles. Yes.

F: healing of Asclepius. Yes.

G: agility of Artemis. Yes.

H: power of Apollo. Yes.

I: power of Apollo. Same as H, so it's correct.

J: stealth of Hades. Yes.

Wait, so all the options are abilities except one. Did I miss any?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with one of the options. Let's see each one again.

Looking at the options again, I think all of them except one are her abilities. Oh wait, the options include each as separate options. Let me check each one.

Wait, let me think about each of them. For example, does she have the insight of Athena? Yes, I think that's correct. The ability to access her wisdom and insight.

Wait, but wait, the question says which is NOT one of her abilities. So perhaps one of the options is a non-herbal or non-heretic ability.

Wait, what about the 'healing of Asclepius'? Asclepius is a figure of Athena, but does she have healing abilities? Yes, as she's a powerful, healing woman.

Another thing: the 'power of Apollo'—Apollo as a god, so yes, she has that power.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, in the Marvel story, she has abilities like strength, speed, agility, wisdom, power, and she also has healing, but I might have missed a particular ability.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the options is not an ability. Let me think about each option.

Wait, the question lists J: the stealth of Hades. Hades is a sea god, so yes, she would need to have some stealth abilities to combat sea creatures, hence J is correct.

Wait, so all of the options are abilities except one. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think about each option once more.

Wait, the question is which is NOT one of her abilities. So I need to find the one that's not.

If all the options are her abilities, then perhaps I made a mistake in the list. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing one.

Wait, another approach: Let me think what each of these abilities refers to.

Strength: Yes, from Hercules.

Endurance: Yes, Atlas.

Insight: Yes, Athena.

Speed: Hermes.

Courage: Achilles.

Healing: Asclepius.

Agility: Artemis.

Power: Apollo.

Stealth: Hades.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, maybe I should check each option against my knowledge.

Wait, in the Marvel comics, Captain Marvel is known for her agility, strength, speed, wisdom, and power. She also has healing abilities, but does she have the insight of Athena? I think she does.

Wait, perhaps the 'healing of Asclepius' is not one of her abilities. Let me think: Asclepius is a figure of Athena, known for her healing abilities. So she is a great healer. So F is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach: perhaps some of the options are not in her abilities. Let me think about each:

A: Strength of Hercules – yes.

B: Endurance of Atlas – yes.

C: Insight of Athena – yes.

D: Speed of Hermes – yes.

E: Courage of Achilles – yes.

F: Healing of Asclepius – yes.

G: Agility of Artemis – yes.

H: Power of Apollo – yes.

I: Power of Apollo – same as H.

J: stealth of Hades – yes.

Wait, all the options seem to be abilities. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question. But wait, the question says "which is not one of her abilities." So perhaps I need to find the one that's not.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the options is incorrect. Another way to think: perhaps 'healing of Asclepius' is not an ability, because she is a warrior and has a lot of strength, but perhaps healing is more of a divine or other ability. Or maybe she doesn't have healing abilities.

Wait, but in the Marvel story, she does have healing abilities. She's a great healer, so F is correct.

Wait, but perhaps one of the options is not her. Let me think again. Maybe I'm missing an option.

Wait, the options given are A through J. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the count.

Wait, let me list all the options again:

A: strength of Hercules

B: endurance of Atlas

C: insight of Athena

D: speed of Hermes

E: courage of Achilles

F: healing of Asclepius

G: agility of Artemis

H: power of Apollo

I: power of Apollo (same as H)

J: stealth of Hades

Wait, that's 11 options, but the question lists only 10 (A-J). Wait, perhaps one of them is a trick.

Wait, perhaps one of the options is a mythological ability, but in the Marvel story, she doesn't have it. For example, she doesn't have the insight of Deus or something else. Alternatively, perhaps one of them is not a combat ability.

Wait, but then, perhaps I'm missing the 'healing of Asclepius' is not a combat or a heretic ability. Alternatively, perhaps 'healing' is not something she does. Wait, but in the story, she does have healing abilities.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about each ability.

Wait, another angle: perhaps 'healing of Asclepius' isn't one of her abilities. Because Asclepius is a figure of Athena, and she is a divine being. Maybe in the story, she doesn't have the ability to 'heal,' but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 'healing' is not a heretic ability, but then I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J, the stealth of Hades, because in the Marvel story, Hades is a dangerous opponent, and she needs to have some stealth to survive. So J is correct.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT one of her abilities. So perhaps one of the options is not a combat ability. Let me think: 'stealth of Hades'—Hades is a sea god, so she would need to have some stealth as a superhero.

Wait, perhaps the 'healing of Asclepius' is not an ability. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing one.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I forgot that she has 'the wisdom of Solomons' as an ability, but that wasn't an option. Oh wait, the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 'healing of Asclepius' is not one of her abilities.

Wait, I think I should look up in my knowledge. From what I recall, Captain Marvel does have all the abilities listed except perhaps one. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing an option.

Wait, another approach. Let me think of each ability:

Strength: Yes.

Endurance: Yes.

Insight: Yes.

Speed: Yes.

Courage: Yes.

Healing: Yes.

Agility: Yes.

Power: Yes.

Stealth: Yes.

So all options are abilities, which can't be because the question says one is not. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, perhaps the 'healing of Asclepius' is not an ability. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing one.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I forgot that she has 'the wisdom of Solomons' as an ability, but that wasn't an option. Oh wait, the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the 'healing of Asclepius' is not one of her abilities.

Wait, I think I should go with the option that is not an ability. Let me think again. The question is which is not one of her abilities. So I need to find the one that's not. I think the answer is J: the stealth of Hades, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: insight of Athena. No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J: stealth of Hades. But I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should think about her powers. She's a hero, she's strong, has agility, wisdom, speed, etc. She can heal, but maybe 'healing of Asclepius' is not an ability. Alternatively, perhaps she doesn't have the power of Apollo. But Apollo is her power.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J: stealth of Hades. Because Hades is a sea god, and in the Marvel story, Hades is a dangerous opponent, so she must have some stealth to survive.

Wait, but given that all the options are abilities except one, perhaps I'm missing the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G: agility of Artemis. No, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the answer is J. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F: healing of Asclepius. Wait, but I don't think she doesn't have healing abilities.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. I'm not entirely certain, but I'll have to choose. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, but no, she does have healing.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J: stealth of Hades. Because Hades is a sea god, and she'd need some stealth. So the answer is J.
