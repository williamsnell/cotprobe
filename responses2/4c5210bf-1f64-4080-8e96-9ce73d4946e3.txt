Okay, so I have this question about ideal gases and how pressure changes when temperature and volume change. Hmm, let me think. I remember something about the ideal gas law. Oh right! PV = nRT. 

The question says the temperature is increased by a factor of 2. So if the initial temperature is T, it becomes 2T. And the volume is increased by a factor of 8. So if V is the initial volume, it becomes 8V. And the problem is asking what happens to the pressure P.

Wait, how do I relate these changes? Oh, right! The ideal gas law relates P, V, T, and n. Since the number of moles, n, and the gas constant R are constant (I assume), I can write the equation before and after the change.

Initially, it's P₁V₁ = nR T₁. After the change, it's P₂ V₂ = nR T₂. But wait, I think I don't need to consider n and R because they cancel out. So, let me rearrange the equations.

Taking the ratio of the two equations:

(P₂ V₂) / (P₁ V₁) )= (T₂ T₁) / (T₂ T₁) )? Wait, no, wait: 

Wait, after the change, T is 2T₁ and V is 8V₁. So substituting:

P₂ * 8V₁ = nR * 2T₁

But from the initial equation, P₁ V₁ = nR T₁. So I can write nR T₁ as P₁ V₁.

Substituting into the equation after change:

P₂ * 8V₁ = 2P₁ V₁

Because nR T₁ = P₁ V₁. So yes, the nR T₁ term becomes P₁ V₁. So substituting that in:

P₂ *8V₁ = 2 * P₁ * V₁

Wait, V₁ cancels on both sides. So 8 P₂ = 2 P₁. So, solving for P₂:

P₂ = (2/8) P₁ = (1/4) P₁. So the pressure is a quarter of the original. So the pressure decreases by a factor of 4. 

Looking at the options, option G says P decreases by a factor of 4. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. If T is doubled and V is 8 times higher, what's the net effect on pressure? The ideal gas law says P is proportional to T and inversely proportional to V. So when T increases by 2 and V by 8, the pressure changes by (2/8) factor, which is 1/4. So yes, pressure decreases by 4 times. So option G is correct.

To determine how the pressure \( P \) of an ideal gas changes when the temperature is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased by a factor of 8, we use the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \). Since the number of moles \( n \) and the gas constant \( R \) are constant, the relationship simplifies to:

\[
\frac{P_2 V_2}{P_1 V_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Given:
- \( T_2 = 2T_1 \)
- \( V_2 = 8V_1 \)

Substituting these into the equation:

\[
\frac{P_2 \cdot 8V_1}{P_1 \cdot V_1} = \frac{2T_1}{T_1}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{8P_2}{P_1} = 2
\]

\[
P_2 = \frac{2}{8}P_1 = \frac{1}{4}P_1
\]

Thus, the pressure decreases by a factor of 4. Among the options, this corresponds to option **G: P decreases by a factor of 4**.
