Okay, so I've got this Python question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about x = 8 and what x>>1 equals in Python 3. Then, I have to choose the correct answer from the options A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in Python, the right shift operator is >>. But wait, in Python, integers are treated as signed, so that's important. But I'm not sure how it works exactly for positive numbers.

Wait, in Python, the >> operator is a bitwise shift. So for a positive integer like 8, shifting right by 1 would mean dividing by 2, right? Because shifting right by 1 is equivalent to integer division by 2. So 8 divided by 2 is 4.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. What does shifting work here? For example, when you do 8 >> 1, how does that work? Let me consider the binary representation of 8. 8 in binary is 1000. Shifting right by 1 would give 100, which is 4. So that's 4.

Looking at the options, 4 is option E. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh! Oh wait, wait. Oh no, wait a minute. Oh right! In Python, for signed integers, shifting right with >> can cause issues with negative numbers, but since 8 is positive, it's straightforward.

Wait, but wait, no, 8 is positive, so shifting right 1 would just be 4. So the answer is 4, which is option E.

The expression `x = 8` and `x >> 1` in Python 3 shifts the integer 8 to the right by 1 bit. Since 8 is positive, the result is 4. 

Answer: E
