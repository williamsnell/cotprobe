Question:

A farm and an orchard are adjoining tracts of land located in a county. In 2006, a farmer purchased the farm, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The orchard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the farm, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the farm under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the orchard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the orchard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the orchard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $250,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher farmer deed nor the farmer  investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the farm. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that both the farm and the orchard abut a public highway and that ingress and egress are afforded the investor by that highway. In an appropriate action by the investor to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the farm, she should

Options:

A: win, because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.
B: lose, because the right-of-way was abandoned inasmuch as there never was any actual use made.
C: lose, because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher.
D: lose, because the easement was not in use at the time of the sale to the investor.
E: lose, because the investor has reasonable access to the public highway without using the right-of-way.
F: win, because the investor has a right to access all parts of her property.
G: lose, because the easement was not specifically mentioned in the deed between the farmer and the investor.
H: win, because the right-of-way was never officially terminated.
I: win, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.
J: win, because the original deed clearly states the existence of the right-of-way.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a farmer and a rancher who bought adjacent tracts of land. The farm is a 10-acre fee simple absolute, and the orchard is a 20-acre east of it, also fee simple absolute. The rancher granted a way for egress and ingress (which I think means easement) to the farmer's right-of-way. This was done by deed and properly recorded. But the shepherd never used the easement. In 2010, the rancher sold the orchard to the farmer. Then the farmer sold the orchard to an investor in 2011. The investor says she has a right of way, and the farmer says there's no easement.

The question is about the investor's rights. The options are A to J, each making a different position. I need to determine which option is correct.

First, let me recall the basics of easements and easement rights. An easement is an improvement that gives the owner the right to use a piece of land for a specific purpose, like a road. It doesn't have to be damaged to use, and it doesn't need to be recorded. But for easement rights to take effect, the owner must have some use of the property. If someone doesn't use the easement, does that mean it's extinguished?

In this case, the rancher granted an easement. But the easement's right-of-way was only used by the owner of the farm, the farmer, because the rancher didn't use it. The question says the right-of-way was never used by anyone else. So, does that mean the easement is already gone?

Wait, another point is about the way the tracts are situated. Both the farm and orchard abut a public highway. So, the right-of-way (easement) might be that the farmer can use the highway to access his farm. But if the easement was created by the rancher, and the farmer never used it, does that mean the easement is no longer valid?

Wait, no. The easement was created before the farmer acquired the orchard. So the easement is the right of way established by the rancher. The farmer didn't use it, but the easement was created. So if the farmer didn't use the easement, doesn't that mean the easement is gone? Because for an easement to be in effect, the owner must have used it. But here, the easement was created, but doesn't the easement still exist? Or does it need someone else to use it to be valid?

Alternatively, if the easement is created but the owner doesn't use it, the easement might still be considered as being in effect. Because the easement's right is to use the property as per the grant. So maybe the easement is still in effect even if no one uses it, as long as the owner has some means to use it.

Wait, but in the scenario, the farmer never used the easement. But the rancher's right-of-way is what the farmer uses. So, the farmer's right is to use the highway to access the farm, but the easement was created by the rancher, and the farmer didn't use it. So, is the easement still valid?

In property law, an easement is a legal right of way. The right of way is the right to use the land. So if the easement was created, and the owner (the farmer) hasn't used it, the easement is still in effect because the owner has the right (the right of way) to use the land. So the easement isn't extinguished because the easement is the right to use the property, not necessarily to use it.

Wait, but another point: the question says the way was created by the rancher, and the farmer used the right-of-way to access the farm. So the right of way is given to the farmer. But the farmer never used the easement. So the easement is in effect, but the owner (farmer) hasn't used it. So the right of way is still there, but the use is not.

In the case of the right of way being created but never used, the easement is still in effect because the right of way exists. So the easement is a legal right, but it's not automatically extinguished. So the right of way is still valid.

But wait, the question is about the investor's rights. The farmer sold the orchard to the investor. The investor claims she has a right of way. The farmer says there's no easement.

Wait, but the easement was created by the rancher, and it's attached to the farm. The question says the way was executed by deed and properly recorded. So the easement is recorded.

But the right of way is created by the rancher, not the farmer. Wait, no, the way for egress and ingress (the easement) was created by the rancher, and the farmer used it to cross the right of way.

Wait, no. The way was granted to the shepherd, but the egress and ingress (the easement) was created by the rancher. So the way for egress and ingress was created by the rancher, but the way for crossing to the farm (right of way) was created by the farmer? Or wait, the problem says the right-of-way was created by the rancher? Let me check.

The question says: "A way for egress and ingress (the easement) was created by deed and properly recorded." So the easement was created by the rancher? Or by the farmer?

Wait, the problem says "a way for egress and ingress across the farm under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the farm was created." So the easement appurtenant to the farm was created by the rancher. So the easement is the right-of-way for the farm. But the farmer used this way to cross his right of way to the farm.

Wait, but the question says that the way (right of way) was created by the rancher and properly recorded, but the farmer never used it. So the right of way was created by the rancher, and the farmer used it to cross his right of way to the farm. So the farmer's right is to use the highway to access his own property. The right of way (easement) that the farmer created is for his right to use the highway to access his farm.

But the easement was created by the rancher. So if the farmer had the right to use the highway to access his farm, but the easement appurtenant to the farm was created by the rancher, meaning the easement is attached to the farm's right of way. So the easement appurtenant to the farm is the right-of-way (easement) that the farmer created.

So, the question is whether the easement appurtenant to the farm (the right-of-way) is extinguished because the rancher never used it.

In property law, an easement is a legal right of way that gives the owner the right to use the land. The right of way is the right to use the land, not necessarily the right to use it. So even if the owner never uses it, the right of way (the legal right to use the land) is still valid. Unless the owner uses it, which would extinguish the easement.

But in this case, the farmer did use it to access the farm. So if the farmer used the right of way (the easement) to access the farm, then the easement has been used, and therefore, it's no longer valid.

Wait, but the question says the right of way was created by the rancher, and the farmer never used it. So the right of way is still there because the right to use the land exists. But does the right to use the land (the easement) automatically extinguish because it's now in use by the farmer? Or does it still exist?

I think the right to use the land is the right of way. So the right of way is present because the owner has the right to use it. So the easement is still valid, provided the owner has the right to use it. But here, the owner (farmer) does use it. So the easement is extinguished.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased: the right of way was created by the rancher. The farmer used that right of way to cross his right of way to his farm. So the farmer's right is to use the highway to access his farm. But the easement appurtenant to the farm is the rancher's right of way, which the farmer used to cross his right of way.

But the question is whether the easement appurtenant to the farm is still in effect. If the farmer used the right of way (easement), then the easement is extinguished because the owner (farmer) used it. So the easement is no longer available for use. Therefore, the right of way (easement) is extinguished.

Wait, but the question says that the farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. But the investor is claiming she has a right of way. So, would the investor's right of way be subject to the same laws as the easement? The question is whether the easement exists or not. 

In the case of the farmer's right to use the highway, if the farmer used the right of way (easement) to cross his right of way to his farm, then the easement is extinguished. So the farmer's right to use the highway is gone because the farmer used it. Therefore, the easement is no longer available. So the right of way is extinguished, and the farmer can't use the highway to access his farm.

But the question is about the investor's rights. She claims she has a right of way. If the farmer's right to use the highway was extinguished, then the investor can't use the highway for her purposes. But the problem is that the farmer's right to use the highway was what allowed him to sell the orchard to the investor. So, if the farmer can't use the highway, then the investor can't access his land through the highway. But the question is about the right of way across the farm. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the right of way (easement) is for the farmer to use the highway to access his farm. But the farmer used it to cross his right of way to the farm. So, if the farmer used the right of way to cross to the farm, then the easement is no longer valid because the owner (farmer) used it. So the right of way (easement) is extinguished. Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway to access his land. So the right of way (easement) does not exist. So the farmer's right to use the highway is gone. So the investor can't use the highway for her purposes. But wait, the question is about the right of way across the farm. So, the farmer's right of way is the easement. But the farmer used it to cross his right of way, so the easement is gone. Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway, so the right of way across the farm is extinguished. So the investor can't use the right of way because the easement is gone.

Wait, but the question is whether the easement (appurtenant to the farm) exists. The farmer used it to cross to the farm, which means the easement is no longer valid. So the easement is extinguished. Therefore, the right of way across the farm is extinguished, so the farmer can't use it to access his farm. Therefore, the investor can't use the right of way to access her property, which is on the same tract as the farm.

But wait, the question is about the investor's rights. She claims she has a right of way. So, if the easement appurtenant to the farm is extinguished, then the farmer's right to use the highway is gone, so the investor can't use the highway to access her property (as far as the farmer and the rancher are concerned, but the question is about the right of way across the farm, which is the easement appurtenant to the farm). So the right of way across the farm is extinguished, so the farmer can't use it. Therefore, the investor can't use the right of way to access her property, which is on the same tract as the farm. So, does that mean the right of way (easement) is extinguished?

But in this case, the right of way was created by the rancher. The farmer used it to cross his right of way to the farm, so the easement is extinguished. Therefore, the right of way across the farm (appurtenant to the farm) doesn't exist. So, the farmer can't use the highway to access his farm, so the right of way is extinguished. Therefore, the farmer can't use the right of way to access her property either.

But wait, the question is about the investor's right of way. She claims she has a right of way. The problem is that the right of way appurtenant to the farm is extinguished because the owner (farmer) used it. So, the right of way (easement) is gone. Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway to access his land. So, the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone. Thus, the farmer can't use the right of way to access her property, so the right of way (easement) is gone, making the farmer unable to use the highway to access his land.

But wait, the question is about the right of way across the farm. If the easement appurtenant to the farm is gone, then the farmer can't use the highway because he can't access his farm. Therefore, the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone. Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway, which is the right of way across the farm. So, the right of way across the farm is extinguished, which means the farmer can't use it. So, the farmer can't use the highway, which is the right of way.

Wait, but the question is about the right of way across the farm, which is the easement appurtenant to the farm. So if the easement is extinguished, then the farmer can't use the highway to access his farm. So, the farmer can't use the right of way (easement) to access her property. But the question is whether the investor has a right of way. So, the farmer's right to use the highway is gone, so the right of way (easement) is extinguished. Therefore, the farmer can't use it, so the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone. Therefore, the farmer can't access her property via the right of way. But wait, the question is about the right of way across the farm. So, the farmer's right to use the highway is gone, so the right of way across the farm is gone. So, the farmer can't use it, but the investor's right of way is her claim. So, is the right of way appurtenant to the farm gone, making the farmer unable to use her right of way?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let's try to structure this:

1. The rancher granted an easement appurtenant to the farm (the right of way to the farmer) by deed. The easement is recorded.

2. The farmer used this right of way (easement) to cross his right of way to the farm. So, the easement is used, which would extinguish it. So the easement is gone.

3. The farmer's right to use the highway to access his farm is gone because the easement is extinguished.

4. The farmer sold the orchard to the investor. The farmer has no right of way to access his farm, so the farmer can't use the highway to access his own property or the investor's.

5. But the question is about the investor's right of way. She says she has a right of way. The farmer, however, says there's no easement. But the question is about the investor's rights, not the farmer's.

Wait, but the investor's right of way is the right of way appurtenant to her property. Her property is on the same tract as the farm, which is adjacent. So, the right of way appurtenant to her property is the same as the right of way appurtenant to the farm. If the easement appurtenant to the farm is gone, then the right of way appurtenant to her property is also gone. Therefore, she can't use the right of way to access her property.

But the investor's claim is that she has a right of way. If the easement appurtenant to the farm is gone, then she can't use it. So, the investor's right of way is extinguished.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let's look at the options again.

Option E: lose, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.

Hmm, no, the question is about the right of way across the farm. So, if the easement appurtenant to the farm is gone, then the farmer can't use the highway to access his property, which is adjacent to her property. Therefore, the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone. So, the farmer can't use her right of way.

But the options are about what the investor should do. Let's see.

The options are about whether the investor has a right to use her property. Her right of way is across the farm, which is the easement appurtenant to the farm. If the easement appurtenant to the farm is gone, then the farmer can't use her property.

So, the farmer can't use the right of way (easement) to access her property. So, the investor's right of way is extinguished. Therefore, the farmer can't use her right of way.

Wait, but in the options, option E says the investor acquired an easement by implication, which isn't right. Option G says the easement was extinguished by merger. No, the easement was created by the rancher, not merged.

Wait, in the scenario, the easement appurtenant to the farm was created by the rancher. The farmer used it to cross to his farm. So, the easement is gone because it's been used. Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway to access his property, so the right of way appurtenant to his property is gone. But she's on the same tract, so maybe the right of way appurtenant to her property is the same as the right of way appurtenant to the farm.

Wait, maybe I'm conflating the right of way appurtenant to the farm and to the property.

The right of way appurtenant to the farm is the easement created by the rancher. The right of way appurtenant to the property (the one the investor owns) is the easement created by the farmer. But the question is about the easement appurtenant to the farm. So, the easement appurtenant to the farm is the easement created by the rancher, which was used by the farmer to cross to his farm. So, the easement appurtenant to the farm is gone.

Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway to access her property. So the investor's right of way is gone.

But the options are about what the investor should do. So, the options are about the rights she has or doesn't have.

The options are:

A: win, right of way is extinguished

B: win, right of way exists

C: win, easement is extinguished

D: win, easement exists

E: lose, right of way is gone

F: win, easement exists

G: win, easement extinguished

H: lose, merger

I: lose, right of way

J: win, right of way

K: win, right of way

Wait, no. The options are about what the investor should do. So, the options are about the rights the investor has or doesn't have.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The rancher granted an easement appurtenant to the farm. The easement appurtenant to the farm is the easement created by the rancher. It was created by the rancher and recorded. The farmer used it to cross to his right of way to his farm. So, the easement appurtenant to the farm is used, so it's extinguished.

Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway to access his property. So, the farmer can't use the right of way (easement) to access her property either. But the question is about the right of way across the farm. So, if the easement appurtenant to the farm is gone, then the farmer can't use it to access his own property. So, the farmer can't use the right of way to access her property.

But the question is about the investor's rights. She wants to use her right of way. The farmer has informed her that there's no easement. But the question is about what the investor's rights are. So, the farmer's right to use the highway is gone, so the right of way across the farm is gone. So the investor can't use her right of way.

Wait, but the options are about what the investor should do. So, the options are about the rights the investor has or doesn't have.

The options are:

A: win, right of way is extinguished

B: win, right of way exists

C: win, easement is extinguished

D: win, easement exists

E: lose, right of way is gone

G: win, easement extinguished

H: lose, merger

I: lose, right of way

J: win, right of way

K: win, right of way

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the easement appurtenant to the farm is extinguished, so the farmer can't use the highway to access her property. Therefore, the investor can't use her right of way. So the farmer can't use the right of way to access her property, so the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone.

So the investor's right of way is gone. So the investor has no right of way. Therefore, option E: lose, right of way is gone.

Wait, but the options say:

E: lose, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.

No, that's not the case. The right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone. So, the farmer can't use the highway, so the right of way across the farm is gone. So, the farmer can't use it to access her property. Therefore, the investor can't use her right of way. So, the farmer can't use the right of way to access her property, so the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone.

Wait, but the farmer's right to use the highway is gone, so the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone. Therefore, the farmer can't use it to access her property. So, the farmer can't use her right of way. So, the farmer is now without a right of way. So, the farmer can't use the highway to access her property, so she can't use her right of way.

Wait, but the question is about the investor's rights. She says she has a right of way. The farmer says no easement. But the problem is about the investor's right of way. So, the farmer's right to use the highway is gone, so the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone. Therefore, the farmer can't use it to access her property, so she can't use her right of way. So, the farmer is now without a right of way. So, the farmer can't use the highway to access her property, so she can't use her right of way.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought before. So, if the farmer can't use the highway, then the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone, making the farmer unable to use her right of way. So, the farmer can't use her right of way, so the farmer is now without a right of way. Therefore, the investor can't use the right of way.

But the question is about the investor's rights. So, the investor's right of way is gone. Therefore, the farmer can't use the right of way to access her property. So, the farmer is now without a right of way. So, the farmer can't use the highway to access her property, so she can't use her right of way.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize:

1. Rancher grants easement appurtenant to the farm (right of way) by deed and recording.

2. Farmer uses the right of way to cross to his right of way to his farm. So, the easement appurtenant to the farm is used, so it's extinguished.

3. Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway to access his farm, which is adjacent to his investment.

4. But the question is about the farmer's right of way appurtenant to her property.

Wait, the right of way appurtenant to the farm is the easement appurtenant to the farm, which is gone. So, the farmer can't use the right of way appurtenant to her property. Therefore, the farmer can't use her right of way.

Wait, but the question is about the investor's rights. She says she has a right of way. But the farmer says there's no easement.

Wait, but the right of way appurtenant to the farm is the easement appurtenant to the farm, which is the easement created by the rancher, and that was used by the farmer to cross to his right of way to his farm. So, the easement appurtenant to the farm is used, so it's extinguished.

Therefore, the farmer can't use the highway to access his farm, which is adjacent to her investment. So, the farmer can't use the right of way appurtenant to her property. So, the farmer can't use her right of way.

But the question is about the investor's rights. She says she has a right of way. The farmer says no easement. So, the farmer's right to use the highway is gone, making the right of way appurtenant to the farm gone. Therefore, the farmer can't use her right of way.

Wait, but the options are about the rights the investor has. So, the options say:

I: lose, right of way is gone

E: lose, right of way is gone

So, the correct answer is E: lose, right of way is gone.

Wait, but the options are:

A: win, right of way is extinguished

B: win, right of way exists

C: win, easement is extinguished

D: win, easement exists

E: lose, right of way is gone

G: win, easement extinguished

H: lose, merger

I: lose, right of way

J: win, right of way

K: win, right of way

So, option E says the investor loses because the right of way is gone.

Yes, that's correct. So, the right of way appurtenant to the farm is gone. Therefore, the farmer can't use it to access her property, so she can't use her right of way. Therefore, the investor loses because the right of way is gone.

So, the correct answer is E: lose, right of way is gone.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: lose, right of way is gone**.

### Explanation:

1. **Right of Way Appurtenant to the Farm**: The rancher granted an easement appurtenant to the farm (the right of way to the farmer) by deed and recorded. This easement appurtenant to the farm was the easement created by the rancher.

2. **Farmright of Way Usage**: The farmer used this easement appurtenant to the farm (the right of way to the farmer) to cross his right of way to his farm. This usage extinguishes the easement appurtenant to the farm, making it unavailable for the farmer to access his property.

3. **Impact on the Farmer's Right of Way**: The farmer's right of way to access his property was extinguished, meaning the farmer can no longer use the highway to access his farm. Consequently, the farmer cannot use the right of way appurtenant to her property.

4. **Investor's Rights**: The investor's claim to use her right of way is unaffected because the farmer no longer has the right of way to access her property. Therefore, the investor loses because the right of way is gone.

### Conclusion:
The farmer's right of way appurtenant to her property is gone, so the investor loses because the right of way is gone.
