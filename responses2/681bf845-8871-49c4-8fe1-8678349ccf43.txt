Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the mass of water needed to make a 0.25 molal solution when 293 grams of NaCl is added. The options are various kilograms, so I need to calculate the correct mass of water.

Hmm, molality is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Oh wait, right, molality (m) is moles of solute divided by kilograms of solvent. So in this case, the solute is NaCl, and the solvent is water.

So the formula would be m = moles of solute / kg of solvent. I need to find the kg of water, so I should rearrange the formula. Let me write that down.

m = (moles of NaCl) / (kg H2O)
I know m is 0.25 mol/kg, and the moles of NaCl can be calculated since I know its formula weight is 58.5 g/mol.

Wait, the mass of NaCl is given as 293 grams. So moles = mass (g) / formula weight (g/mol). Let me calculate that.

Moles of NaCl = 293 g / 58.5 g/mol. Let me compute 293 divided by 58.5. Let's see, 58.5 times 5 is about 292.5. Oh wait, 58.5 *5 = 292.5. So 293 is just a tiny bit more than 5. So approximately 5.0085 moles? Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

58.5 * 5 = 292.5. 293 -292.5 = 0.5 g left. So 0.5 g is how many moles? (0.5 g) /58.5 g/mol ≈ 0.00855 moles. So total moles is approximately 5.00855 moles.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 293 divided by 58.5. Let me do this division more accurately.

58.5 * 5 = 292.5. So 5 is 292.5, and 293 is 0.5 more. So 0.5 /58.5 = 0.008547. So total is 5.008547 moles.

So moles of NaCl ≈ 5.00855 mol.

Now, using the molality formula: m = 5.00855 mol / (kg H2O) ) = 0.25 mol/kg.

So kg of H2O is = moles of NaCl / m.

So kg H2O = 5.00855 / 0.25.

Let me compute that: 5.00855 / 0.25 is 20.0342 kg.

Wait, that's around 20 kg. Let me double-check my calculations because the options have 20 kg as option C.

So the answer would be option C: 20 kg H2O.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recount.

Moles of NaCl: 293g /58.5 g/mol = approx 5.00855.

Molality m = 0.25 = (5.00855) / x, where x is kg H2O.

So x = 5.00855 / 0.25 = 20.0342 kg. So approximately 20 kg.

So the correct answer should be 20 kg. Looking at the options, option C is 20 kg H2O. So I think that's the correct choice.

To determine the mass of water needed to prepare a 0.25 molal solution when 293 g of NaCl is added, we use the definition of molality:

\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}}
\]

Here, the mass of NaCl is 293 g, and its formula weight is 58.5 g/mol. First, calculate the moles of NaCl:

\[
\text{Moles of NaCl} = \frac{\text{mass of NaCl}}{\text{formula weight of NaCl}} = \frac{293}{58.5} \approx 5.00855 \, \text{mol}
\]

Substitute into the molality formula to find the mass of water:

\[
0.25 = \frac{5.00855}{\text{kg H}_2\text{O}}
\]

\[
\text{kg H}_2\text{O} = \frac{5.00855}{0.25} \approx 20.0342 \, \text{kg}
\]

The closest option to this calculated value is **20 kg H₂O**, which corresponds to option C.
