Question:

All walking animals, including humans, have a natural walking pace—a number of steps per minute that is more comfortable than a faster or slower pace. Suppose that this pace corresponds to the oscillation of the leg as a physical pendulum.  Fossil evidence shows that T. rex, a two-legged dinosaur that lived about 65 million years ago, had a leg length L = 3.1 m and a stride length S = 4.0 m (the distance from one footprint to the next print of the same foot).  Estimate the walking speed of T. rex. (Unit: m/s)

D: 1.8
E: 1.1
F: 0.9
G: 2.2
H: 2.5
I: 3.0

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about T. rex's walking speed. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a go.

The question says that walking animals, including humans, have a natural walking pace which is an oscillation like a physical pendulum. The model is probably a simple pendulum, right? So, they're treating the leg as a physical pendulum with a certain length.

The given data: T. rex has a leg length L = 3.1 meters. Stride length S is 4.0 meters. Stride length is the distance between two consecutive footprints, so that's the number of steps multiplied by the stride length per step. Wait, stride length is the distance from one foot to the next, which is the same as the stride frequency's oscillation.

I remember that for a pendulum, the period (time to complete one full swing) is given by T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length. But wait, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. The problem says it's an oscillation of the leg, so maybe the period relates to the time between steps. Oh, wait, the stride length S is the distance covered in one step. So, the stride rate (steps per second) would be S divided by the period T. Because each step takes time T, so steps per second is 1/T.

Wait, but if the leg's stride corresponds to the period, then maybe the number of steps per unit time is 1/T. So, if the stride length is S, then the period T is the time for one stride, and the number of strides per second is S / T. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem is about the oscillation. So, the leg's movement could be modeled as a pendulum, which has a certain period. So, maybe the time between leg movements (like a step) is the period of the pendulum. So, T is the period, which is the time for one full stride.

But wait, the stride length (S) is the distance covered in each stride (one step). So, if the stride period is T, then the speed would be S divided by T. Because speed is distance over time. So, speed v = S / T.

Because the stride's length is S, and each stride takes time T, so speed is S/(T).

Wait, but how to find T? Because the leg's movement as a pendulum has a certain natural frequency. So, perhaps the oscillation frequency is determined by some physical factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the leg's motion is modeled as a physical pendulum, so its period is T = 2π√(L/g), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're assuming the leg's period is the same as the oscillation period. So, using the formula for the period of a physical pendulum for a simple pendulum, which is T = 2π√(L/g). But wait, that's the period of a simple pendulum, which is indeed what they're treating the leg as. So maybe L is the leg's length, and g is 9.8 m/s².

So, let's compute T. L is 3.1 m.

T = 2 * π * sqrt(L/g) = 2 * 3.1416 * sqrt(3.1 / 9.8)

Calculating the sqrt part: 3.1 / 9.8 ≈ 0.3163. The square root of that is about 0.5625.

Multiply by 2 pi: 2 * 3.1416 * 0.5625 ≈ 3.5448 meters.

Wait, wait, no. The period is in seconds. So, T ≈ 3.5448 seconds.

Wait, but wait, if the leg's period is 3.5448 seconds, then the number of strides per second is 1 / T. So, the stride frequency is f = 1/T ≈ 1/3.5448 ≈ 0.282 steps per second.

The stride length is 4.0 meters, so the speed would be S * f. So, v = 4.0 m * 0.282 ≈ 1.128 m/s.

Looking at the options, I don't see 1.128. The closest is option E: 1.1 and option J: 2.8. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate T.

Compute T = 2 * π * sqrt(L/g) 

L=3.1 m, g=9.8 m/s².

sqrt(3.1/9.8) = sqrt(0.3163) ≈ 0.5625.

2 * π * 0.5625 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 0.5625.

3.1416 * 0.5625 ≈ 1.767. Multiply by 2: about 3.534 seconds. So T≈3.534 s.

So, the number of strides per second is 1 / 3.534 ≈ 0.283.

Multiply by S=4.0 m: 4 * 0.283 = 1.132 m/s. Hmm, but the options don't have 1.13. The closest is E (1.1) and J (2.8). Wait, did I make a mistake in the model?

Alternatively, perhaps they model the leg's motion as a pendulum with a length equal to the leg's length. So, the period T is 2π√(L/g). Then, if the stride is one T period, then the speed is S / T.

Wait, wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again. The stride length S is the distance covered in one full stride, which takes time T. So, speed is distance over time: v = S / T.

In that case, T is the period of the leg's swing, which is the same as the time between leg movements. So, if the leg's period is T, then the number of strides per second is 1/T. So, the speed would be 4 m * (1/T) = 4/T m/s.

But wait, no. Because each stride is S meters, and it takes T seconds. So, v = S / T.

So, in that scenario, v = 4 / (2π√(L/g)).

Let me compute that.

v = 4 / (2 * π * sqrt(3.1 / 9.8)).

Compute denominator: 2 * π is approx 6.283. sqrt(3.1/9.8) ≈ 0.5625, so 6.283 * 0.5625 ≈ 3.534. So, denominator is 3.534.

So, v = 4 / 3.534 ≈ 1.132 m/s.

Hmm, but again, the options don't have this value. The closest is E (1.1) and J (2.8). So maybe I made a mistake in the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the leg's stride is the same as the period. So, the period T is equal to the stride length S. Wait, no, because stride length is the distance between two footprints, which would correspond to the number of steps multiplied by the stride length per step. So, S = n * stride length per step, where n is the number of steps per second (frequency). Hmm, perhaps I should model this as S = f * T, where f is the frequency of the stride. Since T is the period of the leg's movement. Wait, because the leg's movement is periodic, so each stride takes time T. So, the frequency f = 1/T. The stride length S is the distance covered in each stride, so S = f * T * stride_length_per_step? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Each stride is a single step. So, each stride is a single movement of the leg. So, the stride length S is the distance covered in one stride. So, if the leg's period is T (time between each stride), then the number of strides per second is 1/T. So, the speed v is S * (1/T) = S/(T). So, v = S / T.

But again, T is 2π√(L/g), and S is 4.0 m.

So, v = 4 / (2 * π * sqrt(3.1/9.8)).

Wait, computing that again:

2 * π is about 6.2832.

sqrt(3.1 /9.8) = sqrt(0.3163) ≈ 0.5625.

6.2832 * 0.5625 ≈ 3.534.

So, v = 4 / 3.534 ≈ 1.132 m/s. Which is approximately 1.13 m/s.

Looking at the options, E is 1.1 and J is 2.8. So, but 1.13 is closer to E than any other option. Therefore, the answer would be option E (1.1).

Wait, but wait another point. Maybe I should consider that the leg's movement is an oscillation, so perhaps the period is the same as the time between footprints, but perhaps the stride length is S = f*T, but I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the stride length is related to the period. So, perhaps v = S * (1/T) as I thought earlier. But that's what's happening. So, perhaps the answer is E (1.1).

But wait, the problem says to treat the leg as a physical pendulum. So perhaps the leg's movement is modeled as a simple pendulum, and the period is T=2π√(L/g). Then, the stride is one period, so the leg's movement is a full swing back and forth, which covers the leg length L. So, in that case, the period T is the time for a single full stride, which is the time taken to go from one foot to the other and back.

Wait, no. Because when you take a stride, the leg swings forward, then returns. So, the period T is time to go from one foot to the other and back, meaning one full cycle. So, the leg's movement is a full oscillation, which takes T seconds.

In that case, the speed v would be the distance covered in that time. So, the stride length is S, but for each full oscillation, the leg moves from one foot to the other and back again. So, the distance covered in one full oscillation is 2*S (since each footstep is S, so going and coming again would be 2*S).

Wait, that's a key point. So, if the leg's movement is modeled as a physical pendulum, then the period is the time to make one full back-and-forth. So, the leg length is L, and the period T is the time for one full oscillation.

But wait, if the leg's stride is the distance between two footprints, then in one stride, the leg moves from one foot to the next and back. So, in one full oscillation, the leg moves 2*S meters? Or is it S per stride. Hmm, that's a point of confusion.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the leg's movement as a simple pendulum. So, each stride is a full oscillation of the leg. Hence, in each stride, the leg swings forward and back, which would be a full period. So, the leg's movement is a simple pendulum, which takes T seconds for one full period.

In that case, the total distance covered in one stride is twice the leg length—because it goes forward L and back L. So, the stride length S is the distance from one foot to the other, which is the same as the leg length. So, each stride is a full oscillation, which is a distance of 2L, but that doesn't match the given S=4.0 m. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the stride length is equal to the leg length. Because, if the leg is L=3.1 m, and the stride is S=4.0 m, which is longer than L. That seems odd. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the stride length is the distance covered in each step, which is the same as the leg's stride. So, for a pendulum, each oscillation (a full swing) would correspond to leg movement, which is a forward and backward movement of the leg. So, the leg's movement is like a full swing, which would be a distance of 2L (forward and backward). But wait, in that case, the stride length would be the leg's length, so S=L. But in the problem, S=4.0 m and L=3.1 m. So, that doesn't fit. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the leg's movement is modeled as a pendulum, but the stride is a single forward and backward movement. So, each stride (one step) is a full period, which is 2π√(L/g). So, the distance covered in one stride (S) is equal to the leg's length, L. But in our case, S is 4.0 m and L is 3.1 m, which doesn't match. So, perhaps this model isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the stride length is the distance covered in one full swing, which is the leg's movement. So, S = L, which is 3.1 m. But the given S is 4.0 m, which doesn't match. So, that model doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine the initial approach. Let's think of the leg's movement as a simple pendulum, so the period T is 2π√(L/g), as I did before. The stride length S is the distance between two consecutive footprints, which would be the distance covered in one full oscillation. But wait, that's the same as the leg's movement period. So, the leg moves a distance of L (from one foot to the other), which is the leg length, but the stride length is 4.0 m. That doesn't add up.

Hmm, maybe the stride length is the distance between two footprints, which is the same as the leg's length. So, in that case, L would be 4.0 m, but given L=3.1 m. Doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this step by step.

The problem states that the leg's movement is modeled as a pendulum. So, the leg's period T is the time for a full oscillation (forward and back). So, the period is T = 2π√(L/g).

Now, the stride length is the distance from one foot to the next. So, each stride is a single forward and backward motion. So, the leg length is L. The stride length S would be the same as L, but in the problem, S=4.0 m and L=3.1 m, which is a discrepancy. So, perhaps that's not the correct model.

Alternatively, perhaps each stride is a single swing, so the leg moves forward L, and the stride length is L. But that would mean that S=L, which is not the case here. So, perhaps the model isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the stride length is S=4.0 m, which is the distance for a single forward and backward swing. So, the leg is moving forward 4.0 m in one full period.

Wait, that doesn't make sense either because the leg length is 3.1 m. So, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the stride length is the distance covered in the entire period, which is one full swing (forward and backward). So, the leg's length is L, and each full oscillation is 2*L. But then, the stride length S would be 2*L. But the problem states S=4.0 m and L=3.1 m. So 2*3.1=6.2, which is larger than 4.0. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think in terms of the horse's stride. In a horse, each stride is a forward movement and a return movement, so the distance covered is 2 times the leg length. So, the stride length would be 2L. So, in that model, S = 2L.

In our problem, S=4.0 m. So, 2L = 4.0 m → L=2.0 m. But the given L is 3.1 m. So, that's not matching. So, perhaps that's not the model either.

Alternatively, perhaps the stride length is the leg's length, S = L, but that doesn't match the given S=4 m. So, that's not it.

Maybe I'm getting stuck on this. Let me try to think of the problem another way.

The problem says that the leg's movement is like a pendulum. So, the leg's period T is 2π√(L/g). The stride frequency is f = 1/T. The number of strides per second is f.

Each stride's length is S. So, the distance covered in each stride is S. So, the speed v is S * f = S / T.

So, v = S / (2π√(L/g)).

Let me compute that.

v = 4.0 m / (2 * π * sqrt(3.1 / 9.8)).

Compute denominator:

sqrt(3.1/9.8) = sqrt(0.3163) ≈ 0.5625.

2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

So, 6.2832 * 0.5625 ≈ 3.534.

So, v = 4.0 / 3.534 ≈ 1.13 m/s.

Looking at the options, E is 1.1 and J is 2.8. The closest is E (1.1). So, the answer would be E.

Wait, but why isn't it matching the leg's stride length? Because, in this model, the stride length is S, which is 4 m. But in this model, the leg's movement is a full oscillation, so in one full period, the leg would have moved forward and back. So, the distance covered in one oscillation is 2L. So, the stride length in this model would be 2L, which would make S=2L. But in the problem, if S=4, then 2L=4 → L=2. But given L=3.1 m, which is not matching. So, perhaps this model is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the stride length is the same as the leg's length. So, S=L. But in the problem, S=4, L=3.1. So, that doesn't fit. So, perhaps that's not the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the leg's movement is a full swing, which is a distance of L. So, the stride length is L. But in the problem, S=4, L=3.1. So, that doesn't fit. So, perhaps this model is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should consider the leg's movement as a simple pendulum, and the stride's length is the distance covered in one full swing, which is 2L. So, the stride length S = 2L.

In this case, L would be S/2 =4/2=2 m. So, L=2 m. But the given L is 3.1 m. So, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the leg's movement isn't a full oscillation but a single forward and return, which is one full oscillation. So, the stride length S is 2L.

Thus, S = 2L → L = S/2 =4/2=2 m. But given L=3.1 m, which doesn't fit.

This suggests that perhaps the model is incorrect. So, perhaps the leg's movement is not a full oscillation, but a single forward movement, which would correspond to a stride length of L. But then, the stride would only be L, but the problem says S=4.0 m.

This is a bit confusing. But perhaps, given that the given options don't have a value close to 1.13, I should look at the answer choices again.

Looking at the options: the closest is E (1.1). So, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, but I'm also considering that perhaps the stride length is equal to the leg's length, which would make S=L. But in that case, the stride would be 3.1 m, but the problem states S=4.0 m. So, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the stride length is the distance covered in the leg's swing, which is S=2L. So, with L=3.1 m, S=6.2 m. But the problem says S=4.0 m. No, that doesn't fit.

So, I'm stuck again. I think perhaps I should proceed with the calculation I did earlier, getting v≈1.13 m/s, which would match option E (1.1) or J (2.8). Since 1.13 is closer to 1.1 than to 2.8, I would choose option E.

But wait, another thought. If the leg's movement is a simple pendulum, then the period T is 2π√(L/g). The stride is the distance covered in one full oscillation, which is 2L. So, the stride length S = 2L. So, in this case, L = S/2 =4/2=2 m. So, L=2 m. But the given L is 3.1 m, so that's not matching. So, I think this model is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the stride length is the same as the leg's length. So, in that case, S=L=3.1 m. But the problem states S=4 m. So, that doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm not correctly modeling the leg's movement as a simple pendulum. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the information given without overcomplicating the model.

Another approach: Let's compute the leg's period using the given leg length, then compute the stride speed using the given stride length. But perhaps the stride length is related to the leg's period.

Wait, if the leg's period is T=2π√(L/g), then the stride length S is equal to T * v. So, v = S / T.

Wait, that's another approach. Let's compute T first.

T = 2 * π * sqrt(L / g).

L=3.1 m, g=9.8 m/s².

Compute sqrt(3.1/9.8).

3.1 divided by 9.8 is approximately 0.3163.

Square root of 0.3163 is approximately 0.5625.

Multiply by 2 * π: 2 * 3.1416 * 0.5625.

2 * 3.1416 = 6.2832.

6.2832 * 0.5625 ≈ 3.534.

So, T≈3.534 seconds.

Now, the stride length is given as S=4.0 m.

The speed v = S / T.

v = 4.0 / 3.534 ≈ 1.132 m/s.

So, the answer is approximately 1.13 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E (1.1) m/s.

So, the correct answer is option E.
</think>

To estimate the walking speed of T. rex, we treat the leg's movement as a simple pendulum. The period of a simple pendulum is given by:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
\]

where:
- \( L = 3.1 \, \text{m} \) (leg length),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \).

Computing \( T \):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{3.1}{9.8}} = \sqrt{0.3163} \approx 0.5625
\]
\[
T = 2\pi \times 0.5625 \approx 3.534 \, \text{s}
\]

The stride length \( S = 4.0 \, \text{m} \). Assuming each stride corresponds to the leg's period, the walking speed \( v \) is:

\[
v = \frac{S}{T} = \frac{4.0}{3.534} \approx 1.132 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Among the options, the closest value to 1.13 m/s is **E (1.1 m/s)**.

ANSWER: E
