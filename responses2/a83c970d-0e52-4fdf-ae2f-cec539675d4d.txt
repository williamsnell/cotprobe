Alright, so I've got this question here about gas volume changes. Let's see what it's about. Okay, the question says a gas occupies 100 ml at 20°C, and I need to find its volume at 10°C when the pressure remains constant. The options are A to J, and I have to pick the right one. 

Hmm, I remember something about gas laws. Oh right, Charles's Law. Charles's Law states that volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature when pressure is constant. So the formula is V1/T1 = V2/T2, where T is in Kelvin.

Wait, but wait. Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So the initial temperature is 20°C, so that's 293.15 K. The new temperature is 10°C, which is 283.15 K. 

Let me plug the numbers into the formula. V1 is 100 ml, T1 is 293.15 K. V2 is what we're looking for, and T2 is 283.15 K. So the equation becomes 100 / 293.15 = V2 / 283.15.

Wait, no, more accurately, V1 / T1 = V2 / T2. So V2 = (V1 * T2) / T1.

Let me compute that. So V2 = (100 * 283.15) / 293.15.

Let me calculate that. 

First, 283.15 divided by 293.15 is approximately 0.964. So 100 multiplied by 0.964 is about 96.4 ml. 

Looking at the options, I see option I is 96.6 ml. That's pretty close. Let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Wait, another way: 283.15 divided by 293.15 is (283.15)/(293.15) = approximately 0.964. So 100 * 0.964 is 96.4. So 96.4 ml. The closest option is I, 96.6 ml. So that's probably the correct answer. 

I think I should double-check the calculations. Alternatively, suppose I compute the ratio of the temperatures. 283.15 / 293.15 is approximately 0.964. Multiplying by 100 gives 96.4. So yes, the volume decreases by about 3.6%. That makes sense because as temperature decreases, volume decreases, assuming pressure is constant. 

Wait, wait a second. Wait, wait: wait, wait. No, wait. Charles's Law is V1/T1 = V2/T2. So if the temperature decreases, V2 should be less than V1. So 10°C is lower than 20°C, so volume should decrease. So from 100 to about 96.4 ml. 

Looking back at the options, option I is 96.6 ml, which is about what I got. So that should be correct. The other options don't seem to fit. 

So the answer is I, 96.6 ml.

To determine the new volume of the gas at 10°C when the pressure remains constant, we use Charles's Law: \( \frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} \). Here, \( V_1 = 100 \, \text{ml} \), \( T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C} = 293.15 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_2 = 10^\circ \text{C} = 283.15 \, \text{K} \). Rearranging the formula gives:

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_2 = 100 \cdot \frac{283.15}{293.15} \approx 100 \cdot 0.964 = 96.4 \, \text{ml}.
\]

The closest option is **96.6 ml**, which corresponds to option I.
