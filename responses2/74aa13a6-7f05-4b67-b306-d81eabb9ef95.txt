At the grand jury, a witness was asked the following question by the prosecuting attorney: "Is it not true that 20 minutes after the accident you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light?" He answered, "Yes. "The defendant was also subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. The defendant was represented by counsel at the grand jury hearing. During questioning he was shown the witness's statement from his testimony. No objection was made to the introduction of the witness's statement. At the defendant's trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce into evidence the witness's statement from the deposition taken at the grand jury hearing.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about hearsay and evidence introduction. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario: A defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter for causing a vehicular homicide. A grand jury was called, and some witnesses were subpoenaed. Then, a witness was questioned by the prosecuting attorney. The witness said that 20 minutes after the accident, he told the police the defendant's car went through a red light. The defendant was also called for testimony before the grand jury. The attorney representing the defendant objected to introducing the witness's statement. Now, the question is about what the defendant's attorney's objection would be granted or denied.

I remember that hearsay is a statement that is made by a third party and is admissible only if it meets certain criteria. There are exceptions like the statement by a witness (which is hearsay not within an exception) but also other hearsay rules like the requirement that the statement must be made in good faith or that the statement was made under oath.

So the key points here are:
1. The statement was made by a witness at the grand jury.
2. The defendant's attorney objecting to its introduction.
3. The defendant was cross-examined by counsel at the grand jury hearing.

Hearsay exceptions include the statement by a witness (which is "admissible in evidence" only if it's made under oath or if the statement was made a good faith or in connection with a legally required or necessary act). However, in some cases, if the statement is made in good faith and is connected with another act, it might be admissible even without being under oath. But wait, in this case, the witness was being questioned, and the defendant's attorney is objecting. 

The defendant's attorney is objecting because the statement was made by a witness during a grand jury. But I think grand juries are not the same as regular juries. Grand juries are typically for the purpose of making a verdict, not for the purpose of a declaration of guilt or innocence. So, the statement was made by a witness under the grand jury, which is a separate proceeding.

Wait, but in the context of a grand jury, the statement was made during an admission, because the grand jury is a formal legal proceeding. So, if the statement was made during a formal legal proceeding, it is admissible. But wait, the defendant's attorney is objecting, so maybe the statement isn't admissible because it was made under the grand jury, which is not the same as a regular trial.

Wait, that might be a point to consider. In a regular jury trial, a statement from a witness is admissible only if it was made under oath. But in a grand jury, the statement is made during a formal proceeding, so it's not under oath. But does that make it admissible? I think yes, because the statement is a statement of fact made by the witness during a formal proceeding. So perhaps the statement is admissible even without being under oath, which would mean that the defendant's attorney's objection might be granted.

Wait, but then again, the question says that the defendant's attorney objected at the grand jury hearing and the witness's testimony was not questioned. So the witness's statement was presented at the grand jury. In a grand jury, the statement is admissible as a statement of fact only if it was made under the grand jury. So if the witness's statement was made under the grand jury, it's admissible.

But wait, in the trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce the witness's statement again. So the defendant's attorney objects to it. Now, the question is whether the statement is hearsay.

So, let me think about the hearsay rules again. The hearsay rule requires that the statement be made by a third party and not be admissable without an exception. But the statement is made by the witness, which would normally require that it be under oath or that it's an exception.

Wait, but the statement was made during the grand jury, which is a formal proceeding. So, the fact that it's made during a formal proceeding (like a grand jury) might mean that it's admissible as a statement of fact without being under oath. Because the grand jury is a separate proceeding, and it's a requirement for the verdict.

But in the trial, the witness is being questioned at the grand jury hearing. So when the witness is being questioned, the statement is made under the grand jury, which is a formal proceeding. So the statement is admissible.

Wait, but in the case of a grand jury, the statement is made under the grand jury, so the statement is admissible as a statement of fact without being under oath. So the defendant's attorney's objection might be granted.

But wait, another angle: the grand jury is a formal proceeding, but the statement might not be hearsay unless it's made under oath. So the witness's statement was made during the grand jury, which is a separate proceeding, so it's admissible.

Wait, but the options include options where the objection is denied because the statement was made during a formal proceeding. Option A says it's admissible because it was made in formal legal proceeding. So in that case, the defendant's attorney's objection would be granted, so the objection is denied.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me see. The witness was being questioned during the grand jury. The statement from the witness was made under the grand jury, which is a separate proceeding. So the statement is admissible as a statement of fact made by a witness under a formal proceeding. So the defense would lose, and the objection is granted.

Wait, but let me read the options again. The options are:

A: Denied because made in formal proceeding, admissible.

B: Grant because the questioning was leading.

C: Grant because it's hearsay not in exception.

D: Grant because the witness's testimony could prejudice.

E: Grant because not made under oath.

F: Denied because attorney didn't object in grand jury.

G: Denied because didn't cross-examine properly.

H: Denied because didn't object that witness's testimony was hearsay.

I: Denied because given an opportunity to cross-examine.

J: Grant because the statement is irrelevant.

Wait, so the options are about whether the objection is granted.

So, the witness's statement was made under the grand jury which is a formal proceeding. So the statement is admissible. Therefore, the defendant's attorney's objection is denied, as the statement is admissible. But wait, the options include option A which says the statement is admissible because made in formal legal proceeding.

Wait, but in the context of a grand jury, the statement is not considered a hearsay because it's made under a formal proceeding. So the statement is admissible, which would mean the objection is granted (so the defendant's attorney doesn't object, so the objection is granted, making the answer denied).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The grand jury is a formal proceeding, so any statement made during that is admissible as a statement of fact without being under oath. So the witness's testimony is admissible. Therefore, the defendant's attorney's objection is denied, meaning the statement is admissible. So the correct option would be A, which says it's admissible because made in formal legal proceeding.

Wait, but I thought that in a regular jury trial, the statement from a witness is not admissible unless under oath. But in a grand jury, it's a different case. So, the statement is made under a formal proceeding, so it's admissible as a statement of fact without being under oath. Therefore, the objection is granted (i.e., the statement is admissible), so the defendant's attorney's objection is denied.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the statement is admissible because it was made in a formal proceeding. So the objection is denied, so the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck, because in some cases, the grand jury's statement is not admissible. For example, if the statement was made by the defendant, but the witness's statement is from the opponent. But in this case, the witness is being questioned, not the defendant. So the witness's statement is being offered to support the prosecution, which would be hearsay.

Wait, wait a minute. The statement is made by the witness, so it's hearsay. But the fact that it was made during a grand jury, which is a formal proceeding, makes it admissible. Because in a formal proceeding, the statement is admissible as a statement of fact. So the witness's statement is admissible, so the objection is denied.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Denied, because the statement was made during a formal legal proceeding and is therefore admissible.

Wait, but wait. I read that in a grand jury, the statement is admissible as a statement of fact. So the witness's statement is admissible, so the objection is denied.

The question revolves around whether the witness's statement introduced at the grand jury can be admitted as evidence. The key points to consider are the hearsay rules and the nature of the grand jury proceeding.

1. **Hearsay Rules**: A statement is hearsay unless it is made by a third party and not admissible without an exception. The statement was made by the witness, but it was also introduced during the grand jury, which is a formal legal proceeding. Under federal hearsay rules, statements made during a formal proceeding, such as a grand jury, are admissible as statements of fact unless they are under oath or fall under a recognized exception.

2. **Grand Jury Procedural Nature**: In many jurisdictions, statements made during a grand jury are considered admissible because they are made under a formal legal proceeding. This makes the witness's statement admissible as a hearsay exception (e.g., by a witness) or as a statement of fact.

3. **Options Analysis**: 
   - **Option A**: Correct. The statement was made during a formal proceeding, making it admissible as a statement of fact.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The questioning of the witness was not leading, and the statement was properly introduced.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement was admissible because it was made under a formal proceeding.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The witness's testimony could not prejudice the jury.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The statement was made under oath, so the defense's argument that it was not made under oath is flawed.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The attorney did object at the grand jury, which is relevant.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The attorney did not properly cross-examine the witness.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The statement was made under oath, so this is not a valid reason for denial.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The defendant was given an opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the grand jury.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The statement was admissible, so this is not a valid reason for denial.

The correct answer is **A**, as the witness's statement was admissible because it was made during a formal legal proceeding.

**Answer: A**
