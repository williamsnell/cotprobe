Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about publics as organizations exist by lending authority or assistance. The question is based on Esman's 1972 work. I'm not super familiar with Esman's theories, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Esman is known for his concept of publics, which are like institutions that provide basic social services. He talks about different types of publics. I think he categorizes them into a few groups like financial, regulatory, functional, and so on.

The question is asking which publics help an organization to exist by providing lending authority or assistance. So, I'm looking for a category that includes something like loans or support. 

Looking at the options, let me list them out:

A: Collaborative
B: Enabling
C: Strategic
D: Operational
E: Normative
F: Regulatory
G: Diffused
H: Functional
I: Financial
J: Administrative

Wait, I think I've heard that functional publics are ones that provide basic functions or services. Like, for example, a police force might be a functional public. They provide services that help the community.

Wait no, because functional publics are more about providing services that are essential for the functioning of society. Like, if it's a functional public, it's operational and necessary for the basic needs of society. So for instance, healthcare could be a functional public.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because sometimes people mix up the terms. Let me think again. Esman's publications I recall include works on publics and their functions. He discusses different types of publics, including financial, regulatory, functional, and operational.

Wait, functional publics are about providing the basic functions society needs, like healthcare, education, and social services. They don't provide the most basic services, like money, but instead, they provide the structure or the necessary services that are essential for the functioning of society. So, they're more about the institutions that support the basic needs, not the actual financial support.

So in that case, the correct answer would be H: Functional. Because functional publics help organizations to exist by providing the necessary services that support the basic functions of society.

Alternatively, another thought: maybe financial publics (I) are the ones that lend money or assist in financial matters. But the question is about lending authority or assistance, not necessarily the money itself. So perhaps financial publics are a subset of functional publics. So I'm a bit torn between H and I.

Wait, looking back, the question says "help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance." So if the organization is the one that needs help, maybe the publics are the ones providing that assistance. So if a public provides financial support, that would be an organization's need. So the public would be a financial public, which falls under I.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the definitions.

Functional publics (H) are institutions that provide the basic, necessary services that society needs, like healthcare, education, etc. They don't provide money; they provide the structure. They assist organizations by providing these services, supporting the existence of the organization.

Financial publics (I) are institutions that provide financial support, like loans or investments, helping organizations to exist by providing money.

So if the question is about providing financial assistance, then the answer would be I.

Alternatively, if it's about providing services that are necessary for the basic functioning of society, like healthcare, then H would be correct.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall Esman's original work. In his 1972 book, he discusses different publics. One of the key concepts is that publics are institutions that provide the basic functions of society. So functional publics are like the social services that are essential, such as healthcare, education, and the military. They don't provide money but provide the means to maintain basic needs.

So, the correct answer should be H: Functional.

Wait, but in other contexts, functional publics are those that contribute to the basic functioning of society, but do they provide financial support? Or do they provide the services that are necessary, which can sometimes involve financial aspects.

I'm a bit confused because sometimes functional and financial contexts overlap.

Wait, another approach: look for the term "financial publics." So if the question is about lending or assisting in financial matters, then financial publics (I) would be the answer.

But the question says "help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance." So the organization is the one that needs the lending. So the publics would be providing the necessary supporting services. So functional publics would be the ones that assist.

Alternatively, maybe functional publics are the ones that provide the structure, like the police, while financial publics provide the money.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the question again. The question is about which publics help an organization to exist. So the organization is the one that needs the public's help. The publics are the ones providing support or assistance.

If the public is a financial public, they provide financial assistance. If the public is a functional public, they provide the necessary services that support the existence of the organization.

Wait, but the options include both I and H. So, which one is correct?

I think the key is understanding what each term refers to. In Esman's work, functional publics are those that provide the basic functions needed for the functioning of society. For example, a public might be a healthcare provider, which is a functional public. They assist organizations by providing these services.

So, the answer should be H: Functional.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe the question refers to organizational finance. If an organization needs to exist, sometimes it needs financial support, so the public that provides financial assistance would be financial (I). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the term "public" refers to the institution providing the services, which is what the organization needs. So if an organization needs financial assistance, the public would be a financial public (I). 

Wait, but the question says "help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance." So the organization is the one that needs the public's help. The public is the one providing the assistance.

So if the organization needs financial assistance, the public is a financial public. So I think the answer is I.

But I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, I remember that functional publics are institutions that provide the basic functions of society, so they're a type of public. So the answer is H.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to think of other sources. I recall that in the book, Esman distinguishes between different types of publics. One of the key categories is "financial publics," which provide financial support, while others like "operational" and "strategic" focus on different aspects.

Wait, another approach: think about the options. The question is about what the organization needs. If the organization needs financial help, then the public would be a financial public (I). If they need services like healthcare, then it's a functional public (H).

The question is about lending or assistance, so it's more about providing financial support, not the necessary services. So the correct answer is I: Financial.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. I need to make a decision.

In the question, the organization needs "help" by lending, so the public is providing that help. So the public would be a financial public because they lend money. So answer I.

But I'm not certain because sometimes financial publics are also included in functional publics. Maybe the question is a bit ambiguous, but based on the options, I think the answer is I.
