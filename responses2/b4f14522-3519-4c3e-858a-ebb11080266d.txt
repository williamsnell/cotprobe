Question:

Restate the utility-maximizing rule in algebraic terms.

Options:

A: MU_A / Price_B = MU_B / Price_A = MU_C / Price_D = MU_D / Price_C
B: MU_A = MU_B = MU_C = MU_D
C: MU_A + MU_B = Price_A + Price_B
D: MU_A - MU_B = Price_A - Price_B
E: MU_A * MU_B * MU_C * MU_D = Price_A * Price_B * Price_C * Price_D
F: MU_A ^2 / Price_A = MU_B ^2 / Price_B
G: MU_A * Price_A = MU_B * Price_B = MU_C * Price_C = MU_D * Price_D
H: MU_A / MU_B = Price_A / Price_B
I: MU_A / Price_A ^2 = MU_B / Price_B ^2 = MU_C / Price_C ^2 = MU_D / Price_D ^2
J: (MU_A /Price_A) = (MU_B /Price_B) = (MU_C /Price_C) = (MU_D /Price_D)

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about the utility-maximizing rule. I remember that in microeconomics, when a consumer is trying to maximize their utility given their budget constraint, they choose the combination of goods where the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for all goods. 

The question is asking me to restate this rule in algebraic terms. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about what each of them represents.

Option A says MU_A / Price_B = MU_B / Price_A = MU_C / Price_D = MU_D / Price_C. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because in the rule, each good's marginal utility divided by its price is equal. So if there are multiple goods, each should have this ratio equal to the others. But in option A, the denominators are different goods' prices, which doesn't match. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B is stating that all marginal utilities are equal. That's not correct because the rule says the ratio of marginal utility to price should be equal, not the marginal utilities themselves being equal. So B is wrong.

Option C says the sum of marginal utilities equals the sum of prices. No, that's about total utility versus total cost, which is a different point. So C is incorrect.

Option D involves subtracting marginal utilities and prices. Not relevant; the rule is about ratios, not differences. So D is out.

Option E talks about products of marginal utilities and prices. That doesn't sound right. It's about ratios, not products. So E is incorrect.

Option F: MU_A squared divided by Price_A equals the same for MU_B and Price_B. That's a variation of the rule but not the standard form. The correct form doesn't square the utilities but considers their ratios. So F might be incorrect.

Option G: MU_A * Price_A = MU_B * Price_B = etc. Wait, no, that's the condition where the marginal utility times the price is equal for each good. Thatâ€™s similar to option G but not exactly the same as the rule. The correct rule is about the ratio of marginal utilities to prices being equal, not their product. So G seems to be a different condition, perhaps for utility maximization in terms of total spending. Wait, maybe it's about the condition when you have a fixed amount of money and you're choosing between goods. So if you have a budget constraint, the optimal condition is that the ratio of marginal utilities is equal to the ratio of prices.

Option H suggests MU_A over Price_A squared equals others. That seems like a different condition, perhaps related to utility maximization when the marginal utilities are proportional to the prices squared, but I don't think that's the utility-maximizing rule. So H is incorrect.

Option I: MU_A over Price_A squared equals for all goods. Again, this seems to involve a squared relationship, which doesn't fit the standard utility maximization condition. So I is incorrect.

Option J says (MU_A / Price_A) equals (MU_B / Price_B) and so on for all goods. That matches exactly what I remember about the utility-maximizing rule. So J is the correct one.

Wait, let me double-check. So the rule is that for each pair of goods, the ratio of marginal utility to the price is equal. That's MU_A / Price_A = MU_B / Price_B = MU_C / Price_C = etc. So J is stating that, so J is correct.

The correct answer is J, as it accurately restates the utility-maximizing rule by equating the marginal utility-to-price ratios for all goods.
