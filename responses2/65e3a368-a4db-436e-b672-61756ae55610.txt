Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the solubility of MgCl2 in various solutions. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, I'm a bit rusty on solubility rules, but I remember that solubility depends on the ions in the compound and the solute and solvent. MgCl2 is magnesium chloride, which dissociates into Mg²+ and Cl⁻ ions in water. So, when magnesium chloride dissolves, it breaks into these ions. 

The question is asking in which of these solutions it's the most soluble. The options are A to I, each with different aqueous solutions. I remember that solubility can be influenced by the ions present in the solution because of the solubility rules.

Let me recall the solubility rules. Most nitrates are soluble. So, any solution with NaNO3, KNO3, etc., would have Mg(NO3)2 be soluble. Oh wait, but wait, the options include Mg(NO3)2 as option I. Hmm, but wait, the question is about MgCl2, not Mg(NO3)2.

Wait, no. The options are A: AlCl3, B: CBr4, C: NaOH, D: HCl, E: LiOH, F: CH3COOH, G: NaCl, H: MgCl2, I: Mg(NO3)2.

Wait, the question is about MgCl2, so the options are all other solutions, except H. So, I'm looking for the most soluble in none of the solutions except where it's already present.

Wait, no, the question is, which of these solutions would MgCl2 be most soluble in. So, H is already MgCl2, but the question is about which solution it would be most soluble in. So, the correct answer would be the solution that dissolves MgCl2 the most.

Wait, but looking at the options, all except H are other compounds. So the question is, which of the other solutions (A to I, excluding H) would have MgCl2 dissolved the most.

Wait, no, wait. The question is about the solubility of MgCl2 in which solution. So, the question is, which of the options (A to I) would have the highest solubility for MgCl2.

So, let's go through each option:

A: AlCl3 (Aluminum chloride) in aqueous solution. I think AlCl3 is soluble in water. So, when MgCl2 is in AlCl3 solution, both ions are present. But wait, the solubility of MgCl2 in AlCl3 might not be high because when two soluble salts are mixed, they can form an ionic compound, but whether that's soluble depends on the solubility rules. I think MgCl2 is soluble, but AlCl3 is also soluble. So, together, maybe both ions would stay in solution, but I'm not sure about the solubility of MgCl2 itself in AlCl3. Alternatively, maybe AlCl3 isn't compatible. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe if you mix AlCl3 with MgCl2, it can form Al(OH)3, which is insoluble. But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, I think that when two soluble salts are mixed, a double displacement reaction occurs. The solubility of the products depends on their own rules. So, MgCl2 and AlCl3 would react to form AlCl3 and MgCl2. Wait, no, their reaction would be MgCl2 + AlCl3 → AlCl3 (aq) + MgCl2 (aq). No, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's a precipitation reaction. Let me think: AlCl3 is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates into Al³+ and Cl⁻. MgCl2 dissociates into Mg²+ and Cl⁻. So when they mix, the Cl⁻ ions combine with Al³+ to form AlCl3, which is insoluble. So the product is AlCl3, which precipitates out. So in such a case, the solution would have AlCl3 as the precipitate and MgCl2 would remain in solution as a spectator ion. Wait, but that's a bit conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the MgCl2 and AlCl3 would not react because both are soluble. Wait, no, that's not right. Because AlCl3 is soluble, MgCl2 is soluble, so their combination might not form an insoluble precipitate because both salts are soluble. So, in such a case, MgCl2 would remain dissolved. So AlCl3 wouldn't precipitate. So, MgCl2 would be soluble in AlCl3 solution. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the solubility of MgCl2 in AlCl3. Alternatively, maybe AlCl3 is a stronger acid than MgCl2, but I don't think that affects solubility here.

Wait, but the question is about the solubility of MgCl2 in each solution. So, perhaps the solubility of MgCl2 in each of these options.

Wait, another point: the presence of anions that would form a precipitate with Mg²+ can lower the solubility. For example, if the solution contains a sulfate ion (SO4^2-), MgSO4 would precipitate because sulfate is insoluble. Similarly, if the solution has carbonate (CO3^2-), MgCO3 is insoluble. But AlCl3 is an anion with Cl^- which is a weaker base than sulfate or carbonate, so maybe AlCl3 doesn't form a precipitate with MgCl2. Wait, but in AlCl3, the Cl^- ions are present. So in AlCl3 solution, which is a strong electrolyte, MgCl2 would dissociate into Mg²+ and Cl^-.

So when AlCl3 is in the presence of MgCl2, the Cl^- would combine with Al³+ to form AlCl3, which is insoluble. Wait, but wait: AlCl3 is a strong electrolyte and is itself soluble. If you have AlCl3 and MgCl2 in the same solution, the Cl^- from AlCl3 would react with Mg²+ to form AlCl3, which is a precipitate. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because AlCl3 is a strong electrolyte, when you have AlCl3 and MgCl2 in the same solution, the Mg²+ and Cl^- would combine with Al³+ to form AlCl3, which is a precipitate. So the solution would have AlCl3 precipitate and MgCl2 dissolved. So in that case, the MgCl2 would have a low solubility, but wait, that's not the case because both salts are soluble. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the solubility of MgCl2 in each solution. MgCl2 is a soluble salt. So, in which solution is MgCl2 more soluble? Wait, the question is asking which of the options is the most soluble, but the options are all other solutions except H, which is MgCl2(aq).

Wait, no, the options are aqueous solutions, and the question is about the solubility of MgCl2 in each. So, for example, in option I, Mg(NO3)2 is a soluble salt, so perhaps that's more soluble than others. Because if you have MgCl2 in a solution with nitrate ions, perhaps the nitrate counterions don't affect the solubility as much. Or perhaps the solubility of MgCl2 is higher in a solution without other ions that would compete.

Wait, I think that a solution with nitrate ions (NO3^-) would not affect the solubility of MgCl2. Because in the solubility rules, nitrate is always soluble, regardless of other ions. So, MgCl2 would be soluble in any solution that includes nitrate ions. Because the nitrate doesn't react with Mg²+ to form a precipitate. The precipitate would form if you have another anion that reacts with Mg²+ and is insoluble. For example, if a solution has sulfate (SO4^2-), then MgSO4 would precipitate. Similarly, carbonate (CO3^2-) would form MgCO3 precipitate.

So, looking at the options, which of them contain nitrate ions? Let's check each option:

Looking at the options:

A: AlCl3: No NO3^-.

B: CBr4: No NO3^-.

C: NaOH: No NO3^-.

D: HCl: No NO3^-.

E: LiOH: No NO3^-.

F: CH3COOH: No NO3^-.

G: NaCl: No NO3^-.

H: MgCl2: itself, but this is the solution for which we are finding solubility.

I: Mg(NO3)2: yes, it has nitrate ions.

So, in the case of MgCl2 in solution I (Mg(NO3)2), since nitrate is present, the solubility of MgCl2 is high because nitrate doesn't form a precipitate. Wait, but that's actually not the case. Because in solution I, MgCl2 is in the form of Mg(NO3)2, which is soluble. So, if the solution contains nitrate, the solution is more likely to be more soluble for MgCl2. Because the nitrate ions don't interfere with the dissolution of MgCl2.

So, in this case, the solubility of MgCl2 in solution I would be higher than in any other solution because it's already in the form of a nitrate salt. So, the correct answer would be I, Mg(NO3)2(aq). Because MgCl2 is soluble in Mg(NO3)2, where nitrate is the counterion.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not correct. Because MgCl2 is more soluble in a solution that includes nitrate ions because the nitrate is the spectator ion. So, MgCl2 is more soluble in a solution that includes nitrate ions than in a solution without them. For instance, if you have MgCl2 in a solution with NaNO3, the solubility of MgCl2 should increase because the nitrate is present. So, the more nitrate ions you have, the higher the solubility of MgCl2.

So, looking back at the options, in option I, the solution is Mg(NO3)2. That's a nitrate solution. So, if you have a solution where the anions are nitrate, the solubility of MgCl2 would be higher.

Alternatively, the solubility of MgCl2 in different solutions:

- Pure water: MgCl2 is soluble.

- AlCl3 solution: MgCl2 is soluble, but if AlCl3 is present, perhaps some precipitation occurs, but the solubility isn't the highest.

Wait, but in any case, the highest solubility would be in the presence of nitrate ions, because as I thought, the nitrate doesn't affect the solubility of MgCl2. So, the maximum solubility would be in solution I, Mg(NO3)2. Because when you have nitrate ions, the solution is more conducive to MgCl2 dissolving since nitrate doesn't form a precipitate with Mg²+.

So, the correct answer is I: Mg(NO3)2(aq). Because MgCl2 is soluble in this solution, and the presence of nitrate ions doesn't interfere with that solubility.

To determine in which aqueous solution magnesium chloride (MgCl₂) is most soluble, we analyze the solubility rules and the given options. Magnesium chloride, as a soluble salt, dissociates into Mg²⁺ and Cl⁻ ions in solution. The presence of other ions can influence the solubility of MgCl₂:

- **AlCl₃ (A):** AlCl₃ is soluble in water, but the Cl⁻ ions would combine with Al³⁺ to form AlCl₃, a precipitate. Thus, MgCl₂ would have low solubility in this solution.
- **CBr₄ (B):** CBr₄ is not soluble in water, and there are no anions to react with Mg²⁺, so MgCl₂ would be highly soluble.
- **NaOH (C):** NaOH is a strong base, but the Cl⁻ ions would combine with Na⁺ to form NaCl, a soluble salt. MgCl₂ would remain mostly soluble, but not as much as in solution I.
- **HCl (D):** HCl is a strong acid, but the Cl⁻ ions would combine with Mg²⁺ to form MgCl₂, which is already present. Thus, MgCl₂ would remain mostly soluble, but not as much as in solution I.
- **LiOH (E):** LiOH is a strong base, but the Cl⁻ ions would combine with Li⁺ to form LiCl, a soluble salt. MgCl₂ would remain mostly soluble, but not as much as in solution I.
- **CH₃COOH (F):** CH₃COOH is an acid, but the Cl⁻ ions would combine with Mg²⁺ to form MgCl₂, which is already present. Thus, MgCl₂ would remain mostly soluble, but not as much as in solution I.
- **NaCl (G):** NaCl is highly soluble in water, but there are no anions to react with Mg²⁺, so MgCl₂ would be highly soluble.
- **MgCl₂ (H):** This is the solution in which MgCl₂ already exists and is fully soluble.
- **Mg(NO₃)₂ (I):** Mg(NO₃)₂ is a nitrate salt, and nitrate ions (NO₃⁻) are always soluble. Therefore, MgCl₂ remains mostly soluble in this solution because the nitrate ions do not interfere with the solubility of MgCl₂. The presence of nitrate ions enhances solubility by serving as a spectator ion.

Among the options, the highest solubility of MgCl₂ occurs in solution I (Mg(NO₃)₂(aq)) due to the presence of nitrate ions, which do not affect the solubility of MgCl₂.
