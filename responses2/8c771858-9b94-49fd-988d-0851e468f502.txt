Okay, so I've got this problem here about functions and their properties. Let's see, I need to figure out whether statements 1 and 2 are true or not. The question gives me two statements about functions f and g, which are from set A to B and B to A respectively. The condition is that for every a in A, applying g after f gives me a. So, for all a, g(f(a)) = a. 

Statement 1 says that g must be injective. Statement 2 says g must be surjective. I have to determine if each of these is necessarily true, or if there's a possibility that they're not.

Let me think about injective and surjective functions. Injective means that each element in A maps to a unique element in B—no two different a's map to the same f(a). Surjective means that every element in B is hit by some element in A. So, for g: B→A, g being injective means that if g(b1) = g(b2), then b1 must equal b2. Surjective means that for every a in A, there exists some b in B such that g(b) = a.

Given that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, what does that tell me about g's properties? Let me break it down.

First, for Statement 1: Is g necessarily injective? Suppose that g is not injective. That would mean there exist two distinct elements b1 and b2 in B such that g(b1) = g(b2). Now, since f is a function from A to B, let's pick an a such that f(a) is one of these b's. Let's say f(a) = b1. Then g(f(a)) = g(b1) = b2. Similarly, if f(a') = b2 for some a' in A, then g(f(a')) = g(b2) = b2. So, g(a) = g(a') = b2. But wait, that would mean that g is not injective because g sends both a and a' to the same value. But wait, hold on—since g is a function from B to A, and g(b1)=g(b2)=b2, but what about other elements in B? Are there other elements that g might map to?

Wait, no, because g is defined as a function from B to A. So, if g sends both b1 and b2 to the same element in A (which is b2), then g is not injective because b1 and b2 are distinct elements in B, but they are mapped to the same element in A. But wait, the condition given is only that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. So, for all a, g(f(a)) = a. That doesn't necessarily mean that g is injective in general, but maybe in this specific case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that g is not injective. Then, there exist b1 and b2 in B (with b1 ≠ b2) such that g(b1) = g(b2) = c for some c in A. Now, since g(f(a)) = a for all a, for a particular a, we have g(f(a)) = a. So, suppose f(a) = b1. Then g(b1) = a. But g(b1) is also equal to c. So, a must equal c. Similarly, for a different a', f(a') = b1, then g(f(a')) = a' = c. That would imply that a and a' must both be equal to c. But a and a' are in A, and c is an element in A. So, this would mean that only one a (specifically, a = c) would map through f to b1, which is allowed since f is a function. But if there are multiple a's mapping to the same c, then each of those a's would require that g(b1) = c, but b1 is the same across all such a's. 

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think: If g is not injective, then there are two distinct elements in B, say b1 and b2, which map to the same element in A, say c. Now, suppose that for some a and a' in A, f(a) = b1 and f(a') = b2. Then, g(f(a)) = g(b1) = c, and g(f(a')) = g(b2) = c. But according to the condition g(f(a)) = a, that would mean c = a and c = a'. So, a must equal a', which would mean that f(a) = b1 and f(a') = b2 only if a = a'. But that's only possible if b1 and b2 are equal, which contradicts the assumption that b1 ≠ b2. So, this suggests that our initial assumption that g is not injective leads to a contradiction, meaning g must indeed be injective. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me try again. Suppose g is not injective; then there exists b1 ≠ b2 with g(b1)=g(b2)=c. Now, for each such b, there must exist at least one a in A such that f(a) = b1 or f(a) = b2. Let's say for b1, there is an a where f(a) = b1, and similarly for b2, an a' where f(a') = b2. Then, g(f(a)) = g(b1) = c, which must equal a, so a = c. Similarly, g(f(a')) = g(b2) = c, which must equal a', so a' = c. Therefore, a = a' = c. So, f(c) = b1 and f(c) = b2 implies that b1 = b2. But we assumed b1 ≠ b2, so this is impossible. Therefore, our assumption that g is not injective leads to a contradiction. So, g must be injective. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

Now for Statement 2: Is g necessarily surjective? Let's think. A function g: B→A is surjective if every element in A is the image of some element in B. So, for every a in A, there exists some b in B such that g(b) = a.

Given that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, that tells us that for each a, f(a) is in the preimage of a under g. Because g(f(a)) = a, that means f(a) must be an element in g^{-1}(a). So, the image of f is a subset of the union of the preimages of each a in A under g. But does this imply that g is surjective?

Let me consider an element a in A. Since g is a function from B to A, to be surjective, every a must be the image of some element in B. But the condition only tells us that for each a, there's at least one element in B (namely f(a)) such that g(f(a)) = a. So, that's exactly the condition for surjectivity. So, for each a in A, there exists b = f(a) in B such that g(b) = a. Therefore, g must be surjective. 

Wait, wait. Is that correct? Because for surjective, every a in A must have a preimage under g. So, yes, because for each a in A, f(a) is in B and g(f(a)) = a, so g is surjective. So, Statement 2 is true.

Therefore, both statements are true. So, looking at the options, the answer should be F: True, True.

Wait, but in the options, option F is "True, True." Let me double-check. 

Wait, earlier, I thought that Statement 1 is true, because assuming g is not injective leads to a contradiction. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in that reasoning. Let me think again. Suppose g is not injective, then there are b1 ≠ b2 with g(b1)=g(b2)=c. Then, for each of these, there must be an a and a' in A such that f(a)=b1 and f(a')=b2. Then, g(f(a))=c = a, and g(f(a'))=c = a'. Thus, a = a' = c. So, f(c)=b1 and f(c)=b2, which implies that b1 = b2, which contradicts the assumption. So, this can't happen. Therefore, our initial assumption is wrong, so g must be injective. So, Statement 1 is true.

For Statement 2: Since for every a in A, there exists b = f(a) in B such that g(b) = a, so every a in A has a preimage under g, meaning g is surjective. So, Statement 2 is true.

So, the answer is F: True, True.

The reasoning shows that both statements are true. 

**Answer:** F: True, True.
