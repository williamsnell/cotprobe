Question:

A construction contractor brought a breach of contract claim in federal court against a homeowner who had hired the contractor to build an apartment over an existing garage. The action turned on the scope of the work covered by the contract. The contractor and the homeowner were the only witnesses at the bench trial, and they strongly disagreed about the scope of the work. At the end of the trial, the judge stated findings of fact on the record but never issued a written opinion. Neither party objected to the findings. The judge found in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor appealed. Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?

Options:

A: No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.
B: Yes, because the contractor and homeowner had different views on the scope of the work.
C: Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.
D: No, because the judge's findings of fact were stated on the record.
E: Yes, because the homeowner was found in favor.
F: No, because the contractor brought the claim in federal court.
G: Yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial.
H: No, because the contractor didn't provide sufficient evidence to support the claim.
I: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn the findings.
J: No, because the contractor failed to object to the findings when the judge stated them in open court.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the appellate court is likely to overturn the findings of fact in this case. Let me read through the facts again to make sure I understand all the details.

The scenario is a construction contractor who sued a homeowner who hired them to build an apartment over an existing garage. The issue was the scope of the work covered by the contract. Both the contractor and the homeowner were at the bench trial, and their opinions about the work's scope were very different. The judge found the homeowner's side, and then the contractor is appealing.

Now, the question is whether the appellate court is likely to overturn the findings of fact. The options are A to J, each with a different reason.

I remember that the appellate court's role is to review the decisions made by the lower court. But the key point is about the findings of fact. The findings of fact are presented to the lower court, and the lower court doesn't necessarily have to make a written decision. But the appellate court must follow the findings.

Wait, but the options in the question are about whether the appellate court will overturn the findings. So, I need to think about the rules regarding how the lower court presents findings.

In many jurisdictions, the lower court can make findings of fact without a written opinion. The appellate court can then review those findings. But sometimes, even if the findings are made publicly, the appellate court might not overturn them if they're in conflict with the evidence presented or if the findings themselves are incorrect.

Wait, but the question says the judge found in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor is appealing. The options are whether the appellate court will overturn the findings. So, if the findings were made public, and they were correct, then the appellate court would probably uphold them. But if the findings were incorrect, the appellate court might reverse them.

Wait, but the findings were made public, but the lower court didn't issue a written opinion. So, the judge might have made the findings public without a written opinion, perhaps because it's not always required. So, in this case, the findings were made in court. So the appellate court can review them.

But let's look at the options. Option A says no because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity. Hmm. The appellate court does have the opportunity, but does it require it? Or does it just review the findings regardless of the judge's record?

Option B: Yes, because the contractor and homeowner had different views on the scope. But the reason for different views may not matter for the findings; the findings are based on the facts presented, not the opinions of the parties.

Option C: Yes because the judge must set forth findings in a written opinion or memorandum. But the judge didn't issue a written opinion; it was made public. So, maybe that's not the reason.

Option D: No because the judge's findings were stated on the record. But the findings were made public, so the record would have been the findings. So that's not right.

Option E: No because the contractor didn't provide sufficient evidence. But the question is about the findings, not the evidence presented. The question is about the findings being overturned, not about the evidence.

Option F: No because the contractor didn't object. But again, the findings are based on the evidence and the facts, not the parties' objections.

Option G: Yes because there were disputed issues of fact at trial. But that's about the trial's outcome, not the findings.

Option H: No because the contractor didn't provide sufficient evidence. Again, unrelated to the findings.

Option I: Yes because the appellate court has the power to overturn the findings. That sounds correct because the appellate court can review the findings regardless of the parties' objections, as long as the findings were made public.

Option J: No because the contractor failed to object to the findings. So the findings were made, and the parties didn't object, so the appellate court would overturn them because the findings were incorrect or in conflict with the evidence.

Wait, but the question is whether the findings were stated on the record, so the findings were presented. The appellate court can review them regardless, but if the findings were incorrect, they would be overturned. But the question is about the findings being "stated on the record." So, if the judge made the findings on the record (which is what happened), the appellate court can review them.

Wait, but the options:

A: No because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity. So, the appellate court doesn't have to give due regard, it's just that it can review the findings regardless of the trial's record.

B: Because the parties had differing views. No, because that's about the parties' opinions, not the findings.

C: Because the judge must set forth findings in a written opinion. But the judge didn't issue a written opinion, but made the findings public. So, that's a misunderstanding.

D: No because the findings were on the record. But that's not the reason. The findings were made public, so the record would include them.

E: No because the contractor didn't provide sufficient evidence. But the question is about findings, not the evidence.

I think the key point is whether the findings were correctly made. The question is whether the findings were stated on the record. The options:

Option D says the findings were on the record, which is correct. So, the appellate court must review the findings, regardless of the parties' objections.

Wait, but the question is about whether they are likely to overturn the findings. So, if the findings were made public, and correct, then the appellate court would uphold them. But if they were incorrect, the court would reverse.

But the options are about why they are likely to overturn. Option I says the appellate court has the power to overturn. That's correct, but is the question about the reason why?

Wait, the options are trying to state the reason why the findings are likely to be overturned. So, the question is whether the findings were stated on the record, and the reason is the appellate court's power to overturn.

Wait, the question is phrased as: "Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?" The answer options are about the reason the findings are likely to be overturned.

So, looking at each option:

Option A: No because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity. So, the appellate court can review the findings regardless of the trial's record.

But the question is whether the findings are likely to be overturned. So, if the findings were correct, the appellate court would overturn. But the question is about the reason the findings are likely to be overturned. So, if the findings are correct, the appellate court would reverse.

But the options don't directly answer the reason. So, the options are not about the reason, but about the outcome.

Wait, the options are asking whether the appellate court is likely to overturn the findings. So, the answer depends on whether the findings were correct. The question is, did the judge's findings of fact hold, or were they incorrect, leading the appellate court to reverse them.

But the question is about whether the findings (the court's findings) are likely to be overturned.

Wait, the options are phrased as "Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?" The options are about the reason.

Option I: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn the findings.

But I think the correct reasoning is that the appellate court can review the findings regardless of the parties' objections. So, the answer is I: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn.

But wait, the question is about whether the findings are likely to be overturned, not whether the court is to overturn them.

Wait, the options are about the reason the findings are likely to be overturned. So, if the findings were correct, the appellate court would reverse. So the answer is whether the findings were correct.

But the question is about whether the findings are likely to be overturned, not whether the court would overturn them.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the findings being correct and the court's decision. The question is, "Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings." So, if the findings were correct, then yes. But the options are about the reason.

Wait, the options are like, "Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn." So, the reason is that the appellate court can overturn. The actual outcome depends on whether the findings are correct.

But the question isn't about the correctness of the findings, but whether the findings are likely to be overturned. So, if the judge's findings were correct, the appellate court would reverse. But if they were incorrect, the court would reverse.

But the options don't state that; they are about the reason the findings are likely to be overturned.

So, the answer is that the appellate court can overturn the findings, regardless of the parties' objections. So, the answer is option I: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn the findings.

But wait, the options are about whether the findings are likely to be overturned. So, the correct answer is I, because the appellate court can overturn. But I'm not sure if the correct reasoning is that the appellate court can, regardless of the parties' objections, so the answer is I.

So, the options are:

I: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn the findings.

So, the answer would be I.
</think>

The appellate court has the power to overturn the findings of fact as they are presented by the lower court. The findings were made public and were not subject to a written opinion, but the appellate court retains the authority to review them. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn the findings.
