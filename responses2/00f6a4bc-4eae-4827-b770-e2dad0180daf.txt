Okay, so I have this differential equation problem to solve using Euler's method. Let me think through it step by step. The equation is dy/dx = 3x + 4y. The initial condition is y(0) = 0, and the step size h is 0.25. I need to find y(1). 

Euler's method is a numerical way to approximate solutions to differential equations. The formula I remember is y_{n+1} = y_n + h * f(x_n, y_n), where f is the derivative function, right? So in this case, f(x,y) is 3x +4y.

Starting point is x0=0, y0=0. We need to take steps until x reaches 1, which is four steps (since each step is 0.25). Let me list out each step.

Step 1: From x=0 to x=0.25.
f(x0,y0)=3*(0) +4*(0)=0. So y1 = y0 + h*0 =0 +0.25*0=0.

So after first step, x=0.25, y=0.

Step 2: From x=0.25 to x=0.5.
Compute f at x=0.25, y=0: 3*0.25 +4*0 =0.75. Multiply by h=0.25: 0.75 *0.25 = 0.1875. So y2 = 0 + 0.1875 = 0.1875.

x=0.5, y=0.1875.

Step3: x=0.5 to x=0.75.
f(x3)=3*(0.5) +4*(0.1875) =1.5 + 0.75 =2.25. Multiply by h=0.25: 2.25*0.25=0.5625. y3=0.1875 +0.5625=0.75.

x=0.75, y=0.75.

Step4: x=0.75 to x=1.0.
Compute f(x4)=3*(0.75) +4*(0.75) =2.25 +3=5.25. Multiply by h=0.25: 5.25 *0.25 =1.3125. So y4=0.75 +1.3125=2.0625.

So y(1)=2.0625.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.0625. So the answer should be I.

To solve the differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x + 4y\) using Euler's method with step size \(h = 0.25\), we start at \(x = 0\), \(y(0) = 0\). The function \(f(x, y) = 3x + 4y\) is evaluated at each step, and \(y\) is updated as \(y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n)\). After four steps to reach \(x = 1\), the value of \(y(1)\) is calculated as follows:

1. Step 1: \(x_1 = 0.25\), \(y_1 = 0\).
2. Step 2: \(x_2 = 0.5\), \(y_2 = 0.1875\).
3. Step 3: \(x_3 = 0.75\), \(y_3 = 0.75\).
4. Step 4: \(x_4 = 1.0\), \(y_4 = 2.0625\).

Thus, \(y(1) = 2.0625\), which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I: 2.0625
