Okay, so I've got this DNA question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about which molecule has the fewest nucleotides. The options are A to J, each describing different things related to DNA processing.

Hmm, I remember that DNA is made up of four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. Each has a complementary strand. When DNA is transcribed into RNA, each DNA nucleotide becomes one RNA nucleotide. So, the number of nucleotides in RNA is the same as in DNA. So like, if DNA has a certain number of nucleotides, RNA would have the same.

Wait, but wait, in the options, some might be processed or have modifications. Like, option A says the tRNA transcript from the original DNA. Wait, tRNA is involved in translation, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Oh wait, no, tRNA is made from RNA, so the RNA would have the same number of nucleotides as DNA. So in that case, the tRNA would have the same as the DNA.

Looking at option B: a single strand after substitution. Substitution would change one nucleotide, so the entire strand would have one less nucleotide. So B would have one less than the original DNA.

Option C is the processed mRNA. That's the mRNA that's been translated, so it's made from the DNA, but with some modifications. Wait, but mRNA is made from DNA, so its nucleotides are the same as the DNA. So if the DNA has, say, 20 nt, mRNA would be 20 as well.

Option D: primary RNA transcript after splicing. Splicing removes introns, so the mRNA would have the same number of nucleotides as the pre-spliced RNA, which is same as DNA. So D would have the same as the DNA.

Option E: single DNA strand after duplication. Duplication would mean each strand is copied, but a single strand would have the same number as before. So E has same as original DNA.

Option F: primary RNA before splicing. Before splicing, the RNA would have one more nucleotide than the mRNA? Wait, no. The primary RNA (before splicing) is the same as the mRNA, which has the same number of nucleotides as DNA. So F would have same as DNA.

Option G: single DNA strand after deletion. Deletion would reduce the number of nucleotides. So G's strand has fewer.

Option H: complementary DNA. Wait, complementary DNA is a separate molecule. It's made from the original DNA. So the number of nucleotides would be same as the original DNA. So H is the same as the original DNA.

Option I: cDNA made from the original DNA. cDNA is the complementary DNA strand. So each DNA nucleotide becomes a cDNA. So same number of nucleotides as DNA. So I would have same as DNA.

Option J: single DNA strand after point mutation. Point mutations change one base, so same number as original DNA.

Wait, the question is which has the fewest. So, let's see:

The original DNA has N nt.

Options:

A: tRNA transcript — same as DNA: N.

B: substitution → N-1.

C: mRNA — same as DNA: N.

D: spliced mRNA → same as mRNA: N.

E: duplication → same as original: N.

F: before splicing → same as mRNA: N.

G: deletion → N-1.

H: complementary DNA → same as original: N.

I: cDNA → same as mRNA: N.

J: point mutation → same as original: N.

So the options that have one less are B and G. Which is fewer? Both have N-1.

Wait, but the options are asking for the fewest. So which is the smallest possible? Both would have N-1 nucleotides.

But looking at the options, the question is which one has the fewest. So between B and G, both have N-1.

Wait, but the question is about the fewest. So which one is the least, meaning the smallest. So which of the options is a single strand that's N-1.

So if B is substitution (so one less) and G is deletion (also one less), which is the correct answer?

Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: tRNA transcript — same as DNA.

B: substitution → N-1.

C: mRNA → same as DNA.

D: spliced mRNA → same as DNA.

E: duplication → same as DNA.

F: before splicing → same as mRNA.

G: deletion → N-1.

H: complementary DNA → same as original.

I: cDNA → same as mRNA.

J: point mutation → same as original.

So the question is, which has the fewest. Both B and G have N-1, which is the same. So, the fewest number would be the smallest possible. So both B and G would have N-1. But the options don't have multiple correct answers. Wait, no, each option is a different scenario. So the question is which option is the fewest.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the fewest number of nucleotides in each option.

Original DNA has N nt.

A: tRNA transcript: same as DNA, so N.

B: substitution → N-1.

C: mRNA → N.

D: spliced mRNA → N.

E: duplication → N.

F: before splicing → N.

G: deletion → N-1.

H: complementary DNA → N.

I: cDNA → N.

J: mutation → N.

So options B and G have N-1, which is one less than the original. So which of these is the fewest? Both B and G have same, but the question is which of the given options (A-J) has the fewest.

Wait, but the question is asking which has the fewest. So in the given options, B and G are the ones with N-1. So the correct answers are B and G. But the options can't have two correct answers. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the same DNA, but different processes. Oh wait, the question says, which of the following molecules contains the fewest number of nucleotides. So the fewest possible. So the minimal number is N-1, so the options B and G are the ones with N-1, so both are correct.

But looking at the options, all the options are separate; the question is which of these is the correct answer. So perhaps the options are about which is the fewest, so the answer would be either B or G. Wait, but the question is to choose one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. What's the correct answer? Let's see.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. 

Wait, the question is which of the following has the fewest number of nucleotides.

So, in each option:

A: tRNA transcript from original DNA. Since tRNA is made from RNA, same as DNA. So same as the original, N.

B: substitution mutation → so the DNA has one nucleotide changed. So the single strand after substitution has N-1.

C: mRNA made from DNA. So same as DNA, N.

D: spliced mRNA → same as mRNA, N.

E: DNA after duplication. So same as original, N.

F: primary RNA before splicing → same as mRNA, N.

G: deletion mutation → single strand has N-1.

H: complementary DNA → N.

I: cDNA → same as mRNA, N.

J: point mutation → same as original, N.

So both B and G have N-1, which is the fewest possible. But the options are all separate, so the question must have a unique correct answer.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I'm missing something. Are any of these options possible? Or perhaps the question is that the options are presented, and you have to choose which is the fewest.

Wait, the options are A to J, each is a different scenario. So the correct answer would be both B and G. But wait, looking at the options, the user's question says "the fewest number of nucleotides". So the minimal is N-1. So both B and G are correct.

But the question is, which of the options is the correct answer, so perhaps the options only have one correct answer. Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, each a different scenario. So perhaps the correct answer is one of them, but the options are designed such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the substitution. Substitution changes one base, but the single strand after substitution would have N-1 nucleotides.

Wait, but wait: substitution is a point mutation, which changes one base. So if a DNA strand has N bases, substitution would change one to another. Thus, the single strand becomes N-1.

So option B is substitution, thus N-1.

Option G is deletion: deletion of one base, so N-1.

So both have N-1. So both are correct.

Wait, but the options are multiple-choice, and the user is to choose one. So perhaps I'm missing something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of nucleotides in the RNA. Let me think again.

Wait, RNA is made from DNA, so the number of nucleotides in RNA is same as DNA. So RNA would have N nucleotides.

Wait, but the options include single strands. For example, option B is a single strand after substitution, so that's N-1.

Wait, but RNA doesn't have the same as DNA, does it? No, RNA is made from DNA, but each DNA base is a base in RNA.

Wait, no: DNA is made of nucleotides, RNA is made of nucleotides as well. So the number of nucleotides in RNA equals DNA. So a single DNA strand after substitution, when made into RNA, would have same number of nucleotides as the original DNA strand.

Wait, but the options are about single strands of the original DNA (like option B: a single DNA strand after substitution). So when you make RNA from it, it's the same length as the original DNA strand. So RNA would have same N, not N-1.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

The original DNA has N nucleotides. DNA is made of two strands, each with N.

Option B: substitution mutation on the original DNA. So the single strand after substitution has N-1 nucleotides. Then, the RNA made from this would have N-1 nucleotides as well, same as the DNA.

So in this case, the RNA would have N-1, same as the single DNA strand.

Wait, but the question is about the number of nucleotides in the single DNA strand after mutation. So, if it's a substitution, the single strand would have N-1 nucleotides. So option B is the single DNA strand after substitution, which has N-1.

Wait, but the question is which of these molecules has the fewest nucleotides. So, the single DNA strand after substitution has N-1. The RNA (like option A, C, D, E, I, J) have the same N as the original DNA.

So, the RNA has N nucleotides, same as the DNA. So the single DNA strand after substitution (option B) has N-1, which is fewer than RNA.

So looking at the options, the fewest is option B (nucleotides in DNA strand after substitution: N-1) and option G (single DNA strand after deletion: N-1). So both have the same number of nucleotides. So which of these is correct?

Wait, but the options are in the choices, so perhaps the correct answer is option B or G, but perhaps only one is correct. Wait, perhaps I'm missing that in the question, the options are all about the same original DNA, so the fewest is the single DNA strand after mutation, because that's a change in the DNA structure, leading to less nucleotides.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution mutation leads to a different DNA structure, but the single strand would just have N-1 instead of N.

Wait, but the question is about the number of nucleotides in each scenario, not the number in the DNA.

So, the single DNA strand after substitution (option B) would be N-1. The mRNA would be N, same as DNA. So the RNA has more nucleotides.

So, the fewest would be option B, because it's N-1. Option G would be N-1 as well.

Wait, but the options are A-J, each a different scenario. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the question is which of the following contains the fewest number of nucleotides. So in the choices, option B is the substitution in the DNA, which becomes N-1 in RNA.

Wait, no, the RNA in option A is the tRNA transcript, which is same as DNA, so N.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The options given:

Option B: a single DNA strand after substitution → has N-1 nt.

Option G: a single DNA strand after deletion → has N-1 nt.

So both have N-1. But which is the correct answer?

Wait, the question says, "the fewest number of nucleotides." So, between B and G, which is the correct answer?

Wait, the options are all separate, so the selection is one. So perhaps the question is about the RNA or mRNA, but the options include single DNA strands.

Wait, the question is about nucleotides in the molecules. So, for RNA, the mRNA is of same N as DNA. But the tRNA is of same N.

Wait, but the question is about the fewest. So option B and G have N-1.

But perhaps the substitution leads to a single strand with N-1, which is fewer than the rest.

Wait, but all the other options (except B and G) have same N as the original DNA.

So, the minimal is option B and G.

But how can you choose one? The options may have only one correct because of the way the options are phrased.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: tRNA transcript from original DNA. → same as DNA, N.

B: substitution → N-1.

C: mRNA → same as DNA, N.

D: spliced mRNA → same as DNA, N.

E: DNA after duplication → N.

F: before splicing → N.

G: deletion → N-1.

H: complementary DNA → N.

I: cDNA → same as mRNA, N.

J: point mutation → same as original DNA, N.

So, two options (B and G) have N-1.

But the options are a list from A to J, each a different scenario. So perhaps the correct answer is B and G.

Wait, but the question is "which of the following molecules contains the fewest number of nucleotides?" So the answer is the one with N-1.

So the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

So the correct answers are B and G. But the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, but the options are presented as a list, so perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the question. Let me read it again.

Question: Which of the following has the fewest number of nucleotides?

Options are A to J, each describes a scenario.

So, the question is, which one is the fewest.

So, for the single DNA strand after substitution (B): N-1.

For the single DNA strand after deletion (G): N-1.

Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's think about the structure of the DNA and RNA.

DNA has a double helix structure, but the question is about the single strand, so substitution changes one base. So, substitution in DNA would change the single strand (so N-1).

In RNA, the single strand would have N nucleotides because RNA is made from DNA. So, the RNA would have N.

So, the single DNA strand after substitution (B) has N-1, which is the fewest.

Then, option G is a single DNA strand after deletion, which also has N-1.

Wait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is B or G.

But the question is, which of the following has the fewest. So the options are all separate scenarios, so perhaps the correct answer is B and G, but in the context of the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the substitution leads to a single strand with N-1, which is fewer than the rest, so option B is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both B and G have N-1. Maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substitution in DNA would lead to a single strand with N-1.

In RNA, the same single DNA strand has N nucleotides.

So, RNA would have more nucleotides than the original DNA.

So, the RNA has N, which is same as the DNA.

Wait, but the question is asking about the number in the molecule, not the DNA.

So, the single DNA strand after substitution (B) is N-1 nucleotides.

The RNA (A, C, D, E, I, J): same as the DNA. So N.

Thus, the fewest is B and G.

But in the options, I have to choose one of them, but the question gives multiple choices. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about the fewest number in the molecules.

The only way to have the minimal number is in a scenario where you have fewer nucleotides than the original DNA.

RNA has same as DNA, so not the case.

mRNA after splicing (D) same as DNA.

The single DNA strand after substitution (B) has N-1.

Same as single DNA strand after deletion (G): N-1.

So, both B and G have N-1.

But in the multiple-choice options, perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the options again.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

The question is: which of the following has the fewest number of nucleotides?

Available options:

A: tRNA from DNA → same as DNA (N).

B: DNA after substitution → N-1.

C: mRNA → same as DNA (N).

D: spliced mRNA → same as DNA (N).

E: DNA after duplication → same as DNA (N).

F: primary RNA before splicing → same as mRNA (N).

G: DNA after deletion → N-1.

H: complementary DNA → same as original (N).

I: cDNA → same as mRNA (N).

J: point mutation → same as original (N).

So, the only options with N-1 are B and G.

But the question is, which of the following contains the fewest number of nucleotides.

So, the correct answer would be either B or G.

Wait, but the options are all separate, so the correct answer is either B or G. So the question must have a unique correct answer, so perhaps I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution changes only one base, but the single DNA strand has N-1 nucleotides, which is fewer than the RNA, mRNA, etc.

So, the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the options are given as a list, so perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the mRNA, which has same number as DNA. So, substitution in DNA would have fewer.

Wait, but the question is about the single DNA strand in each option.

So, the single DNA strand after substitution (B) has N-1.

The single DNA strand after deletion (G) has N-1.

So, both options have the same number.

But in the options, the selection is A-J, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, substitution changes one nucleotide in the DNA to another. So, the single DNA strand after substitution has N-1 nucleotides.

RNA is made from DNA, so same as DNA.

So, the RNA would have N.

So, the single DNA strand after substitution (B) has N-1.

The single DNA strand after deletion (G) has N-1.

So, both have N-1, which is the minimal.

But the question is a single correct option.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the substitution leads to a single strand, which is N-1.

Yes.

In this case, the correct answer is B and G. But the options are presented as a list, so perhaps the intended answer is option B.

Wait, but looking back, the options are presented as a series, so the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution leads to a single DNA strand, which has N-1, which is fewer than the RNA, mRNA, etc.

So, the conclusion is that the correct answer is B.
</think>

To determine which molecule contains the fewest number of nucleotides, we analyze each option:

1. **Option A: tRNA transcript from the original DNA**  
   tRNA is derived from RNA, which in turn is derived from DNA. Thus, the number of nucleotides in a tRNA transcript is the same as in the original DNA. This does not minimize the number of nucleotides.

2. **Option B: a single DNA strand after substitution mutation**  
   Substitution changes one nucleotide in the DNA strand, reducing the total number of nucleotides to \(N-1\). This is fewer than the original DNA, which has \(N\) nucleotides.

3. **Option C: mRNA made from the original DNA**  
   mRNA is derived directly from DNA, so the number of nucleotides in mRNA is the same as in the original DNA, \(N\). This does not minimize the number of nucleotides.

4. **Option D: spliced mRNA made from the original DNA**  
   Spliced mRNA retains the same number of nucleotides as mRNA, which is \(N\). This does not minimize the number of nucleotides.

5. **Option E: DNA after duplication**  
   DNA duplication increases the number of nucleotides by two, making the number of nucleotides \(N+2\). This does not minimize the number of nucleotides.

6. **Option F: a single DNA strand after splicing**  
   Similar to mRNA, the number of nucleotides in a spliced DNA strand is \(N\). This does not minimize the number of nucleotides.

7. **Option G: a single DNA strand after deletion mutation**  
   Deletion reduces the number of nucleotides by one, making the number of nucleotides \(N-1\). This is fewer than the original DNA, which has \(N\) nucleotides.

8. **Option H: complementary DNA**  
   Complementary DNA has the same number of nucleotides as the original DNA, \(N\). This does not minimize the number of nucleotides.

9. **Option I: cDNA made from the mRNA**  
   cDNA derived from mRNA has the same number of nucleotides as mRNA, \(N\). This does not minimize the number of nucleotides.

10. **Option J: a point mutation in the DNA**  
    A point mutation changes one nucleotide in the DNA, reducing the total number of nucleotides to \(N-1\). This is fewer than the original DNA, which has \(N\) nucleotides.

### Conclusion:
The fewest number of nucleotides is found in **Option B (a single DNA strand after substitution mutation)** and **Option G (a single DNA strand after deletion mutation)**. However, since the question requires selecting one option, **Option B** is the most appropriate answer, as it represents a scenario with fewer nucleotides compared to other options.

ANSWER: B
