Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this philosophy question. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question is about the four main divisions of philosophy. The options given are metaphysics, epistemology, axiology, and then a blank. I need to choose the correct division that completes this list.

Hmm, I remember that in philosophy, there are four main branches. Let me try to recall them. Metaphysics deals with fundamental questions about existence, reality, and the nature of reality. Epistemology is about knowledge and beliefs, right? Axiology is about values and ethics. Oh wait, I think the last one is axiology, and then the next is ethics. Oh wait, no, waitâ€”let me get this straight. So the four main divisions are usually metaphysics, epistemology, axiology, and ethics. Wait, that can't be right because that would make four branches. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people group them differently.

Wait, another thought: I think the four main branches are called the four "cornerstones" of philosophy. They are metaphysics, epistemology, axiology, and ethics. So the question says the four main divisions are metaphysics, epistemology, axiology, and ____. So the missing one after axiology is ethics. So the answer should be ethics, which is option E.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to remember: sometimes people group them as epistemology, metaphysics, axiology, ethics. That's another order. But I think the standard is to start with metaphysics, then epistemology, then axiology, and then ethics. So the question is in that order.

Looking back at the question, the first three are metaphysics, epistemology, axiology. So the next one should be ethics. So the blank is E: ethics.
