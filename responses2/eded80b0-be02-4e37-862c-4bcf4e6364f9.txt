Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that at normal body temperature, which is 37°C (98.6°F), the ionization constant of water, K_w, is 2.42 × 10^-14 moles²/liter². A physician injects a neutral saline solution into a patient. I need to find the pH of this solution once it's in thermal equilibrium with the patient's body.

Hmm. Right, so neutral saline solution. I think saline is NaCl, right? So that's sodium chloride. Sodium is a group 1 metal, and chloride is group 17. When NaCl dissolves in water, it dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions.

So the dissociation reaction would be: NaCl(s) ⇌ Na+ (aq) + Cl- (aq). Because both Na+ and Cl- are spectator ions, they don't affect the pH of the solution. So the main thing here is the concentration of H+ and OH- ions.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the pH after thermal equilibrium. But wait, the saline solution is neutral, meaning it's a solution of NaCl in water. When it's mixed with the body's solution, the concentrations of H+ and OH- might change.

Wait, but the question says the saline solution comes into thermal equilibrium with the patient's body. So the saline solution's pH would now match the pH of the body's own solution. Wait, but I'm not sure. Are the body's solutions at 37°C? Because the given K_w is at 37°C.

Wait, the initial saline solution is neutral, so it's made of Na+ and Cl- ions. So when it's mixed with the body's solution, the concentrations of these ions would depend on the volume and concentrations of both solutions. But wait, the problem doesn't give the concentrations of the saline solution. Oh wait, no, the question just says a neutral saline solution is injected. So perhaps the solution is made by dissolving a certain amount of NaCl in a given volume, but the problem doesn't specify the amount. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the saline solution is neutral, it's a 1:1 electrolyte, so each mole of NaCl gives two moles of ions (Na+ and Cl-), but for the pH, only H+ and OH- matter.

Wait, but the body's solution, at 37°C, has a K_w of 2.42e-14. Wait, when a solution has a high K_w (like pure water at 25°C, which is around 1e-14), it's neutral. But here, the body's solution has K_w = 2.42e-14. Wait, but wait, at 37°C, the K_w is lower than at 25°C. Because K_w at 25 is about 1e-14, and at higher temps it becomes smaller. So at 37, K_w is 2.42e-14, which is less than 1e-14. That means the solution is more basic than pure water at 25°C, because K_w is lower. Wait, no, wait: higher K_w means more dissociation, so higher concentration of H+ ions. So higher K_w leads to lower pH. So a K_w of 1e-14 is neutral—pH 7. A K_w of 2.4e-14 is lower than that, so the pH must be higher than 7, meaning the solution is basic.

Wait, but if the saline solution is neutral, then the concentration of H+ and OH- in it is sqrt(Kw), which is sqrt(2.42e-14) ≈ 1.556e-7 M. So in pure water, [H+] is 1.556e-7, which is pH 7. But if the solution is more basic, then [H+] would be lower than that, hence pH higher than 7.

Wait, but the problem says the saline solution is neutral. So if it's mixed with the body's solution, the concentrations of H+ and OH- would depend on the volumes and concentrations of both solutions.

Wait, but the question is about the pH after thermal equilibrium. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the saline solution is so dilute that the pH doesn't change much upon mixing. Or maybe the saline solution's pH is already at 7, so when it's mixed with the body's solution, the pH remains 7.

Wait wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem says that the physician injects a neutral saline solution into the patient. Neutral saline solution is sodium chloride. So when mixed, the concentration of H+ and OH- ions would depend on the ratio of the concentrations of the two solutions.

But wait, the problem doesn't give any information about the volumes of the saline solution or the patient's body's solution. So perhaps the pH of the saline solution is 7, and when mixed with the body's solution, the pH is determined by the body's solution's K_w.

Wait, but the body's solution has K_w = 2.42e-14. So the pH of the body's solution would be higher than 7 because K_w is lower than 1e-14 (which is neutral). So pH >7.

But the question is about the pH after thermal equilibrium. So perhaps the saline solution's pH is 7, but when mixed with the body's solution, the pH becomes 7 again. Wait, but if the two solutions are mixed, their concentrations would mix, and the pH would depend on the sum of H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps when the saline solution is mixed with the body's solution, the concentrations of H+ and OH- are such that the pH is determined by the body's solution. Or maybe the overall concentration of H+ and OH- is such that the pH is 7.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. The neutral saline solution has a concentration of NaCl, which dissociates into Na+ and Cl- ions. So the solution is 1:1 for Na+ and Cl-. In water, each of these ions is a spectator ion, so they don't contribute to H+ or OH-.

So when you mix a neutral solution (like NaCl) with another solution, say the body's solution, the resulting solution will have H+ and OH- ions based on the concentration of ions from the body's solution and the dilution from the neutral solution.

But without knowing the volumes, perhaps the question is assuming that the neutral saline solution is so dilute that it doesn't significantly affect the pH of the body's solution. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the saline solution is such that when mixed with the body's solution, the pH is determined by the body's solution's K_w. Wait, but the body's solution's K_w is 2.42e-14. So when the body's solution is neutral, pH is 7. But in this case, the question is about the pH after mixing, which would be determined by the concentration of H+ and OH- in the combined solution.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when a neutral solution is mixed with another solution in a larger volume, the pH of the mixture is determined by the concentration of ions in the final volume. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the neutral saline solution is such that it's a buffer, but since it's neutral, it doesn't contribute to the pH. So the pH of the saline solution is 7, but when mixed with the body's solution, the pH is determined by the body's solution.

Wait, but the problem states that the saline solution has been injected into the patient. The patient's body has a certain pH (probably 7), but the saline solution's pH is 7 as well. So when mixed, the concentrations of H+ and OH- would be the sum of the concentrations from both solutions, but perhaps the pH remains 7 because the concentrations are balanced.

Wait, but no—mixing two solutions of the same pH can result in a solution where the concentrations are such that pH remains same. For example, mixing equal volumes of 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M HCl would result in 0.2 M HCl, pH remains 1. But in this case, the saline solution is neutral (so no H+ or OH-), and the body's solution is basic (since K_w is lower than 1e-14, so pH >7).

Wait, so when you mix a neutral solution with a basic solution, the pH of the resulting solution depends on the concentrations. Let me think about it.

Suppose the neutral solution has a concentration of c, and the body's solution has a concentration of c_body. The neutral solution's concentration is such that [H+] = [OH-] = sqrt(Kw) = sqrt(2.42e-14) ≈ 1.556e-7 M. So in the neutral solution, [H+] = 1.556e-7 M.

When the two solutions are mixed, the total volume doubles (since we're mixing equal volumes, say each is V, so total is 2V). The concentration of H+ would be (c * [H+ from NaCl solution]) / (2V). But wait, the NaCl solution's [H+] is from the dissociation of NaCl. Hmm, no—wait. The NaCl solution's [H+] is determined by the K_w of water at 37°C, which is given as 2.42e-14. So in the saline solution, [H+] is sqrt(2.42e-14) ≈ 1.556e-7 M. But the body's solution has [H+] determined by its own K_w.

Wait, but the K_w of the body's solution is 2.42e-14. So [H+] would be sqrt(2.42e-14) which is the same as before. So [H+] in the body's solution is 1.556e-7 M. So when you mix the two, the total [H+] would be the sum of the two concentrations, but wait, no, because both are in the same volume. Let me think in terms of concentrations.

Let me denote:

In the NaCl solution: [H+] = 1.556e-7 M, [OH-] = 1.556e-7 M.

In the body's solution: [H+] = 1.556e-7 M, [OH-] = 1.556e-7 M.

Assuming the body's solution is, say, x M in [H+].

Wait, no, because K_w is [H+][OH-] = 2.42e-14. So if the body's solution has a [H+] of 1.556e-7, then [OH-] is 1.556e-7, because (1.556e-7)^2=2.42e-14. So the body's solution is neutral, pH 7.

But when mixed with the NaCl solution, the concentrations would add. So the total volume is V + V = 2V. The total moles of H+ in the NaCl solution would be (1.556e-7 M) * V. The total moles in the body's solution would be (1.556e-7 M) * V. So when mixed, the total H+ is (1.556e-7 * V + 1.556e-7 * V) / (2V) = (3.112e-7) / (2V) * V? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the total H+ moles is (H+ from NaCl) + (H+ from body). So (1.556e-7 M * V) + (1.556e-7 M * V) = 3.112e-7 * V. The total volume is 2V, so [H+] = (3.112e-7 * V) / (2V) ) = 1.556e-7 M. So the pH remains 7.

Wait, so the pH doesn't change when mixing a neutral solution with another neutral solution. Because [H+] remains 1.556e-7 M. So the pH is 7.

But wait, in the question, the saline solution is neutral, but when it's mixed with the patient's body, which has a pH of 7, the pH of the mixture would be 7.

Wait, but the problem says the saline solution is injected into the patient. So perhaps the salt is only a small quantity, so the pH doesn't change much, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the patient's body solution is considered to have a pH determined by K_w. So when the saline solution is mixed, the pH is determined by the neutralization of the NaCl with the body's solution.

Wait, but the body's solution is neutral, so [H+] = [OH-] = 1.556e-7 M. The saline solution's [H+] is also 1.556e-7 M. So when mixed, the [H+] would be the sum of the two, but wait, that would only be the case if the two solutions had different concentrations, but if they're the same volume, the concentrations just average out.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: the question is about the pH after thermal equilibrium. So perhaps the only ions present are Na+ and Cl-, which don't affect the pH. So the solution would have a pH of 7. But that's not among the options. Wait, looking at the options, option E is 7.0.

Wait, but wait. If the saline solution is neutral, its pH is 7, and the body's solution is basic, pH>7. When mixed, which solution is more concentrated? If the saline solution is diluted, maybe the pH remains 7. But if the saline solution is concentrated, perhaps the pH could change.

But the problem doesn't give any information about the volumes or concentrations of the saline solution or the body's solution, so perhaps the question is assuming that the saline solution is so dilute that it doesn't significantly affect the pH of the body's solution. So the pH remains 7.

Wait, but another possibility is that the solution itself is neutral because it's a base. No, NaCl is neutral, but if you have a salt that's a weak base, the solution might be slightly basic. But NaCl is a strong electrolyte; it dissociates completely. So the solution would be neutral after dissociation.

Wait, but wait. The K_w given is 2.42e-14. So in the body's solution, [H+] is sqrt(2.42e-14) which is about 1.556e-7 M. So pH is 7.

Now, the saline solution is neutral, so pH 7. When mixed with a neutral solution, the pH remains 7. So the pH of the mixed solution is 7.

Looking at the options, E is 7.0. So the answer would be E.

The problem involves determining the pH of a neutral saline solution (NaCl) when it comes into thermal equilibrium with a patient's body. At normal body temperature (37°C), the ionization constant of water, \( K_w \), is given as \( 2.42 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{mol}^2/\text{L}^2 \). Neutral saline solution dissociates into Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions, each contributing \( \sqrt{K_w} \approx 1.556 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \) of hydrogen ions (\( [H^+] \)) and hydroxide ions (\( [OH^-] \)), resulting in a pH of 7.

When the saline solution is mixed with the patient's body, the pH of the resulting mixture depends on the concentrations of \( [H^+] \) and \( [OH^-] \) in the combined solution. Since the saline solution is neutral (\( [H^+] = [OH^-] = 1.556 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)) and the body's solution is also neutral (\( [H^+] = [OH^-] = 1.556 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)), the concentrations of these ions are simply averaged in the mixture. As a result, the pH of the final mixture remains 7, as the concentrations of \( [H^+] \) and \( [OH^-] \) do not change due to mixing.

Given that the options provided are:

- A: 6.8  
- B: 4.9  
- C: 7.8  
- D: 7.4  
- E: 7.0  
- F: 7.2  
- G: 8.0  
- H: 5.9  
- I: 7.0  
- J: 6.5  

the correct answer is **E: 7.0**, as the pH of the neutral saline solution remains 7 when mixed with the neutral body solution.
