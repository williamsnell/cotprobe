Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the net cost of a tape recorder. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question says the list price is $32, and the discount rate is 30%. Hmm, I remember that discounts are subtracted from the original price, so I need to calculate 30% of $32 and then subtract that from $32 to get the net cost.

Wait, 30% is the same as 0.3 in decimal form. So I should multiply 32 by 0.3. Let me do that math. 32 times 0.3 equals... 9.6. So the discount is $9.60. Now, subtracting that from the list price: $32 minus $9.60. Let me do the subtraction. 32 minus 9 is 23, and subtracting 0.60 gives 22.40. So the net cost should be $22.40.

Looking at the options, option F is $22.40. So that must be the correct answer.

The discount is 30% of $32, which is $9.60. Subtracting this from the list price:

Net Cost = $32 - $9.60 = $22.40

Answer: F
