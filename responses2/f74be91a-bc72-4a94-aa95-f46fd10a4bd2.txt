Answer:

Okay, so I have this problem where Mrs. McCoy wants to maximize her total utility by choosing the right combination of soda, beer, and wine. The question gives me the marginal utilities for each product and the costs. She has a total of $17 to spend.

First, I need to remember how to maximize utility. The basic idea is that the last dollar spent should yield the highest additional utility. This is done by setting the marginal utility per dollar equal across all goods. So, for each item, the ratio of MU to price should be equal. If one has a higher ratio, it's more efficient to spend the money on that good because each dollar gives more utility.

The problem gives me the marginal utilities for each unit. Let me list them out clearly.

For soda: the first unit gives 10, second 9, third 8, fourth 7, fifth 6, sixth 5. Each costs $1.

For beer: first 50, second 40, third 30, fourth 20, fifth 16, sixth 12. Each costs $2.

For wine: first 60, second 40, third 32, fourth 24, fifth 20, sixth 16. Each costs $4.

Wait, I should also think about whether she can buy zero of a product. But since the question includes options where she buys some of each, I guess she can buy any combination, including zero, but that would require more money than available.

So, the total money is $17. Let's calculate the cost for each possible combination.

But wait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step. For each item, compute the MU per dollar. The MU per dollar should be the same across all items, or as close as possible.

So, for each product, compute MU / price.

Soda: since each costs $1, MU per soda is simply MU.

So, soda's per dollar is:

1st: 10/1 = 10

2nd: 9/1 =9

3rd:8/1=8

4th:7/1=7

5th:6/1=6

6th:5/1=5

For beer: each costs $2, so per dollar is MU/2.

1st:50/2=25

2nd:40/2=20

3rd:30/2=15

4th:20/2=10

5th:16/2=8

6th:12/2=6

For wine: each costs $4, so per dollar is MU/4.

1st:60/4=15

2nd:40/4=10

3rd:32/4=8

4th:24/4=6

5th:20/4=5

6th:16/4=4

Now, to maximize utility, Mrs. McCoy will allocate her money so that the MU per dollar is the same across all items. So, she'll shift her purchases from the product with the highest MU per dollar to the next until all her money is spent optimally.

The plan is to find the point where the MU per dollar is equal for each product, and then see which combination uses $17.

But wait, perhaps the optimal is when all the MU per dollar are equal. So, let's look for the point where the highest MU per dollar is the same for all.

Looking at the values:

Soda's per dollar starts at 10, goes down.

Beer's starts at 25, then 20, etc.

Wine starts at 15, then 10, etc.

The highest per dollar is for beer at 25. But then, soda's next is 9, which is lower than 25.

Wait, but maybe I need to find the point where the highest MU per dollar is as close as possible across all items.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the point where the marginal utilities per dollar are all equal, but that's usually the case where you can't buy more than you can afford.

Wait, but in reality, you can't buy fractions, so the next step is to buy as much as possible of the product with the highest MU per dollar until you can't anymore.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to allocate her money to buy as much as possible of each product, starting with the highest MU per dollar, until she can't buy more of it or she can't buy any more of the next.

Wait, let me think again. The optimal combination is when the last dollar spent on any product gives the same marginal utility. So, we need to find the point where the last purchase gives the same MU per dollar for each product.

But since we have three products, let's find which product has the highest MU per dollar.

Looking at the per dollar:

Soda: 10,9,8,7,6,5

Beer: 25,20,15,10,8,6

Wine:15,10,8,6,5,4

So, the highest per dollar is 25 for beer. So Mrs. McCoy will buy as much as possible of beer until her money runs out.

Wait, but wait: she has $17. Let's calculate how much each product would cost per unit.

But perhaps she should buy as much as possible of the product with the highest per dollar, then move to the next.

So, first, buy as much beer as possible.

Each beer costs $2.

Might she buy 8 units of beer? Let's see: 8 units * $2 = $16. That leaves $1 left, which isn't enough for another beer (since each is $2). So she buys 8 units. Then, she has $1 left, but no more products left, so that's it.

But wait, that's just $16, leaving $1, which won't be enough for anything. So the total utility is 8*50 + ... wait, let's compute the total utility for that.

Alternatively, maybe she can buy less of beer and buy more of other products.

Wait, let me calculate the possible options.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute the total utility for each possible combination of quantities adding up to $17 or less, choosing the one with the highest total utility.

But that might be time-consuming, but considering the options, perhaps we can find the best option.

Wait, another approach: find the optimal combination where the last dollar spent gives the same MU per dollar across all products.

So, let's see:

We can compute for each possible combination (quantity of soda, beer, wine) whether the last dollar spent gives the same MU per dollar.

But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, let's try to find the point where the MU per dollar for soda, beer, and wine are all equal or as close as possible.

Wait, but perhaps the initial approach is better. Let's see: the highest per dollar is for beer at 25. So she should buy as much as possible of beer.

But let me see what that would cost.

Since each beer is $2, 8 units cost $16, leaving $1. So she buys 8, and has $1 left.

But perhaps she can spend the remaining $1 elsewhere? Not really, because she can't buy any of the other products with $1. Because the first unit of each is at least $1 for soda, $2 for beer, and $4 for wine. So with $1, she can't buy any of the other products.

So option is to buy 8 units of beer, costing $16. Her remaining $1 is wasted.

Now, the total utility from that would be 8 * 50 = 400.

But let's see if there's a better combination.

Alternative option: buy 7 units of beer: 7 * $2 = $14. Leaves $3.

With $3, she can buy 1 soda (since soda costs $1, 3 units would cost $3), and 1 unit of something else.

Wait, let me see: $3 can buy 3 soda units.

So, 7 beer + 3 soda.

But wait, let's compute the total cost: 7*2=14, 3*1=3. Total 17.

So she can buy 7 * beer and 3 * soda.

But wait, let's check the MU per dollar for soda and beer.

For soda, the per dollar is 10 (first unit), 9 (2nd), etc.

For beer, it's 25, 20, etc.

So, in this case, the last dollar spent on beer is 20, and on soda is 10. So the last dollar in this combination (on beer) gives more than the last on soda. So she would prefer to spend the money on beer again.

Wait, perhaps she should buy more beer, but this combination uses up all $17.

Wait, let me compute the total utility for 7 beer and 3 soda.

For 7 beer: each unit gives 50, 40, 30, 20, 16, 12, 60. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first unit is 50, second 40, third 30, fourth 20, fifth 16, sixth 12. So 7 units would be 50 +40+30+20+16+12 = 168? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the total utility for 7 units of beer is:

1st:50

2nd:50+40=90

3rd:90+30=120

4th:120+20=140

5th:140+16=156

6th:156+12=168

So total for 7 units is 168.

For 3 units of soda: each unit is 10,9,8.

Total is 10+9+8=27.

Total utility is 168 +27 = 195.

Wait, but is there a better combination?

Alternatively, perhaps she can buy some wine.

Wait, but with $17, let's see. The options:

Option A: 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine.

Cost: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*4 = 2 +4 +8=14. So she has $3 left. With $3, buy one more unit of soda (costs $1), so total 3 s, 2 beer, 2 wine. But wait, the total cost is 14 +1=15. Wait, she has $17, so $2 left. So she can buy 2 more units of something. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me compute the exact options.

Wait, but perhaps the correct way is to find the option where the total cost is exactly $17, or as close as possible.

Alternatively, let's think of possible combinations:

Let me list some options and their total costs and utilities.

Option A: 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine.

Cost: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*4 = 2 +4 +8=14. So she has $3 left. With $3, buy one more unit of soda (costs $1), so total 3 s, 2 beer, 2 wine. But wait, the option given is 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine. That would be 14$ and she would have $3 left. So she can buy one more unit of soda, making it 3 s, 2 beer, 2 wine. Let's see what that would cost: 3*1 +2*2 +2*4=3+4+8=15. But she has $17, so she can actually buy 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine, and have $2 left. So that's 14, and then maybe buy 2 more options.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Another approach: Let's compute all possible combinations that add up to $17, and find which combination gives the highest utility.

Wait, but this might take a while. Let's think about the options given.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is one of the given options. Let's look through the options.

Option A: 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine.

Cost: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*4 = 2 +4 +8=14.

She has $3 left. Let's see if she can buy more. Perhaps, but none of the options beyond these. Wait, the options are the possible ones she can choose, so A is one of the options, but perhaps she can't spend all her money.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's think of another way.

Another approach: For each option, compute the total cost and total utility.

Let's go through each option.

Option A: 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine.

Cost: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*4=2+4+8=14.

She has $17, so she has $3 left. Can she buy anything else? Let's see.

In her remaining $3, she can buy one more unit of soda (costs $1). So total is 3 s, 2 beer, 2 wine.

But option A is 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine, which is cheaper (14$) than the optimal 15$ (with 3 s, 2 beer, 2 wine), but she has $3 left. So she can afford one more unit of soda, but that's not part of the option. So, the option A is a choice she can make, but it's not the optimal.

Option B:2 s,3 beer,3 wine.

Cost: 2*1 +3*2 +3*4=2 +6 +12=20. She has $17, so can't afford this. So B is not an option.

Option C:3 s,1 beer,3 wine.

Cost:3*1 +1*2 +3*4=3+2+12=17. Oh, this uses all the money. So total cost is exactly $17.

Calculating the total utility:

3 s: 10 +9 +8=27.

1 beer:50.

3 wine:60 +40 +32 =132.

Wait, wait. Wait, the third unit is 32, second is 40, first is 60. So 60+40+32 =132.

Total utility: 27+50 +132= 209.

But wait, let me confirm. Wait, wait, no. Wait, each unit is 60 for the first, 40 for the second, 32 for the third. So yeah, 60+40+32 =132.

So Option C gives 209.

Option D:2 s,4 beer,1 wine.

Cost:2*1=2; 4*2=8; 1*4=4. Total 14.

She has $3 left. Can she buy more? If she buys 1 more unit of soda, but she only has 3$, so she can't. So she's stuck at 2 s,4 beer,1 wine, with $3 unused.

Compute total utility:

2 s:10+9=19.

4 beer:50+40+30+20=140.

1 wine:60.

Total:19+140+60=219.

Wait, that's higher than option C.

Wait, but wait, wait, this is better. So option D would give her 219. But wait, what about the remaining $3? Maybe she can buy more, but the option D is 2 s,4 beer,1 wine, which totals 2 s,4 beer,1 wine, and with $3 left, she can't buy more. So option D is a possible choice, but is that the best?

But wait, perhaps there's another option.

Option E:5 s,1 beer,2 wine.

Cost:5*1=5; 1*2=2; 2*4=8. Total 5+2+8=15. She has $2 left. Maybe she can buy 2 more units of soda, but that would cost $4, which she can't afford. So option E is 5 s,1 beer,2 wine, cost 15, with $2 left.

Option F:1 s,3 beer,3 wine.

Cost:1 + 3*2=7; 3*4=12. Total 7+12=19. She has $17, so $17-19= -2. Can't buy anything. So option F is not possible.

Option G:4 s,2 beer,1 wine.

Cost:4*1=4; 2*2=4; 1*4=4. Total 4+4+4=12. She has $17-12=5 left. So she can buy 5 more units of something. Let's see.

Option H:6 s, 0 beer,2 wine.

Cost:6*1=6. 2*4=8. Total 14. She has $17-14=3 left.

So with $3, she can buy 3 more units of something. Let's see.

But perhaps the options don't include that.

So, going back to the options:

We have options A to J. Let me compute the total utility for each.

Option A: 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine.

Cost:2*1=2; 2*2=4; 2*4=8. Total 2+4+8=14.

She has $17. So $3 left. She can buy 3 more units of something, but none of the options beyond A is in the list.

Wait, but in the options, A is 2 s, 2 beer, 2 wine. So she can buy this, but not any other options. So, the total cost is 14$, so she has $3 left. Can she buy more? No, the options don't have other options beyond A. So she can choose A, but with $3 left, which isn't sufficient for any other option.

Option C:3 s, 1 beer, 3 wine.

Cost:3*1=3; 1*2=2;3*4=12. Total 3+2+12=17.

She uses all her money. So total utility is 27(s) +50(b) +132(w) = 209.

Option D:2 s,4 beer,1 wine.

Cost:2*1=2;4*2=8;1*4=4. Total 2+8+4=14$. She has $3 left. She can't buy more.

So, the total utility is 2 s:19, 4 beer:140, 1 wine:60. So total is 19+140+60=219.

Option E:5 s,1 beer,2 wine.

Cost:5*1=5;1*2=2;2*4=8. Total 5+2+8=15$. She has $2 left.

So she can buy 2 more units of soda, costing $4, but only has $2 left. So she can't. So she's stuck at 5 s,1 beer,2 wine.

Compute total utility:5 s:27, 1 beer:50, 2 wine:60+40=100. So total 27+50+100=177.

Option F:1 s,3 beer,3 wine.

Cost:1*1=1;3*2=6;3*4=12. Total 1+6+12=19. She has $17-19= -2. Can't buy anything.

Option G:4 s,2 beer,1 wine.

Cost:4*1=4;2*2=4;1*4=4. Total 4+4+4=12$. She has $17-12=5. So she can buy 5 more units of something.

But in the options, this isn't an available option. Because the options don't include 5 s, etc. So G is not an available option.

Option H:6 s, 0 beer,2 wine.

Cost:6*1=6; 2*4=8. Total 14$. She has $17-14=3 left. So she can buy 3 more units of something. Let's see which option is better.

But none of the options beyond H are present, so perhaps H is not an option.

Option I:4 s,2 beer,3 wine.

Wait, but she has $17, let's compute the cost.

4 s:4*1=4; 2 beer:2*2=4;3 wine:3*4=12. Total=4+4+12=20. She has $17, so can't afford.

So, which options are possible?

Looking at the options:

A: 2,2,2. Cost 14. She can buy 3 more units of something, but the options don't have any.

C:3,1,3. Cost 17. So she uses all her money.

D:2,4,1. Cost 14. She can't buy any more.

E:5,1,2. Cost 15. Can buy 2 more units of soda (cost $4), but she doesn't have enough.

G:4,2,1. Cost 12. She can buy 5 more units of something, but no options beyond G are present.

H:6,0,2. Cost 14. She can buy 3 more units of soda, but no option.

So, the only possible combinations are A, C, D, and H, but H isn't one of the options.

Wait, but the conclusion is that the best option is D:2 s,4 beer,1 wine, but that uses 14$, leaving $3.

Wait, but wait, the initial approach was to buy as much as possible of the highest MU per dollar, but in this case, that's beer at 25.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's compute for each combination.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the combination that gives the highest total utility.

Looking at the options given:

Option A:2 s,2 beer,2 wine: cost 14, utility 140 +40 +20 (Wait, no. Wait, compute each's per unit:

Wait, let me compute the total utility for each option.

Option A:2 s,2 beer,2 wine.

Cost:2 +4 +8=14.

Utility:

Soda:10 +9=19.

Beer:50 +40=90.

Wine:60 +40=100.

Total:19+90+100=209.

Option C:3 s,1 beer,3 wine.

Cost:3 +2 +12=17.

Utility:

Soda:10+9+8=27.

Beer:50.

Wine:60+40+32=132.

Total:27+50+132=209.

Option D:2 s,4 beer,1 wine.

Cost:2 +8 +4=14.

Utility:

Soda:19.

Beer:50*4=200.

Wait, no. Wait, for each unit, the utility is additive.

Soda:10 +9=19.

Beer:50 +40 +30 +20 +16 +12=168.

Wine:60 +40 +32=132.

Total:19+168+132=319.

Wait, that's different. So, in this case, option D gives 319, which is higher than options A and C (209 each). So, option D is better.

But wait, what about the remaining $3? She can't buy any more, but the options don't include that.

Wait, but in the options given, option D is 2 s,4 beer,1 wine.

So, the calculation for option D is 19 + 168 + 132 = 319.

So, that's the highest among the options.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me re-calculate option D.

2 s: each unit is 10,9. So 10+9=19.

4 beer: each unit is 50,40,30,20. So 50+40+30+20=140.

1 wine:60+40+32=132.

Total:19+140=159; 159+132=291. Wait, that's not correct.

Wait, no: 19 (soda) +140 (4 beer) =159. Then 159 +132 (1 wine)=291.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 319, but that's incorrect.

So, the correct total is 19+140=159; 159+132=291.

Wait, that's not right. Because 19 +140 is 159, plus 132 is 291. So, option D gives 291, which is less than option C's 209.

Wait, so option A is 209, option C is 209. So, both are higher than option D.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, let me recalculate each option.

Option A: 2 s,2 beer,2 wine.

Cost:2 +4 +8=14.

Utility: 2 s:10+9=19.

2 beer:50+40=90.

2 wine:60+40=100.

Total:19+90=109; 109+100=209.

So, option A is 209.

Option B: 2 s,3 beer,3 wine.

Cost:2 +6 +12=20. Can't afford.

Option C:3 s,1 beer,3 wine.

Cost:3 +2 +12=17.

Utility:3 s:10+9+8=27.

1 beer:50.

3 wine:60+40+32=132.

Total:27+50=77; 77+132=209.

Option D:2 s,4 beer,1 wine.

Cost:2+8+4=14.

Utility:2 s:10+9=19.

4 beer:50+40+30+20=140.

1 wine:60+40+32=132.

Total:19+140=159; 159+132=291.

So, option D is 291, which is higher than options A and C.

Wait, that's a problem because the options given don't include option D's cost.

Wait, no, option D is 2 s,4 beer,1 wine, which costs 14$, so it's within the budget.

So, the correct highest is option D, which gives 291.

But wait, that's not correct. Because option C is 209, and option D is 291, which is higher. So, the answer should be option D.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A:2 s,2 beer,2 wine.

B:2 s,3 beer,3 wine.

C:3 s,1 beer,3 wine.

D:2 s,4 beer,1 wine.

E:5 s,1 beer,2 wine.

F:1 s,3 beer,3 wine.

G:4 s,2 beer,1 wine.

H:6 s,0 beer,2 wine.

So, the answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought of option C and D. So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me compute the correct option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the utilities of option D.

Wait, option D:2 s,4 beer,1 wine.

Cost:2 +8 +4=14.

Utility:

Soda:10 +9=19.

4 beer:50 +40 +30 +20=140.

1 wine:60 +40 +32=132.

Total:19 +140=159; 159 +132=291.

So, correct.

So, the highest utility is option D, with 291.

Wait, but in the options, option D is 2 s,4 beer,1 wine.

But let's compute the total cost for option D: 2*1=2, 4*2=8, 1*4=4. Total 2+8+4=14$, which is correct.

So, the answer is D.
</think>

The correct answer is D: 2 bottles of soda, 4 bottles of beer, and 1 bottle of wine. This combination uses the entire $14 budget and provides the highest total utility.

ANSWER: D
