Okay, let's tackle this multiple-choice question step by step. The question is about identifying a type of consumer product that's bought relatively infrequently and requires consumers to update their knowledge before purchasing. 

First, I'll read through the options again to make sure I understand each one correctly. The options are A through J, each with a different type of product. The key points are that the product is infrequent in purchase and that consumers need to update their knowledge before making a decision.

Let's break down each option:

A: Service product. These are products that provide ongoing services, like telephone, internet, or healthcare. They might be bought infrequently but don't necessarily require updating knowledge before purchase. They might be something you use once, but if you don't know much, maybe not a problem. But service products might be more about usage than upfront knowledge.

B: Durable product. These are products designed to withstand use, like furniture or electronics. They are usually bought often because durability is important, but they might not require much knowledge update. They are probably more about functionality and maintenance than upfront information.

C: Shopping product. This seems broad. It could include a lot of products. Some shopping products might require knowledge update, like choosing between different brands or features. But the question is about something that's bought infrequently, so maybe not the main category. Also, this could be too generic.

D: Generic products. These are products that are widely available and not tailored to specific needs. They're probably bought in large quantities because they are common, so maybe infrequent isn't the right match.

E: Impulse product. These are products that you buy when you're feeling impulse or driven by quick decisions. Since they're bought on the spot, maybe they don't require much knowledge update before purchase. They're more about convenience and quick decisions.

F: Luxury product. Luxury products are expensive and often designed for special occasions. They are typically bought infrequently because they're expensive and people might not need them regularly. However, some luxury products might require knowledge update, like choosing between different luxury brands. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

G: Speciality product. These are products that are niche and not as common. They might be bought infrequently because they're special and not widely used. They might require knowledge update because consumers are interested in specific things, but I'm not certain if this is the primary category.

H: Promotional product. These are products designed to promote something else, like a sale or coupon. They might be bought infrequently if there's a limited supply or if they're a one-time offer. However, promotional products might require knowledge update, especially if they're for a new product line.

I: Unsought product. This sounds like a strong candidate. It's bought infrequently because it's not commonly desired, and consumers might not know enough about it before making a purchase. So, unsought products are products that are not desired by many people and require knowledge update before purchasing.

J: Branded products. These are products that are associated with a specific brand name. They might be bought in large quantities because they're popular, but some could be bought infrequently if they're niche. However, being brand-specific might mean they need some knowledge update about the brand before purchase.

Now, the question is asking for a product that's bought infrequently and requires updating knowledge. Let's think about unsought products. They're products that people don't really want, so they might not be in high demand, hence bought infrequently. But do they require updating knowledge before purchase? Yes, because people might not know much about the product, or it could be a new product line, so they might need to research it before deciding to buy it. 

Looking at the other options, unsought products (I) fit this description better than others. For example, luxury products (F) could be bought infrequently, but luxury products are usually expensive and might require knowledge update, but they're not necessarily unsought. Similarly, generic products (D) are bought infrequently but are more common, not necessarily unsought.

So the correct answer should be I: unsought product.

The correct answer is **I: Unsought product**. This type of product is bought infrequently because it is not desired by many people, and consumers may not be aware of its specifics before making a purchase. It requires updating knowledge, such as researching the product line or brand, before deciding to buy it.

Answer: I
