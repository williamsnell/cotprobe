Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about categorical grants. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking for an example of a categorical grant. The options are A to G. Let me first recall what a grant is in general. A grant is a small amount of money given to an organization to help it perform a specific task or achieve a goal. Categorical grants, I think, are a type of grant where there's a specific purpose or requirement, often tied to a particular program or establishment.

Looking at the options:

A: Federal government money to states for military defense. That sounds more like a federal agency, not a grant. Maybe a federal initiative, but not specifically a grant.

B: Federal money to prevent bankruptcy. Wait, that's about preventing a state from failing. I'm not sure if that's a grant or a prevention mechanism. Maybe a policy rather than a grant.

C: Federal money to states for Head Start programs. Head Start is a state or federal program, right? So this is a grant being used for a specific purpose, so C seems like a good candidate.

D: Federal money for infrastructure projects. Infrastructure can be a broad term. It might not be tied specifically to a state, but it's generally a grant applied to a specific project.

E: Federal money to states without conditions. That doesn't specify the purpose, so it's more like a regular grant without any specific use.

F: Federal money to a private company to prevent it from failing. Again, this seems more like a policy or a prevention rather than a grant, as it's not tied to a specific program.

G: Federal money to cities without any specific use. Like option E, it's a grant without any conditions, so probably not a grant in the traditional sense.

So, the key here is that categorical grants are specific grants that are tied to a specific purpose or program. Let's go back. Option C is federal money specifically for Head Start. That fits the definition of a grant because it's a specific program (Head Start) and the money is used under conditions tied to that program.

Options B and F are more about prevention or preventing failure, which I think are more about policies or measures rather than grants. So the best answer is C.

The correct answer is C: money given by the federal government to states to fund Head Start early education programs.
