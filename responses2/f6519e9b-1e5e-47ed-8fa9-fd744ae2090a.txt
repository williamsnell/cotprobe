Okay, so I've got this question here about how much silver is deposited on a spoon. Hmm, I remember something about electrochemistry from school. Let me think. The question gives me the current and time, so I should probably use Faraday's laws of electrolysis.

Wait, the formula is Q = I * t, right? Oh wait, but Faraday's is about moles, so it's Q = n * F, where F is Faraday's constant. Oh wait, I think the correct formula is n = Q/(F). Faraday's constant is about 96485 C/mol, I think.

So first, I need to calculate the charge passed. The current is 0.50 A for 20 minutes. Oh wait, I should convert minutes to seconds. 20 minutes is 20 * 60 = 1200 seconds. So Q = I * t = 0.50 A * 1200 s = 600 Coulombs.

Now, the formula is n = Q / F. So n would be 600 C divided by 96485 C/mol. Let me calculate that. 600 / 96485 is approximately 0.00622 moles of electrons.

Wait, but since silver is anions (Ag+), each mole of Ag requires one mole of electrons. So the moles of Ag deposited would be the same as the moles of electrons. So n_Ag = 0.00622 mol.

Now, to find the mass, I need the molar mass of silver. Silver's atomic weight is about 107.87 g/mol. So mass = moles * molar mass. So 0.00622 mol * 107.87 g/mol â‰ˆ 0.671 grams.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.671 gm. So the answer should be J.

To determine how much silver is deposited on a spoon, we use Faraday's law of electrolysis. The formula is:

\[
n = \frac{Q}{F}
\]

Where:
- \( Q \) is the charge (in coulombs),
- \( F \) is Faraday's constant (\( 96485 \, \mathrm{C/mol} \)),
- \( n \) is the number of moles of electrons.

### Step 1: Calculate the charge (\( Q \))
The current (\( I \)) is \( 0.50 \, \mathrm{A} \) and the time (\( t \)) is \( 20 \, \mathrm{minutes} \). Converting time to seconds:
\[
t = 20 \times 60 = 1200 \, \mathrm{s}
\]
\[
Q = I \times t = 0.50 \times 1200 = 600 \, \mathrm{C}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the moles of electrons (\( n \))
\[
n = \frac{Q}{F} = \frac{600}{96485} \approx 0.00622 \, \mathrm{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mass of silver deposited
Silver (\( \mathrm{Ag} \)) has a molar mass of \( 107.87 \, \mathrm{g/mol} \). Since each mole of silver requires one mole of electrons:
\[
\text{Mass of Ag} = n \times \text{molar mass of Ag} = 0.00622 \times 107.87 \approx 0.671 \, \mathrm{g}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mass of silver deposited is approximately \( 0.671 \, \mathrm{g} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
