Question:

It is estimated that 3 × 10^5 tons of sulfur dioxide, SO_2, enters the atmosphere daily owing to the burning of coal and petroleum products. Assuming an even distribution of the sulfur dioxide throughout the earth's atmosphere (which is not the case) , calculate in parts per million by weight the concentration of SO_2 added daily to the atmosphere. The weight of the atmosphere is 4.5 × 10^15 tons. (On the average, about 40 days are required for the removal of the SO_2 by rain).

Options:

A: 1.5 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2
B: 3.0 × 10^5 ppm SO_2
C: 5 × 10^-6 ppm SO_2
D: 7 × 10^-6 ppm SO_2
E: 6.67 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2
F: 1.2 × 10^-4 ppm SO_2
G: 9.0 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2
H: 4.5 × 10^15 ppm SO_2
I: 2.0 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2
J: 8 × 10^-5 ppm SO_2

Okay, so I've got this problem here about sulfur dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Hmm, I need to calculate the concentration of SO2 in parts per million by weight. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that 3 × 10^5 tons of SO2 enter the atmosphere daily. And the weight of the entire atmosphere is given as 4.5 × 10^15 tons. They also mention that it takes about 40 days to remove the SO2 through rain. Wait, but for calculating concentration, I think I only need the daily amount, right? Because concentration is a daily measure, I guess.

So, parts per million by weight (ppm) is a measure of concentration. I remember that ppm is typically expressed as mg/kg, but the question asks for ppm by weight. Let me think about the units.

Wait, the formula for concentration in ppm (parts per million) when dealing with mass is (mass of solute / mass of solution) × 1e6. But in this case, the solution is the atmosphere, and it's a lot more massive than the solute, so maybe I can approximate it as (mass of SO2) / (mass of atmosphere) × 1e6.

So, let's calculate the concentration. The mass of SO2 is 3 × 10^5 tons. The total atmosphere is 4.5 × 10^15 tons. But wait, I should convert tons to kilograms because the units for ppm are typically in kg. Oh right, 1 ton is 1e3 kg, so 3e5 tons is 3e8 kg, and 4.5e15 tons is 4.5e18 kg.

So, the concentration in kg per kg is (3e8 kg) / (4.5e18 kg) = let's compute that. Dividing 3e8 by 4.5e18: 3/4.5 is 0.666..., and 1e8 / 1e18 is 1e-10. So 0.666... × 1e-10 is about 6.666e-11.

But wait, that gives me the concentration as 6.666e-11 kg/kg. But ppm is (kg/kg) × 1e6. So 6.666e-11 × 1e6 = 6.666e-5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 6.67e-5 ppm, which matches that calculation. Alternatively, let me double-check the steps. Maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversions.

Wait, let me re-calculate the initial conversion. 3 × 10^5 tons of SO2 is 3e5 * 1e3 kg = 3e8 kg. The atmosphere is 4.5 ×10^15 tons, which is 4.5e15 * 1e3 kg = 4.5e18 kg. So the ratio is 3e8 / 4.5e18 = (3/4.5) * 1e-10 = 0.666...e-10 = 6.666e-11. Multiply by 1e6 gives 6.666e-5. So that's about 6.67e-5, which is option E.

Wait, but the problem mentions the time taken for removal—40 days—but I don't think that affects the daily concentration calculation. So the daily concentration is just the amount added each day divided by the total mass, multiplied by ppm factor.

Hmm, but wait, the question says to calculate the concentration in parts per million by weight. Wait, isn't ppm typically in terms of parts per million by mass, which is [mg/kg] or [ppm] where ppm is mg per kg. So our calculation is correct.

So the answer should be E, 6.67e-5 ppm. Let me check the options:

Options:
A: 1.5e-5
B: 3e5 (this can't be right)
C: 5e-6
D: 7e-6
E: 6.67e-5
F: 1.2e-4
G: 9e-5
H: 4.5e15 (too big)
I: 2e-5
J: 8e-5

So E is the correct choice.

To calculate the concentration of SO₂ in parts per million by weight (ppm) in the atmosphere, we start by converting the given values to consistent units. The mass of SO₂ entering the atmosphere daily is \( 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{tons} = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{kg} \), and the total mass of the atmosphere is \( 4.5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{tons} = 4.5 \times 10^{18} \, \text{kg} \).

The concentration in kg/kg is calculated as:
\[
\frac{\text{Mass of SO}_2}{\text{Mass of atmosphere}} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{4.5 \times 10^{18}} = 6.666 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{kg/kg}.
\]

To convert this to ppm (parts per million), we multiply by \( 10^6 \):
\[
6.666 \times 10^{-11} \times 10^6 = 6.666 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{ppm}.
\]

This matches option E: \( 6.67 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{ppm SO}_2 \).

The time taken for removal (40 days) is not relevant to calculating the daily concentration, as the problem focuses on the daily addition of SO₂ to the atmosphere.
