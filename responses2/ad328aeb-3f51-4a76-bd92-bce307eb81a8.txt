Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the aspects of being a grandparent, and I need to figure out which option is NOT one of the most rewarding things grandparents report. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. It asks which option is NOT one of the most rewarding aspects of being a grandparent. The options are A to J.

I remember that grandparents often talk about positive experiences and things they're grateful for. So I'll go through each option and assess them.

Option A: Sharing wisdom and life experiences. That makes sense because grandparents spend time talking to grandchildren about life, history, and lessons. Definitely a rewarding aspect.

Option B: Having a second chance at parenting. Grandparents often get to go back to their own roles, teaching their grandchildren lessons. This is definitely a positive experience, so B is something grandparents would appreciate.

Option C: Watching grandchildren grow and develop. This is about supporting their child's education and physical well-being. It's a positive aspect, so C is definitely a rewarding choice.

Option D: Having others to wait on you. This is about the support and companionship grandchildren provide. grandparents often feel supported, so D is a positive point.

Option E: Reliving their own childhood through their grandchildren. grandparents often talk about how grandchildren's memories of their past can bring them back to their own lives. This is a very personal and rewarding experience.

Option F: Having an excuse to indulge in childish activities. While this might be a positive thing for the grandchildren, grandparents might not find it as rewarding because it's more about the grandchildren's choices rather than the grandparent's feelings.

Option G: Spoiling the grandchildren. While some people might enjoy it, I'm not sure if this is a very rewarding aspect. Spoiling might be more about the grandchild's enjoyment, but it's not something grandparents would typically report as something they're looking forward to. So maybe G is not a rewarding aspect.

Option H: Feelings of immortality. This is more of a philosophical or existential thought, not a practical rewarding experience. grandparents don't usually feel this way about being able to spend time with family forever.

Option I: Being able to spend quality time with family. grandparents can spend quality time with their grandchildren, which is a positive aspect.

Option J: Remembering when they were grandchildren. grandparents often talk about how they used to be their grandchildren, which is a very positive experience.

Now, the question is which is NOT one of the most rewarding. So looking at the options, E and H are both possible candidates. Let me think about what each option entails.

E is about reliving childhood memories through grandchildren's memories. grandparents probably find this very rewarding because it's about the grandchildren's perspective and the warmth it brings.

H, on the other hand, is about feelings of immortality. I'm not sure if grandparents feel this way. It's more philosophical and personal, something that might not be the most rewarding in the grandparent's experience.

So the question is asking which is NOT rewarding. If H is not a rewarding aspect, then it's the answer. But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes grandparents do feel a sense of immortality, but it's not something grandparental experiences are typically highlighted.

Wait, let me think again. The best options are A through J, and E and H are the ones to consider. The question is about which is NOT a rewarding aspect. So E is definitely rewarding because it's about the grandchildren's memories. H is possibly not as rewarding because it's more of an abstract or philosophical experience, not one that is often highlighted as something grandparental would feel good about.

Therefore, the answer should be H.

The correct answer is **H: Feelings of immortality**. 

**Explanation:**
Grandparents often report feeling a strong sense of immortality, as it relates to their ability to spend quality time with their grandchildren. This is a very positive and rewarding experience. On the other hand, feeling of immortality is more of a philosophical or existential thought, not one that is typically highlighted as a rewarding aspect of being a grandparent. Therefore, option H is the correct answer as it is not a rewarding aspect.
