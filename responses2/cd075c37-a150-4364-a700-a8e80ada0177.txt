Okay, so I have this problem here about poison gas, phosgene, and I need to find out how many molecules were released. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that 1.1 × 10^8 kg of phosgene gas was used. I remember that to find the number of molecules, I need to use Avogadro's number and the molar mass of the substance. 

First, let me write down what I know. Phosgene is CCl3N, right? So its molecular formula is CCl3N. Let me calculate the molar mass. Carbon is about 12 g/mol, Cl is around 35.5 g/mol, and N is about 14 g/mol. So adding them up: 12 + (3*35.5) + 14. Let me compute that. 3*35.5 is 106.5. So 12 + 106.5 is 118.5 plus 14 is 132.5 g/mol. So the molar mass is 132.5 g/mol.

Wait, but the given mass is 1.1 × 10^8 kg. Oh, I need to convert that to grams because the molar mass is in grams per mole. So 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 1.1e8 kg is 1.1e11 grams. Wait, no, 1.1e8 kg is 110,000,000 kg, which is 1.1 × 10^11 grams. Oh wait, wait, 1.1e8 kg equals 1.1 × 10^11 grams. Because 10^8 kg is 1e11 grams because kg to g is multiply by 1e3, so 1e8 kg is 1e11 g.

So now, the number of moles is mass divided by molar mass. Moles = (1.1e11 g) / (132.5 g/mol). Let me compute that. 1.1e11 divided by 132.5. Let me approximate. 132.5 is about 130. So 1.1e11 / 130 is roughly (1.1/130) × 1e11. 1.1 divided by 130 is about 0.00846, so 0.00846e11 is 8.46e8 moles. Wait, more accurately, let's compute 1.1e11 / 132.5. Let me do that division properly.

Dividing 1.1e11 by 132.5. Let's divide 1.1 by 132.5. 132.5 * 84 = 11130? Wait, 132.5 * 80 is 10,600. 132.5 * 84 is 132.5*(80+4) = 10600 + 530=11130. But 1.1e11 is 110,000,000,000. So 132.5 × x = 110,000,000,000. Let me compute x = 110e9 / 132.5.

Dividing 110e9 by 132.5: Let's write 132.5 in terms of 5/40? No, perhaps better to compute 110 / 132.5 first. 132.5 goes into 110 how many times? Well, 132.5 is bigger than 110, so 0.8 times? Wait, 132.5 * 0.8 is 106. So 0.8 × 132.5 = 106. So 106 is 0.8 times. So 110 is 0.8 + (4/132.5). 4/132.5 is approximately 0.03. So x is approximately 0.83. So x ≈ 0.83. So moles = 0.83e8, which is 8.3e7 moles. Wait, wait, no, 1.1e11 /132.5 is (1.1/132.5) × 1e11. Let me compute 1.1 / 132.5. 132.5 is 53/4, wait perhaps better to compute 1.1 / 132.5.

Wait, 132.5 × 0.0083 is about 1.1. Because 132.5 × 0.008 is 1.06, and 132.5 × 0.0003 is 0.03975. So 0.0083 ×132.5 is about 1.1. So 1.1 /132.5 = 0.0083.

So moles = 0.0083 × 1e8? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no: 1.1e11 /132.5 = (1.1 /132.5 ) × 1e11. 1.1 /132.5 is approximately 0.0083. So 0.0083 × 1e11 is 8.3e8 moles. Wait, wait, 0.0083e11 is 8.3e8. Oh, wait, 8.3e8 is 830,000,000 moles? That can't be right. Wait, no, no, wait. 0.0083 × 1e11 is 8.3e8? Let me compute that again. 0.0083 * 1e11 = 8.3e8? No, 1e11 is 10^11, 0.0083 is 8.3e-3. So 8.3e-3 ×1e11 =8.3e8 (since 1e11 *1e-3=1e8). Yeah, that's correct.

So moles = 8.3e8.

Wait, but let me double-check, because sometimes I make mistakes in exponents.

Wait, 1.1e11 is 110,000,000,000 grams. Divided by 132.5 g/mol:

110,000,000,000 / 132.5 = let me compute that. Let me change it to a calculator-like step:

132.5 × 83,000,000 = ?

Wait, 132.5 * 83 million is 132.5 *8.3e7 = 1.10375e9 grams. Wait, but 132.5 *83,000,000 is 132.5 *8.3e7 = (132.5 *8.3) *1e7. 132.5 *8=1060, 132.5*0.3=39.75, so total is 1099.75. So 1099.75e7 =1.09975e10 grams. But the target is 1.1e11 grams. Hmm, so 83 million would give 1.09975e10 grams, which is about 10^10, but target is 1e11. So perhaps 830 million would give 1.09975e10 *10 =1.09975e11, which is 110,000,000,000 grams. Oh wait, that's exactly 1.1e11. So 830 million moles.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 830 million is 8.3e8. So 8.3e8 moles of phosgene.

Wait, but that's a lot. Because 1 mole is 6.022e23 molecules. So number of molecules is moles × Avogadro's number.

So molecules = 8.3e8 * 6.022e23. Let me compute that.

First, 8.3e8 is 8.3 × 1e8.

Multiply by 6.022e23: (8.3 ×6.022) ×1e31.

8.3 ×6.022 is approximately 8 *6 is 48, but more accurately, 8 *6=48, 0.3*6=1.8 → 49.8, plus 8 *0.022=0.176, and 0.3 *0.022=0.0066. So 49.8 + 0.176=50. 50 +0.0066=50.0066. So about 50.0066.

Wait, 8.3 *6.022 = let's do it step by step.

6.022 ×8 =48.176.

6.022 ×0.3=1.8066.

So 48.176 +1.8066 = 50.  (since 48.176 +1.8066 = 50. (Wait, 48.176 +1.8066 is 49.9826, approximately 50.003)).

So 50.003e31 = 5.0003e32 molecules.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option F is 6.6e32. Hmmm, but my calculation gives around 5e32. Which option is that near? Let me check calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial calculation.

Wait, maybe I should re-calculate the number of moles.

Let me start again.

The mass is 1.1e8 kg. Convert to grams: 1.1e8 kg ×1000 g/kg =1.1e11 g.

Molar mass of phosgene is CCl3N. So each C is 12, Cl is 35.5, N is 14.

Molar mass = 12 + 3*(35.5) +14.

3*(35.5) is 106.5. Then 12 +14 =26. So 106.5 +26=132.5 g/mol.

So moles = 1.1e11 g /132.5 g/mol.

Calculate that:

1.1e11 / 132.5.

Wait, 132.5 is the same as 53/4. So, 1.1e11 / (53/4) = (1.1e11) * (4/53) ) = (4.4e11) /53.

What's 4.4e11 divided by 53?

Let me compute 4.4e11 /53.

53 into 4.4e11.

Well, 53 ×8e7 =4.24e9. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 4.4e11 /53.

Divide 4.4 by 53: 4.4/53 = approx 0.083. So 0.083e11, which is 8.3e9.

Wait, 0.083e11 is 8.3e9 moles.

Wait, wait, that's 8.3e9 moles. Because 53 ×8.3e9 is 53 *8.3e9= (53*8.3) *1e9. 53 ×8=424, 53×0.3=15.9 → 439.9. So 439.9e9 =4.399e11. Hmm, but I was trying to compute 4.4e11/53.

Wait, 4.4e11 /53 is approx 8.3e9 moles.

Wait, but earlier I thought of 8.3e8, but this seems different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent during the second calculation.

Wait, let me try again. 1.1e11 /132.5 = ?

132.5 × x =1.1e11 → x=1.1e11 /132.5.

Let me compute this as:

1.1e11 = 1.1 * 1e11.

132.5=1.325e2.

So x = (1.1 *1e11) / (1.325e2) = (1.1 /1.325) *1e9.

Compute 1.1 /1.325. Let's see, 1.325 × 0.83 is about 1.1.

Wait, 1.325 ×0.83 = (1 *0.83) + (0.325 *0.83) =0.83 + 0.27025=1.10025. So 0.83.

So 1.1 /1.325 ≈0.83.

So x ≈0.83e9 → 8.3e8 moles.

Wait, so that part is correct. So moles =8.3e8.

Wait, but earlier I thought 1.1e11 /132.5 is 8.3e9, but that doesn't make sense. Because 132.5 is 1.325e2, and 1e11 is 1e9 *1e2. So 1e11 /1e2 =1e9. So 1.1e11 /132.5 = (1.1 /132.5) *1e9?

Wait, perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong. Let me compute 1.1e11 /132.5.

Let me compute 132.5 × 83,000,000 = ?

132.5 ×83e6 =132.5 *8.3e7 = (132.5 ×8.3) ×1e7.

132.5 ×8=1060, 132.5 ×0.3=39.75 → total 1099.75. So 1099.75 ×1e7 =1.09975e10 grams.

Wait, but 1e11 is 10 times that, so 83 million would give 1e10 grams. Oh wait, 83 million is 8.3e8? No, 83 million is 8.3e9? Wait, 8.3e9 is 83,000,000,000.

Wait, I'm getting confused with exponents. Let me think.

132.5 × 83,000,000 = 132.5 ×8.3e7 = 1.09975e10 grams (since 8.3e7 is 83 million, 8.3e8 is 830 million). Wait, 83 million is 8.3e7. So 8.3e7 ×132.5 = 1.09975e10 grams.

But the target is 1.1e11 grams. So 83 million gives 1.09975e10, which is close to 1.1e11?

Wait, 1.09975e10 is 10.9975e9, which is 1.09975e10 grams. Our target is 1.1e11, which is 110e9. So 1.09975e10 is about 10.9975e9, which is 0.99975e11. So that's 99.975% of the target.

Hmm, but perhaps I should use more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 8.3e8 × Avogadro's number.

Wait, 8.3e8 *6.022e23 = (8.3 *6.022) ×1e31.

Compute 8.3 *6.022.

6 *8=48, 0.022 *8=0.176 → 48.176.

6 *0.3=1.8, 0.022 *0.3=0.0066 → 1.8066.

Wait, adding 48.176 +1.8066=50. (wait, 48.176 +1.8066=50 (exactly, 48.176 +1.8066=50. (Yes)).

Wait, 0.022 *6 is 0.132 and 0.022 *0.3 is 0.0066, so 0.132 +0.0066=0.1386. So 6.022 ×8=48.176, and 6.022 ×0.3=1.8066. So sum is 48.176 +1.8066=50 (exactly 49.9826). So 50. approximately 50.

So 8.3 *6.022 ≈50. So 50 ×1e31 →5e32.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 6.6e32, option H is 6e32, option J is 8e32.

Wait, but our calculation is 5e32. But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, let me try another approach. Mass is 1.1e8 kg → 1.1e11 grams.

Molar mass is 132.5 g/mol.

Moles = 1.1e11 /132.5 → let me compute 1.1e11 ÷132.5.

Let me compute 1.1e11 =1.1 *1e11.

Divide by 132.5:

1.1e11 /132.5 = (1.1 /132.5) *1e11.

1.1 /132.5 = let me do it as division of 1.1 by 132.5.

Let me write it as 1.1 ÷132.5.

132.5 × 0.0083 = approx 1.1. Let me compute 132.5 × 0.0083:

132.5 × 0.008 = 1.06.

132.5 ×0.0003=0.03975.

So 0.0083 ×132.5=1.06+0.03975=1.09975.

Which is less than 1.1.

So 0.0083 ×132.5=1.09975 grams.

But we need 1.1 grams.

The difference is 1.1 -1.09975 =0.00025 grams.

So how much more do we need to multiply by 132.5 to get an additional 0.00025 grams?

We have 0.00025 grams. So 0.00025 /132.5 = approx 1.88e-6.

So 0.0083 +1.88e-6 ≈0.0083188.

So 0.0083188 ×132.5 =1.1 grams.

So (1.1 ÷132.5)=0.0083188.

So moles =0.0083188 ×1e11 =8.3188e8 moles.

So approximately 8.319e8 moles.

Now, the number of molecules is moles × Avogadro's number.

Which is 8.319e8 ×6.022e23.

Let me compute 8.319e8 ×6.022e23:

First, 8.319 ×6.022 = let me calculate 8 ×6=48, 8 ×0.022=0.176, 0.319 ×6=1.914, 0.319 ×0.022≈0.007018. So summing all:

48 +0.176 =48.176.

48.176 +1.914=50.09.

50.09 +0.007018=50.097018.

So approximately 50.097.

So 8.319e8 ×6.022e23 = (8.319 ×6.022) × 1e31.

Which is approximately 50.097 ×1e31 =5.0097e32.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1.1e8

B) 1.1e9

C) 1.1e10

D) 1.1e11

E) 1.1e12

F) 6.6e32 → which is 6.6 ×1e32.

H) 6e32.

J) 8e32.

So I got about 5e32, which is 5 ×1e32. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute it differently. Let me compute moles as:

Moles = (1.1e8 kg) × (1000 g/kg) × (1 mol /132.5 g) )

So:

1.1e8 *1000 =1.1e11 g.

1.1e11 /132.5 = let me compute this division.

132.5 ×83e6 =132.5 ×8.3e8? No, 83e6 is 8.3e8. Wait, no, 83e6 is 83 million, which is 8.3e7.

Wait, let me think differently.

Compute 1.1e11 /132.5 = (1.1e11) / (1.325e2) ) → (1.1 /1.325 ) × (1e11 /1e2) ) → (approx 0.83) × 1e9 → 8.3e8.

So moles =8.3e8.

Wait, but earlier I thought of 8.3e9, but that was a miscalculation. Let me correct that.

Wait, no, 1.1e11 /132.5 is 8.3e8. So the number of molecules is 8.3e8 ×6.022e23.

Which is 8.3e8 ×6.022e23 = (8.3 ×6.022) ×1e31.

8.3 ×6.022 ≈50.09.

So 50.09e31 →5.009e32 molecules.

Hmm, but the options don't have 5e32. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the moles calculation. Let me compute 1.1e11 /132.5.

132.5 ×8.3e8 → 8.3e8 ×132.5 is 1.1e10 grams, which is 10e9 grams. But we have 1.1e11 grams. So that's 10 times more than needed.

Wait, so 8.3e8 moles would give 1e10 grams. But we have 1.1e11 grams, which is 10 times more.

Wait, perhaps I should find the moles as (1.1e11) / (132.5) → let me compute that division.

1.1e11 =1.1 ×1e11.

Divided by 132.5 =1.325 ×1e2.

So (1.1 /1.325 ) × (1e11 /1e2) ) = (approx 0.83) ×1e9 →8.3e8.

Wait, that's correct. So I'm confident that moles =8.3e8.

Wait, but then the number of molecules is 8.3e8 ×6.022e23 =5.008e32.

Hmm. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial unit conversion.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Let me compute the total mass in grams, then the moles, then the number of molecules.

Mass in kg:1.1e8 kg.

Convert to grams: 1.1e8 kg ×1000 g/kg =1.1e11 g.

Molar mass of phosgene (CCl3N):

Each C: 12 g/mol, Cl:35.5, N:14.

So:

C:12 ×1=12.

Cl:35.5 ×3=106.5.

N:14 ×1=14.

Total:12 +106.5 +14=132.5 g/mol.

So moles = 1.1e11 g /132.5 g/mol = (1.1 /132.5) ×1e11 ≈0.0083188 ×1e11 →8.3188e8 mol.

So yes, 8.3188e8 moles.

Number of molecules =8.3188e8 ×6.022e23.

Compute 8.3188 ×6.022 = ?

Let me compute 8 ×6 =48.

8 ×0.022=0.176.

0.3188 ×6=1.9128.

0.3188 ×0.022≈0.0070136.

Adding all together:

48 +0.176 =48.176.

48.176 +1.9128=50.0888.

50.0888 +0.0070136≈50.0958.

So 8.3188 ×6.022≈50.0958.

So 50.0958 ×1e31 →5.00958e32 molecules.

Rounded to about 5.01e32 molecules.

But the options are:

F) 6.6e32

H) 6e32

J) 8e32.

Wait, none of them match 5e32. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial mass is 1.1e8 kg. Wait, maybe that's the mass of the poison gas, but I think I was correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of molecules in another way.

Wait, another approach: 1 mole →6.022e23 molecules.

1 mole →132.5g.

So, the number of molecules per gram is (6.022e23) /132.5.

So per gram, 6.022e23 /132.5 = approx 4.55e20 molecules per gram.

So, 1.1e11 grams ×4.55e20 molecules/g → 1.1e11 ×4.55e20 = (1.1 ×4.55) ×1e31 →5.005 ×1e31 →5.005e31 molecules.

Wait, that's different again. Wait, now I'm getting 5e31. So this is conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this calculation using exact fractions.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moles as:

Molar mass of phosgene is 132.5 g/mol.

Mass is 1.1e8 kg →1.1e8 ×1000 g =1.1e11 g.

Moles =1.1e11 /132.5 = (1.1 ×1e11 ) / (132.5 ).

132.5 is 132.5 =53 ×2.5.

Wait, 132.5 = (5 ×26.5) → perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.1e11 /132.5 as exact division.

132.5 ×83188000 = ?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the answer using exponents.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step and the correct number of molecules is 5e32.

But none of the options have 5e32. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Let me compute the number of moles first, using exact numbers.

Molar mass of phosgene is CCl3N.

Carbon: 12.01 g/mol.

Cl: 35.45 g/mol ×3 =106.35 g/mol.

Nitrogen: 14.01 g/mol.

Total: 12.01 +106.35 +14.01 =132.37 g/mol.

So, Molar mass =132.37 g/mol.

Mass is 1.1e8 kg →1.1e8 ×1000 g =1.1e11 g.

Moles =1.1e11 /132.37.

Compute 1.1e11 ÷132.37.

132.37 ×8.3188e8 =?

Wait, perhaps I can compute 1.1e11 ÷132.37.

1.1e11 =1.1 ×1e11.

132.37 ×8e8 =1.05896e10.

Which is 1.05896e10 grams.

But 1.1e11 is 10 times 1.05896e10.

So, 8e8 moles would give 1.05896e10 grams. But we have 1.1e11, which is 10 times more.

So, 8e8 ×10 =8e9 moles would give 1e10 ×10=1e11 grams.

Wait, but 8e9 moles ×132.37 g/mol =1e11 g.

But our target is 1.1e11 g, which is 10 times more.

So, 8e9 ×10=8e10 moles would give 1e11 ×10=1e12 g.

Wait, but our target is 1.1e11 g, which is 10 times 1e10 g.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as:

Molar mass =132.37 g/mol.

So, number of moles =1.1e11 /132.37 ≈ (1.1 /132.37) ×1e11.

1.1/132.37 ≈0.008318.

So, 0.008318 ×1e11 →8.318e8 moles.

Wait, that's the same as before.

So, number of molecules =8.318e8 ×6.022e23.

Compute 8.318 ×6.022 =50.09.

So, 50.09e31 →5.009e32 molecules.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 5.0e32, but it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial mass is 1.1e8 kg, which is 1.1e8 ×1000 =1.1e11 grams.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of molecules as (1.1e11 /132.5) ×6.022e23.

Which is the same as (1.1e11 ×6.022e23) /132.5.

Compute 1.1e11 ×6.022e23 =6.6242e34.

Divide by 132.5 →6.6242e34 /132.5 ≈5.00e32.

So, 5.00e32 molecules.

Hmm. But the options don't include 5e32. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the Molar mass of phosgene.

Phosgene is phosgene, which is CCl3N.

Carbon: 12.01 g/mol.

Chlorine: 35.45 ×3 =106.35 g/mol.

Nitrogen:14.01 g/mol.

Total:12.01 +106.35 +14.01 =132.37 g/mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the mass is 1.1e8 kg, which is 1.1e8 ×1000 =1.1e11 grams.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of molecules as (1.1e11 /132.5) ×6.022e23.

Which is equal to 1.1e11 ×6.022e23 /132.5.

Which is 6.022e34 /132.5 = approx 4.55e32.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6.022e34 /132.5 = approx 4.55e32.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me 5e32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, 6.022e34 /132.5 is 6.022e34 ÷1.325e2 → 6.022/1.325 ×1e32 → approx 4.55 ×1e32 →4.55e32 molecules.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous calculation of 5e32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier multiplication.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 8.318e8 ×6.022e23 =5.009e32.

But how is that possible when 6.022e34 ÷132.5 =4.55e32?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 6.022e34 /132.5 = ?

Let me compute 6.022e34 ÷132.5.

132.5 =132.5.

6.022e34 ÷132.5 →6.022e34 ÷1.325e2 → (6.022/1.325) ×1e32.

6.022 ÷1.325 = approx 4.55.

So, 4.55 ×1e32 =4.55e32.

Hmm, but earlier calculation gave 5e32.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier moles calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

Molar mass is 132.5.

Mass is 1.1e8 kg =1.1e8 ×1000 =1.1e11 grams.

Moles =1.1e11 /132.5 = (1.1 /132.5) ×1e11.

1.1 /132.5 = approx 0.008318.

So, 0.008318 ×1e11 =8.318e8 moles.

So, correct.

Number of molecules:8.318e8 ×6.022e23.

Calculate 8.318 ×6.022 =50.09.

So, 50.09e31 →5.009e32 molecules.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 5e32, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is J) 8e32.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of moles as 1.1e8 kg /132.5 g/mol.

Which is 1.1e8 ×1e3 /132.5 →1.1e11 /132.5 →8.318e8.

So, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial moles calculation is correct, and the number of molecules is 5e32, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the problem statement is:
