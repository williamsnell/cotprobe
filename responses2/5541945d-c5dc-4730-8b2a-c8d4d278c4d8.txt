Question:

The principal of a school is interested in estimating the average income per family of her students. She selects a random sample of students and collects information about their family income. A 95 percent confidence interval computed from this data for the mean income per family is ($35,095, $45,005). Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?

Options:

A: 95 percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095 and $45,005.
B: If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting a different interval.
C: If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting the interval ($35,095, $45,005).
D: There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.
E: 95 percent of the income per family in the school falls between $35,095 and $45,005.
F: There is a 95% probability that the median income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.
G: There is a 95% probability that the sample mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.
H: The average income per family of all the students in the school is definitely between $35,095 and $45,005.
I: There is a 95% probability that the minimum income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.
J: There is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005.

Okay, so I've got this question here about confidence intervals and their interpretation. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a school principal who wants to estimate the average income per family of her students. She took a random sample and calculated a 95% confidence interval for the mean income. The interval is ($35,095, $45,005). The question then asks which of the options correctly interprets this confidence interval.

Hmm, let me recall what a confidence interval means. I remember that a confidence interval gives us a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter, in this case, the mean income. The 95% confidence level means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true mean. But it doesn't mean that there's a 95% chance the mean is in that interval. That's a common misunderstanding.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 95% of students are in that income range. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the confidence interval is about the mean, not the individual data points. So A is incorrect.

Option B: If another sample of the same size is taken, 95% chance we'll get a different interval. No, that's not right. The confidence interval is calculated from the sample, and it's a range that likely contains the true mean. If we take another sample, the interval might be different, but it's not that we have a 95% chance of getting a different interval. The variability is due to sampling error.

Option C: Another sample gives a 95% chance of the same interval. No, again, the confidence interval is a range. The probability is about where the true mean is, not about the interval itself being repeated.

Option D: 95% probability the mean is in the interval. Wait, but I thought that's not correct. The wording is tricky. The correct interpretation is that the process is repeated many times, 95% of the time the true mean is in the interval. It's not about the probability that the mean is in the interval. Because the interval is fixed once computed; it's just that we're 95% confident it contains the true value. So D seems wrong.

Option E: 95% of income is between 35k and 45k. No, that's not the case. It's the mean, not individual data. So E is incorrect.

Option F: 95% chance the median is in the interval. No, because the confidence interval here is about the mean, not the median. So F is incorrect.

Option G: 95% chance the sample mean is in the interval. Wait, but the sample mean is the center of the interval. So this is correct. Because the confidence interval is constructed around the sample mean, and the idea is that the true mean is within this range. So G says there's a 95% chance that the sample mean is in the interval. That sounds right. Wait, let me think again. The confusion is whether the sample mean is in the interval. But the interpretation is about the true mean. So the correct statement would be that the 95% confidence interval gives a range where we are 95% confident the true mean lies. So G is correct because it's about the true mean, not the sample.

Wait, no, option G says, "There is a 95% probability that the sample mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005." But wait, isn't the sample mean the center of the interval? So the sample mean is definitely in the interval. So the statement in G is correct. Because the 95% confidence interval includes the true mean, which is the sample mean. So G is correct.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me check the options again. Option G is about the sample mean being in the interval, which is correct. Because the 95% confidence interval means that the true mean is in the interval 95% of the time. The sample mean is the best estimate, but it's not the same as the confidence interval. So option G is the correct interpretation.

Option H: The average income is definitely between 35k and 45k. That's not probabilistic. It's just the range we think the average is in, but it's not certain. So H is incorrect.

Option I: 95% chance the minimum income is between 35k and 45k. No, because again, it's about the mean, not the minimum.

Option J: 95% that all family incomes are between 35k and 45k. That's not what the interval tells us either. It tells us about the mean, not the extremes.

Wait, but now I'm a bit confused because option G says "the sample mean income per family in the school is between 35,095 and 45,005." But wait, actually, the sample mean is the center of the interval. So if the interval is between 35k and 45k, the sample mean is (35k +45k)/2 = 40k. So the sample mean is 40k. But the question is whether the sample mean is in the interval. Since the interval is the range, the sample mean is one of the points in the interval. So option G is correct.

Wait, but what's the correct interpretation of a confidence interval? The correct interpretation is that if we were to take many samples, 95% of the intervals would contain the true mean. So the correct statement is that 95% of the time, the true mean is in the interval. So option G is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the wording in G is that there's a 95% probability the sample mean is in the interval. But wait, the sample mean is fixed; it's a single value. So it's not a probability statement about the sample mean. The correct way is that the true mean is in the interval 95% of the time. So G is correct.

So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's go through each option:

A: Incorrect because it's about individual families, not the mean.

B: Incorrect because it's not about the repeated process.

C: Incorrect for the same reason.

D: Incorrect because it's not about the true mean, it's about the interval.

E: Incorrect.

F: Incorrect.

G: Correct, because the interval is constructed around the sample mean, which is the best estimate. So the 95% chance is about the true mean, not the interval.

H: Incorrect, as it's not a probability statement about the mean.

I: Incorrect.

J: Incorrect.

So the correct answer is option G.
</think>

The principal is estimating the mean income per family, and the 95% confidence interval is ($35,095, $45,005). The correct interpretation of this interval is that there's a 95% probability that the true mean income lies within this range. This is because the confidence interval is constructed to capture the true mean with 95% confidence, not that there's a 95% chance the mean is in the interval itself. 

### Analysis of Options:
- **A, B, C, E, F, I, J**: Incorrect. These options either misinterpret the confidence interval or confuse it with other statistical concepts like the median or sampling variability.
- **D**: Incorrect. While the confidence interval gives a range where the true mean is likely, it does not mean there's a 95% probability that the mean is in the interval.
- **G**: Correct. The 95% confidence interval indicates a 95% probability that the true mean is within the interval, not that the sample mean is in the interval.
- **H**: Incorrect. The confidence interval does not imply certainty about individual data points.

### Conclusion:
The correct interpretation is provided by option **G**.
