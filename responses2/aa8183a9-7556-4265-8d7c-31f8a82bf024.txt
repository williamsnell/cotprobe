Alright, I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about two mathematical statements and whether they're true or not. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question has two statements:

Statement 1: The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring.
Statement 2: Every field is an integral domain.

And the options are combinations of True and/or False for these statements.

Okay, let's start with Statement 1. I remember that in ring theory, the unity (or identity element) of a ring is an element that when multiplied by any element in the ring leaves it unchanged. Now, a subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring under the same operations. The key point is whether the unity of the subring can be different from that of the larger ring.

I recall that for the subring to have a unity, it must have an identity element. But wait, the unity of the larger ring also needs to serve as the identity for the subring. Let me think of an example. Suppose we have the ring of integers, ℤ, which has unity 1. Now, any subring of ℤ, like 2ℤ (even integers), also has unity 2. Because multiplying 2 by any even integer gives back the same even integer. So in this case, the unity is the same.

Wait, what about a ring that doesn't have a unity? Can a subring have a unity without the original ring having one? Hmm... No, I think the unity of the subring must be the same as the ring's. Because every subring must contain the multiplicative identity of the ring. For instance, if the larger ring has a unity element e, then for any element a in the subring, e*a = a. So e must act as the identity for the subring as well. Therefore, Statement 1 is True.

Wait, wait, but what if the ring doesn't have a unity? Then, the subring can't have a unity either because it's not a ring without unity. So in the question, the first statement is about a subring of a ring (which may or may not have unity). But the statement says "the unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring." So if the original ring doesn't have a unity, then the subring can't have one either. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: Every field is an integral domain.

An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero (no zero divisors). Fields are commutative rings with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. So, in a field, if you take two non-zero elements, their product must also be non-zero because the inverse exists. That means there are no zero divisors in a field. So fields are integral domains. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the field of two elements, {0,1}, where 1*1=1 ≠ 0. That's a field without zero divisors because 1 is the only non-zero element and 1*1=1≠0. So yes, it's an integral domain.

Another example: the real numbers are a field, and their product of any two non-zero real numbers is non-zero, so no zero divisors. So Statement 2 is definitely True.

Wait, but why was I confused earlier? Oh, because sometimes the concept of integral domains can vary. But in any case, the field satisfies the integral domain's definition.

So both statements are true.

Looking at the options, option G says: True, True. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: True, True.
