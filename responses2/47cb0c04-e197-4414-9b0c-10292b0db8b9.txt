Okay, so I have this question about calculating the present value of money. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking for the present value of $10 received in two years when the discount rate is 9%. Hmm, present value means figuring out how much that $10 is worth today, right?

I remember that present value is calculated using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. Here, FV is the future value, which is $10. The discount rate, r, is 9%, so 0.09 as a decimal. And n is the number of periods, which is two years.

Plugging these numbers into the formula: PV = 10 / (1 + 0.09)^2. Let's calculate the denominator first. 1.09 squared is 1.1881. So, PV is 10 divided by 1.1881. Doing the division, 10 / 1.1881 equals approximately 8.42. Wait, let me check that calculation again. 1.1881 times 8 is about 9.5048, which is less than 10. 1.1881 times 8.42 is approximately 10. So yes, 8.42 is correct.

Looking at the options, option B is $8.42. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up present and future values. Oh wait, no, the question clearly says present value, so 8.42 is correct. So the answer should be B.

The present value of $10 received in two years with a 9% discount rate is calculated as:

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n  
PV = 10 / (1.09)^2  
PV = 10 / 1.1881 ≈ 8.42  

Answer: B
