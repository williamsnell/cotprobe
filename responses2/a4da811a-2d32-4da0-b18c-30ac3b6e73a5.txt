Question:

A potato peeling solution was found to be 2.56 M inNaOH (formula weight = 40.0 g/mole) at the end of the day. To operate, the solution must be at least 10 %NaOHby weight (100 gNaOHper 1000 g of solution) . What weight percent corresponds to 2.56 M? The density of a 2.56 M solution of NaOHis about 1.10 g/ml.

F: 10 % by weight
G: 14.5 % by weight
H: 12 % by weight
I: 7.7 % by weight

Okay, so I have this problem about a potato peeling solution, and I need to find out what weight percent of NaOH corresponds to a 2.56 M solution. The problem states that the solution needs to be at least 10% NaOH by weight. The density is given as 1.10 g/ml, and the molarity is 2.56 M. 

Hmm, let me think. Molarity is moles per liter, so 2.56 M means there are 2.56 moles of NaOH per liter of solution. But I need to find the weight percent of NaOH in the solution. 

Wait, weight percent is grams of solute per 100 grams of solution. So, I need to find how many grams of NaOH are in the solution and then relate that to the total solution mass.

The formula for weight percent is (grams of solute / grams of solution) * 100%. 

But I don't know the grams of solution yet. Oh wait, I can find the mass of the solution using the density. Oh right, because density is grams per milliliter.

First, let me calculate the mass of the solution. Since the density is 1.10 g/ml, each liter is 1000 ml. So, 1.10 g/ml * 1000 ml = 1100 grams per liter. So, a 2.56 M solution has 2.56 moles of NaOH per liter. 

Each mole of NaOH is 40 grams (since the formula weight is 40.0 g/mol). So, moles = 2.56 mol, so mass of NaOH is 2.56 * 40 = 102.4 grams.

So, in 1 liter of solution (1100 grams), there's 102.4 grams of NaOH. 

Now, to find the weight percent, I need the grams of solute (NaOH) over the total solution mass, multiplied by 100%. 

So, weight percent = (102.4 g / 1100 g) * 100%. Let me calculate that.

102.4 divided by 1100. Let me compute that: 102.4 / 1100. Let's see, 102.4 / 1100 = 0.09309 approximately. Multiply by 100 gives 9.309%, which is about 9.31%.

Looking at the options, option J is 9.3%. So, that would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Molarity (M) = 2.56 mol/L. Molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol. 

So, moles of NaOH in 1 L = 2.56.

Mass of NaOH = 2.56 * 40 = 102.4 grams. 

Density is 1.10 g/ml, so 1 L (1000 ml) has 1.10 * 1000 = 1100 grams of solution.

So, weight percent = (102.4 / 1100) * 100 = (approx 0.0931) * 100 = 9.31%. So yes, 9.3% is correct. 

Looking at the options, option J is 9.3% by weight. So, the answer should be J.

To determine the weight percent of NaOH in a 2.56 M solution with a density of 1.10 g/mL, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the mass of NaOH in 1 liter of solution**:  
   - Molarity (M) = 2.56 mol/L.  
   - Moles of NaOH in 1 L = 2.56 mol.  
   - Molar mass of NaOH = 40.0 g/mol.  
   - Mass of NaOH = 2.56 mol × 40.0 g/mol = 102.4 g.

2. **Calculate the mass of the solution**:  
   - Density = 1.10 g/mL.  
   - Volume = 1 L = 1000 mL.  
   - Mass of solution = 1.10 g/mL × 1000 mL = 1100 g.

3. **Calculate the weight percent of NaOH**:  
   - Weight percent = (mass of NaOH / mass of solution) × 100%.  
   - Weight percent = (102.4 g / 1100 g) × 100% ≈ 9.31%.

4. **Compare with the options**:  
   - The calculated weight percent is approximately 9.31%, which matches option J (9.3 % by weight).
