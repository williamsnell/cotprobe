Okay, so I need to figure out which option A through J correctly answers this multiple-choice question about Pigou and his contribution to the analysis of economic policy. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about Pigou and his impact on monetary policy. It says that Pigou contributed to the analysis of the effects of monetary policy. The options are A to J, each making a different claim about his work.

First, I should recall what I know about Pigou's theories. I remember that James D. shifts Pigou's work to the right or left, so he was known for his contributions to economics, especially in the area of monetary policy and fiscal policy.

Looking at the options, I need to find the correct one. 

Option D says Pigou provided an additional explanation of how monetary policy affects the economy, highlighting the Pigou effect. The Pigou effect refers to the increase in consumption and economic recovery when the money supply increases, independent of interest rates. That rings a bell. I think Pigou did argue about the relationship between money supply and spending, which is related to the Pigou effect.

Another point: Pigou's theory was influential, but I'm trying to remember if he opposed mainstream economic theory. I think he did argue against the classical view, which was that expansionary policies would just lead to higher prices. Pigou believed that the economy would recover because the money supply increases stimulate spending, increasing demand, leading to higher production, which in turn boosts income, creating more demand. So he did emphasize the impact of expansionary fiscal policies beyond just increasing prices.

Looking at the options, option E says Pigou claimed that the true impact of monetary policy is found in regulating wage levels. That doesn't sound right because Pigou focused more on the money supply's effect on spending, not directly on wages. So E is likely incorrect.

Option D seems more accurate because it's about the Pigou effect, which is when the money supply increases leads to higher spending, thus stimulating the economy. 

So, the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D.

**Explanation:**
Pigou's contribution to monetary policy analysis includes the Pigou effect, which highlights how an increase in the money supply can stimulate economic recovery through increased spending, independent of interest rates. This is a key concept in Pigou's theories, emphasizing the direct impact of the money supply on economic activity beyond traditional interest rate influences.
