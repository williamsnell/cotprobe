Okay, so I have this question about cash flows and accounting methods. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says that Zokro is a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization that uses the indirect method to prepare its statement of cash flows. They're asking which item needs to be added back to the change in net assets when determining the net cash provided (used) by operating activities. The options are A through J, each with a different accounting transaction.

Hmm, I remember that when using the indirect method, adjustments are made to the net income to reconcile it with the actual changes in the balance sheet. The basic idea is that the net income might not reflect the actual cash flow because it doesn't consider non-cash expenses or changes in assets and liabilities.

So the statement of cash flows under the indirect method starts with the net income and adds back non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization. But wait, that's for the operating section. Then, for changes in operating assets and liabilities, you subtract them because they affect cash differently.

Wait, no, I think the process is: Start with net income. Then add back non-cash expenses (like depreciation) because they don't affect cash. Then adjust for changes in current assets and liabilities. For example, if accounts receivable increases, that's a use of cash, so you subtract it. If accounts payable increases, that's a source of cash, so you add it.

Wait, no, I might be getting it backward. Let me think: When an asset increases, it's a use of cash, so you need to subtract it. When a liability increases, it's a source of cash, so you add it. Similarly, if current assets increase, that's a source of cash, so you add it. But wait, no: when you have an increase in current assets, like accounts receivable, that's a use, so you subtract it. Similarly, an increase in accounts payable (which is a liability) would indicate that the company has paid some money, so that's a use of cash, which would require adding back because the expense was already recorded.

So for the operating activities section, the change in net assets (i.e., the net income adjustment) is adjusted by changes in current assets and liabilities. The formula is:

Net cash provided by operating activities = Net income + non-cash expenses + decreases in current assets - increases in current assets + increases in current liabilities - decreases in current liabilities.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: The net change in net assets (current assets - current liabilities) is added to the net income to get the operating cash flow.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think of it as:

Change in net assets = Ending net assets - Beginning net assets.

But in the indirect method, you start with net income, add back non-cash expenses (like depreciation), then adjust for changes in current assets and liabilities.

So, the formula is:

Operating cash flow = Net income + non-cash expenses (depreciation, interest, etc.) - increase in current assets + increase in current liabilities.

Wait, I might be getting mixed up. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Start with net income.
2. Add back non-cash expenses (like depreciation) because they weren't expensed in the income statement.
3. Adjust for changes in current assets: if current assets increase, subtract; if they decrease, add.
4. Adjust for changes in current liabilities: if current liabilities increase, add; if decrease, subtract.

So, for example, if accounts receivable increases, that's a use of cash, so you subtract that amount. If accounts payable increases, that's a source of cash (because the company paid, so that's a source), so you add it.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose a company has an accounts receivable increase of $5,000. That means they have more money on hand, so that's a use of cash. Therefore, in the operating cash flow calculation, you would subtract $5,000. Alternatively, in the change in net assets, accounts receivable is ending at $100k, beginning at $80k. So change is +20k. To get the net change, you add this +20k to net income. But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, let's think of the overall formula. The operating cash flow is calculated as:

Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Non-cash Expenses + Decrease in Assets - Increase in Assets + Increase in Liabilities - Decrease in Liabilities.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Another way: The change in net assets is (Ending Net Assets - Beginning Net Assets). The net assets section includes current assets and current liabilities. So, the change in net assets would be:

Change in Net Assets = (Ending Current Assets - Ending Current Liabilities) - (Beginning Current Assets - Beginning Current Liabilities).

But in the operating section, the cash flow is calculated by starting with net income and adjusting for non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.

So, the formula is:

Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Non-cash Expenses (like depreciation) + Decrease in Assets (current assets) - Increase in Assets (current assets) + Increase in Liabilities (current) - Decrease in Liabilities.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think of the cash flow statement as:

Net Income (after taxes) plus non-cash expenses (like depreciation) plus changes in non-cash items (like accounts receivable, etc.) equals operating cash flow.

Alternatively, here's a more straightforward approach: When using the indirect method, to calculate operating cash flow, you take net income and add back non-cash expenses (like depreciation) because they don't affect cash. Then, for changes in current assets and liabilities, you adjust. For example, if current assets increase, that means the company spent more cash, so you subtract that increase from the operating cash flow. If current assets decrease, you add that decrease.

So, for example, an increase in accounts receivable would mean more cash was collected, so that's a source of cash. So that would be subtracted from operating cash flow.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me take a concrete example.

Suppose net income is $100,000. Depreciation is $20,000. So, add back depreciation: 100,000 +20,000 = 120,000.

Now, suppose accounts receivable increased by $10,000. That means the net cash effect is that the company has more cash in its account, so this is a use of cash. So, in the operating cash flow calculation, you subtract this increase.

So, operating cash flow would be 120,000 -10,000 = 110,000.

Wait, but wait. The change in net assets is (Ending - Beginning). Let's say net assets increased by $10k. So, operating cash flow is net income + non-cash + change in assets.

In the example, the change in net assets is a +10k (since net assets increased by 10k). So, 100,000 +20,000 +10,000 = 130,000. But the previous calculation gave 110,000. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that when calculating the operating cash flow via the indirect method, you start with net income, add back non-cash expenses, then adjust for changes in current assets and liabilities.

So, the formula is:

Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Non-cash Expenses + (Decrease in Assets) - (Increase in Assets) + (Increase in Liabilities) - (Decrease in Liabilities).

Wait, I'm not sure. Another way: the operating cash flow is calculated as net income plus non-cash expenses plus the changes in current assets and liabilities.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

Change in Net Assets = (Ending Current Assets - Ending Current Liabilities) - (Beginning Current Assets - Beginning Current Liabilities)

This change plus net income (adjusted for non-cash items) equals the operating cash flow.

Wait, so maybe:

Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Non-cash Expenses + (Ending Net Assets - Beginning Net Assets)

Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Non-cash Expenses + (Ending Current Assets - Beginning Current Assets) + (Ending Current Liabilities - Beginning Current Liabilities)

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the cash flow from operations is calculated by adding back non-cash expenses, and then adjusting for changes in current assets and liabilities.

So, for example:

If accounts receivable increases by $5,000 (so, more cash received), that's a use of cash, so you subtract $5,000. If accounts payable increases by $3,000 (meaning you settled a debt, so cash is freed up), you add $3,000.

Similarly, if accounts receivable decreases, you add that amount. If accounts payable decreases, you subtract that.

Wait, I think that's correct.

So, in the question, the options are:

A: Sale of equipment.

B: Depreciation.

C: Increase in accounts payable.

D: Increase in accounts receivable.

E: Decrease in accounts payable.

F: Donation income.

G: Purchase of inventory.

H: Payment on long-term debt.

I: Payment on long-term debt.

J: Purchase of equipment.

The question is, which item must be added back to the change in net assets.

So, for each option, which of them is a non-cash expense that needs to be added back.

Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it's added back.

Increase in accounts payable: accounts payable is a liability. If it increases, that means the company has paid more, so it's a use of cash, so you add that amount. So for example, if accounts payable increases by $10k, that's a $10k addition to operating cash flow.

Increase in accounts receivable: this is a current asset increase. So, it's a use of cash, so you subtract that from the operating cash flow.

So, the options are:

Option C: Increase in accounts payable.

So, the correct answer would be C.
</think>

To determine which item must be added back to the change in net assets when calculating net cash provided by operating activities using the indirect method, we need to consider non-cash expenses and changes in current assets and liabilities. Non-cash expenses like depreciation are added back to net income, while increases in current assets (e.g., accounts receivable) are subtracted because they represent a use of cash, and decreases in current assets are added because they represent a source of cash. Similarly, increases in current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable) are added, and decreases in current liabilities are subtracted.

- **Option A: Sale of equipment**  
  This is a cash inflow and does not affect net assets changes, so it is not added back.

- **Option B: Depreciation**  
  Depreciation is a non-cash expense and must be added back to net income.

- **Option C: Increase in accounts payable**  
  An increase in accounts payable represents a use of cash, so it must be added back.

- **Option D: Increase in accounts receivable**  
  An increase in accounts receivable represents a use of cash, so it must be subtracted.

- **Option E: Decrease in accounts payable**  
  A decrease in accounts payable represents a source of cash, so it must be added back.

- **Option F: Donation income**  
  Donation income is a cash inflow and does not affect net assets changes, so it is not added back.

- **Option G: Purchase of inventory**  
  This is a cash outflow and does not affect net assets changes, so it is not added back.

- **Option H: Payment on long-term debt**  
  This is a cash outflow and does not affect net assets changes, so it is not added back.

- **Option I: Payment on long-term debt**  
  This is a cash outflow and does not affect net assets changes, so it is not added back.

- **Option J: Purchase of equipment**  
  This is a cash outflow and does not affect net assets changes, so it is not added back.

From the analysis, the correct item to add back is **Option C: Increase in accounts payable**.
