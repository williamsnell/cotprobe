Okay, so I've got this question about the Truth-In-Lending regulations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it carefully. The question is about what a retailer must indicate on a sales contract as the annual interest rate when they charge 1.5% interest per month. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

Alright, so first, I remember that interest rates can be expressed in different ways. I think the key here is to convert the monthly rate to an annual rate. Oh wait, right, because the interest per month is 1.5%, so over 12 months, that should add up to the annual rate.

Let me calculate that. If it's 1.5% per month, then:

1.5% per month Ã— 12 months = 18% per year.

So that would be option D, right? But wait, I need to make sure I'm not confusing simple interest with something else, but in this case, since it's a monthly rate, multiplying by 12 makes sense.

Wait, but sometimes, in some contexts, interest rates are compounded, but I don't think that applies here because it's just simple interest being charged per month. The question doesn't mention anything about compounding, so it's just a flat 1.5% each month.

Let me double-check. 1.5% times 12 is 18%, which is option D. Yeah, that seems right. So the annual interest rate is 18%.
</think>

The correct answer is **D: 18%**, as this is the annual rate derived by multiplying the monthly rate of 1.5% by 12 months.

Answer: D
