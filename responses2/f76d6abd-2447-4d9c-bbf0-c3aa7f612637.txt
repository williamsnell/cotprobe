Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about group theory. Let's see what it's about. The question has two statements, 1 and 2, and we need to figure out if they're true or false. The options are combinations of True/False and some 'Undetermined' cases.

Let me read the statements again.

Statement 1 says: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian. Hmm, I remember that free abelian groups are also called free modules over the integers. They have the property that every subgroup is also free. Wait, but wait, does this apply when the original group is finitely generated? I think yes, because a free abelian group being finitely generated is the same as being a finitely generated free abelian group.

So Statement 1 should be true. Because any subgroup of a free abelian group is free, regardless of whether it's finitely generated or not. But wait, the group is given as finitely generated. Does that affect anything? No, because even if it's not finitely generated, the statement says K is a subgroup of a finitely generated one, which is a free abelian group. So the statement holds: K is free abelian.

Statement 2: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G/K is free abelian. Wait, G is the original group, and K is a subgroup. So G/K is the quotient group. I'm trying to recall what this is. The quotient of a free abelian group by a subgroup is not necessarily free. For example, take G as ℤ², which is free abelian. Let K be generated by (1,1). Then G/K would be ℤ/(1,1)Z, which is the same as ℤ, but wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps another example. Let G be ℤ², generated by e1 and e2. Let K be generated by e1 + e2. Then G/K would consist of the cosets e1, e2, and the coset (e1+e2). The group operation would have to be defined, but since K is a subgroup, G/K should be abelian. However, is it free abelian? Wait, G/K in this case is ℤ² / ⟨e1 + e2⟩. The quotient would be ℤ × ℤ modulo the subgroup generated by (1,1). The quotient group ℤ² / ⟨(1,1)⟩ is isomorphic to ℤ, right? Because the quotient would have one generator, so it's free abelian. Wait, but wait, wait, another example: suppose G is ℤ², K is generated by (1,0) and (0,1), which is the entire group. Then G/K is trivial, which is free abelian. But that's a trivial case. What if K is generated by (2,0)? Then G/K would be ℤ/(2ℤ) × ℤ, which is ℤ × ℤ₂. But ℤ₂ is not free abelian because it's torsion. So in this case, G/K is not free abelian. Because it's ℤ × ℤ₂, which isn't free. So that shows that Statement 2 is false because it's not always true.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me check that example again. G is ℤ², K is generated by (2,0). Then G/K would have elements like (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), etc.? No, wait, no. Wait, G is generated by e1 and e2, which can be considered as (1,0) and (0,1). K is generated by (2,0), so the elements of K are multiples of (2,0). The cosets would be like (a,b) + K. But when you add (2,0), you get multiples of 2 in the first coordinate. So when you take G/K, each coset would have the form (a mod 2, b). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the quotient G/K would have elements (a + 2ℤ, b + 0ℤ) since K is generated by (2,0). So G/K is isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ₂, which is not free abelian because ℤ₂ is not free. So this would mean that Statement 2 is false. Because G/K is not necessarily free abelian.

Wait, but wait! Wait, but Statement 2 says that if K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G/K is free abelian. But in my example, K is a subgroup, G is finitely generated free abelian, and G/K is not free abelian. So Statement 2 is false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options:

Options are, for each statement, whether it's true or false. So:

Statement 1: True
Statement 2: False

Now, looking at the options:

Option E is False, False. Because statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false. So E: False, False.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 1 is true, but wait, what about the condition that the group is finitely generated? Because Statement 1 says "If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian." Since K is a subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, which is itself a free abelian group, then K must be free abelian. So yes, Statement 1 is true.

So the options are:

A: False, True → No
B: False, Undetermined → No
C: True, False → Yes
D: Both undetermined → No
E: False, False → No
F: Undetermined, True → No
G: True, Undetermined → No
H: Statement 1 is undetermined, Statement 2 is true → No, since 1 is true
I: True, True → No
J: False, False → Yes

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct option is E: False, False.

**Explanation:**
- **Statement 1** is true because any subgroup of a free abelian group is free, regardless of whether the group is finitely generated or not.
- **Statement 2** is false because the quotient group G/K can be non-free abelian. For example, when K is a non-free subgroup of a free abelian group, like generated by (2,0) in ℤ², G/K is ℤ × ℤ₂, which is not free.

Thus, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. The correct answer is E.
