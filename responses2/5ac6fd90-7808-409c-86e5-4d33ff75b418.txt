Okay, so I've got this question about planarians and how they change their body shape. Hmm, I remember planarians are those little organisms, right? They're from the familyplanaridae. Wait, planarians have a lot of gills, like how jellyfish do, but maybe they have more. I think their gills are adapted to make the body curve. Oh yeah, I remember something about the gills being flexible and allowing the body to change shape.

Looking at the options, option A is about extending and retracting spines. I'm not sure about this one. I think spines are more like in finches or other animals, maybe. Planarians might not have spines as much.

Option B talks about cilia on the underside. Cilia are little hair-like structures that move by beating. But I don't recall planarians having cilia. They have gills, which are adapted for movement, not cilia. So probably not B.

Option C suggests mucus layer. Mucus is something I associate more with fungi, not planarians. They have gills, not a mucus layer. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says absorbing water and expanding. Planarians have gills that trap water, but when they need to change shape, maybe they expand the gills to make the body curve. But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, maybe they use the gills to change shape.

Option E is about muscles changing shape. Planarians have muscles that allow them to bend and change shape, but I'm not sure if it's through muscles or just their gills. The question is about the mechanism.

Option F: Shifting body fluids. I don't think that's their main method. They use gills, not just shifting fluids.

Option G: Changing skin thickness. I don't recall planarians having a skin that changes thickness. They have gills on the body, which might be more about shape than skin structure.

Option H: Rapid cell division. That sounds more like metazoa, like fish or amphibians. Planarians don't have that, so H is probably wrong.

Option I: Inflating air sacs. Air sacs are part of some organisms, like diatoms and sponges. Planarians don't have that feature.

Option J: Altering genetic structure. Planarians are genetically stable; their development is controlled, but I don't think they change their overall structure. So J seems unlikely.

Wait, going back. Planarians are known for their gills. These gills allow them to change shape by retracting and extending them. So when they need to bend, they retract the gills, and when they straighten, they extend them. This makes the body curve. So option A says that, but wait, the last character must be the letter chosen. The options are letters, so the answer is one of them, and the last letter is the letter, I think. Or wait, the question says "the planarian changes its body shape." So the answer is option A, as it explains the movement of spines, but wait, no, earlier I thought gills allow for shape change.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between gills and spines. Planarian gills are long and flexible, allowing the body to curve. So the correct mechanism would be retraction and extension of the gills. So option A says "By extending and retracting spines along its body." But I thought planarians use gills, not spines. So maybe I was wrong about that.

Wait, but looking again, the question says "Explain how the planarian changes its body shape." So I need to find the mechanism. Planarians use gills for movement, which change the shape by retracting and extending the gills. So the correct answer should be about gills, not spines. But none of the options directly state that. The options are A through J, so perhaps option A is about spines. Let me reevaluate.

Looking at the options again:

A: By extending and retracting spines along its body.

B: Through the use of cilia on its underside for movement and shape alteration.

C: By secreting a mucus layer to change body contours.

D: By absorbing water and expanding.

E: By coordinated contraction and relaxation of circular, longitudinal, and dorsoventral muscles, the body shape of a planarian can be varied.

F: By shifting the distribution of body fluids to different segments.

G: By changing the thickness of its skin.

H: By rapid cell division and growth in specific body regions.

I: By inflating air sacs within its body.

J: By altering its genetic structure.

So, which of these explains body shape change. I thought that planarians use gills, but I might be mistaken. Let me think: Some planarians, like the splanulates, have gills which they retract to curve. Others, like the planarid planarians, have gills that help them change their body shape. So the mechanism is movement of gills, which would be option A if it's about spines, but I thought they use gills. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to another structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the structures. Planarids have gills, which are adapted for movement. So the correct answer should involve the gills moving, which is extending and retracting. But in the options, option A is about spines. So if the question is about spines, then it's about spines, but I thought planarians use gills, not spines.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the mechanism. Maybe the question is referring to another structure. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the options. Let me think about the options again.

Option E says they change shape by contracting and relaxing muscles. Planarids have gills that are used for movement. So maybe they don't change shape through muscles; that's more about gills. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but no, E refers to muscles changing shape, which I think is a different process. Planarids don't use muscles for body shape change; they use gills.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Planarids are not metazoans, but metazoans include planarians. Wait no, metazoans are metazoans, which are fish, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates. Planarid planarians are definitely metazoan.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the functions. Let me think about the process. Planarian gills allow for bending and curving of the body. So the movement is by the gills, which retract and extend. So the correct process is retraction and extension of the gills. But looking at the options, option A talks about spines. So perhaps the correct answer is not A.

Wait, another thought: planarian gills are typically called "gill," but the question's option A says "spines." Maybe the answer is option A, but I'm not sure because I thought the structure was gills. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to another adaptation.

Wait, maybe the answer is option E, but that doesn't make sense because the muscles wouldn't change shape much. Alternatively, perhaps the movement is through the act of retracting and extending the gills, which are flexible structures. So the answer might be A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the mechanism. So the correct answer would involve either the gills (retracted and extended) or the muscles (option E). Planarids use gills, so the mechanism is movement of gills. So option A is about spines, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the gills being extended and retracted, which is option A.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of each option's process.

Option A: Extending and retracting spines. I'm not sure; planarians don't have spines.

Option B: Cilia on underside. No, planarians have gills.

Option C: Mucus layer. No, planarians don't have mucus.

Option D: Water absorption and expanding. Hmm, planarids have gills, which trap water. So maybe they expand the gills to change shape, but this is not about expanding into air, but about shape via gills. Or perhaps the gills are just on the body, and expanding them (like retracting) allows the body to curve.

Option E: muscles. Planarids have gills, not muscles. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: Shifting body fluids. Not relevant.

Option G: Skin thickness. Not relevant.

Option H: Rapid cell division. No.

Option I: Inflating air sacs. No.

Option J: Genetic change. No.

So the only options that make sense are A, D, or E. Since E is about muscles, which don't play a role here, and D is about expanding water, which is part of gills. So perhaps D is D: By absorbing water and expanding.

Wait, but the question is about body shape. So the gills would be retracting and extending to curve. So the movement of the gills would explain body shape change. But none of the options directly state that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A. Let me think: perhaps the question refers to the act of the gills, which are made of spines? No, planarian gills are called gills, not spines. So perhaps the answer is not A.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because perhaps the question is talking about another adaptation. Maybe the question is using 'spines' as a metaphor for gills. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question says "changes its body shape." Planarian gills help with that.

So the mechanism is retraction and extension of the gills. But the answer options don't mention gills. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps option A is correct, because it's about spines, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, as the question might have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure. Since the question is a bit confusing, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but that's about muscles. No, muscles don't change shape much. So I'm back to A being the best option, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I don't see how.

Wait, another angle: Planarian gills are flexible, made of water-repellent material, which allow them to bend and curve the body. So the movement is the retraction and extension of the gills. But the options don't mention gills. So perhaps the answer is E, but that's about muscles. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite confusion. So I'll go with that.

The question asks about the mechanism by which planarians change their body shape. Planarians are known for their gills, which are adapted for movement, allowing them to bend and curve their bodies. These gills are typically referred to as "gills" in English, but in some contexts, they may be called "spines" or "gill structures." Among the given options, the most relevant explanation is the movement of these gills, which allows the body to change shape.

- **Option A**: "By extending and retracting spines along its body." This is incorrect because planarians do not have spines; their gills are the adapted structures responsible for body shape change.
- **Option B**: "Through the use of cilia on its underside for movement and shape alteration." Incorrect, as planarians have gills, not cilia.
- **Option C**: "By secreting a mucus layer to change body contours." Incorrect, as planarians do not rely on mucus or gills for contour changes.
- **Option D**: "By absorbing water and expanding." While planarian gills trap water, this process is not directly related to expanding into air but to retracting the gills to curve the body.
- **Option E**: "By coordinating contraction and relaxation of circular, longitudinal, and dorsoventral muscles, the body shape of a planarian can be varied." Incorrect, as planarians do not use muscles for body shape change; they rely on gills.
- **Option F**: "By shifting the distribution of body fluids to different segments." Incorrect, as this is unrelated to planarian gills.
- **Option G**: "By changing the thickness of its skin." Incorrect, as planarians do not have a skin structure that changes thickness.
- **Option H**: "By rapid cell division and growth in specific body regions." Incorrect, as planarians are genetically stable and do not undergo rapid cell division.
- **Option I**: "By inflating air sacs within its body." Incorrect, as this is unrelated to planarian gills.
- **Option J**: "By altering its genetic structure." Incorrect, as planarians have stable genetic structures.

After careful consideration, the best explanation is that planarians change their body shape through the movement of their gills, which are referred to as spines, allowing them to bend and curve. However, since the option explicitly mentions "spines," there may be confusion with the terminology. Given the options, **Option A** is the most appropriate despite the slight misnomer.
