Okay, so I've got this question about mirrors. Hmm, mirrors can be a bit tricky, but let's try to figure this out step by step. The question says that someone wants to view their face as reflected from a concave mirror. The mirror is 20 cm from the face, and they want the image to be 40 cm from the mirror. I need to find the radius of curvature, the focal length, and the magnification. Then choose the right option from A to J.

Wait, concave mirrors are also called converging mirrors. Oh right, concave mirrors have a focal length that's positive, and they can form real images when the object is within the focal length. But wait, the mirror here is concave, so it's a converging mirror. So for a real image, the object has to be within the focal length.

Let me think about the setup. The person's face is the object, and the mirror is the mirror. The distance between the object (face) and the mirror is 20 cm. The image is formed 40 cm from the mirror. So the total distance from the object to the image is 20 + 40 = 60 cm. Wait, wait, no. Because the object is on one side of the mirror, and the image is on the other side. So the distance from the object (person's face) to the mirror is 20 cm, and the image is 40 cm beyond the mirror. So the distance between the object and the image would be 20 + 40 = 60 cm. Oh wait, no, wait. When you have a real image from a concave mirror, the object is on one side, and the image is on the other side but behind the mirror. So the distance between them is 20 + 40 = 60 cm.

But wait, I think the mirror's focal length is important here. The mirror equation should apply. The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, di is the image distance. But wait, I need to remember the signs. For a concave mirror, the focal length is positive. The object distance (do) is positive if the object is in front of the mirror, and negative if behind. Wait, no, no, wait. The sign convention is that for mirrors, the object distance (do) is positive if the object is in front of the mirror, and negative if behind. So, wait: if the object is in front of the mirror (distance from object to mirror is 20 cm), then do is positive 20 cm. The image distance (di) would be negative because the image is in front of the mirror? Or wait, wait. No: wait, in the standard sign convention, the image is on the opposite side of the mirror from the object if it's a real image. So for a real image formed by a concave mirror, the image is on the same side as the incoming light, so the image is in front of the mirror. Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The object is in front of the mirror (distance do = 20 cm). The image is formed on the same side as the object. So if the mirror is concave, the image is virtual and on the same side (behind the mirror, but wait, no). Wait, no. For a concave mirror, the image can be real or virtual, depending on where the object is. When the object is within the focal length, the image is virtual and upright, behind the mirror. When the object is beyond the focal length, the image is real and inverted, but it's located between the mirror and the focal point.

Wait, so if the object is 20 cm in front of the mirror, and the image is 40 cm behind the mirror, then what does that mean? Let me think: the object is 20 cm in front of the mirror. The image is 40 cm behind the mirror. So the distance from the object to the image is 20 + 40 = 60 cm. But wait, for mirrors, the image distance is measured from the mirror. So for the object distance, do, it's 20 cm, since the object is in front. The image distance, di, is -40 cm. Wait, no, wait: the image is on the same side as the object for a virtual image. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the image is formed 40 cm behind the mirror. So from the mirror, the image is 40 cm beyond. So for the mirror equation, the object distance (do) is positive 20 cm. The image distance (di) is negative because the image is on the opposite side of the mirror from where the light comes, so di is negative.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. The sign conventions are: when the object is on the same side as the incoming light (the object is in front of the mirror), do is positive. The image is on the opposite side (behind the mirror) if it's a virtual image. So di is negative because the image is in the opposite direction. So in this case, the object is 20 cm in front, so do=20 cm. The image is 40 cm behind the mirror, so di = -40 cm.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if the image is 40 cm behind the mirror, then from the mirror, the image is 40 cm. So if the mirror is at 0 cm, the object is at 20 cm, the image is at -40 cm? That doesn't make sense because the image is in the same direction as the object. No, wait, maybe I have the sign wrong. Wait, I'm getting really confused. Let me clarify.

The standard sign convention is: the object is on the same side as the incoming light. For a mirror, the object is in front of it, so do is positive. The image is on the opposite side of the mirror relative to the object if it's a virtual image. So if the object is in front (do positive), a virtual image would be on the same side (behind the mirror), so di would be positive when the image is on the same side as the object. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Imagine standing in front of a mirror (the object is in front). The image is on your side (behind the mirror). So the image distance is positive because it's on the same side as the object.

Wait, no, wait. No, I'm getting this wrong. The image formed by a concave mirror is virtual, so it's formed on the side opposite to where the object is. So if the object is in front of the mirror, the image is behind the mirror. Wait, no. Wait, no, I'm getting it wrong. Let me think of a real image. For a real image, it's formed on the opposite side of the mirror from the object. So, if the object is in front of the mirror, the real image is behind the mirror. So, in terms of signs, do is positive (object in front), di is negative (image behind mirror, which is the same side as where the image is located from the mirror).

Wait, no. Let me think. In the standard sign convention for mirrors, the object is on the same side as the incoming light. So for a concave mirror, if the object is in front (do positive), then the image is behind the mirror (di negative). Because the image is on the opposite side from where the light is coming. So in this problem, the image is 40 cm behind the mirror. So di is negative 40 cm.

Wait, but wait, the question is, the image is 40 cm from the mirror. So the image is 40 cm away from the mirror, but on the same side as the person's face. Because the mirror is behind the face. Wait, no. Wait, the person's face is 20 cm from the mirror. So if the face is in front of the mirror, the mirror is 20 cm behind. Wait, no. Wait, if the mirror is 20 cm from the face, the face is in front of the mirror, so the mirror is 20 cm away. The image is 40 cm from the mirror, but where? The image is 40 cm behind the mirror? Because the image is on the same side as the mirror relative to the object. Wait, this is getting really confusing. Maybe I should draw a diagram in my mind.

Imagine the mirror is at position 0. The face is at position 20 cm (in front of the mirror). The image is 40 cm from the mirror. So the image is at position -40 cm (behind the mirror). So do is 20 cm (object in front), di is -40 cm (image behind the mirror). Wait, no. Because if the image is 40 cm from the mirror on the same side as the face, it's in front of the mirror, not behind. Wait, no, the image must be on the opposite side from the object if it's a virtual image. So if the object is in front (do = +20 cm), the image is virtual and on the same side as the object (behind the mirror): so di is positive 40 cm.

Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Let me refer to the mirror equation formula. For a concave mirror, if the object is placed within the focal length, the image is virtual, upright, and located on the same side as the object. So if the object is in front of the mirror (do is positive), the image is behind the mirror (di would be positive? Or negative?) Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, in the standard sign convention, the image distance (di) is positive if the image is on the same side as the object, and negative if it's on the opposite side. So for a real image (which concave mirrors can produce when the object is within the focal length), di is positive. So, in this case, if the object is in front (do positive), the image is behind the mirror (so di is positive 40 cm). But wait, the image is 40 cm from the mirror behind it. So di is negative 40 cm? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it this way: if the mirror is at position 0, the face is at +20 cm. The image is 40 cm from the mirror in the same direction as the face. So it's at position -40 cm (behind the mirror). So the object is at +20, the image at -40. So for the mirror equation:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Do is 20 cm, di is -40 cm.

Wait, but wait, is the image at -40 cm? No, because if the image is 40 cm behind the mirror, from the mirror's perspective, but from the object's perspective (the person's face), the image is on the same side as the mirror. So for the object, the image is on the same side as the mirror, but the mirror is at 20 cm. So the image is at 20 cm + 40 cm = 60 cm from the object. Wait, but that would make the image distance di positive 40 cm. Wait, I'm getting myself in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mirror equation with signs, and then solve for f. Then, once I have f, I can find the magnification (m) using m = -di/do.

Wait, let's try that approach. So, do = 20 cm, di = -40 cm. Because the image is behind the mirror, so di is negative.

So, 1/f = 1/20 + 1/(-40) = 1/20 - 1/40 = (2-1)/40 = 1/40 cm^-1.

So f = 40 cm. Wait, but wait, a concave mirror can't have a focal length of 40 cm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, concave mirrors can have positive focal lengths. Wait, 40 cm is positive, which is correct for a concave mirror.

Wait but wait, another approach: if the image is real and formed 40 cm behind the mirror, then do is 20 cm, di is -40 cm. So 1/f = 1/20 + 1/(-40) = (2/40) - (1/40) = 1/40 cm^-1. So f =40 cm.

Wait, but wait, the focal length is 40 cm. But a concave mirror's focal length should be positive. So that's correct. Now, let's compute the magnification. m = - (di)/do. So di is -40, do is 20. So m = - (-40)/20 = 40/20 = 2. So the magnification is 2.

Wait, but wait. Now, what's the radius of curvature? For a mirror, the radius of curvature is twice the focal length. So R = 2f. So in this case, R = 80 cm.

Wait, let me check the options. Let's see. Looking at option B: radius 80 cm, focal 20 cm, which would make the focal length 20 cm. Wait, but according to our calculation, f is 40 cm. So option B's f is 20 cm, but that's not correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, did I get the image distance correct? Because if the image is 40 cm from the mirror, but the object is 20 cm from the mirror, perhaps the image distance is -40 cm. Wait, but that would make the calculation:

1/f = (1/20) + (1/-40) = (2 -1)/40 = 1/40. So f is 40 cm. So the radius would be 80 cm.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Let me check each option.

Option A: radius 160, f 80, m 2.5. R is 160=2*80, so f=80. Magnification is 2.5.

But according to our calculation, f is 40 cm. So option A is f=80, which doesn't match. So why is option A present? Maybe I made a mistake in the image distance.

Wait, perhaps I have the image distance wrong. Let's think again: if the object is 20 cm from the mirror, and the image is 40 cm beyond the mirror, but on the same side as the object. Wait, no, that would be a virtual image behind the mirror. Or, no, if the image is 40 cm on the same side as the object, which it is, then di is positive 40 cm. So 1/f = (1/20) + (1/40) = (2 +1)/40 = 3/40, so f = 40/3 cm ≈13.33 cm. But that's not positive, but f should be positive for a concave mirror.

Wait, but 3/40 is 0.075, so f= 13.33 cm, which is 40/3 cm. So f is approximately 13.33 cm. But that's not matching any option. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: radius 80 cm, f 20 cm, m 2.

So f=20 cm. Then, using mirror equation:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

1/20 = 1/20 + 1/di → 1/di = 0 → di is infinity. That can't be. So that option is invalid.

Option F: radius 60 cm. f=30 cm. So 1/f = 1/30.

1/30 = 1/20 + 1/di → 1/di = 1/30 -1/20 → (2-3)/60 = -1/60 → di = -60 cm.

So di is -60 cm. So the image is 60 cm behind the mirror.

But the question says the image is 40 cm from the mirror. So di=40 cm. So f would be 40 cm, which is not among the options except perhaps option A, which has f=80, but that would imply R=160, but f=80 would imply 1/f=1/20 + 1/40 = 3/40 → 1/f=3/40 → f=13.33 cm, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign convention.

Wait, another approach: since the image is behind the mirror, and the object is in front of the mirror, the image distance is negative. So, let's reevaluate the signs.

In this case, the object is in front (do = +20 cm), image is behind (di = -40 cm). So 1/f = 1/20 + 1/(-40) = (2-1)/40 = 1/40 → f=40 cm. So R=2*40=80 cm.

So the radius is 80 cm. What about the options? Let me look again:

Looking at the options, option A has R=160 cm (f=80 cm), option B: R=80 cm (f=20 cm?), but that's not what we have.

Wait, but in our calculation, R=80 cm. So which option has R=80 cm? Looking back, option H says R=80 cm, f=40 cm, and m=2.

Wait, option H's parameters: Radius 80 cm, focal length 40 cm, and m=2. So that would fit.

So what's the magnification? m = - (di)/do.

di is -40, do is 20. So m = - (-40)/20 = 40/20 = 2.

So magnification is 2, which is option H.

Wait, but why is the focal length 40 cm and not 80 cm? Because for a concave mirror, the focal length is half the radius. So R=80 cm → f=40 cm. That matches our calculation.

So the correct answer is option H. So any option that has R=80 cm, f=40 cm, and m=2 would be correct. Looking at the options, option H is the only one that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check option H. The parameters are Radius 80 cm, focal length 40 cm, and magnification 2. So yes, that matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option H.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the mirror equation and sign conventions. The mirror is concave, so the focal length is positive. The object is 20 cm from the mirror, and the image is 40 cm from the mirror. Since the image is virtual (formed on the opposite side of the mirror from the object), the image distance is negative. The mirror equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

### Step 1: Assigning values
- Object distance: \( d_o = 20 \, \text{cm} \)
- Image distance: \( d_i = -40 \, \text{cm} \) (negative because the image is virtual and behind the mirror)

### Step 2: Calculate the focal length
Substitute the values into the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{-40}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{2}{40} - \frac{1}{40} = \frac{1}{40}
\]

\[
f = 40 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the radius of curvature
For a concave mirror, the radius of curvature \( R \) is twice the focal length:

\[
R = 2f = 2(40) = 80 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the magnification
The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
m = -\frac{-40}{20} = -\left(-\frac{40}{20}\right) = -(-2) = 2
\]

### Step 5: Match the results with the options
The calculated values are:
- Radius of curvature: \( R = 80 \, \text{cm} \)
- Focal length: \( f = 40 \, \text{cm} \)
- Magnification: \( m = 2 \)

Looking at the options, **Option H** matches these values:
- Radius of curvature: \( 80 \, \text{cm} \)
- Focal length: \( 40 \, \text{cm} \)
- Magnification: \( 2 \)

### Final Answer:
**ANSWER: H**
