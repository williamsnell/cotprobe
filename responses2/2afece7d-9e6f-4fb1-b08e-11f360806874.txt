Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about study designs, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about a study evaluating the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches. They recruited 60 children, all getting usual therapy plus acupuncture three times a week for two months. The question is asking which study design this is.

The options are A to J, each representing different study designs. I need to pick the best fit.

First, let's recall what each study design means. 

Option A: Randomized control trial. That's where participants are randomly assigned to different groups to compare outcomes. But in this study, they're not randomly assigning; instead, all children are getting the same treatment. So A might not be it.

Option B: Case-control. That's a type of observational study where they compare a case (like having a chronic headache) to a control (those without the headache). But the study here is experimental, so B is probably not correct.

Option C: Case series. This sounds like a series of case studies, perhaps looking at several cases and their outcomes. But again, this seems more about analyzing multiple cases rather than comparing groups, so maybe not C.

Option D: Crossover. This is when participants switch from one treatment to another, like in a crossover trial where each participant takes both treatments. Not sure if this is applicable here since the design is about adding the same treatment over time, not switching.

Option E: Longitudinal. This design follows the same subjects over time, tracking changes. The study does thatâ€”each child is treated three times a week for two months, so it's longitudinal. That fits.

Option F: Meta-analysis. This combines results from several studies to reach a conclusion. But this is a single study, so F is not right.

Option G: Cohort. Cohort studies follow a group of people over time, often looking at the incidence of events. This study is about introducing a treatment and seeing the effect, which is more of a controlled trial rather than a cohort study.

Option H: Cross-sectional. This looks at a population at a specific time, not over a period. The study is over time, so H is not correct.

Option I: Qualitative study. This is about observations and interpretations without much data. The study is experimental, so I think it's quantitative.

Option J: Systematic review. This combines multiple studies to form a comprehensive analysis. Again, this is a single study, so J isn't it.

Putting it all together, the study is looking at a group of children for a period, giving them a treatment, and measuring the effect. That's longitudinal because it's following over time.

The study is evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches by repeatedly treating them over a two-month period. This design is longitudinal, as it follows the same subjects over time. 

Answer: E
