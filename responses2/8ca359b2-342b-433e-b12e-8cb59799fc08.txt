Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about neutralizing the gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon by placing equal positive charges on both. Hmm, right, because charges can exert an electric force, which if it's attractive, could counteract the gravitational pull between the two bodies.

Wait, but wait a second. The gravitational force between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them. The electric force between charges depends on their charges and the distance as well. So the idea is to find charges that would create an electric force equal in magnitude to the gravitational force, but opposite in direction. Oh right, because we want to neutralize the gravitational attraction, so the electric force should be repulsive, which would counteract the gravity.

I remember that Newton's law of gravitation says F_gravity = G * (M_earth * M_moon) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is mass, and r is the distance between them. And Coulomb's law says F_electric = k * (Q * Q) / r², where k is Coulomb's constant. Since we want F_electric to equal F_gravity, but in the opposite direction, but since both are positive charges, the electric force would be repulsive, which would counteract the gravitational attraction.

So setting them equal: G * (M_earth * M_moon) / r² = k * Q² / r². Oh, the r² terms cancel out because they're on both sides. So simplifying, G * M_earth * M_moon = k * Q². Then solving for Q, we get Q = sqrt( (G * M_earth * M_moon) / k ).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Because I'm only placing charges on both Earth and Moon, so each has a charge Q. So the product is Q * Q = Q². So the equation is F_gravity = F_electric.

But wait, the gravitational force is attracting, so the electric force must be repelling, which it is because both are positive. So that part makes sense.

So I need to compute Q such that Q² = (G * M_earth * M_moon) / k. Then Q would be the square root of that.

But wait, I think I might have gotten the formula wrong. Let me double-check.

F_gravity = G * (M_earth * M_moon) / r².

F_electric = k * (Q^2) / r².

Setting them equal: G * M_e * M_m / r² = k * Q² / r².

So the r² terms cancel. So G * M_e * M_m = k * Q².

Therefore, Q² = (G * M_e * M_m) / k.

So Q = sqrt( (G * M_e * M_m) / k )

I need to find the value of this expression.

But wait, I don't remember the exact values of the masses and the gravitational constant or Coulomb's constant. Let me think about the approximate values.

I think the masses are roughly:

Earth: about 5.97e24 kg.

Moon: about 7.35e22 kg.

The gravitational constant G is approximately 6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²).

Coulomb's constant k is about 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So let's plug in these numbers.

Compute numerator: G * M_e * M_m.

G = 6.6743e-11.

M_e = 5.97e24 kg.

M_m = 7.35e22 kg.

Multiply them:

6.6743e-11 * 5.97e24 = let's compute 6.6743 *5.97 ≈ about 39.8 (since 6 *6 is 36, 0.67*6 is about 4.0, 6*0.97 is about 5.82, so 6.67 *5.97 ≈ 39.8 approx.

Exponents: 1e-11 *1e24 = 1e13.

So 39.8e13 = 3.98e14.

Then multiply by M_m (7.35e22).

3.98e14 *7.35e22 = 3.98 *7.35 = approx 29.25, exponents 1e14 *1e22 = 1e36. So 29.25e36 = 2.925e37.

So numerator is about 2.925e37.

Denominator: k = 8.988e9.

So Q² = (2.925e37) / (8.988e9) = (2.925 /8.988) * 1e(37-9) )= approx 0.325 * 1e28.

So 0.325e28 = 3.25e27.

Wait, wait, no: 2.925e37 / 8.988e9 = (2.925 /8.988) * 1e(37-9) = approximately 0.325 * 1e28.

Wait, wait, 37-9 is 28, so 1e28.

So 0.325e28 is 3.25e27.

Then Q² = 3.25e27.

So Q = sqrt(3.25e27) = sqrt(3.25) * sqrt(1e27) = approx 1.8e13. Because sqrt(1e27) is 1e13.5, which is 1e13 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16e13.

Wait, sqrt(1e27) is 1e13.5, which is 3.16e13. So 1.8 *3.16e13 is around 5.69e13.

Wait, but let me do the exact calculation.

Wait, sqrt(3.25) is approximately 1.802.

So sqrt(3.25e27) = 1.802e13.5.

Wait, 1e27 is (1e13.5)^2, right? Because (1e13.5)^2 =1e27. So sqrt(1e27)=1e13.5.

So 1e13.5 is 10^13 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623e13.

So 1.802 * 3.1623e13 ≈ 5.69e13 C.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option E is 7.8e13, option G is 8.3e12, option H is 5.7e13, etc. So around 5.69e13 is closest to option H, which is 5.7e13 C.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the options sometimes have exponents. Let me check the calculations again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recheck:

G = 6.67e-11.

M_e = 5.97e24.

M_m =7.35e22.

Compute G*M_e*M_m.

G*M_e*M_m =6.67e-11 *5.97e24 *7.35e22.

Let me group the exponents: 1e-11 *1e24=1e13, *1e22=1e35.

So 6.67 *5.97 *7.35 = let's compute.

6.67 *5.97 ≈ 6 *6 is 36, 0.67 is about 4.49, 0.97 is about 6.46, so 36 +4.49 +6.46 ≈ 47. So approximately 47.

Multiply by 7.35: 47 *7 =329, 47 *0.35=16.45. Total is about 329 +16.45=345.45.

So 345.45e35.

So G*M_e*M_m = 345.45e35 = 3.4545e37.

Wait, wait, because 345.45e35 is 3.4545e37 (since 345.45e35 = 3.4545e37? Wait no, 345.45e35 = 3.4545e37 is correct because 345.45 =3.4545e2, so 3.4545e2 *1e35=3.4545e37.

So then, G*M_e*M_m =3.4545e37.

Denominator is k =8.988e9.

So Q²= (3.4545e37)/(8.988e9) = (3.4545/8.988) * 1e(37-9) = approx (0.382) *1e28 = 3.82e27.

Wait, wait, 3.4545 /8.988 is approximately 0.382.

So 0.382e28 =3.82e27.

Wait, no, 1e28 is 10^28, so 0.382e28 is 3.82e27.

So Q²=3.82e27.

So Q= sqrt(3.82e27) = sqrt(3.82) * sqrt(1e27) = approx 1.954 *1e13.5.

Wait, sqrt(1e27) is 1e13.5, which is sqrt(10^27)=10^(27/2)= 10^13.5 = 10^13 * sqrt(10) ≈3.1623e13.

So 1.954 *3.1623e13 ≈ (approx 1.954 *3e13 =5.86e13).

Wait, 1.954 *3.1623 is approximately 6.14.

So 6.14e13 C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 5.7e13 C, which is close to what I'm calculating. Option E is 7.8e13, which is higher. So the closest would be H.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Wait, let's recheck the exponents:

G * M_e * M_m: G is 6.67e-11, M_e 5.97e24, M_m 7.35e22.

Multiply the exponents: 1e-11 *1e24=1e13, *1e22=1e35. So the product is 6.67*5.97*7.35 *1e35.

Wait, 6.67 *5.97 is approx 40.0 (since 6*6=36, 0.67*5.97≈4.0, so 36+4=40). 40 *7.35= 294.

So 294e35 = 2.94e37.

Then denominator k=8.988e9.

So Q² = (2.94e37) / (8.988e9) = (2.94 /8.988) *1e(37-9)= (0.322) *1e28.

Wait, 2.94 /8.988 is about 0.322 (since 8.988 *0.32 is about 2.876, which is close to 2.94.)

So 0.322e28 =3.22e27.

So Q²=3.22e27.

Q =sqrt(3.22e27) = sqrt(3.22) * sqrt(1e27)= approx 1.794 * (1e13.5).

Wait, 1e27 is (1e13.5)^2, because (1e13.5)^2=1e27.

So sqrt(1e27)=1e13.5 = approx 3.1623e13.

So 1.794 *3.1623e13= about 5.66e13 C.

Wait, that's around 5.66e13 C.

Looking back at the options, option H is 5.7e13, which is the closest.

So the answer should be H.

To determine the positive charge required on Earth and the Moon to neutralize their gravitational attraction, we use Newton's law of gravitation and Coulomb's law. The gravitational force between two masses is given by:

\[
F_{\text{gravity}} = G \frac{M_{\text{Earth}} M_{\text{Moon}}}{r^2}
\]

The electric force between two charges is given by:

\[
F_{\text{electric}} = k \frac{Q^2}{r^2}
\]

For the forces to cancel out, we set \( F_{\text{gravity}} = F_{\text{electric}} \), which simplifies to:

\[
G M_{\text{Earth}} M_{\text{Moon}} = k Q^2
\]

Solving for \( Q \), we get:

\[
Q = \sqrt{\frac{G M_{\text{Earth}} M_{\text{Moon}}}{k}}
\]

### Given Values:
- \( G = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)
- \( M_{\text{Earth}} = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)
- \( M_{\text{Moon}} = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( G M_{\text{Earth}} M_{\text{Moon}} \):
   \[
   (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.97 \times 10^{24}) \cdot (7.35 \times 10^{22}) = 3.4545 \times 10^{37}
   \]

2. Divide by \( k \):
   \[
   \frac{3.4545 \times 10^{37}}{8.988 \times 10^9} = 3.82 \times 10^{27}
   \]

3. Take the square root:
   \[
   Q = \sqrt{3.82 \times 10^{27}} = \sqrt{3.82} \cdot \sqrt{10^{27}} \approx 1.954 \cdot 3.1623 \times 10^{13.5}
   \]

4. Approximate \( \sqrt{10^{27}} = 10^{13.5} = 3.1623 \times 10^{13} \):
   \[
   Q \approx 1.954 \cdot 3.1623 \times 10^{13} \approx 6.14 \times 10^{13} \, \text{C}
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
The closest value to \( 6.14 \times 10^{13} \, \text{C} \) is **5.7 \( \times 10^{13} \, \text{C} \)**, which corresponds to option **H**.
