Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about precipitation and solubility product constants. Hmm, I remember that when a solution has enough ions to exceed the solubility product, a precipitate forms. The question is about finding the minimum concentration of Br- that will cause precipitation of AgBr when the Ag+ concentration is 1e-5 M. Oh wait, the K_sp for AgBr is given as 4e-13.

So, let me think. The formula for AgBr is AgBr(s) ↔ Ag+ (aq) + Br- (aq). The solubility product Ksp is [Ag+][Br-] = 4e-13. Right, so Ksp is the product of the concentrations of each ion in the dissolution product.

Oh wait, but wait. The solution has a concentration of Ag+ at 1e-5 M. So, what's the condition here? If I plug in the Ag+ into Ksp, I can find the necessary Br- concentration to just start precipitation.

So, Ksp = [Ag+][Br-] → [Br-] = Ksp / [Ag+]. Plugging in the numbers: 4e-13 divided by 1e-5. Let's calculate that.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 followed by 12 zeros? Wait no, 1e-5 is 0.00001. So,

[Br-] = (4e-13) / (1e-5) = 4e-8 M. 

Wait that's 4e-8, which is 4 x 10^-8 M. So, looking at the options, option D is 4e-8 M. So, the minimum concentration needed would be 4e-8 M to exceed the Ksp and cause precipitation.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could there be any other factors? Like, what if the Br- is the limiting reagent? Hmm, no because the problem gives the Ag+ concentration, so we're calculating the required Br- to reach the Ksp.

So, the answer should be D.

To determine the minimum concentration of Br⁻ ion necessary to cause precipitation of AgBr from a solution with [Ag⁺] = 1 × 10⁻⁵ M and Ksp for AgBr = 4 × 10⁻¹³, we use the solubility product expression:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Ag}^+][\text{Br}^-]
\]

Rearranging for [Br⁻]:

\[
[\text{Br}^-] = \frac{K_{sp}}{[\text{Ag}^+]}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
[\text{Br}^-] = \frac{4 \times 10^{-13}}{1 \times 10^{-5}} = 4 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the minimum concentration of Br⁻ required to cause precipitation is \(4 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Among the provided options, this corresponds to option D.
