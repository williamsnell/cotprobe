Okay, so I've got this question here: 0.32 grams equals how many centigrams? Hmm, I remember that grams and centigrams are related units, but I'm not exactly sure about the conversion factor. Let me think. Oh wait, I think the prefix 'centi-' means one-hundredth, right? So 1 gram is equal to 100 centigrams because 'centi' is 1/100th. So if I have grams, converting to centigrams would multiply by 100.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says 0.32 grams. So 0.32 grams times 100 should give me the number of centigrams. Let me do the math: 0.32 * 100 = 32. Oh, so 32 centigrams. Looking at the options, option D is 32. So that should be the correct answer.

Let me just double-check. Oh yeah, because 1 gram = 100 cg. So 0.32 g is 0.32 * 100 = 32 cg. Yep, that makes sense. So option D is the right choice.

The correct answer is D: 32.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the units:** grams (g) and centigrams (cg) are related by the factor of 100. Specifically, **1 gram = 100 centigrams**.
2. **Set up the conversion:** To convert grams to centigrams, multiply the number of grams by 100.
3. **Perform the calculation:** 0.32 g * 100 = 32 cg.
4. **Match with options:** Option D is 32, which is the correct answer.

**Answer: D: 32**
