Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about paramecium and what happens when the macronucleus is removed. I'm a bit rusty on paramecium biology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that paramecium are simple organisms, right? They're single-celled and have a lot of basic life processes. The macronucleus is part of their cell structure. Oh wait, I think the macronucleus is the nucleus of the macron, which is the main organelle. So if it's removed, what's left?

Paramecium cells are usually haploid, meaning they have one set of each chromosome. The nucleus is diploid, so if we lose the macronucleus, the cell would have less genetic material. That makes me think about cell division. In normal cells, if the DNA is missing, they might not divide properly because they need DNA for replication.

Wait, paramecium reproduce via binary fission. So without the macronucleus, they can't divide as usual. That would lead to cell death because the cell can't split. So if the cell dies, the paramecium wouldn't grow. So option A says causes cell death, which sounds right.

Let me make sure. The macronucleus is the nucleus of the macron, which is part of the cell. When it's removed, the cell's nucleus is missing. So when the cell attempts to replicate, it can't. So it can't divide, leading to cell death. So option A is correct.

Looking at the options again:

A: causes cell death. — Yes, this makes sense.
B: The paramecium would grow in size. No, because if it can't divide, it won't grow.
C: Metamorphosis. Not really, because paramecium don't go through metamorphosis.
D: Increased activity. Not sure, but I think removing a major organelle might affect metabolism, but maybe not enough to cause increased activity. Or perhaps it would just die.
E: Increased motility. Paramecium are motile, but I don't think removing the macron would affect motility. They might move more slowly.
F: Cell multiplication. No, same as B, cell division would be lost.
G: Develop into a different species. Paramecium are all the same species, so that's not right.
H: Enhanced sensory. Not sure, but I don't think the macron is related to senses.
I: Sexual reproduction. No, they don't reproduce sexually. They're haploid, so they have to rely on binary fission.
J: Divide more rapidly. No, because without the macron, they can't divide as usual, so they might not divide as rapidly—maybe not divide at all.

So the correct answer is A. The paramecium would cause cell death because the nucleus is missing, so they can't divide.
</think>

The macronucleus is the nucleus of the macron, a key organelle in paramecium cells. If this component is removed, the cell's nucleus loses its DNA, preventing proper replication and division. As a result, the paramecium would not grow, leading to cell death. This makes option A correct.

ANSWER: A
