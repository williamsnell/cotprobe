Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is: If 4 cards are drawn at random without replacement from a deck of 52 playing cards, what's the chance of drawing the 4 aces as the first 4 cards? The options are A through J, each with different probabilities.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. We have a standard deck of 52 cards, and we're drawing 4 cards all at once, in order. We want the probability that these four are the four aces, right?

Wait, so the four aces are in the first four positions. That means the first card is Ace of Spades, the second is Ace of Hearts, third is Ace of Diamonds, and fourth is Ace of Clubs. Or any permutation of the four aces in the first four positions.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as the probability of drawing all four aces in the first four draws, regardless of the order. So, the total number of possible ways to draw 4 cards from 52 is 52 choose 4, which is 52!/(4! * (52-4)!).

And the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to draw the four aces in the first four positions. Since there are four aces, the only way this can happen is if each ace is drawn in the first four positions exactly once. So, how many ways can that happen?

Well, the first four cards are the four aces. But since the order matters, it's 4! ways because each ace can be in any of the four positions. But wait, no, because the four aces are distinct, but the first four cards must be all four. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 4! (because each ace can be arranged in the first four positions in any order). 

Wait, no. Because the order in which the aces are drawn in the four first cards can vary. But the problem is asking for the chance that the four aces are the first four cards, regardless of the order. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only one possible combination of the four aces in the first four positions), but considering the different orders, it's 4!.

Wait, no, no. The total number of ways to have the four aces as the first four cards is 4! because each ace can be in any of the four positions. For example, Ace1, Ace2, Ace3, Ace4 in any order. So, the number of favorable permutations is 4! = 24.

But wait, no. Let me think again. The problem is about the probability of the first four cards being the four aces, irrespective of the order. So, the first four could be Ace, 2, 3, 4, but any permutation. So, the number of favorable ordered sequences is 4! (since each of the four aces can be in any of the four positions, and the rest are non-ace cards). 

But wait, the total number of possible ordered sequences for the first four is 52 * 51 * 50 * 49, because each card is drawn without replacement.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of favorable ordered sequences over the total number of possible ordered sequences when drawing four cards. But actually, the total number of possible sequences for any four cards is 52 * 51 * 50 * 49. The number of favorable sequences is 4! because the four aces can be arranged in 4! ways in the first four positions, and the other positions can be any cards not including the aces.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the probability step by step. The first card has to be an ace, which has a probability of 4/52. Then, the second card must be another ace, which is 3/51, since one ace has already been drawn. The third card is 2/50, and the fourth is 1/49.

So the probability would be (4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) * (1/49).

Let me compute that.

But wait, that's the probability of drawing the four aces in the first four positions, but the order doesn't matter in this calculation. Or does it? Because in this approach, we're considering the first four as specific aces, but the problem doesn't specify order. Wait, but no—the problem is about the chance of the first four being exactly the four aces, regardless of order. So, in this case, this approach correctly calculates the probability because it's the chance that the four aces are drawn in any order in the first four positions.

Wait, but another way is to compute the number of favorable outcomes over the total possible. So, the total number of possible four-card combinations is C(52,4). The number of favorable is C(4,4) * C(48,0) = 1. But wait, no, if the first four are the aces, then the rest are any four non-ace cards. So, the number of favorable four-card hands is C(4,4)*C(48,0) = 1. So the probability is 1 / C(52,4).

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let's check which is correct.

Wait, the first approach I took step by step gives (4/52)(3/51)(2/50)(1/49) = (4!)/(52*51*50*49). Let me compute that.

4! = 24.

Denominator: 52*51*50*49 = 52*51 is 2652, multiplied by 50 is 132600, multiplied by 49: let's compute 132600 *49. Let's see: 132600 *50 is 6,630,000. Subtract 132600 → 6,630,000 -132,600 = 6,497,400. So denominator is 6,497,400.

24 / 6,497,400 = 24 ÷ 6,497,400. Let me compute that: 6,497,400 ÷ 24 is 270,725. So 24 ÷ 6,497,400 = 1 / 270,725 ≈ 3.7×10^-6. Which is 0.0000037. But wait, that's 0.00037%, which is 3.7e-5.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that option B is 0.000037, which is 3.7e-5, and option F is 0.000097, which is 9.7e-5.

Wait, but let me calculate 24 / (52*51*50*49) = 24 / 6,497,400. Let me compute this exactly.

24 ÷ 6,497,400.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 2 ÷ 541,450 = 0.00000369.

So approximately 0.00000369, which is 3.7e-6. That matches option B (0.000037). But wait, let me see if I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, 52*51 is 2652, multiplied by 50 is 132,600, then multiplied by 49 is 6,497,400.

Wait, 24 / 6,497,400 = (24 ÷ 24) / (6,497,400 ÷24) → 1 / 270,725 → 1 / 270,725 ≈ 3.699e-6.

So approximately 0.000003699, which is about 0.000037 when rounded to 6 decimal places as in option B (0.000037).

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The other approach I took step by step gave the same result as the combination method. So the probability is 24 / (52*51*50*49) = 24 / 6,497,400 = 3.699e-6.

So, that's approximately 0.000003699, which is 0.000037 when rounded to six decimal places. So the correct answer would be option B, which is 0.000037.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B was 0.000037, which is 3.7e-5. Wait, that's 0.000037, which is correct. So the answer should be B.

The probability of drawing the four aces as the first four cards is calculated by considering the chance of each ace being drawn in sequence. This results in the product of probabilities for each step, which simplifies to 24 (4!) divided by the total number of ways to draw four cards from 52, which is 52*51*50*49. This calculation leads to approximately 0.000003699, which is 0.000037 when rounded to six decimal places. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Answer: B
