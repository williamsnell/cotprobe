Okay, so I have this question here where I need to round 0.1476 to different decimal places. Let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that rounding involves looking at the digit right after the place you're rounding to.

So the number is 0.1476. Let's break it down for each part.

Part (a) is rounding to two decimal places. The two places are the hundredths and thousandths. The number is 0.14 in the first two places. The third digit is 7, which is more than 5, so I need to round up the second digit. So 0.14 becomes 0.15. So part (a) is 0.15.

Part (b) is three decimal places. The third digit is 7, and the next digit is 6. Wait, since we're rounding to three decimal places, we look at the fourth digit. The fourth is 6, which is more than 5. So we round up the third digit from 7 to 8. But wait, the third digit is 7, so 7 becomes 8. So 0.1476 rounded to three decimals is 0.148. So part (b) is 0.148.

Part (c) is rounding to one decimal place. The first digit after the decimal is 1. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we don't round up. So 0.1476 becomes 0.1.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be option C.
