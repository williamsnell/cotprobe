Okay, so I've got this question about inelastic demand, and I'm a bit rusty on my microeconomics, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see... the question is asking which situation would result in inelastic demand.

Inelastic demand means that the quantity demanded doesn't change much when the price changes. So, the price elasticity of demand should be less than 1. Oh wait, right! Price elasticity is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. If it's less than 1, it's inelastic.

Now, the options given are A to H. Let me go through each one to see which has an elasticity less than 1.

Option A: 10% decrease in price leads to 20% increase in quantity. So, the price change is -10%, quantity +20%. So, |20 / -10| = 2. That's elastic because it's greater than 1. So A is elastic.

Option B: 3% decrease, 5% increase. So 5/3 ≈1.666. That's elastic as well.

Option C: 2% decrease, 5% increase. 5/2=2.5. Still elastic.

Option D: 4% increase, 6% decrease. So, |-6/4|=1.5. Hmm, that's elastic because 1.5 >1.

Option E: 10% increase, 15% decrease. So 15/10=1.5. That's elastic.

Option F: 6% increase, 9% decrease. 9/6=1.5, which is elastic.

Option G:7% decrease, 10% increase. 10/7 ≈1.428. That's above 1, so elastic.

Option H:5% increase, 3% decrease. So 3/5=0.6. That's below 1, so inelastic. Oh wait, but wait—H is a 5% increase in price and a 3% decrease in quantity. So the elasticity is negative, but the absolute value is 0.6, which is less than 1. So, yes, inelastic.

Wait, but some sources say that inelastic demand is where the quantity doesn't change much when price changes. So, for inelastic, the price elasticity is less than 1 (in absolute terms). So in this case, H's elasticity is 0.6, which is less than 1, so inelastic.

Wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question asks which situation is inelastic. So, only H has an elasticity less than 1.

Wait, but looking again, let's double-check each option.

Another approach: for each option, calculate the absolute value of (price change / quantity change). If it's less than 1, inelastic.

Option G: 7% decrease in price → 10% increase. So, 10/7 ≈1.428 → elastic.

Option H: 5% increase in price → 3% decrease in quantity. So, 3/5=0.6 → inelastic.

So, the correct answer should be option H. Let me look at the options again.

H is option H, which is 'A 5% price increase results in a 3% decrease in the quantity demanded.' So the absolute value is 0.6, which is less than 1. So H is the correct choice.

To determine which situation results in inelastic demand, we calculate the price elasticity of demand using the formula:

\[
\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \frac{\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{Percentage Change in Price}}
\]

Inelastic demand occurs when the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is less than 1.

- **Option A**: 10% decrease in price leads to a 20% increase in quantity demanded.  
  \(\frac{20\%}{-10\%} = 2\) (Elastic).

- **Option B**: 3% decrease in price leads to a 5% increase in quantity demanded.  
  \(\frac{5\%}{-3\%} \approx 1.67\) (Elastic).

- **Option C**: 2% decrease in price leads to a 5% increase in quantity demanded.  
  \(\frac{5\%}{-2\%} = 2.5\) (Elastic).

- **Option D**: 4% increase in price leads to a 6% decrease in quantity demanded.  
  \(\frac{-6\%}{4\%} = 1.5\) (Elastic).

- **Option E**: 10% increase in price leads to a 15% decrease in quantity demanded.  
  \(\frac{-15\%}{10\%} = 1.5\) (Elastic).

- **Option F**: 6% increase in price leads to a 9% decrease in quantity demanded.  
  \(\frac{-9\%}{6\%} = 1.5\) (Elastic).

- **Option G**: 7% decrease in price leads to a 10% increase in quantity demanded.  
  \(\frac{10\%}{-7\%} \approx 1.43\) (Elastic).

- **Option H**: 5% increase in price leads to a 3% decrease in quantity demanded.  
  \(\frac{-3\%}{5\%} = 0.6\) (Inelastic).

Thus, only **Option H** results in inelastic demand.
