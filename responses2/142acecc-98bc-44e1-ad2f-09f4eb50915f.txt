Options:

A: $275 machine

D: Both are the same price
E: $300 machine with a 10% discount
F: $320 machine with a 5% discount
G: $250 machine with a 15% discount
H: $280 machine
I: $310 machine with no discount
J: $350 machine with a 15% discount

Okay, so I have this problem about buying sewing machines and figuring out which is the best buy. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The problem says: You can buy a sewing machine that's net priced at $275, or another one that's listed at $320 with a 12.5% discount. I need to determine which option is better and how much I save by choosing the better one.

First, I think I need to calculate the price of the second machine after the discount. The original price is $320, and the discount is 12.5%. Hmm, 12.5% is the same as 1/8, right? So I can calculate 1/8 of 320 and subtract that from 320 to get the discounted price.

Let's compute that. 12.5% of 320 is 0.125 * 320. Let me do the math: 0.125 * 320 = 40. So the discount is $40. Subtracting that from 320 gives 320 - 40 = $280. So the second machine costs $280 after the discount.

Now I need to compare the two options: the first machine is $275 net price, and the second is $280 with a discount. So which is cheaper? The first one is cheaper, so it's the better buy. That means by buying the first machine instead of the second, I save the difference between the two prices.

The first machine is $275, and the second is $280. So the savings would be 280 - 275 = $5. So I save $5 by buying the first machine instead of the second.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are labeled A to J. Looking back, the options are:

A: $275 machine – that's the first machine.
B: $320 machine – that's the second machine.
C: $320 machine with a 20% discount.
D: Both are the same price.
E: $300 machine with a 10% discount.
F: $320 machine with a 5% discount.
G: $250 machine with a 15% discount.
H: $280 machine with a 15% discount? Wait, no, the second machine is $280 with a 12.5% discount, not 15%.
Wait, option G says $250... maybe that's another discounted price. Let me see. Wait, no, the first machine is $275, and the second is $280. So G's description is different. Let me check each option.

Option C says $320 machine with a 20% discount. Let me calculate that: 20% of 320 is 64. So 320 - 64 = $256. So C's price is $256. That's cheaper than the first machine's $275. So buying the second machine with a 20% discount is better than buying the first one, but not as good as buying the first one because $256 is less than $275. So the best buy is option C.

Wait, but no, because the second machine after discount is $280, which is more expensive than $275. So the best buy is the first machine, which is $275. So the correct option is A, which is $275 machine. Because that's cheaper than the second machine's discounted price.

Wait, but wait, the question is about which is better. So the first machine is $275, and the second is $280, so buying the first is cheaper. So A is the better buy. So option A is better.

But looking back at the options, let me read them again.

The problem says: "Which is the best buy and how much will you save by buying it instead of the other one?"

So the best buy is the first machine. So the correct answer is A: $275 machine.

Wait, but option C is $320 with 20% discount = $256. That's cheaper than $275, so it's a better deal than A. But the first machine is cheaper, so A is better.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the second machine's discounted price is $280, which is more expensive than A's $275. So A is better.

But wait, the question is phrased as: which is the best buy. So the first machine is better because it's cheaper.

But the options are about what each machine is worth. So the best buy is the one with the lower price.

So the first machine is $275, the second is $280. So the first is cheaper, so the best buy is the first machine.

Thus, the correct answer is option A: $275 machine.

Wait, but maybe I should check what each option is offering.

So the question is, which is the best buy: compare the two machines.

If I buy the first (net price) it's $275, which is cheaper than the second machine's discounted price of $280.

So the first is better. So the best buy is the first machine.

But looking at the options, the first option is A: $275 machine. So that's the best buy.

Wait, but I'm also supposed to calculate how much is saved by buying the first instead of the second.

The savings would be 280 - 275 = $5.

But the question also says, "how much will you save by buying it instead of the other one?" So the savings are $5.

But looking at the options, I'm not seeing any option that says $5. Instead, the options are A: $275, B: $320, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for which is the better deal, and the amount saved is not an option, but the correct answer is the first machine as better.

Thus, the correct choice is A: $275 machine.

But another way to look at it: perhaps the second machine is being compared as "a 12.5% discount" on $320, which is $280 net. So the cheaper one is A, so the best buy is A.

So the right answer is option A.

The first machine is cheaper at $275 compared to the second machine's discounted price of $280. By purchasing the first machine, you save $5.
