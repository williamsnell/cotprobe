Question:

A researcher is hoping to find a predictive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables in her study. Accordingly, as part of her analysis she plans to generate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line for the two variables. The interval is determined to be (0.45, 0.80). Which of the following is (are) true? (Assume conditions for inference are met.) I. She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables. II. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables. III. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.

Options:

A: I only
B: I, II, and III
C: None of the above
D: I and II only
E: III only
F: II and III only
G: I and III only
H: Only II is likely, while I and III are not
I: II only
J: I and II are likely, but III is not

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about regression analysis, and I need to figure out which statements are true. Let me take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty on this.

The question is about a researcher generating a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line, which comes out as (0.45, 0.80). She wants to assess the validity of three statements, I, II, and III, and I need to determine which are correct.

First, let me remember what a confidence interval for the slope tells us. The confidence interval gives a range of values within which the true population parameter (the slope) is likely to lie, with 95% confidence. In this case, the interval is between 0.45 and 0.80. 

Statement I says she has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables. Hmm, wait. The confidence interval doesn't directly tell us if the slope is significantly different from zero. Because the interval is entirely above zero, that suggests that the slope is positive and not zero. But does that mean there's a good evidence of a linear relationship? I think yes, because the interval doesn't include zero. So a significant slope implies a linear relationship. So I think statement I is true.

Statement II claims it's likely that the correlation (r) is non-zero. The correlation coefficient squared is the coefficient of determination (R²), which is the square of the slope in simple linear regression. Since the confidence interval for the slope is between 0.45 and 0.80, the R² would be between 0.45²=0.2025 and 0.80²=0.64. So R² is 20.25% to 64%. That means the correlation is definitely non-zero because r squared can't be zero if the slope isn't zero. So II is also true.

Statement III states that it's likely the true slope is 0. Wait, the confidence interval is (0.45, 0.80), which doesn't include zero. So the true slope is not likely zero. Therefore, statement III is false.

Wait, let me double-check. The confidence interval for the slope doesn't include zero, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the slope is zero. That means the slope is significantly different from zero, implying a relationship. So statement III is definitely false because the slope is not zero.

So, looking at the options:

I: True.
II: True.
III: False.

Now, the options are:

A: I only
B: I, II, III
C: None of the above
D: I and II only
E: III only
F: II and III only
G: I and III only
H: Only II is likely, while I and III are not
I: II only
J: II are likely, but III is not.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the statements again.

Wait, the statements are:

I. She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables. → True because the confidence interval doesn't include zero.

II. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r). → True because r squared is between 0.20 and 0.64, so r is definitely non-zero.

III. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0. → False, because the interval doesn't include zero.

So the correct statements are I and II. So looking at the options, option D is "I and II only." So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but let me see the options again.

Options:

A: I only → Incorrect because II is true.
B: I, II, III → Incorrect because III is false.
C: None → No, because I and II are correct.
D: I and II only → Yes.
E: III only → No.
F: II and III → No, because III is false.
G: I and III → No, because III is false.
H: Only II → False, because I is also true.
J: I and II are likely, III is not → J says only I and II, but III is false. So J is also incorrect.
Wait, wait, no. Option J says II only. But we also have I correct. So J is incorrect because it doesn't include I.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The researcher's confidence interval for the slope is (0.45, 0.80), which does not include zero. This indicates that the slope is significantly different from zero, supporting a non-zero correlation (r) and the presence of a linear relationship. However, the interval does not include zero, so the true slope is not zero. 

- **Statement I** is true because the confidence interval suggests a significant linear relationship.
- **Statement II** is true because the interval implies a non-zero correlation (r).
- **Statement III** is false because the slope is not likely to be zero.

Thus, only statements I and II are true. 

ANSWER: D
