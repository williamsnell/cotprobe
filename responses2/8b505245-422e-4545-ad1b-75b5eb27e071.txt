Okay, so I need to calculate the magnitude of the spin magnetic moment of an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that the magnetic moment is related to the electron's spin. Let me think about the formula.

Wait, I think the spin magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e), where e is the charge of the electron, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and m_e is the mass of the electron. Oh right, but wait, I might have the formula wrong. I think the spin magnetic moment is proportional to the spin angular momentum, which for an electron is (1/2) ħ. So maybe it's μ = (e * ħ) / (2 m_e).

Oh wait, let me double-check. The spin magnetic moment is calculated by μ = (e/2m) * ħ, or something like that. Alternatively, I think the formula is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me look it up mentally. Oh wait, I'm trying to recall from my textbook. I think it's μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) multiplied by something. Let me think, the spin magnetic moment is given by μ = (eħ c)/(4 m_e), but wait, that's the gyromagnetic ratio. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(4m_e). So, the spin magnetic moment of the electron would be half of that, because electrons have spin 1/2. So that would make μ = μ_B / 2. Let me compute that.

The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T. So half of that would be around 4.637 × 10^-24 J/T. Hmm, looking at the options, let me see. Option A is 1.23e-23, which is about ten times larger. Option G is 1.47e-23, which is a bit larger than my calculation. Option B is 3.26e-23, which is roughly double my estimate. Option D is 0.91e-23, which is about 0.9 times, but that's smaller than my calculated value. Option H is 2.01e-23, which is around 2 times. So none of these exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back. The spin magnetic moment for an electron is μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e c) multiplied by something, but I'm getting a bit confused. Another thought: the spin magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e c) * ... wait, no, that's the gyromagnetic ratio. The actual magnetic moment is μ = g * μ_B, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio for spin. For an electron, I think the g factor is approximately 2 for spin magnetic moment. So μ = g * μ_B, where g is about 2.

Wait, no, the g-factor for an electron is 2, so μ = 2 * μ_B. But μ_B is (eħ)/(4m_e) as I thought earlier. So 2 * (eħ)/(4m_e) would be (eħ)/(2 m_e), which is what I had earlier. So 2*(9.274e-24) / 2 = 9.274e-24, wait no, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, no. Let me compute it step by step. Bohr magneton μ_B = (e * ħ) / (4 m_e). So μ = 2 * μ_B = (e * ħ) / (2 m_e). So substituting the numbers, μ ≈ (1.602e-19 C * 1.0545e-34 J s) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg).

Wait, let me compute that. Let's calculate the numerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.0545e-34 = approx 1.687e-53 J·s·C. Denominator: 2 *9.109e-31 kg = 1.8218e-30 kg.

So μ = (1.687e-53) / (1.8218e-30) = approximately 9.26e-24 J/T. So μ is about 9.26e-24 J/T. Looking at the options, that's very close to option G (1.47e-23) and option B (3.26e-23). Wait, 9.26e-24 is 9.26 times 1e-24, which is 0.926 times 1e-23. So 0.926 is between 0.9 and 1.0 times 1e-23.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.91e-23, which is 0.91 × 1e-23, and option H is 2.01e-23. So my calculated value is 9.26e-24, which is 9.26 * 1e-24 = 0.926 * 1e-23. None of the options exactly match. The closest is option D) 0.91e-23 or option G) 1.47e-23.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. Another way to compute it might be using the formula μ = (eħ c)/(2m_e). Wait, no, that would be in units of J/T, right? The formula should be μ = (eħ c)/(2 m_e c) — no, wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, I remember that the spin magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e), but let me double-check the formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e), so let's compute that numerically. Let me compute e, ħ, and m_e.

e = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C

ħ = 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s

m_e = 9.1093837015 × 10^-31 kg

So μ = (1.602e-19 C * 1.0545e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg)

Calculating numerator: 1.602e-19 * 1.0545e-34 = 1.689e-53 J·C·s

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg

So μ = 1.689e-53 / 1.8218e-30 = let's compute that.

1.689e-53 ÷ 1.8218e-30 = (1.689 / 1.8218) * 1e-23.

Compute 1.689 / 1.8218 ≈ 0.926.

So μ ≈ 0.926e-23 J/T, which is 9.26e-24 J/T.

Looking at the options again, let me check which one matches this value. Option D is 0.91e-23, which is 0.91 × 1e-23 = 9.1e-24. Option G is 1.47e-23 = 1.47e-23. So our calculation gives about 9.26e-24, which is 0.926e-23. Hmm, close to option D (0.91e-23) but not exactly. Or perhaps the options are rounded.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 1.23e-23

B:3.26e-23

C:2.20e-23

D:0.91e-23

E:1.61e-23

F:1.80e-23

G:1.47e-23

H:2.01e-23

I:1.00e-23

J:2.54e-23

Wait, none of these are approximately 9.26e-24. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another thought: Oh wait, perhaps the formula is μ = (eħ c)/(2 m_e c) — no, that can't be. Wait no, I think the correct formula for the spin magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e), and that's the value I computed.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a factor of 2 somewhere because the spin multiplicity is 2 for electrons. But wait, the spin multiplicity is 2, so the gyromagnetic ratio g is 2, and μ = g * μ_B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(4 m_e). So μ = 2 * (eħ)/(4 m_e) = (eħ)/(2 m_e), which is what I had before. So that's correct.

So μ = 9.26e-24 J/T. Now looking at the options, the closest option is option D: 0.91e-23, which is about 0.91e-23, which is 9.1e-24, which is very close to our calculated 9.26e-24. So the correct answer would be option D. But wait, 0.91e-23 is 9.1e-24, which is about 0.926 times the value I computed. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula.

Wait another moment: perhaps the formula uses ħ divided by (2 m_e c) instead of ħ/(2 m_e)? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think about the formula for the magnetic moment of an electron due to spin.

Wait, another approach: The spin magnetic moment is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) × (something). Oh wait, I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for mu in terms of other constants. Let me think again. The Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(4 m_e), so multiplying by 2 gives μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e) = 2 μ_B. So μ = 2*(9.274e-24 J/T) = 1.8548e-23 J/T.

Wait, that would make the value approximately 1.85e-23. But looking at the options, option F is 1.80e-23 and option G is 1.47e-23. So 1.85e-23 is closest to option F (1.80e-23). But wait, in that case, would the correct answer be option F? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me compute it again. Let's compute (e * ħ) / (2 m_e) numerically.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

ħ = 1.0545e-34 J·s.

2 m_e = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg = 1.8218e-30 kg.

So μ = (1.602e-19 * 1.0545e-34) / (1.8218e-30) = (1.687e-53) / (1.8218e-30) = approximately 9.26e-24 J/T.

So that's 9.26e-24. So 9.26e-24 J/T is the correct value.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: 1.23e-23

B:3.26e-23

C:2.20e-23

D:0.91e-23

E:1.61e-23

F:1.80e-23

G:1.47e-23

H:2.01e-23

I:1.00e-23

J:2.54e-23

None of these options match 9.26e-24. So perhaps the question is using a different formula, or perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought. The spin magnetic moment could also be calculated using the formula μ = (eħ c)/(2 m_e c) — no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (e ħ)/(2 m_e c) times something. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute option D and option G and see which is closer to 9.26e-24.

Wait, option D is 0.91e-23 = 9.1e-24.

Option G is 1.47e-23 = 1.47e-23.

So the difference between our calculation (9.26e-24) and option D is about 0.16% (since 9.1e-24 is 9.26e-24 * 0.99...). And the difference to option G is 9.26e-24 - 1.47e-23 = 9.26e-24 - 14.7e-24 = -5.44e-24, which is about 38% (since 1.47e-23 is 14.7e-24). So option D is closer.

But wait, let me think again about the formula. Another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the reduced Planck constant, but I don't think that's the case. Oh wait, I think I recall that the spin magnetic moment is given by μ = (eħ)/(2 m_e) multiplied by a factor of g, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio for spin. For an electron, which has spin ½, the g factor is 2. So μ = g * μ_B = 2 * (e ħ)/(4 m_e) )= (e ħ)/(2 m_e), which brings us back to the same value.

So with that, the correct value is approximately 9.26e-24 J/T, which is 9.26e-24. Looking at the options again, none of them match. But looking at the options, option D is 0.91e-23, which is 9.1e-24, very close. So perhaps option D is the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute all the options numerically and compare.

Let's compute each option and see which is closest to 9.26e-24.

Compute option D: 0.91e-23 = 9.1e-24.

Our value is 9.26e-24. So the difference is 0.06e-24.

Option G:1.47e-23 = 1.47e-23 = 14.7e-24.

Our value is 9.26e-24. Difference is 5.44e-24.

So option D is closer. So the answer would be option D.

Wait, but the options don't have 9.26e-24. So perhaps the question expects a different approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to compute spin magnetic moment is using μ = (eħ c)/(2 m_e c) — but that seems incorrect, as units wouldn't match. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula in terms of the Bohr magneton. Since μ = 2 μ_B, and μ_B is (eħ)/(4 m_e), then 2 μ_B is (eħ)/(2 m_e).

So again, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is μ = (g μ_B) where g is the gyromagnetic ratio. For spin, g is 2. So μ = 2 * (eħ)/(4 m_e) )= (e ħ)/(2 m_e). So yes, same as before.

So I think the correct answer is option D: 0.91e-23 J/T, which is 9.1e-24, very close to our computed value of 9.26e-24.

But looking back, the only option that comes close is option D. So the answer is option D: 0.91e-23 J/T.

To calculate the magnitude of the spin magnetic moment of an electron, we use the formula:

\[
\mu = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_e}
\]

where:
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) (charge of the electron),
- \( \hbar = 1.0545 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) (reduced Planck constant),
- \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the electron).

Substituting these values:

\[
\mu = \frac{(1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \times (1.0545 \times 10^{-34})}{2 \times (9.109 \times 10^{-31})}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 1.0545 \times 10^{-34} = 1.687 \times 10^{-53} \, \mathrm{J \cdot C \cdot s}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} = 1.8218 \times 10^{-30} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
\mu = \frac{1.687 \times 10^{-53}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} = 9.26 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J \cdot T^{-1}}
\]

This value, \( \mu = 9.26 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J \cdot T^{-1}} \), is closest to option **D: 0.91 × 10⁻²³ J/T**, which is \( 9.1 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J \cdot T^{-1}} \). While there is a small discrepancy, none of the options exactly match the calculated value.
