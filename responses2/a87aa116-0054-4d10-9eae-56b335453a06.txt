Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about defamation, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question carefully.

The scenario is a resident who lives across the street from a small office building. One of the office's employees is a criminal defense lawyer. The resident hates the idea that the lawyer's office would be close, so she doesn't want criminals in her neighborhood. She spends a lot of time looking out of her window to check on the office, trying to find out who's coming in and out. She feels that the lawyer's office might have criminals nearby and decides to drive them out.

She calls the lawyer and says she's scum. She claims that all her clients are bad, and that she knows the clients are conspiring to commit crimes. She also says that the police should arrest her and her clients. The lawyer, on hearing this, is upset. Now, the question is about the lawyer's claim against the resident based on the telephone call.

The options are from A to J, each making a statement about whether the lawyer will succeed in the defamation claim. I need to determine which option is correct.

First, I'll try to recall the criteria for defamation. Defamation typically involves false statements made with the intent to cause harm, and it has to be published in a way that it affects a significant portion of the audience. The statement must be made with malice (intent to cause harm) and must be made under oath or in good faith. 

In this case, the resident made a statement to the lawyer via a phone call. She said she was scum, and that all her clients were bad, and that she knew her clients were conspiring with criminals. She was trying to influence the lawyer's perception. But for defamation, the statement needs to be made in a way that it's considered a statement of fact, not an opinion, and it has to be published or communicated to others, not just her.

Looking at option I: "not succeed, because the resident's remarks were not published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff." Wait, the issue here is whether the statement was made in a public setting. The resident was making the call to the lawyer, who is the plaintiff. The statement was about the lawyer's office being near her home, which is a personal conversation, not a public setting. So, under the statute of frauds, statements made to individuals without a public purpose or channel are not considered published or communicated. 

So, the statement doesn't reach the stage of being published. That means the lawyer's claim is based on a statement that hasn't been made in a way that it's considered a significant public statement. Without publication, the statement isn't defamatory because it's not in a public setting. 

What's the standard for defamation? The statement must be published to cause harm to a significant portion. If the statement was made only to the lawyer, it's not published, so it's not defamatory. That would mean the lawyer's claim is not successful because the statement hasn't met the requirements of defamation.

Looking at the options, let's go through each:

A: Success because offensive and damaging. Maybe, but not if it's not a statement of fact. Also, not a publication.

B: Success because it's upsetting. But that's emotional appeal, not defamation.

C: Not succeed because it's a personal opinion. But defamation requires statements of fact, not opinions.

D: Success because the statement falsely accused the lawyer of committing a crime. That's a charge of slander, not defamation. defamation is more about false statements, not defamation of the speaker.

E: Not succeed because the lawyer chose to continue despite the statement. No, the statement is against the speaker's intentions, not about whether the lawyer continued.

F: Success because it's slander. Wait, slander is a type of defamation, but it's usually a statement that's false and published. The statement here is made to the lawyer, but it's not published, so it's not slander.

Wait, the question is about defamation, not slander. So, defamation is a broader term that includes slander. If the statement is made in a way that's defamatory, even if it's false, it's defamation.

Wait, the statement is false. The resident is accusing the lawyer of being a criminal defense lawyer, but that's not true. So the statement is false. But for defamation, the statement has to be made in a way that's defamatory. The fact that the statement is false doesn't make it defamatory if it's not in a publication. So for a statement to be defamatory, it must be made in a way that's defamatory and published.

So, since the statement was made to the lawyer without being published, it doesn't meet the criteria. Therefore, the lawyer's claim isn't successful.

Looking at the options, E says she chose to continue despite the statement. No, that's the opposite of what's happening. The person is suing on the basis of a statement she made, which is against their own actions, not their conduct. So E is not correct.

Looking at option I: "not succeed because the resident's remarks were not published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff." That's correct because the statement was made to the plaintiff (the lawyer), but it wasn't published. So the statement didn't reach the level of publication needed for defamation.

Option J: "not succeed because the resident has a right to express her feelings about the lawyer's profession." That's a right, but it's not sufficient for defamation. The statement must be made and published, and it must be defamatory.

So the correct answer is I. The lawyer's claim doesn't succeed because the statement wasn't published.

The resident's statement to the lawyer was made to the individual without a public purpose, making it not considered a published statement. Defamation requires statements to be made in a way that defamatory and published. Since the statement was not published, it did not meet the criteria for defamation. Therefore, the lawyer's claim fails.

**Answer: I**
