Question:

Intestinal motility is a complex process, orchestrated by nerves, hormones and the presence of food in the stomach. Which statement about this process is correct?


Options:

A: At the start of a meal, the stomach increases its "tone" in order to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus
B: The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, speeds up intestinal motility
C: The migrating motor complex is chiefly responsible for the absorption of nutrients after a meal has been consumed
D: The migrating motor complex is chiefly responsible for peristaltic movement of food after a meal has been consumed
E: The release of glucagon after eating a meal will speed up the emptying of the stomach
F: The stomach decreases its "tone" at the end of a meal to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus
G: The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility
H: The release of insulin after eating a meal will speed up the emptying of the stomach
I: The presence of partially digested protein and fiber in the duodenum, speeds up intestinal motility

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about intestinal motility. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says that intestinal motility is a complex process orchestrated by nerves, hormones, and the presence of food in the stomach. The options are A through I, each making a different statement. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll recall what I know about intestinal motility. I remember that the colon is part of the digestive system, and the main motor complex is called the migrating motor complex. This complex is responsible for moving food through the intestines. It includes smooth muscle in the colon, which is what causes the expansion and contraction, allowing food to pass.

I also remember that the presence of food affects motility. When you eat, you trigger certain hormones that increase motility. For example, the release of glucagon during a meal increases the speed of emptying the stomach. glucagon is an incretin hormone that injects into the small intestine, making it more permissive for digestion. So, option E and H talk about insulin and glucagon, which are related.

Looking at option A: It says that at the start of a meal, the stomach increases its tone to develop pressure leading to expulsion via the pylus. Pylians are the muscles in the colon that let gas out, right. But I thought the initial trigger is usually the release of certain hormones, not just increasing tone. So A might be incorrect because it's referring to the initial response, which might involve more than just tone.

Option B: Partially digested fat and starch in duodenum speeds up motility. I'm pretty sure that the duodenum is where most of the initial digestion happens. The duodenum is the first part after the stomach, so if there's some digested food, it would promote more motility. So B sounds correct. But I'll hold onto that thought and check the others.

Option C: The migrating motor is mainly responsible for nutrient absorption after a meal. No, I think the motor's main function is moving the food, not absorbing nutrients. Nutrients are handled by the digestive tract, not the motor complex. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The motor complex deals with peristalsis after a meal. Wait, peristalsis refers to the involuntary contractions that help force food through. The migrating motor complex is the main driver of that. So after a meal, the motor would also cause such contractions. So D says it's primarily responsible for peristaltic movement. Hmm, but some sources say that the migrating motor is the primary driver, so perhaps D is correct. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact role.

Option E: Release of glucagon speeds up emptying. Glucagon is indeed an incretin hormone that when released, increases the speed of emptying, especially during a meal. So E sounds correct.

Option F: Stomach tone decreases after a meal to expel. Stomach tone is related to the tone of the stomach muscles, which is regulated by the stomach's response to food. When you eat, the stomach's tone increases to push the contents through, not decrease. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Presence of partially digested fat and starch slows motility. Wait, no, the presence of digested food in the duodenum should increase motility. So G is incorrect.

Option I: Partially digested protein and fiber speeds up. Yes, digestible food increases motility. So I is correct.

Now, the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. Let's reevaluate each.

Looking back, the question says that motility is orchestrated by nerves, hormones, and the presence of food. So, all these factors influence motility.

Option E: Release of glucagon → speeds up emptying. Yes, glucagon is an incretin hormone that increases emptying. So E is correct.

Option D: The motor complex is responsible for peristalsis, which is a contraction to move food. The motor is the main driver, and peristalsis is a response to the movement. So D might be correct as well.

Wait, but the question says the process is orchestrated by the presence of food in the stomach. So the presence of food affects the motor's activity.

Wait, the question's first part says, "Intestinal motility is a complex process, orchestrated by nerves, hormones and the presence of food in the stomach." So the presence of food is a factor. Therefore, any option that correctly describes its role in this context must include that food is a factor.

Looking at the options:

A: At start, increasing tone → possibly correct, but the question says the process is due to presence of food. So A might not be the best option.

B: Presence of partially digested food → yes, correct.

C: Not relevant, so incorrect.

D: The motor is responsible for peristalsis after a meal. Well, the motor is responsible for peristalsis, but the peristalsis is a result of the motor's activity. So D says the motor is responsible, which is correct.

E: Glucagon → correct.

I: Partially digested protein and fiber → correct.

Wait, but the question's answer options are A to I, so each is a statement. So let's see.

Wait the question is which statement is correct. So the correct options would be those that correctly describe the process.

So, the question is: which statement is correct.

Looking again:

Which statement is correct?

The options are A to I.

So, the question is which statement correctly describes the correct process.

The process involves the presence of food (the stomach), and factors like hormones (glucagon, insulin) and the motor complex.

So, let's look.

Option E: Release of glucagon → correct because glucagon is an incretin hormone that increases emptying. So that's a correct statement.

Option D: The motor complex is responsible for peristalsis after a meal. Since peristalsis is a result of the motor complex's activity, D is correct.

Option E: Correct.

Option I: Partially digested protein and fiber in duodenum → correct, as it affects motility.

So which of these are correct statements.

Wait, but the question is which is correct, not multiple correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the initial process: The migrating motor complex is responsible for the expansion and contraction of the colon, moving food through.

So, the correct process is initiated by hormones, not just the presence of food. So presence of food is a factor.

Looking again at each option:

A: At the start of a meal, the stomach increases tone. This sounds more like the initial response, perhaps due to the release of certain hormones, not just the presence of food. So maybe A is incorrect.

B: Presence of partially digested food → yes, correct. So B is correct.

So, let me look at each option:

Option B: correct.

Option E: correct.

Option I: correct.

But the question says which statement is correct, so possibly multiple are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is phrased as "which statement is correct." So only one of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option is saying.

Option B says the presence of partially digested food in the duodenum speeds up motility. That's correct because digestion slows the process.

Option E says the release of glucagon → speeds up emptying. Correct because glucagon is an incretin hormone that increases emptying.

Option I: Partially digested protein and fiber in duodenum, speeds up → correct.

So, the problem is that the question gives multiple correct statements, but in reality, only one is correct. So I must determine which one is correct.

Alternatively, let's think about each option's accuracy.

Option B: The presence of partially digested food in the duodenum speeds up. Yes, correct.

Option E: Correct.

Option I: Correct.

Wait, but the question is which is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is more than one, but the options are presented as single-choice. Wait, no, the options are A to I, each being a separate statement.

So, for example, option B is correct, because the duodenum has partially digested food, which increases motility.

Option E is correct because glucagon speeds up emptying.

Option I is correct because digestible food (protein and fiber) speeds up.

But the question is, which statement is correct?

So, the question is which statement is correct about the process.

So let's evaluate each option.

Option B: The presence of partially digested food in the duodenum speeds up intestinal motility. That sounds correct. So B is correct.

Option E: The release of glucagon speeds up emptying. That's correct.

Option I: Partially digestible food speeds up. Correct.

Wait, but the question also states that the process is "organism's" regulation. So which option correctly describes the process.

But the question is asking which statement is correct, so all the options may have correct statements. But only one will be correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about what the process is due to. The presence of food is a factor.

So, the process is controlled by nerves, hormones, and food. So any option that includes that.

Looking back.

Option E: Correct. Because glucagon is an hormone, right.

Option B: Correct. Because the presence of partially digested food.

Option I: Correct. Because protein and fiber are digestible.

So, which of these is correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice single answer, so perhaps only one is correct. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, the question says the process is "organistries" (I think that's a typo; perhaps "organism"? Or is it "organism" as in the process of movement? The question might be in translation.

The question is: "Intestinal motility is a complex process, orchestrated by nerves, hormones and the presence of food in the stomach. Which statement about this process is correct?"

So, the process is controlled by the presence of food.

Looking again at each option:

Option A: At the start, the stomach's tone increases. The initial response to a meal may involve the release of certain hormones, but this doesn't mention food. So perhaps A is incorrect.

Option B: Correct, as discussed.

Option C: Not correct.

Option D: Incorrect, as the motor is the primary driver, and peristalsis is a result.

Option E: Correct.

Option I: Correct.

But all the options except for A, C, and possibly D are correct. So perhaps the question has more than one correct answer, but the options are presented as a single correct option.

Wait, perhaps the question is which statement is correct, but only one option is correct.

Wait, looking at each option again:

Option A: It's about the initial response, not the regulation by food. So incorrect.

Option B: Correct.

Option C: Incorrect.

Option D: The motor complex is primarily responsible for peristalsis, but peristalsis is a result of the motor's activity. So D is correct.

Option E: Correct.

Option I: Correct.

So, the question has multiple correct statements. But the options are A through I, each a single statement. So perhaps the question includes only one correct statement, and others are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the function of the migrating motor. The migrating motor is responsible for moving the food, and this process is controlled by the presence of food and hormones.

So, let me think about each option.

Option B: Presence of partially digested food → correct, as it speeds up motility.

Option E: Correct.

Option I: Correct.

So, they are all correct statements.

But the question is which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the process is controlled by the presence of food, all options that mention the presence of food would be correct, except for those that don't.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Correct.

Option E: Correct.

Option I: Correct.

But the question is giving us multiple correct options, but the options are single-choice. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

So, perhaps I need to find the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because glucagon is an important hormone, especially during meal times.

But also, option I is correct. Because digested food speeds up the process.

Let me think about each option's accuracy.

Option B: Correct.

Option E: Correct.

Option I: Correct.

Option D: Correct.

Wait, but the question says the process is controlled by the presence of food.

So all the options that include the presence of food are correct.

But the question is a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the process is controlled by the presence of food, but which option is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct about the process.

So the correct answer is the one that accurately describes the process.

Looking again.

The question is: Which statement about this process is correct?

So all the options that are correct (B, E, I, D) are correct.

But only one option is correct, according to the question's structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: Presence of partially digested food speeds up. That's correct.

Option E: Release of glucagon → correct.

Option I: Yes, correct.

Option D: The motor is responsible for peristalsis. Correct.

So, all these seem correct. So perhaps the question is a trick question, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is structured such that option B is correct, option E is correct, and option I is correct.

Wait, but the question is a single-choice, so perhaps I'm missing some key points.

Another approach: think about what each option says.

Option D says the migrating motor is responsible for peristalsis after a meal. But peristalsis is a result of the motor's activity. So D is correct in the sense that the motor is responsible for peristalsis, which is the movement. But the peristalsis is a result of the motor's function.

Wait, but when the question says, "the migrating motor complex is primarily responsible for peristalsis," that's correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the question is more about the regulation of the process, not the peristalsis.

Wait, the question is about what is correct about the process, which is a complex process. So perhaps all the options except one are correct.

Wait, another thought: the presence of food is a key factor, but what about the hormones?

Option E involves glucagon, which is an incretin hormone. Without it, the process might be slower. So option E is correct.

Similarly, option I refers to digestion. So if a person has partially digested proteins and fiber, that would speed up the process.

So, the correct statements would be B, E, I, and D.

But perhaps the question is only considering one of these.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because glucagon is a key hormone in the regulation of emptying.

Alternatively, the question may have only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the correct statement, and all the options except one are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps B is incorrect. Because in the duodenum, there's also some undigested material. Partially digested might mean some is, but not all. So B's statement could be correct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the question again.

The question says that the process is "organism's" regulation, so probably the answer is E, I, or B.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

Statement B is correct because in the duodenum, there's some undigested material that speeds up motility.

Statement E is correct because glucagon is an incretin hormone that makes emptying faster.

Statement I: correct as undigested protein and fiber speeds up.

So, the correct answers are B, E, I.

So, the question is which of the options is correct, so the correct answer is all three. But in a multiple-choice, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, the question says the process is "organism's" regulation. So which of the options is correct about the process. So perhaps all options except one are correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the motor is responsible for peristalsis after a meal.

Wait, but the motor is the main driver, and peristalsis is a result. So if the question is about the process being due to the presence of food, and the motor's role.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because glucagon is involved.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the process. When you eat, your stomach releases hormones, including glucagon, which increases the speed of emptying the contents. So option E is correct.

Another point: the migrating motor is responsible for moving the food, and the presence of food (duodenum) would increase motility. So B is correct.

Option I is correct as well.

So, the problem is that the question is a single-choice, but according to the analysis, multiple options are correct. But perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but perhaps option I is incorrect. Because not all the duodenum has digested material. Some is still undigested, so perhaps option I is incorrect.

Wait, but the question says "partially digested protein and fiber in the duodenum," which I think is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, the question is about the process. So, which option accurately describes a correct statement about the process.

So, the correct answer is E, because glucagon speeds up emptying. If I select E, that's correct.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of other sources.

Wait, the migrating motor is the main driver. So the presence of food would increase the rate of emptying, which is option E.

So, option E is correct.

So, in the options, the correct one is E.
</think>

The question asks which statement correctly describes the process of intestinal motility, which is regulated by nerves, hormones, and food in the stomach. The process involves the migrating motor complex, which is responsible for expanding and contracting the colon to move food through.

**Analysis of each option:**

- **Option A:** Incorrect. The initial response to a meal involves the release of certain hormones, but this is not the primary factor in motility. The presence of food is a key factor.
  
- **Option B:** Correct. The presence of partially digested material in the duodenum speeds up intestinal motility because undigested food slows the process, and digested food speeds it up.
  
- **Option C:** Incorrect. The migrating motor is not responsible for absorbing nutrients; it moves the food through the digestive tract.
  
- **Option D:** Correct. The migrating motor is responsible for peristalsis, which is a involuntary contraction that helps move food through the digestive tract. However, peristalsis is a result of the motor's activity, not the motor itself.
  
- **Option E:** Correct. The release of glucagon after a meal speeds up the emptying of the contents, as glucagon is an incretin hormone that increases the rate of digestion.
  
- **Option F:** Incorrect. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum slows motility, not speeds it up.
  
- **Option G:** Incorrect. The presence of partially digested food in the duodenum speeds up motility, not slows it.
  
- **Option H:** Incorrect. Insulin is a hormone that controls the rate of emptying, but the presence of insulin is not mentioned in the options.
  
- **Option I:** Correct. Partially digested protein and fiber in the duodenum speeds up intestinal motility as they are easier to digest and help reduce the force of the food.

**Conclusion:** The question allows for multiple correct statements (B, E, and I). However, the question structure implies a single correct answer. Based on the analysis, **Option E** is the most precise and directly addresses the regulation of motility by hormones (glucagon), which is a key feature of the process.

**Answer:** E
