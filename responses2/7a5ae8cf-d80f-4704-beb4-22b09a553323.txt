Question:

You are considering the purchase of a machine which will give you an annual return of $1,000 a year for 20 years. The return will be received uniformly and continuously over the years. How much can you pay for the machine and still obtain at least a 10 percent effective annual return on your investment in the machine?

Options:

A: $7,500
B: $11,000
C: $8,514
D: $10,000
E: $6,000
F: $12,000
G: $15,000
H: $9,500
I: $5,000
J: $20,000

Okay, so I've got this question here about purchasing a machine that gives an annual return of $1,000 for 20 years. The return is continuous, and I need to find out how much I can pay for the machine to still get at least a 10% effective annual return. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, effective annual return. Oh right, that's the real rate of return, not adjusted for compounding. So, I think I need to calculate the present value of an annuity. Because the machine is giving a constant return each year, it's like an annuity. But since the return is continuous, does that change anything?

Wait, no. The effective annual return is 10%, so maybe I should treat it as a standard annuity. Or perhaps the continuous interest affects the calculation. Hmm.

Oh right, I remember the present value of an annuity formula. For an ordinary annuity, the present value (PV) is calculated as PMT multiplied by the present value annuity factor (PVIFA). The formula is PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n]/r. Where r is the interest rate and n is the number of periods.

In this case, PMT is $1,000, r is 10% or 0.10, and n is 20 years. So I can plug those numbers into the formula to find the present value, which would be the maximum I can pay for the machine.

Wait, but wait, the question says the return is received uniformly and continuously. Does that affect the calculation? Because continuous returns might mean it's a continuously compounded annuity. But the question says the return is effective annual, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, maybe it's a continuous investment, but the return is continuous.

Wait, no, the problem states it's an annual return of $1,000 each year. So each year, you get $1k, and the machine gives that for 20 years. So the present value is the sum of each $1k discounted back to the present at 10% annually.

So I can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. Let's compute that.

PMT = 1000
r = 0.10
n = 20

PVIFA(10%, 20) = [1 - (1/(1.10)^20)] / 0.10

I think I can calculate this. Let's see, 1.1^20 is... Hmm, 1.1^10 is about 2.5937, so 1.1^20 is about (2.5937)^2, which is roughly 6.7275. So 1/6.7275 is about 0.1486. So 1 - 0.1486 is 0.8514. Divide by 0.10, that gives 8.514. So PV = 1000 * 8.514 = 8,514.

Wait, but that's the present value. So the maximum I can pay is $8,514. So looking at the options, option C is $8,514. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check if it's present value or future value. Oh, no, because the machine's return is received as an annual payment, so it's an ordinary annuity. So the present value is $8,514. So the maximum I can pay is $8,514. So the correct answer is C.

To determine how much you can pay for the machine while still achieving a 10% effective annual return, we use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The present value (PV) is calculated as PMT multiplied by the present value annuity factor (PVIFA). Here, PMT is $1,000, r is 10% (0.10), and n is 20 years.

The formula is:

\[
PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
PVIFA(10\%, 20) = \frac{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-20}}{0.10} = \frac{1 - (1.10)^{-20}}{0.10}
\]

Approximating \( (1.10)^{20} \approx 6.7275 \), so:

\[
PVIFA \approx \frac{1 - 0.1486}{0.10} = \frac{0.8514}{0.10} = 8.514
\]

Thus, the present value is:

\[
PV = 1000 \times 8.514 = 8514
\]

The maximum amount you can pay is $8,514, which corresponds to option C.
