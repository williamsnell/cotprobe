Question:

A landlord is the owner in fee simple of a tract of land on which is situated a large office building. The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions"(1) The tenant covenants to keep the building on the leased premises insured against fire in the amount of $100,000. "After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to a doctor, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the doctor assigned his leasehold interest to a dentist. The dentist went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. Soon afterwards, a fire spread from an adjoining building to the leased property, completely destroying the building thereon. While the tenant was in possession of the leased property, he carried a fire insurance policy on the premises in the amount of $100,000. However, the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after his assignment to the doctor. The doctor did carry insurance on the leased building, but only in the amount of $50,000. When the dentist took possession of the building, he did not obtain any fire insurance. The landlord learned that the building was not insured at the time of the fire as per the original agreement. In an action by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the fire loss, the landlord will most probably

Options:

A: recover, because the fire spread from an adjoining building, making the owner of that building responsible for the damage.
B: not recover, because the covenant to provide fire insurance did not run with the land.
C: recover, because in accordance with the Rule in Spencer's Case, the covenant to maintain fire insurance would "touch and concern" the land.
D: not recover, because the dentist, as assignee, would be liable for the fire loss.
E: not recover, because the doctor had partially fulfilled the obligation by providing insurance coverage of $50,000.
F: not recover, because the tenant had fulfilled his obligation by maintaining insurance during his possession of the property.
G: recover, because the dentist took possession of the property without obtaining any fire insurance.
H: recover, because the tenant's obligation to maintain fire insurance did not terminate after his assignment to the doctor.
I: recover, because the dentist failed to pay rent, which technically broke the lease agreement.
J: not recover, because the tenant no longer had control over the property after his assignment to the doctor.

Okay, so I've got this law question about landlord-tenant disputes, specifically regarding fire insurance. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So, the scenario is that a landlord leases a large office building to a tenant for seven years. The lease covers the building and its contents, and it includes a fire insurance policy. The tenant has some covenants about keeping this insurance. Here's the setup:

1. The lease starts on August 1, 2001, and ends midnight on July 31, 2008. So, that's seven years, right? The tenant took ownership three years earlier, in 2004, so now the lease is up.

2. Then, the tenant assigns the entire balance of the lease to a doctor. The doctor takes possession immediately. Then, in 2005, the doctor assigns his interest to a dentist. The dentist gets possession. But he fails to pay rent for two months. Then, a fire spreads from an adjoining building to the leased property, completely destroying the building there. The tenant, while in possession, had a fire insurance policy. However, this policy was canceled (lapsed) after his assignment to the doctor. The dentist didn't have any fire insurance.

The landlord is suing the tenant for the fire damage. The question is whether the landlord can recover, and which option applies.

Hmm. So, let's break down the facts. First, the original lease includes fire insurance, which the tenant covenants to maintain. So, the tenant should have provided that coverage from the start.

But here's the twist: the tenant assigned the lease to a doctor, and then the doctor assigned to the dentist. The key point is when the tenant allowed the policy to lapse. The tenant's assignment was in 2004, so the tenant's original agreement ran until the end of 2008. But the tenant's assignment to the doctor in 2004 would terminate the lease? Or does the original covenant run until the end of the lease term?

Wait, maybe the tenant's covenants run with the land. So, if the original agreement included the fire insurance, the tenant must have provided it from when the lease was signed. So, in this case, the tenant's covenants were in place from the start. But the tenant's assignment to the doctor in 2004 is meant to transfer the entire lease, including the covenants. So, the doctor's ownership would have the same obligations as the tenant, but the tenant's covenants were already in place.

But then, the tenant allowed the fire insurance policy to lapse after assigning to the doctor. Oh, but wait, the tenant's covenants were already to maintain the insurance. So, when the tenant assigns the lease, he's taking over the responsibility to maintain it. So, the tenant's assignment would have the same covenants as before.

But the key point is the assignment to the doctor in 2004. The original agreement runs for seven years, so the lease ends in 2008. So, the tenant is only in possession for four years, 2004-2008. But the original covenant was in place for seven years. So, when the tenant assigns the lease to the doctor, does that make the doctor's covenants to maintain the insurance run with the land as the original tenant?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the original covenant (fire insurance) was in place from the start. So, the tenant's assignment to the doctor would mean the doctor takes on the same obligations as the tenant. But the tenant's assignment also means that the original covenant (including fire insurance) is now with the doctor.

But wait, the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after assignment. So, the original covenant runs from when the tenant signed it, but the tenant's assignment to the doctor means the tenant's covenants are with the doctor.

But the problem is that when the tenant assigns the lease, the original covenant (fire insurance) runs until the end of the lease term. So, the tenant's assignment would have the same obligation to maintain the policy as the original tenant. So, when the doctor took over, the doctor is in the same position as the original tenant with respect to the fire insurance.

But here's the issue: the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after assignment. So, the tenant would have to terminate the lease by either giving notice or accepting a damages claim, perhaps. But in this case, the tenant didn't accept the rent because the dentist failed to pay two months.

So, the tenant is liable for the two months' rent, but the tenant's covenants ran with the land. So, the original covenant required the tenant to maintain the insurance. If the tenant allowed it to lapse, then the tenant would be liable under the covenant.

Wait, but the tenant was in possession for four years (from 2004 to 2008), so the original covenant would have run during those four years. So, in the original agreement, the tenant must maintain the insurance from 2001 to 2008. But they allowed it to lapse, meaning the tenant could take possession without the insurance, which would be a breach of the covenant.

However, the tenant is suing, but then the dentist had to pay two months in rent. So, the tenant is responsible for that. But the tenant's covenants ran with the land, so they must have maintained the covenant, even if they allowed the policy to lapse.

Wait, but the tenant's assignment to the doctor would have the same obligations as the original tenant. So, the tenant's obligation to maintain the policy is still a breach. Therefore, the tenant would be liable for the two months, as per the covenant.

But wait, the issue is whether the tenant can recover because the original covenant is still in place. So, the landlord is suing the tenant. But if the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, that's a breach of the covenant. So, the tenant is liable for the rent. But let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are A, B, C, E, etc.

Option A says the landlord can recover because the owner (adjoining building) is responsible. But in the original agreement, the tenant must maintain the insurance, so that wouldn't be the case unless the tenant allowed it to lapse. However, the tenant allowed it to lapse, which would create a breach of the covenant. So, option A isn't correct.

Option B says the covenant didn't run with the land, so the tenant didn't have to pay. But that's the opposite. If the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, that's a breach, so the covenant wasn't run with the land. So, B is incorrect.

Option C says the tenant will recover because in accordance with Spencer's Case, the covenant "touch and concern" the land. Spencer's Case is about the landlord covering the tenant's obligation to maintain fire insurance. So, if the covenant runs with the land, the landlord can recover. So, if the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, that's a breach, so the landlord can't recover. But wait, no—wait, no. If the covenant is breached, the landlord can recover under the covenant.

Wait, the issue here is whether the covenant was enforceable. In this case, the tenant's assignment to the doctor is to take over the lease. So, the original covenant runs with the land. When the tenant assigns the lease, he's in the same position as the original tenant. So, the assignment would have the same obligations as the original tenant. So, the tenant's assignment would have the same covenants, including fire insurance. But the tenant allowed the insurance to lapse. So, that breach would be an act of the tenant, not the landlord's duty to maintain the covenant.

So, the covenant runs with the land, so the tenant's covenants must be maintained. Hence, in the original agreement, the tenant must maintain the fire insurance. But the tenant allowed it to lapse, which is a breach. Therefore, the landlord cannot recover under the covenant; he must sue for breach of covenants. But the options don't present a choice about breach of covenant.

Wait, but the problem is that the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after assignment, which is a breach of the original covenant. So, the landlord can recover under the covenant—no, wait, the covenant is breached, so the landlord can't recover. Wait, the question is whether the landlord can recover for the fire damage.

Wait, but the options include that the landlord can recover, likely because the covenant was enforceable. Wait, perhaps I'm confused. Let's look at the options again.

Option C says the tenant will recover because in accordance with Spencer's Case, the covenant "touch and concern" the land. So, if the covenant is enforceable, the landlord can recover. But if the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, that's a breach of the covenant, which the landlord can sue for under the covenant, but the options don't have that. Instead, another angle.

Wait, another possibility: the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, which is a breach of the covenant. So, the covenant isn't enforceable, so the landlord can't recover under the covenant. But the landlord is suing for the loss, so he'll have to look elsewhere.

Wait, but in the original agreement, the tenant must maintain the fire insurance. If the tenant allowed it to lapse, that's a breach of the covenant. So, the landlord can sue for breach of the covenant. But look at the options. The options don't have a choice that says "can recover under the covenant"; they have a choice that says the covenant was touch and concern.

Wait, let me think again.

In the original agreement, the tenant must maintain the fire insurance. If the tenant allows it to lapse, that's a breach. So, the landlord can sue because the covenant was breached.

But the question is, does the covenant run with the land? That's what option C is about. If the covenant is enforceable, the tenant is liable for the breach.

But wait, in the scenario, the tenant is in possession for four years. The original agreement runs for seven. The tenant allowed the policy to lapse (after assignment) which is a breach. So, the covenant is breached, so the landlord can sue for that.

But looking at the options, option C says the tenant will recover because the covenant "touch and concern" the land. So, that's about the covenant being enforceable. So the landlord can recover under the covenant.

Wait, but the original question is a bit different. The tenant allowed the policy to lapse, which is a breach of the covenant. So, the landlord can sue for breach of the covenant, which would allow the landlord to recover.

Alternatively, another angle: in the original agreement, the tenant's covenants included not allowing the landlord to fail to maintain the insurance. But the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, which is a breach. So the landlord can sue for breach of the covenant.

But the options don't include a choice about breach; they have option C which talks about touch and concern.

Wait, another way: the tenant was in possession for four years (2004-2008). The original covenant was for seven years. So, the tenant was in possession for four years, which is less than the original term. But the original covenant is in place, so the tenant must maintain it. If the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, that's a breach, so the covenant was breached, making the landlord liable under that covenant.

But perhaps the issue is that the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, which is a breach, so the landlord can't recover. But in some jurisdictions, the landlord can recover under the covenant, perhaps if the tenant failed to maintain it, but in this case, the tenant allowed it to lapse.

Wait, but the problem is that the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after assignment, which is a breach. So, the landlord can sue for breach of the covenant, but that's not one of the options. Instead, the options A-D are about whether the landlord can recover.

In this scenario, the tenant is in possession of the property. But the tenant allowed the insurance to lapse, so the tenant is responsible for that. The landlord can sue for breach of covenants, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is more about the covenant's enforceability.

Wait, coming back to the question: the landlord is suing because the tenant allowed the policy to lapse after assignment. The tenant had covenants in place, so the covenant was breached. So, the landlord can recover under the covenant, but I'm not sure which option that corresponds to.

Looking at option C: recover because the covenant "touch and concern" the land. So, the landlord can recover under the covenant. So, the answer would be C.

Wait, but another approach: the original agreement runs until the end of the lease term (2008). The tenant allowed the policy to lapse. So, the tenant is in possession for four years. The covenant runs for seven, so the tenant was in possession for less. But in this case, the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, which is a breach. So, the landlord can recover under the covenant.

Alternatively, perhaps the tenant's assignment to the doctor in 2004 is a separate matter. Maybe the original agreement doesn't run with the land because the covenants were with the tenant, but when the tenant assigns the lease to another party, the new party may not have the same covenants. Wait, no, because the original covenants were in place from the start.

Wait, but the tenant's assignment to the doctor is part of the original lease. So, when the original tenant signed the lease, the covenant was with the land. So, the new tenant (doctor) is also in the same position. So, the doctor has the same covenants as the original tenant.

So, the original covenant requires the tenant to maintain the fire insurance. The tenant allowed it to lapse after assignment, which is a breach. So, the landlord can sue for breach of the covenant. But the options don't have a choice about that. Instead, looking at the options, option C says the landlord can recover because the covenant "touch and concern" the land.

Wait, but the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, which is a breach. So, the landlord can sue for breach of the covenant, but the options don't list that. So, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, another angle: The original covenant runs with the land, but the tenant allowed it to lapse. So, the covenant is breached, and the landlord is liable. But the options don't have a breach option. Instead, option C is about the covenant being touch and concern, which is about the covenant being enforceable. So, the landlord can recover under the covenant, so answer C.

Alternatively, the other options: let's think about each possibility.

Option E: "not recover, because the doctor had partially fulfilled the obligation by providing insurance coverage of $50,000."

But the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, so the tenant's part to maintain the policy is breached, not the doctor. So, E is incorrect.

Option J: "not recover, because the dentist no longer had control over the property after assignment."

Wait, the dentist took over the property after the tenant's assignment. But the original covenant was with the land, and the tenant took over the lease, so the tenant's covenants are with the land. So, the dentist is now the new owner, but the land is still with the original tenant. So, the tenant's covenants are still with the land, so the dentist doesn't have control over the property. So, the landlord can't recover because the dentist (new owner) is now in possession without the tenant's covenants.

So, the dentist's liability is irrelevant. So, J is incorrect.

Option A: the owner (adjacent building) is responsible. But in the original agreement, the tenant must maintain the policy, so the owner isn't responsible. So, A is incorrect.

Option B: the covenant didn't run, so the tenant didn't have to pay. No, that's the opposite. If the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, that's a breach of the covenant, so B is incorrect.

Option D: the dentist as dentist would be liable. But the dentist didn't have any covenants, as he took over after the tenant's assignment. So, the tenant's covenants are with the land, not the dentist. So, D is incorrect.

Option C: correct, because the covenant was touched and concerned. So, the landlord can recover.

Option F: correct, because the tenant failed to pay rent. Wait, but the problem is whether the tenant allowed the policy to lapse, which creates a breach of the covenant. The landlord can recover under the covenant, so F is incorrect. Because F is about the tenant failing to pay rent, but the problem is the breach of the covenant, not the failure to pay.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is C.
</think>

The landlord is sued for the fire damage, and the key issue revolves around whether the tenant's breach of the covenant to maintain fire insurance can be recovered. Here's the analysis:

1. ** covenant breach**: The original agreement included a covenant requiring the tenant to maintain fire insurance. The tenant allowed the policy to lapse after assignment, which is a breach of the covenant. This means the tenant is liable under the covenant.

2. **enforceability of the covenant**: Spencer's Case deals with the enforceability of a covenant that "touch and concern" the land. If the covenant runs with the land, the landlord can recover under it. In this case, the covenant runs with the land because the tenant maintained it after assignment. Thus, the landlord can recover.

3. **doctor's role**: The dentist failed to pay rent, but the tenant's breach of the covenant (fire insurance) takes precedence. The dentist does not have control over the property after the assignment, so the doctrine of the dentist's partial fulfillment is not applicable.

4. **other options**: The options B and E are incorrect because of the breach of the covenant. Option F is incorrect because the breach of the covenant is the primary issue, not the failure to pay rent. Option J is incorrect because the tenant's covenants are with the land, not the dentist. Option A is incorrect because the covenant was breached. Option D is incorrect because the dentist had no covenants.

**Conclusion**: The landlord can recover under the covenant that "touch and concern the land," as the covenant was enforceable and breached by the tenant.
