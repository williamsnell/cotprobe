Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again. So, I need to find the smallest positive integer that leaves different remainders when divided by 3, 5, and 7. The remainders are 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Hmm, okay, so I'm looking for a number N such that:

N mod 3 = 2  
N mod 5 = 3  
N mod 7 = 1  

I remember this is a Chinese Remainder Theorem problem. Let me think about how to approach it. Maybe I can solve it step by step by checking each condition.

First, let's consider the condition N mod 3 = 2. That means N can be written as 3k + 2 for some integer k. So, N could be 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29, etc.

Next, the condition N mod 5 = 3. That means N can be expressed as 5m + 3. So, numbers like 3,8,13,18,23,28,33, etc.

Now, I need to find a number that appears in both sequences. Let's look for numbers that satisfy both. Let me list the numbers from each sequence up to a certain point.

From the first sequence (N mod 3=2): 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47,50,53,56,59,62,65,68,71,74,77,80,...

From the second sequence (N mod 5=3): 3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48,53,58,63,68,73,78,83,88,...

Looking for common terms. Let's see:

23: Is 23 in both sequences?

Yes, 23 is in the first sequence (3*7+2=23) and also in the second sequence (5*4+3=23). So 23 is a common number.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me see if that's the case.

N=23: 23 divided by 3 is 7*3=21, remainder 2. Yes. 23 divided by 5 is 4*5=20, remainder 3. Correct. 23 divided by 7 is 3*7=21, remainder 2. Wait, no, remainder is 2? Wait no, 23 mod7 is 23-3*7=23-21=2. Oh, right. So yes, 23 satisfies all three conditions.

Wait, but the question is about the smallest positive integer. So 23 is the smallest? Let me check the options given.

Looking at the options: Option E is 23. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure there isn't a smaller number that satisfies all conditions. Let's see:

Check the numbers before 23.

Looking at the first sequence: 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23. Let's see which of these are in the second sequence (N mod5=3).

Looking at the second sequence up to 20: 3,8,13,18,23. So 8 is in both. Let me check 8: 8 mod3 is 2 (correct), 8 mod5 is 3 (correct), and 8 mod7 is 1 (since 7*1=7, 8-7=1). So 8 also satisfies all conditions. Wait, so 8 is smaller than 23. That's even smaller. Hmm, but then why did I get 23 earlier?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I matched the numbers.

Wait, the first sequence is 3k+2. Let's list the first few N from the first condition: 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47,50,53,56,59,62,65,68,71,74,77,80,...

The second condition is 5m+3: 3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48,53,58,63,68,73,78,...

So the numbers that appear in both sequences are 8,23,38,53,68,... So 8 is smaller. But wait, let me check if 8 satisfies all three conditions.

8 mod3 is 2: yes. 8 mod5 is 3: yes. 8 mod7: 8 divided by7 is 1 with remainder 1: yes. So 8 is a smaller number that satisfies all conditions.

So why did I get 23 earlier? Because I thought of the next common number, but 8 is smaller and valid.

Wait, but let's check the third condition for 8. 8 divided by7 is 1*7=7, remainder 1. Correct. So 8 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies all these conditions.

Wait, but looking back at the options given, I see option F is 12, which is larger than 8. Oh, but the options don't include 8. Wait, no, the options are A:8, B:31, C:10, D:37, E:23, F:12, G:14, H:52, I:15, J:26.

So 8 is option A. So why did I think 23 is the answer earlier? Because I perhaps missed that 8 is a smaller solution.

Wait, so the question is about the smallest positive integer. So 8 is the correct answer, which is option A.

But wait, let me check: 8 mod3=2 (yes), mod5=3 (yes), mod7=1 (yes). So 8 is correct. Then why did I think 23 earlier? Because I thought perhaps I made a mistake in the matching. Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let me try to solve it step by step.

Let me denote:

N ≡2 mod3  
N≡3 mod5  
N≡1 mod7

We can solve this step by step.

First, find a number that satisfies N≡2 mod3 and N≡3 mod5.

Let me express N as 3k +2. Substitute into the second equation:

3k +2 ≡3 mod5  
3k ≡1 mod5  
What's 3 inverse mod5? Since 3*2=6≡1 mod5, so inverse is 2.

Multiply both sides by 2:  
k ≡2*1=2 mod5  
So k=5m +2 for some m. Hence, N=3*(5m+2)+2=15m +6 +2=15m +8.

So N≡8 mod15.

Now, we have N=15m +8. Now, apply the third condition N≡1 mod7.

15m +8 ≡1 mod7  
15 mod7 is 1 (since 7*2=14, 15-14=1), so 15m mod7 is m*1 mod7. So:

m +8 ≡1 mod7  
m ≡1-8 mod7  
m ≡-7 mod7 → -7 ≡0 mod7 → m≡0 mod7.

So m=7n for some integer n. Therefore, N=15*(7n) +8=105n +8.

The smallest positive integer is when n=0: N=8. So yes, 8 is the smallest.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 8. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe 23 was the answer, but that was a mistake. Now I'm confident that 8 is the correct answer.

So the correct answer is option A:8.
</think>

The smallest positive integer N that satisfies the conditions is 8, which is option A.
