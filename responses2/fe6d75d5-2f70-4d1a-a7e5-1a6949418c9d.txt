Okay, so I've got this question about Piaget's stages and his concepts. I remember that Piaget's theory has several stages, each with specific milestones. The preoperational stage is one of them, and I think it's a key area in cognitive development. 

The question is asking about a accomplishment of this stage. Let me think about what each option refers to. 

The options are A to J, with each being a different cognitive ability. The preoperational stage is known for introducing concepts like conservation, simple arithmetic, and the ability to reason about objects without symbolic representations. 

Looking at the options, option E is the object concept, which I associate with later stages like sensorimotor and preoperational, not the preoperational itself. So E might not be the right answer. 

Option G is about understanding others' perspectives, which is more about social or social-processing stages, like the formal operational stage. So G probably isn't right either. 

Option F is abstract reasoning, which I think is more about the formal operational stage. 

Option B is deductive reasoning, which I believe comes into play later, maybe in the later preoperational stage or the formal operational stage. 

Option C is about reasoning about abstract concepts and problems. That sounds like exactly what the preoperational stage is known for. They can think about abstract ideas and solve simple problems. 

Option D is the symbolic function, which I think is part of the concrete operational stage. 

Option I mentions handling multiple variables, which is more about the formal operational stage, like the later ones. 

Option J is conservation, which is part of the object concept stage, again after preoperational. 

So the preoperational stage's key accomplishment is the ability to reason about abstract concepts and problems. So the correct answer should be option C. 

Wait, let me make sure. The preoperational stage is when children start to think symbolically. They can't do conservation yet because that's a later concept, so maybe J is not the preoperational stage's accomplishment. But the question is about the accomplishment, which C seems to cover.

The correct answer is C: the ability to reason about abstract concepts and problems.

Answer: C
