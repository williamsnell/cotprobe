Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a flywheel and its rotational kinetic energy. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to recall what I know.

The problem states that the flywheel has a mass of 30 kg and a radius of gyration of 2 meters. It's rotating at 2.4 revolutions per second. I need to find its rotational kinetic energy. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, rotational kinetic energy formula, right? I remember that the rotational kinetic energy (K) is given by (1/2) * I * ω², where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity.

Oh wait, the moment of inertia for a flywheel or any object that's a ring or a solid cylinder, I think, is I = m * r². Oh, right, the radius of gyration is the distance from the axis where the moment of inertia can be considered as if all the mass is at that radius. So the radius of gyration 'k' is given, and I can calculate I as m * k². That makes sense.

So let's break it down step by step.

First, find the moment of inertia (I). The mass m is 30 kg, and the radius of gyration k is 2 m. So I = m * k² = 30 kg * (2 m)². Calculating that: 2 squared is 4, so 30 * 4 = 120 kg·m². Okay, that's I.

Next, find the angular velocity ω. The problem states it's rotating at 2.4 revolutions per second. Oh wait, how do I convert revolutions per second to radians per second? Because that's the standard unit for angular velocity in the kinetic energy formula.

One revolution is 2π radians. So ω = 2.4 rev/s * 2π rad/rev. Let me calculate that. 2.4 multiplied by 2 is 4.8, so 4.8 * π. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 4.8 * 3.1416 is about 15.0796 radians per second. Let me double-check: 4.8 * 3 is 14.4, 4.8 *0.1416 is about 0.67968, so total is 15.07968 rad/s. Rounding maybe, but I'll keep it as 15.08 for simplicity, but perhaps I can keep it as 4.8π for exact calculation.

So now, the formula for kinetic energy is (1/2) * I * ω². Plugging in the numbers: I is 120 kg·m², ω is 4.8π rad/s.

Wait, let me do the calculation step by step.

First, compute ω squared. (4.8π)^2. Let's compute 4.8 squared first. 4.8 *4.8 is 23.04. So (4.8π)^2 = 23.04 * π². Since π² is approximately 9.8696, so 23.04 *9.8696 ≈ Let's compute that. 23 * 10 is 230, but let's do it more accurately. 23.04 *9.8696: let me calculate 23 *9.8696 first. 23 *9 is 207, 23*0.8696 is about 19.9988. So 207 + 19.9988 = 227. So approximately 227.04 *9.8696? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because 23.04 * 9.8696 is 23.04 multiplied by approximately 9.87.

Wait, 23.04 * 9 = 207.36, 23.04 *0.87 = about 20.0568. So adding together, 207.36 +20.0568 =227.4168. So ω² is approximately 227.42 rad²/s².

Now, I is 120 kg·m². So (1/2) * 120 * 227.42. Let's compute that.

120 * 227.42 = let's see, 120 * 200 is 24,000, 120 *27.42 = 3,290.4. So total is 27,290.4. Wait, wait: 227.42 *120 = 27,290.4. Then multiply by 1/2: 27,290.4 /2 = 13,645.2 J. Hmm, wait, but let me check my steps again because the options don't have 13,600 but option C is 10321.56, which is about 10,300. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately without approximating so early.

Let me re-calculate ω^2.

ω = 2.4 rev/s * 2π rad/rev = 4.8 π rad/s.

So ω^2 = (4.8)^2 * π^2 = 23.04 * (9.8696) ≈ Let's compute 23.04 * 9.8696:

23.04 *9 = 207.36,
23.04 *0.8 = 18.432,
23.04 *0.06 = 1.3824,
23.04 *0.0096 = approx 0.2215.

Adding them up: 207.36 +18.432 = 225.792; 225.792 +1.3824 = 227.1744; 227.1744 +0.2215=227.3959.

So ω² is approximately 227.3959 rad²/s².

Now, I = m * r² = 30 kg * (2 m)^2 = 30 *4 =120 kg m².

Then KE = ½ *120 *227.3959.

Calculating 120 *227.3959: 120 *200 =24000, 120 *27.3959 = let's compute 27 *120=3240, 0.3959 *120=47.508 → 3240 +47.508=3287.508. So total 24000 + 3287.508 =27287.508.

Then multiply by ½: 27287.508 / 2 =13643.754 J.

Wait, that's about 13,643.75 J. Looking at the options, option C is 10321.56 J, which is about a third of that. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I should use exact values without approximating so early.

Let me re-calculate ω² accurately.

ω = 2.4 rev/s * 2π rad/rev =4.8 π rad/s.

So ω² = (4.8)^2 π² = (4.8 *4.8) π².

4.8 *4.8 is 23.04.

π² is approximately 9.8696.

23.04 *9.8696.

Let me compute this more accurately:

23.04 *9 = 207.36,

23.04 *0.8 = 18.432,

23.04 *0.06 =1.3824,

23.04 *0.0096 =0.2215.

Adding all together: 207.36 +18.432=225.792; +1.3824=227.1744; +0.2215=227.3959.

So ω² is 227.3959 rad²/s².

Now, KE = 0.5 *120 kg·m² *227.3959 (rad²/s²).

So that's 60 *227.3959 = let me compute 60 *227.3959.

60 *200 =12,000.

60 *27.3959=60*27=1620, 60*0.3959=23.754 → 1620 +23.754=1643.754.

Total is 12,000 +1643.754=13,643.754 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 10321.56 J, which is about a third of this. That suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Could it be that I used the rotational speed in revolutions per second instead of converting it to radians per second?

Wait no, the formula uses ω in radians per second. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I confused the radius of gyration with the radius of the flywheel. No, the problem says the radius of gyration is 2m, so that's correct.

Wait another thought: did I forget to square the radius of gyration correctly? No, I have (2m)^2 which is 4 m², and multiplied by 30 kg gives I=120 kg·m².

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different formula. Oh wait, sometimes rotational kinetic energy is given by KE = (1/2) I ω². Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the multiplication of 60 * 227.3959.

Let me compute 60 * 227.3959 again.

227.3959 *60 = (227 * 60) + (0.3959 *60)

227 *60=13,620

0.3959 *60 = about 23.754.

So 13,620 +23.754=13,643.754 J.

Hmm, that's about 13,643.75 J.

Looking at the options: option C is 10321.56 J, which is about 1/1.32 of 13,643 J. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong in the radius of gyration. Could it be that I used radius 2 instead of radius of gyration being 2 m? Oh wait, no. The radius of gyration is given as 2 m, so that's correct.

Wait, another thought. Oh, wait, maybe the radius of gyration is given as the distance from the axis, so I = m r², which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the moment of inertia as m * (k^2), where k is the radius of gyration. Yes, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the correct formula for rotational kinetic energy.

Wait, let me compute it again.

I = 30 kg * (2 m)^2 =30 *4=120 kg·m².

ω = 2.4 rev/s * 2π rad/rev =4.8 π rad/s.

ω² = (4.8)^2 * π²=23.04 *9.8696 ≈227.3959.

KE =0.5 *120 *227.3959.

0.5 *120=60.

60 *227.3959=13,643.754 J.

So that's the correct calculation. But looking at the options, none of them match. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 4.8 squared. Let me compute 4.8 *4.8.

4 *4=16,

4*0.8=3.2,

0.8*4=3.2,

0.8*0.8=0.64.

Wait, let me compute 4.8 *4.8:

4.8 *4=19.2,

4.8 *0.8=3.84.

Adding: 19.2 +3.84=23.04. So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck because none of the options match what I'm getting. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 15432.98

B:16789.45

C:10321.56

D:9000.00

E:14832.12

F:11075.88

G:13643.74

H:12233.22

I:12500.00

J:20000.00

So, according to my calculation, 13643.75 J is option G. But the options suggest I might have made a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for rotational kinetic energy. No, that's correct. It's (1/2) I ω².

Wait, another thought: perhaps the radius of gyration is given in the other direction. No, the radius of gyration is the distance from the axis. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the multiplication. Let me compute 60 * 227.3959 again.

60 * 227 is 13,620.

60 * 0.3959 = 23.754.

13,620 +23.754 = 13,643.754 J.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: 227.3959 *60.

Compute 227 *60 = 13,620.

0.3959 *60 = 23.754.

Total is 13,643.754 J.

So none of the options match, but option G is 13643.74 J. That's very close to my calculation. So the correct answer would be G.

But wait, let me double-check the problem statement. Oh wait, the options are in the problem, so perhaps I should recheck.

Wait, the problem says the flywheel is rotating at 2.4 rev/sec. Oh wait, 2.4 rev/sec is 2.4 Hz. But the formula uses ω in radians per second, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: is the radius of gyration given as 2 m, or is it 200 cm or something else? Or maybe I made a mistake in the formula using the radius of gyration correctly.

Wait, no, the formula I used is correct. I think that's correct. So the correct answer should be G, 13643.74 J.
</think>

To determine the rotational kinetic energy of the flywheel, we use the formula:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity. The problem provides the following data:

- Mass of the flywheel: \( m = 30 \, \text{kg} \)
- Radius of gyration: \( k = 2 \, \text{m} \)
- Rotational speed: \( \omega = 2.4 \, \text{rev/sec} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the moment of inertia
The moment of inertia for a flywheel is given by:

\[
I = m \cdot k^2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
I = 30 \cdot (2)^2 = 30 \cdot 4 = 120 \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the angular velocity in radians per second
The angular velocity \( \omega \) is related to the rotational speed in revolutions per second by:

\[
\omega = 2.4 \cdot 2\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]

First, calculate \( 2.4 \cdot 2\pi \):

\[
2.4 \cdot 2\pi = 4.8\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]

Thus:

\[
\omega = 4.8\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \omega^2 \)
\[
\omega^2 = (4.8\pi)^2 = 23.04\pi^2
\]

Using \( \pi^2 \approx 9.8696 \):

\[
\omega^2 = 23.04 \cdot 9.8696 \approx 227.3959 \, \text{rad}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the rotational kinetic energy
Substitute \( I = 120 \, \text{kg·m}^2 \) and \( \omega^2 = 227.3959 \, \text{rad}^2/\text{s}^2 \) into the formula for \( K \):

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 120 \cdot 227.3959
\]

First, calculate \( 120 \cdot 227.3959 \):

\[
120 \cdot 227.3959 = 27,287.508
\]

Then, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 27,287.508 = 13,643.754 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 5: Match the result with the options
The calculated value is \( 13,643.75 \, \text{J} \), which closely matches option \( \text{G} \) (\( 13643.74 \, \text{J} \)).
