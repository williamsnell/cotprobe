Question:

The crown of a very carious tooth suddenly fractures while the patient is standing eating at a take-away food outlet and a fragment is inhaled. It is more likely to enter the

Options:

A: right lung because the right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left.
B: right lung because the fragment is more likely to be attracted to the right side of the body.
C: neither lung as the fragment would likely be caught in the throat.
D: left lung because the fragment is more likely to be attracted to the left side of the body.
E: left lung because the left main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the right.
F: right lung or left lung because the two main bronchi are of equal size and at the same angulation.
G: neither lung as the fragment would likely be expelled through coughing.
H: stomach because the fragment is likely to be swallowed instead of inhaled.
I: right or left lung because there are no factors predisposing to the fragment going in one particular direction.
J: esophagus because it is more likely for fragments to enter during swallowing.

Okay, so I have this question about why a fragment from a broken crown might enter a specific lung. Hmm, let's break it down. 

The scenario is a patient with a very carious tooth, meaning it's worn heavily, breaking easily. They're eating at a take-away food outlet, and a fragment is inhaled. The options are about which lung is more likely to receive it.

First, I remember that the right lung is actually the airway that's more exposed. The right main bronchus is wider and more vertical, which probably means it's more open. So that's a point. Also, the right side of the body is often drawn to the right, so maybe the fragment is more likely to go right.

Wait, but why is that? I think the right side of the body is more towards the right. So the airway there would direct the fragment towards the right lung. Also, the patient is eating, so maybe they cough a bit, which could send the fragment into the right bronchus.

Alternatively, if the fragment is swallowed, which option H says, then it would go into the stomach. But the question says it's inhaled, so it's more likely to be in the lungs.

Options A and E are about right or left based on bronchus width. The main bronchus of the right is wider, so more likely to go right. Right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left. So A and E suggest that. 

But the main bronchus's orientation is important. So the right's is wider, so it's a better fit for the fragment being in the right. So option E says the right main bronchus is wider, which supports that.

Options B and D talk about sides. The fragment is more likely to be attracted to the right side, so that's right. So B and D are less likely because the fragment is probably more likely to go into the right, not directly to the right side of the body.

Option C says neither because it's caught in the throat. But if the fragment is inhaled, it's in the airway, so the airway would direct it.

Option F says it's right or left because the bronchi are equal. But I think the right's bronchus is wider, so the fragment would go right, not left.

Option G says neither because it's expelled through coughing. But if the fragment is inhaled, it's more likely to be in the airway, not expelled.

Option J says esophagus. No, the esophagus is where food is passed through, not where a fragment would go if it's inhaled.

So the factors are the right's bronchus being wider. So the correct answer should be E: right main bronchus is wider than left. Wait, what about the direction? The right side is more towards the right. So the fragment would go into the right lung.

Looking at options, E says the right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left. That matches. So the correct answer is E. But wait, option A is similar. So the question is about the main bronchus, not the direction. So the main bronchus's size is the key factor.

Wait, but the right's main bronchus is wider, so the fragment would go into the right's. So E is correct.
</think>

The crown of a heavily carious tooth, when inhaled, is more likely to enter the right lung due to the following reasons: the right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left, and the right side of the body is more towards the right, aligning with the airflow in the right lung. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: right main bronchus is wider and more vertical than the left.**
