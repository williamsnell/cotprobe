Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about proton therapy and work done on a particle. Hmm, let me think. The question says protons are accelerated to about 0.6c, and I need to find out how much work is required to get them up to that speed. It starts from rest, so initial kinetic energy is zero.

Wait, I remember that work done on a particle is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. Oh right, the work-energy theorem. So the work W is equal to the final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy. Since it starts at rest, the initial KE is zero. So W should be equal to the final kinetic energy.

What's the formula for kinetic energy? KE = 0.5 * m * v². But wait, when dealing with speeds as a fraction of the speed of light, we need to use relativistic kinetic energy. Oh yeah, because at speeds close to c, the classical formula doesn't apply. So the relativistic formula is KE = (gamma -1) * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The proton is moving at 0.6c, so v=0.6c. Let me compute gamma first. 

v = 0.6c, so v²/c² = (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. 

So the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c² = (1.25 - 1) m c² = 0.25 m c². Wait, that gives 0.25 mc². But looking at the options, option D is 0.25 mc². So that would be the answer.

But wait, the options include other possibilities. Let me double-check. Oh, so I think that's correct. The work done is 0.25 mc². So the correct choice is D.

To determine the work required to accelerate a proton to 0.6c, we use the relativistic work-energy theorem. The work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy, which for a particle starting from rest is given by:

\[
W = (\gamma - 1) m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For \( v = 0.6c \), we find:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.36 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{0.64} = 0.8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Substituting into the kinetic energy formula:

\[
W = (1.25 - 1) m c^2 = 0.25 m c^2
\]

Thus, the work required is \( 0.25 m c^2 \), which corresponds to option D.
