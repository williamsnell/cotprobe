Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, we have two urns. The first one has 8 red balls and 7 blue balls. The second urn has an unknown number of red balls and 9 blue balls. We're told that when we draw one ball from each urn, the probability of getting two balls of the same color is 151/300. We need to find out how many red balls are in the second urn.

Hmm, so let's break this down. Let me denote the number of red balls in the second urn as 'r'. Then, the total number of balls in the second urn would be r (red) + 9 (blue) = r + 9 balls in total.

Now, the first urn has 8 red and 7 blue, so total of 15 balls.

The probability of drawing a red ball from the first urn is 8/15, and blue is 7/15.

For the second urn, the probability of drawing a red ball is r/(r+9), and blue is 9/(r+9).

We want the probability that the two balls are the same color. That could be both red or both blue.

So the probability is (8/15)*(r/(r+9)) + (7/15)*(9/(r+9)) = 151/300.

Let me write that equation:

(8r)/(15(r+9)) + (63)/(15(r+9)) = 151/300.

Wait, because 7 *9 is 63, and 15*9 is 135? Wait, no. Wait, 7/15 multiplied by 9/(r+9) is (7*9)/(15(r+9)) which is 63/(15(r+9)). Wait, but 8r/(15(r+9)) + 63/(15(r+9)) equals (8r + 63)/(15(r+9)).

So, (8r + 63)/(15(r+9)) = 151/300.

Now, to solve for r, let's cross-multiply.

Multiply both sides by 15(r+9) and by 300 to eliminate denominators.

300*(8r +63) = 15(r+9)*300.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me re-express it properly.

Cross-multiplying:

(8r +63) * 300 = 15(r +9)*151.

Wait, because 15(r+9)*151 is (15(r+9)) * 151? No, wait, the equation is (8r +63)/(15(r+9)) = 151/300.

So cross-multiplying gives:

(8r +63) * 300 = 15(r +9) * 151.

Let me compute that.

Left side: 300*(8r +63) = 2400r + 18900.

Right side: 15*(r+9)*151.

15*(r+9) is 15r +135.

15r +135 multiplied by 151.

Let me compute that:

15r * 151 = 2265r.

135 *151: Let me compute 135*150=20250, plus 135*1=135, so 20250 +135=20385.

So right side: 2265r +20385.

Now, equation is left = right:

2400r + 18900 = 2265r +20385.

Bring all terms to one side:

2400r -2265r +18900 -20385=0.

2400r -2265r is 135r.

18900 -20385 is -1485.

So equation becomes 135r -1485 =0.

Add 1485 to both sides:

135r =1485.

Divide both sides by 135:

r =1485 /135.

Let me calculate that.

135 *11 = 1485. Because 135*10=1350, plus 135=1485. So r=11.

Wait, so the number of red balls in the second urn is 11. Let me check the options. The options are H:9, I:12, J:13, A:14, B:15, C:7, D:8, E:6, F:10, G:11, H:9, I:12, J:13.

So H is 11, which must be the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.

Wait, let's double-check the equation:

(8r +63)/(15(r+9)) =151/300.

Cross-multiplying: 300*(8r +63) =15*(r +9)*151.

Compute 300*(8r +63) =2400r +18900.

15*(r+9)=15r +135.

15r+135 multiplied by 151:

15r*151=2265r, 135*151=20385. So 2265r +20385.

Equation:2400r +18900=2265r +20385.

2400r -2265r=135r.

18900-20385= -1485.

135r =1485.

r=1485/135=11.

Yes, correct. So the answer is H:11.

To determine the number of red balls in the second urn, we denote the number of red balls as \( r \). The total number of balls in the second urn is \( r + 9 \).

The probability of drawing a red ball from the first urn is \( \frac{8}{15} \), and from the second urn is \( \frac{r}{r+9} \). Similarly, the probability of drawing a blue ball from the first urn is \( \frac{7}{15} \), and from the second urn is \( \frac{9}{r+9} \).

The probability of getting two balls of the same color is the sum of the probabilities of both balls being red and both being blue:

\[
\frac{8}{15} \cdot \frac{r}{r+9} + \frac{7}{15} \cdot \frac{9}{r+9} = \frac{151}{300}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{8r}{15(r+9)} + \frac{63}{15(r+9)} = \frac{8r + 63}{15(r+9)}
\]

Setting this equal to \( \frac{151}{300} \):

\[
\frac{8r + 63}{15(r+9)} = \frac{151}{300}
\]

Cross-multiplying to eliminate denominators:

\[
300(8r + 63) = 15(r + 9) \cdot 151
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
2400r + 18900 = 2265r + 20385
\]

Subtracting \( 2265r \) and \( 18900 \) from both sides:

\[
135r = 1485
\]

Solving for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{1485}{135} = 11
\]

Thus, the second urn contains \( 11 \) red balls.
