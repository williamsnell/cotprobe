Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to approximate the integral of sqrt(e^(-x²) + 1) from -1 to 2 using Simpson's rule with n=6. Hmm, let me think about how Simpson's rule works.

Simpson's rule is a method for numerical integration, which means it's used to approximate the value of a definite integral. The formula for Simpson's rule is something like (h/3) times [f(x0) + 4f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 4f(x3) + ... + 4f(xn-1) + f(xn)], where h is the step size and n is the number of intervals. Oh right, and n has to be even for Simpson's rule to apply in this form.

Wait, the problem says n=6. Oh wait, n is the number of intervals? Or is n the number of subintervals? Oh, no wait, n is the number of intervals. Hmm, wait, Simpson's rule requires that n is even because it's using parabolas to approximate each pair of intervals. So if n=6, which is even, that's good.

Wait, the integral is from -1 to 2, so the width of the interval is 3. So the total number of intervals is 6, which divides into 3 subintervals of width h. So h would be 3/6 = 0.5.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Simpson's rule uses n subintervals, which must be even. So if n is 6, then the step size h is (b - a)/n. Here, a is -1, b is 2. So h = (2 - (-1))/6 = 3/6 = 0.5. So each subinterval is 0.5 units wide.

Now, the formula is (h/3) * [f(x0) + 4f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 4f(x3) + 2f(x4) + 4f(x5) + f(x6)].

Wait, wait, the function is evaluated at x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6. So let me list them out.

The x-values would be: -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2. Because each step is 0.5.

Now, compute f(x) = sqrt(e^{-x²} +1) at each x.

Let me compute each f(xi):

x0 = -1:

e^(-x0^2) = e^(-1) ≈ 0.367879441
So e^(-x0²) + 1 ≈ 0.367879441 + 1 = 1.367879441
sqrt(1.367879441) ≈ 1.169645985.

x1 = -0.5:

x1² = 0.25
e^{-0.25} ≈ 0.778800784
e^{-x1²} + 1 ≈ 1.778800784
sqrt(1.778800784) ≈ 1.333458213.

x2 = 0:
x2²=0
e^0=1
sqrt(1+1)=sqrt(2) ≈1.414213562.

x3=0.5:
Same as x1, because x3²=0.25, so same e^(-x^2) as x1. So f(x3)=1.333458213.

x4=1:
Same as x0, because x4²=1. So e^{-1}+1=1.367879441, sqrt same as x0.

f(x4)=1.169645985.

x5=1.5:
x5²=2.25
e^{-2.25} ≈ 0.105399236
e^{-x5²} +1 ≈1.105399236
sqrt(1.105399236)≈1.05136809.

x6=2:
x6²=4
e^{-4}≈0.018315638
e^{-x6²} +1≈1.018315638
sqrt(1.018315638)≈1.00913353.

So putting all these into the formula:

Compute each coefficient:
f(x0)=1.169645985 → multiplied by 1 (h/3 factor is 0.5/3=1/6, but wait, the formula is (h/3) times sum. So h is 0.5, so h/3 is 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1666666667.

So let's list the coefficients for each xi:

i=0 → coefficient 1
i=1 → 4
i=2 → 2
i=3 →4
i=4 →2
i=5 →4
i=6 →1

So in order, the terms are:

Term 0: 1 * f(x0) = 1 * 1.169645985
Term 1: 4 * f(x1) = 4 * 1.333458213
Term 2: 2 * f(x2) = 2 * 1.414213562
Term3:4*f(x3)=4*1.333458213
Term4:2*f(x4)=2*1.169645985
Term5:4*f(x5)=4*1.05136809
Term6:1*f(x6)=1*1.00913353

Now let's compute each term:

Term0: 1.169645985

Term1: 4 * 1.333458213 = 5.333832852

Term2: 2 *1.414213562=2.828427124

Term3: same as term1 →5.333832852

Term4: 2 *1.169645985=2.33929197

Term5:4 *1.05136809 =4.20547236

Term6:1.00913353

Now sum all these terms:

Let me add them step by step.

Start with term0: 1.169645985

Add term1: 1.169645985 +5.333832852 =6.503478837

Add term2:6.503478837 +2.828427124=9.331905961

Add term3: same as term1 →9.331905961 +5.333832852=14.66573881

Add term4:14.66573881 +2.33929197=17.00503078

Add term5:17.00503078 +4.20547236=21.21050314

Add term6:21.21050314 +1.00913353=22.21963667

Wait, let's sum again, to make sure I don't make a mistake.

Wait, in term2: 2.828427124.

Let me add all terms:

1.169645985
+5.333832852 =6.503478837
+2.828427124 =9.331905961
+5.333832852=14.66573881
+2.33929197=17.00503078
+4.20547236=21.21050314
+1.00913353=22.21963667

Now multiply this sum by (h/3) which is 0.5/3 ≈ 0.1666666667.

So 22.21963667 * 0.1666666667 ≈ Let's compute it.

22.21963667 * (0.1666666667) = approximately 22.21963667 /6.

Let me compute 22.21963667 divided by 6.

6 * 3.70327278 =22.21963668.

Wait, 6 * 3.70327278 = 22.21963668.

So 22.21963667 /6 ≈ 3.70327278.

So the approximate integral is approximately 3.70327278.

Term1:4*1.333458213=5.333832852

Term2:2*1.414213562=2.828427124

Term3: same as term1:5.333832852

Term4:2*1.169645985=2.33929197

Term5:4*1.05136809=4.20547236

Term6:1.00913353

Now adding all terms:

Start with term0: 1.169645985

Add term1: 1.169645985 +5.333832852 =6.503478837

Add term2:6.503478837 +2.828427124=9.331905961

Add term3:9.331905961 +5.333832852=14.665738813

Add term4:14.665738813 +2.33929197=17.005030783

Add term5:17.005030783 +4.20547236=21.210503143

Add term6:21.210503143 +1.00913353=22.219636673

So the sum is 22.219636673. Multiply by (0.5/3) = 0.16666666666666666.

22.219636673 * (1/6) ≈ 3.703272779. So approximately 3.70327.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.70358145, which is very close to this. So the answer should be option B.

To approximate the integral $\int_{-1}^2 \sqrt{e^{-x^2} + 1} \, dx$ using Simpson's rule with $n = 6$, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the width of each subinterval**:  
   The interval is from $x = -1$ to $x = 2$, so the total width is $3$. With $n = 6$ intervals, the width of each subinterval is:  
   \[
   h = \frac{b - a}{n} = \frac{2 - (-1)}{6} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Identify the points and function values**:  
   The points are $x_0 = -1, x_1 = -0.5, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0.5, x_4 = 1, x_5 = 1.5, x_6 = 2$. The function $f(x) = \sqrt{e^{-x^2} + 1}$ is evaluated at each point:  
   - $f(x_0) = f(-1) \approx 1.169645985$
   - $f(x_1) = f(-0.5) \approx 1.333458213$
   - $f(x_2) = f(0) \approx 1.414213562$
   - $f(x_3) = f(0.5) = f(-0.5) \approx 1.333458213$
   - $f(x_4) = f(1) = f(-1) \approx 1.169645985$
   - $f(x_5) = f(1.5) \approx 1.05136809$
   - $f(x_6) = f(2) \approx 1.00913353$

3. **Apply Simpson's rule formula**:  
   Simpson's rule for $n = 6$ (even) is:  
   \[
   \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{h}{3} \left[ f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 4f(x_3) + 2f(x_4) + 4f(x_5) + f(x_6) \right]
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Approximation} = \frac{0.5}{3} \left[ 1.169645985 + 4(1.333458213) + 2(1.414213562) + 4(1.333458213) + 2(1.169645985) + 4(1.05136809) + 1.00913353 \right]
   \]  
   Compute the terms:  
   - $f(x_0) = 1.169645985$  
   - $4f(x_1) = 5.333832852$  
   - $2f(x_2) = 2.828427124$  
   - $4f(x_3) = 5.333832852$  
   - $2f(x_4) = 2.33929197$  
   - $4f(x_5) = 4.20547236$  
   - $f(x_6) = 1.00913353$  
   Summing these:  
   \[
   1.169645985 + 5.333832852 + 2.828427124 + 5.333832852 + 2.33929197 + 4.20547236 + 1.00913353 \approx 22.21963667
   \]  
   Multiply by $\frac{h}{3} = \frac{0.5}{3} \approx 0.1666666667$:  
   \[
   \text{Approximation} = 0.1666666667 \times 22.21963667 \approx 3.70327278
   \]

4. **Compare with options**:  
   The calculated value is approximately $3.70327278$, which matches option **B: 3.70358145**. The slight difference is due to rounding.
