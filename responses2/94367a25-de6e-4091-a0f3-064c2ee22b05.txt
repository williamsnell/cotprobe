C: 0.50 g
D: 0.75 g
E: 0.375 g
F: 0.000625 g
G: 1.00 g

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. Right, and the formula for radioactive decay involves using the half-life to calculate the remaining amount. 

The question says the half-life is 1 hour. So every hour, half of what's left decays. We start with 1.000 gram at noon, and we need to find out how much remains at 3:00 pm. Let me think about the time difference.

From noon to 3:00 pm is 3 hours. Since the half-life is 1 hour, that's 3 half-lives. So each hour, the amount is halved. Let me break it down step by step.

At noon: 1.000 grams. That's the starting point.

First hour (1 pm): 1 gram * 0.5 = 0.5 grams.

Second hour (2 pm): 0.5 grams * 0.5 = 0.25 grams.

Third hour (3 pm): 0.25 grams * 0.5 = 0.125 grams.

Wait, so after three half-lives, 0.125 grams remain. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Alternative approach: the formula is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). So N0 is 1.000 g, t is 3 hours, t_half is 1.

So N = 1 * (1/2)^3 = 1/8 = 0.125 g. Looking at the options, that's option I: 0.125 g. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh yes, option I is 0.125, others include options like 0.75, which is 3 halves. Wait, no, wait another moment. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1/2^3 is 1/8, which is 0.125. So that's correct. So option I is correct? But the options also have other values. Let me double-check the time.

Wait, 3 hours is three half-lives, so yes, 0.125 grams. Looking at the options, option I is 0.125, which is correct. So the answer should be option I.

The question involves calculating the remaining amount of a radioactive substance after a certain time using the concept of half-life. The sample has a half-life of 1 hour, and we start with 1.000 gram at noon. We need to determine the amount remaining at 3:00 pm, which is 3 hours later.

The half-life formula is \( N = N_0 \times (1/2)^{t / t_{\text{half}}} \), where:
- \( N_0 = 1.000 \, \text{g} \) (initial amount),
- \( t = 3 \, \text{hours} \),
- \( t_{\text{half}} = 1 \, \text{hour} \).

Substituting the values:
\[
N = 1.000 \times (1/2)^3 = 1.000 \times 1/8 = 0.125 \, \text{g}.
\]

This corresponds to option I: 0.125 g.
