Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Cicero's argument. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about what Cicero would argue that we won't morally astray if we do a certain action. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. 

I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher, and he wrote on moral philosophy. I think his argument is about what we should believe. One of the key themes in his works is the importance of reason and the self-interest of human nature. He might have talked about the idea that we should rely on reason rather than external factors like religion, history, or nature.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: follow religious edicts. Cicero probably wouldn't support this because religion can be manipulated and doesn't reflect human nature. 

Option B: follow historical precedents. While history is important, it's not the only source of moral guidance. It's more about what has worked in the past. 

Option C: follow the teachings of philosophers. Cicero was a major philosopher, but he might stress the importance of personal reason and self-interest. 

Option D: follow Nature as our guide. No, nature isn't the primary source of moral guidance. 

Option E: follow our conscience. Conscience is a component, but it's not the main reason. 

Option F: follow the laws. While laws are important, they're more of an external guide, not the reason to follow oneself. 

Option G: follow our personal desires. That's more about being driven by emotions, not a moral approach. 

Option H: follow our instincts. I think instinct is part of human nature, but Cicero might argue that reason is more reliable. 

Option I: follow societal norms. Societal norms are things we agree on, but they don't ensure moral behavior. 

Option J: follow our friends and family. That’s more about social influence and personal behavior, not a moral approach.

Wait, I think Cicero said that we should follow the self-interest of our own reason. So the idea is that we should reason for itself rather than following external factors. So the correct answer is E: follow our conscience. No, wait, E is about conscience, which is a part of self-interest. But if Cicero is saying we shouldn't follow external factors, then he might argue against option E. 

Alternatively, I remember that Cicero's argument is that we should rely on our own reason and self-interest, rather than external things like religion, history, nature, or societal norms. So the answer would be E: follow our conscience. Or wait, perhaps he's saying that we should follow our own conscience, which is a self-reasoning approach. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: in his "On the Virtues" or other works, Cicero discussed how we should act based on our own reason. So he might argue that we should follow our own conscience, as it's the highest form of reason. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F: follow the laws. No, because laws are more authoritative and enforceable. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question is about which option represents Cicero's stance. I think he would argue against following external factors, but F is about following the laws. So perhaps he argues against external factors, but in the options, F is about following the laws. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: follow our conscience. No, because he doesn't say we should follow our own conscience. He says we follow our reason. Oh, wait, no, in E it's "conscience," which is self-interest. 

Wait, another angle: in the context of "Ethics in the Old World," Cicero discusses the four cardinal virtues: self-love, justice, kindness, and枣erence. Self-love is self-interest, so he might say we should follow self-love. But that's not an option here.

Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is E: follow our conscience. Or maybe the answer is F: follow the laws, but I think that's incorrect because Cicero doesn't agree with the authority of external laws. 

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think about the options again. The options are A to J, with E being "conscience", which is his own reason. So if Cicero argues that we should follow our own reason, then E is the answer. But wait, I thought he said we should follow the self-interest of our own reason. So maybe the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I thought the question was about which option represents Cicero's stance. So the correct answer is probably E: follow our conscience. Or am I getting this mixed up with another point?

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F: follow the laws. Because he might say we should follow the laws as they are, but that's more of an authoritative approach, not a moral one.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Another approach: in his "On the Virtues," he discusses self-love as the highest virtue, which is self-interest. So if the question is about what to follow, it's self-interest. So the answer would be E: follow our conscience. No, wait, E is about self-interest. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F: follow the laws, but I think that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: follow our conscience. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps I should recall that Cicero said that we should follow the self-interest of our own reason, which is the idea behind E. But wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, following the laws. But that seems incorrect because he doesn't believe in external laws.

Wait, another angle: the options are about what to do. If Cicero says we should follow the self-interest of our own reason, then the answer is about our own reason. So E: follow our conscience. Because "conscience" is self-interest.

Wait, but no, E is about self-interest, not about following our reason. Wait, that's my confusion. "Conscience" is self-interest, but "conscience" is the self-interest. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but that doesn't make sense because E is a statement about self-interest, not a method.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The question is about what Cicero would argue. I think he would argue against following external factors, so the answer is F: follow the laws. No, that's not right. 

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me think of the options again. The question is about the argument Cicero would make. So if he says that we should not follow any external factors, which options are about external factors?

Looking at the options:

A: follow religious edicts — external.

B: historical precedents — external.

C: philosophical teachings — external.

D: follow nature — external.

E: follow conscience — internal, self-interest.

F: follow laws — external.

G: follow personal desires — internal.

H: follow instinct — internal.

I: follow societal norms — external.

J: follow friends and family — internal.

Wait, so external factors are A, B, C, D, E is internal (self-interest), F, H, I, J are internal. So Cicero's argument would be about not following external factors.

So the options about external factors (A to E) are the ones that are external. So the correct answer would be E: follow our conscience. But wait, E is about self-interest, which is internal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. The question is about which option represents his stance. So if he says we should follow our own reason (E), and that's internal, then the correct answer is E. But if he says we should follow the self-interest of our reason, then it's E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of another way. I remember that Cicero's famous phrase is about acting for oneself, not external forces. So the answer would be E: follow our conscience as the self-interest.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: maybe the correct answer is F: follow the laws. But I think that's not Cicero's stance. He doesn't believe in following external laws.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: follow our conscience.

Wait, to conclude, I think the correct answer is E: follow our conscience. Because Cicero would say that we should follow the self-interest of our own reason, which is E.

The correct answer is **E: follow our conscience**. Cicero argued that we should act for our own reason, rather than external factors. This aligns with his belief in self-interest, which he emphasized over external guidance.

Answer: E
