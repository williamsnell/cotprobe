Okay, so I have this quartic equation: x⁴ - 18x³ + kx² + 200x - 1984 = 0. I need to find the value of k. The problem states that the product of two of the four roots is -32. Hmm, quartic equations can be tricky, but I remember something about Vieta's formulas which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

Let me recall Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation. For a general quartic equation x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -a, the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is b, the sum of the products three at a time is -c, and the product of all four roots is d.

Wait, in our case, the equation is x⁴ - 18x³ + kx² + 200x -1984 =0. So, comparing, a = -18, b =k, c=200, d=-1984.

So, the sum of the roots (let's call them r1, r2, r3, r4) is -a = 18. The sum of products two at a time is b =k. The sum of products three at a time is -c = -200. The product of all four roots is d = -1984.

Now, the problem says that the product of two of the roots is -32. Let's say that r1 * r2 = -32. I need to find k, which is the sum of all such products two at a time.

But wait, how can I find k? I have the product of two roots, but I don't know the others. Maybe I can factor the quartic equation into two quadratics? Because if I can factor it as (x² + p x + q)(x² + r x + s), then perhaps I can find p, q, r, s. Then, the sum of products two at a time would involve p + r, p s + q r, etc.

Wait, but maybe there's a better approach. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that if two roots multiply to -32, then I can express the quartic as (x² - (sum of these two roots)) * (x² - (sum of other two roots)) * (x² - (some other terms)). But that might get complicated.

Wait, another approach: since the product of two roots is -32, let me write that as r1*r2 = -32. Since the product of all four roots is -1984, that implies that the product of the other two roots is (-1984)/(r1*r2) = (-1984)/(-32) = 62.

So, r3*r4 =62.

So, the roots can be grouped into two pairs: (r1, r2) with product -32, and (r3, r4) with product 62.

Now, the quartic can be factored into (x² - (r1 + r2)x -32)(x² - (r3 + r4)x +62) =0.

Wait, but does that hold? Let me check the signs. The quartic is x⁴ -18x³ +k x² +200x -1984.

If we factor into two quadratics: (x² + a x + b)(x² + c x + d) = x⁴ + (a + c)x³ + (ac + b + d)x² + (ad + bc)x + b d.

Comparing to our quartic, which is x⁴ -18x³ +k x² +200x -1984, we have:

a + c = -18 (from x³ term)
ac + b + d = k (from x² term)
ad + bc = 200 (from x term)
b d = -1984 (constant term)

But from the problem, we know that r1*r2 = -32, so let's say that b = -32 and d =62, because r3*r4 =62. Wait, because in the quartic, the constant term is b d. So if I take b = -32 and d =62, then b*d = (-32)(62) = -1984, which matches the constant term. So that's correct.

So, now, let me write down all the equations:

1. a + c = -18 (from x³ term)
2. a c + (-32) + 62 = k ⇒ a c +30 =k
3. a*62 + c*(-32) = 200 ⇒ 62 a -32 c = 200
4. b d = (-32)(62) = -1984, which is correct.

So, now, equation 3: 62a -32c =200.

Equation 1: a + c = -18.

So, from equation 1, c = -18 -a.

Substitute c into equation 3: 62a -32*(-18 -a) =200.

Let me compute that:

62a + 32*(18 +a) =200.

Wait, 62a -32*(-18 -a) =62a + 32*(18 + a) =200.

Compute 32*(18 +a) = 576 +32a.

So, equation becomes: 62a +576 +32a =200.

Adding 62a and 32a gives 94a.

So, 94a +576 =200.

Subtract 576: 94a = 200 -576 = -376.

So, a = -376 /94.

Calculate that: 94 ×4=376, so a= -4.

So, a is -4.

Then from equation 1: c = -18 - a = -18 - (-4) = -14.

So, a =-4, c= -14.

Now, from equation 2: a c +30 =k.

So, a c = (-4)*(-14) =56.

So, k=56 +30=86.

Wait, but let me double-check that.

Wait, equation 2: a c + (-32) +62 =k → a c +30 =k.

So, a c is (-4)*(-14)=56. 56 +30=86. So, yes, k=86.

Looking at the options, option C is 86. So the answer should be C.

The quartic equation is factored into two quadratics, with roots grouped such that two roots multiply to -32 and the other two multiply to 62. Using Vieta's formulas and solving the system of equations, the value of k is determined to be 86.
