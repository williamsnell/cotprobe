Okay, so I have this insurance question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again. 

Mr. Green is 35 years old, bought a new car, which has a symbol 5 and is kept in 06 territory. He had one accident in the last three years. The question is about the difference between $50-deductible and $100-deductible collision insurance if he uses the car for business. The options are from A to J, with some numbers.

Hmm, so I remember that collision insurance policies have different deductibles. Let me try to recall. So, the standard collision coverage is usually $500, but wait, I think in some regions it's higher. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, in the U.S., I think the standard is $500, but sometimes it's $1000. But the options here don't have $500, so maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the symbols and territories. The car is symbol 5, territory 06. So that's zone 5 in territory 6. But how does that affect the insurance? I think the symbol and territory determine the coverage limits, not the deductibles per se, but maybe the coverage limits. Wait, wait, no. The coverage limits are the maximum coverage you can get. So for symbolic 5, which I think is zone 5, the coverage might be a certain amount. But the question is about the deductibles.

Wait, the question is about the difference between $50-deductible and $100-deductible. So, the structure here is that the insurance policy allows you to deduct up to a certain amount. So, for example, if the policy is $500, you can deduct $500. But if the policy is $50, you can only deduct up to $50.

Wait, but in the U.S., I think the standard collision coverage is $500, but I've also heard that in some places, it's $1000. But the options don't include those numbers, so maybe it's a different structure. Hmm, maybe the problem is not about the actual coverage limits but the deductibles.

Wait, another thought: maybe the type of coverage affects the deductibles. Like, $50-deductible and $100-deductible policies. So, perhaps the difference is $50. But that doesn't seem to fit. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think again. The question is about the difference in cost between the two types of deductibles. So, which is cheaper, the $50-deductible or the $100-deductible? Well, the higher the deductible, the cheaper the insurance because you pay less out of pocket. So, a $100-deductible would mean you only have to pay $100 out of pocket if you have an accident, whereas a $50-deductible would require paying $50. So the $100-deductible is better. The difference between the two is $50. So the answer would be $50, which is option C.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not missing any nuance here. Let me think again. The problem says "what is the difference in cost between $50-deductible and $100-deductible collision insurance." So cost here refers to the amount the insurance company collects as premiums versus the out-of-pocket costs for the policyholder. So, for the $100-deductible, the company pays $100 per accident, but the policyholder only pays up to $100. For the $50, the company would pay $50, and the policyholder pays up to $50. So, the difference in what you pay is $50. Therefore, the insurance company saves $50 for each accident, which could be the difference in cost from the perspective of the policyholder.

Wait, but the question is about the difference in cost between the two policies. So the cost here is the premium paid. The question is about the difference in cost, so which is cheaper. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think differently. Suppose the policy is $500. If it's a $50-deductible, the policyholder only pays $500 - $50 = $450. If it's a $100-deductible, the policyholder pays $400. So the difference in what the policyholder pays is $50. But the question is about the difference in cost between the two policies, which I think refers to the premium. But the problem doesn't give any information about the premium, so maybe it's asking about the difference in the policy's structure, not the premium. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick. If the car's coverage is $500, but the deductibles are $50 vs $100. Wait, but the problem doesn't state the coverage limits. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the difference in the policy's structure, like the deductible amount. But the question says $50 vs $100-deductible. So the difference is $50. So the answer would be option C, $50.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the problem is about the insurance cost when using the car for business, but that's not changing the policy's deductibles. The question is about the difference in cost between the two types of policies when used for business.

Wait, but I'm stuck. I'll try to think of it another way. When Mr. Green buys collision insurance, the standard is a certain amount. Let's say the insurance has a $500 limit. If it's $50-deductible, the policyholder only pays up to $50. If it's $100-deductible, they pay up to $100. So if the policy is $500, the difference is $500 - $100 = $400. But the options don't have that, but maybe this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the insurance's cost per accident is higher. For example, if the standard is $500, the $50-deductible would cost the policyholder $500 - $50 = $450, whereas the $100-deductible would be $400. So the difference in what the policyholder pays is $50. So the difference in cost between the two policies is $50. So the answer is C.

Alternatively, the question is about the difference in the company's potential loss. The company pays $50 more per accident with the $100-deductible than the $50. So the difference for each accident is $50. So the total difference would be $50. So the answer is C.

I think I'm going in circles. I'll go with option C, $50.

The question asks for the difference in cost between $50-deductible and $100-deductible collision insurance for Mr. Green. The key point is that the deductible amount directly affects the policyholder's out-of-pocket cost. A $100-deductible policy would result in a smaller out-of-pocket payment compared to a $50-deductible policy, with the difference being $50. 

Answer: C
