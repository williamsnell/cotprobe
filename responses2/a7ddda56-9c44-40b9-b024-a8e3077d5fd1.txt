Okay, so I need to figure out who the first American president to visit communist China was. Hmm, I remember that there have been some significant visits between the US and China, especially in the late 20th century. Let me think about the key presidents and their diplomatic trips.

First, I recall that Richard Nixon was a famous president. I think he did some diplomatic work. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if he went to China. Let me think about the order. John F. Kennedy was the 32nd president, right? I remember that he visited China a few years back. Was that before or after other presidents?

Dwight Eisenhower, the 41st president, was a big name in the Cold War. I think he went to China before the Cold War ended. Then Jimmy Carter, the 33rd president, came in the late 70s. He was a US former president, so he was active in US diplomacy. Bill Clinton was the 43rd president and came after Carter, so I don't think she visited before him.

Looking at the options, the first ones are Nixon, Kennedy, Eisenhower, Carter, and then Johnson, Ford, Reagan, Bush, and finally Clinton. I believe the first visit was by John F. Kennedy. Let me confirm that. Oh right, I remember that Kennedy made history with a trip to China in the late 70s. He visited a series of countries, including the Soviet Union. So he was the first American president to go to a communist country.

I think the other options are the later presidents. So the answer should be B, John F. Kennedy.
