Okay, so I've got this equation here: v minus 26 equals 68. I need to find the value of v. Hmm, let's think about how to solve this. 

Alright, the equation is v - 26 = 68. I remember that to solve for a variable, I need to isolate it on one side. So, in this case, I have v minus 26, so I need to get rid of that 26 that's being subtracted. 

What's the opposite of subtracting 26? Oh right, addition. So I should do the same operation to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced. So if I add 26 to both sides, that should help.

Let me write that down. Starting with v - 26 = 68. If I add 26 to both sides, it becomes v - 26 + 26 = 68 + 26. 

Simplifying the left side: -26 and +26 cancel each other out, leaving just v. So now it's v = 68 + 26.

Now I need to calculate 68 plus 26. Let's do that. 60 plus 20 is 80, and 8 plus 6 is 14, so 80 plus 14 is 94. So v equals 94.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is 78, option I is 42, D is 96, H is 102, etc. Hmm, I got 94, but none of the options is exactly 94 except J is 78. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Oh, wait, did I add 68 and 26 correctly? Let me add again. 68 plus 20 is 88, plus 6 is 94. Yep, that's right. So v is 94.

Looking back at the options, J is 78. Hmm, that's not 94. Did I miscalculate something? Wait, maybe I misread the equation. Let me check again. The equation is v - 26 = 68. Oh wait, perhaps I should subtract instead? No, no, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the signs. Let me solve again. v - 26 = 68. So v = 68 + 26. 68 plus 26 is 94. So that's correct. So v is 94. But none of the options seem to have that. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, what's 68 plus 26 again? Let me do it step by step. 68 + 20 is 88, then add 6, which makes 94. So yes, 94. So the correct answer should be 94, but that's not among the options. Wait, looking at the options, J is 78, which is 68 minus 26. Oh wait, maybe I confused the signs. Let me think.

Wait, the equation is v minus 26 equals 68. So v is 26 more than 68. So 68 + 26 is 94. So v is 94. But the options don't have 94 as an option. Oh wait, looking again, option D is 96, which is 2 more than 94. Did I add 26 as 20 and 6? Or perhaps I should check if I added 68 and 26 correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the equation differently.

Wait another approach. Let me subtract 26 from v to get 68. So v must be 68 + 26. Wait, that's the same as before. So 68 + 26 is 94. So I'm confident that's correct. Hmm, but the options don't have 94. Oh, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again.

Options: A)84, B)-42, C)88, D)96, E)94, F)112, G)-94, H)102, I)42, J)78.

So E is 94. Oh wait, wait! Oh! Wait a second. My calculation says v is 94, which is option E. But earlier I thought the options didn't have that. Wait, no, E is 94, right? So maybe I made a mistake earlier in my thinking. Let me double-check.

Wait, the equation is v -26 =68. So adding 26 to both sides, we get v=68+26=94. So yes, option E is 94, which is correct. So why did I think J was the answer earlier? Because I might have miscalculated. Alternatively, perhaps I thought the equation was v +26 =68, which would give v=42, but no, the equation is v-26=68.

Wait another thing. Did I read the equation correctly? The equation is v minus 26 equals 68. So v -26 =68. So solving v gives 94. Which is option E. So the correct answer should be E, 94.

The equation is v - 26 = 68. To solve for v, add 26 to both sides: v = 68 + 26 = 94. The correct answer is E, 94.

Answer: E
