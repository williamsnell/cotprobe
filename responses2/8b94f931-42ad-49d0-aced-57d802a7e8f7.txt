Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: 3 raised to the power of (x squared plus 4x plus 4) equals 9 raised to the power of (x plus 2). Hmm, okay, let me write that down to visualize it better.

The equation is: 3^{x² + 4x + 4} = 9^{x + 2}. Hmm, both sides have powers of 3, right? So maybe I can rewrite 9 as 3 squared. That seems like a good first step because then both sides would have the same base, and I can set the exponents equal to each other.

So, 9 is 3 squared, so 9^{x + 2} is the same as (3²)^{x + 2}. Using exponent rules, when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So that becomes 3^{2*(x + 2)} which is 3^{2x + 4}. 

Now, the original equation becomes 3^{x² + 4x + 4} = 3^{2x + 4}. Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So:

x² + 4x + 4 = 2x + 4.

Okay, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me move everything to one side to solve for x. Subtract 2x and 4 from both sides:

x² + 4x + 4 - 2x - 4 = 0.

Simplifying that, the 4 and -4 cancel out, and 4x - 2x is 2x. So it becomes:

x² + 2x = 0.

Hmm, this looks factorable. Let me factor out an x:

x(x + 2) = 0.

So, according to the zero product property, either x = 0 or x + 2 = 0. That gives me x = 0 or x = -2.

The question asks for the sum of all possible values of x. So I need to add these solutions together: 0 + (-2) = -2.

Looking at the options, choice C is -2. So that should be the answer.

The equation is solved by rewriting both sides with base 3, leading to the quadratic equation \(x² + 2x = 0\), which factors to \(x(x + 2) = 0\). The solutions are \(x = 0\) and \(x = -2\), and their sum is \(-2\).

Answer: C
