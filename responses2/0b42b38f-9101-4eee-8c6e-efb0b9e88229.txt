Okay, let's tackle this electrochemistry problem. So, the question is about finding the cell potential E for a given cell setup. The cell is Ag/AgCl/Cl^- on the anode and Ce^4+/Ce^3+ on the cathode. The potentials given are 0.2225 V for AgCl/Cl^- and 1.45 V for the Ce^4+/Ce^3+ couple.

Hmm, I remember that cell potential is calculated using the formula E = E_cathode - E_anode. But wait, I need to make sure about the standard reduction potentials. So, the standard potential for each half-cell is given.

Wait, the standard reduction potential for AgCl/Cl^- is 0.2225 V. But wait, I think I need to check if this is the standard reduction potential or the reverse. Because sometimes potentials can be negative. Oh right, the standard potential for a reaction is written as E°(cathode) - E°(anode), but wait no, the anode is where oxidation happens, so the potential for the anode is reversed (because it's the reverse reaction).

Wait, no, the way it's set up, the anode is the oxidation half-reaction. So Ag is being oxidized here. So the standard potential for the anode is the reverse of the Ag/AgCl/Cl^- standard potential. Let me think about the two half-cells.

Wait, the Ag/AgCl/Cl^- side is the anode. So the reaction here is oxidation. The standard potential for the anode is the reverse of the Ag/AgCl/Cl^- standard potential. So the E° for the anode (which is oxidation) would be the negative of 0.2225 V.

Wait, no. Because the standard potential given for AgCl/Cl^- is the reduction potential. So if the reaction is Ag/AgCl/Cl^- → something, but in this case, it's an oxidation. So the half-reaction at the anode is the reverse of that, so the E° would be the negative of the given value.

So E_anode (oxidation) is -0.2225 V. Then the E_cathode is the 1.45 V, which is for the Ce^4+/Ce^3+ couple.

So the cell potential E is E_cathode - E_anode. So that's 1.45 V minus (-0.2225 V) = 1.45 + 0.2225 = 1.6725 V. Hmm, that's about 1.67 V.

Wait but wait, I'm trying to remember the exact setup. Another way: the standard cell potential is E_cathode plus E_anode (but with the sign reversed for the anode). Alternatively, the formula is E_cell = E_cathode - E_anode, where E_anode is the standard reduction potential for the anode, but since it's oxidation, which is the reverse, it's subtracted.

Wait, more accurately, E_cell = E_cathode (reduction) - E_anode (reduction). But in this case, since the anode is undergoing oxidation, the cell potential calculation would be E_cathode - (E_anode_oxidation).

Wait, no, the standard cell potential is E_cathode (E° for cathode's reduction) minus E_anode (E° for anode's reduction). But wait, the anode is the site of oxidation, so the reduction potential for the anode will be subtracted as is, but since it's reversed, the E_anode actually becomes negative.

Wait, let me clarify. The standard cell potential is calculated as E_cathode (reduction) minus E_anode (reduction). Because E_anode is the potential for the anode's half-reaction as written as a reduction. However, since in this case, the anode undergoes oxidation, the actual potential for the anode's reduction is the negative of what it's given.

Wait, let me get this straight. The standard reduction potentials are given for each half-reaction. The anode is where oxidation occurs, so the potential for that half-reaction is the negative of what it would be for reduction.

So for the Ag/AgCl/Cl^- half-reaction, the E° is 0.2225 V (reduction). But since it's the anode, it's oxidation, so the E for that half-reaction (in terms of reduction) is 0.2225 V, but when considering it as a reduction, it's written as AgCl + e^- → Ag + Cl^-.

Wait, maybe I should write down the two half-reactions.

Anode (oxidation):
Ag(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + e^-
But wait, the Ag/AgCl/Cl^- is a bit more complex. Wait, the Ag/AgCl/Cl^- half-cell has Ag metal and AgCl as the anode. So the reaction is:

Ag(s) → Ag⁺(aq) + e^-
But the presence of Cl^- in solution is from AgCl, so the AgCl is a good conductor.

Wait, the actual Ag/AgCl/Cl^- half-reaction is: Ag(s) → AgCl(s) + e^- + Cl^-
But in standard conditions, the potential is given as 0.2225 V (reduction; E° = 0.2225 V). So when it's an oxidation, the E° for the anode (reduction) is the same, but since it's reversed, the actual potential used is negative.

So E_anode (as a reduction) is 0.2225 V. But since the cell is operating as oxidation, the E for the anode in the cell calculation is considered as negative. So when calculating E_cell = E_cathode - E_anode, E_anode is 0.2225 V, so E_cell = 1.45 V - 0.2225 V = 1.2275 V. Wait, that's about 1.23 V.

But wait, no, that can't be right because the options don't have 1.23 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A: 1.10 V

B: 0.75 V

C: 1.00 V

D: .9342 V

E: 1.45 V

F: -0.2225 V

G: 0.50 V

H: 0.33 V

I: 1.67 V

J: 1.23 V

So J is 1.23 V, which is close to 1.2275. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let's think again. The standard cell potential is calculated as E_cell = E_cathode (reduction) - E_anode (reduction).

But in the anode, the Ag/AgCl/Cl^- is undergoing oxidation. So the E° for the anode is the E° for its oxidation, which is the negative of its reduction potential.

So E_anode (as reduction) is 0.2225 V. So when calculating E_cell, it's E_cathode (1.45 V) minus E_anode (0.2225 V), so 1.45 - 0.2225 = 1.2275 V.

Looking at the options, J is 1.23 V, which is approximately 1.2275. So that would be option J.

But wait another way: let's write the two half-reactions, their potentials, and the cell reaction.

Anode (oxidation): Ag(s) → Ag+ + e−. But in this case, the Ag/AgCl/Cl− setup, so the actual reaction is AgCl(s) + e− → Ag(s) + Cl^−. The standard reduction potential for Ag+ + e− → Ag(s) is 0.2225 V (E°). So the oxidation reaction is the reverse, which would have E° of -0.2225 V as a reduction. But in the cell, we're considering the anode's potential as the E° for its reduction, but since it's undergoing oxidation, the effective E for that half-reaction in the cell is the negative of the given E°.

So for the cell, E_cell = E_cathode (reduction) - E_anode (reduction). But wait, no, the E_anode is the E° of the anode's reduction.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The cell's E is the sum of the cathode's E° (reduction) and the anode's E° (reduction, but as negative because it's oxidation). So E_cell = E_cathode (E°) - E_anode (E°).

So E_cell = 1.45 V - 0.2225 V = 1.2275 V. Which is approximately 1.23 V, which is option J.

So the correct answer is J: 1.23 V.

To determine the cell potential \( E \) for the given cell setup, we use the formula:

\[
E = E_{\text{cathode}} - E_{\text{anode}}
\]

where \( E_{\text{cathode}} \) is the standard reduction potential for the cathode half-cell, and \( E_{\text{anode}} \) is the standard reduction potential for the anode half-cell. However, since the anode undergoes oxidation, its potential is subtracted as is.

### Step 1: Identify the half-reactions and their potentials
- The anode involves the reaction \( \text{AgCl}(s) + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ag}(s) + \text{Cl}^-(aq) \), with a standard reduction potential \( E^\circ = 0.2225 \, \text{V} \).
- The cathode involves the reaction \( \text{Ce}^{4+}(aq) + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ce}^{3+}(aq) \), with a standard reduction potential \( E^\circ = 1.45 \, \text{V} \).

### Step 2: Adjust the anode potential for oxidation
Since the anode undergoes oxidation, the potential for its half-reaction as a reduction is \( E^\circ = 0.2225 \, \text{V} \). However, in the cell potential calculation, the anode's potential is used as is (since it is being oxidized).

### Step 3: Calculate the cell potential
Using the formula \( E = E_{\text{cathode}} - E_{\text{anode}} \):
\[
E = 1.45 \, \text{V} - 0.2225 \, \text{V} = 1.2275 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated cell potential \( 1.2275 \, \text{V} \) is approximately \( 1.23 \, \text{V} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
