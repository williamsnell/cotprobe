Alright, so I've got this integral problem to solve. The function f(x, y) is defined piecewise. It equals 1 minus x minus y when x plus y is less than or equal to 1, and zero otherwise. The region I is the square from (0,0) to (1,1). I need to find the integral of f over this region.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that integrating a function over a region involves breaking it down into parts where the function is defined differently. In this case, the function changes at the line x + y = 1. That line divides the square into two regions: one where x + y ≤1 and the other where x + y >1.

So, the integral will be the sum of two integrals: one over the triangle where x+y ≤1, and another over the rest of the square.

First, let's find the area where x + y ≤1. That's a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1). The integral over this region will be the double integral of (1 - x - y) dx dy over that triangle.

Alternatively, since the region is a right triangle, we can compute it using geometry. The area of the triangle is (base * height)/2 = (1*1)/2 = 0.5. But that's just the area. The function is 1 - x - y, so integrating that over the triangle.

Wait, integrating 1 - x - y over the triangle. Let me set up the limits. For x from 0 to 1, and for y from 0 to (1 - x), since x + y ≤1. So, the integral becomes the double integral over x=0 to 1, y=0 to (1-x) of (1 - x - y) dy dx.

Let me compute this. First, integrate with respect to y. The inner integral is ∫(1 - x - y) dy from y=0 to y=1-x. The antiderivative with respect to y is (1 - x)y - (1/2)y². Evaluating from 0 to (1-x):

At y=1-x: (1-x)(1-x) - (1/2)(1-x)^2 = (1 - x)^2 - (1/2)(1 - x)^2 = (1/2)(1 - x)^2.

At y=0: 0.

So the inner integral evaluates to (1/2)(1 - x)^2.

Now, integrate that with respect to x from 0 to 1.

∫ (1/2)(1 - x)^2 dx from 0 to 1.

Let me substitute u = 1 - x, so du = -dx. When x=0, u=1; x=1, u=0.

So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ u² (-du) from u=1 to u=0.

Which is (1/2) ∫ u² du from 0 to 1. Because flipping the limits removes the negative sign.

∫ u² du is (u³)/3, so evaluating from 0 to1: (1/3)/3 = 1/3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, (1/2) * [ (1^3)/3 - 0 ] = (1/2)*(1/3) )= 1/6.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check my substitution again.

Wait, the integral is (1/2) ∫ u² du from u=1 to u=0. But since the limits are reversed, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ from 0 to1 u² du. Which is (1/2)*(1/3) )= 1/6. Hmm, but I thought the area of the triangle is 0.5, and the average value of the function would be 1/2 times the area, which would be 0.5*0.5 = 0.25. But according to the integral calculation, it's 1/6. That doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integral setup. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the integral of (1 - x - y) over the triangle.

Alternatively, note that the function is symmetric in x and y, so perhaps using a substitution like u = x + y, v = x - y. But maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, another method: in the triangle x + y ≤1, the function is 1 - x - y. So the integral over this region is the same as the integral of (1 - a - b) over the simplex a + b ≤1, where a and b are variables in [0,1]^2.

I remember that for such a region, the integral of (1 - a - b) over the simplex is (1/6). Because the integral is the same as the volume under the plane 1 - a - b over the triangle, which is a simplex. Alternatively, the integral can be computed by switching to variables u = a + b and v = a - b, but perhaps it's easier to use symmetry.

Alternatively, the integral can be thought of as the volume of the tetrahedron formed by the plane 1 - x - y = z. But perhaps integrating in terms of x and y is better.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the integral using geometry. The function is 1 - x - y over the triangle, which is a plane. The integral is the volume under this plane over the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute it as a double integral.

Wait, let me check again the integral I set up earlier. The integral is ∫ (from y=0 to y=1 - x) ∫ (from x=0 to x=1) (1 - x - y) dx dy.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in this setup, for each x, y goes from 0 to 1 - x. So the integration order is dy dx.

Wait, but when I integrated with respect to y first, I got 1/6. Alternatively, perhaps I should integrate with respect to x first.

Let me try that. For a fixed y, x goes from 0 to 1 - y.

So the integral is ∫ (from y=0 to 1) [ ∫ (from x=0 to 1 - y) (1 - x - y) dx ] dy.

Let me compute the inner integral first: ∫ (1 - x - y) dx from x=0 to x=1 - y.

The antiderivative is (1 - y)x - (1/2)x² evaluated from 0 to 1 - y.

At x = 1 - y: (1 - y)(1 - y) - (1/2)(1 - y)^2 = (1 - y)^2 - (1/2)(1 - y)^2 = (1/2)(1 - y)^2.

At x=0: 0.

So the inner integral is (1/2)(1 - y)^2.

Now integrate this with respect to y from 0 to 1.

So ∫ (1/2)(1 - y)^2 dy from 0 to1.

Let u = 1 - y, du = -dy, so when y=0, u=1; y=1, u=0.

The integral becomes (1/2) ∫ u² (-du) from u=1 to u=0, which is (1/2) ∫ u² du from 0 to1, which is (1/2)*(1^3/3) )= 1/6.

Wait, so the integral over the triangle is 1/6.

Then, the other region is the area where x + y >1 in the square. The function is zero there, so the integral over that region is zero.

Therefore, the total integral is 1/6 + 0 = 1/6, which is approximately 0.166666...

Looking at the options, that's option H: 0.16667.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the triangle's area is 1/2, and the average value of 1 - x - y over that triangle is (1/2)*(average value). Alternatively, the average value of 1 - x - y over the triangle is 1/3, since the integral is 1/6 and area is 1/2, so 1/6 divided by 1/2 is 1/3. Thus, average is 1/3, area 1/2, so 1/3 *1/2=1/6.

So yes, the integral over the triangle is 1/6, and the rest is zero, so the total is 1/6.
</think>

The integral of f(x, y) over the region I is the double integral of (1 - x - y) over the triangle x + y ≤1, which evaluates to 1/6. Since the function is zero elsewhere, the total integral is 1/6, corresponding to option H.

Answer: H
