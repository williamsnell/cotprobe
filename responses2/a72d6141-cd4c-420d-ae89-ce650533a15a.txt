Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see, it's about neutralization reactions. Hmm. I remember that neutralization involves an acid reacting with a base to form water and a salt. The reaction between H3PO4 and Ca(OH)2 must be the key here.

Wait, H3PO4 is phosphoric acid, and Ca(OH)2 is calcium hydroxide. I think they form a salt and water. So the balanced equation would show H3PO4 reacting with Ca(OH)2 to produce Ca3(PO4)2 and water. Let me try to write that down.

The general formula for acid-base reactions is acid + base → salt + water. So, H3PO4 has a +3 charge, and Ca(OH)2 each has a -2 charge. So the neutralization reaction should balance the charges. Let me think about the stoichiometry.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, but in neutralization, I think it will react with the OH- ions. Let me find the mole ratio. For every mole of H3PO4, how many moles of Ca(OH)2 react?

Wait, each H3PO4 molecule can donate three H+ ions. But Ca(OH)2 has two OH- ions per formula unit. So, the reaction would require 2 H3PO4 to react with 3 Ca(OH)2. Because for each H3PO4, it can donate 3 H+ ions, so 2 H3PO4 would give 6 H+ ions. Ca(OH)2 has 2 OH- ions, so 6 H+ ions would react with 3 Ca(OH)2 (each gives 2 OH-). So the mole ratio is 2 H3PO4 : 3 Ca(OH)2.

Alternatively, the balanced equation is:

2 H3PO4 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → Ca3(PO4)2 + 6 H2O.

Wait, let me verify that. Each H3PO4 has 3 H+ and a -3 charge. Each Ca(OH)2 has 2 OH- and a -2 charge. So, 2 H3PO4 would have 6 H+ ions. 3 Ca(OH)2 gives 6 OH- ions. So the H+ and OH- would neutralize to 6 H2O. So the equation balances. So 2 moles of H3PO4 react with 3 moles of Ca(OH)2.

So, the mole ratio is 2 : 3. So for every 2 moles of H3PO4, we need 3 moles of Ca(OH)2.

Now, the problem gives me the concentrations and volumes of each solution. I need to find the volume of H3PO4 needed to neutralize 25 ml of 0.030 M Ca(OH)2.

So first, calculate the moles of Ca(OH)2 in the solution. Molarity is moles per liter, so moles = M × L.

Moles of Ca(OH)2 = 0.030 mol/L * 0.025 L = 0.00075 mol.

Wait, wait. 0.030 M is 0.03 mol per liter. 25 ml is 0.025 liters. So 0.03 * 0.025 = 0.00075 mol. Yes.

From the mole ratio, 2 moles of H3PO4 react with 3 moles of Ca(OH)2. So the ratio is (H3PO4) / (Ca(OH)2) = 2/3.

So, moles of H3PO4 = (2/3) * moles of Ca(OH)2.

Plugging in the numbers: (2/3)* 0.00075 mol = 0.0005 mol. So 0.0005 moles of H3PO4 are needed.

Wait, wait. Let me check the calculations again. H3PO4 is the acid, and Ca(OH)2 is the base. So the acid is in the reactant, the base is the reactant too.

So, the moles of H3PO4 needed is (2/3) * moles of Ca(OH)2.

Moles of Ca(OH)2 is 0.030 M × 0.025 L = 0.00075 mol.

So, moles of H3PO4 = (2/3)*0.00075 = 0.0005 mol.

Wait, no, wait. Because the ratio is 2 H3PO4 to 3 Ca(OH)2. So, for each 3 moles of Ca(OH)2, you need 2 moles of H3PO4. So, when you have a certain number of Ca(OH)2 moles, you need (2/3) times that.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think in terms of the balanced equation.

The balanced equation is 2 H3PO4 + 3 Ca(OH)2 → Ca3(PO4)2 + 6 H2O.

So, from this, 2 moles of H3PO4 react with 3 moles of Ca(OH)2.

So, the mole ratio is 2:3.

So, moles of H3PO4 needed = (2/3) × moles of Ca(OH)2.

We have 0.00075 moles of Ca(OH)2. So,

moles H3PO4 = (2/3) * 0.00075 = 0.0005 mol.

Now, the concentration of H3PO4 is 0.025 M. So, the volume (in liters) is moles / concentration.

Volume = 0.0005 mol / 0.025 M = 0.02 L. Which is 20 ml.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm the calculations. 0.030 M × 0.025 L = 0.00075 mol Ca(OH)2.

2/3 * 0.00075 is 0.0005 mol H3PO4 needed.

Molarity of H3PO4 is 0.025 M. So volume = 0.0005 / 0.025 = 0.02 L → 20 ml.

Looking at the options, option H is 20 ml. So the answer should be H: 20ml.

To determine the volume of 0.025 M H₃PO₄ required to neutralize 25 ml of 0.030 M Ca(OH)₂, we start by analyzing the chemical reaction:

\[
\text{H₃PO₄ + Ca(OH)₂ → Ca₃(PO₄)₂ + 6 H₂O}
\]

From the balanced equation, 2 moles of H₃PO₄ react with 3 moles of Ca(OH)₂. The mole ratio is \( \frac{\text{H₃PO₄}}{\text{Ca(OH)₂}} = \frac{2}{3} \).

First, calculate the moles of Ca(OH)₂ in the solution:
\[
\text{Moles of Ca(OH)₂} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.030 \, \text{M} \times 0.025 \, \text{L} = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Using the mole ratio, calculate the moles of H₃PO₄ needed:
\[
\text{Moles of H₃PO₄} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Moles of Ca(OH)₂} = \frac{2}{3} \times 0.00075 = 0.0005 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Next, calculate the volume of H₃PO₄ required using its molarity:
\[
\text{Volume of H₃PO₄} = \frac{\text{Moles of H₃PO₄}}{\text{Molarity}} = \frac{0.0005 \, \text{mol}}{0.025 \, \text{M}} = 0.02 \, \text{L} = 20 \, \text{ml}.
\]

Thus, the volume of 0.025 M H₃PO₄ required to neutralize 25 ml of 0.030 M Ca(OH)₂ is **20 ml**.
