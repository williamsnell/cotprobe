Okay, so I need to find the percentage discount offered on a watch. The list price is $300, and the net price is $174. Hmm, I remember that percentage discount is calculated based on the difference between the list price and the net price, then divided by the list price, and then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

Let me write down the formula to make sure I get it right. Percentage discount = [(List Price - Net Price) / List Price] * 100. So, plugging in the numbers, that would be (300 - 174) divided by 300, then times 100.

First, calculate the difference: 300 - 174. Let me subtract that. 174 from 300. 300 minus 174 is 126. So the discount amount is $126.

Now, divide that by the list price, which is $300. So 126 divided by 300. Let me compute that. 126 รท 300. Hmm, I can simplify that. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 6. 126 รท6 is 21, and 300 รท6 is 50. So it's 21/50.

21 divided by 50 equals 0.42. To get the percentage, multiply by 100, so 0.42 * 100 = 42%. So the discount is 42%.

Looking at the options provided, option B is 42%, which matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be B.

The discount is calculated as (List Price - Net Price) / List Price * 100. 

- List Price = $300
- Net Price = $174
- Difference = $300 - $174 = $126
- Percentage Discount = (126 / 300) * 100 = 42%

**Answer: B: 42%**

Answer:
     B: 42%
