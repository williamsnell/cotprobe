Question:

Suppose a stock has the following information. It is listed on the London stock exchange and operates throughout Europe. The yield on a UK 10 year treasury is 2.8%. The stock in question will earn 8.6% as per historical data. The Beta for the stock is 1.4, i.e., it is 140% volatile to the changes in the general stock market. What is the expected rate of return?

Options:

A: 5.6
B: 2.8
C: 1.4
D: 10.92
E: 7.98
F: 6.2
G: 9.4
H: 8.6
I: 11.76
J: 12.34

Okay, so I have this question about expected rate of return for a stock. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, where do I start?

The question says the stock has a historical return of 8.6%. The UK 10-year Treasury yield is 2.8%. The Beta is 1.4. So, Beta measures volatility relative to the market. I remember that the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is used to find the expected return. Does that apply here? Oh right, CAPM is often used to estimate the expected return of an asset.

Wait, the formula for CAPM is: Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). So, the risk-free rate here would be the UK 10-year Treasury rate, which is 2.8%. Beta is 1.4, and the market return is the same as the yield given, 2.8%. Hmm, wait, that can't be right because if the market return equals the risk-free rate, then Beta times (Market - Risk-Free) would be zero. So the expected return would just be the risk-free rate.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is: E(R) = Rf + Beta*(Rm - Rf). So plugging in the numbers:

E(R) = 2.8% + 1.4*(2.8% - 2.8%) = 2.8%. So the expected return would be 2.8%.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.8. But wait, the stock returns 8.6% as historical data. I thought the CAPM is an expected return, not historical. So the question might be asking using CAPM to calculate the expected return, not the historical return.

So the expected return would be 2.8%. But wait, none of the options are 2.8 except B. But wait, sometimes CAPM might use the market's expected return or historical return? I think CAPM uses the expected market return, which here is 2.8%. So the expected return is 2.8% as per CAPM.

Wait, but why is the stock's return 8.6%? Oh, perhaps the question is just asking for the expected return, not the historical. So the answer is 2.8%, which is option B.

But wait, another possibility: some people might confuse historical return with expected. But the question is asking for the expected rate of return, so I think it's 2.8% as per CAPM. So the answer is B.
</think>

To determine the expected rate of return for the stock using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), we apply the formula:

\[ \text{Expected Return} = R_f + \beta \times (R_m - R_f) \]

Where:
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate (2.8%).
- \( \beta \) is the stock's Beta (1.4).
- \( R_m \) is the expected market return (2.8%).

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Expected Return} = 2.8\% + 1.4 \times (2.8\% - 2.8\%) = 2.8\% \]

Thus, the expected rate of return is 2.8%, which corresponds to option B.

**Answer: B**
