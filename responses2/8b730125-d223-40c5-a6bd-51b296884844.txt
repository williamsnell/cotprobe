Okay, so I have this economics problem here about a train set company. The question has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's see what I can figure out.

First, part (a): I need to find the profit function and determine how many units to produce to maximize profit. The cost per train set is $10, and the demand function is given as p = 90 - 0.02x, where x is the number sold and p is the price retailers pay.

Hmm, I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So I'll start by figuring out revenue. Revenue is price multiplied by quantity, which would be R = p * x. Since p is 90 - 0.02x, substituting that in, R = (90 - 0.02x) * x = 90x - 0.02x².

Now, total cost. The company makes each set for $10, so if they make x sets, the cost is 10x. So, the total cost (TC) is 10x.

Then, profit (π) is revenue minus cost: π = (90x - 0.02x²) - 10x. Simplifying that, 90x -10x is 80x, so π = 80x - 0.02x². That's the profit function.

But wait, I think I should write it in terms of x, which is the number of units made. So, π(x) = -0.02x² +80x.

To maximize profit, I need to find the value of x that gives the maximum point. Since this is a quadratic function opening downward (because the coefficient of x² is negative), the maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). 

In this case, a = -0.02 and b = 80. So, x = -80/(2*(-0.02)) = -80 / (-0.04) = 2000. So, 2000 units should be produced to maximize profit.

So part (a) gives a profit function π(x) = -0.02x² +80x, and the optimal x is 2000.

Wait, but the options don't have 2000 as the number of sets. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 3000
B:2200
C:1200
D:1600
E:2500
F:1800
G:1500
H:2000
I:1000
J:3500.

Ah, option H says 2000 sets. So that's the x value for part (a). And the amount of units to make is 2000.

Now part (b) asks what price retailers pay for each set. Using the demand function p = 90 - 0.02x. Plugging x =2000 into this equation:

p = 90 - 0.02*(2000) = 90 -40 =50. So the price is $50.

Wait, but looking at the options, which one has 2000 sets and a price of $50? Let's see the options:

Option H says 2000 sets, $50 price. So that's the correct choice.

But wait, let me double-check everything. Did I make any mistakes? Let's go through again.

Profit function: R = p*x = (90 -0.02x)x = 90x -0.02x². Correct.

TC is 10x, so profit is 90x -0.02x² -10x =80x -0.02x². Correct.

Vertex at x=2000. So yes, 2000 is the correct number to produce for maximum profit.

And the price is 50, which is option H.

But wait, looking at the options again:

H says "2000 sets, $50, $60." So price is $50, which matches. So H is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options for the first part:

Each option has a number of sets and a profit, and a price.

For example, option H: 2000 sets, $50, $60.

So the profit would be π = -0.02*(2000)^2 +80*(2000) = -0.02*4,000,000 +160,000 = -80,000 +160,000 =80,000. So $80,000 profit.

But looking at the options, the amounts are given as profit or prices, not as the amount. So the profit function is the first part, and the question is to select the correct options for both parts.

So the correct answer is H: 2000 sets, $50 price.

So the options are:

H: 2000 sets, $50, $60.

Yes, that's correct.

The correct answer is H: 2000 sets, $50, $60.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Determine the Profit Function:**
   - **Revenue (R):** P = 90 - 0.02x, so R = (90 - 0.02x) * x = 90x - 0.02x².
   - **Total Cost (TC):** 10x.
   - **Profit (π):** π = R - TC = (90x - 0.02x²) - 10x = 80x - 0.02x².
   - **Vertex of the Parabola:** The profit function is a downward opening parabola, so the maximum occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -80/(2*(-0.02)) = 2000 sets.

2. **Determine the Retail Price:**
   - Substitute x = 2000 into p = 90 - 0.02x: p = 90 - 0.02(2000) = 90 - 40 = $50.

3. **Match to Options:**
   - Option H: 2000 sets, $50, $60. This matches the calculated values.

**Answer:** H: 2000 sets, $50, $60.
