Okay, so I'm trying to solve this insurance loss problem. Let's see. Adams Manufacturing Company had a fire loss of $45,000. They used two insurance companies to cover it. The amounts of their policies are Acme Insurance with a $50,000 policy and Safe Way Insurance with a $30,000 policy. Hmm, wait, that doesn't add up. Because the total loss was $45,000, but the sum of the policies is $50k + $30k = $80k. That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe the policies are the amounts they cover, not the total. So perhaps the policies are the amounts each company can cover. But then the loss is $45k. So each company would have to pay the maximum they can cover, but maybe there's a cap. Wait, no, I think in fire insurance, usually, each company can't cover more than the loss, but they might cover up to their policy's amount. But wait, if the loss is $45k, and one company only has a $50k policy, but the loss is 45k, then the company with the $50k policy would cover the entire $45k. Similarly, the $30k Safe Way would also cover the entire $45k because their policy is less than 45k. So both companies would have to pay their full policies' amounts. Wait, no. Because if the loss is more than one company's policy, but that's not possible because the loss is only $45k, which is less than both policies. Wait, the total loss is $45k, but the policies are Acme: $50k and Safe Way: $30k. So Acme's policy is $50k, which is more than the loss, so Acme would pay $45k. Safe Way's policy is $30k, which is less than the loss, so they have to pay the full $30k. Wait, but that can't be right because the total would then be $45k + $30k = $75k, which is more than the actual loss. So I must have misunderstood the problem. Wait, maybe the insurance policies are the amounts each company can cover, but they're only partially applied. Alternatively, perhaps the companies are covering different parts of the loss. Wait, maybe each company can only cover their own policy's amount. So the Acme would pay $45k (since that's the loss) because their policy is $50k, so the loss is covered up to $50k. But that leaves Safe Way's policy of $30k. Wait, no. Because the total loss is 45k, which is less than Acme's policy. So Acme would pay 45k, and Safe Way would pay their full 30k. But that adds up to 75k, which is way more than the loss. So that can't be right. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the insurance companies are covering the loss in a way that each can only cover their own policy. So if the loss is $45k, Acme's policy is $50k, so they can cover up to $50k, but the loss is $45k, so Acme pays $45k. Safe Way's policy is $30k, so they can pay up to $30k. But the loss is $45k, which is more than $30k, so the rest must be covered by another source. But wait, the problem states that the loss was covered by both companies. So the initial distribution is that each paid a certain amount. So perhaps the amounts paid by each company are such that each paid the amount of their policy covered by the loss.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the insurance companies covering the loss through their policies, but the total loss is $45k, so each company's contribution is their policy amount. But that can't be because if Acme's policy is $50k and the loss is $45k, Acme would pay $45k. Safe Way's policy is $30k, so they would have to pay the full $30k. But that would sum to $75k, which can't be right. So perhaps the problem is that the insurance companies only cover their portion of the loss up to their policies.

Wait, maybe this is a case of the insurance companies covering the loss in a way that each can only cover their portion. So the total loss is $45k, and each company's insurance covers up to their policy's amount. So Acme's policy is $50k, so they can cover up to $50k, but the loss is $45k, so Acme's payment is $45k. Safe Way's policy is $30k, so they can cover up to $30k, so their payment is $30k. But that would mean the total insurance coverage is $45k + $30k = $75k, but the loss is only $45k, so that can't be. Wait, perhaps the insurance coverage is based on the loss. So the insurance companies are each agreeing to cover the loss, but each company's policy caps their contribution to the loss. So the amount each company pays is the minimum of their policy and the loss. But that can't be the case because the sum would be more than the loss. Alternatively, perhaps each company is responsible for the portion of the loss that their policy can cover, but that's not how it works. Maybe the insurance companies are covering the loss in a way that each company pays their own portion up to their policy's limit, but the sum might not match the loss. But I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of each company's insurance covering the loss, but the sum of their payments should equal the loss. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the policies is $80k, which is more than $45k. So maybe each company pays the maximum they can, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the insurance companies are each paying the full amount of the loss, but that's not how it works either.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the insurance companies are each paying a share of the loss, but the shares are based on their policies. For example, the total loss is $45k, and each company is responsible for a portion proportional to their policy's size. So the proportion is Acme's policy (50k) / total (50+30=80k) = 50/80 = 5/8. So Acme's share is 5/8 * 45k = (5 * 45k)/8 = 225k/8 = 28125.

Similarly, Safe Way's share is 30/80 *45k = (3/8)*45k = 135k/8 = 16875.

So option D says Acme: $28,125, Safe Way: $16,875. That makes sense because 28125 + 16875 = 45k, which matches the loss. So the answer should be option D.

The problem involves determining how the fire loss of $45,000 was apportioned between two insurance companies, Acme Insurance and Safe Way Insurance, with policies of $50,000 and $30,000, respectively. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Total Insurance Coverage**: The sum of the policies is $50,000 + $30,000 = $80,000, which is more than the loss of $45,000. However, the apportionment must ensure that the total loss is fully covered, so the apportionment is based on the proportion of each company's policy relative to the total.

2. **Proportional Apportionment**:
   - **Acme Insurance**: Its portion is calculated as (50,000 / 80,000) * 45,000 = (5/8) * 45,000 = $28,125.
   - **Safe Way Insurance**: Its portion is (30,000 / 80,000) * 45,000 = (3/8) * 45,000 = $16,875.

3. **Total Apportionment**: $28,125 + $16,875 = $45,000, which matches the total loss.

### Correct Answer:
The correct apportionment is Acme Insurance paying $28,125 and Safe Way Insurance paying $16,875.
