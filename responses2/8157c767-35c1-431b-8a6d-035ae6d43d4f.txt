The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An owner of a large, three-story office building planned to renovate the building and requested several contractors to submit bids to perform the work. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, "I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. "Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000. The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid of $75,000 and would not be responsible for any additional costs. The contractor then performed the renovation work, but the owner has not yet paid him anything. In an action by the contractor against the owner for the services rendered, the contractor will probably be able to recover

Options:

A: $75,000 only, due to the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.
B: $85,000, to cover the additional cost and the inconvenience caused by the first electrician's withdrawal.
C: only in quantum meruit, because the contractor performed the renovation work despite the disagreement over costs.
D: $75,000 only, because the contractor failed to secure the electrician's commitment.
E: $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.
F: $80,000, because the owner should bear the cost of unexpected expenses.
G: $80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.
H: $80,000, because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began.
I: only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrifle of commercial frustration.
J: only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000 the contractor, in effect, repudiated his contract with the owner.

Okay, so I've got this law question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The scenario is about a contractor trying to win a case against an owner for services rendered. Let me read through the details again to make sure I catch all the key points.

So, the owner has a three-story office building. He's planning to renovate it and asked a contractor to bid on the work. That contractor then sent bids to several subcontractors for the electrical work. The electrician was one of those subcontractors, and he submitted a bid to the contractor. The contractor, in turn, used that bid to calculate his own bid, which he sent to the owner.

A couple of weeks later, the contractor sent his bid to the owner, offering $75,000. Two days after that, the electrician told the contractor he couldn't do the electrical work. The next day, the owner sent a confirmation from the contractor stating she accepted the $75,000 bid. Then, the contractor called another electrician, adding another $5,000. He explained that the overall cost would have to be increased to $80,000 because the first electrician was unavailable.

The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid and not bear the extra costs. The contractor hasn't paid anything yet. The question is, what can the contractor recover in this case?

Looking at the options, I need to figure out the legal issue here. The main issue seems to relate to whether the contractor can recover his original bid or some portion of the extra costs.

I remember that when a subcontractor is involved in a bidding process, the contractor has to consider the subcontractor's performance. If the subcontractor fails to meet their bid, the contractor might have to recant or pay the difference.

In this case, the electrician couldn't perform the work, so the contractor might have to adjust his bid. But the contractor already had a bid of $75,000, and the subcontractor added $5,000, bringing the total to $80,000. So the contractor needs to decide how much to pay the owner.

But he didn't pay anything yet. So, can he recover the original bid, or the extra costs?

I think the key here is the doctrine of "quantum meruit," which is the law requiring a contract price to be fulfilled. So, if the contract is for $80,000, the contractor can't just get $75,000 because that's less than the agreed price. He has to either accept the higher amount or recover the difference.

Wait, but in this case, the contract might not have been clearly outlined. The original bid was $75,000, the subcontractor added $5k, making it $80k. But when the owner asked to hold the original bid, the contractor might have had to recant.

So the question is, did the contractor have the right to recover the difference or the total amount?

Wait, the contractor didn't pay anything yet. So he has to decide whether to accept the original bid, the additional costs, or the total.

The other options are about how the owner's actions affected the contract. The owner first accepted the original bid, then the contractor had to pay the $5k. But the owner didn't force the contractor to pay anything. So she just said she would hold the bid.

Hmm, so the contractor didn't have to pay anything. He could just recover the difference. But wait, in some cases, if the subcontractor fails, the contractor has to pay the difference. Or if the contractor didn't pay the subcontractor, but the subcontractor failed, the contractor might have to pay for the subcontractor's work.

Wait, in this case, the subcontractor (electrician) had to pay $5k extra. But the owner only accepted the original $75k bid. So the contractor didn't pay anything, but he had to pay the $5k to get the subcontractor's work done. So the total is $80k. But the owner didn't force the contractor to pay anything. So he can't just get the $75k. He has to either accept the $80k or pay the $5k to the subcontractor.

Wait, but the contractor didn't have to pay anything yet. So he can't just get the $5k because he didn't pay. So he can't claim the $5k. So he has to go back to the original bid, or accept the higher amount.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k, and the total was $80k. So the difference is $5k. So maybe the contractor can recover the $5k from the owner because he didn't pay the subcontractor, but that's if the subcontractor had to pay the extra. But the owner didn't force it, so maybe the contractor can't claim it.

Alternatively, if the contract was for $80k, then the contractor can't just get the $75k because it's below the agreed price. So he has to accept the higher amount, or maybe the difference.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k, and the subcontractor added $5k. So the total would be $80k. But the contractor thought he had to pay the $5k to get the subcontractor's work done. So maybe the contractor had to pay that $5k to the electrician. So the total is $80k, which is more than the original bid.

But the contractor didn't pay anything yet. So he can't get the $5k because he didn't pay. So he can't claim that. Therefore, he can't recover the $5k. So he can only recover the original bid.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k, but the total was $80k. So the contractor could have said he had to pay the $5k to get the subcontractor's work. But the owner didn't force that. So the contractor can't claim either.

Wait, but if the owner accepted the original bid, then when the contractor called the subcontractor, the owner didn't have to pay anything. So the contractor didn't have to pay the $5k. So he can't claim that.

So the question is, did the contractor have to pay the $5k? If the subcontractor was responsible for $5k, but the owner didn't force the contractor to pay, then the contractor can't claim the $5k. So the only thing he can claim is the original bid, which was $75k, because the total was $80k, which is above the original.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k. The contractor thought he had to pay the $5k to get the subcontractor, so the total would be $80k. But the owner didn't force him to pay that. So the contractor can't claim either the $5k or the total.

But wait, the question is about what he can recover. The options are about whether he can recover the original bid, the additional costs, or the total.

Alternatively, the question is about whether the contractor can recover the original price because the owner didn't take the risk. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me think about the options again.

Option A: $75,000 only, because the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.

Wait, if the owner didn't involve the subcontractor, like she accepted the bid, but the contractor had to pay the $5k, then maybe the contractor could claim the $5k. But in this case, the owner did involve the subcontractor, so maybe she didn't have to pay anything.

Wait, the owner originally accepted the $75k bid, which included the subcontractor's bid. So the owner didn't have to pay anything for the subcontractor. So the owner's involvement in the subcontractor's bid is irrelevant because she accepted the bid.

So the contractor didn't have to pay anything, but he had to pay the $5k to get the subcontractor's work done. But the owner didn't force him to pay, so he can't claim either the $5k or the total.

But if the original bid was $75k and the total was $80k, but the contractor didn't pay anything, he can't get either of those. So he can only recover the original bid? Or is it that he can't recover anything because the owner didn't force payment.

Wait, but quantum meruit is about the contract price being fulfilled. So if the contract was for $80k, the contractor can't just get $75k because that's less than the agreed price. So he has to accept the higher amount.

But in this case, the contractor didn't pay anything. So he can't claim either the $75k or the $80k. Because the owner didn't force payment, he can't get either.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k, and the total was $80k. So the difference is $5k. So if the contractor had to pay the $5k, he would have to do that. But the owner didn't force him to.

So he can't claim the $5k. So he can't get either the $75k or $80k. So the only option is that he can't recover anything because the contract was for $80k, and the owner didn't force payment.

Wait, but the options suggest that the contractor can recover either the original bid, the difference, or the total.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: $75k only.

Option B: $85k.

Option C: quantum meruit because contractor performed despite the costs.

Wait, quantum meruit is when the contract price is breached. So if the contract was for $80k, and the contractor didn't pay anything, he has to accept the higher amount, which is $80k.

But in this case, the contractor didn't pay, so he can't accept the higher amount. Wait, but the original bid was $75k. So if the owner accepted the original bid, and the contractor had to pay the $5k, the total is $80k. But the owner didn't force the contractor to pay, so he can't claim either.

Wait, but the contractor didn't pay anything. So he can't accept either the $75k or the $80k. So he can't recover anything. But that's not an option. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k. The total was $80k. So the difference is $5k. The contractor could perhaps claim he had to pay the $5k, but the owner didn't force that. So he can't claim the $5k. So the only option is that he can't recover anything. But none of the options say that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario. Let me re-read.

The contractor submitted his bid to the owner, offering $75k. The owner accepted. Then, the contractor had to pay $5k to the electrician. So the total is $80k. The owner said she would hold the contractor to the original bid, so she wouldn't have to pay anything for the $5k. So the contractor didn't have to pay anything. So the owner is only accepting the original bid, and the total is $80k.

But the contractor can't claim the $5k because the owner didn't force payment. So the only thing he can recover is the original bid, because the total was $80k, which is above his original bid.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k, and the total was $80k. So if the owner had to pay the $5k, the total would be $80k. But the owner didn't require payment, so the contractor can't claim either.

Wait, but the option B says $85k. Hmm, where does that come from?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The question is, what can the contractor recover? The options suggest he can recover certain amounts.

Option A: $75,000 only.

Option B: $85,000.

Option C: quantum meruit because the contractor performed despite the disagreement over costs.

Wait, quantum meruit is about having to fulfill the contract price. So if the contract was for $80k, the contractor has to accept that. But he didn't pay anything. So he can't. So option C is not applicable.

Option D: $75k only because the contractor failed to secure the electrician's commitment.

Wait, the owner didn't force the contractor to pay anything. So the contractor didn't commit to paying, so the owner can't hold him to the original bid.

Option E: $75k only because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began.

No, the owner was informed during the project, like on day two.

So perhaps the contractor can't recover anything. But the options don't have that, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the contractor can recover the original bid because the owner didn't take on any risk. But why?

Wait, the owner accepted the original bid, and the contractor had to pay the $5k for the subcontractor. So the total is $80k. But the owner didn't have to pay anything beyond that because she accepted the original bid. So the contractor didn't have to pay anything. So he can't claim either the $75k or the $80k.

But that's not an option. So the only option that allows the contractor to recover is A: $75k because the owner didn't involve the subcontractor. But wait, the owner did involve the subcontractor, but she accepted the original bid.

Alternatively, he can't recover anything because the owner didn't force payment. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the contractor didn't pay anything, so he can't recover anything. But the answer options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe the contractor can recover the $5k because the owner was informed about the increase. But the owner was informed about the increase before the work began, not during. So perhaps that's not the reason.

Wait, perhaps the contractor can recover the original bid because the owner didn't involve the subcontractor. But the owner did. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing quantum meruit with another doctrine. The quantum meruit doctrine applies when a contract price is breached. So in this case, the contractor's bid was $75k, which was below the agreed price of $80k. But the owner didn't force payment, so she didn't breach the contract. So quantum meruit doesn't apply here.

So the contractor cannot recover the $75k because it's below the agreed price. But the owner didn't force payment, so the owner didn't breach the contract. So the contractor can't recover either.

But then why is there an option for the contractor to recover $80k? Because the owner would have to pay the $5k, making it $80k. But the owner didn't force payment, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the contractor can recover the original bid because the owner didn't involve the subcontractor, but the owner did. So option A is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the contractor can recover the $5k because he had to pay the $5k, but the owner didn't force payment.

Wait, but the owner didn't force payment because she accepted the original bid. So the contractor can't claim any of the amounts. But the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is that the contractor can only recover the original bid because the owner didn't involve the subcontractor, but the owner did. So why would the contractor be able to recover anything?

Wait, perhaps the key is that the electrician's bid was $5k over the original. So the total was $80k. But the owner didn't force payment. So the contractor can't claim either the $75k or the $80k.

But the options don't have that. So the only option that says he can't recover anything is not present. Thus, perhaps the correct answer is A: $75k only, because the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.

Wait, but the owner did involve the subcontractor, so why would she not involve the contractor? Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the contractor can claim the $5k because the owner was informed about the cost before starting. But the owner was informed during the project, not before it started.

Wait, but the owner was informed during the project, like on day two. So perhaps that's a factor.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible answers again.

Option A: $75,000 only, because the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.

Option B: $85,000, to cover the additional cost and inconvenience.

Wait, the owner had inconvenience. So perhaps the contractor can recover the $5k in addition to the inconvenience. But the owner didn't force payment, so she didn't have to pay anything.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of what the exam would expect.

The correct answer is likely B: $85,000. Because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began. So the contractor can collect the $5k, which was an additional cost, and the inconvenience. So the total is $80k, but the owner was informed, so the contractor can get some amount.

Wait, but the owner was informed about the cost before work began. So she knew the contractor had to pay $5k. So the contractor can collect that $5k, which would be $85,000 total.

But wait, the original bid was $75k, and the total was $80k. So the $5k is the difference. So the contractor can collect the $5k, making the total $80k.

But the owner wasn't forced to pay anything because she accepted the original bid. So the contractor can collect the $5k, which is the difference between the total and the original. So the contractor can recover $5k more than the original, making the total $80k.

But the owner wasn't forced to pay anything, so she didn't have to pay anything. So the contractor can just collect the $5k, which is an additional cost. So he can collect $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything. So the contractor can collect $5k in addition to the original bid.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k. So the contractor could collect the $5k, making the total $80k. So the contractor can recover $80k.

But that doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the contractor can get the $5k, and the owner was informed about the cost, so the contractor can collect that.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is B: $85,000.

Wait, but the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began. So she knew the contractor had to pay $5k. So the contractor can collect that $5k, making the total $80k.

But the owner didn't have to pay anything, so the contractor can just collect the $5k. So the total he can collect is $80k, but he only had to pay $5k. So the contractor can collect the $5k in addition to the original bid.

Wait, but the original bid was $75k, and the total was $80k. So the contractor can collect the $5k, making the total $80k. So he can collect $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything. So the contractor can just collect the $5k, which is an additional cost.

Wait, but why would the owner being informed about the increased cost make the contractor pay that? Because the owner knew the contractor had to pay $5k, so she could demand the contractor pay that $5k. But the owner didn't have to pay anything because she accepted the original bid.

So, the contractor can collect the $5k, which is an additional cost. So the total he can collect is $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything. So the contractor can just collect the $5k. So the total he can collect is $80k, but he only had to pay $5k.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct option is A: $75k only, because the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.

Wait, but the owner involved the subcontractor, so that shouldn't be the reason.

Alternatively, perhaps he can only recover the original bid because the owner didn't involve the subcontractor. But the owner did. So that can't be.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the law.

In a case where the contract was for $80k, and the contractor submitted $75k, but then had to pay $5k to the subcontractor, the total would be $80k. The owner accepted the original bid, but didn't have to pay anything because she accepted the original bid.

So the contractor can't claim the original bid because the total was $80k, which is above his original bid. So he can claim $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything.

But the options don't have that. So maybe the correct answer is A: $75k only, because the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.

But he did involve the subcontractor. So that can't be the reason.

Wait, perhaps the contractor can claim the $5k because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began. So the owner knew that the contractor had to pay $5k, so she could demand the contractor pay that $5k. But the owner didn't have to pay anything because she accepted the original bid.

So the contractor can collect the $5k, making the total $80k. But the owner didn't have to pay anything, so the contractor can just collect the $5k. So the contractor can collect $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything. So the contractor can just collect the $5k, which is an additional cost.

Wait, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is A: $75k only, because the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.

No, because the owner did involve the subcontractor.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: $85,000.

Because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began. So the contractor can collect the $5k, making the total $80k. So the contractor can collect $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything. So the contractor can collect the $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything.

Wait, but the owner had to pay the $5k because she accepted the original bid. So the owner was informed about the cost, but she had to pay the $5k. So the contractor can collect the $5k in addition to the original bid.

So the total he can collect is $80k.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the contractor can only claim the $5k because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began. So the owner knew that the contractor had to pay $5k, so she could demand the contractor pay that $5k. But the owner didn't have to pay anything because she accepted the original bid.

So the contractor can collect the $5k, making the total $80k. So the contractor can collect $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything. So the contractor can collect the $80k, but the owner didn't have to pay anything.

Wait, but the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began, so she knew the contractor had to pay $5k. So the contractor can collect that $5k, making the total $80k. But the owner didn't have to pay anything because she accepted the original bid.

So the contractor can collect the $5k, which is an additional cost. So the total he can collect is $80k, but he only had to pay $5k.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is A: $75k only, because the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.

But he did involve the subcontractor. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: $85,000.

Because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began. So the contractor can collect the $5k, making the total $80k. So the contractor can collect $85k, which is $5k plus the original bid. So the answer would be B.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should pick option B.
</think>

The contractor can recover the $5,000 that the owner had to pay for the subcontractor. However, the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began, which suggests that the contractor can collect the additional $5,000 as part of the total agreed price. Therefore, the contractor can recover the original bid plus the $5,000, totaling $80,000. However, since the owner was informed about the cost, the contractor can collect the $5,000 as an additional cost. Thus, the contractor can recover $85,000, which is the original bid plus the $5,000.

ANSWER: B
