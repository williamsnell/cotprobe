Question:

For a class project, Charlotte recorded the heights of all 28 students in her class and calculated several statistics. She then realized she made an error recording the height of the tallest person in the class. She correctly had him listed as the tallest, but needed to add two inches to his recorded height to correct it. Which of these measures of spread must remain unchanged?

Options:

A: Mean absolute deviation
B: Mean
C: Coefficient of variation
D: Variance
E: Range
F: Interquartile range
G: Standard deviation

Okay, so Charlotte made a mistake in her class project. She recorded the heights of 28 students, and the tallest person was listed as the tallest. But she needed to add two inches to his recorded height to correct it. Now, the question is asking which of the given measures of spread must remain unchanged.

Hmm, let's think about each measure. The options are mean absolute deviation, mean, coefficient of variation, variance, range, interquartile range, and standard deviation.

First, let's recall what each term means. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. Variance measures how spread out the numbers are relative to the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so it's also a measure of spread.

Now, the tallest person's height was overcorrected by two inches. So, the maximum value in the data set was increased by two inches. How does this affect each measure of spread?

Let's go through each option:

A: Mean absolute deviation (MAD). The MAD is calculated by taking the average of the absolute differences between each data point and the mean. If the maximum height is increased, the mean itself will change because it's an average. So, the differences from the new mean will also change, which would affect MAD. So, MAD would change, so this option is out.

B: Mean. The mean is the average of all the data points. Since one of the heights was increased by two inches, the total sum increases by two inches, and the mean will also increase by two inches. So, the mean changes. Therefore, B is not correct.

C: Coefficient of variation. The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean. Both the standard deviation and the mean would change because the mean is now higher, and the standard deviation also depends on the spread of the data. So, C would change.

D: Variance. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. Since adding 2 inches to one data point affects the squared difference, the variance will change. Because the formula for variance involves the squared differences, any change in one data point (and thus the mean) will affect how those squared differences are calculated. So, D is out.

E: Range. The range is the maximum minus the minimum. Since the maximum was increased by two inches, the range increases by two inches. Hence, the range changes. So, E is out.

F: Interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. It's based on the middle 50% of the data and doesn't directly depend on the maximum or minimum. So, even if the maximum increases, if the rest of the data remains the same, the IQR might stay the same. Wait, no, because IQR is calculated using Q3 and Q1. Let me think again. If the maximum increases, Q3 might also change if the maximum is part of the upper half. But wait, the IQR is the range between Q3 and Q1. If the maximum increases, but the Q3 remains the same, then IQR would change. Alternatively, if the change doesn't affect Q3, then IQR stays the same. Wait, but in this case, the tallest person was the maximum. So, adding two inches to his height would affect Q3 only if Q3 is a value in the top, but if the maximum is one of the top, then adding two inches increases it beyond Q3, which would increase the IQR. Wait, but no, because the IQR is based on the middle 50%, so adding two inches to the maximum would affect any data point above that, but not necessarily the IQR itself. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the IQR is unaffected because the IQR is based on the middle data points, not the extremes. So, adding two inches to the maximum might not affect the IQR if it's not in the upper half. Wait, but the IQR is calculated as Q3 - Q1. If the maximum was the highest data point, then Q3 is the middle of the upper half. If we add two inches to the maximum, that data point is now higher than Q3, so Q3 remains the same. So, if the maximum is Q3, adding two inches would increase it beyond Q3, but since Q3 is unchanged, the IQR (Q3 - Q1) remains the same. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the IQR is unaffected because it's based on the middle 50% of the data. Wait, no, because adding two inches to the maximum (which is part of the upper range) would affect the data points above it, potentially changing Q3 and Q1. Wait, no. Let me think: the IQR is the range between the first quartile and the third quartile. Quartiles are based on the ordered data. If the maximum is increased, then for calculating quartiles, the maximum would be included in the upper half. So, Q3 is the median of the upper half, which includes the maximum. If the maximum was part of the upper half, adding two inches to it would change the upper half, which affects Q3. So, for instance, suppose the maximum is part of the upper half. Then adding two inches to it would increase the upper half, which would increase Q3. Then, the IQR would be Q3 (now higher) minus Q1, which might not change if Q1 is unaffected. Alternatively, if the maximum is not part of the upper half, perhaps adding two inches to it doesn't affect the upper half. Wait, but the maximum is part of the data, so it's in the upper half if it's not the maximum of the upper half. Wait, no. The upper half is more than half the data. If the data has 28 students, the upper half would be the top 14. The maximum is in the upper half. So, when calculating Q3, which is the median of the upper half (14 students), the maximum is included in that. So, adding two inches to the maximum would change the upper half. So, Q3 would increase, which would make the IQR (Q3 - Q1) increase as well. So, the IQR would change. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the IQR remains the same because the maximum is the only change, but I think that's not the case. So, maybe F is not the correct answer.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of a different approach. Since the maximum has been increased by 2 inches, and the minimum hasn't changed. So, the maximum is now higher than before. The IQR is Q3 - Q1. If the maximum was in the upper half, adding two inches to it would increase the upper half's maximum, which would increase Q3, thus increasing the IQR. So, the IQR would change. So, option F is incorrect.

G: Standard deviation. Since the maximum is increased by two inches, the standard deviation, which involves the squared differences, would change. So, G is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. The standard deviation is a measure of spread. If all the data points are shifted up by a constant, the spread remains the same because the differences from the new mean would be the same as before. Wait, no. Wait, no, because the mean will also increase by two inches. So, each data point is now two inches higher than before, which affects the squared differences. The variance (and thus standard deviation) would increase because each squared difference (x_i - mean)^2 is now two inches higher, but the mean is also two inches higher. Wait, let's see: suppose the original data has a mean of μ and variance σ². When we add 2 to each data point, the new mean is μ + 2. The new variance is the average of (x_i + 2 - (μ + 2))^2 = average of (x_i - μ)^2, which is the same as σ². So, the variance remains the same. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So, adding a constant to each data point doesn't affect the variance or standard deviation. So, the standard deviation is unchanged. So, option G is unchanged.

Wait, so that would mean that the standard deviation is correct. But earlier, I was thinking that adding two inches to the maximum would affect other quartiles, but perhaps not the IQR or other measures. So, if G is standard deviation, which is unchanged, then G must remain the same.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think: when each data point is increased by 2, the mean increases by 2, and each individual term (x_i - mean) becomes (x_i + 2) - (mean + 2) = x_i - mean, so the differences remain the same. Therefore, the variance (which is based on squared differences) remains the same. So, yes, standard deviation is unchanged.

So, in that case, G must remain unchanged.

But wait, earlier I thought that adding two inches to the maximum would affect IQR, but maybe not. Let me think with a small example. Suppose I have data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], mean is 3, variance is ((1-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2)/5 = (4 + 1 + 0 + 1 +4)/5= 10/5=2, so standard deviation is sqrt(2) ≈1.414.

Now, if I add 2 to each data point: [3,4,5,6,7]. Mean is 5, variance is ((3-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + ... + (7-5)^2)/5 = same as before: (4 + 1 +0 +1 +4)/5=2. So, standard deviation is same as before.

Therefore, adding a constant to each data point does not change the variance or standard deviation. So, the standard deviation remains unchanged. So, G must remain unchanged.

So, the correct answer is G.

The answer is G: Standard deviation.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Charlotte made an error by adding two inches to the tallest person's height. This affected the data set, but we need to determine which measure of spread remains unchanged.

2. **Recalling Definitions:**
   - **Mean (B):** Changes because adding two inches increases the total sum.
   - **Range (E):** Changes because the maximum height increases by two inches.
   - **Variance (D) and Standard Deviation (G):** Both measure spread relative to the mean. Adding a constant to all data points does not affect their spread.
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR, F):** Not directly affected by adding a constant, but in this case, since the maximum is the only change, it might slightly affect it, but overall, it likely remains the same.
   - **Coefficient of Variation (C):** Changes because both mean and standard deviation change.

3. **Example Analysis:** Adding 2 to each data point preserves variance and standard deviation, as shown in the example. This is because variance is based on squared differences, which remain unaffected by additive constants.

**Conclusion:** The standard deviation remains unchanged because all data points are shifted uniformly, preserving their relative distances from the mean. Thus, the correct answer is G: Standard deviation.
