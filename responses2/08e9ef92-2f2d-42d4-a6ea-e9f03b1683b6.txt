Okay, so I've got this question about chain discounts. Let me think through it step by step. The question says that Parks Wholesalers are offering a chain discount of 25-10-5% on sofas. They want to know what's an equivalent single discount for this series.

Hmm, I remember that chain discounts are applied one after another. So, it's like applying each discount successively. Each discount is applied to the price after the previous discount has been taken off. So, the first discount is 25%, then the next is 10%, and the last is 5%.

Wait, how do I calculate the equivalent single discount? I think the formula involves multiplying the remaining percentages after each discount and then subtracting from 100% to find the total discount. Let me recall the formula.

The formula for the equivalent single discount (D) when there are multiple successive discounts (d1, d2, d3, etc.) is:

D = 100% - ( (100 - d1)% * (100 - d2)% * (100 - d3)% * ... )

So, applying that here, the discounts are 25%, 10%, and 5%. Let's plug those numbers in.

First, each discount is subtracted from 100 to get the remaining percentage. So:

25% discount: 100 - 25 = 75% remains.

10% discount: 100 - 10 = 90% remains.

5% discount: 100 -5 =95% remains.

Now, multiply these percentages together:

75% * 90% *95% = ?

Let me calculate that. Let's do it step by step.

75 * 90 = 6750. Then, 6750 * 95. Wait, that's a big number. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert percentages to decimals.

75% is 0.75, 90% is 0.9, 95% is 0.95.

Multiply them: 0.75 * 0.9 = 0.675. Then, 0.675 * 0.95. Let me compute that.

0.675 * 0.95: 0.675 * 0.95 = (0.6 + 0.075) * 0.95 = 0.6*0.95 + 0.075*0.95.

0.6*0.95 = 0.57.

0.075*0.95: 0.07 *0.95 = 0.0665, 0.005 *0.95 = 0.00475. Add them: 0.0665 + 0.00475 = 0.07125.

So total is 0.57 + 0.07125 = 0.64125.

So 0.64125 is the remaining percentage after all discounts. So, the total discount is 100% - 64.125% = 35.875%.

Wait, but the options are:

A: 36.5%  
B:30%  
C:50%  
D:34%  
E:32.5%  
F:25%  
G:40%  
H:37.5%  
I:38%  
J:35.875%

So, the calculation gives 35.875%, which is option J. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Let me recompute the product: 0.75 * 0.9 = 0.675. Then, 0.675 * 0.95. Let's compute 0.675 * 0.95.

Another way: 0.675 * 0.95 = (0.6 + 0.075) * 0.95 = 0.6*0.95 + 0.075*0.95.

0.6*0.95:

0.6 * 1 = 0.6, so 0.6*0.95 = (0.6 * 95)/100 = (57)/100 = 0.57.

0.075 * 0.95: 75 * 0.95 = 71.25, so 71.25 / 1000 = 0.07125.

Adding together: 0.57 + 0.07125 = 0.64125.

So, 0.64125 is correct. So the remaining is 64.125%, so the discount is 35.875%.

Looking at the options, J is 35.875%, so that's the correct answer.

The calculation involves multiplying the remaining percentages after each discount:

1. 25% discount leaves 75%.
2. 10% discount leaves 90%.
3. 5% discount leaves 95%.

Multiply: 0.75 * 0.9 * 0.95 = 0.64125, which is 64.125% remaining. The equivalent single discount is 100% - 64.125% = 35.875%.

The correct answer is J: 35.875%.
