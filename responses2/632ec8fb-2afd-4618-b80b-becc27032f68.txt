Alright, so I've got this question about Dash Co.'s utility bills and figuring out the liability that should be reported on the balance sheet as of June 30. Hmm, let me think this through.

Okay, the question gives me a series of utility bills with different amounts and payment dates. I need to determine which of these are past due and thus should be reported as a liability. 

Let me list out the information again to make it clearer. The dates and amounts are paired, so each month has two bills. 

So, the first one is April 16th for $5,000. The second is May 15th also for $5,000. Then June 1st for $6,000. July 1st for $8,000. August... Wait, wait, the August part is a bit unclear. It says August 1, but the next line says August 1. Oh, maybe it's a typo and should be August 15th or something else. Wait, maybe I should just focus on the dates and amounts given.

So, the key is to figure out which of these bills were due but haven't been paid by June 30. Because the balance sheet at June 30 would show the amount owed.

Let me break down each bill's due date and payment date. 

1. April 16th: amount $5,000. The next payment is May 15th. So, the payment is still pending. So, this $5,000 bill is still owed.

2. May 15th: another $5,000. The payment is made on May 16th. So, this one is paid, no liability.

3. June 1st: $6,000. Paid on June 16th. So, again, this is paid, no liability.

4. July 1st: $8,000. Paid on July 15th. So, also paid.

5. August 1st: Hmm, the problem's description is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the question says August 1... but the next line says August 1, but that's probably a repetition. Maybe it's a typo. If the payment was made on August 15th, then August 1 would be before that. So, the August bill is due but hasn't been paid by June 30, so it's still a liability. Wait, but June 30 is the date we're looking at. So, if the payment is made after June 30, then the bill is still due. But wait, the payment date is August 15th, which is far in the future. So, this would be a liability because it's not paid by June 30.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me look at the options again. The question is about June 30, so any bill that's due after June 30 is a liability.

So, let's go through each bill:

April 16: $5k, due May 15th. So, if June 30 is after May 15, this is due but not paid by June 30, so it's a liability.

May 15: $5k, paid by June 16th. So, paid, no liability.

June 1: $6k, paid June 16th. Paid, no liability.

July 1: $8k, paid July 15th. Paid, no liability.

August 1: Wait, the question's text says August 1, but the next line says August 1. Wait, perhaps that's a typo. Let's assume the August payment is due on August 15th. So, August 1 is before August 15th. So, August 1 bill is due but hasn't been paid by June 30. Wait, June 30 is before August 1. Oh, so that bill hasn't been paid by June 30, so it's still a liability.

Wait, that's conflicting because June 30 is before August 1. So, the August 1 bill is due but hasn't been paid by June 30, so it's still a liability. So, that would be $8,000 in the liability amount.

Wait, but let me think again. The fourth bill is July 1st payment on July 15th. So, July 1 is before July 15, so that's paid. The fifth is August 1, payment on August 15. So August 1 is before August 15, so that's also paid. Wait, no, but June 30 is before August, so August 1 is in August.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's clarify the payment dates. Let's list each bill's payment date and due date.

1. April 16: due May 15. So, June 30 is after May 15, so this is a liability.

2. May 15: paid by June 16. So, paid, no liability.

3. June 1: paid June 16. Paid, no liability.

4. July 1: paid July 15. Paid, no liability.

5. August 1: payment is due on August 15. So, August 1 is before August 15, so this bill is due, but the payment is made on August 1. Wait, but August 1 is within August, which is before June 30 (since June 30 is in June). So, August 1 is after June 30.

Wait, wait, June 30 is a date in June. August 1 is in August, which is after June. So, the August 1th bill is due but hasn't been paid by June 30. So, that's still a liability.

Wait, but that can't be right because August 1 is after June 30, so the August bill is still due.

Wait, but the question is about the liability as of June 30. So, if a bill is due on August 1, and payment hasn't been made by June 30, it's still a liability.

Wait, but looking back at the question: the payment dates are in the August part. Let me see:

The last part: August 1, June 16. So, August 1 is when the August bill is due. So, payment was made on August 15. So, August 15 is payment date for August bill, but June 30 is before August 15. So, August 1 bill is due but not paid by June 30. Therefore, August 1 bill is a liability.

Wait, but I thought the payment was on August 15, which is after August 1. So, June 30 is before August 15, so August 1 bill is still due.

Wait, so in the options, the amounts we need to consider are the ones due but not paid by June 30.

Looking back, the first bill is April 16 due May 15, paid on May 16. So, paid by June 30. So, no liability.

The second is May 15, paid June 16. So, paid, no liability.

Third is June 1, paid June 16. Paid, no liability.

Fourth is July 1, paid July 15. Paid, no liability.

Fifth is August 1, due August 15. So, if June 30 is the balance sheet date, and August 15 is payment date, then August 1 bill is due but not paid by June 30, so it's a liability.

Wait, but that's confusing because June 30 is before August 15. So, August 1 bill is due but not paid by June 30. So, that's another bill.

Wait, but the question is about the last payment date, which is August 15. So, the payment was made on August 15, which is after June 30. So, the August 1 bill is due and not paid by June 30, so it's a liability.

So, the two bills that are due but not paid by June 30 are the first one (April 16, $5k) and the August 1, $8k bill.

Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, the May 15th bill is paid on June 16th, which is before June 30. So, paid, no liability.

The June 1 is paid on June 16, no liability.

July 1 is paid on July 15.

August 1 is due on August 15. So, June 30 is before August 15, so August 1 bill is a liability.

Wait, but that's the only one. So, the August 1 bill is $8k, and the April 16 bill is $5k.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the "last" character of the answer. Oh wait, the question is asking for the amount Dash should report as a liability on June 30.

So, any bill that's due after June 30 is a liability.

So, the August 1 bill is due on August 15, which is after June 30. So, it's a liability.

So, the amounts in the balance sheet would be $5k and $8k. But wait, the options don't have an option adding them together. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are individual amounts. The choices are A through J, each an option for the amount. So, each option is a single number.

Wait, in the options, H is $12,000. D is $13,000, etc.

Wait, so the only bill due after June 30 is August 1, $8,000. The April 16 bill is paid on June 16, so it's paid, no liability.

Wait, but I thought the August 1 bill is due but hasn't been paid by June 30.

Ah, I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.

Each bill is due on a certain date. If the payment was made on or before June 30, it's paid. Else, it's a liability.

So, let's list each bill:

1. April 16: Due May 15. Paid on May 16. So, paid. No liability.

2. May 15: Due June 16. Paid on June 16. Paid. No liability.

3. June 1: Due June 16. Paid on June 16. Paid. No liability.

4. July 1: Due July 15. Paid on July 15. Paid. No liability.

5. August 1: Due August 15. Paid on August 15. Paid. No liability.

Wait, but this can't be right because June 30 is before August 15. So, August 1 bill is due but not paid by June 30. So, it's a liability.

Wait, so the August 1 bill would be due but not paid. So, the amount is $8,000.

Wait, but the options don't have an option for $8,000. Wait, looking back: the options are A:8,000, B:5,000, etc. So option A is $8k.

But wait, I thought there might be another bill. Oh, wait, what about the June 15th bill. Wait, no, the June 15th is a $5k. It was paid on June 16th. So, that's paid.

Wait, but the August 1 bill is due on August 15, and paid on August 15. So, June 30 is before August 15, so August 1 bill is due but not paid by June 30. Therefore, it's a liability.

So, the total liability would be $5k (April 16) plus $8k (August 1) = $13,000.

Wait, that would be option D: $13,000.

Wait, but wait, why am I thinking that the August 1 is the only one? Because I thought June 15th was a $5k, paid on June 16, so no liability.

Wait, but let me recheck the initial information. The last part says August 1, what's that? So, maybe the August 1 bill is $8,000, which is due on August 15. Since June 30 is before August 15, it's a liability. So, the total is $5k (April 16) and $8k (August 1) = $13k.

Looking at the options, D is $13,000.

But wait, isn't the August 15 payment date? So, June 30 is before August 15, so August 1 bill is still a liability.

So, the total liability is $5k + $8k = $13,000.

Wait, but wait, the May 15th bill was paid on June 16, so no liability.

So, the only amounts due but not paid by June 30 are $5k (April 16) and $8k (August 1). So, sum is $13,000.

But wait, are there other bills? Let me recount.

The initial information:

Period covered | Amount | Date paid

April 16 | $5k | May 15

May 15 | $5k | June 16

June 1 | $6k | June 16

July 1 | $8k | July 15

August 1 | ? | August 15

Wait, the August part is unclear. Let me recheck the initial data.

The user provided:

Period covered Amount Date paid

April 16 $5000 May 15

June 15 $5000 June 16

July 1 June 15 August 1

Wait, no, the last line is:

August 1 | August 15 $8000?

Wait, looking back, the question lists:

Period covered Amount Date paid

April 16 $5000 May 15

June 15 $5000 June 16

July 1 June 15 August 1

August 1 August 15 $8000

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the user wrote:

After the previous lines, the information is:

Period covered Amount Date paid

April 16 ‚Äì May 15 $5000 June 15

June 15 May 16 $5000 June 16

July 1 June 15 $6000 July 15

August 1 August 15 $8000 August 1

Wait, no, looking again:

The user's data is:

Period covered | Amount | Date paid

April 16 | $5000 | May 15

June 15 | $5000 | June 16

July 1 | $6000 | June 15

August 1 | $8000 | August 1

So, the August 1 bill is $8,000 due on August 15. So, June 30 is before August 15, so this bill is a liability.

So, the only liability is the August 1 bill, which is $8,000. So, the answer should be option A: $8,000.

Wait, no, because the May 15 bill is paid on June 16, so no liability. So, only August 1 bill is a liability.

So, the answer is $8,000.

Wait, but earlier I thought there might be another bill, but no, the August 1 is the only one.

Wait, but wait. Let me look again.

Wait, the August 15 payment is on August 15. So, June 30 is before August 15, so August 1 bill is still a liability.

So, the only liability is $8,000. So, the answer is option A: $8,000.

But wait, the May 15 bill was paid on June 16, so no liability. The August 1 bill is due but not paid by June 30, so that's $8,000.

So, the correct answer is A.
</think>

To determine the amount Dash Co. should report as a liability on its June 30 balance sheet, we need to identify which utility bills are still unpaid as of June 30. Each bill's payment date is compared to June 30 to decide if it is paid or still due.

### Key Information:
1. **April 16, $5,000**: Paid on June 16. Paid by June 30. No liability.
2. **May 15, $5,000**: Paid on June 16. Paid by June 30. No liability.
3. **June 1, $6,000**: Paid on June 16. Paid by June 30. No liability.
4. **July 1, $8,000**: Paid on July 15. Paid by June 30. No liability.
5. **August 1, $8,000**: Due on August 15. June 30 is before August 15. This bill is still a liability.

### Conclusion:
Only the August 1 bill ($8,000) is due but not paid by June 30. Therefore, Dash Co. should report **$8,000** as a liability on its June 30 balance sheet.
