Okay, so I need to figure out which principle utilitarianism is defined by. I remember that utilitarianism is a philosophical theory, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think about what I know.

I recall that utilitarianism is about maximizing happiness or utility. So, the main idea is that the best action is the one that leads to the greatest overall happiness or well-being. That means you don't just look at what happens to one person, but the overall impact on all people.

Looking at the options, option A says "Maximising personal pleasure." That sounds a bit similar to utilitarianism, but I think it's more about the overall outcome. So maybe A is not the correct definition.

Option B: "Maximisation of outcomes for individuals." Hmm, this sounds a bit more general. I'm not sure if that's the exact definition. Or maybe it's more about individual outcomes than the overall group.

Option C: "The least worst outcome for everybody." That makes sense. Utilitarianists would prefer the outcome that is the least harmful to everyone. So, they're looking for the best possible outcome, considering the worst that can happen to each individual.

Option D and E seem unrelated. D talks about equality of opportunity, and E is about equality. I don't think these are part of utilitarianism.

Option F is about the best outcome for the minority. That sounds like a different approach, maybe even more extreme than utilitarianism. It doesn't consider the well-being of the majority.

Option G is about no harm to any individual. That sounds more like a utilitarian approach, but perhaps more about taking into account the potential harm rather than just maximizing overall well-being.

Option H is about the best outcome for the majority. Again, it's about the best for the majority, but not necessarily the least worst.

Option I says "The least worst outcome for the majority of people." That sounds like it's a utilitarian approach because it's about minimizing the negative impact on the majority, which is then the same as maximizing overall happiness.

Option J is about maximizing wealth and resources for everyone. That's more about economic efficiency rather than the overall well-being of individuals.

So putting it together, utilitarianism is about making choices that lead to the greatest overall happiness, which can be thought of as the least worst outcome for the majority. So options C and I seem similar. Wait, but are they the same?

Wait, option C is "The least worst outcome for everybody." That's about all individuals. Option I says "The least worst outcome for the majority." So they are similar but not exactly the same. But wait, in utilitarianism, the focus is on the best possible outcome for all, considering everyone's worst. So perhaps option C is the exact definition.

Alternatively, option I might be a more specific approach, but I'm not sure. I think the main point is that it's about the best overall outcome, considering the worst from everyone's perspective. So I think option C is the definition.

The correct answer is C: "The least worst outcome for everybody." 

**Explanation:**
Utilitarianism is defined as the principle that the best action is the one that leads to the greatest overall happiness or well-being. This means that the focus is on the least worst outcome for every individual, considering the collective well-being. While option I ("The least worst outcome for the majority") is close, it emphasizes the majority rather than the entire group, which might not fully encapsulate the essence of utilitarianism.
