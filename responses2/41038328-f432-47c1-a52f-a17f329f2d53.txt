Okay, so I've got this question here about rounding a number to the nearest hundred. The number given is 794 miles, and I need to round that to the nearest hundred. Hmm, let's think about how rounding works.

Rounding to the nearest hundred means looking at the tens digit to decide whether to round up or down. The hundreds place is the third digit from the right. In 794, the hundreds digit is 7, the tens digit is 9, and the ones digit is 4.

Wait, right. So the rule is, if the tens digit is 5 or higher, we round up the hundreds digit by one. If it's less than 5, we leave the hundreds digit as is. In this case, the tens digit is 9, which is definitely higher than 5. So that means we round up the hundreds digit from 7 to 8.

So after rounding, the number becomes 800. Let me double-check. 794 is between 700 and 800. Since 794 is closer to 800 (only 6 miles away) than to 700 (which is 94 miles away), it makes sense to round up to 800.

Looking at the options, option G is 800, so that must be the correct answer.

The distance is 794 miles. To round to the nearest hundred, look at the tens digit (9). Since 9 is â‰¥5, round up the hundreds digit (7) to 8, resulting in 800. The correct answer is G: 800.

Answer: G: 800
