Okay, so I have this problem here about arithmetic and geometric progressions. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the problem says there's a sequence of three real numbers that form an arithmetic progression (AP) with the first term being 9. So, let me recall what an arithmetic progression is. In an AP, each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference. Let's denote that common difference as 'd'. 

So, the three terms of the AP would be:
1st term: 9
2nd term: 9 + d
3rd term: 9 + 2d

Now, the problem says that if we add 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term, the resulting three numbers form a geometric progression (GP). A GP is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio. Let's denote this common ratio as 'r'.

So, after modification, the three terms of the GP would be:
1st term: 9 (unchanged)
2nd term: (9 + d) + 2 = 11 + d
3rd term: (9 + 2d) + 20 = 29 + 2d

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the second term is 9 + d, then we add 2, so it becomes 9 + d + 2 = 11 + d. The third term was 9 + 2d, then we add 20, so 9 + 2d + 20 = 29 + 2d. So yes, that's correct.

Since these form a GP, the ratio between consecutive terms should be constant. So, the ratio between the second and first term should be equal to the ratio between the third and second term.

Mathematically, that means:
(11 + d) / 9 = (29 + 2d) / (11 + d)

Cross-multiplying to solve for d. Let me write that down:

(11 + d) * (11 + d) = 9 * (29 + 2d)

Expanding the left side:
(11 + d)^2 = 121 + 22d + d^2

The right side is:
9*(29 + 2d) = 261 + 18d

So, setting them equal:

121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d

Let me bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:

d^2 + 22d + 121 - 261 - 18d = 0

Simplify:

d^2 + (22d - 18d) + (121 - 261) = 0
d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0

Hmm, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, so we have 121 + 22d + d² = 261 + 18d.

Subtracting 261 and 18d from both sides:

d² + 22d + 121 - 261 -18d = 0
d² + (22d - 18d) + (121 - 261) = 0
d² +4d -140=0

Yes, that looks correct.

So, the quadratic equation is d² + 4d -140 = 0.

Let me try to solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is d = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=4, c=-140.

So, discriminant D = (4)^2 -4*1*(-140) = 16 + 560 = 576.

Square root of 576 is 24.

Therefore, d = [-4 ±24]/2

So, two solutions:

First solution: (-4 +24)/2 = 20/2 =10

Second solution: (-4 -24)/2 = (-28)/2 = -14

So, d can be 10 or -14.

Now, let's find the third term of the GP for each case and see which one is the smallest possible.

First, for d=10:

The original AP terms are 9, 19, 29.

After modification, the GP terms are 9, 19+2=21, 29+20=49.

Wait, so the GP is 9,21,49.

Is this a GP? Let's check the ratios.

21/9 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333

49/21 ≈ 2.333

Yes, so common ratio r=7/3.

So, the third term is 49.

Second, for d=-14:

Original AP terms are 9, 9 + (-14)= -5, 9 + 2*(-14)=9 -28= -19.

After modification, the GP terms are 9, (-5)+2= -3, (-19)+20=1.

So, the GP is 9, -3, 1.

Is this a GP? Let's check the ratios.

(-3)/9 = -1/3

1/(-3) = -1/3

So, the common ratio is -1/3.

Thus, the third term is 1.

Now, the problem asks for the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression.

Looking at the two possibilities, 49 and 1, the smallest is 1. So, the answer should be 1. Looking at the options, that's option I.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

Wait, when d=10, the third term is 49, which is one of the options, but when d=-14, the third term is 1, which is smaller than 49.

Wait, but let me double-check the problem statement: the original AP is 9, 9 + d, 9 + 2d. When d=-14, it's 9, 9-14= -5, 9-28=-19. Then adding 2 to the second term (-5 +2= -3), and adding 20 to the third term (-19 +20=1). So GP is 9, -3, 1. Ratios are -3/9=-1/3 and 1/(-3)=-1/3. So yes, that's a valid GP.

So, the third term is 1, which is the smallest among the two possible values. So, the answer should be 1, which is option I.

Wait, but the options are A:12, B:16, C:2, D:7, E:5, F:3, G:-1, H:0, I:1, J:9.

So, 1 is option I, which is correct.

Wait, but hold on a moment. The problem says "the smallest possible value for the third term". So, 1 is smaller than 2, 3, etc. So, yes, it's correct.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check the calculation for d=-14.

Original AP: 9, -5, -19.

Adding 2 to the second term: -5 +2= -3.

Adding 20 to the third term: -19 +20=1.

So GP terms are 9, -3, 1. So, 9, -3, 1.

Is this a GP? Let's compute the ratios:

Second term / first term: (-3)/9 = -1/3

Third term / second term: 1/(-3) = -1/3

Yes, so it is a GP with common ratio -1/3.

So, the third term is 1, which is the smallest possible value.

Therefore, the correct answer is I, which is 1.

Wait, but hold on another thought: when d=-14, is the third term 1? Because when I add 20 to -19, it becomes 1. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me re-calculate.

Starting from the equation:

(11 + d)/(9) = (29 + 2d)/(11 + d)

Cross multiplying: (11 + d)^2 =9*(29 + 2d)

11² = 121, 2*11*d=22d, d².

So, 121 + 22d + d² = 261 + 18d

Bring all terms to left:

d² +22d +121 -261 -18d=0

d² +4d -140=0

Yes, that's correct.

So, solving quadratic, discriminant is 16 + 560=576, sqrt is 24.

So, d=( -4 ±24)/2.

First solution:20/2=10, second: -28/2=-14.

So yes, that's correct.

So, when d=-14, third term is 1.

So the answer is 1, which is option I.

Wait, but let me make sure that the problem didn't have any constraints on the GP terms. For example, could the GP terms include negative numbers, but in this case, when d=-14, the third term is 1, which is positive. But it's still a valid GP with a negative ratio.

So, yes, 1 is a valid answer and it's the smallest among all possibilities.

Therefore, I'm confident the answer is I:1.
