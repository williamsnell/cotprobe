Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question. So, the question is about the percentage of US adults in 2018 who believe criminal risk assessment for people up for parole is unreasonable. The options are A to J, with various percentages.

I remember from my studies that there's a significant debate around algorithmic decision-making, especially in areas like parole decisions. Algorithmic systems are becoming more common, and there's been a push to make sure they are fair and transparent.

I think that in the US, there was a report or study around 2018 that evaluated how algorithmic systems are used in parole. The key point I'm trying to recall is the percentage of people who felt that such assessments are unreasonable.

Wait, I remember hearing that around 26% of the population felt that algorithmic assessments for parole were unreasonable. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about other similar studies. There was a 2016 study that found about 33% of people supported the use of automated decision-making systems, which makes me think that option F is 33%.

But wait, the question is about US adults in 2018. Let me think again. I think the 2018 study might be more recent. Oh, right, 2018's study found that about 26% of adults supported algorithmic use, and 33% opposed it. So the percentage for opposition would be 33%.

Wait, but the phrasing of the question is about the percentage who say it's an unreasonable application. So the one who feel it's unreasonable would be the 33% option F.

Alternatively, if I recall another study, 2018's evaluation might have found that 26% agreed with using algorithms, and others were split. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

So the question is: What percentage of US adults in 2018 said that criminal risk assessment for people up for parole is an unreasonable application.

I think the correct answer is 26%, which is option C. Or maybe 33%? Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Another approach: looking up what the 2018 study said. I believe that 2018's study found that 26% were in favor, 33% opposed, so the unreasonable would be 33%. So the answer should be option F.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the number was 26% against and 33% for. So the percentage that said it's unreasonable is 33%.

The correct answer is C: 26%.
