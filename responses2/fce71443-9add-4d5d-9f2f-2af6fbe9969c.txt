Okay, so I've got this spring-mass system problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The differential equation given is u'' + (1/4)u' + u = k g(t), with initial conditions u(0) = 0 and u'(0) = 0. The parameter k is 2. The function g(t) is the difference of two unit step functions: u_{3/2}(t) - u_{5/2}(t). That means g(t) is 1 for t between 3/2 and 5/2, and 0 otherwise.

I remember that for systems with forcing functions that are step functions, the solution involves Laplace transforms. So, maybe I should use Laplace transforms to solve this.

First, let me rewrite the equation in terms of Laplace transforms. The Laplace transform of u'' is s²U(s) - s u(0) - u'(0), which simplifies to s²U(s) since u(0) and u'(0) are zero. Similarly, the Laplace transform of u' is sU(s). And the Laplace transform of g(t) is the Laplace transform of a rectangular pulse from 3/2 to 5/2.

The Laplace transform of u_{a}(t) - u_{b}(t) is e^{-a s}/s - e^{-b s}/s. So, for g(t), it's e^{-1.5 s}/s - e^{-2.5 s}/s, since 3/2 is 1.5 and 5/2 is 2.5.

Putting it all together, the Laplace transform of the differential equation is:

s² U(s) + (1/4) s U(s) + U(s) = k [e^{-1.5 s}/s - e^{-2.5 s}/s]

Since k is 2, that becomes:

s² U(s) + (1/4) s U(s) + U(s) = 2 [e^{-1.5 s}/s - e^{-2.5 s}/s]

Factor U(s):

U(s) [s² + (1/4) s + 1] = 2 [e^{-1.5 s}/s - e^{-2.5 s}/s]

So, U(s) = 2 [e^{-1.5 s}/s - e^{-2.5 s}/s] / (s² + (1/4)s + 1)

Now, to find u(t), I need to take the inverse Laplace transform of U(s). Since the denominator is a quadratic, it might be easier to factor it or complete the square.

Let me compute the denominator: s² + (1/4)s + 1.

The standard form is s² + a s + b, so a = 1/4, b = 1.

The roots would be [-a ± sqrt(a² - 4b)] / 2. Wait, no, the quadratic formula is s = [-a ± sqrt(a² - 4b)] / 2, but here a is 1/4, so:

s = [-1/4 ± sqrt( (1/4)^2 - 4*1 ) ] / 2? Wait, wait, no, wait. The quadratic is s² + (1/4)s + 1, so a in the formula is 1/4, and b is 1. So discriminant D = (1/4)^2 - 4*1*1 = 1/16 -4 = -63/16, which is negative. So the roots are complex: (-1/4 ± j sqrt(63/16))/2. Let me compute that.

Wait, sqrt(63/16) is sqrt(63)/4. So the roots are (-1/4)/2 ± j (sqrt(63)/4)/2. So that's -1/8 ± j sqrt(63)/8.

So, the denominator can be written as (s + 1/8)^2 + (sqrt(63)/8)^2.

Wait, let's check:

(s + a)^2 + b^2 = s² + 2a s + (a² + b²). Comparing with s² + (1/4)s +1, we have 2a = 1/4, so a = 1/8. Then, a² + b² = 1. So, (1/8)^2 + b² = 1 → 1/64 + b² = 1 → b² = 63/64 → b = sqrt(63)/8 ≈ 0.9921567.

So, the denominator factors as (s + 1/8)^2 + (sqrt(63)/8)^2.

Now, the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s² + (sqrt(63)/8)^2) is (8/sqrt(63)) sin( sqrt(63)/8 s ). But since the denominator is (s + 1/8)^2 + (sqrt(63)/8)^2, the inverse transform will involve exponential multiplied by sine.

So, the inverse Laplace transform of U(s) is 2 * [ e^{-1.5 s} * (8/sqrt(63)) sin( sqrt(63)/8 s ) - e^{-2.5 s} * (8/sqrt(63)) sin( sqrt(63)/8 s ) ] / [ (s + 1/8)^2 + (sqrt(63)/8)^2 ]

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the inverse Laplace as a convolution. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out the 8/sqrt(63) as a constant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write U(s) as 2 [ e^{-1.5 s} (1/s) - e^{-2.5 s} (1/s) ] divided by the denominator.

Wait, maybe I should use the convolution theorem, which says that the inverse Laplace of e^{-a s} F(s) is f(t - a) H(t - a), where H is the Heaviside step function.

So, let's write U(s) as 2 [ e^{-1.5 s}/s - e^{-2.5 s}/s ] divided by (s² + (1/4)s + 1).

So, if I let F(s) = 1/(s² + (1/4)s + 1), then U(s) = 2 [e^{-1.5 s} F(s) - e^{-2.5 s} F(s)].

Then, the inverse Laplace transform is 2 [ f(t -1.5) H(t -1.5) - f(t -2.5) H(t -2.5) ].

So, f(t) is the inverse Laplace transform of F(s), which is 2 e^{-1/8} sin( (sqrt(63)/8 ) t ) multiplied by e^{-1/8} (since the denominator was shifted), wait, no, let me correct.

Wait, F(s) is 1/(s² + (1/4)s +1) = 1/(s² + 0.25 s + 1). As I found earlier, that can be written as (s + 0.125)^2 + (sqrt(63)/8)^2.

Wait, more accurately, F(s) = 1/(s² + (1/4)s + 1). Let me write it in standard form.

The standard form is (s + a)^2 + b². So, to complete the square:

s² + (1/4)s + 1 = (s + (1/8))² + (1 - (1/8)^2) = (s + 0.125)^2 + (1 - 1/64) = (s + 0.125)^2 + (63/64).

So, F(s) = 1 / [ (s + 0.125)^2 + (sqrt(63)/8)^2 ].

Thus, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is (8 / sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125 t} sin( (sqrt(63)/8 ) t ).

So, f(t) = (8 / sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125 t} sin( (sqrt(63)/8 ) t ).

Therefore, the inverse Laplace of U(s) is 2 [ f(t -1.5) H(t -1.5) - f(t -2.5) H(t -2.5) ].

So, putting it all together, the solution u(t) is:

u(t) = 2 [ (8 / sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125 (t - 1.5)} sin( (sqrt(63)/8 )(t -1.5) ) H(t -1.5) - (8 / sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125 (t - 2.5)} sin( (sqrt(63)/8 )(t -2.5) ) H(t -2.5) ) ]

Simplify the constants. Since 2 * (8 / sqrt(63)) = 16 / sqrt(63). So,

u(t) = (16 / sqrt(63)) [ e^{-0.125 (t - 1.5)} sin( (sqrt(63)/8 )(t -1.5) ) H(t -1.5) - e^{-0.125 (t - 2.5)} sin( (sqrt(63)/8 )(t -2.5) ) H(t -2.5) ]

But H(t - a) is zero for t < a, so for t <1.5, u(t) is zero, and for t <2.5, only the second term remains. Wait, actually, H(t -1.5) is 1 for t >=1.5, so the first term is non-zero for t >=1.5. The second term H(t-2.5) is 1 for t >=2.5, so it's non-zero there.

But since the problem says that u(t) is the solution, we can just consider the terms for t >=0.

So, for t >=0, u(t) is the sum of these two terms, but let me think about the behavior of u(t) after a certain time. The question is, after certain time tau, |u(t)| <0.1 for all t>tau. So, we need to find tau such that after tau, the amplitude of u(t) is less than 0.1.

Wait, but the function u(t) is a combination of two exponentially decaying sine waves. The first term has a phase shift of 1.5, and the second has 2.5, and each has an exponential decay with a factor of e^{-0.125 (t - a)}, where a is 1.5 and 2.5.

So, the first term is e^{-0.125 (t - 1.5)} sin(...) H(t -1.5). The second term is e^{-0.125 (t - 2.5)} sin(...) H(t -2.5).

So, the function u(t) is the sum of these two terms.

Since both terms are exponentially decaying, the first term dies off faster than the second. So, for large t, the dominant term is the first one, because e^{-0.125 (t -1.5)} is larger than e^{-0.125 (t -2.5)} because 1.5 <2.5. So, as t increases, the first term decays more rapidly than the second.

But wait, since both terms are multiplied by sine functions, the overall behavior could be a combination of these. However, the question asks for |u(t)| <0.1 for all t>tau. So, we need to find tau such that after that time, the amplitude of u(t) is less than 0.1.

Wait, but wait. The question says that after tau, |u(t)| <0.1 for all t>tau. So, perhaps as time increases beyond tau, the amplitude of u(t) will eventually decay to zero, but we need the point where it's less than 0.1 for all subsequent times. But perhaps u(t) has a transient part and a steady-state part. But in this case, the system is underdamped because the denominator's discriminant is negative (as we found earlier). So, the system will oscillate with an exponentially decaying amplitude.

Wait, but in this problem, the forcing function is a step function. So, the response will involve an initial transient and then approach a steady-state. But perhaps the transient dies off, and after some time, the oscillations die down, and the amplitude becomes small enough that |u(t)| <0.1 for all t beyond tau.

So, to find tau, I need to find when the amplitude of the oscillations (i.e., the maximum value) drops below 0.1.

But the problem is that the function u(t) is the sum of two decaying exponentials multiplied by sine functions. So, the amplitude envelope would be the maximum of the two terms.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a damped oscillation. The maximum value of u(t) occurs at some time when the derivative is zero, which would be when the time derivative of u(t) is zero. But that might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the envelope as the maximum value of the two terms. Since both terms are decaying exponentials, the maximum will be the larger of the two. So, perhaps the maximum amplitude is the maximum between the two terms, so the maximum of (16 / sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125 (t -1.5)} sin(...) and (16 / sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125 (t -2.5)} sin(...). But since the sine functions can be positive or negative, the maximum would be when both terms are maximized.

Wait, but since the sine functions are multiplied by the decaying exponentials, the maximum of u(t) would be the maximum of these two terms. Let me think: the first term's amplitude is 16/sqrt(63) e^{-0.125 (t -1.5)}, and the second is 16/sqrt(63) e^{-0.125 (t -2.5)}. Since the first term decays more slowly (because it's at 1.5, which is earlier), the maximum of u(t) would be approximately the first term, because it's larger for t >=1.5. The second term starts at t=2.5, and decays more rapidly than the first term.

So, for t >=2.5, the second term is the dominant one. But after a certain time, the second term's exponential decay will cause it to become negligible compared to the first term.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that after tau, |u(t)| <0.1 for all t>tau. So, we need to find tau such that for any t>tau, u(t) is less than 0.1 in magnitude.

But since the first term is e^{-0.125(t-1.5)} times a sine function, the maximum value of this term is (16/sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125(t-1.5)}. The second term is smaller because it's at a larger t, so after tau, the second term becomes negligible, and the maximum is determined by the first term.

So, the maximum value of u(t) for t >=1.5 is (16/sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125(t-1.5)}. We can set this equal to 0.1 and solve for t to find tau.

Wait, but wait: the maximum of u(t) may not exactly be the maximum of the first term. It depends on when the sine function is at its maximum. Because sin(...) can be positive or negative, but the maximum of the function u(t) would be when the sine is maximum, which is 1, but multiplied by the exponential.

So, the maximum amplitude of u(t) is (16/sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125(t-1.5)}.

So, set this equal to 0.1 and solve for t:

(16 / sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125(t-1.5)} = 0.1

Let me compute 16 / sqrt(63). sqrt(63) is about 7.937, so 16/7.937 ≈ 2.011. So, 2.011 * e^{-0.125(t-1.5)} = 0.1.

Divide both sides by 2.011:

e^{-0.125(t-1.5)} = 0.1 / 2.011 ≈ 0.0497.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-0.125(t -1.5) = ln(0.0497) ≈ ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957.

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.125(t - 1.5) = 2.9957.

Divide both sides by 0.125:

t - 1.5 = 2.9957 / 0.125 ≈ 23.9656.

Add 1.5:

t ≈ 23.9656 + 1.5 = 25.4656.

Looking at the options, option B is 25.4656. So, perhaps the answer is B.

Wait, but let me check my steps again.

1. I wrote the Laplace transform correctly.

2. Broke it into F(s) as 1/(s² +0.25 s +1).

3. Computed F(s) in terms of exponentials and sine functions, leading to the inverse Laplace.

4. Identified that the maximum value of u(t) is the maximum of the first term, which is (16 / sqrt(63)) e^{-0.125(t-1.5)}.

5. Set this equal to 0.1 and solved for t.

6. Calculated t ≈25.4656, which is option B.

So, I think the answer is B.

The problem involves solving a spring-mass system with a step function forcing. The solution involves Laplace transforms, inverse transforms, and analyzing the system's behavior.

1. **Laplace Transform**: The differential equation in the Laplace domain is solved using the Laplace transform of the step function and algebraic manipulation.

2. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform is computed using standard forms and properties of Laplace transforms, leading to an expression involving exponentially decaying sine functions.

3. **Behavior of the Solution**: The solution exhibits an oscillatory behavior with exponentially decaying amplitude due to the underdamped nature of the system. The maximum amplitude of the oscillations is determined by the decaying exponential term.

4. **Setting the Amplitude**: To find the time τ after which the amplitude of the oscillations drops below 0.1, we set the maximum amplitude equal to 0.1 and solve for τ.

5. **Solution Calculation**: After computing the time τ, we find that τ is approximately 25.4656, which corresponds to option B.
