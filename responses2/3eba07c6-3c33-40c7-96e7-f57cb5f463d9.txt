Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let me read it again. It says that X has a normal distribution with a mean of 9 and a standard deviation of 3. I need to find the probability that X is between 5 and 11, right? So P(5 < X < 11). Hmm, okay, I remember that for normal distributions, we can use the z-score formula to standardize the values and then use the standard normal distribution table.

First, I think I should calculate the z-scores for both 5 and 11. The formula for z is (X - μ)/σ. So for X =5, that's (5-9)/3. Let me compute that. 5 minus 9 is -4, divided by 3 is approximately -1.333. And for X=11, it's (11-9)/3, which is 2/3, about 0.6667.

Now, I need to find the area under the standard normal curve between z = -1.333 and z = 0.6667. Wait, but maybe it's easier to find the area from z = -1.333 to 0 and then add the area from 0 to 0.6667. Or perhaps I can use a calculator or a table. Oh right, since I'm working this out, I might remember some standard values or approximate them.

I recall that for z = -1.33 (which is approximately -1.333), the cumulative probability up to that point is about 0.09176. Wait, no, wait. Wait, because z = -1.33 is in the left tail. So the probability for z = -1.33 is the area to the left of -1.33, which is 0.09176. But wait, I'm looking for the area between -1.33 and 0.6667. So the area from -1.33 to 0 is the difference between 0.5 (since it's a normal distribution, 0 to the right of the mean) and 0.09176. So 0.5 - 0.09176 = 0.40824. Then, the area from 0 to 0.6667 is the cumulative probability up to 0.6667 minus 0.5. What's the cumulative at 0.6667? I think that's approximately 0.7486, so 0.7486 - 0.5 = 0.2486. Adding these two parts together: 0.40824 + 0.2486 = 0.65684. Hmm, but wait, none of the options exactly match that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me look at them. Option E is 0.65361, which is close to what I got. But maybe I made an approximation error. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise z-score values.

Wait, let me get more accurate z-values. For z = -1.33, the cumulative probability is actually about 0.09176 (so the area to the left of -1.33 is 0.09176). Then the area from -1.33 to 0 is 0.5 - 0.09176 = 0.40824. For z = 0.6667, the cumulative is higher. Let me think, the standard normal table says that for z=0.66, the area is about 0.7460, and for z=0.67, it's 0.7486. So for 0.6667, let me approximate it as 0.7486. So 0.7486 - 0.5 = 0.2486. So adding 0.40824 + 0.2486 gives 0.65684. That's approximately 0.6568, but the option E is 0.65361. Hmm, that's a bit lower. Did I make a mistake in the approximation? Or perhaps the exact calculation needs more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator or more precise z-values. Let me try using a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the exact area.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact probabilities using the error function or something, but that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the standard normal distribution function. Let's calculate the probability between -1.333 and 0.6667. Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, perhaps I can find the area for each side.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the area between two z-scores: P(a < Z < b) = Φ(b) - Φ(a), where Φ is the standard normal CDF.

So Φ(0.6667) minus Φ(-1.333). Let me compute these.

Φ(0.6667) is approximately 0.7486. Φ(-1.333) is approximately 0.09176. So subtracting, 0.7486 - 0.09176 = 0.65684.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option E is 0.65361. So that's approximately 0.6536. So why the discrepancy?

Hmm, perhaps my approximations were off. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact probability using a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the exact value is around 0.6536, which is option E.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should use more precise z-scores. Let me think about the exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me recheck.

X has mean 9, σ 3.

P(5 < X <11) --> Z-scores for 5 is (5-9)/3 = (-4)/3 ≈ -1.3333.

For 11, (11-9)/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

So the probability is Φ(0.6667) - Φ(-1.3333).

I think Φ(0.6667) is approximately 0.7486, and Φ(-1.3333) is approximately 0.09176. So 0.7486 - 0.09176 = 0.65684.

Wait, that's about 0.6568, but the closest option is E) 0.65361, which is a bit lower. Hmm, so perhaps my approximations are off. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the exact value is 0.6536, which is option E. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use more precise z-score values. For example, for z = -1.3333, the exact CDF value can be found using a calculator or more accurate tables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the symmetry of the normal distribution. Let me think:

The area from -1.333 to 0 is 0.5 - 0.09176 = 0.40824.

The area from 0 to 0.6667 is 0.7486 - 0.5 = 0.2486.

Adding them gives 0.65684. So about 0.6568. But the options don't have this. The closest is E) 0.65361. Hmm, that's a small difference. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the exact value is 0.6536, which is option E. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the mean is 9, so 5 and 11 are 4 units below and above the mean, respectively. So perhaps the area is a bit more than 0.5, but not too much. So the options are from 0.377 to 0.928. Hmm, the correct answer is around 0.65, which is option E. So I think the correct answer is E.

The correct answer is E: 0.65361.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the distribution and parameters:**  
   X follows a normal distribution with mean μ = 9 and standard deviation σ = 3.

2. **Convert to z-scores:**  
   For X = 5: z = (5 - 9)/3 = -1.3333.  
   For X = 11: z = (11 - 9)/3 = 0.6667.

3. **Find the cumulative probabilities:**  
   Use the standard normal distribution to find Φ(0.6667) ≈ 0.7486 and Φ(-1.3333) ≈ 0.09176.

4. **Calculate the probability between the z-scores:**  
   P(5 < X < 11) = Φ(0.6667) - Φ(-1.3333) ≈ 0.7486 - 0.09176 = 0.65684.

5. **Compare with options:**  
   The closest option to 0.65684 is E: 0.65361.
