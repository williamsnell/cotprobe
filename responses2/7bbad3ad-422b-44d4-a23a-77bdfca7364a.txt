Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Mr. Kohlberg and his flower shop. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Mr. Kohlberg starts the day with 152 roses. He sells 96 of them. Then, he wants to split the remaining roses equally into 8 vases. The question is, how many roses will each vase have? There are six options to choose from, labeled A to J.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, he starts with 152 roses. He sells 96, so I need to subtract 96 from 152 to find out how many he has left. 

So, 152 minus 96. Hmm, doing the subtraction. Let me calculate: 152 - 96.

I can think of 152 as 150 + 2. Subtracting 96, which is 90 + 6: 150 -90 is 60, and 2 -6 is negative. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, maybe I can subtract 90 first, which gives 62, then subtract 6 more, which gives 56. So 152 -96 equals 56.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 152 minus 96. Let me do it another way. 96 plus what equals 152? Let's see, 96 plus 5 is 101, plus 50 is 151, plus 1 is 152. That's 56. Yep, so 152 -96 is 56.

So after selling 96 roses, he has 56 left. Now, he wants to separate these equally into 8 vases. So each vase will have 56 divided by 8.

56 divided by 8. Let me think, 8 times 7 is 56, so 56/8 is 7. So each vase will have 7 roses.

Looking at the options, option H is 7, so the answer should be H.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any errors. So the steps are: 152 minus 96 is 56, then 56 divided by 8 is 7.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is 7 roses per vase.

Answer: H
