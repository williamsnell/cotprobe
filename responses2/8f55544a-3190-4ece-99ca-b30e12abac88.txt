Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about philosophy and life tasks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking which theory aligns with the idea that there are three major life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. The options are a bunch of names like Perls, Maslow, etc. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to recall what each theory is about.

First, I remember that there are several theories in psychology that discuss various life stages and goals. The options given are all theories, so I need to match each to their respective concepts.

The question mentions three life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. These are often referred to as the Three Tasks or the Three Big Goals. I think the theory that explains these is Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Yeah, Maslow's theory states that humans have a hierarchy of basic needs, and beyond basic survival, each level adds more important aspects. The first level is basic needs like food and water, then higher levels like love, relationships, safety, security, and finally self-actualization.

So, in that case, the three major tasks would correspond to the lower levels: love, friendship, and occupation. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact order. The first level is survival and safety, then love, relationships, security, then self-actualization. So the three major tasks might be love, occupation, and security. But the question lists friendship, occupation, and love. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the tasks are in a different order. Or maybe the question is just using these as the standard three. Let me think again. The three biggest needs are survival, safety, love, and then relationships, security, and finally self-actualization. So the first three tasks could be love, relationships, security. But in the question, the three are friendship, occupation, and love.

Wait, perhaps the order isn't the concern here. The question is about the concept. So the idea that these three are considered life tasks is associated with Maslow's theory. So the correct answer would be B: Maslow.

Alternatively, I should check each option to be sure. Let me think about each theory.

Perls: I don't think that's it. Maybe he's about cycles of success and failure? Or perhaps he's about identity, but I'm not sure.

Erikson: He talked about the stages of development, like the primary, secondary, and tertiary stages. The primary is about curiosity and exploration, leading to the secondary which is family, and tertiary is seeking power and control. Not sure how that ties to life tasks.

Piaget: Developmental stages. Concepts like sensorimotor, preempirical, etc. Not directly about life tasks.

Rogers: He was about identity and purpose. The concept of the self and identity. Not sure if that's the same as the three tasks.

Berne: That's the theory about the three stages of development: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Wait, the Berne theory is the same as Erikson's stages. So the three stages are the same as in the question. But that's about development, not life tasks. So I don't think that's the answer.

Adler: He talked about identity and self-actualization. He suggested that people have to define their identity, but I don't recall the three tasks being his main focus.

Bandura: He's about behaviorism and social learning. Not sure how that ties to life tasks.

Freud: He dealt with identity and sexual desire. Not really about life tasks.

Jung: He's about personality types and development. Not matching.

So, the only theory that directly relates to the three major life tasks is Maslow's. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Maslow.

The correct answer is B: Maslow.

The three major life tasks—friendship, occupation, and love—are best explained by Maslow's theory of needs. This theory posits a hierarchy of basic psychological needs, with the first three levels being survival and safety, love, and relationships, followed by security, safety, and self-actualization. The question's focus on these tasks aligns with Maslow's framework, making the correct response Maslow.

Answer: B
