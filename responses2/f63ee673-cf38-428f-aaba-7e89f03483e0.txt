Okay, so I have this problem here: Samantha has 342 baseball cards, and Perry has 184. The question is asking how many more cards Samantha has than Perry. Hmm, I need to find the difference between their two numbers.

Let me think about how to calculate that. I remember from school that when you want to find out how much more one thing is compared to another, you subtract the smaller number from the larger one. So, in this case, I should subtract Perry's number from Samantha's.

So, Samantha's cards are 342, and Perry's are 184. Subtracting 184 from 342. Let me write that down: 342 minus 184. Let me do the subtraction step by step. 

342 minus 100 is 242. Then, subtract 80 more: 242 minus 80 is 162. Then subtract 4: 162 minus 4 is 158. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 158 isn't one of the options I remember. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my subtraction.

Let me try another approach. Maybe I can start from 184 and add up to 342. So, 184 plus 100 is 284. Then plus 60 is 344. Oh wait, that's over 342. So 184 plus 158 would be 342? Wait, no, let me check. 184 plus 158: 184 + 100 is 284, plus 50 is 334, plus 8 is 342. Oh, so 184 + 158 = 342. So the difference is 158. So that would mean Samantha has 158 more cards. Looking at the options, option D is 158. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but another way to check: 342 - 184. Let's do it more methodically. Subtract each digit starting from the right. 2 minus 4 can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. The tens place is 4, so it becomes 3, and the units become 12. 12 minus 4 is 8. Then, the tens place is 3 minus 8. Again, can't do, so borrow from the hundreds. The hundreds digit is 3, so it becomes 2, and the tens become 13. 13 minus 8 is 5. Finally, subtract the hundreds: 2 minus 1 is 1. So the result is 158. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is D, 158.
