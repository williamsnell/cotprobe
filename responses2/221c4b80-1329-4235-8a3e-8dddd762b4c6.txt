Question:

Consider a periodic signal $x(t)$ with period $(T)$ equals to ten. Over one period (i.e., $-5 \leq t<5)$, it is defined as $$ x(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 2 & -5 \leq t<0 \\ -2 & 0 \leq t<5 \end{array}\right. $$ In Fourier series, the signal $x(t)$ is written in the form of $$ x(t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{\frac{j 2 \pi k t}{T}} $$ where the Fourier series coefficient $c_k$ is obtained as, $$ c_k=\frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x(t) e^{-\frac{j 2 \pi k t}{T}} d t $$ Determine the value of $c_0$ (i.e., $\left.k=0\right)$

Options:

A: 1
B: 3
C: 2
D: -3
E: 0
F: -1

Okay, so I've got this Fourier series problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the Fourier coefficient c₀ for a periodic signal x(t). The signal has a period T which is 10. The definition of x(t) is given as 2 from -5 to 0, then -2 from 0 to 5. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, the period is 10, so each period is 10 units. So the function is defined over -5 to 5, but that's one period. Right.

The formula for c_k is given, and specifically c₀ is when k=0. The formula for c_k is (1/T) times the integral from -T/2 to T/2 of x(t) times e^(-j 2π k t / T) dt. But for c₀, k is 0, so the exponential term becomes 1. So c₀ will be (1/T) times the integral of x(t) over one period.

Wait a second, let me double-check. The integral is from -T/2 to T/2, but since the period is 10, T/2 is 5. So the integral is from -5 to 5. Yes, that makes sense because the function is defined over that interval.

So the integral becomes the sum of two parts. Because x(t) is 2 from -5 to 0, and -2 from 0 to 5. So the integral from -5 to 0 is 2 dt, and from 0 to 5 is -2 dt.

Let me write it down: 

c₀ = (1/10) * [ ∫_{-5}^0 2 dt + ∫_{0}^5 (-2) dt ]

Calculating each part. The first integral is 2 times (0 - (-5)) = 2*5=10. The second integral is -2 times (5-0)= -2*5= -10. So adding them together: 10 -10 =0.

Then multiply by 1/10: 0 /10 =0.

So c₀ is zero. Looking at the options, E is 0. So the answer should be E.

To determine the value of \( c_0 \) for the given periodic signal \( x(t) \), we use the formula for the Fourier series coefficient:

\[
c_k = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x(t) e^{-\frac{j 2 \pi k t}{T}} dt
\]

For \( k = 0 \), the exponential term becomes 1, and \( c_0 \) simplifies to:

\[
c_0 = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x(t) dt
\]

Given \( T = 10 \), the limits of integration are from \( -5 \) to \( 5 \). The function \( x(t) \) is defined as \( 2 \) from \( -5 \leq t < 0 \) and \( -2 \) from \( 0 \leq t < 5 \):

\[
c_0 = \frac{1}{10} \left[ \int_{-5}^{0} 2 \, dt + \int_{0}^{5} (-2) \, dt \right]
\]

Calculating each integral:

\[
\int_{-5}^{0} 2 \, dt = 2 \cdot (0 - (-5)) = 10
\]
\[
\int_{0}^{5} (-2) \, dt = -2 \cdot (5 - 0) = -10
\]

Adding them:

\[
c_0 = \frac{1}{10} (10 - 10) = 0
\]

Thus, \( c_0 = 0 \). The correct answer is:

**E: 0**
