Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about electromagnetic radiation and their wavelengths. The question is asking which type has the longest wavelength. The options are A through J, each representing different types. 

Hmm, I think I remember that electromagnetic radiation has different types based on their wavelengths. Shorter wavelengths correspond to higher energy. So, the question is asking for the longest wavelength, which would mean the lowest energy among those listed.

Let me list the options again to visualize: A is microwaves, B is red light, C is radio waves, D is gamma rays, E is X-rays, F is infrared, G is orange light, H is blue light, I is ultraviolet, and J is yellow light.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact order. Let me think. I know that the electromagnetic spectrum is ordered from longest wavelength to shortest in the following way: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light (which includes blue, green, red), X-rays, then gamma rays. Oh wait, but wait, isn't gamma rays the highest energy and thus the shortest wavelength? Oh right, because the energy increases as we go to higher frequencies, which correspond to shorter wavelengths.

So the order from longest to shortest wavelength is: radio waves (C) > microwaves (A) > infrared (F) > visible light (G, H, B) > X-rays (E) > gamma rays (D). So the longest wavelength would be radio waves, which is option C. Because microwaves are longer than infrared, which is longer than visible light, etc.

Wait wait, wait. Let me check again. Oh yeah, because the order is radio waves (longest) to gamma rays (shortest). So among the options given, option C is radio waves.

The electromagnetic spectrum ranges from radio waves (longest wavelength) to gamma rays (shortest wavelength). Among the options provided:

- **C: Radio waves** are the longest wavelength, followed by microwaves, infrared, visible light, X-rays, and gamma rays. 

Thus, the correct answer is **C: Radio waves**. 

Answer: C
