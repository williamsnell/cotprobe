Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the molecular formula of a gas. Let me see. Alright, the question says the molecular weight is 58, and it contains 82.8% C and 17.2% H. So, I need to find out what the molecular formula is from these percentages.

Hmm, wait, molecular formula is the actual number of each atom in a molecule, right? So I need to figure out the ratio of C and H in the compound. But wait, molecular formulas are based on the actual number of atoms, not the percentage. Oh wait no, actually molecular formula is determined by the percentages and the molecular weight. So the percentages can help find the ratio of atoms.

So the first step is to find the mass of each element in the compound. Since the percentages are given, I can assume a 100g sample. So 82.8g is carbon, 17.2g is hydrogen. 

Next, I'll calculate the moles of each element. Moles are calculated as mass divided by atomic weight. So for carbon: 82.8g / atomic weight of C. Wait, what's the atomic weight of carbon? Oh right, about 12.01 g/mol. So moles of C = 82.8 /12.01 ≈ 6.89 moles.

Hydrogen: 17.2g / 1.008 g/mol ≈ 17.06 moles.

Wait, wait, that's a lot of moles. Now I need to find the simplest whole number ratio between the moles of C and H. So I'll divide both by the smaller number of moles. Carbon is about 6.89, hydrogen is like 17.06. So 6.89 is the smaller.

So, C: 6.89 /6.89 = 1. H: 17.06 /6.89 ≈ 2.48.

Hmm, 2.48 is a bit over 2, but close to 2.5. So maybe the ratio is approximately 1 C to 2.5 H. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps I need to multiply both by 2 to get whole numbers. Let me see: 1 * 2=2, 2.5 *2=5. So the ratio would be 2 C and 5 H. So the formula would be C2H5. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait wait, but wait a minute. The molecular weight must match the molecular formula. The molecular formula is C_x H_y, so the actual formula would be (x *12.01) + (y *1.008) = 58 g/mol.

Let me calculate the molecular weight for C2H5. That's (2*12.01) + (5*1.008) = 24.02 +5.04=29.06 g/mol. That's way below 58. So something's wrong here.

Oh, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me go back. Carbon's moles are about 6.89, H is 17.06. The ratio is about 1:2.48. Oh wait, 2.48 is approximately 2.5. So if I take that, perhaps I can multiply by 4 to get whole numbers. Wait 2.48 is about 2.5, so multiplying both by 4 would give 10 and 10. So the ratio would be 1 C and 10 H? Let me check that.

Wait, wait, 2.48 is roughly 2.5. If I take that ratio and multiply both by 4, we get 1 (C) and 10 (H). So the formula would be C1H10. What's the molecular weight of that? 12 +10=22. That's still way below 58. So that's a problem. Hmm. Maybe I should check my initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me recalculate the moles. Carbon: 82.8g /12.01 is approximately 6.89 moles. H: 17.2g /1.008 is approximately 17.06. So that's correct.

Wait another thought. Maybe the percentages are given in a different way. Oh wait, perhaps it's 82.8% by mass, but maybe there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is a multiple of the empirical formula.

Wait, wait. Another way: let's calculate the moles again accurately.

Carbon: 82.8 /12.01 = let's compute it more precisely. 12 * 6 =72, 82.8 is 72 + 10.8. So 10.8 /12 is 0.9. So 6.9 moles. So 6.9 moles of C.

H: 17.2 /1.008 = let's compute 1.008 *17 = 17.136. 17.2 is 0.064 more. So 0.064 /1.008 ≈ 0.0635. So 17.2 /1.008 ≈17.136 +0.0635=17.20. So approx 17.20 moles H.

So moles C: ~6.9, H: ~17.2.

So the ratio is H / C: 17.2 /6.9 ≈ 2.507. So approximately 2.5. So maybe the ratio is H : C = 10 :4, as 10/4=2.5. So the ratio is 2.5, which is 5/2. So 5 and 2. So that would give the formula C4H10. Because 4 carbons and 10 hydrogens.

Wait, let me compute that: C4H10. Molecular weight is 4*12 +10*1=48+10=58. Oh wait, that's exactly the molecular weight given. So the molecular formula is C4H10. Looking at the options, option C is C4H8, option G is C4H10. So the correct answer should be option G.

To determine the molecular formula of the gas, we start by analyzing the given data. The gas has a molecular weight of 58 g/mol, contains 82.8% carbon (C) and 17.2% hydrogen (H). Assuming a 100 g sample, this corresponds to 82.8 g of C and 17.2 g of H.

Next, we calculate the moles of each element:

- Moles of C = \( \frac{82.8 \, \text{g}}{12.01 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 6.89 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of H = \( \frac{17.2 \, \text{g}}{1.008 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 17.06 \, \text{mol} \)

The ratio of moles of C to H is:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{17.06}{6.89} \approx 2.48
\]

This ratio is approximately 2.5, which suggests the simplest whole number ratio of C to H is 1:2.5. To express this as a ratio of whole numbers, we can multiply both by 4, giving a ratio of 4:10. Thus, the empirical formula is \( \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10} \).

Finally, we verify the molecular weight of \( \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10} \):

\[
\text{Molecular weight} = (4 \times 12.01) + (10 \times 1.008) = 48.04 + 10.08 = 58.12 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

This matches the given molecular weight of 58 g/mol. Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is \( \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10} \).
