Okay, so I have this question about the existence of premodern Homo sapiens. I'm a bit rusty on my paleontology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists various time periods, and I remember that the last common ancestor of humans and Neanderthals lived around 100,000 to 600,000 years ago. That's the so-called "M Near East" period. But wait, the options given are more specific. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:
A: 500,000 to 100,000 years ago.
B: 800,000 to 200,000 years ago.
C: 200,000 to 50,000 years ago.
D: 700,000 to 40,000 years ago.
E: 600,000 to 30,000 years ago.
F: 100,000 to 10,000 years ago.
G: 1,000,000 to 500,000 years ago.
H: 900,000 to 10,000 years ago.
I: 400,000 to 10,000 years ago.
J: 300,000 to 20,000 years ago.

I think the correct answer is J: 300,000 to 20,000 years ago. Because I remember that this interval is known as the "M Near East period" and it's when both humans and Neanderthals lived together. But wait, the exact time frame could vary. Some sources say it's roughly 600,000 to 300,000 years ago, but perhaps some might include more recent data.

Wait, another thought: I think the last common ancestor was around 100,000 to 600,000. But the question is about the time when premodern humans existed, meaning humans were around but Neanderthals were gone. So the split between humans and Neanderthals would have occurred around 600,000 years ago. But the timeframe for the last common ancestor is from about 100,000 to 600,000. So premodern Homo sapiens would have been around from maybe 400,000 to 10,000 years ago, but perhaps the latest I can get is 300,000 to 20,000, which is option J.

So according to the options given, J is 300,000 to 20,000. That seems correct.

The correct answer is J: 300,000 to 20,000 years ago. This interval aligns with the known "M Near East period," where humans and Neanderthals coexisted. The split between humans and Neanderthals occurred around 600,000 to 300,000 years ago, making the timeframe for premodern Homo sapiens from 300,000 to 20,000 years ago the most accurate option.

Answer: J
