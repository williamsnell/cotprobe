Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium problem. Let's see, the question is about an X-linked recessive disorder. I remember that in X-linked diseases, males are affected if they have one bad allele, since they don't have two X's to pass on like females do. Females need two copies, so they have to be homozygous.

The problem states that the incidence in males is 1 in 100. So that's like 1% of males affected. Since males have only one X chromosome, their condition is codominant with the other X (if any). Wait, no, in recessive disorders, males only need one copy. So the incidence in males is the frequency of the recessive allele on the X.

Let me think about the Hardy-Weinberg formula. For X-linked recessive, the formula is a bit different. I think the frequency of the recessive allele (let's call it 'q') is the incidence in males. So q = 1/100 = 0.01.

Since the disease is recessive, the heterozygous carriers (males without the disorder) won't show it, so their frequency is 2q (but wait, in males, since they have only one X, the frequency of the allele is q. So for males: q = 1/100.

Now, the question is about the incidence of affected homozygous females. So we're looking for females who have two copies of the recessive allele. 

In females, the Hardy-Weinberg equation is p² + 2pq + q², but since the disease is recessive, they only express the disease if both copies are recessive. So the affected females have genotype q². The frequency of that would be q squared.

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure. Since the disorder is recessive, males have one X. So if they have one, they have the disease. Females have two X's. So if a female is homozygous recessive (q²), then both X chromosomes are recessive, meaning she has the disorder.

So the frequency of affected females is q². q is 0.01, so q squared is 0.0001. That's 1 in 10,000. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the question says the incidence in males is 1 in 100. So q = 0.01. Then for females, the frequency of the disease is q² = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000. But wait, the options don't have 1 in 10,000. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A is 1 in 10,000. So that would be the choice. But wait, the question is about the expected incidence of affected homozygous females. So, yes, 1 in 10,000 would be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The options include J: 1 in 4000, which is 0.00025. Hmm, so are there any factors I'm missing? Like the assumption that males don't carry the allele, but since it's X-linked, the frequency of the allele is 1% in males, which is correct.

Wait, another point: in the population, how are the allele frequencies distributed? Because in X-linked recessive diseases, males are affected if they have the allele, and females are affected only if they have two copies.

So for females, the probability that both X's are recessive is q squared, which is 1% squared, which is 0.01^2 = 0.0001. So 1 in 10,000.

Looking at the options, option A is 1 in 10,000. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "the expected incidence of affected homozygous females." So affected females are those who have two recessive alleles, i.e., q².

Hence, the expected incidence is q^2, which is 0.01 * 0.01 =0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000. So the answer is A.

The question involves determining the incidence of affected homozygous females in an X-linked recessive disorder where the incidence in males is 1 in 100. In X-linked diseases, males are affected if they have one recessive allele, while females are affected only if they are homozygous recessive (i.e., both alleles are recessive). 

The frequency of the recessive allele (q) in males is given as 1 in 100, so \( q = 0.01 \). The frequency of affected females (homozygous recessive) is calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation for females: \( q^2 \). Substituting the value of \( q \), we get:

\[
q^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001
\]

This corresponds to an incidence of 1 in 10,000. Among the given options, the correct answer is **A: 1 in 10,000**.
