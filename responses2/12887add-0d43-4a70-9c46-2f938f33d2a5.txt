Okay, so I've got this question here about the relative intensities of the secondary maxima in a single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction pattern. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me try to think this through.

Wait, I remember that when light passes through a single slit, it creates a diffraction pattern with several maxima and minima. The primary maximum is the brightest, and then there are secondary maxima that get weaker (they're called secondary because they're the next set after the primary). But I'm not entirely sure about the exact details, so I need to work this out.

I think the intensity of the secondary maxima depends on the order of the maxima. Like, the first secondary maximum is the first one after the primary, then the second, and so on. Each of these maxima has a different intensity relative to the primary.

I remember that the intensity of the maxima in a single-slit diffraction pattern has a specific formula. Oh right, the intensity I is proportional to (sin(β) / β)^2, where β is (π a sinθ)/λ, and 'a' is the slit width, 'θ' is the angle from the central maximum, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, so the primary maximum is when sinθ is small, like when θ is very small (near the central peak). The first secondary maximum would be the first place where sinβ is zero again, but wait, no, that's not right. Because β is (π a sinθ)/λ. So sinβ is zero when β is an integer multiple of π. So β=π, 2π, 3π, etc. So when sinθ is such that π a sinθ/λ = nπ, where n is an integer. So sinθ = nλ/(a). So sinθ is nλ/a. So the angles where the minima occur are given by θ_n = arcsin(nλ/a).

But wait, the intensity of the secondary maxima—how do I find that? I think the intensity is given by I_n proportional to sin^2(nθ) / (n θ)^2, where θ is the angle for the nth minimum. Or wait, maybe it's different. Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the patterns. The maxima occur when sinβ is maximum. But how are the maxima and minima distributed? The primary maximum is when β is approximately zero (nearly straight through), and then the minima occur at the first order (n=1, 2,...), right? But the secondary maxima are the next ones after the first minimum.

Wait, perhaps the secondary maxima are the peaks immediately next to the minima. So each secondary maximum corresponds to a point where the minima are, but not the very first one. So for example, the first minimum is at β=π, the next at 2π, then 3π, etc. But the secondary maxima are the peaks that come after these minima. So the first secondary maximum is at β=2π, the next at 4π, and so on.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think: the maxima are the peaks between the minima. So each pair of minima creates a peak. The first peak after the central maximum is the first secondary maximum. So the first secondary maximum occurs when β is π, the next when β is 3π, then 5π, etc. So these are the points where the minima are (n=1,2,3...), but the maxima are between them.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The formula for the intensity is I = I_0 [ (sin β) / (β) ]^2, where β = (π a sinθ)/λ.

The maxima occur when sinβ is maximum, which is when β is an integer multiple of π. So the maxima are at β=0, π, 2π, 3π, etc. But the minima occur between these maxima. Because sinβ is zero at β=π, 2π, 3π, etc., so those are the points where the intensity drops to zero. So the minima are at θ_n = arcsin(nλ/a), where n is an integer.

Wait, so each minimum is at θ_n = arcsin(nλ/a), and the maxima are at β = mπ, where m is an integer. So the maxima occur at θ_m = arcsin(mλ/a), but the actual minima are at theta between these. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the maxima and minima are separated by half a wavelength in β. So if a minimum is at β = mπ, then the next maximum is at β = (m + 0.5) π. So the first minimum is at β=π, the first maximum after that is at β=1.5 π, the next is at β=2.5 π, and so on. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's think again.

The points where the intensity is a maximum (I_max) occur when sinβ is maximum, which is when β = mπ, where m is an integer (m=0,1,2,3,...). So m=0 is the central maximum, m=1 is the first secondary maximum (since it's the first after the central), m=2 is the second secondary maximum, etc.

So the intensity of each secondary maximum is proportional to (sin(m π))^2 / (m π)^2. But sin(m π) is zero for integer m, which doesn't make sense. Wait, but that can't be right because the maxima are the points where sinβ is maximum, but for β = mπ, sin β is zero, implying I=0, which contradicts. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the intensity in terms of the order n, where the nth secondary maximum is at a certain β. Let's see. The first secondary maximum (n=1) occurs between the first two minima. Wait, no—wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, here's another approach: The intensity of each secondary maximum is approximately I ~ 1/(n^2), where n is the order of the maximum. So the first secondary maximum is about 1/3 of the intensity of the first maximum, the second is about 1/(3^2) = 1/9, and so on.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think about the exact formula. The intensity of the maxima is given by (sin β)/(β)^2, where β is as defined before. But the intensity is maximum when β is a multiple of π. But between these, the minima occur at β = n π, and the maxima are at β = (n + 0.5) π.

So for each maximum, the order is n, and the angle is (n + 0.5) π / something.

But perhaps for small angles (which is the case for Fraunhofer diffraction where θ is small), we can approximate. Because the maxima are for small angles, so we can use the approximation sinθ ≈ θ (in radians). Then beta = (π a sinθ)/λ ≈ (π a θ)/λ.

But when θ is small, sinβ ≈ beta, so the intensity I = (sin beta / beta)^2 ≈ (beta/beta)^2 = 1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait no, perhaps not. Because beta is a function of theta, and when theta is small, beta is small. So (sin beta / beta) is approximately 1. So the intensity is approximately 1 in that case. But that can't be right because the maxima are more intense than the minima.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The exact formula is I = I_0 [ (sin β) / β ]^2. For small angles, β is small, so sin β ≈ β. So (sin beta / beta) ≈ 1, so [1]^2 = 1. Hence, the intensity is approximately 1 for small angles, which matches the first maximum being the brightest.

But for the secondary maxima, which are the next set after the primary. Wait, no—secondary maxima are the peaks that appear between the minima. So for example, the first secondary maximum is the first peak after the central maximum, which would be higher than the first minimum.

But according to the formula, the intensity of the secondary maxima depends on the order n. Let me try to find the formula for the intensity of each maximum.

The intensity of the maxima is given by I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ) ) / (n π) ]^2. But wait, sin(nπ) is zero, which can't be right. That can't be the case because the intensity of the maxima can't be zero. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ) ) / (nπ) ]^2. But sin(nπ) is zero, which would make I_n zero, which is incorrect. So that's a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the intensity of the n-th secondary maximum is proportional to (1/n^2). Because the first secondary maximum is at n=1, the second at n=2, etc. So I_1 ≈ 0.203 (I think), I_2 ≈ 0.043, I_3 ≈ 0.023, and so on. But I'm not exactly certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the intensities are inversely proportional to the square of the order. So the first secondary maximum is about (1/3) the intensity of the first maximum, the second is about (1/9), the third is (1/27), etc. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, I remember that the intensity of the secondary maxima in a single-slit diffraction pattern decreases as 1/n², where n is the order of the maximum. So the first (n=1) secondary maximum is about 0.203 times the peak intensity, the second (n=2) is about 0.043, the third (n=3) about 0.023, etc.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because the first maximum is the central maximum, which is the brightest. The first secondary maximum is the first peak right after that, which is bigger than the central peak but less than the first minimum. So according to that, the first secondary maximum's intensity should be higher than the central maximum, but lower than the first minimum.

Wait, no, the secondary maxima are the peaks that appear between the minima. The central maximum is the brightest, and then the first secondary maximum is a smaller peak. Then the first minimum is in between.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the intensity distribution.

In the single-slit diffraction pattern, the intensity distribution has a central peak (primary maximum) and then smaller secondary maxima and minima that get smaller as you go further out. The intensity of each secondary maximum is approximately I_0 [ (sin(nπ) ) / (nπ) ]^2, but wait, that's zero because sin(n π) = 0.

So that approach isn't correct. Another approach: perhaps the maxima occur when sinβ is maximum, which is at β = mπ, but for the maxima, the intensity is maximum when β is zero (m=0), and for the secondary maxima, the intensity is given by I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ) ) / (nπ) ]^2, but again, that gives zero, which is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is different. Maybe I'm confusing the order of the maxima.

Alternatively, I've read that in a single-slit diffraction pattern, the intensity of the secondary maxima is approximately 1/(n^2) times the intensity of the central maximum, where n is the order of the maximum. So the first secondary maximum (n=1) is about 0.2 (approx 1/5) of the central maximum, the second (n=2) is about 1/18 (approx 0.055), third is about 1/81 (approx 0.0123), etc.

Wait, but that seems too low for the first order. Let me think about the actual intensity distribution. The central maximum is the brightest. The first secondary maximum is a smaller peak (about 1/5 of the central maximum?), the second is about 1/18, etc. So the intensity ratios would be:

I_0: I_1: I_2: I_3:...

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a formula that gives the intensity of the secondary maxima.

Another approach: I remember that the intensity of the secondary maxima (n-th order) is approximately I_n = I_0 [ (sin(θ_n) ) / (θ_n) ]^2, where θ_n is the angle for the n-th secondary maximum. But θ is small, so θ ≈ β, so sinθ ≈ θ. So sin(theta_n)/theta_n ≈ 1, which again suggests that I_n ≈ I_0. But that's not correct because the secondary maxima are less intense than the central maximum.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Perhaps the correct formula is I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ)) / (nπ) ]^2. But since sin(nπ) is zero, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different, like I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ/2) ) / (nπ/2) ]^2.

Wait, I think I remember that the intensity of the secondary maxima in a single-slit diffraction is given by I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ) ) / (n (π/2)) ) ]^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is I_n = (I_0) * [ (sin(nπ) ) / (nπ) ]^2, but again, that gives zero for integer n.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should recall that each secondary maximum is approximately 1/(n²) of the intensity of the first maximum. So the first (n=1) is 1/3 (approx 0.333), second (n=2) is 1/18 (approx 0.055), third (n=3) is 1/81 (approx 0.0123), and so on.

Wait, but wait, for n=1, 1/3 of the central maximum's intensity. For n=2, 1/18, and so on. So if the central maximum is I0, then the first secondary is about 0.333 I0, the second 0.055 I0, the third 0.0123 I0.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which option has these numbers.

Looking at the options:

A: 0.035, 0.014, 0.0070

Hmm, 0.035 is about 1/30, which is close to 1/30.0.

Option B: 0.030, 0.012, 0.0060 → 0.030 is close to 1/33.333.

Option C: 0.045, 0.016, 0.0083 → 0.045 is about 1/22, 0.016 is around 1/62.5 (≈0.016), 0.0083=1/120.

Wait, but wait: let me calculate 1/3, 1/18, 1/81.

1/3 is approximately 0.333.

1/18 is approx 0.0555.

1/81 is approximately 0.0123.

So the ratios are approx 1/3, 1/18, 1/81.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.035, 0.014, 0.0070. 0.035 is about 1/28.57, which is close to 1/30. 0.014 is approximately 0.014/0.035 = 0.4, which is roughly 1/2.5, which is 0.4. Hmm, but 0.014 is about 1/71.4, which is 1/(10*7.14) ≈ 0.014.

Wait, but if the first secondary is 0.035, that's 1/28.57, which is about 1/28.57 ≈ 0.035.

So option A's first three ratios are 0.035, 0.014, 0.007.

Wait, but for n=2, 1/18 is about 0.0555, which is higher than 0.014 in option A. So perhaps the option A is [0.035, 0.014, 0.007], which corresponds to 1/28.57, 1/71.4, 1/142.8.

Wait, but wait, option B is [0.030, 0.012, 0.0060]. So 0.03 is 1/33.33, 0.012 is 1/83.33, 0.006 is 1/166.66.

Hmm, but that's the inverse of the expected ratios. Because the first secondary should be higher than the first maximum. Wait, but the first secondary maximum is lower than the central maximum. No, wait, no. Central maximum is the brightest, then the first secondary is a smaller peak, then the first minimum is further out.

Wait, perhaps the order of the maxima is such that the first secondary is the first peak after the central maximum. So the first secondary would be the first maximum after the central, which is at a smaller intensity than the central. Wait, that can't be because the central is the brightest.

Wait, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think again of the intensity distribution. The central maximum is the brightest, then the first secondary maximum is a smaller peak (higher than the central?), then the first minimum is further out, and the next secondary maximum is even smaller.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The central maximum is the brightest. The first secondary maximum is a smaller peak than the central, but higher than the first minimum. Wait, but in reality, the first minimum is a dark spot, so the first secondary maximum is a peak that is lower than the first minimum.

Wait, perhaps the first secondary maximum is the first maximum after the central, but with a slightly lower intensity than the central. No, I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the relative intensities of the maxima. I've read that the first secondary maximum is about 0.203 times the first maximum, the second is about 0.043 times, the third about 0.023 times, etc. So the first secondary (n=1) is about 0.203, the second (n=2) is 0.043, the third (n=3) is 0.023, and so on.

But if the central maximum is I0, then the first secondary is I1 = I0 * 0.203, the second is I2 = I0 * 0.043, third I3= I0 * 0.023, etc.

So the ratios would be:

I1 : I0 = 0.203,

I2 : I0 = 0.043,

I3 : I0 = 0.023,

and so on.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.035, 0.014, 0.0070 → 0.035 is about 0.035 I0, which is close to 0.203 (n=1) ratio.

Wait, 0.035 is about 1/28.57, which is close to 0.203 (n=1) which is ~0.203.

So that's the first ratio, which would be the first secondary maximum.

The second ratio is 0.014, which would be I2 = 0.014 I0.

0.014 is about 0.014 / 0.035 = 0.4. So the second secondary maximum is about 0.4 times the first.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the second secondary maximum should be about 0.043 I0. So 0.043 is 0.043/0.035=1.228 times the first.

Hmm, so if the options don't have the correct ratios, perhaps I've made an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are using a different formula for the secondary maxima. For example, maybe the intensity is proportional to 1/(n^2), where n is the order of the maximum.

So first secondary (n=1): 0.25,

second (n=2): 0.125,

third (n=3): 0.0625,

and so on.

But that doesn't match with the options given.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: 0.035, 0.014, 0.0070 → ratios are 0.035 : 0.014 : 0.007.

Which is 5 : 1 : 0.1.

Hmm, that's not matching 1/3, 1/18, 1/81.

Option B: 0.030, 0.012, 0.0060 → ratio 5 : 1 : 0.1.

But the expected ratios are 0.203, 0.043, 0.023.

Option C: 0.045, 0.016, 0.0083 → 0.045 is about 0.045/0.035 = 1.285 times the first, but that doesn't fit.

Option D: 0.05, 0.015, 0.0075 → 0.05/0.035 = 1.428.

Hmm, none of these match the expected ratios.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the relative intensities of the secondary maxima compared to the central maximum, not the first maximum.

Wait, no, the question is about the secondary maxima in general, not just the first one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question provides the relative intensities of the secondary maxima in the order 1, 2, 3, etc., and the answer options list these in the same order.

So, for example, option A says the relative intensities are 0.035, 0.014, 0.007, which would correspond to I1/I0, I2/I0, I3/I0. So according to this, I1 is about 0.035 I0, which is approximately 0.203 times the central maximum. So perhaps the formula is that each secondary maximum's intensity is approximately 0.203 times the central maximum.

If that's the case, then option A, which has I1=0.035, I2=0.014, I3=0.007, would be correct.

But wait, how do I know that? Let me think of it another way. The intensity of the first secondary maximum is about 0.203 times the intensity of the central maximum. So if the central maximum is 1, the first secondary is 0.203, the second is 0.043, etc.

So relative intensities are 0.203, 0.043, 0.023, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.035, 0.014, 0.007 → 0.035 is about 0.035, which is about 0.203 for the first. But 0.035 is approximately 1/28.57, which is about 1/30, which is close to 0.203.

Wait, but 0.035 is 0.203 * 0.171, so not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I've been using the wrong formula. If the intensity of the secondary maxima is given by I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ)) / (nπ) ]^2, but that's zero because sin(nπ) is zero. So that can't be right.

Hmm, this is getting really confusing. Maybe I should try to look for the correct formula. Let me try to find a reliable source.

Upon checking, the intensity of the secondary maxima in a single-slit diffraction pattern is given by:

I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ) ) / (nπ) ]^2

But sin(nπ) is zero, so I_n = 0. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm confusing the formula with another.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is I_n = I_0 [ (sin(π/2 * n) ) / (π/2 * n) ]^2.

Let me compute that for n=1,2,3.

For n=1: (sin(π/2) )/(π/2) = 1/(π/2) = 2/π ≈0.6366. Squared is (2/pi)^2 ≈ 0.405. So I1 = I0 * 0.405.

For n=2: (sin(π) )/(π) ) = 0. So I2=0.

That's not correct, as I know that the secondary maxima exist.

Wait, perhaps the formula is I_n = I_0 [ (sin(nπ) ) / (nπ) ) ]^2, but this only applies for integer n, which would give zero. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just look for the answer.

Wait, from what I know, the first secondary maximum is about 0.203 times the central maximum, the second is about 0.043 times, the third about 0.023 times, etc. So the ratios are approximately 0.203, 0.043, 0.023, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.035, 0.014, 0.007 → 0.035, 0.014, 0.007.

Wait, but if the first secondary is 0.203, then 0.035 is (0.035 / 0.035) = 1, which is larger. So that option doesn't fit.

Option B: 0.030, 0.012, 0.0060 → 0.03, 0.012, 0.006.

0.03, 0.012, 0.006. So 0.03 is about 0.03, 0.012 is about 0.012, 0.006 is 0.006.

Wait, but the expected ratio for the first is 0.203, which is higher than 0.03. So perhaps none of the options are correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the maxima.

Wait, perhaps the secondary maximum comes before the minimum. So the first secondary maximum is before the first minimum. So the intensity of the secondary maxima would be higher than the central maximum.

Wait, that can't be, because the central maximum is the brightest.

Wait, perhaps the first secondary maximum is actually lower than the first minimum.

Wait, maybe the first secondary maximum is lower than the first minimum, but not necessarily higher than the central maximum.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. I think perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options are correct.

The problem involves determining the relative intensities of the secondary maxima in a single-slit diffraction pattern. The intensity of the central maximum is taken as the reference, and the relative intensities of the secondary maxima are calculated based on known approximations.

   - The first ratio (0.050) is approximately 0.203 times the central maximum, which is inconsistent with the known value of 0.203.  
   - The second ratio (0.015) is approximately 0.043 times the central maximum, which is close to the known value.  
   - The third ratio (0.0075) is approximately 0.023 times the central maximum, which is close to the known value.  
   - The first ratio does not align with the expected value of 0.203.

### Conclusion:
The relative intensities of the secondary maxima are approximately 0.203, 0.043, and 0.023 times the central maximum. None of the options provided exactly match these values. However, Option A (0.035, 0.014, 0.0070) is the closest, as the first ratio (0.035) is close to 0.203, while the second and third ratios (0.014 and 0.0070) are close to 0.043 and 0.023, respectively.

ANSWER: A
