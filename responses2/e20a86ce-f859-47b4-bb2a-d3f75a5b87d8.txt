Okay, so I have this question about dalmatians and their color patterns. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I remember that dalmatians are those breed of dog with a kind of fluffy coat. I think they come in various colors, but the question is about their last character—so the last part of their name, which is "Puppy."

Wait, the question says, "When born a Dalmatian puppy is always?" So it's about when the puppy is born, not their current color. I remember that certain breeds have specific color patterns. Dalmatians are a bit tricky because their colors can change over time.

I think some Dalmatians have a more uniform appearance, maybe in a single color, while others have patterns. Oh right, I recall that some Dalmatian puppies have a black and brown pattern. Like, they might have black spots on brown or vice versa. Or perhaps one or both of their coats are black and brown. 

Wait, let me think. I think the typical pattern is a mixture of black and brown. So maybe their last character is something like 'E' or 'H'? Let me look at the options. The options are A to J. 

Looking at the options, E is "Brown with black spots." H is "Black with white spots." Wait, but I remember that dalmatians often have a black and brown pattern, not white and black. So maybe E is the right answer, but I'm a bit confused because I've also heard that dalmatians can have a more uniform appearance, especially if they're young. 

Let me try to recall. Young dalmatians might be all one color, maybe brown, but older ones get more patterns. I think some breeds have a more uniform body, while others have a pattern. The question is about when born, so the initial appearance. So if it's when born, maybe the pattern hasn't formed yet. Or does it form during the time of birth?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the typical pattern of a Dalmatian. I'm a bit uncertain. Another approach is to think about the answer options. Let's see: E is "Brown with black spots." H is "Black with white spots." I think perhaps the correct answer is E or H.

Wait, I think some Dalmatians have a more uniform appearance, so maybe brown and black, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that some Dalmatians have a pattern, but when born, they might be a single color. But the options don't give that. 

Wait, another angle: when a puppy is born, it's a new creature, so it's not yet showing patterns. So perhaps the answer refers to the typical pattern. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the typical color of a Dalmatian, but the wording is about when born.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that a Dalmatian puppy is always brown or black with spots. I think I've heard that some Dalmatians have a pattern, like a black and brown coat, so their last character might be E or H. Let me think again. 

Wait, another thought: some Dalmatians have a more uniform color, while others have a pattern. If it's a Dalmatian puppy, perhaps the answer is E or H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that when a Dalmatian is born, it's often a single color, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is that when born, a Dalmatian puppy is always "Brown with black spots." Or perhaps it's "White with brown spots." I'm a bit stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess here.

Wait, I remember that some Dalmatians have a more uniform appearance, so maybe their last character is H: "Black with white spots." Or perhaps E: "Brown with black spots." Alternatively, some have a black and brown pattern, so maybe E is the answer.

Wait, another approach: I've seen that some Dalmatians have a more uniform color, while others have a pattern. If it's a Dalmatian puppy, perhaps the answer is E or H.

Alternatively, I think that some Dalmatians have a pattern, but I'm not certain. I'm a bit confused, but I think I have to make a choice. Let me try to think of when a Dalmatian is born. The question is about the last character of the answer, so the last letter of the word. Let's see the options:

E: Brown with black spots → ends with 's' → last letter 's'.
H: Black with white spots → ends with 's' → last letter 's'.
Wait, no, the options for the answer choices are letters A to J, each being a single word. The question is about the last character of the answer, which is the last letter of the word in the options.

Wait, no, the question says, "When born a Dalmatian puppy is always?" So the answer options are letters (A to J), each being a single word? Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Grey
B: Brown
C: white with black spots
D: Black with brown spots
E: Brown with black spots
F: white
G: Completely spotted
H: black with white spots
I: White with brown spots
J: Black

Wait, each option is a word. So the answer is one of these words, and the last letter of the word is the last character of the answer. So for example, if the answer is 'E', the last letter is 's'. The question is, when the puppy is born, what's their last character of the answer.

So the options are all possible words, so the correct answer is E, H, or others. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think that Dalmatians can have a more uniform appearance, but perhaps the answer is E: Brown with black spots. Or perhaps H: Black with white spots. Alternatively, I think some have a black and brown pattern. I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the correct answer is E: Brown with black spots.

Alternatively, another approach: I've heard that Dalmatian puppies are often brown and have a black and brown pattern, so perhaps the correct answer is E: Brown with black spots.

The correct answer is E: Brown with black spots. This is because when born, Dalmatian puppies often have a uniform brown coat with a black and brown pattern, which aligns with option E. 

Answer: E
