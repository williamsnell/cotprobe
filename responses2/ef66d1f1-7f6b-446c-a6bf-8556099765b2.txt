Question:

What is meant by income elasticity of demand?

Options:

A: Income elasticity of demand is the change in demand for a good in response to a change in the price level of all other goods.
B: Income elasticity of demand is the degree to which the demand for a good changes in relation to changes in population demographics.
C: Income elasticity of demand is the ratio of the change in the quantity of a good supplied to the change in consumer's income.
D: Income elasticity of demand is the proportion of income spent on a good to the total income.
E: Income elasticity of demand is the measure of how much the quantity of a good demanded fluctuates with changes in the prices of complementary goods.
F: Income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the price of a good divided by the percentage change in a consumer's income.
G: Income elasticity of demand is the measure of a consumer's willingness to buy more as income increases.
H: Income elasticity of demand is the correlation between a consumer's income and the price of a good.
I: Income elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage change in quantity of a good demanded divided by the percentage change in a consumer's income.
J: Income elasticity of demand is the change in the quantity of a good demanded in response to a one percent increase in the market interest rate.

Okay, so I have this question about income elasticity of demand, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that elasticity generally measures how responsive one economic variable is to changes in another. So, in this case, it's about how much the quantity demanded of a good changes in response to changes in income. But wait, there's a catch. I think elasticity can be negative because if income goes up and demand goes down, that's an inverse relationship.

So, the options are A through J. Let me read them again.

Option A: It says it's the change in demand due to a change in the price level of all other goods. Hmm, I don't think that's right because that sounds like price elasticity of demand. Price elasticity is about how much the quantity demanded changes when price changes, but this is about income.

Option B: It mentions changes in population demographics. That doesn't sound right either. Population demographics affect demand based on age, education, etc., but income elasticity is about income.

Option C: Ratio of change in quantity supplied to income change. Wait, that's price elasticity of supply, right? Because it's the change in quantity supplied over price. But income elasticity is about quantity demanded over income, so C is about supply, not demand.

Option D: Proportion of income spent on a good to total income. That's the income share or the proportion of income, but income elasticity is about demand responsiveness, not the composition of income.

Option E: Changes in price of complementary goods. No, that's cross elasticity. Income elasticity is about how much quantity demanded changes with income, not prices of other goods.

Option F: Percentage change in price over income change. Wait, no, that's not what income elasticity is. It's about quantity change over income change. So F is talking about price elasticity.

Option G: Consumer's willingness to buy more as income increases. That's more about the income effect, but I'm not sure if that's the same as elasticity. Because elasticity would measure the responsiveness, not just willingness.

Option H: Correlation between income and price. No, correlation is a broad term. Income elasticity specifically refers to the responsiveness of demand.

Option I: Percentage change in quantity over percentage change in income. That sounds right because that's exactly what elasticity isâ€”percentage change in one variable over another.

Option J: Change in quantity demanded due to a one percent increase in interest rate. That's related to interest rate elasticity, though, not income elasticity.

So, putting it together, the correct definition is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. That's option I.

The correct answer is **I: Income elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage change in quantity of a good demanded divided by the percentage change in a consumer's income.**

**Answer: I**
