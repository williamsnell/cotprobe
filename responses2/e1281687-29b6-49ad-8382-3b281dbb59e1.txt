Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Durbin-Watson statistic and autocorrelation. Hmm, I remember that the Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic is used to test for the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis. Autocorrelation refers to the correlation between a variable and its own previous time points.

Wait, the question is about what the Durbin-Watson statistic being close to zero implies regarding the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. I think the Durbin-Watson test produces a value between 0 and 4. A value around 2 means no autocorrelation. But when the value is close to zero or close to four, that suggests the opposite.

Oh right, the formula for DW is 2(1 - r), where r is the sample autocorrelation. So if DW is close to zero, then (1 - r) would be close to zero, meaning r would be close to 1. Because if DW is near zero, then 2(1 - r) is near zero, so 1 - r ≈ 0 → r ≈1.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the Durbin-Watson test is based on the residuals. The DW statistic is calculated as:

DW = Σ(e_i - e_{i-1})² / Σ e_i²

And this is supposed to be close to 2*(1 - ρ), where ρ is the first-order autocorrelation. So if DW is close to 0, then 2*(1 - ρ) ≈0. That implies 1 - ρ ≈0 → ρ≈1. So the autocorrelation coefficient is near 1.

But wait, how does that translate into the options given? The options are about the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. So if DW is close to zero, the coefficient is near 1. Looking at the options, I'm looking for the option that says the coefficient is close to plus one. Option H is "Exactly plus one." Option J is "Close to plus one."

Wait, but sometimes the DW statistic can be between 0 and 4. If it's exactly 2, then ρ is 0, meaning no autocorrelation. If it's close to 0, that's a very high positive correlation in the residuals, implying strong positive autocorrelation. So the first-order coefficient would be close to +1.

Wait, but the options don't have an "exactly one" option. Let me look again. The options are A through J. Oh, option H is "Exactly plus one", J is "Close to plus one". So if the DW is exactly zero, that would imply the coefficient is exactly one. But if it's close to zero, the coefficient is close to one. So the correct answer would be H, but that's an exact number. Alternatively, if the DW is very low, the coefficient is very close to one. So the answer would be J, which says "Close to plus one".

But wait, another angle: the DW statistic can never be negative. So when the DW is close to zero, that would imply a high positive autocorrelation because the sum of squared differences in consecutive residuals is small compared to the total sum of squares. So that's a lot of positive correlation.

Alternatively, the formula is 2(1 - r). So if DW is zero, 2*(1 - r) = 0 → 1 - r = 0 → r=1. So the autocorrelation coefficient is exactly 1. But that's not an option except for J, which says "Close to plus one". Wait, but J is the only option that's about being close to plus one.

Wait, but option H is "Exactly plus one". So if the DW is exactly zero, then the autocorrelation is exactly one. But in reality, it's very close to one, not exactly. So the correct answer would be J, because the DW being close to zero implies the coefficient is close to one.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If the Durbin-Watson statistic is low (close to zero), that suggests that the residuals are positively correlated. So the first-order autocorrelation is positive and high. So the coefficient is close to +1. So the answer should be J.

But wait, sometimes people might think of the absolute value. Or maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me double-check the Durbin-Watson formula. I recall that the Durbin-Watson test statistic is given by:

DW = 2(1 - r̂₁)

Where r̂₁ is the estimated first-order autocorrelation. So when DW is close to zero, that implies r̂₁ is close to 1. Because 2(1 - r̂₁) ≈0 → r̂₁ ≈1.

So the coefficient is close to +1, so the answer is J. But wait, option H says "Exactly plus one". But in reality, the DW statistic can't be zero unless the coefficient is exactly one. But that's a rare scenario.

Wait, let's think about the possible options. The question asks, if the DW is close to zero, what is the first-order autocorrelation coefficient.

So, if DW is close to zero, then as per the formula, the coefficient is close to 1. So the correct option would be J, because that's the only option that says it's close to plus one. Alternatively, the options are A through J, so option H is 'Exactly plus one', which is correct only in the case where DW is exactly zero, but in most practical cases, the DW is close to zero, which would imply the coefficient is close to one.

So the answer should be J, which is "Close to plus one".

The Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic measures autocorrelation in the residuals of a regression analysis. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{DW} = 2(1 - \rho) \]

where \(\rho\) is the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. If the DW statistic is close to zero, the equation becomes:

\[ \text{DW} \approx 0 \implies 2(1 - \rho) \approx 0 \implies 1 - \rho \approx 0 \implies \rho \approx 1 \]

This implies that the first-order autocorrelation coefficient is close to +1. Among the options provided, this corresponds to **J: Close to plus one**.
