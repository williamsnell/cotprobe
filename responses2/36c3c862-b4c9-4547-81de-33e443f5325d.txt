Okay, so I've got this question about a firm's capital, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says: What is the capital of a firm that has total assets of $240,000, total liabilities of $100,000, and an income of $40,000 for one year. The options are A through J, each with a different number.

Hmm. I remember that in accounting, total assets equal total liabilities plus total equity. So, the formula is Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Or rearranged, Equity = Assets - Liabilities. Oh wait, right, that's the basic accounting equation.

So the firm's total assets are $240,000, and total liabilities are $100,000. So to find equity, which is another way of saying capital, I subtract the liabilities from the assets. Let's do that: 240,000 minus 100,000 equals $140,000. So the capital would be $140,000.

Wait, but the question mentions the income for one year. Does that matter here? I think capital refers to the owner's equity, which is the amount of money they've invested or the net worth. The income (revenue or profit) is part of the business's performance, but the capital is calculated from the balance sheet equation. Oh wait, but sometimes in some contexts, people confuse net worth with something else. However, in the context of a balance sheet, the capital is the same as net worth, which is assets minus liabilities.

So I think the correct answer is D, which is $140,000.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about another angle. The question might be trying to trick me into thinking about net income, but no, the question is about the capital, which is the same as net worth. Alternatively, is the income part of the assets or something else? No, assets are separate from income. So I think the answer is indeed $140,000.

The capital of the firm is determined by the difference between total assets and total liabilities, as per the accounting equation. 

- **Total Assets**: $240,000
- **Total Liabilities**: $100,000

Using the formula **Equity = Assets - Liabilities**, the capital is calculated as:

$240,000 - $100,000 = $140,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: $140,000**.

Answer: D
