Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the unit rate for driving 308 km in 4 hours. Hmm, unit rate usually means I need to find how much distance is covered per hour. Right, so that's distance divided by time. Let me think about the numbers.

So, the distance is 308 km and the time is 4 hours. To find the unit rate, I should divide 308 by 4. Let me do that calculation. 

Wait, 4 times 70 is 280, and 4 times 77 is 308 because 70*4 is 280, 77*4 is 308. Oh wait, that's a coincidence. Let me calculate accurately.

308 divided by 4. So, 4 goes into 30 eight times (since 4*7 is 28, which is less than 30). Wait, no, 4 into 30 is 7 times 4 is 28. Subtract 28 from 30, you get 2. Bring down the 8, making it 28. 4 into 28 is 7. So, 77. So the unit rate is 77 km/h.

Wait, the options are A:76, B:74, C:72, D:70, E:82, F:78, G:75, H:68, I:77, J:80. Oh, so option I is 77 km/h. So the answer should be I. But I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes rounding is needed. But in this case, 308 divided by 4 is exactly 77. So rounding isn't necessary. So I think the correct answer is I, 77 km/h.

The unit rate is calculated by dividing the distance by time: 308 km รท 4 h = 77 km/h. No rounding is needed as it's exact.

Answer: I: 77 km/h

**Answer:** I
