Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it again.

The scenario is a young man suggesting his friend steal a large-screen TV from a neighbor's house. The friend gets angry and decides to get even by arresting him. He drives the young man to the neighbor's house. The young man breaks in while the friend is outside. The friend calls the police, then leaves. Then, when the young man is carrying the TV, the friend is already at the scene waiting, and the police arrive just as the young man is carrying the TV.

The question is about what offense the friend is guilty of in a common law jurisdiction. The options are A through J, with each representing different crimes.

Hmm. Let me break this down. So the friend is trying to get the young man to commit a crime (stealing TV). But the young man is breaking in. So the friend is helping the young man, but the young man is the one who's breaking in.

In common law, criminal liability is usually determined by crimes committed. If the young man breaks in the house, that's a trespass. But the friend is assisting him, which in common law is considered facilitating the crime. However, I remember that accessory to burglary is when someone's presence facilitates the commission of a felony. But in this case, it's a theft, not a felony.

Wait, so the young man is breaking in the house, which is a trespass. The friend is helping him, so does that count as aiding and abetting? Or is it accessory to burglary?

Alternatively, maybe the friend is aiding and abetting the theft because he's assisting, but the theft itself is a separate offense. Wait, wait, no. Because the friend is aiding the young man's crime. So, the friend's actions are facilitating the theft, but the theft is a separate offense.

Wait, but in criminal law, when you help someone commit a crime, you're not automatically adding to the crime's liability. It's more about facilitating. So, in common law, accessory to burglary is about someone's presence facilitating a felony. Here, the theft is a misdemeanor, not a felony. So, the friend's aiding doesn't make the theft criminal unless he's in the position of assistance.

Alternatively, the friend might be considered 'aiding and abetting' because he's assisting the young man's crime. But in common law, 'aiding and abetting' is a separate category. So, the friend's actions in helping would be considered an aiding and abetting offense, but the main offense is the theft.

Wait, but the question is about what the friend is guilty of. If the friend is helping the theft, then in criminal law, the friend's aiding is not criminal. So the main offense would be the theft, which is larceny.

Wait, but let me think again. In common law, the crime of larceny is usually considered a separate offense from trespass. The main element is the unlawful entry into a building and the theft of property. But if someone is helping to commit it, does that mean the main crime is theft, and the friend's actions are aiding?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the elements. The friend is helping the young man break into the house. So, the main thing is that the theft is happening, but the friend is aiding. So, would that count as aiding and abetting, but the theft is still a separate offense?

Wait, no. Because in criminal law, if the person is helping to commit a crime, it's not considered a separate offense. For example, if someone is helping to commit a felony, like larceny, the person isn't automatically charged with larceny. Instead, they're considered to be facilitating the crime. So, the crime of larceny is separate from facilitating it.

So in this case, the friend is aiding and abetting the theft, but the theft itself is a separate offense. So, the friend is not guilty of larceny by aiding, but he's aiding the theft. So the theft remains the main offense.

Wait, but the options include burglary, which is a felony. So, if the friend is aiding and abetting a felony, he's not guilty of the felony. But the theft is a misdemeanor, not a felony. So the main offense is larceny, not burglary.

So the friend is aiding the theft, but the theft itself is a separate larceny. So he's not guilty of either the theft or the felony. So the answer would be no crime, because the theft isn't criminal.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option D is 'No crime.' So, if the friend is helping the theft, which is a misdemeanor, but the theft isn't criminal, then he's not guilty of any crime. So D is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps he's considered to be 'aiding and abetting' a burglary, but since it's theft, that doesn't apply. So, the friend isn't guilty of any crime, so the answer is D.

The friend is helping the young man break into the house, committing a theft, but the theft is a misdemeanor, not a felony. In common law, aiding and abetting a felony does not result in criminal liability for that felony. The theft itself is a separate offense, and the friend's actions do not constitute criminal facilitating or aiding, so the friend is not guilty of any crime. 

Answer: D: No crime.
