Okay, so I've got this problem here about air flowing under certain conditions and I need to find the Mach number. Let's see, the problem gives me the air properties and the flow conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the given data: Air has a specific heat ratio k = 1.4, molecular weight (MW) = 29. The flow velocity is 224 feet per second (fps) and pressure is 14.7 psia. The temperature is 17°C. I need to find the Mach number.

Wait, wait, wait. So I remember that the Mach number is the ratio of the flow velocity to the speed of sound in the medium. So M = v / a, where a is the speed of sound.

But wait, what's the speed of sound? Oh right, the formula is a = sqrt(kRT), but I have to make sure about the units. R is the specific gas constant. For air, R is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), but sometimes it's in different units.

Wait, I think another way is to use the formula a = sqrt(k * R * T) where T is in absolute temperature. Oh wait, but wait, the units may matter here. Let me think. The units for R are in terms of specific gas constant, which is in terms of pressure per unit mass.

Wait, the problem gives the pressure in psia, which is pressure. So maybe I should convert that to the appropriate units for R. So, R for air is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). So T is given in °C, which is 17 + 273.15 = 290.15 °R.

So let's compute a. Let's calculate a:

a = sqrt(k * R * T)
k is 1.4, R is 1716, T is 290.15.

So, 1.4 * 1716 = 2402.4. Then multiply by 290.15: 2402.4 * 290.15 ≈ Let me compute that.

Wait, 2400 * 290 is about 696,000, but more accurately, 2402.4 * 290.15. Let me compute that step by step.

Wait, 2402.4 * 290 = 2402.4 * 200 = 480,480; 2402.4 * 90 = 216,216. So 480,480 + 216,216 = 696,696. Then 2402.4 * 0.15 = 360.36. So total is 696,696 + 360.36 = 697,056.36.

So a squared is 697,056.36, so a is sqrt(697,056.36). Let me approximate that. Because 835^2 is 697,225, which is a bit more. Wait 835^2 = (800 + 35)^2 = 800² + 2*800*35 + 35² = 640,000 + 56,000 + 1,225 = 640,000 +56,000 is 696,000, plus 1,225 is 697,225. Oh, so 835^2 is 697,225. Our value is 697,056.36, which is a little less. So sqrt(697,056.36) is about 835 minus a bit. Let's say approximately 834.8 or something. So the speed of sound 'a' is approximately 835 ft/s.

Wait, but the flow velocity is 224 ft/s. So M = 224 / 835 ≈ 0.267, about 0.27. But wait, the options don't have 0.27. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A:0.3, B:0.4, C:1.2, D:0.1, E:0.8, F:0.2, G:0.5, H:1.0, I:0.6, J:0.7.

So 0.27 would be closest to 0.3. So option A is 0.3. But wait, wait. Another thought: maybe I should use the speed of sound formula with the different units.

Wait, another approach. The speed of sound formula is a = sqrt( (k P) / rho ), where P is pressure and rho is density. But I don't know rho. Alternatively, using the formula a = sqrt(k R T), which I did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check the calculation of a. Let me recalculate the a value.

Compute k*R*T:

k = 1.4

R = 1716 ft·lbm·R^-1·lbf.

T = 17 + 273.15 = 290.15 R.

So 1.4 * 1716 = 2402.4.

2402.4 * 290.15 = let me compute this accurately.

Alternative way: 2402.4 × 290.15 = ?

Let me compute 2402.4 × 290 = ?

2402.4 * 200 = 480,480.

2402.4 * 90 = 216,216.

So 480,480 + 216,216 = 696,696.

Now 2402.4 × 0.15 = 360.36.

So total is 696,696 + 360.36 = 697,056.36.

So a^2 = 697,056.36 → a = sqrt(697,056.36) ≈ 835 ft/s.

So M = 224 / 835 ≈ 0.267. So around 0.27. The options are A:0.3, which is about 0.3, and the next option is 0.2 (F). So the closest is A:0.3.

Wait, but another point: the air could be either subsonic or supersonic. If Mach number is less than 1, it's subsonic. If it's more than 1, it's supersonic.

So in this case, M is approximately 0.267, which is less than 1. So the flow is subsonic.

Wait, but wait, another thing: the static pressure and temperature. Because sometimes the speed of sound depends on the stagnation conditions or dynamic conditions. I'm using the formula for static conditions, because the speed of sound is based on static properties.

So I think the approach is correct. So the answer should be approximately 0.27, which rounds to 0.3, so option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Another formula for Mach number is M = sqrt( (P / P0) * (T / To) ), where P0 is the reference pressure, To is the reference temperature. But in this case, the given pressure is 14.7 psia, which is the standard atmospheric pressure (since 14.7 psia at 14°C is standard pressure). Wait, no, 14.7 psia is the standard pressure (14.7 psia = 14.7 psig, which is 14.7 psia = 14.7 psig = 14.7 psia - 14.7 psig is the gauge, but 14.7 psia is absolute pressure. So, P = 14.7 psia, which is 14.7 psia. To find the P0, we need to know the reference pressure for the given temperature. Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the ideal gas law, assuming that the pressure and temperature given are the static conditions. So maybe the approach I took earlier is correct.

Wait, another way to compute speed of sound is a = sqrt( (k P ) / (rho) ). But rho is the density. Using the ideal gas law, rho = P/(R T). So substituting:

a = sqrt( (k P ) / ( P/(R T) ) ) ) = sqrt( k R T ). Which brings me back to the same calculation. So that's correct.

So no, the approach is correct, so M is about 0.267, which is approximately 0.3.

Looking at the options, A is 0.3. So the answer should be A.

To determine the Mach number for the air flow, we use the formula:

\[
M = \frac{v}{a}
\]

where \(v\) is the flow velocity and \(a\) is the speed of sound. The speed of sound in air is calculated using the formula:

\[
a = \sqrt{kRT}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperature to Rankine
The given temperature is \(T = 17^\circ \text{C}\). To convert to Rankine:
\[
T = 17 + 273.15 = 290.15 \, \text{R}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the speed of sound
The specific heat ratio \(k = 1.4\) and the specific gas constant for air \(R = 1716 \, \text{ft·lbf/(lbm·R)}\). Substituting these values:
\[
a = \sqrt{kRT} = \sqrt{1.4 \cdot 1716 \cdot 290.15}
\]

First, calculate \(1.4 \cdot 1716 = 2402.4\). Then, multiply by \(290.15\):
\[
2402.4 \cdot 290.15 = 697,056.36
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
a = \sqrt{697,056.36} \approx 835 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Mach number
The flow velocity is \(v = 224 \, \text{ft/s}\). Substituting into the Mach number formula:
\[
M = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{224}{835} \approx 0.267
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The Mach number is approximately \(0.27\), which is less than \(1\). This indicates that the flow is subsonic. Among the given options, the closest value to \(0.27\) is \(0.3\).

### Final Answer:
The Mach number at which the flow occurs is approximately \(0.3\), corresponding to option A.
