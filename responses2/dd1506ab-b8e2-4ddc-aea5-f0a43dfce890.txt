Okay, so I have this question about Word2Vec parameters and activation functions. Let me think through it step by step.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says that Word2Vec parameters were not initialized using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Wait, I remember that Word2Vec uses a neural network approach. The original method by Mikolov et al. uses a different kind of network. Oh right, I think the original Word2Vec used a two-layer neural network, not RBM. RBMs are for unsupervised learning and are used in other models like RBM-based autoencoders. So statement 1 is probably false because Word2Vec does use RBMs, so the parameters were initialized with RBMs.

Statement 2 says the tanh function is a nonlinear activation function. I'm pretty sure tanh is a common activation function. It's nonlinear because it's not a linear function. The tanh function maps inputs between -1 and 1, which is different from, say, a sigmoid that maps to 0 and 1. So statement 2 is true.

Now looking at the options. The options are combinations of True/False for these two statements. Let's see:

Option D says both are true. That would be correct because Statement 1 is false (as Word2Vec does use RBMs) and Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but what about the first statement? If the parameters were initialized with RBMs, then the statement is false. So the first part is false, the second is true. So the answer is D: True, True. Or wait no, the options are the choices for the statements.

Wait, the options are the answer choices for the statements. The first part is Statement 1's truth value, the second is Statement 2's. So the first option is about the first statement true or false, and the second about the second.

So the options are:

A: True, False
B: False, False
C: False, True
D: True, True

Wait, no. The options are given as the two statements' truth values. So the question is, which combination is correct.

Statement 1: False (because Word2Vec uses RBMs)
Statement 2: True (tanh is nonlinear)

So the correct option should be the one where the first is false, the second is true. Looking at the options:

Option C: False, True. So the answer is C.

The first statement is false because Word2Vec parameters were initialized using RBMs. The second statement is true as tanh is a nonlinear activation function. 

Answer: C: False, True
