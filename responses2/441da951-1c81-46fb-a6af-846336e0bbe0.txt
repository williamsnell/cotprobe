Okay, so I've got this question about unemployment types, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The question says that Theo loses his job at the public swimming pool when the pool closes for the winter. The options are various types of unemployment. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what each term means.

First, I'll list out the options:

A: natural unemployment
B: underemployment
C: discouraged worker
D: structural unemployment
E: jobless recovery
F: cyclical unemployment
G: seasonal unemployment
H: frictional unemployment
I: long-term unemployment
J: involuntary unemployment

The scenario is Theo losing his job because his employer, the swimming pool, closes for the winter. So, he's voluntarily leaving his job. Now, I need to determine what unemployment type this is.

Natural unemployment is when the economy is doing well and people can't find new jobs because the economy has ample workers and demand is high. So, when the economy is strong, people don't have to work elsewhere. But Theo's situation is different because his job was at a closed pool, so it's not natural. So A is probably not correct.

Underemployment refers to people who are employed but aren't fully utilized, making them "unhappy." The question doesn't mention if he's underpaid or not, but it's more about his being失业 rather than underpaid. So B could be possible.

Theo was voluntarily leaving his job, which is a sign of involuntary unemployment. involuntary unemployment is when people choose not to work because they're out of the job market. So J is a possibility.

Now, structural unemployment is when there's a mismatch between the job and the economy. For example, if a factory lays off workers because the economy is bad. But in this case, the pool closes, which is a specific event that might not be related to the structural issues. So I don't think it's structural.

Discouraged worker is someone who has stopped looking for work but isn't part of the labor force. Theo is actively looking for a new job, so he's not a discouraged worker. So C is not correct.

Structural unemployment would require the economy to change, like if the industry is growing or if there are technological changes. In Theo's case, the pool closing is a specific event, not an economic shift. So D is probably not the right answer.

Jobless recovery (E) refers to economic recovery after a downturn, but the question is about unemployment, not economic recovery. So E is not it.

Seasonal unemployment (G) is when businesses have to lay off workers during off-peak seasons, like in the summer. The winter closing might be seasonal, but it's more likely the closure is due to the pool's inability to handle more people. So G is not the case here.

Frictional unemployment (H) is when people are temporarily out of work because of changes in the labor market, like people leaving jobs or moving. For example, people walking from their job to a new one. Theo is leaving his job, so H could be a possibility. But wait, I'm not sure if it's considered part of involuntary unemployment. I think H is a type of frictional unemployment, but the question is about his example, which is the pool closing.

Long-term unemployment (I) would involve people who have had to quit jobs for a long time, like those searching for jobs after the economy starts to recover. Theo's situation seems more about an immediate decision to leave, not a long-term search. So I might not be correct.

Putting it all together, Theo is voluntarily leaving his job because his employer can't find him. That's involuntary unemployment. He's not underemployment (B) because underemployment is about being underpaid, which the question doesn't indicate. His situation is more about his choice, not being underpaid.

So the correct answer should be J: involuntary unemployment.
</think>

Theo's situation involves him voluntarily leaving his job at a closed swimming pool, which is a clear example of involuntary unemployment. This occurs when an individual chooses not to work because there are no suitable jobs available, often due to economic factors or personal reasons. Other options like structural, cyclical, or seasonal unemployment are not applicable here. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: involuntary unemployment.**

Answer: J
