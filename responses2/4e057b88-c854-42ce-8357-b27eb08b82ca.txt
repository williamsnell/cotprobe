Question:

A 46-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, comes to the office because of a 2-week history of black discharge from her right nipple. The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2 months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity, palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, noted at her most recent annual examination. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. BMI is 30 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses. There is scant, black discharge from the right nipple. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: Core needle biopsy of the right breast
B: Ductography
C: Start on antifungal treatment
D: Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue
E: MRI of the right breast
F: Fine needle aspiration of the right nipple discharge
G: Mammography of the left breast
H: Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast
I: Histopathological study of the discharge
J: Repeat mammography

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this multiple-choice question about a patient's breast exam. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The patient is a 46-year-old woman with gravida 1 and para 1, meaning she's a high-risk woman since her FGA is low (around 5.8ish). She had a 2-week history of black discharge from her right nipple. She did mammography and ultrasonography two months ago for increased glandularity, and now at her annual exam, those findings were recommended for follow-up in 6 months.

The studies showed likely benign findings, so she's being considered for follow-up. Her medical history is unremarkable, and she doesn't take any medications. Her BMI is 30 kg/mÂ², which for a woman is a bit on the higher side, but she's in the high-risk category.

P palpation of the right breast was in the upper outer quadrant, with glandularity noted. No other masses. She has scant, black discharge from the nipple. The options include various diagnostic tests.

Let me think about the possible diagnoses here. Glandular tissue is usually a sign of benign breast cancer, especially if it's in the upper outer quadrant. But the discharge is black and scant. Black discharge is usually indicative of endometriosis, which can be a sign of cancer or other endocrine conditions. So, the primary concern is whether the discharge is benign or malignant.

The options are:

A: Core needle biopsy of the right breast
B: Ductography
C: Start on antifungal treatment
D: Excision of the glandular tissue
E: MRI
F: Fine needle aspiration of the nipple discharge
G: Mammography of the left breast
H: Repeat ultrasonography
I: Histopathological study of the discharge
J: Repeat mammography

Let's break them down.

Option F: Fine needle aspiration of the nipple discharge. This is a possible test. Since the discharge is scant and black, aFNAs might be useful, especially if it's suspicious. However, if the discharge is benign, maybe it's fine to exclude it and proceed to biopsy.

Option D: Excision of the gland tissue. If the discharge is suspicious, especially if it's in a suspicious quadrant, and the ultrasound shows no masses, then excision might be considered. It's a surgical option, but if the patient is a high-risk woman, maybe biopsy is more appropriate to confirm.

Option I: Histopathological study of the discharge. That makes sense because if the discharge is suspicious, a biopsy could confirm it. However, if the discharge is benign, this might not be necessary.

Option A: Core needle biopsy. That's a gold standard for evaluating malignancy. But if the discharge is suspicious, maybe a biopsy is warranted.

Option F: FNAs are often used in cases where a biopsy is difficult or when the discharge is suspicious. For example, in endometriosis, FNAs can help confirm the presence of cancer.

Option D: Excision biopsy is more surgical and might be done when imaging suggests a suspicious mass or when the volume is too small for a biopsy.

Option E: MRI. MRI can sometimes detect malignancy, but if the woman's ultrasound shows no masses and the breast is palpated as non-cancerous, MRI might not provide much info. It could show a suspicious lump but might not confirm malignancy.

Option G: Mammography of the left breast. Since the study is on the right breast, it's possible that the left breast might be normal. But if the patient has high-risk factors, maybe the left breast is suspicious.

Option J: Repeat mammography. That's a follow-up, but maybe if the discharge is suspicious, a biopsy is more appropriate.

Option H: Repeat ultrasonography. The initial ultrasound showed likely benign findings, so maybe follow-up isn't needed. But the patient has high risk, so maybe the mammogram is still important.

So, putting it together, the patient has a suspicious discharge, which suggests possibly endometriosis. The ultrasound was for increased glandularity, but since it's high-risk, maybe the focus is on the discharge.

So, what's the next step? If the discharge is suspicious, the next step would be to biopsy. Since the patient's other findings (glandularity) suggest malignancy, and the discharge is black and scant, a biopsy is the next logical step.

Looking at the options, D is Excision biopsy of the glandular tissue. Alternatively, F is FNAs, which could be used if the discharge is suspicious.

But in a high-risk patient, if the ultrasound is negative, and the patient has a suspicious mass, a biopsy is indicated. So, whether F or D is the next step.

Wait, the patient's ultrasound showed likely benign findings. So if the ultrasound is not showing any suspicious masses, but the patient has high-risk factors, then the next steps would be to further evaluate for malignancy.

In that case, the next step would be to perform a biopsy or aFNAs.

But F is a FNAs, which is a form of biopsy. However, in high-risk patients, FNAs can help confirm malignancy, especially if the patient has a suspicious mass.

So, the best next step is probably either D or F.

Wait, I've read that in some cases, especially with high-risk patients, FNAs can be used as a diagnostic tool. They can help confirm a suspicious mass.

In this scenario, the patient has a suspicious discharge, so maybe a FNAs would be done.

But another thought: Excision biopsy (D) may be more definitive, especially if the mass is in a suspicious area. However, if the mass is too small or inconclusive, a FNAs might be used.

Another point: Fine needle aspiration is used when the mass is too small or if the tissue is not palpable. The patient's ultrasound showed likely benign findings, but the discharge is black and scant, which is suggestive of malignancy.

So, if the patient's mass is suspicious, a biopsy is better. So, either D or F.

Alternatively, if the mass is in a high-risk area and the patient's other findings are suggestive, the next step might be a biopsy.

Alternatively, the woman's ultrasound showed likely benign findings. So, the next step might be to do a biopsy. So, in that case, either D or F.

But the options given are D, F, I, etc.

Option D is Excision biopsy of the glandular tissue. Option F is FNAs.

Given that, in this scenario, if the patient has a suspicious mass, the next step is to perform a biopsy.

So the next step is either D or F.

Wait, but in some cases, for endometriosis, which is a form of endometriosis, FNAs can be useful. So, if the discharge is black and in a suspicious area, a FNAs can help confirm malignancy.

But in this case, since the patient has high risk and her ultrasound is likely benign, but the discharge is suspicious, perhaps a biopsy is the way to go.

Wait, but if the discharge is in the upper outer quadrant, which is usually associated with benign breast cancer in high-risk women, then maybe the next step is to biopsy.

Alternatively, maybe aFNAs can be done to confirm. So, which of these options is more appropriate.

Option D: Excision biopsy of the glandular tissue. This would be a surgical biopsy, which is definitive. Option F: FNAs, which is a diagnostic tool.

Given that, if the patient has a suspicious mass, a biopsy is the gold standard, but if the mass is too small or inconclusive, a FNAs might be done.

In this case, the patient's ultrasound showed likely benign findings. So, perhaps the next step is a biopsy.

Alternatively, some might suggest that since the patient has high risk factors and the discharge is suspicious, a biopsy is needed.

So, the next step would be to do a biopsy. So, between D and F, which is better.

I think that in such cases, especially with high-risk patients, a biopsy is recommended. So, D: Excision biopsy.

Wait, but another angle: the options include Option I: Histopathological study of the discharge. So, if the discharge is suspicious, a biopsy would be the way to confirm, but if it's benign, then histopathology is not needed.

So, if the patient's discharge is suspicious, the next step is to biopsy.

So, in this scenario, the patient's findings suggest a suspicious mass, so the next step would be to biopsy.

Therefore, the correct next step is D: Excision biopsy of the glandular tissue.
</think>

The patient is a 46-year-old high-risk woman with a suspicious black discharge from her right nipple and a suspicious mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. The ultrasound showed likely benign findings, but the discharge is suggestive of malignancy. Given the high-risk status and the suspicion of endometriosis, the next step is to confirm the presence of malignancy.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Core needle biopsy of the right breast**  
  This is a gold standard for diagnosing malignancy but isèant and may not be feasible in this patient due to the small volume of the lumen.

- **B: Ductography**  
  This is not relevant in this context, as there is no obvious evidence of a ductal mass.

- **C: Start on antifungal treatment**  
  Antifungal treatment is not indicated at this stage, as the discharge is suspicious.

- **D: Excision biopsy of the glandular tissue**  
  This is a definitive diagnostic tool, especially in high-risk patients. It would confirm malignancy if the mass is in the upper outer quadrant.

- **E: MRI**  
  MRI could confirm malignancy but is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

- **F: Fine needle aspiration of the right nipple discharge**  
  FNAs can help confirm malignancy, especially in high-risk patients with suspicious masses.

- **G: Mammography of the left breast**  
  While ultrasound showed likely benign findings, the left breast may still be suspicious due to the patient's high-risk factors.

- **H: Repeat ultrasonography**  
  Ultrasound is already recommended and shows likely benign findings, so this is not necessary.

- **I: Histopathological study of the discharge**  
  If the discharge is suspicious, a biopsy would be required. However, if it is benign, this step is not needed.

- **J: Repeat mammography**  
  This is a follow-up and may not be the next step if a biopsy is indicated.

### Conclusion:
The next step is to biopsy the suspicious mass, likely the glandular tissue in the upper outer quadrant. This is the most appropriate and definitive diagnostic method in this case.
