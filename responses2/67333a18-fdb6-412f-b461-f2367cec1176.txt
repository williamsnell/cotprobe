Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read it again: A penny is to be tossed 3 times. What's the probability there will be 2 heads and 1 tail? The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I think this involves probability basics. I remember that when dealing with independent events like tossing a coin multiple times, each toss is an independent trial. Since a penny has two sides, heads (H) or tails (T), each toss has a 50% chance for each outcome.

The question is about getting exactly 2 heads and 1 tail in 3 tosses. So, I'm looking for all possible sequences where this happens. Let me think about how to calculate that.

First, I think the total number of possible outcomes when tossing a penny 3 times is 2^3, which is 8. Because each toss has 2 possibilities, and there are 3 tosses, so 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. Let me list them to make sure: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT. Yep, that's 8.

Now, how many of these have exactly 2 heads and 1 tail? Let me go through each possibility:

1. HHH: That's all heads, so 3 heads. Not what we want.
2. HHT: 2 heads, 1 tail. That's good.
3. HTH: Same as HHT, 2 heads, 1 tail.
4. HTT: 1 head, 2 tails. Not what we want.
5. THH: 2 heads, 1 tail. Good.
6. THT: 1 head, 2 tails. Not what we want.
7. TTH: 1 head, 2 tails. Not what we want.
8. TTT: All tails. Not our case.

So, the good ones are HHT, HTH, and THH. That's 3 outcomes. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

So, the probability is the number of favorable divided by total number of possible outcomes. That's 3/8.

Looking at the options, option H is 3/8. So, that should be the correct answer.

The probability of getting exactly 2 heads and 1 tail in 3 tosses is calculated as follows:

1. Total possible outcomes: 2^3 = 8 (H, T, HT, TH, HH, HTH, THT, TTH).

2. Favorable outcomes (2H, 1T): There are 3 such outcomes (HHT, HTH, THH).

3. Probability: 3/8.

Looking at the options, the correct choice is:

**H: 3/8**

Answer: H
