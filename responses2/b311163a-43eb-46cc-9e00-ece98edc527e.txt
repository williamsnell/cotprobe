Okay, I'm trying to figure out the number of parameters needed for a standard form, unrestricted, trivariate VAR(4) model. Hmm, the question says to ignore intercepts, so maybe the intercepts aren't counted as parameters. Let me think about VAR models in general.

A VAR(p) model has each variable as a vector autoregressive process of order p. For trivariate, that means three variables: let's call them Y1, Y2, Y3. Each variable is expressed as a linear combination of their own lags and the lags of the other variables.

Wait, but in a standard form, I think each equation is expressed as Y_i(t) = A_i0 + A_i1*Y1(t-1) + ... + A_i4*Y1(t-4), and similarly for Y2 and Y3. Oh wait, but the question says to ignore intercepts, so A_i0 terms are not counted. So each equation would have 4 parameters for the lagged coefficients.

Each equation has 4 parameters (for lags 1 to 4). Since there are three variables, the total number of equations would be 3 variables each contributing 4 parameters? Wait no, wait. Wait, each equation is per variable. So each variable's equation has 4 parameters. So for the first variable Y1, it's 4 parameters. Same for Y2 and Y3. So 4 * 3 = 12 parameters. But wait, maybe in the unrestricted model, each equation's intercept is included, but the question says to ignore them. So intercepts are not counted. So that's 12 parameters.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, no, in the unrestricted model, intercepts are allowed. Oh, but the question says to ignore the intercepts. So we don't count intercepts. But the number of parameters per equation is 4 for each lagged variable. So 4 parameters per variable equation. So for three variables, 4 * 3 = 12. So the total is 12?

Wait, but wait. Another way to think: each equation is a vector. For a trivariate system, each variable has a separate equation. So for each equation (each variable), the number of parameters is the number of lag coefficients. For a VAR(4), each variable has 4 lag coefficients. So per equation, 4 parameters. Three variables, so 4 * 3 = 12. So the total is 12. Looking at the options, option D is 12.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that for a trivariate system, each equation has 4 parameters (since each variable's equation includes 4 lagged variables). But wait, no, each equation's parameters are 4 for each variable. Wait no, each variable's equation has its own 4 parameters. So the total is 4 * 3 = 12. So the answer is D:12.

The number of parameters to be estimated in a standard form, unrestricted, trivariate VAR(4) model, ignoring intercepts, is calculated as follows:

- A trivariate VAR(4) model involves three variables, each expressed as a vector autoregressive process of order 4.
- Each equation for a variable has 4 parameters corresponding to the lagged coefficients (for lags 1 to 4).
- Since there are three variables, the total number of parameters is \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \).

Thus, the total number of parameters is **12**.
