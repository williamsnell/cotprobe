Okay, so I have this question about McDonaldization of Society and which aspect of it is excepted. Let me think through this.

First, I need to understand what McDonaldization refers to. From what I remember, McDonaldization is the process by which modern industries, especially in the US, moved from traditional industries to modern, more efficient, and technology-driven ones. This shift includes things like automation, technology, and more standardized processes.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT an aspect of McDonaldization. Let's look at each option.

Option A: The extensive use of technology in everyday life. That makes sense because a lot of modern life relies on technology, so this is definitely part of McDonaldization. So, this is not the correct answer.

Option B: Rationalization of decisions into cost/benefit analysis structures and away from traditional modes of thinking. This sounds like they’re moving towards more efficient decision-making, which aligns with modernization. Definitely part of McDonaldization. So not the answer.

Option C: Focus on efficiency and predictability. This is similar to B but more general. It implies that there's a structured approach, which is part of what McDonaldization does. So, not the exception.

Option D: Intense effort on achieving sameness across diverse markets. This is about consistency, which is part of modernizing. For example, companies standardizing products to meet global standards. So, part of it, not the answer.

Option E: Increased emphasis on quantity over quality. Wait, this seems counterintuitive. I thought that with technology, companies might focus more on quality. But perhaps in the context of McDonaldization, they're looking for more quantity. Like, perhaps they are producing more to increase supply, which might require more efficient production processes. Alternatively, maybe this refers to mass production, which is part of McDonaldization. So, maybe it's an aspect, not the exception.

Option F: Prioritization of profit over societal well-being. That's a big issue. Traditional McDonaldization was driven by profit, but in reality, the focus has shifted to better welfare. So this is NOT an aspect of McDonaldization. Hmm, this could be the answer.

Option G: Bureaucratic organization that formalizes division of labor and impersonal structures. Bureaucracy is part of the traditional system, which was replaced by modernized systems. So this is part of McDonaldization, so not the exception.

Option H: Standardization of societal norms and practices. Standardization is part of making things more efficient and consistent, so yes, part of McDonaldization.

Option I: Shift from individual craftsmanship to mass production. Definitely part of McDonaldization. For example, robotics and mass production are part of modernization.

Option J: Dissolution of hierarchical modes of authority into collaborative team-based decision protocols. This sounds a lot like the shift from Bureaucracy to a more collaborative system. It's part of modernization, so not the exception.

So the question is, which is the exception. The options that are part of McDonaldization are A, B, C, D, G, H, I, J. Only F is not part of it. F talks about profit over well-being, which is the opposite of McDonaldization's focus.

The question asks which aspect is NOT part of McDonaldization. Analysis of each option:

- **A**: Uses technology—yes, part of McDonaldization.
- **B**: Rationalizes decisions using cost/benefit analysis—yes, part of modernization.
- **C**: Focuses on efficiency and predictability—yes, part of modernization.
- **D**: Achieves sameness across markets—yes, part of efficiency.
- **E**: Emphasizes quantity over quality—questionable, but could be part of modernization.
- **F**: Prioritizes profit over well-being—this shifts towards social well-being, not McDonaldization.
- **G**: Bureaucracy formalized—part of traditional system, not modernization.
- **H**: Standardizes norms—yes, part of efficiency.
- **I**: Shifts from craftsmanship to mass production—yes.
- **J**: Collaborative team decision-making—yes.

The answer is **F**: Increased emphasis on quantity over profit, shifting towards societal well-being. 

Answer: F
