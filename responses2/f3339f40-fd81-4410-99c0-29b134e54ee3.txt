Okay, so I have this question about personnel selection and predictive validity. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options has the highest predictive validity in industry. Predictive validity refers to how well a selection tool can predict an employee's success in a job. So, we're looking for a tool that accurately predicts job performance.

Looking at the options:

A: Projective technique - I'm not familiar with this one. Projective tests are more about personality traits, maybe like the Miller Analogies Test. They assess how someone thinks and functions in social situations. Not sure if that's about predicting job performance.

B: Skills test - This sounds like a good option. If a test assesses specific skills required for the job, it directly measures whether the candidate has the necessary skills. Predictive validity here would be how well those skills translate to job success.

C: Reference check - This is more about checking if the candidate has the right background or references. It's about eligibility, not necessarily predicting job performance.

D: Job sample test - This evaluates the candidate's ability to perform tasks similar to what's required in the job. It's about task performance, which is part of predictive validity because it tests the candidate's ability to do the job effectively.

E: Objective personality inventory - This measures personality traits objectively. While personality is important, predictive validity is about job performance, not personality itself. So maybe not the best choice.

F: Self-assessment survey - This checks how well the candidate thinks they can perform. It's more about self-evaluation than actual job performance.

G: Group interview - This is a form of interview but in a group setting. It can assess group dynamics, communication skills, etc. Not sure about predictive validity in this context.

H: Biographical inventory - This looks at a candidate's background, education, etc. It's more about understanding their background rather than predicting job performance.

I: Interview by the personnel manager - This is a structured interview with a manager. It can assess performance, skills, and decision-making under management. It's a form of job performance assessment, so high predictive validity.

J: Not listed here, but options were up to I. So the possible highest options are B, D, I.

Now, between B and D, both are specific skills and task performance. But which is better for predictive validity? A skills test (B) directly assesses the candidate's ability to perform the required tasks. It evaluates whether they have the necessary skills, which is a strong indicator of their suitability for the job.

A job sample test (D) also measures task performance but might have a different focus. It tests what the candidate can do in a job, whereas a skills test measures the skills required for that job.

An interview (I) is a bit more indirect. It can be structured to assess performance and specific skills. However, it might not capture all the aspects as directly as a skills test or job sample test.

So, B and I are both possible. But I'm not sure if an interview is as reliable as a skills test for predictive validity because it's more about the candidate's ability to perform the tasks under pressure. A skills test would assess the specific skills one has, which is more direct.

Between B and I, I think a skills test (B) is better for predictive validity because it directly tests the skills required for the job. It's more about the candidate's ability to handle the job rather than being an interviewee who might have strong background but poor performance.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes group interviews can assess a lot, including background. But group interviews might not be as reliable as a skills test because they might not capture the same level of performance as a direct task assessment.

So, putting it together, the best option is B: A skills test.

The highest predictive validity in personnel selection comes from a skills test, which directly assesses the candidate's ability to perform the required tasks for the job. This makes it a strong indicator of job performance and suitability.

Answer: B
