Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about circuits and power. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is about an ideal battery with a constant voltage V. It supplies current to a circuit with total resistance R. Then, they double R, and the question is what happens to the total power dissipated by the circuit. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember something about power in circuits. Oh right, power is related to current and resistance. Oh yeah, the formula P = V²/R comes to mind. Or wait, another formula is P = I² R, which might be useful if I need to switch between V and I. Oh, and there's also P = V I, but that's when you have a current flowing through a voltage.

But wait, in this case, the battery has a fixed voltage V. So the voltage across the circuit doesn't change, right? Because it's an ideal battery, so V remains constant. So when the resistance R changes, the current must change because it's V over R. So I = V/R.

So if R doubles, the current I becomes V/(2R), which is half the original current. But wait, power is I squared times R. Let me think. Let's plug in the numbers.

Original power: P = (V/R)² * R = V²/R.

When R is doubled, new R is 2R. So new power is (V/(2R))² * (2R) = (V²/(4 R²)) * 2 R = V²/(2 R).

So the new power is V²/(2 R), and the original was V²/R. So the new power is half of the original. So the power halves.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, using P = I² R. Original I is V/R, so I squared is V²/R². Multiply by R gives V²/R, which matches the earlier calculation. When R is doubled, I becomes V/(2R), so I squared is V²/(4 R²). Multiply by R gives V²/(4 R). So yes, it's half the original.

Wait, so the power is half. So the power after doubling R is half the original. So the power would decrease by a factor of 2. Looking at the options, option E says it will double. No, wait, the new power is half, so it's (1/2) of the original. So it's a factor of 1/2, so it's a decrease by a factor of 2, which would mean the power is half. So the power is halved.

Looking at the options: E says 'double' which is opposite. Another option is D: halved. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait, maybe I got the direction wrong. The question is asking what happens when R is doubled. So the power goes down by half. So the power is halved, so it's a factor of 1/2. So the power is 50% of before. So the power is reduced by a factor of 2, meaning it's half. So the answer would be D: it will be halved.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: The power formula when the voltage is fixed is P = V²/R. So when R is doubled, P becomes V²/(2 R), which is P_original / 2. So yes, power is halved, so it's half as much. So the power is reduced by a factor of 2. So option D.

To determine how the total power dissipated by the circuit changes when the resistance \( R \) is doubled, we start by recalling the power formula for a circuit with a constant voltage \( V \). The power \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \frac{V^2}{R}
\]

When the resistance \( R \) is doubled, the new resistance becomes \( 2R \). Substituting this into the power formula:

\[
P_{\text{new}} = \frac{V^2}{2R}
\]

Comparing this to the original power \( P_{\text{original}} = \frac{V^2}{R} \), we see that the new power is half of the original power:

\[
P_{\text{new}} = \frac{P_{\text{original}}}{2}
\]

This means the total power dissipated by the circuit is reduced by a factor of 2. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A, B, C, F, G, H, J**: These options describe changes other than halving the power.
- **D**: This correctly states that the power is halved.
- **E**: Incorrect, as it suggests the power doubles, which is the opposite of what happens.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: D**
