Okay, so I've got this math problem here about inverse functions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that f(x) is an invertible function, and they give me two specific values: f(2) equals 4, and f inverse of 2 is also 4. Wait, that's interesting. So f(2) is 4, which means that f inverse of 4 should be 2 because inverse functions switch the inputs and outputs. Oh right, so if f(a) = b, then f inverse of b = a.

The question is asking for f(f(2)). I know that f(2) is 4, so that part is straightforward. So f(f(2)) is f(4). But wait, how do I find f(4) here? The problem doesn't directly provide that. Instead, it gives f inverse of 2 as 4. Let's think about that.

Since f inverse of 2 is 4, that means that f(4) must be 2. Because the inverse function essentially reverses the operation. So if f inverse of 2 is 4, then applying f to 4 gives me 2. So f(4) = 2.

Putting this together, f(f(2)) would be f(4), which we just found out is 2. So the answer should be 2, which is option I.

Wait a second, let me double-check. So f(2) is 4, so f inverse of 4 is 2. Then, f inverse of 2 is 4. So f(4) is 2. So when I compute f(f(2)), which is f(4), it's 2. Yep, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option I: 2.

The value of \( f(f(2)) \) is found by first noting that \( f(2) = 4 \). Then, since \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), it follows that \( f(4) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2 \).

Answer: I: 2
