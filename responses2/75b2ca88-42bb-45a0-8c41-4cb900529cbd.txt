Okay, so I've got this question here about economics, specifically money supply and velocity. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says GNP is $2,000 billion, which I know is the same as $2000 billion because GNP stands for Gross National Product. The velocity of money is given as 4. I need to find the money supply from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember there's an equation that relates these concepts. Oh right, the quantity theory of money. The formula is something like M * V = P * Y, but wait, sometimes it's written as M * V = total money in circulation. Or maybe it's M multiplied by V equals the nominal GDP. Oh yeah, the equation is M × V = P × Y, but since I don't have P or Y here, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, the question is about money supply, which I think is M. Velocity of money, V, is given as 4. So if I rearrange the equation, M would be (GDP) divided by V. Or wait, wait, let me think. The formula is M times V equals the total value of all transactions, which is the nominal GDP. But in this case, perhaps the GDP is just the GNP, which is $2,000 billion.

So M = GDP / V. So that's 2000 billion divided by 4. Let's do the math: 2000 /4 is 500. So the money supply would be $500 billion. Looking at the options, option J is $500 billion. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, wait, but I should double-check the formula. Another way to remember is that Velocity of Money is how often each dollar buys a certain amount of goods and services. So if the velocity is 4, each dollar in circulation is used 4 times a year. So the total money in circulation (M) multiplied by the velocity (V) would give the total value of all transactions. So if I have M = 2000 /4 = 500, yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, sometimes people use nominal GDP as an approximation of M*V. So if GNP is $2,000 billion, and V is 4, then M is 2000 /4 = 500 billion. So the correct answer is J.

To determine the money supply, we use the equation from the quantity theory of money: 

\[
M \times V = \text{Nominal GDP}
\]

Here, the velocity of money (V) is given as 4, and the GNP (which is the same as nominal GDP) is $2,000 billion. Rearranging the equation to solve for the money supply (M):

\[
M = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{V} = \frac{2000}{4} = 500
\]

Thus, the money supply is $500 billion. Checking the options provided, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
