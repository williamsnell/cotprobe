Question:

In a cohort study of elderly women, the relative risk ratio for hip fractures among those who exercise regularly is 1.2 (95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8). Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture?

Options:

A: Statistically significant overall increase in risk
B: Statistically insignificant change in risk for those who exercise regularly
C: Statistically significant overall decrease in risk
D: Statistically nonsignificant decrease in risk
E: Statistically significant decrease in risk only for those over 80
F: Statistically significant overall decrease in risk for those who exercise regularly
G: Statistically nonsignificant overall decrease in risk
H: Statistically significant increase in risk only for those under 70
I: No statistically significant change in risk
J: Statistically nonsignificant increase in risk

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about a cohort study on elderly women's hip fractures and the effect of regular exercise. Hmm, I remember that cohort studies look at the association between exposure and outcome over a period, right? So here, they're looking at regular exercise as the exposure and hip fractures as the outcome.

The question says the relative risk ratio is 1.2 with a 95% CI of 1.1 to 1.8. Wait, relative risk is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group versus the unexposed group. So a risk ratio of 1.2 means that people who exercise regularly have 20% higher risk of hip fractures compared to those who don't. Because 1.2 is more than 1; if it were less than 1, that would mean a reduction. So yeah, here it's higher.

Now, the confidence interval is 1.1 to 1.8. Since the lower bound of the CI is 1.1, which is just above 1, that means that the confidence interval does not include 1. So that suggests that the effect is statistically significant. Because if the CI didn't include 1, we can reject the null hypothesis that there's no effect. So the change is statistically significant.

Wait, but what's the direction of the change? Because the risk ratio is 1.2. That means the risk is higher in the regular-exercise group compared to non-exercise. So it's an increase. So the conclusion should mention an increase in risk.

Now the options: looking at the answer choices.

Option A: Statistically significant overall increase in risk. That seems correct because the CI doesn't include 1, so the effect is significant, and the risk is higher.

Option B: insignificant change. Well, the CI doesn't include 1, so it's significant. So B is wrong.

Option C: Decrease. Doesn't fit because 1.2 is higher.

Option D: Nonsignificant decrease. No, since it's an increase, so D is wrong.

Option E: Decrease only for those over 80. But the question doesn't mention age. The study is about elderly women, so I don't think the effect is specific to age groups. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Significant decrease overall. Wrong, as the risk is increasing.

Option G: nonsignificant overall decrease. Also wrong.

Option H: Increase only for under 70. The question doesn't specify age. So H is wrong.

Option I: No statistically significant change. No, because the CI doesn't include 1, so it's statistically significant.

Option J: Increase. So, A is correct.

The question involves interpreting the results of a cohort study on elderly women's hip fractures and the effect of regular exercise on risk. The relative risk ratio is 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1â€“1.8), indicating that regular exercise increases hip fracture risk by 20%. The confidence interval does not include 1, meaning the change is statistically significant. Since the risk ratio is greater than 1, the conclusion is that regular exercise increases the risk of hip fractures.

- **Option A**: Correct. The confidence interval does not include 1, indicating a statistically significant increase.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The change is statistically significant because the CI does not include 1.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The risk ratio is higher than 1, indicating an increase.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The change is an increase, not a decrease.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The study does not specify age groups, so this conclusion is unwarranted.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The risk ratio is higher than 1, so this conclusion is wrong.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The change is an increase, not a decrease.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The change is an increase, so this conclusion is wrong.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The change is statistically significant, so this conclusion is wrong.
- **Option J**: Correct. The change is an increase, so this conclusion is correct.
