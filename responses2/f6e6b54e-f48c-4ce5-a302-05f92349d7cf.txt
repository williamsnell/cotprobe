Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's take it step by step. 

The patient is a 45-year-old man with right shoulder pain. He chopped wood two days ago. Let me think about what that might mean. Chop wood could lead to repetitive strain, especially if he's doing it daily. So, his shoulder might be inflamed or overused.

The exam findings: no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. So, no obvious issues like arthritis or tenderness at the points, which suggests it's not something like osteoarthritis. Point tenderness is more about tendons that are tender at the joint points, like the shoulder. So, maybe it's more than just a joint mass or something.

The pain is external rotation against resistance. So, when he tries to rotate his shoulder outward, it hurts. That usually points to tendons or muscles involved in that movement. External rotation is a common movement for the shoulder, so probably something related to the muscles that control it.

The question is about which tendon inflammation is most likely. The options are from the Brachii family, mostly. Let me recall what the major tendons are in the shoulder.

The shoulder has several tendons. The teres minor (also called the anterior teres minor) is a large tendon in the ulnar side of the shoulder. It's involved in rotation. The teres major is in the radial side and is more involved in rotation as well, but perhaps it's less involved in external rotation.

Looking at the options: the teres minor is option G. But wait, the question is about inflammation. So, the tendons involved in rotation would be the ones that are active in that movement.

Wait, the patient is experiencing pain during external rotation. So, the tendons and muscles that are active during that movement are the ones that are inflamed. The teres minor is part of the medial teres, which is more involved in rotation, perhaps, but also the teres major is radial.

Wait, another thought: the brachialis is a brachialis tendinum, and the brachii is the brachialis muscle. Oh wait, no. The Brachialis is a muscle, and its tendinum is called Brachialis tendinum. The brachialis itself is option J. The Brachialis is a brachii muscle, right? So J is the Brachialis muscle.

Wait, but the question is about the tendons, not the muscles. The tendons are the tendinums. So, the options are the tendinums, which are called something else. For example, the teres minor's tendinum is typically called the anterior teres minor tendinum. The teres major's is the radial teres major tendinum.

So, the question is, which tendon is most likely inflamed? The patient is experiencing pain when he tries to rotate externally, which suggests that the muscles or tendons involved in that rotation are inflamed.

In terms of shoulder movement, the anterior teres minor (G) is the tendinum for the medial rotation. The teres major is for the lateral rotation. External rotation is more of the radial side, perhaps involving the teres major.

Wait, no. The anterior teres minor is the medial rotation, and the anterior teres major (but that's not an option here. The options are the tendinums, not the muscles. So, the options for tendinums are G (anterior teres minor), H (infraspinatus), I (supraspinatus), D (triceps brachii), J (brachialis), etc.

Wait, let's think about the movement. External rotation is a movement that involves the radial side. The anterior teres minor (G) is involved in the medial rotation, which is the opposite direction. So, when rotating externally, the anterior teres major (but that's not an option) is involved. Alternatively, perhaps the infraspinatus is involved in external rotation?

Wait, infraspinatus is the medial rotation muscle, right? So, if the patient is rotating externally, his infraspinatus would be pulling him inward, but that's not what's described. Wait, no, infraspinatus is active in the medial rotation, so if the patient is trying to rotate externally, the infraspinatus is pulling him inward, so maybe that's not the one.

Alternatively, the infraspinatus is more involved in the medial rotation (like when you rotate your arm towards your head). Whereas the brachii is the radial side muscle, so its tendinum is involved in the external rotation.

Wait, the Brachii is the radial brachii muscle. The Brachialis is the muscle. So, the Brachialis tendinum (Brachialis tendinum) is the tendinum for the Brachialis muscle. Which is option J.

Alternatively, the Brachialis is a brachii muscle, and its tendinum is Brachialis tendinum (option J). So, if the patient is experiencing external rotation, the Brachialis tends to be involved because it's the radial side.

Wait, but the Brachialis is the Brachii muscle, right? So the tendinium would be called Brachialis tendinum. So, in the options, J is Brachialis, but the tendinium is J's tendinum. So, the question is, the patient is experiencing external rotation, so the tendinium (tendon) in question would be the Brachialis tendinum, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So, the patient is rotating externally. The tendinium that's involved in external rotation would be the Brachialis tendinum. So, that's J.

Alternatively, maybe the anterior teres minor. But wait, no, the anterior teres minor is for external rotation? Or perhaps the Brachialis is more directly involved.

Wait, another approach: when you rotate the shoulder externally, the muscles involved are the infraspinatus and brachialis. The Brachialis is the radial side muscle, so it's involved in the external rotation. So, if the patient is experiencing a Brachialis-tendinum inflammation, that would be the case.

Wait, but the Brachialis is the Brachii muscle, which is option J. So, the Brachialis tends to the Brachialis tendinum, which is option J.

Wait, but the other option is the teres minor. The anterior teres minor is the medial rotation. So, if the patient is rotating externally, then the Brachialis is the radial side. So, the Brachialis tendinum (option J) would be the one responsible.

Alternatively, perhaps the Brachialis is the one involved. So, the question is which tendinium is most likely inflamed.

Wait, the question is phrased: "inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?" So, it's about the tendons, not the muscles.

So, for the Brachialis, the tendinium is the Brachialis tendinum (option J). So, if the patient's rotation is external, the Brachialis tendinum is involved.

Alternatively, the anterior teres minor's tendinium is part of the shoulder's medial rotation, which is different.

Wait, but the options are about the tendons. So, if the patient is experiencing the tendinium from external rotation, which is the Brachialis tendinum, that's option J.

Wait, but wait another thought: the Brachialis is a brachii muscle. The Brachialis tendinium is option J. So, the patient's external rotation is likely due to the Brachialis muscle's tendinium, which is option J.

So, the answer would be option J: Brachialis.

The patient is a 45-year-old man who has experienced right shoulder pain following chopping wood two days ago. The pain is described as being reproduced when externally rotating the shoulder against resistance, and there is no weakness. The exam findings indicate no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness, suggesting the issue is not related to joint mass or tenderness at the joint points. The patient's pain is likely due to an inflamed tendinium involved in external rotation.

External rotation of the shoulder is a common movement, and the tendinium responsible is the Brachialis tendinium. The Brachialis is the radial brachii muscle, and its tendinium (Brachialis tendinum) is most likely inflamed in this patient. This is because Brachialis is directly involved in the external rotation of the shoulder, as the Brachialis muscle is the radial side of the shoulder and its tendinium plays a critical role in this movement.

Other tendiotes discussed in the options, such as the teres minor (G), infraspinatus (H), supraspinatus (I), triceps brachii (D), brachialis (J), and coracobrachialis (F), are less likely to be involved in this specific case since they do not directly contribute to external rotation. The Brachialis tendinium is the most relevant tendinium for the described injury.
