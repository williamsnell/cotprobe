Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about protons hitting a target and causing it to heat up. The rate at which the temperature increases is what we're after. Alright, let's read through the details.

So, protons have a mass of 1.67e-27 kg each. Their velocity is 2e7 m/s. The target has a mass of 1 gram, and a specific heat capacity of 0.334 cal/(g·°C·°C). Oh wait, wait. Specific heat capacity is usually given as c = 4.184 J/(g·°C) when in SI units. But wait, the problem says 0.334 cal/(g·g·°C). That's a bit confusing. Oh, because 1 cal is approximately 4.184 J. So, maybe the given specific heat is already in cal units, so I can just use it as is. So c = 0.334 cal/(g·°C).

The proton current is 4.8 microamperes. Micro is 1e-6, so 4.8e-6 A.

We need to find the rate at which the temperature of the target increases. And it says to consider that one-third of the protons' energy is converted into heat. So, first, I'll find the kinetic energy of each proton and then determine how much each contributes to heat when one-third is converted.

Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Let me compute that. The mass is 1.67e-27 kg. Velocity is 2e7 m/s.

Calculating v squared: (2e7)^2 =4e14 m²/s². So (1/2)*1.67e-27 kg *4e14 m²/s².

Multiplying: 0.5 *1.67e-27 *4e14 = 0.5 *6.68e-13 = 3.34e-13 joules per proton.

Wait, hold on. Let me check the calculation again. 1.67e-27 multiplied by 4e14 is (1.67 *4) =6.68, so 6.68e-13. Then times 0.5 is 3.34e-13 J per proton.

But wait, protons are moving, and the current is 4.8e-6 A. So each second, a charge passes through. Each charge is e, the charge of a proton is 1.6e-19 C. So the current is 4.8e-6 A, which is 4.8e-6 C/s. So the number of protons passing per second is current / charge per proton.

Number per second N = (4.8e-6 C/s) / (1.6e-19 C) )= 3e13 protons per second.

Wait, 4.8e-6 / 1.6e-19 = (4.8/1.6=3) * 1e13 = 3e13 protons per second.

So each second, 3e13 protons strike the target. Each has kinetic energy 3.34e-13 J, but wait, no. Wait, No. Wait, each proton's KE is 3.34e-13 J. So each second, the total energy is number * energy per proton.

So energy per second (power) is 3e13 protons/s * 3.34e-13 J/p = 3e13 * 3.34e-13 = 10.02 J/s. Wait, because 3e13 *3.34e-13 = (3 *3.34) * (1e13 *1e-13) )= 10.02 *1=10.02 J/s. So 10.02 watts.

But wait, no. Wait, each proton's KE is 3.34e-13 J. So each second, that's 3e13 *3.34e-13 = 3*3.34 =10.02 J/s. So 10.02 J/s of kinetic energy is transferred into heat. But since only one-third is converted, the heat power is (1/3)*10.02 J/s = 3.34 J/s. Because 10.02 /3 is about 3.34.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate: 10.02 J/s divided by 3 is approximately 3.34 J/s.

So each second, 3.34 J of heat is generated.

Now, how does this heat affect the target's temperature?

The target's mass is 1 gram. So, for the heat capacity, I'll use c = 0.334 cal/(g·°C). But wait, 1 cal is 4.184 J, so the heat capacity can be expressed in J/(g·°C) as 0.334 *4.184. Let me compute that.

0.334 *4.184 = approximately 1.401 J/(g·°C). Because 0.3*4.18=1.254, 0.034*4.18≈0.142, so total around 1.396. Let's say 1.396 J/(g·°C) for c.

The formula for temperature change is Q = mcΔT. So ΔT = Q/(m c).

So ΔT per second (since Q is 3.34 J/s) is 3.34 J/s divided by (1g *1.396 J/(g·°C)).

So m = 1g; c = 1.396 J/(g·°C).

So ΔT per second = 3.34 / (1 *1.396) ) = approx 2.40°C/s.

Wait, wait, but wait. No. Because the power is Q, so the time derivative of temperature is dT/dt = Q/(m c).

So 3.34 J/s divided by (1 g *1.396 J/(g·°C)) = 3.34 /1.396. Let's compute 3.34 /1.396.

1.396 is approximately 1.4. 3.34 divided by 1.4 is about 2.3857. So approximately 2.39°C/s.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.39°C per second.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck all the calculations.

Wait, each proton's KE is (1/2)mv².

m=1.67e-27 kg, v=2e7 m/s.

So (1/2) *1.67e-27 * (2e7)^2 = 0.5 *1.67e-27 *4e14 = 0.5 *6.68e-13 = 3.34e-13 J.

So per proton, 3.34e-13 J.

Number of protons per second is 4.8e-6 A * (1 C/e) / (1.6e-19 C) ) =4.8e-6 /1.6e-19 =3e13 protons/s.

So each second, 3e13 *3.34e-13 J = 10.02 J/s. That's 10.02 W.

Only 1/3 of that is converted to heat: 10.02 /3 ≈3.34 J/s.

Mass of target is 1 gram =0.001 kg. Wait wait, wait. Wait: m is 1 g, which is 0.001 kg. So the specific heat capacity is c=0.334 cal/(g·°C) → but when calculating, should I convert it to J/(g·°C)? Because the units matter.

Wait no, because in the formula, the units of c are J/(g·°C) when using J. Let me check:

Wait, the specific heat formula is Q = mcΔT → m in grams, c in J/(g·°C). So if I use c in J/(g·°C), then the units will be correct.

So c is 0.334 cal/(g·°C) = 0.334 *4.184 J/(g·°C) = approximately 1.401 J/(g·°C).

So, the heat per second (Q) is 3.34 J/s.

So ΔT = Q/(m c) = 3.34 J/s / ( (0.001 kg) *1.401 J/(g·°C) )

Wait, wait, wait, but 1 kg is 1000 grams. So m is 1 gram → 0.001 kg.

But in the formula, Q is in J, m is in kg. So let me redo the calculation.

Wait, the formula is ΔT = Q/(m c) where m is in grams, c in J/(g·°C). So m is 1 gram.

So Q is 3.34 J/s.

So ΔT =3.34 J/s / (1 g *1.401 J/(g·°C)).

So 3.34 /1.401 = approximately 2.385°C/s.

Which is about 2.39°C per second. So the answer should be option J.

To determine the rate at which the temperature of the target initially rises, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Kinetic Energy of Protons**:  
   The kinetic energy of each proton is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
   \]  
   Substituting \(m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\) and \(v = 2 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}\):  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^7)^2 = 3.34 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Number of Protons per Second**:  
   The current is \(4.8 \, \mu\text{A} = 4.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{A}\). The charge of a proton is \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}\). Thus, the number of protons per second is:  
   \[
   N = \frac{\text{current}}{\text{charge per proton}} = \frac{4.8 \times 10^{-6}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 3 \times 10^{13} \, \text{protons/s}
   \]

3. **Total Power (Heat)**:  
   Each proton contributes \(3.34 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}\) of kinetic energy per second. Therefore, the total power generated is:  
   \[
   P = N \times KE = 3 \times 10^{13} \times 3.34 \times 10^{-13} = 10.02 \, \text{W}
   \]  
   Since one-third of the energy is converted into heat, the heat power is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{heat}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 10.02 = 3.34 \, \text{J/s}
   \]

4. **Temperature Rise**:  
   The target has a mass of \(1 \, \text{g} = 0.001 \, \text{kg}\) and a specific heat capacity \(c = 0.334 \, \text{cal/(g·°C)}\). Converting \(c\) to \(J/(g·°C)\):  
   \[
   c = 0.334 \times 4.184 = 1.401 \, \text{J/(g·°C)}
   \]  
   Using the formula \(\Delta T = \frac{Q}{m c}\), where \(Q = 3.34 \, \text{J/s}\), \(m = 0.001 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{g}\), and \(c = 1.401 \, \text{J/(g·°C)}\):  
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{3.34}{1 \times 1.401} \approx 2.39 \, \text{°C/s}
   \]

5. **Critical Analysis of Options**:  
   The calculated temperature rise rate is approximately \(2.39 \, \text{°C/s}\), which matches option **J**.
