Okay, so I've got this problem here about Buzz Reinhaus's earnings. Let's see, I need to calculate his total earnings for the week. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says he worked 63 hours last week. But he's paid different rates for different hours. He was paid time and a half for 15 hours and double time for 9 hours. His regular rate is $2.60 per hour. Wait, wait, I think I should make sure I understand the payment structure.

So, time and a half and double time. That means for hours worked beyond regular hours, they're paid differently. Regular hours are typically the standard 40 hours, but sometimes they're considered as 40 hours, and any hours beyond that are paid at time and a half or double. But wait, the question doesn't specify whether his regular hours are 40 or if the 15 and 9 are in addition. Hmm, but I think in many cases, the standard is 40 regular hours, and any hours beyond that are considered overtime.

Wait, but the problem states he worked 63 hours total. Let me think. So, 15 hours at time and a half and 9 hours at double time. Adding those up: 15 + 9 = 24 hours. So that's 24 hours of overtime or extra time beyond regular. But wait, if the regular hours are 40, then he worked 24 hours overtime. But wait, 24 plus 40 is 64, which is over. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says he worked 63 hours in total. Of those, 15 hours are paid at time and a half, and 9 hours are paid at double time. So the total regular hours would be 15 + 9 = 24 hours. But wait, that can't be right because 24 hours plus regular hours (say, 40) would be 64, but he only worked 63. So perhaps the regular hours are 40, and the extra 3 hours are overtime? Or maybe the 15 and 9 are the time and a half and double time hours, so total hours worked is 24, which is under 40, meaning he didn't qualify for any overtime. So, he's only paid 15 at time and a half, 9 at double, and 24 - 40? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 15 +9 =24. So perhaps he worked 24 hours of overtime (time and a half or double time) and 36 hours of regular. But wait, no, that doesn't add up because 24 + 40 is 64, which is more than 63. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the regular hours are 40, and the 15 and 9 are the overtime. So 15 +9 =24 hours of overtime. But 24 hours would be more than 63? Wait, no, 15 is time and a half, 9 is double. So adding those up, 15 +9 =24. So he worked 24 hours of overtime, but his total hours are 63. So 63 minus 24 is 39 regular hours. But that can't be right, because 39 +24=63. Wait, but that's 63 hours in total, which is less than 40 regular. Wait, perhaps no, because 39 is less than 40, so he didn't qualify for any overtime. So all 24 hours are overtime.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's read the problem again: "He was paid time and a half for 15 hours and double time for 9 hours." So the 15 and 9 are the hours for the respective pay rates. So 15 is time and a half, 9 is double time, totaling 24 hours. So that's 24 hours of overtime, and the rest would be regular hours, but how?

Wait, the total hours worked is 63. So if 24 are paid at overtime, then the remaining 63 -24=39 hours would be regular. But that can't be because 39 is less than 40. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the 15 and 9 are the overtime hours. So 15 hours at time and a half, and 9 hours at double time. So 15 +9=24. So that's 24 hours of overtime. But the total hours are 63. So 63 -24=39 regular hours. But that's not possible because 39 regular hours would mean he's paid 39 hours of regular time, but his regular rate is 2.60. So 39*2.60 would be 101.40. But let me calculate his earnings.

Wait, but if he worked 24 hours at overtime, that's 24 hours. Wait, but 15 at time and a half and 9 at double time. So 15 +9=24. So this would be 24 hours of overtime. But 24 is less than 40, so he didn't qualify for any regular hours. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 15+9=24. So he worked 24 hours overtime.

Wait, let's think about the total earnings. He earned 15 hours at 1.5 times his regular rate and 9 hours at 2 times. His regular rate is $2.60 per hour.

So for the 15 hours: 15 * (1.5 * 2.60) = 15 * 3.90 = 58.50.

For the 9 hours: 9 * (2 * 2.60) = 9 * 5.20 = 46.80.

So total would be 58.50 +46.80 = 105.30. But wait, the options don't have 105, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, but the options are way higher. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the 15 and 9 are the regular hours, and the rest are overtime. But that can't be, because 15+9=24, and 63-24=39, which is more than regular hours. Wait, wait, perhaps he worked 24 regular hours and 39 overtime. So let me recalculate.

Wait, no, the problem says he was paid time and a half for 15 hours and double time for 9 hours. So those are the respective hours. So the 15 is OT and 9 is double OT. So 15 +9=24. So total hours: 24 (OT) + 39 (regular) =63. Because 24 +39=63.

Wait, but 39 is more than 40, which is the standard. Oh, wait, perhaps the regular hours are 40, so he worked 39 regular hours. So 39 regular, 24 OT.

So let's calculate.

Regular hours: 39 hours. So 39 * $2.60 = ?

Let me compute that: 39 * 2.60.

39 * 2 =78, and 39 * 0.60=23.40. So 78+23.40=101.40.

Overtime: 24 hours at double time: 24 * 2 * 2.60 = 24 *5.20.

Wait, 24 * 5 is 120, and 24 *0.20=4.80. So 120+4.80=124.80.

Now, total earnings: 101.40 +124.80=226.20.

Wait, looking at the options, option H is 223.80, which is close but not exactly 226.20. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the 15 and 9 are the regular hours, and he's paid double for 9 and 1.5 for 15. Then the total hours would be 15 +9=24 regular hours, and the rest 63-24=39 OT.

But that's 24 regular +39 OT, which is 63. But that would mean he's earning 24 regular hours and 39 OT.

But wait, the problem says he was paid time and a half for 15 hours and double time for 9 hours. So the 15 and 9 are the respective hours. So that would mean he worked 15 hours at 1.5x and 9 hours at 2x. So total hours: 24. He worked 63 in total, so 63-24=39 regular hours.

So regular hours are 39. So 39 *2.60=101.40.

OT: 15*1.5*2.60 +9*2*2.60.

Compute OT:

15 *1.5 is 22.5. 22.5 *2.60=58.50.

9 *2=18. 18 *2.60=46.80.

Total OT: 58.50 +46.80=105.30.

Total earnings: 101.40 +105.30=206.70.

Looking at the options, option B is 206.70. So that's the answer.

Wait, but why did I think 39 was more than 40 before? Oh, maybe I was mixing the regular hours. So yes, 24 OT and 39 regular. So total is 206.70, which is option B.

To calculate Buzz's total earnings for the week:

1. **Understand the payment structure:**
   - Regular rate: $2.60 per hour.
   - Time and a half: 1.5 times the regular rate.
   - Double time: 2 times the regular rate.
   - Overtime hours: Any hours worked beyond 40 hours per week are paid at double time.

2. **Break down the hours:**
   - Time and a half: 15 hours.
   - Double time: 9 hours.
   - Total overtime hours: 15 + 9 = 24 hours.

3. **Determine the regular hours worked:**
   - Total hours worked: 63.
   - Hours worked as overtime: 24.
   - Therefore, regular hours worked: 63 - 24 = 39 hours.

4. **Calculate earnings from regular hours:**
   - Regular pay: 39 hours * $2.60/hour = $101.40.

5. **Calculate earnings from overtime hours:**
   - Time and a half pay: 15 hours * 1.5 * $2.60/hour = $58.50.
   - Double time pay: 9 hours * 2 * $2.60/hour = $46.80.
   - Total overtime pay: $58.50 + $46.80 = $105.30.

6. **Sum up the earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $101.40 + $105.30 = $206.70.

**Answer:** B) $206.70
