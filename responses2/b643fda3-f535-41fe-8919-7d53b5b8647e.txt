Okay, so I've got this question here with two statements and four options about their truth values. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

Statement 1 says: If H and K are subgroups of G, and one of them is a normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G. Hmm. I remember that when one subgroup is normal, certain things hold. Let me think. So, if H is normal in G, then for any k in K, the conjugate of H by k is still in K because normality ensures that the cosets are well-behaved. Wait, but how does that affect HK being a subgroup?

I think the product of two subgroups H and K is a subgroup if and only if HK = KH. So, whether one is normal probably affects whether the product is a subgroup. If H is normal, then K is a subset of HK, and because HK = KH (because H is normal), yes, HK is a subgroup. Wait, no, that's not entirely correct. Let me rephrase. If H is normal, then for any k in K, kHk^{-1} = H. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the exact condition here.

Alternatively, another approach: when H is normal, then the product HK is indeed a subgroup. Because in that case, the product is equal to KH, since for any h in H and k in K, k h k^{-1} is in H. So, this would make HK equal to KH, which is a subgroup. So Statement 1 should be true. I think I've read that before.

Statement 2 says: All groups of order p squared, where p is prime, are Abelian. Wait, p squared is the order. So groups of order p^2, for prime p. Let me think about the structure. For p â‰  2, the group of order p^2 is abelian because it's a direct product of two cyclic groups of order p. But wait, for p=2, does that hold? Let me think. For p=2, the group of order 4. The possible groups are the cyclic group of order 4 and the Klein four-group. Both are abelian. So for any prime p, the group of order p^2 is abelian. So Statement 2 is true.

So now, looking at the options:

Looking at the options, option D says both are true. Option A says Statement 1 is conditionally True, which I think is correct, and Statement 2 is False. But I just reasoned Statement 2 is True. So that can't be option A. Option D is both True, which seems right.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check Statement 1. Suppose H is normal, and K is any subgroup. So, is HK a subgroup? Because in general, HK is a subgroup only if H and K commute, but in this case, H is normal. So H being normal implies that HK = KH, which would make HK a subgroup since it's equal to its own inverse (since each element is its own inverse, perhaps? Or maybe not, but the inverse is in H, so since K is a group, HK is closed under multiplication and inverses.)

Wait, another way: Suppose H is normal. Then for any h in H and k in K, the product kh is also in HK, and the inverse (kh)^-1 = h^{-1}k^{-1} = (k^{-1}h^{-1}) because H is normal. Since K is a subgroup, k^{-1} is in K, and H is normal, so k^{-1}h^{-1} is in H. So the inverse is in H, which is part of HK, so yes, HK is closed under inverses. So HK is a subgroup of G.

So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true. So the correct answer's option D: True, True.
</think>

The correct answer is:

D: True, True

Explanation:

- **Statement 1**: True. If H is a normal subgroup of G, then HK is indeed a subgroup of G. This is because H being normal ensures that HK = KH, which satisfies the subgroup criteria (closure, identity, inverses).
  
- **Statement 2**: True. All groups of order \( p^2 \) (where p is prime) are abelian. This is because any such group is either cyclic or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, both of which are abelian. For p=2, the Klein four-group is also abelian.

Both statements are true, so the correct option is D.

Answer: D
