Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about international tribunals and how they relate to national courts. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking whether the jurisdiction of international tribunals follows the same principles as national courts. The options are A, B, C, and D. I remember that tribunals are separate from regular courts, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact principles they share.

Option A says that the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts are also common to international tribunals. That seems plausible because both would have rules about how courts operate, like the types of cases they handle, trials, and reviews. But I'm not sure if this is the case.

Option B claims that all international tribunals are regulated by the UN Security Council. Wait, the UN Security Council has specific members, and tribunals are often part of this council. But I don't think every single international tribunal is under the same Security Council framework. Some might be under other resolutions or not tied to the council. So B doesn't sound right.

Option C suggests that international tribunals share some principles but not all. That makes sense because not all tribunals operate the same way. For example, some might have a higher bar, while others might have more lenient rules. So they don't share all jurisdictional principles, even if some overlap.

Option D states that the jurisdiction is dictated solely by the founding treaties. I'm not too sure about this. International tribunals are more about the specific cases these countries have set up, like in the European Union or Latin American countries. Their functioning isn't solely based on the founding treaties, which govern countries' internal laws. So D seems incorrect.

Putting it together, option C seems the best choice. International tribunals share some principles, like the structure of trials and the importance of witnesses, but they don't have all the same rules. They might have some unique aspects, but not all jurisdictional principles are shared.

The correct answer is:

**C: International tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts**

**Explanation:**
International tribunals operate under principles such as the role of witnesses and the importance of trials, which are similar to national courts. However, they differ in their specific cases, such as those in the European Union or Latin American countries, which are governed by founding treaties not necessarily enforcing all jurisdictional principles. Thus, while some overlap exists, not all, making option C the accurate choice.
