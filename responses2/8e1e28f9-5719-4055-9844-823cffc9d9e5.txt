Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the ID3 algorithm and probability distributions. Let me break it down step by step.

Statement 1 says that the ID3 algorithm is guaranteed to find the optimal decision tree. Hmm, I remember that ID3 is a decision tree algorithm, but I'm not sure about its optimality. I think it's greedy, right? It chooses the attribute that gives the highest information gain at each step. But wait, is it guaranteed to find the optimal tree? Oh, right, I recall that ID3 doesn't always produce the minimal size optimal tree because it uses information gain, which doesn't always lead to the minimal depth. There's also something about the greedy approach leading to suboptimal trees, especially in cases where attributes with high information gain are selected even if they might result in worse trees later on. So, Statement 1 might be false because ID3 doesn't guarantee an optimal decision tree.

Statement 2 talks about a continuous probability distribution where the density f(x) is non-zero everywhere. The probability of a value x is f(x). That seems correct because in probability, the density function f(x) doesn't have to be zero except on a set of measure zero. So Statement 2 is probably true.

Now, looking at the options. The options are about the truth values of the two statements. The first part is about whether each is true or false. So, Statement 1 is false (as I thought), and Statement 2 is true (it's correct about the probability density function). So the pair is (False, True).

Looking at the options:
Option B is False, True. So, that's option B.

The first statement is false because the ID3 algorithm does not guarantee an optimal decision tree. The second statement is true because a continuous probability distribution with a non-zero density function correctly represents the probability of a value x. 

**Answer: B**
