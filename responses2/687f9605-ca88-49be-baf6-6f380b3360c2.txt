Okay, so I have this question about Lebesgue measurability, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what’s being asked.

The question says: Given a point set E. For any closed set F and open set G such that F is a subset of E and E is a subset of G, it holds that the supremum of m(F) is less than the infimum of m(G). Then, the question is whether E is Lebesgue measurable. I need to determine if E is measurable, and answer with 1 for yes and 0 for no.

Hmm, I remember that Lebesgue measurability is related to the property that the measure of a set is consistent with the way it's approximated by open and closed sets. So, if E can be approximated from inside by closed sets F with m(F) approaching m(E) and from outside by open sets G with m(G) approaching m(E), then E is measurable.

Wait, the condition given in the question is a bit different. It says that for any F closed and G open with F subset E subset G, sup_F m(F) < inf_G m(G). Let me unpack that.

Suppose E is not measurable. Then, by the definition of measurability, there exists some set E where the measure can't be approximated in that particular way. But if E isn't measurable, then there exists a closed F and open G such that F is a subset of E, which is a subset of G. But in this case, the supremum of m(F) is less than the infimum of m(G). That seems like a contradiction because if E isn't measurable, it shouldn't be possible for this inequality to hold. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. If E is measurable, then for any F and G as described, the measure of E should be sandwiched between the measures of F and G. But here, the measure of E is less than or greater than? The condition is that sup F < inf G, which would imply that m(E) is less than m(E), which is impossible. So, maybe the condition given implies that E cannot be non-measurable. Because if it were non-measurable, we'd have that situation where the interior and exterior measures are inconsistent, leading to the inequality. 

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. The Lebesgue measure is inner regular for open sets and outer regular for closed sets, but for non-measurable sets, these regularities don't hold. So, if E is measurable, then for any open set containing E, the measure of E is less than or equal to the measure of the open set. Similarly, for any closed set contained in E, the measure of E is greater than or equal to the measure of the closed set.

So, if E is measurable, for any F ⊂ E ⊂ G, we have m(F) ≤ m(E) ≤ m(G). So, the supremum of m(F) for all F ⊂ E closed would be less than or equal to m(E), and the infimum of m(G) for all G ⊃ E open would be greater than or equal to m(E). So, in the case where E is measurable, we would have sup_F m(F) ≤ m(E) and inf_G m(G) ≥ m(E), which would mean that sup m(F) ≤ inf m(G). But the condition in the question says that sup m(F) < inf m(G). So, in the case of a measurable set, the inequality would be strict.

Wait, but the question says for any F and G, sup_F m(F) < inf_G m(G). So, for a measurable set E, we have this strict inequality, which would contradict the definition of measurability. Because, for a measurable set, the supremum of measures of all closed subsets F of E would be equal to m(E), and similarly, the infimum of measures of all open supersets G would be equal to m(E). So, the inequality in the question, which is strict, would not hold for a measurable set.

Wait, but that's exactly the opposite. If E is measurable, then sup_F m(F) = m(E) and inf_G m(G) = m(E), so sup < inf is not possible. But the question's condition says that sup < inf. So, this would imply that E cannot be measurable because if it were, the condition would not hold. Therefore, the only way for the condition to hold is if E is measurable, because otherwise, the strict inequality would be impossible.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me rephrase. If E is measurable, then for any F ⊂ E closed, m(F) ≤ m(E), and for any G ⊃ E open, m(E) ≤ m(G). So, the supremum of m(F) over all F ⊂ E is m(E), and the infimum of m(G) over G ⊃ E is m(E). So, the condition in the question, which is sup < inf, would not hold for a measurable set.

Wait, but the question says that for any F and G, sup F < inf G. So, if E is measurable, then the inequality can't hold because it would be equal. Therefore, the condition in the question can only be true if E is not measurable. Because if E were measurable, then the inequality is not satisfied. 

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose E is not measurable. Then, there exists an F (closed) and G (open) such that F ⊂ E ⊂ G. Now, for F, since it's closed, m(F) ≤ m(E). Similarly, for G, since it's open, m(E) ≤ m(G). So, the supremum of m(F) over all F ⊂ E is m(E), and the infimum of m(G) over all G ⊃ E is m(E). So, the condition in the question, which is that sup < inf, would not hold for a non-measurable E. Because, for a non-measurable E, you can find F and G where m(F) is as close to m(E) as possible, but the infimum of m(G) is greater than m(E), making the inequality strict.

Wait, no. If E is non-measurable, then there exists some F and G such that F ⊂ E ⊂ G. But the supremum of m(F) over all F ⊂ E would be less than or equal to m(E), and the infimum of m(G) over all G ⊇ E would be greater than or equal to m(E). So, the condition is that sup < inf. So, for non-measurable E, this can happen because m(F) can be less than m(E) and m(G) can be more than m(E), making the inequality strict. But for a measurable E, the sup and inf would both be equal to m(E), so the inequality can't hold.

Therefore, the condition in the question implies that E must not be measurable. Because if E were measurable, the inequality would not hold. So, the answer should be 0 for yes, because E is not measurable.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "Is set E Lebesgue measurable?" So, if the condition in the question holds, then E can't be measurable. So, the set E is not Lebesgue measurable, which would answer the question as 0.

Wait, but the question is asking whether E is measurable. So, if E satisfies the condition, which would prevent it from being measurable, then the answer is 0. So, the answer is no, E is not measurable.

So, the answer should be 0. Looking at the options, option J is 0. So, the correct answer is J.
</think>

The condition given implies that for any closed set F and open set G containing E, the measure of F is less than the measure of G. This strict inequality suggests that E cannot be measurable because, by the properties of measure, a measurable set would have measures equal to the supremum of F and infimum of G, making the inequality impossible. Therefore, E is not Lebesgue measurable.

Answer: J.
