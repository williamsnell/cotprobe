Okay, so I've got this economics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the full-employment GDP and the actual GDP, along with the marginal propensity to consume. I remember that the multiplier effect is involved here. 

The problem says the full-employment GDP is $1.3 trillion, and the actual GDP is $1.2 trillion. Hmm, wait, no, the actual GDP is less than full-employment, so maybe there's a recession. But the question is about increasing government expenditures to get full employment. Oh right, because if the economy is below full employment, increasing spending can stimulate it.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8. I think the formula for the spending multiplier is 1 divided by (1 - MPC). So 1/(1-0.8) = 1/0.2 = 5. So each dollar spent by the government will lead to a $5 increase in GDP. 

Wait, but the actual GDP is below full employment. So the gap is the difference between full and actual. Full is 1.3, actual is 1.2, so the gap is $0.1 trillion, which is $100 billion.

To close this gap, we need to find out how much government spending needs to be increased. Since the multiplier is 5, each dollar of spending will add $5 to the GDP. So the required increase in government spending G is such that 5*G equals the needed increase to close the $100 billion gap.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is: ΔG * multiplier = ΔY, where ΔY is the change in GDP. So ΔG = ΔY / multiplier.

But what's the change needed? We need the actual GDP to reach full employment, which is $1.3 trillion. So the current GDP is $1.2 trillion. So the needed adjustment is +$100 billion.

So ΔY = $100 billion. So ΔG = 100 / 5 = $20 billion. So the government needs to increase spending by $20 billion.

Looking at the options, option E is $20 billion. So the answer should be E.

The full-employment GDP is $1.3 trillion, and the actual GDP is $1.2 trillion, creating a $100 billion GDP gap. With a marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of 0.8, the spending multiplier is calculated as 1/(1−0.8) = 5. To close the $100 billion gap, the required increase in government expenditures is $100 billion divided by the multiplier, which is $20 billion.
