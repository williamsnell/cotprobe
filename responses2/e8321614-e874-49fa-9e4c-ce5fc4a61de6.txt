Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So the question is, if 3 cans of pears cost $2.37, how many cans can I buy for $9.48? The options are A to J, with various numbers. Hmm, I need to find out how many cans I can purchase with $9.48.

First, I think I should find out how much each can of pears costs. If 3 cans cost $2.37, then one can would be 2.37 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 2.37 divided by 3 is... 0.79 dollars per can. Wait, that's 79 cents per can. Let me double-check that division. 3 into 2.37 would be 0.79 because 3 times 0.79 is 2.37. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, I have $9.48 to spend. I need to see how many cans I can buy at $0.79 each. So I'll divide 9.48 by 0.79. Let me do that calculation. Hmm, 9.48 divided by 0.79. Let me think: 0.79 times 12 is... 9.48 because 0.79 *10=7.90 and 0.79*2=1.58, adding up to 9.48. Oh wait, that's exactly the amount I have. So 12 cans would cost exactly 9.48 dollars. That means I can buy 12 cans of pears.

Looking at the options, I see option C is 12 cans. So the correct answer should be C. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should check another way. Let's see, 3 cans for $2.37. So for each can, it's 0.79. For 12 cans, 12 times 0.79 is 9.48. Yep, that's correct. So I think option C is right.

To determine how many cans of pears can be bought for $9.48, first find the cost per can: $2.37 divided by 3 equals $0.79 per can. Then, divide the total amount available ($9.48) by the cost per can ($0.79), which gives exactly 12 cans. Thus, the correct answer is C) 12 cans.

Answer: C
