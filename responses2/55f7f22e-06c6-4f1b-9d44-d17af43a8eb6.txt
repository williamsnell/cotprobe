Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that 0.0025 moles of a weak, monoprotic acid is dissolved in 0.250 L of distilled water. Then, the pH is measured as 4.26. I need to find the pKa of this weak acid from the given options. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that for weak acids, the pH measurement tells us about the concentration of H+ ions, which relates to the ionization of the acid. Since it's a monoprotic acid, it only donates one proton, so the acid HA dissociates into H+ and A-.

The formula for the pH is pH = -log[H+]. So from the pH given, I can find the [H+] concentration. Let's calculate that. pH is 4.26, so [H+] is 10^-4.26. Let me compute that. Oh wait, 10^-4 is 0.0001, 10^-0.26 is about 0.548. So 0.0001 * 0.548 is 5.48e-5 M. So [H+] is approximately 5.48e-5 M.

But wait, for a weak acid, the [H+] isn't just equal to the concentration of the acid, right? Because the acid is weak, it doesn't fully ionize. So the [H+] is much less than the initial concentration of A-.

The acid HA dissociates as HA ↔ H+ + A-. The initial concentration of HA is 0.0025 mol in 0.250 L, so the initial concentration is 0.0025/0.250. Let me calculate that: 0.0025 divided by 0.25 is 0.01 M. So [HA] = 0.01 M initially.

But the H+ concentration is 5.48e-5, which is much smaller than 0.01. So the change in [HA] is going to be small, but I can't neglect it. Let me think about the equilibrium expression.

The acid dissociation constant Ka is given by Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA]. Since HA is weak, HA is approximately 0.01 M at equilibrium. Also, [H+] is 5.48e-5, so [A-] is also 5.48e-5. So substituting into Ka:

Ka = (5.48e-5)*(5.48e-5) / 0.00952. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Let me compute each part. 

Wait, initial concentration of HA is 0.01 M. The change is x, so [HA] = 0.01 - x, [H+] = x, [A-] = x. So x is about 5.48e-5. So the numerator is x², which is (5.48e-5)^2. Let me calculate that:

(5.48e-5)^2 = (5.48)^2 * (1e-10) ≈ 30.0 * 1e-10 = 3e-9.

Denominator is [HA] = 0.01 - x. Since x is about 5.48e-5, which is much smaller than 0.01, so denominator is approximately 0.01. So Ka ≈ 3e-9 / 0.01 = 3e-7.

Wait, but wait, the question is about pKa, which is -log(Ka). So if Ka is 3e-7, then pKa is about 6.52. Because log(3e-7) is log(3) + log(1e-7) = 0.477 -7 = -6.52. So pKa is 6.52.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.52. But wait, let me double-check. Because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me redo the Ka calculation.

[H+] = 10^-4.26. Let me compute that more accurately. 10^-4 is 0.0001, 10^-0.26 is about 0.548 (since log(0.548) is about -0.26). So 0.0001 * 0.548 = 5.48e-5. So [H+] is 5.48e-5.

So [H+] squared is (5.48e-5)^2. Let me compute that: 5.48 *5.48 is 30.0 (approx), so 30.0e-10 = 3e-9.

Denominator: [HA] is 0.0025 mol / 0.250 L = 0.01 mol/L = 0.01 M. So 3e-9 / 0.01 = 3e-7.

So Ka is 3e-7. Then pKa is -log(3e-7). Let's compute that.

Log(3e-7) = log(3) + log(1e-7) = 0.4771 -7 = -6.523. So pKa is 6.523. So approximately 6.52. Looking at the options, option E is 6.52.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 6.52, option J is 7.00. Hmm. Is there a mistake here?

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, did I mess up the calculation of [H+]?

Wait, initial pH is 4.26, so [H+] is 10^-4.26. Let me compute this using exact calculation.

Using a calculator: 10^-4.26 is 10^(-4 - 0.26) = 10^-4 * 10^-0.26.

Compute 10^-0.26.

Log(0.548) is approximately -0.26, because log(0.548)= log(548/1000) = log(5.48e2) → wait no, wait. Wait, log(0.548) is negative. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me use a calculator approach.

I know that log(0.5) is -0.3010, log(0.548) is about which?

Using the approximation: Let me think of 0.548. Let me compute it.

Wait, perhaps another approach. 10^0.26 is about 1.82 (since 10^0.26 ≈ e^(0.26 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.26 *2.3026) ≈ e^(0.59867) ≈ 1.82). So 10^(-0.26) is 1/1.82 ≈ 0.5488. So [H+] = 1e-4 * 0.5488 = 5.488e-5 M.

So that part is correct. So [H+] is 5.488e-5.

So [H+]^2 is (5.488e-5)^2 = (5.488)^2 * (1e-10) → around 30.1e-10 → 3.01e-9.

So Ka is (3.01e-9) / (0.01) = 3.01e-7.

So pKa is -log(3.01e-7) → let's compute that.

Log(3.01e-7) = log(3.01) + log(1e-7) = 0.48 + (-7) → -6.52. So pKa is 6.52. So among the options, E is 6.52.

Wait, but wait. The options given are A to J. Let me check. The options are:

A: 3.80

B:5.75

C:8.52

D:9.25

E:6.52

F:8.75

G:4.26

H:6.00

I:7.92

J:7.00

So the correct answer is E, 6.52.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I forget to consider the activity coefficients or something? No, because this is a weak acid, and the activity coefficients aren't significant here because the simplification is to consider ionization as HA ↔ H+ + A-.

Another thought: perhaps the calculation of the weak acid's dissociation is more accurately handled using the expression for the acid dissociation. Let me set up the equation again.

The initial concentration of HA is 0.01 M. When it dissociates, it releases x mol/L of H+ and x mol/L of A-. So [HA] = 0.01 - x, [H+] = x, [A-] = x.

Ka = (x^2)/(0.01 - x) = (x^2)/(0.01 -x).

We know x is about 5.48e-5, so 0.01 - x ≈ 0.00999952, which is approximately 0.01.

So, approximating, we can write Ka ≈ x² / 0.01 → x² = Ka * 0.01.

We know x is 5.48e-5, so x² is 3.0e-9. So, 3e-9 = Ka * 0.01 → Ka = 3e-7. Thus, pKa = 6.52.

So the answer is E.

To determine the pKa of the weak monoprotic acid, we start by calculating the concentration of H⁺ ions from the given pH. The pH is 4.26, so:

\[
[H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-4.26} \approx 5.48 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The initial concentration of the weak acid (HA) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Initial concentration of HA} = \frac{\text{moles of HA}}{\text{volume of solution}} = \frac{0.0025}{0.250} = 0.01 \, \text{M}.
\]

The dissociation of HA is represented by:

\[
HA \leftrightharpoons H^+ + A^-.
\]

Using the equilibrium expression for the acid dissociation constant \(K_a\):

\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}.
\]

At equilibrium, \([H^+] = [A^-] = x\), and \([HA] = 0.01 - x\). Since \(x\) is much smaller than 0.01, we approximate \([HA] \approx 0.01\). Substituting the values:

\[
K_a = \frac{(5.48 \times 10^{-5})^2}{0.01} = \frac{3.01 \times 10^{-9}}{0.01} = 3.01 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

The pKa is then calculated as:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log_{10}(K_a) = -\log_{10}(3.01 \times 10^{-7}) \approx 6.52.
\]

Thus, the pKa of the weak acid is approximately 6.52. Among the given options, the correct answer is:
