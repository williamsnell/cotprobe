Okay, so I've got this Doppler shift question here. Hmm, Doppler shift is when the frequency of a wave changes because the source or the detector is moving relative to the medium. I remember that if the source is moving towards the observer, the frequency increases, and if it's moving away, it decreases. Same goes for the detector; if it's moving towards the source, the frequency increases, and if moving away, decreases.

The question is asking which situation results in no perceived Doppler shift. Wait, wait—no shift? So the source and detector are moving in such a way that their relative motion doesn't affect the observed frequency. Or perhaps, their motions are such that the Doppler effect cancels out? Or maybe the observer is right next to the source, so the movement doesn't change the frequency.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both are rotating around a common axis. Hmm. If both are moving in the same rotational direction, they might approach each other or move in a way that their relative motion doesn't change the Doppler shift. Wait, but if they're moving in circles, their velocities are tangential. So if both have the same rotational speed but opposite directions, maybe they won't have a net relative motion. Or, wait, if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed could be zero. So when their velocities add up, their relative motion might not cause a Doppler shift. I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option B: The detector travels toward the stationary source. Then the Doppler shift would be positive, so there would be a shift. So this can't be the correct answer.

Option C: Both move in the same direction. If they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference. For example, if both are moving to the right, and the source is moving faster than the detector, then from the detector's perspective, the source is moving towards it. So the source would appear to be moving towards the detector, causing a Doppler shift. Wait, but if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed is source speed minus detector speed. If source speed is higher, then the source is moving away from the detector, so no shift. Wait no, wait: if both are moving to the right, and the source is moving faster than the detector, then from the detector's frame, the source's speed towards it is (source speed - detector speed), but if the source is moving faster, then the source is moving away. But that would cause a Doppler shift. Unless the relative speed is zero. Hmm, so if both have the same speed, same direction, then the source is moving away at speed zero. Wait, no: if their speeds are same, then the source is moving away from the detector. So no shift. Therefore, this situation (C) would result in no shift. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to H. So option C is both moving same direction. So if both have the same speed, same direction, then the source is moving away from the detector, so no shift. So this would result in no Doppler shift. So if C is the correct answer, but looking at the options:

Wait, let me look again. Wait, the options are:

A: Both rotating around a common axis.

B: detector moving toward a stationary source.

C: both moving same direction.

D: source moving away from stationary detector.

E: both moving opposite, source and detector moving away from each other.

F: source moving toward the stationary detector.

G: source and detector move opposite, source moving towards detector.

H: detector moving away from source.

Wait, the question is about NO perceived Doppler shift. So when is there no shift?

Another scenario: if the source and detector are both stationary. Then no Doppler shift. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, when the source and detector are moving at the same speed in opposite directions, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step.

Wait, the Doppler shift depends on the relative velocity between source and observer. The formula is f' = f * (v + vO)/(v - vS), where v is the speed of sound in the medium, vO is the velocity of the observer towards the source, and vS is the velocity of the source away from the observer. 

For no shift, f' = f. So (v + vO)/(v - vS) = 1. 

If vO is zero and vS is zero, then no shift. But the options don't have a scenario where both are stationary. So perhaps another scenario leads to (vO)/(v - vS) = 1. Wait, perhaps when the source and detector are moving in such a way that their velocities cancel out.

Wait, option E: both moving in opposite directions, source and detector moving away from each other. Wait, in this case, from the perspective of each other, the source and detector are moving towards each other. So if the source is moving away from the stationary detector? Hmm, no, because in this option, both are moving in opposite directions. Let me clarify:

Scenario E: source and detector move in opposite directions, and both are moving away from each other. So if the source is moving in one direction, the detector in the opposite. But perhaps their relative motion is such that the source is moving towards the detector or away. Wait, because if both are moving away from each other, perhaps their relative speed is such that they are moving away from each other. So from the source's perspective, the detector is moving away at a certain speed, and vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps in option G, the source and detector are moving in opposite directions, and the source is moving towards the detector. In that case, the source's speed toward the detector would be vS towards, so the denominator (v - vS) would be v - vS. If the source is moving towards the detector, then vS is positive, so the denominator is v - vS.

Wait, but for Doppler shift, if the source is moving toward the observer, the frequency increases. If the source is moving away, the frequency decreases. The same applies to the detector.

So considering the problem, the correct scenario where there's no shift is when the relative velocities of the source and detector produce a (vO)/(v - vS) ratio of 1. That would mean vO = v - vS.

Wait, another approach: if the source and detector are moving at equal speeds in opposite directions and exactly towards each other, then from the perspective of the source, the detector is moving away, and vice versa. But in that case, the relative motion might not result in a change in perceived frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct case is when the source is moving away at the same speed as the detector is moving towards the source. So vS = vD. Let me think.

Wait, if the source is moving away at speed v, and the detector is moving towards the source at speed v, then from the source's frame, the detector is moving towards it at 2v. That would cause a positive Doppler shift, so no, that scenario wouldn't have no shift.

Wait, perhaps the correct situation is when both are moving in the same direction. Suppose the source is moving away, and the detector is moving away from the source as well. Then from the detector's perspective, the source is moving away, causing a shift. Alternatively, if the source is moving towards the detector, and the detector is moving towards the source, that would cause a shift.

Wait, another thought: if the source is moving away at a speed v, and the detector is moving towards the source at a speed v, then the source's speed is v, the detector's speed is v (but towards the source). So from the source's frame, the detector is moving towards it at speed v, which would cause a Doppler shift. So no shift in that case.

Wait, no, because in that case, the source is moving away, so the denominator in the Doppler formula would have (v - vS), with vS being v, so (v - v) = 0. Then the denominator is zero, so f' tends to infinity? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently.

Another scenario: both source and detector are stationary. Then no Doppler shift. But none of the options seem to have that. So, perhaps the correct scenario is when the source and detector are moving in such a way that their relative motion doesn't create a Doppler effect, i.e., their velocities are such that the observed frequency doesn't change.

Wait, perhaps when both are moving in the same direction, their relative speeds are such that the observed frequency remains the same.

Wait, for example, if they're moving in the same direction, but the source is moving away from the detector. Then, from the detector's perspective, the source is moving away at speed vS. So the Doppler shift would be (v + vO)/(v - vS). Since vO is zero (because the detector is stationary relative to the medium?), and vS is the source's speed. So Doppler shift is (v)/(v - vS). For no shift, v/(v - vS) = 1. So v = v - vS → vS =0. So if the source is stationary. But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps if the source and detector are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is zero, making the Doppler shift zero.

Wait, let's think about a scenario where both are moving in the same direction, but their speeds are equal. So for example, source moving right at speed v, detector moving right at speed v. Then from the detector's frame, the source is moving away at speed 2v because the source is moving at v and the detector at v. Wait, no, that's relative to the stationary frame. So from the stationary frame, the source is moving at v, detector at v, same direction. So from the stationary frame, the source is moving away from the detector at (v -v) = 0. So in that case, the source is stationary relative to the stationary observer, but the source and detector are moving in the same direction at same speed. Wait, but from the detector's perspective, the source is moving away at speed v.

So the relative velocity between source and detector is v (since both are moving at same speed, same direction). So the Doppler formula would be (v + 0)/(v - v) = 1/0 → undefined. But in reality, that's not the case, because if both are moving in same direction and same speed, the source is stationary to the detector. So from the detector's perspective, the source is not moving. So no Doppler shift.

Wait, that makes sense. So in this scenario, both are moving in same direction, same speed. So the source is stationary relative to the detector. So the Doppler effect is zero. So in that case, option C: both moving same direction, same speed. So option C would result in no shift.

Alternatively, another scenario where both are moving in opposite directions. Let's say option E: both moving opposite, but moving away from each other. So from the source's frame, the detector is moving towards it at speed (vS + vD), but wait, this may complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the correct scenario is when the source and detector are moving in opposite directions, and their relative motion causes the source and detector to approach each other, but in a way that their Doppler shift cancels.

Wait, another approach: possible when the source and detector are moving at the same speed but opposite directions, but not necessarily same direction.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option C: both moving same direction. Because if their speeds are same, same direction, then from the detector's frame, the source is moving away at equal speed, so no Doppler shift.

Wait, let me think about it again. If both are moving in same direction at same speed, then from the stationary frame, the source is moving away from the detector at (vS - vD) = 0. So no relative motion. So the source is stationary relative to the detector. So no Doppler shift.

Alternatively, another way: if the source is moving away, and the detector is moving away, but in the same direction. So the source's speed is vS, detector's vD. From the detector's perspective, the source is moving away at (vS) because the source's speed is higher. Wait, no, because from the stationary frame, the source is moving at vS, detector at vD. So if vS = vD, from the stationary frame, the source moves away at (vS - vD) = 0. So the source is stationary relative to the detector. So no Doppler shift.

So in this scenario, option C would result in no shift.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is "both moving same direction." So that would be the correct answer, I think. Because in that case, from the detector's perspective, the source is moving away at the same speed, so the Doppler shift would be (v + 0)/(v - v) = undefined, but in reality, the source is stationary relative to the detector, so the perceived shift is zero. So there's no shift.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the Doppler formula again. The Doppler effect is given by:

f' = f * (v + vO) / (v - vS)

where:
- f' is the observed frequency,
- f is the emitted frequency,
- v is the speed of sound,
- vO is the velocity of the observer relative to the medium (positive when moving towards, negative when moving away),
- vS is the velocity of the source relative to the medium (positive when moving away, negative when moving towards).

For no shift, f' = f → (v + vO)/(v - vS) = 1.

So (v + vO) = (v - vS) → v + vO = v - vS → vO = -vS.

Which means the velocity of the observer (vO) is equal and opposite to the velocity of the source (vS).

So for example, if the source is moving away (vS positive), the observer (detector) is moving towards (vO negative equal to -vS). Or vice versa.

Wait, but in the options, the options don't directly state this. Let's see the options again.

Option C: Both moving same direction. So vS and vD have same direction. So if both are moving, say, right, then vS = vD in the same direction. So from the stationary frame, they're moving in same direction.

In that case, the observed frequency would be (v + vO) / (v - vS). If the source is moving away, vS is positive, so denominator is (v - vS). If vO is zero, then it's v/(v - vS). For no shift, v/(v - vS) = 1 → v = v - vS → vS=0. So source isn't moving.

Wait, but if both are moving same direction, and source is moving away at vS, then the denominator is (v - vS) → but if vO=0, and vS is not zero, then (v)/(v - vS) → which is not 1 unless vS=0. So in that case, the Doppler shift would not be zero.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option.

Option C: Both moving same direction.

If both are moving in same direction, but their speeds are same. So the source is moving away from the detector. Then, from the stationary frame, the source is moving away at speed (vS). Since the detector is also moving at the same speed (vD = vS), then from the stationary frame, the source is moving away from the detector at (vS - vD) = 0. So source is stationary relative to the detector, so no Doppler shift.

Wait, so in that case, the Doppler effect is zero. So option C would result in no shift.

But wait, earlier when I thought of (v + vO) / (v - vS) =1. If the source is moving away, vS is positive, so denominator is (v - vS). But if the source is moving away, and the detector is moving towards source (vO is negative), then vO = -vS → so (v + (-vS)) / (v - vS) = (v - vS)/(v - vS) = 1. So that would result in no shift.

Ah, so that's another scenario. So if the source is moving away and the detector is moving towards at the same speed, the Doppler effect cancels out. So f' = f.

So in that case, what's the scenario? The source and detector are moving in opposite directions. The source is moving away, the detector is moving towards. So their speeds are same, but opposite directions.

Looking back at the options, option G is "The source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source moving towards the detector." So that's the opposite direction scenario.

Wait, but in that case, (vO) would be negative (since the detector is moving towards, so vO is negative) and vS is positive (source moving away). So vO = -vS. So (v + vO) = v - vS. (v - vS) is the denominator. So (v -vS)/(v -vS) = 1.

So in this scenario, the Doppler shift is zero. So this would mean that when the source and detector are moving in opposite directions at the same speed, the Doppler effect cancels out. So the no shift occurs.

Looking back at the options, option G is "The source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source moving towards the detector."

So that's exactly that scenario. So when the source is moving towards the detector and the detector is moving away, the relative motion causes no shift.

But wait, I thought earlier that if both are moving same direction, and their speeds are same, then the source is moving away, so no shift. So which option is that? Option C says "Both moving same direction." So if that's the case, then option C would result in no Doppler shift.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought. So which one is correct?

The options are:

Option G: Source and detector move in opposite directions, source moving towards.

So according to the Doppler formula, if vO = -vS (because source is moving towards, so vO is negative; detector is moving away, so vO is positive?), wait no: no, wait. For Doppler shift, vO is the velocity of the observer. If the observer is moving towards the source, then vO is positive. If moving away, negative.

Similarly, vS is the velocity of the source. If source is moving away, vS is positive; moving towards, vS is negative.

So in option G, the source and detector are moving in opposite directions. So if source is moving towards, then detector is moving away. So, source's velocity is positive, detector's is negative, but their magnitudes are same. So vS = positive, vD = negative, but |vS| = |vD|.

So, from the Doppler formula, (v + vO)/(v - vS). Suppose vO is negative (since the detector is moving away), and vS is positive. So:

v + vO = v - vS.

Denominator: v - vS.

So the ratio (v - vS)/(v - vS) = 1. So no shift.

So option G would result in no shift.

Wait, but the question is to find which situation results in no shift. So the correct answer is option G.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option G is described as "The source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source moving towards the detector." So that's exactly the scenario where the Doppler effect cancels out.

So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but in option C, both moving same direction, same speed. So the source is moving away, so no shift. So option C is also a scenario where the Doppler shift is zero.

So now I'm confused. Because both options C and G could result in no shift. But wait, option G is when the source and detector are moving in opposite directions (so, for example, source moving towards, detector moving away), but with vS = vD.

In that case, if their speeds are same and opposite directions, then vS = vD (magnitude same, direction opposite). So from the Doppler formula, the observed frequency would be (v + vO)/(v - vS). But in this scenario, the source is moving towards, so vO is negative. So (v + (-vS))/(v - vS) → [v - vS]/[v - vS] → 1. So no shift.

So both options C and G could result in no shift. But wait, looking at the options again, perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: Both rotate around a common axis.

B: source moving toward stationary detector.

C: both moving same direction.

D: source moving away from stationary detector.

E: both moving opposite, source and detector moving away.

F: source moving toward stationary detector.

G: source and detector move in opposite directions, source moving towards.

H: detector moving away from source.

So, in option C, both moving same direction, same speed. Source is moving away, so no shift.

Option G: source and detector moving in opposite directions, source moving towards. So in this case, the source is moving towards, detector moving away, same speed. So from the Doppler formula, (v + vO)/(v - vS) → (v + (-v)) / (v - v) → 0/0, which is undefined, but in reality, the source is stationary relative to the detector, so no shift.

So both options C and G would result in no shift.

Wait, but the question is from the options given, which one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, because in that case, the source is moving away, and the detector is stationary relative to the source.

Wait, but in option C, both are moving same direction, same speed. So from the stationary frame, the source is moving away at speed v, and the detector is moving away at speed v. So from the stationary frame, the source and detector are moving away at same speed. So the source is moving away, so relative to the detector, the source is moving away at speed v. So the Doppler effect is (v + 0)/(v - v) → undefined. But in reality, since the source and detector are moving away at same speed, they are stationary relative to each other, so no shift.

Wait, that's correct. So option C would result in no shift.

On the other hand, option G is a different scenario. So perhaps the question is expecting the correct answer to be option C.

Wait, but let me think of it again. If both are moving same direction, same speed, then the source is moving away from the detector, so the Doppler effect is (v + 0)/(v - v) → 1/0, which is undefined, but in reality, the source and detector are stationary relative to each other, so no shift.

So in that case, option C would indeed result in no shift.

So, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but another thought. If both are moving same direction, same speed, the source is moving away from the detector, so the Doppler effect is (v + 0)/(v - v) → 1/0 → undefined. But in reality, the source and detector are stationary relative to each other, so no shift.

Therefore, option C is correct.

So, after all that, the correct answer is option C.
</think>

To determine when there is no perceived Doppler shift, we analyze the Doppler formula:

\[
f' = f \cdot \frac{v + v_O}{v - v_S}
\]

For no shift (\(f' = f\)), the condition is:

\[
\frac{v + v_O}{v - v_S} = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v + v_O = v - v_S \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_O = -v_S
\]

This means the observer's velocity (\(v_O\)) is the negative of the source's velocity (\(v_S\)), indicating opposite directions.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option C: Both moving same direction.**  
   If both are moving in the same direction but at the same speed, the source is moving away from the detector. Thus, \(v_O = -v_S\) (since \(v_O\) is negative for the source, and \(v_S\) is positive for the detector). This satisfies the condition for no shift.  

2. **Option G: Source and detector move in opposite directions, with the source moving towards the detector.**  
   In this scenario, \(v_S\) (source speed) is positive, and \(v_O\) (observer speed) is negative (since the detector is moving away). The condition \(v_O = -v_S\) is met, leading to no shift.  

3. **Option C is correct** because it directly satisfies the condition for no shift by having opposite directions with equal speeds.  

ANSWER: C
