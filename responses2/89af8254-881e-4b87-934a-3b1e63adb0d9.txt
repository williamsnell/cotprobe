Okay, so I have this question about break-even points. Let me try to figure it out. Break-even point is when the cost equals the revenue, right? So I need to find x where C equals R for each option.

Starting with part (a): C is $10x + $600 and R is $30x. So I set them equal: 10x + 600 = 30x. Subtract 10x from both sides: 600 = 20x. Then x is 600/20, which is 30 units. Hmm, wait, but looking at the options, let me check all the answers. Oh, option A says 32, which doesn't match. Did I do that right? Let me double-check. 10*30 is 300 +600=900. 30*30 is 900. So yes, correct. But let me see all the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see all the options provided. Wait, option A says 32 units. So my calculation gives 30, but the options don't have that. Hmm, did I miscalculate?

Wait, maybe I did miscalculate. Let's redo equation (a): 10x + 600 = 30x. Subtract 10x: 600 = 20x. x=30. So the correct break-even is 30 units. But in the options, the first number for part (a) is 32 units. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the cost as 10 dollars per unit plus fixed cost of 600. So yes, C is 10x +600, R is 30x. So break-even at x=30. But the options don't have 30. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me check the question again.

Oh wait, the question lists four parts, each with options. Let me check each part.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each part correctly.

(a) C =10x +600, R=30x. So 10x +600 = 30x → 600 =20x → x=30. So the first part's break-even is 30 units. Looking at the options, I don't see 30 in the first part. The options are A to J, each with four numbers.

Wait, looking at option F: the first number is 35 units. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me double-check each option.

Looking at the options:

A: 32, 72, 480, 4 4/7 units.

B:40,70,600,5.

C:45,80,650,6.

D:50,62.5,700,7 1/7.

E:55,85,750,6 3/7.

F:35,75,550,5 2/7.

G:20,60,400,3.

H:28,68,525,4.

I:30,66.666...,500,4 2/7.

J:25,64,450,3 3/7.

Wait, part (a) is 30 units. Looking at the options, option I's first number is 30. Oh, but wait. Option I's first number is 30, but the other numbers don't match. Let me check the other parts.

But wait, the question asks for the break-even point for each of the following, so each part is a separate calculation. So for part (a), the break-even is 30. But looking at all options, only option I's first number is 30. Let me check part (a) of option I.

Option I: 30 units, 66 2/3, 500, 4 2/7. So yes, 30 is the first number. But what about the other parts?

Wait, but maybe I've made a mistake. Let me check each part.

(a) C =10x +600, R=30x. Break-even is 30 units. So the first number is 30.

(b) C=5x +200, R=8x. So 5x +200 =8x → 200=3x → x=200/3 ≈66.666... which is 66 2/3. So part (b) is 66.666...

(c) C=0.2x +50, R=0.3x. So 0.2x +50 =0.3x →50=0.1x →x=500. So part (c) is 500.

(d) C=1800x +3000, R=2500x. So 1800x +3000 =2500x →3000=700x →x=3000/700=300/70=30/7≈4.2857, which is 4 2/7.

So the four break-even points are:

(a) 30

(b) 66 2/3

(c)500

(d)4 2/7.

Now, looking at the options:

Option I has the first number as 30, second as 66 2/3, third as 500, fourth as 4 2/7. So that's exactly what I calculated. So the correct option is I.

The correct answer is calculated by finding the break-even point for each part by setting cost equal to revenue and solving for \( x \). Here are the detailed calculations:

(a) \( C = 10x + 600 \), \( R = 30x \):
\[
10x + 600 = 30x \implies 600 = 20x \implies x = 30 \text{ units}
\]

(b) \( C = 5x + 200 \), \( R = 8x \):
\[
5x + 200 = 8x \implies 200 = 3x \implies x = \frac{200}{3} = 66 \frac{2}{3} \text{ units}
\]

(c) \( C = 0.2x + 50 \), \( R = 0.3x \):
\[
0.2x + 50 = 0.3x \implies 50 = 0.1x \implies x = 500 \text{ units}
\]

(d) \( C = 1800x + 3000 \), \( R = 2500x \):
\[
1800x + 3000 = 2500x \implies 3000 = 700x \implies x = \frac{3000}{700} = \frac{30}{7} = 4 \frac{2}{7} \text{ units}
\]

The break-even points are:
- (a) 30 units
- (b) \( 66 \frac{2}{3} \) units
- (c) 500 units
- (d) \( 4 \frac{2}{7} \) units

Matching these with the options, the correct choice is **Option I**.

**ANSWER: I**
