Okay, so I have this question about the speed of data transmission in a 4G network. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my networking, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that 4G networks use 5G technology, but wait, no, 4G is part of the 5G family. Oh wait, no, 5G is the latest, so 4G uses the same technology. But what's the typical speed?

I think about the different data speeds. I recall that 1 Gbps is 1,000 megabits per second. That's pretty fast. So, for 4G, the speeds are usually higher than 1 Gbps because it's a faster network, right? I remember some examples: 10 Gbps is common for 5G networks. Wait, but 4G was introduced before 5G, so maybe it's lower? Or maybe the same?

Wait, no. 5G networks usually have higher speeds than 4G. So, 10 Gbps would be for 5G, but 4G might be up to maybe 10 Gbps? Or is it lower? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently. I think 10 Gbps is the typical speed for 5G, but 4G can go up to maybe 10 Gbps as well. So, looking at the options, option A is 10-100 Gbps. That sounds right.

Alternatively, 4G might not go that high. Wait, wait, no, I think 4G supports up to 10 Gbps, but 5G is higher. So option A, which is 10-100 Gbps, would be the correct range for a 4G network.

Let me look at the other options to make sure. Option E is 386 kbps to 2 mbps. That's way too low, definitely not 4G. Option B is 50-500 mbps. That's about 50 mbps, which is lower than typical 4G, which I think starts at 100 mbps or higher. Option C is 2-1 Gbps. Hmm, 2 mbps seems low, but 1 Gbps is 1000 mbps. So that's 2-1000 mbps. That's a huge range, but 4G might not go that high. Option D is 100-1 Gbps. That's 100 mbps to 1000 mbps, which seems plausible for 4G. Option J is 500 kbps to 1.5 mbps. That's 0.5 to 1.5 mbps—way too slow. So, the other options don't fit. Option I is 10-100 mbps, which is 10mbps to 100mbps. That's a 90% range, but 4G might have higher speeds. Option F is 2mbps, which is way too low. Option G is 1-10 mbps, which is even lower. Option H is 1-10 Gbps, which is a much broader range and probably incorrect because 4G is lower. 

So, the correct option must be A:10-100 Gbps. Because 4G can go up to 10 Gbps, and that's covered in option A. The other options either have lower speeds or don't fit the typical range of a 4G network.

The correct answer is A: 10–100 Gbps. This range is typical for 4G networks, as they can support speeds up to 10 Gbps.
