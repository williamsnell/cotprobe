Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the characteristics of a programmed decision. Let's start by breaking down the question. The question is about what defines a programmed decision. The options are A to J, each describing different characteristics related to risk, routine, complexity, etc.

First, I should recall what I know about programmed decisions. From what I remember, programmed decisions are those that follow a set of rules or algorithms. They're often made in a routine manner because they're part of a predictable process. So, I think programmed decisions are not random or non-routine. That would rule out options B and E, which say "non-routine and complex" and "uncertain and non-routine" respectively. Wait, no, wait. Option E says uncertain and non-routine. Hmm, but I thought programmed decisions are routine. So perhaps option E is incorrect.

Option A says uncertain and low risk. I'm not sure about this. Programmed decisions are usually predictable, so they're not uncertain. So A might not be correct.

Option C is low risk and certain. Wait, programmed decisions are usually certain because they follow a set of steps. So if they're programmed, they're certain, but they might have low risk because there's no uncertainty. So C might be correct.

Option D says high risk and uncertain. No, that's the opposite. High risk would imply that the decision is risky, but programmed decisions are generally not risky because they're predictable.

Option F: Risky and routine. No, because programmed decisions are routine, not risky.

Option G: Complex and risky. No, that's not right because they're not complex or risky.

Option I: Complex and certain. Programmed decisions are not complex, so I is out.

Option J: Routine and non-complex. Wait, 'non-complex' doesn't make sense. The term 'complex' is often used to describe something difficult or intricate. So maybe 'non-complex' is incorrect. So J is wrong.

Option H: Certain and complex. Programmed decisions are not complex; they're straightforward. So H is incorrect.

Option A was uncertain and low risk. I'm not sure about that because I thought programmed decisions are certain. So A is probably wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Programmed decision-making involves a structured process where the decision is based on predefined rules or algorithms. So the decision is routine and doesn't have high uncertainty. Therefore, the characteristics should be something like routine and not uncertain. Looking at the options, option E says uncertain and non-routine. That's the opposite of what I was thinking.

So the characteristics of a programmed decision should be routine and not uncertain. Looking at the options, option E is uncertain and non-routine, which is not right. So perhaps option C is correct because it's low risk and certain, which aligns with the idea that programmed decisions are certain and have low risk.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think of an example. Like, when a company follows a set of procedures, the decisions made are based on the program. So they're routine, certain, and low in risk.

So the characteristics would be low risk and certain. That's option C.

Alternatively, I've heard that decision-making can be routine (so E is non-routine) or structured (C). So I'm leaning towards option C. But wait, another angle: what's the term for a programmed decision? I think it's called a routine decision, but sometimes they can be complex.

Wait, another point: programmed decisions are often routine (so not non-routine, so B is out). They are not necessarily uncertain; they are more about following a set process. So the correct combination would be something like routine and certain, but none of the options say that exactly.

Looking again, option C is low risk and certain. So that fits. Because the decision is certain because it's based on a program, and it's low risk because there's no uncertainty involved.

Wait, but some decisions might be complex. Like, if you have to choose between multiple factors, but that's more about the process rather than the decision itself. So the decision is routine, so it's not complex. So the characteristics are low risk (since there's no risk of uncertainty) and certain (no risk of error or uncertainty).

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, decisions can be non routine but structured, but I think the term 'programmed' implies that the decision is based on a set of rules, making it routine.

So putting it all together, the characteristics are low risk and certain, which is option C.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is about characteristics, not the process. So programmed decisions are routine and not uncertain. So the characteristics are that they are routine and not uncertain. So the options that fit would be something like routine and certain.

Looking at the options, option C is low risk and certain. So that fits. Because if it's certain, there's no risk, so low risk is correct. So the answer is C.

The characteristics of a programmed decision are routine and not uncertain. 

Programmed decisions follow a structured process, making them routine and not uncertain. They are certain, as they are based on predefined rules or algorithms. 

Analyzing the options, option C (low risk and certain) fits because programmed decisions are certain (no risk) and have low risk (since there's no uncertainty involved).
