Okay, so I've got this combinatorics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is asking: How many ways can a committee of 2 men and 3 women be selected from a group of 6 men and 8 women?

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with combinations, the formula is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n-k)!)). So I think I need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 men from 6 and 3 women from 8.

Let me write that down. For the men: 6 choose 2. And for the women: 8 choose 3. Then I multiply those two numbers together because for each way of choosing the men, there are that many ways to choose the women.

Calculating 6 choose 2: 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15. Right, because 6*5 is 30, divided by 2 is 15.

Now for the women: 8 choose 3. Let's see, 8!/(3!*(8-3)!) = (8*7*6)/(3*2*1) = (336)/(6) = 56. Wait, no, 8*7 is 56, 56*6 is 336. Divided by 6 gives 56.

So now I multiply the two numbers: 15 * 56. Let me do that. 15 times 50 is 750, and 15 times 6 is 90. So 750 + 90 is 840.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 840. So that's the answer? But wait, am I sure about the multiplication? Let me double-check. 15 * 56: 15*50=750, 15*6=90; 750 +90=840. Yep, that seems right.

So the correct answer should be 840, which is option I. Let me cross-check the options again. The options are A:1500, B:1000, C:1200, D:1100, E:720, F:960, G:400, H:500, I:840, J:650. Yep, I is 840. So I think the correct answer is I.

The number of ways to select 2 men from 6 is 15, and 3 women from 8 is 56. Multiplying these gives 15 * 56 = 840.

**Answer: I: 840**
