Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy loss of particles in air. Let's see... I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking for the approximate energy-loss rate of 3MeV alpha particles in air, given that the mean energy-loss rate of 3MeV protons in air is 12.5 × 10^-2 MeV/cm. The options are labeled from A to J, each with a different value.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the energy loss of charged particles as they pass through matter is related to their charge and the material they're passing through. I think the energy loss (or stopping power) is generally higher for heavier particles because they interact more strongly with the medium. But wait, let me think about the specifics.

Protons are positively charged particles, and alpha particles are also positively charged but much heavier. So, the stopping power should be higher for alpha particles than for protons. But how does that scaling work? I think there's an equation or a formula that relates the stopping power to the charge, mass, and density of the material.

Oh right, the Bethe formula. Wait, the Bethe formula gives the stopping power as a function of the particle's kinetic energy. The formula is something like:

W = ( (Z e^2)/(2 m v^2) ) * (1 + (something with the particle's gamma and the material's density))

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the stopping power is proportional to (Z^2 * e^2)/(m * v^2) multiplied by a factor that depends on the particle's energy and the material's properties.

Another approach is to recall that the stopping power is proportional to (Z^2)/(A), where A is the mass number of the particle, assuming that the material's properties (like density) are similar. Because heavier particles (higher A) have higher stopping power.

So for the same energy, the stopping power for an alpha particle versus a proton should depend on the ratio of their masses. Let me think: the mass of a proton is about 1 GeV/c², but wait, no, the mass in terms of mass number for protons is 1. For an alpha particle, the mass is about 4 units (since 4 protons make an alpha). So the stopping power should be roughly (m_p/m_alpha) * something.

Wait, the stopping power is inversely proportional to the mass. So if a proton has a stopping power of 12.5e-2 MeV/cm, then an alpha particle should have a lower stopping power because it's heavier. Let me think about the actual ratio.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 1.007 atomic mass units (u), and the mass of an alpha particle is about 4.002 u. So the ratio of their masses is roughly 1 : 4.002/1.007 ≈ 1:4. So the stopping power for alpha should be about a quarter of that of a proton, assuming same energy.

Wait, but wait, the given stopping power for protons is 12.5e-2 MeV/cm. So if alpha particles have a stopping power about a quarter of that, then 12.5e-2 / 4 = 3.125e-2 MeV/cm. But looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are in the 0.5, 1, 2, etc. scale.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the factors. Let me think again. The stopping power (W) is given by the formula:

W = (Z^2 * e^2 * σ * N_A * n) / (2 * m * v^2)

Wait, but for a given density, σ (the cross-section) is roughly proportional to the atomic number Z squared divided by mass number A. So for two particles, same Z, different A.

Alternatively, the stopping power is proportional to (Z^2)/(A) for a given particle. So for a proton, which has A=1, compared to an alpha (A=4), the stopping power would be (Z^2/(A_p)) / (Z^2/(A_alpha)) ) = (A_alpha / A_p) ) = 4. So a proton's stopping power is four times that of a heavier particle, assuming same Z and same density, same energy.

Wait, but the question states that the energy loss rate for protons is given as 12.5e-2 MeV/cm. So if alpha's stopping power is (A_p)/(A_alpha) times that of protons, then it would be (1/4) of 12.5e-2 MeV/cm. So 12.5e-2 /4 = 3.125e-2. But the options don't have that. The closest would be something around 1 MeV/cm, but wait, the options are A (2), B (1), C (0.5), D (0.05), etc.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the assumption about the formula. Another approach: the mean free path or stopping power per unit mass.

Wait, perhaps the stopping power per unit mass is proportional to Z^2/(A m_e c^2), but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think of it in terms of the Bethe formula.

The Bethe formula for the stopping power (power per unit mass) is given by:

W = ( (Z e^2) / (2 m c^2) ) * (1/(1 + (Z e^2)/(2 m v^2 c^2))) ) * (1/(1 + (σ T)/(2 m v^2 c^2)))

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the stopping power for a charged particle is given by:

W = ( (Z^2 e^4) ) / (2 m v^2 c^2) * (1 / (1 + (Z^2 e^4)/(2 m v^2 c^2) * σ )) ) * (1/(1 + (σ T)/(2 m v^2 c^2) ))

But perhaps I can consider that the stopping power scales as (Z^2)/(A) times a density-dependent term.

Wait, another approach: the energy loss rate (W) is given by (Z^2)/(A) * (some constant) * (density). So, for two particles with the same energy, the one with lower A (alpha) would have a lower stopping power.

Let me think of the ratio between the stopping power of alpha and proton. Suppose the stopping power for a proton is W_p and for an alpha is W_alpha. Then, W_alpha = k * (Z_alpha^2)/(A_alpha) / (Z_p^2/(A_p)) * W_p.

Assuming same density and same velocity. Since Z_alpha = Z_p = 2, so their ratio is 4/4 = 1. So W_alpha = (4/4) * W_p = W_p. Wait, that can't be right because I know that the alpha's stopping power is higher for the same energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the variables. Let me re-examine the formula.

The stopping power W is given by:

W = ( (Z e^2) ) / (2 m v^2) * (1/(1 + (Z e^2)/(2 m v^2)) ) * ( density )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the key factor is that the stopping power for a particle is proportional to Z^2/(A), for the same velocity and density.

So, for the same energy, the alpha has higher Z (Z=2) compared to proton (Z=1), but also a higher A (4 vs 1). So the ratio would be (Z_alpha / Z_proton)^2 / (A_alpha / A_proton) = (2/1)^2 / (4/1) = 4/4 = 1. So no change? But that can't be right because I know that the alpha's stopping power is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that Z is the same. Oh wait, both protons and alpha particles are positively charged, so Z is 2 for alpha and 1 for proton. So the ratio would be 2^2 /4 = 4/4=1. So same ratio, but that would imply same stopping power, which I know isn't the case.

Ah, maybe the formula is different. Another approach: the stopping power W is given by:

W = (Z² e²)/(2 m c²) * (n σ) * (1/(v²)) where σ is the cross-section and n is the number density.

The cross-section σ is proportional to (Z²)/(A) * (something else). So for two particles, the ratio of their stopping power is (Z_alpha^2 / A_alpha) / (Z_proton^2 / A_proton) ) * (n_alpha σ_alpha / (n_proton σ_proton)) ) * (1/v_alpha² / (1/v_proton²)) )

But for the same energy, v is the same (since energy is (1/2) m v², so same for same velocity), so the velocity term is 1.

Wait, but if the number density is the same, then the ratio would just be (Z_alpha^2 / A_alpha) / (Z_proton^2 / A_proton) )

Which is ( (2)^2 /4 ) / ( (1)^2 /1 ) ) = (4/4) / (1/1 ) = 1. So again, same ratio, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the stopping power also depends on the energy. Because as energy increases, the stopping power increases for a given particle. So maybe I should consider that for the same energy, the stopping power is higher for heavier particles.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (Z_alpha² / A_alpha ) / ( Z_proton² / A_proton ) ) times the ratio of their energies. But the question says the energy loss rate for protons is 12.5e-2 MeV/cm, and we need to find for alphas. So the energy is higher, so the stopping power would be higher.

Wait, but the problem states: "the mean energy-loss rate of 3MeV protons is 12.5e-2 MeV/cm." So for the same energy, the alpha's would have a higher rate. But in this problem, perhaps the context is that the energy is the same. Because the given data is for protons, so perhaps the alpha's are being considered with same energy.

Wait, but the question is asking for the energy loss rate of 3MeV alphas. The given data is for 3MeV protons. So perhaps the energy is the same, so the alpha's would have higher W.

So let me proceed under that assumption. The stopping power for the alpha would be ( (Z_alpha^2)/(A_alpha) ) / ( (Z_proton^2)/(A_proton) ) ) * W_p.

Wait, Z_alpha = 2, A_alpha=4, Z_proton=1, A_proton=1. So (4)/(4) divided by (1)/(1) = 1. So same ratio. That can't be right, as I know that alpha particles have higher stopping power than protons.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Cross-section formula. The cross-section sigma is proportional to (Z^2)/(A) * (other terms). So for same energy, the same v, same density, the ratio of cross-sections is (Z_alpha^2)/(A_alpha) / (Z_proton^2)/(A_proton) ) = (4)/(4) = 1. So stopping power for same v would be same, but that's not right. Hence, perhaps I'm missing a factor that involves the velocity or something else.

Wait, another approach: the stopping power W is given by:

W = ( (Z e^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * (1 + (Z e^2)/(2 m v^2 c^2) )^{-1} * (1 + (σ T)/(2 m v^2 c^2) )^{-1} * (n) )

But this is getting too complex. Maybe I should look for a simpler relation. Since the stopping power is inversely proportional to the product of mass and velocity squared. Or perhaps it's directly proportional to (Z^2)/(A) times the density.

Wait, I think I remember that for the same energy, the alpha's stopping power is about (A_p / A_alpha) times that of the proton. So A_p is 1, A_alpha is 4. So 1/4: that's 0.25. So 0.25 times 12.5e-2 MeV/cm is 3.125e-2 MeV/cm. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options don't include that. The closest are option B (1e-2) and C (0.5e-2). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering mean energy loss rate per particle, not per mass. So, perhaps the stopping power per particle is higher for alpha than proton. But I thought that the given W_p is per mass. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the stopping power scales as (Z^2)/(A) for the same energy and same density. So for the same energy, the alpha has (2^2)/(4) = 1, the proton has (1^2)/(1) = 1. So same, but I know that's not correct, because the alpha's should have higher stopping power for same energy.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is wrong. Maybe the mean energy loss rate is higher for alpha than proton. So if the given W_p is 12.5e-2 MeV/cm (per proton mass?), then the alpha's W_alpha is ( (2^2)/(4) ) / (1^2/1) ) * W_p = (4/4)/(1) ) *12.5e-2 → 1 * 12.5e-2 → still 12.5e-2. So that would mean same as protons, which is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the stopping power is inversely proportional to the mass. So W_alpha = W_p * (A_p / A_alpha) ) → 12.5e-2 * (1/4) → 3.125e-2, but this is not in the options.

Wait, but the question is about the energy loss rate of 3MeV alpha particles, not per unit mass. So perhaps there's a different scaling.

Wait, another formula: the energy loss rate (W) is given by:

W = ( (Z^2 e^4) )/(2 m^2 v^2 c^2) ) * (1/(1 + (Z^2 e^4)/(2 m^2 v^2 c^2) )) ) * (1/(1 + (σ T)/(2 m v^2 c^2) )) * (n)

But perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the energy loss rate is proportional to (Z^2)/(A) * density. So for same density, W_alpha = (Z_alpha^2 / A_alpha) / (Z_proton^2 / A_proton) ) * W_p = (4/4)/(1/1) * W_p = W_p → same, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem gives that the energy loss rate of 3MeV protons is 12.5e-2 MeV/cm. I'll have to find the same for 3MeV alpha particles.

Assuming that the stopping power is proportional to (Z^2)/(A) * (some other factor that depends on the density). So for the same energy, the alpha's stopping power would be ( (Z_alpha^2)/(A_alpha) ) / ( (Z_proton^2)/A_proton ) ) * W_p.

So Z_alpha = 2, A_alpha=4. Z_p=1, A_p=1.

Ratio = ( (2)^2 /4 ) / ( (1)^2 /1 ) ) → (4/4)/(1) → 1/1 → 1. So same ratio. Thus, same stopping power. But that would mean W_alpha = W_p = 12.5e-2 MeV/cm. But I know that's not right. So perhaps the question isn't considering the same energy, but the same velocity.

Wait, if the alpha and proton have the same velocity, then their stopping power would depend only on their mass and charge. Then, since mass of alpha is 4, stopping power would be lower by a factor of 4. So W_alpha = W_p /4 → 12.5e-2 /4 = 3.125e-2 MeV/cm. But this is not one of the options.

Hmm, but the options given don't have 3.1e-2. The closest is 1e-2 (option B) and 2e-2 (option A). So perhaps the assumption is wrong that the stopping power scales as (Z^2)/(A).

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem expects a certain scaling, like the alpha's stopping power is about 1/3 of the proton's, but I can't recall.

Wait, another thought: The energy loss per unit mass for protons is 12.5e-2 MeV/cm. So the same for alpha particles, but their mass is 4 times that of the proton. So the energy loss per unit mass would be 12.5e-2 MeV/cm divided by 4 → 3.125e-2. But that again would lead to the same result, which isn't an option.

Wait, but perhaps the question is looking for the same energy loss rate, but for the same velocity. So if the proton and alpha have the same velocity, the alpha would have a lower stopping power by a factor of 4. So 12.5e-2 /4 = 3.125e-2. But again, not an option.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the concept of the "interaction length" which is inversely proportional to the product of mass and velocity. Let me think.

The interaction length (or stopping length) is given by L = (Z e^2)/(2 m v^2) * (1/(1 + ... )) * (1/(1 + ... )) * n.

Assuming the same n (density), same Z, same v (same velocity), the stopping length (L) would be proportional to (Z^2)/(A). So for protons, A=1. For alpha, A=4. So L_alpha = (Z^2/A) * L_p → (4/4) * L_p → L_p. Wait, that can't be right because alpha should have higher L.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to think of the stopping power as proportional to (Z^2)/(A). So for the same energy, the alpha's stopping power is (2^2)/(4) = 1, same as the proton. That can't be right, because I know the alpha has higher stopping power for same energy.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the A and just use a factor of 1/3, but my initial thought was that the stopping power for alpha is higher.

Wait, another approach: Let me think of the ratio of their stopping powers. The stopping power (W) is inversely proportional to the mass. Since the alpha's mass is 4, the stopping power would be 1/4 that of the proton for the same velocity. So W_alpha = W_p /4. Then, 12.5e-2 /4 = 3.125e-2. But none of the options is that.

The options are 2e-2, 1e-2, 0.5e-2, 4e-2.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the same energy. Maybe the problem is simply saying that 3MeV protons lose 12.5e-2 MeV/cm, and 3MeV alphas lose a certain amount. So the question is about the same energy, so the alpha's stopping power is lower by a factor of 4, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same density, but the stopping power is proportional to mass. So, since alpha is 4 times more massive than proton, the stopping power would be 4 times higher. So W_alpha=4 * W_p=4 * 12.5e-2=50e-2 MeV/cm, which is 0.5 MeV/cm. That's option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the stopping power for alpha should be higher for same energy. But according to this, since alpha is 4 times heavier, it would have 4 times higher W. So 4 * 12.5e-2 = 50e-2 = 0.5 MeV/cm. Option C.

Ah, that makes sense. So the stopping power increases with mass, so the alpha's would have 4 times higher W than the proton's. So the correct answer is option C (0.5 MeV/cm).
</think>

The problem involves determining the energy loss rate (stopping power) for 3 MeV alpha particles, given that the energy loss rate for 3 MeV protons is 12.5 × 10⁻² MeV/cm. The key assumption is that the stopping power is proportional to the mass of the particle, as heavier particles generally experience greater energy loss for the same velocity.

### Analysis:
1. **Stopping Power and Mass Relation**:  
   The stopping power (energy loss per unit mass) is proportional to the mass of the particle. For two particles with the same velocity, the stopping power is inversely proportional to their masses. Thus, for an alpha particle (mass = 4) compared to a proton (mass = 1), the stopping power is 4 times greater.

2. **Scaling the Stopping Power**:  
   Given the stopping power for protons is 12.5 × 10⁻² MeV/cm, the stopping power for alpha particles would be:  
   \[
   W_{\text{alpha}} = 4 \times W_{\text{proton}} = 4 \times 12.5 \times 10^{-2} = 50 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{MeV/cm} = 0.5 \, \text{MeV/cm}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated stopping power for alpha particles is 0.5 MeV/cm, which corresponds to option **C**.

### Conclusion:
The energy loss rate for 3 MeV alpha particles is 0.5 MeV/cm, based on the assumption that the stopping power is proportional to the mass of the particle.
