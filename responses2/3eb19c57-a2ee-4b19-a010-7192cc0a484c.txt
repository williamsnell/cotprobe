Okay, I need to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a charge of 1 Coulomb flowing from a 100-V outlet through a 100-W light bulb each second. They're asking how much work is done each second by this electrical source. The options are from A to J, each with a different value.

Hmm, I remember that electrical work is related to voltage and charge. Oh right, work done (W) is equal to voltage (V) multiplied by charge (Q). The formula is W = Q * V. 

Let me plug in the numbers. The voltage is 100 Volts and the charge is 1 Coulomb per second. So each second, 1 C flows, so W = 1 C * 100 V. That would be 100 joules per second, which is 100 joules. So the answer would be option A, which is 100 joules.

Wait, but wait. Sometimes when dealing with current and power, I remember that power is related to current and voltage. Oh yeah, power (P) equals current (I) multiplied by voltage (V), P = I * V. The power is given as 100 W, which is 100 J/s, so that matches the 100 J per second. So that makes sense.

Another way to think about it: each second, 1 Coulomb of charge passes through the light bulb, and the voltage is 100 V. So the work done is 100 J. So the answer should be A.

To determine the work done each second by the electrical source, we use the formula:

\[
W = Q \cdot V
\]

Where:
- \( Q = 1 \, \text{C} \) (charge per second),
- \( V = 100 \, \text{V} \) (voltage).

Substituting the values:

\[
W = 1 \cdot 100 = 100 \, \text{Joules}
\]

Thus, the work done each second is **100 joules**. The correct answer is **A: 100 joules**.
