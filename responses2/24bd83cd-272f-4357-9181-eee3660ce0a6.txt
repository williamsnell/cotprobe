Question:

Hydrangea flowers have one gene for flower color. Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?

Options:

A: The flower color is a result of genetic drift within the population.
B: In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.
C: The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.
D: The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.
E: The flower color is a result of multiple alleles interacting.
F: The flower color is a result of the plant's age.
G: The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.
H: The flower color is determined by the type of pollinators in the area.
I: The flower color is determined by the amount of sunlight the plant receives.
J: The flower color changes due to genetic mutation over time.

Okay, so I have this question about hydrangea flowers and their flower color. Hmm, hydrangeas have different colors like blue and pink, and it's because of the type of soil they grow in. The question is asking which statement best explains why the color varies.

Let me look at the options. The question is about inheritance and why color changes. So each option is a possible explanation.

Option A: The flower color is a result of genetic drift within the population. Drift usually refers to random changes in allele frequencies. But wait, genetic drift is more about random mutations and gene flow in populations, not about environmental factors affecting phenotypes. I'm not sure if that's the main reason here. The color is more influenced by environment, like soil. So probably not A.

Option B: The environment alters the expression of a trait. Oh, right. So plants grow in different environments, which affects how their genes are expressed. So the color change is because the environment (soil) affects how the alleles are expressed. That makes sense. So B could be correct.

Option C: Polygenic inheritance. Polygenic means multiple genes contribute to a single trait. But hydrangeas have one gene for flower color. So each plant has one dominant or recessive allele. I don't think that's the case here. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: Codominant alleles. Codominance is when both traits are expressed together, and the effect is more than either trait alone. But why is that the case here? The color varies because the soil is different, but I don't think the alleles are codominant. So D might not be right.

Option E: The color is determined by multiple alleles. Well, since it's just one gene, each plant has one allele. So E is not the right term. Each plant has one, so they can only be one color. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The color is a result of the plantâ€™s age. I don't think the age affects flower color. Older plants might have less coloration, but the color is determined by the gene, not the age. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Incomplete dominance. Incomplete dominance is when both alleles are expressed, but neither is dominant. Like in some flowers where a plant can show both traits. But in hydrangeas, each plant has one dominant allele and one recessive. So G is not the case.

Option H: Determined by pollinators. Pollination affects the flower's reproduction, but not the coloration. So H is unrelated.

Option I: Determined by sunlight. I don't think the amount of sunlight affects flower color. It's more about growth rate and pollination, not color.

Option J: Determined by genetic mutation. Mutations are random changes, but that doesn't explain why the same plant is different. The variation comes from environment, not mutations. So J is not correct.

So, putting it together: The best explanation is that the environment (soil) affects the expression of the trait. So option B is correct.

The question asks why hydrangea flowers vary in color due to soil, and the options explore possible explanations. 

- **Option A** suggests genetic drift, which is more about population genetics and random changes. It doesn't explain the soil-based variation in color.
- **Option B** states that the environment alters trait expression. This aligns with the idea that soil conditions affect how alleles are expressed.
- **Option C** refers to polygenic inheritance, which applies when multiple genes contribute to a trait, not the case here with a single gene.
- **Option D** involves codominance, which is not relevant since the color is determined by a single gene.
- **Option E** mentions multiple alleles, which isn't applicable as there's only one allele.
- **Option F** claims soil determines color, which is correct, but the question seeks the best explanation.
- **Option G** discusses incomplete dominance, which doesn't apply here as the trait is governed by a single dominant allele.
- **Option H** suggests pollination, which doesn't affect flower color.
- **Option I** refers to sunlight, which isn't related to flower color.
- **Option J** ties to mutations, which don't explain phenotypic variation.

The best explanation is that the environment (soil) alters the expression of the trait, making **Option B** correct.

**ANSWER: B**
