Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says a student drops a water balloon from the roof of the tallest building. Her roommate is on the ground and is too quick. The first student ducks back but hears the splash 4.021 seconds after dropping the balloon. The speed of sound is given as 331 m/s. We need to find the height of the building, neglecting air resistance.

Hmm, okay. So, when the balloon is dropped, two things happen: the balloon falls, and the sound of the splash travels back up to the student. The total time is the time it takes for the balloon to fall plus the time it takes for the sound to come back up. So, the total time is the sum of the time of fall (t1) and the time of the sound (t2). 

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. The student hears the splash after t1 + t2 = 4.021 s. So, the total time is t1 + t2 = 4.021 s.

But how do I find t1 and t2?

Well, for the free fall part: the distance fallen is the height of the building, h. The equation for the distance under free fall is h = (1/2) g t1², where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the problem says to neglect air resistance, that's the case.

And for the sound part: the sound travels back up the same distance h, but at a speed of 331 m/s. So, the time taken for the sound to reach the student is t2 = h / (331). 

So, the total time is t1 + t2 = 4.021 s.

So, let's write the equations:

h = (1/2) g t1² → equation 1

t2 = h / 331 → equation 2

And, t1 + t2 = 4.021 → equation 3.

I need to solve for h. 

Hmm, perhaps substitute equation 2 into equation 3.

So, t1 + (h / 331) = 4.021.

But from equation 1, h = (1/2) g t1². Let's substitute that in.

So: t1 + [ ( (1/2) g t1² ) / 331 ] = 4.021.

But wait, what's the value of g? I think it's approximately 9.8 m/s². Let me use that.

Substituting g = 9.8 m/s²:

t1 + [ (9.8 * t1² ) / (2 * 331) ) ] = 4.021.

Let me compute 2*331 = 662. So 9.8/(2*331) = 9.8 /662 ≈ 0.01485 s²/m²? Wait, no, wait, the units are a bit tricky.

Wait, 9.8 m/s² divided by 662 m/s²? No, wait: 9.8 is in m/s², and 662 is in m. So 9.8/(2*331) is (9.8)/(662) = approximately 0.01485 s²/m? Hmm, maybe better to compute the numerical factor.

So, 9.8 / 662 ≈ 0.01485 s². 

So, the equation becomes:

t1 + (0.01485 * t1²) = 4.021.

But wait, that's a quadratic equation, but actually, a quadratic in terms of t1², but let's arrange it as:

0.01485 * t1² + t1 - 4.021 = 0.

That's a quadratic equation in terms of t1: a t1² + b t1 + c = 0, where a ≈ 0.01485, b = 1, c = -4.021.

The quadratic formula is t = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). But since time can't be negative, we'll take the positive solution.

So, discriminant D = b² -4ac = (1)^2 -4*(0.01485)*(-4.021).

Compute that: 1 - 4*(0.01485)*(-4.021) → 1 + 4 * 0.01485 *4.021.

Calculate 4 * 0.01485 = 0.0594. Multiply by 4.021 → 0.0594 *4.021 ≈ 0.0594*4 ≈ 0.2376, but more accurately: 4.021 * 0.0594.

Let me compute 4 * 0.0594 = 0.2376, 0.021 * 0.0594 ≈ 0.0012474. So total ≈ 0.2376 + 0.0012474 ≈0.23885.

So, D ≈ 1 + 0.23885 = 1.23885.

Square root of D: sqrt(1.23885) ≈ 1.113.

So, t1 = [ -1 + 1.113 ]/(2 * 0.01485 )

Wait, wait, because the other solution would be negative, so we take the positive.

Wait, the quadratic equation solution: [ -b ± sqrt(D) ]/(2a). So, after the discriminant, the two roots are:

t1 = [ -1 + 1.113 ] / (2 *0.01485) → (0.113)/(0.0297) ≈ 3.806 seconds.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if t1 is about 3.8 seconds, then the time for the sound is about 4.021 -3.8 = 0.221 s. That would require the sound to travel 3.8 meters in 0.221 seconds. But speed of sound is 331 m/s. So 331 * 0.221 ≈ 73 meters. But h would be (1/2) *9.8*(3.8)^2.

Wait, let me compute that. 3.8 squared is 14.44. 14.44 *9.8 = 141.712. Half is 70.86 m. So h ≈70.86 meters. Then the sound would take h/331 ≈70.86/331 ≈0.214 s. So total time is 3.8 +0.214 =4.014 s, which is close to 4.021, but perhaps the approximation is a bit off.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the quadratic solution.

Wait, a is 0.01485, b is 1, c is -4.021.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac → 1 -4*(0.01485)*(-4.021) → 1 + 4*0.01485*4.021.

Wait, 4 *0.01485 is 0.0594. 0.0594 *4.021 = let's compute 4 *0.0594=0.2376, 0.021 *0.0594=0.0012474. So total 0.2376 + 0.0012474=0.23885. So D =1 +0.23885=1.23885.

Square root of D: sqrt(1.23885)= approx 1.113.

So, t1 = [ -1 +1.113 ]/(2 *0.01485) → (0.113)/(0.0297) → approximately 3.806 seconds.

Wait, that's the same as before. But then, the time for sound is 4.021 -3.806 =0.215 s. So, h = (1/2) *9.8*(3.806)^2.

Compute 3.806 squared: 3.8^2 is 14.44, plus 0.006^2 (negligible) and cross terms 2*3.8*0.006=0.0456. So 14.44 +0.0456=14.4856. Multiply by 9.8:14.4856 *9.8 → let's compute 14 *9.8=137.2, 0.4856*9.8≈4.76, so total is about 141.96. Half that is 70.98 m.

Then h=70.98 m. Then time for sound is 70.98/331 ≈0.214 s. So total time is 3.806 +0.214=4.020 s, which matches the given 4.021 s. Oh, wait, I think I miscalculated the initial steps. So perhaps the correct value is around 71 m.

But looking at the options, option A is 71 m. So that's the answer. But wait, what about the quadratic solution I did. Let me do it more precisely, perhaps using more accurate numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me re-examine the quadratic equation.

The equation was:

0.01485 t1² + t1 −4.021 =0 → 0.01485 t1² + t1 −4.021 =0.

Using the quadratic formula, t1 = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ]/(2a), where a=0.01485, b=1, c= -4.021.

Discriminant D = 1^2 -4*(0.01485)*(-4.021) =1 + 4*0.01485*4.021.

Compute 4 * 0.01485 = 0.0594. Multiply by 4.021: 0.0594 *4.021 = let's compute it step by step.

0.0594 *4 = 0.2376. 0.0594 *0.021: 0.0012474. So, 0.2376 + 0.0012474 = 0.2388474.

So D=1 +0.2388474=1.2388474.

Square root of D: √1.2388474 ≈1.113.

So, t1 = [ -1 +1.113 ]/(2 * 0.01485) → (0.113)/(0.0297) → approximately 3.806 s.

Wait, but perhaps more precise calculation: 0.113 divided by 0.0297.

Let me compute 0.113 ÷ 0.0297.

0.0297 *3=0.0891, which is less than 0.113. 3.8 *0.0297 = 3 *0.0297=0.0891, 0.8 *0.0297=0.02376. Sum: 0.0891+0.02376=0.11286.

So 3.8 gives 0.11286. The target is 0.113. So, 0.0297 * x =0.113 → x≈3.8 + (0.00014 /0.0297) → approx 3.8 +0.00473≈3.80473. So t1≈3.8047 seconds.

Then, the time for the sound: 4.021 -3.8047 =0.2163 s. So, h = (1/2) *9.8 * (3.8047)^2.

Compute 3.8047^2: 3.8^2 is 14.44. 0.0047^2 is negligible. Cross term: 2 *3.8 *0.0047=0.03596. So 14.44 +0.03596=14.47596.

Multiply by 9.8:14.47596 *9.8.

Let me compute that: 14 *9.8=137.2, 0.47596*9.8=4.6643. So total is 141.8643 m. Half of that is 70.932 m.

Hmm, so h≈70.93 m. The options have A as 71 m. So the correct answer is 71 m, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, another thought: sometimes when time is involved, the quadratic may have two solutions, but the time for the balloon would be the larger root perhaps? Or did I make a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the total time as the sum of the time it takes for the balloon to fall, and the time it takes for the sound to come back. 

But solving the quadratic equation as I did gives h≈70.93 m, which is 71 m. So the answer is A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh, the options include 'E: 78 m' and 'F:85 m'. Hmm, why? Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the quadratic formula. Let me re-calculate the discriminant D with more precision.

Wait, let me compute 4 *0.01485*4.021. 0.01485 *4.021 = (0.014 *4.021) + (0.00085*4.021) → 0.056294 + 0.003416 ≈ 0.05971. So 4 * that is 0.23884.

So D =1 + 0.23884 =1.23884. Square root is about 1.113.

So t1 = [ -1 +1.113 ]/(2*0.01485) → 0.113/(0.0297) → approx 3.8047 s.

So h= (1/2)*9.8*(3.8047)^2.

Compute (3.8047)^2:

3.8^2 =14.44. 0.0047^2=0.000022. Cross term: 2 *3.8 *0.0047= 0.03596.

So 14.44 +0.03596 =14.47596.

Multiply by 9.8: 14.47596 *9.8 = let's compute:

14 *9.8 =137.2, 0.47596 *9.8 = 4.664408.

So total is 137.2 +4.664408 =141.864408.

Half is 70.932204 m. So around 70.93 m. So the closest option is 71 m, option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the given time is 4.021 s. So, when h is 70.93 m, the time for the balloon to fall is t1 = sqrt(2h/g) = sqrt(2*70.93/9.8) → sqrt( (141.86)/9.8 ) → sqrt(14.4755) → approx 3.804 s.

Then, the time for sound is (70.93)/331 ≈0.214 s. 3.804 +0.214 =4.018 s, which is almost 4.021. So there's a slight discrepancy, but perhaps it's due to rounding. So, the correct answer is 71 m (option A).

The problem involves a water balloon dropped from a building, with the sound of the splashing traveling back to the student. The total time for this process is given as 4.021 seconds. To find the height of the building, we analyze the two parts of the motion:

1. **Free Fall (Water Balloon)**:  
   The height \( h \) is related to the time \( t_1 \) it takes for the balloon to fall by the equation:  
   \[
   h = \frac{1}{2} g t_1^2 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]  
   where \( g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \).

2. **Sound Travel**:  
   The sound of the splash travels back to the student, covering the same height \( h \). The time for this part is:  
   \[
   t_2 = \frac{h}{v_{\text{sound}}} \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]  
   where \( v_{\text{sound}} = 331 \, \mathrm{m/s} \).

3. **Total Time**:  
   The total time is the sum of the two times:  
   \[
   t_1 + t_2 = 4.021 \, \mathrm{s} \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
   \]  

### Solving the Equations:
- From Equation 1:  
  \[
  h = \frac{1}{2} g t_1^2
  \]  
- From Equation 2:  
  \[
  t_2 = \frac{h}{331}
  \]  
- Substitute \( h \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:  
  \[
  t_2 = \frac{\frac{1}{2} g t_1^2}{331} = \frac{g t_1^2}{662}
  \]  
- Substitute \( t_2 \) into Equation 3:  
  \[
  t_1 + \frac{g t_1^2}{662} = 4.021
  \]  
- This is a quadratic equation in \( t_1 \):  
  \[
  \frac{g}{662} t_1^2 + t_1 - 4.021 = 0
  \]  
  Substituting \( g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \):  
  \[
  \frac{9.8}{662} t_1^2 + t_1 - 4.021 = 0
  \]  
  Simplify the coefficient:  
  \[
  0.01485 t_1^2 + t_1 - 4.021 = 0
  \]  
- Solve using the quadratic formula:  
  \[
  t_1 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]  
  Here, \( a = 0.01485 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -4.021 \).  
  Compute the discriminant:  
  \[
  D = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4(0.01485)(-4.021) = 1 + 0.23885 = 1.23885
  \]  
  Take the positive root:  
  \[
  \sqrt{D} = \sqrt{1.23885} \approx 1.113
  \]  
  Substitute into the quadratic formula:  
  \[
  t_1 = \frac{-1 + 1.113}{2(0.01485)} = \frac{0.113}{0.0297} \approx 3.806 \, \mathrm{s}
  \]  

- Calculate \( t_2 \):  
  \[
  t_2 = 4.021 - t_1 = 4.021 - 3.806 = 0.215 \, \mathrm{s}
  \]  

- Calculate \( h \) using \( h = \frac{1}{2} g t_1^2 \):  
  \[
  h = \frac{1}{2} (9.8) (3.806)^2
  \]  
  Compute \( (3.806)^2 \):  
  \[
  (3.806)^2 \approx 14.485
  \]  
  Multiply by \( 9.8 \):  
  \[
  h \approx \frac{1}{2} (9.8) (14.485) = 70.93 \, \mathrm{m}
  \]  

- The closest option to \( h \approx 70.93 \, \mathrm{m} \) is **71 m** (Option A).
