Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which type of stress is dominant at divergent boundaries. Hmm, I remember that divergent boundaries are where tectonic plates are moving away from each other. Like, the Earth's crust. But wait, what exactly are the different types of stress involved here?

I think there are two main types of stress. One is compressional, which is when rocks are being pushed together. That's usually at convergent boundaries, where plates are coming together and forming mountain ranges. But this question is about divergent, so that's pushing them apart.

Then there's tensional stress. That's when the plates are being pulled apart, like when two plates are moving away from each other. Right, so if the plates are moving away, that's tension because they're stretching apart, not compressing.

Wait, what about the other options like horizontal, shear, etc.? I'm a bit confused. Oh, right, horizontal stress might refer to the in-plane stress, like the horizontal forces. But in divergent boundaries, are those horizontal or are they more along the strike direction?

Shear stress is when there's a force that's applied perpendicular to the boundary. So for example, if one plate is pushing down and the other is pushing up, that creates shear stress. That seems right for divergent boundaries because the plates are moving in opposite directions, causing the force to be perpendicular.

Looking at the options, the question asks which type is dominant. So in areas where two plates are moving away, they're experiencing tensional stress. That's because they're being stretched apart, which creates tension. So the correct answer should be E: Tensional.

Wait, does that make sense? I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me think again. Convergent boundaries are compressional because the plates are being squeezed together. Divergent is tension because they're pushing apart. So for divergent, it's tensional. So E is the answer.

The type of stress dominant at divergent boundaries is tensional. At these boundaries, plates are moving away from each other, creating tension. This tension is due to the plates being stretched apart. 

Answer: E
