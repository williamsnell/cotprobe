Okay, so I need to figure out who was on the $500 bill. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the $500 bill was a significant denomination introduced in the late 19th century. I'm trying to recall the names of the people associated with it.

Wait, the options are Calvin Coolidge, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Andrew Jackson, William McKinley, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, and Aaron Burr. I think the $500 bill was presented by Andrew Jackson. Let me double-check that.

Andrew Jackson was a US President, right? He was the third President of the United States, after George Washington and John Adams. So Andrew Jackson was indeed on the $500 bill. I'm pretty sure that's correct because that's a famous event in history. I don't think any other of these people was on the $500 bill. Calvin Coolidge was the president of the United States from 1892 to 1924 and was on a different bill, I believe. George Washington was the first to wear the $500 bill. So yeah, Andrew Jackson was the one.

The correct answer is Andrew Jackson, as he was the president who presented the $500 bill.
