Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve. The question is about finding the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum (a₁ + 2a₂ + ... + n aₙ) divided by n². We're given that the limit of aₙ as n approaches infinity is 1. Hmm, let's think this through.

First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving sums and sequences, especially when each term aₙ approaches a certain value, we might need to use some approximation techniques. Since aₙ approaches 1, maybe we can approximate aₙ as 1 for sufficiently large n. But wait, the sum involves n terms, each multiplied by their index. So the numerator is a weighted sum of aₙ, where each term is weighted by its index.

Let me write down what's given and what's needed. The limit is:

limₙ→∞ (a₁ + 2a₂ + ... + n aₙ) / n²

Which is the same as limₙ→∞ (Σₖ=1^n k aₖ) / n².

I need to find this limit. I'm wondering if I can approximate the sum Σ k aₖ. Since each aₖ is close to 1 for large k, maybe I can approximate this sum.

But wait, the sum is up to n, so for k up to n, each aₖ is approximately 1. So the sum Σ k aₖ is approximately Σ k * 1 = Σk from k=1 to n. The sum of the first n integers is n(n+1)/2. So Σk from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2.

So substituting that into the expression, we have approximately (n(n+1)/2) / n². Simplify that: (n² + n)/2n² = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, 1/n becomes negligible, so the limit would be 1/2.

Wait, but in that case, the limit is 1/2. Looking at the options, option A is 0.5, which is 1/2. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me think again. Is that approximation valid? Because when n is large, the terms in the sum might not all be exactly 1. So each aₖ is close to 1, but maybe there's a more precise way to handle this.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of Cesàro mean or something related. The expression (a₁ + 2a₂ + ... + n aₙ) is like a weighted average where each aₖ is weighted by k. Since each aₖ approaches 1, in the limit, the sum would approach the sum of k from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)/2. Dividing by n² gives [n²/2 + n/2]/n² = (1/2 + 1/(2n)) which tends to 1/2 as n→∞.

So that would confirm that the limit is 1/2, option A.

Wait, but what if aₙ isn't exactly approaching 1? Like, perhaps aₙ approaches 1, but maybe the convergence is slow. But in the limit, as n grows, the difference becomes negligible. So the approximation should hold. Therefore, the limit should be 1/2.

The limit is calculated by approximating the weighted sum of aₙ, recognizing that aₙ approaches 1, leading to the sum being approximately the sum of the first n integers. Dividing by n² simplifies to 1/2 as n approaches infinity, so the answer is A.

Answer: A
