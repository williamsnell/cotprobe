Okay, so I've got this question about money-creating potential in a banking system. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question says that the banking system's total demand deposits are $80,000,000 and the reserves are $17,000,000. The legal reserve ratio is 10%. Then, the Federal Reserve doubles the required reserve ratio. I need to find out by how much the money-creating potential drops.

Hmm, money-creating potential is the maximum amount of money that can be created through the banking system, right? I remember that the money multiplier is the factor by which a deposit multiplies the money supply. The money multiplier formula is 1 divided by the reserve ratio (or the required reserve ratio). 

Wait, the required reserve ratio is also called the reserve ratio in this context. So initially, the reserve ratio is 10%, which is 0.10. So the money multiplier before doubling is 1 / 0.10 = 10.

The money-creating potential is how much the money supply can increase based on the reserves. The formula I think is money multiplier multiplied by the change in reserves. But wait, actually, the money multiplier represents how much the money supply increases for each dollar of reserves. So with total reserves, the money supply increase would be (1/multiplier) * new reserve?

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The money supply created is equal to the reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. Because when you have some reserves, those can be lent out, and those amounts of money can be deposited again, and so on. So the formula is: Money Created = Reserves × (1 / Required Reserve Ratio).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh, wait, money multiplifier is 1 / RRR. So money created is Reserves × (1 / RRR). So original money created would be 17,000,000 * 10. Let me calculate that. 17,000,000 * 10 is 170,000,000. But that's the initial money in the system. Wait, but in the question, the total deposits are 80 million, and reserves are 17 million. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing deposits and reserves. Because the money supply is determined by the monetary base (deposits) multiplied by the money multiplier.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the monetary base. The money multiplier is 1 / RR. So the money multiplier is 10. So the potential money created is the initial reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. Wait, no. Wait, the money created would be the initial reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. Because if you have $17M in reserves and the money multiplier is 10, then 17M * 10 = 170M. But wait, that would mean that the money supply would be increased by 170M. But that doesn't make sense because the monetary base is only 80M, so the maximum possible would be 80M * 10 = 800M. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1 / RR. So when the reserve ratio increases, the money multiplier decreases, thus the money-creating potential (the maximum money that can be created) decreases.

Wait, but in this question, the reserve ratio is 10% initially. After doubling, the required ratio becomes 20%. So the new money multiplier is 1 / 0.20 = 5.

Wait, but the original money-creating potential would have been: the initial reserves are 17,000,000. So the money that can be created is 17,000,000 * 10 = 170,000,000. But wait, the total deposits are 80,000,000, so that's the monetary base. So the maximum money supply is 80M * 10 = 800M. So the money-creating potential here is the potential beyond the current money supply. Hmm, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, the money-creating potential is the maximum possible increase in the money supply given the current reserves. Or perhaps the initial reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. Alternatively, the money-creating potential is the amount that can be created by the existing reserves. Because the existing reserves can be lent out, which is the money that can be created.

Wait, perhaps the money-creating potential is the amount that can be lent out, which is the reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. So the initial money-creating potential is 17M * 10 = 170M. But that can't be right, because the monetary base is 80M, and 170M is larger than that.

I think I need to clarify. The money-creating potential is the maximum amount that can be multiplied and released into the economy. The money multiplier is 1 / RRR. So the initial money supply is the monetary base (deposits) multiplied by the money multiplier. But the money-creating potential is how much more can be created beyond the current money supply.

Alternatively, the money-creating potential is the amount that can be lent out, which is the initial reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. Because when you have reserves, that money can be lent out, and that money can be deposited again, creating more money.

Wait, the question says, "money-creating potential of the banking system as a whole." So the entire banking system's potential. So, initially, the reserves are 17M. So the money that can be created is 17M * 10 = 170M. But wait, the money supply is already higher than that? No, because the monetary base is 80M, so 80M * 10 = 800M. So the maximum potential is 800M - current money supply (which is 170M?), but I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the money-creating potential is the maximum amount that can be increased by the economy, which is the initial reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. Because each dollar in the reserves can be lent out and create a dollar in the money supply. So 17M * 10 = 170M. But that's the initial creation. Oh wait, but the monetary base is 80M, so 80M * 10 would be 800M, so the maximum is 800M - 170M = 630M. But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, the question is not about the maximum, but about the effect of doubling the required reserve ratio. So before, the required ratio is 10% (0.10). After doubling, it's 20% (0.20). 

So, the money multiplier before was 10, after is 5. So the money-creating potential before was 17M * 10 = 170M. After, it's 17M *5 = 85M.

So the change in the money-creating potential is 170M - 85M = 85M. Wait, but the question is by how much will the money-creating potential of the banking system as a whole drop. So 170M -85M=85 million. But the options don't have 85M as the amount it decreases. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G says $90,000,000 to $5,000,000. The change is 85M, but the options are not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question.

Wait, another approach. The money-creating potential is the amount of money that can be created, which is the monetary base multiplied by the money multiplier. So initially, the money multiplier is 10, so the money-creating potential was 80M *10=800M. After the reserve ratio doubles, the money multiplier becomes 5, so new potential is 80M *5=400M. The change is 800M -400M=400M. So the potential has dropped by 400 million. But the question is, by how much does the money-creating potential drop?

Wait, the question is: "by how much will the money-creating potential of the banking system as a whole drop?" Oh, wait. The initial money-creating potential is 80M *10=800M. After doubling the reserve ratio, the money-creating potential becomes 80M *5=400M. So the drop is 400M. But none of the options have 400 million as the drop. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are all about the change in the potential. Let me recheck the options.

Options:

A: $70,000,000 to $35,000,000 (difference 35M)
B: $60,000,000 to $20,000,000 (difference 40M)
C: $80,000,000 to $0 (drop of 80M)
D: $80,000,000 to $25,000,000 (drop 55M)
E: $100,000,000 to $8,500,000 (drop 91.5M)
F: $80,000,000 to $10,000,000 (drop 70M)
G: $90,000,000 to $5,000,000 (drop 85M)
H: $85,000,000 to $15,000,000 (drop 70M)
I: $75,000,000 to $17,000,000 (drop 58M)
J: $65,000,000 to $30,000,000 (drop 35M)

Wait, option G says the potential drops from 90M to 5M, a drop of 85M. But according to our calculation, the drop is 400M. But none of the options have 400 million. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I got the money-creating potential wrong. Let me think again. The money-creating potential is the total money that can be created from the initial reserves. The initial reserves are 17M. The money multiplier is 1 / RR. So the potential is 17M * 10=170M. If the reserve ratio doubles, the new RR is 20%, so the new money multiplier is 5. So the potential is 80M *5=400M. So the drop is 170M -400M= -230M? No, that doesn't match options.

Wait, but the question is about the change in the money-creating potential. Oh wait, perhaps the way it's phrased, the money-creating potential is the amount that can be created, and we're to find the drop when the reserve ratio doubles.

Wait, maybe the initial money-creating potential is 17M *10=170M. After doubling, it's 80M *5=400M. So the change is 170M -400M= -230M, but that's a decrease. But the options don't have a drop of 230M.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the money-creating potential refers to the increase possible. So when the reserve ratio doubles, the money multiplier becomes 1/0.2=5. So the new potential is 80M *5 =400M. The initial potential was 80M *10=800M. So the drop is 800M -400M=400M. But the options don't have 400M as the drop. So perhaps the question is asking by how much the potential decreases, not the total.

Wait, how much does the money-creating potential decrease? So, original potential is 800M, new is 400M. So the drop is 400M. But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the money-creating potential. Let me think again.

Wait, original reserves are 17M. The money multiplier is 10. So the money-creating potential is 17M *10=170M. So the money-creating potential is 170M. After the reserve ratio doubles, the money multiplier is 5. Potential is 80M *5=400M. So the decrease is 170M to 400M, which is a drop of 130M. But the options don't have 130M. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the change in the money-creating potential, which is 170M -400M= -230M, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the money-creating potential.

Wait, another thought: the money-creating potential is the amount of money that can be created through the banking system, not just the reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. Wait, no, that's the same thing.

Alternatively, the money-creating potential is the maximum amount that can be created beyond the existing reserves. So, the initial money-creating potential is 17M *10=170M. After the change, 80M *5=400M. So the money-creating potential decreases by 170M -400M= -230M. But none of the options match this.

Wait, but the options are about the change in the money-creating potential. So perhaps the question is asking by how much does the potential decrease. So the initial potential was 170M, and after it's 400M, so the decrease is 230M. But looking at the options, none seem to match 230M. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the money-creating potential from the money supply, but from the reserves. Let me think again.

Wait, in the original scenario, the money-creating potential is 17M * 10 = 170M. After the change, it's 80M *5=400M. So the potential has decreased by 170M -400M= -230M. But the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the money-creating potential as a percentage of the existing reserves, not the total economy.

Wait, the question says, "the money-creating potential of the banking system as a whole drop." So perhaps the potential is the maximum possible, and the change is the difference.

Wait, another approach: the money-creating potential is the maximum increase possible. The initial money-creating potential is 170M (17M *10). After doubling, it's 400M (80M *5). So the money-creating potential has dropped by 170M -400M= -230M. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the change in the money-creating potential. The original potential is 170M. After the change, it's 400M. So the decrease is 170M -400M= -230M. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is about the new potential and the initial potential, but the options don't have a drop of 230 million. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate.

Original reserves: $17M.

Initial money multiplier: 1/0.10=10. So 17M *10=170M.

After doubling reserve ratio, new RR is 0.20. New money multiplier is 1/0.20=5. New potential:80M *5=400M.

So the potential has gone from 170M to 400M. The change is 170M-400M= -230M.

But none of the answer options match 230M. So perhaps the question is about the change in the money-creating potential, not the actual potential.

Wait, another possibility: The money-creating potential is the amount that can be created, which is the money supply. So, initially, the money supply is 80M *10=800M. After the change, the money supply is 80M *5=400M. So the money-creating potential (the increase in money supply) is 800M -400M=400M. But the options don't have 400M as the drop; the options are about the new potential and the old.

Wait, the question is: "by how much will the money-creating potential of the banking system as a whole drop?"

Wait, perhaps the initial money-creating potential was 170M. After, 400M. So the drop is 170M -400M= -230M. But the options don't have any that match 230M. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: The money-creating potential refers to the maximum amount that can be lent out, which is the existing reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. So, 17M *10=170M.

After doubling, the money multiplier is 5. So the new potential is 80M *5=400M.

The change is 170M -400M= -230M. But none of the options correspond to a 230M drop.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the potential in the money supply, not the reserves. Let's see:

Original money supply: 80M *10=800M.

After doubling, 80M *5=400M.

So the decrease is 800M -400M=400M.

But the options don't have an option that shows the change as 400M. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the money-creating potential is the amount that can be created beyond the money supply. Or perhaps it's the maximum that can be created, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about another approach. The money-creating potential is the amount of money that can be created through the banking system. So the initial money-creating potential is the total reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. After the change, the new money-creating potential is the new reserves (which are the same as before, 17M) multiplied by the new money multiplier.

Wait, but the question is about the effect of the reserve ratio change on the money-creating potential. So the initial money-creating potential is 17M *10=170M. After the change, it's 17M *5=85M. So the drop is 170M -85M=85M. But the options don't have 85M as the correct drop.

Wait, looking again at the options, option F says the potential drops from 80M to 10M, a drop of 70M. Option G says from 90M to5M, a drop of 85M. So option G is a 85M drop.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the drop is 85M. So that would correspond to option G.

Wait, but in the first scenario, the money-creating potential is 170M. After the change, it's 85M. So the drop is 85M. So the answer would be option G: $90,000,000 to $5,000,000, a drop of 85M.

Wait, but I'm getting a 85M drop. So option G is correct. So the answer is option G.

Wait, but earlier I thought the drop is 230M, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is that the money-creating potential is the amount that can be created from the existing reserves, so 17M*10=170M initially, and 80M*5=400M after. So the drop is 170M -400M= -230M. But this isn't an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the drop in the money-creating potential but the change in the money-creating potential. So the change would be 170M -400M= -230M. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the change in the money-creating potential for the entire banking system. Let me think again.

Wait, the money-creating potential is the total money that can be created in the economy. So, the initial money-creating potential is 80M *10=800M. After the change, it's 80M*5=400M. So the drop is 800M -400M=400M. But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the change in the money-creating potential, which is 170M to 85M, so a drop of 85M. So the correct answer is option G.

Hmm, so I think the correct answer is option G: $90,000,000 to $5,000,000, a drop of 85M.
</think>

The question asks by how much the money-creating potential of the banking system as a whole will drop after the reserve ratio doubles. Initially, the money-creating potential is calculated as the total money that can be created, which is the monetary base multiplied by the money multiplier. After the reserve ratio doubles, the money multiplier changes, and the money-creating potential decreases further.

1. **Initial Money Multiplier and Potential:**
   - Legal reserves = $17$ million.
   - Initial reserve ratio = 10% → money multiplier = 10.
   - Initial money-creating potential = $17$ million * 10 = $170$ million.

2. **After Doubling Reserve Ratio:**
   - New reserve ratio = 20% → new money multiplier = 5.
   - New money-creating potential = $80$ million * 5 = $400$ million.

3. **Change in Money-Creating Potential:**
   - The money-creating potential has dropped by $170$ million - $400$ million = $85$ million.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: $90,000,000 to $5,000,000, a drop of $85,000,000$**.

ANSWER: G
