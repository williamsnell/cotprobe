Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a bullet and the heat it generates when stopped by a steel plate. The options are all different orders of magnitude, so I guess I need to calculate the energy involved.

First, the details: the bullet's mass is 50 grams, and it's traveling at 40,000 cm per second. We're supposed to stop it, so all the kinetic energy will convert into heat. I remember that kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but I'm a bit fuzzy on the units, especially with cm and grams. Hmm.

Wait, the options are in ergs. Oh right, ergs are the unit of energy. The formula for kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's think.

Mass is given in grams, and velocity in cm/s. I know that 1 gram is 0.001 kg, and 1 cm/s is 0.01 m/s. Oh, right! Because to convert cm to meters, you divide by 100, and to convert seconds to hours, wait, wait, but wait, the units of velocity here are cm/s, so that's 0.01 m/s. Let's proceed.

So, mass m is 50 grams, which is 0.05 kg. Velocity v is 40,000 cm/s, which is 400 m/s. Wait, wait, 40,000 cm is 40000 * 0.01 m = 400 m/s. Oh, right, because 1 cm is 0.01 meters. So 40,000 cm is 400 * 100 cm, wait no, 40,000 cm = 400 meters? Wait, 40,000 cm is 400 * 100? No, wait, 1 m is 100 cm. So 40,000 cm is 400 meters? No, wait, 40,000 cm divided by 100 is 400 meters. So yes, 40,000 cm/s is 400 m/s.

So now, plug into KE = 0.5 * m * v². Let's compute that.

m = 0.05 kg
v = 400 m/s

v squared is (400)^2 = 160,000 m²/s².

KE = 0.5 * 0.05 * 160,000.

Let me calculate that step by step. 0.5 * 0.05 is 0.025. 0.025 * 160,000 = ?

160,000 * 0.025. Let's break it down: 160,000 * 0.02 is 3,200. 160,000 * 0.005 is 800. So 3,200 + 800 = 4,000 J. So the kinetic energy is 4,000 joules.

Wait, but the question says to convert that into ergs. Oh, wait, 1 joule is 10^7 ergs. Because 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s², and 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s². Since 1 kg is 1000 grams, 1 m is 100 cm. So 1 J = 1000 g * (100 cm)^2 / (s²) = 1000 * 10000 g cm²/s² = 10^7 ergs. So 1 J = 1e7 erg.

So 4,000 J is 4,000 * 1e7 ergs. 4e3 *1e7 = 4e10 ergs.

Looking at the options, option D is 7e10, option B is 8e10, etc. Wait, wait, wait, I just got 4e10. But the options don't have 4e10. Hmm. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in unit conversions. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the mass is 50 grams, which is 0.05 kg. Velocity is 40,000 cm/s, which is 400 m/s. Let's compute v squared: (400)^2 = 160,000 m²/s². Correct.

KE = 0.5 * 0.05 kg * 160,000 (m²/s²) = 0.5 * 0.05 * 160,000.

Compute 0.05 * 160,000 first: 0.05 *160,000 = 8,000. Then 0.5 * 8,000 = 4,000 J.

So 4000 J. Then converting to ergs: 4000 J * 1e7 erg/J = 4e10 erg.

Looking back at the options: option D is 7e10, B is 8e10. Hmm, but none of the options have 4e10. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, another approach: maybe using different units from the start.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with the given units.

KE = (1/2) m v². Where m is in grams, v in cm/s. So:

m = 50 g.

v = 40,000 cm/s.

So KE = 0.5 * 50 g * (40,000 cm/s )².

Compute that:

= 0.5 *50 * (40,000)^2 * g * (cm²/s²).

g is 980 cm/s²? Wait, no. Wait, actually, I'm getting confused here. Wait, the units of energy here are in ergs, which is g cm²/s². So the calculation would be in terms of g cm²/s².

Hmm, but perhaps I can compute the energy in g cm²/s², then convert to ergs.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy in different units.

Wait, perhaps I can compute v in m/s and m in kg, and then compute the energy in joules, then convert to erg.

Wait, let's try that.

v = 40,000 cm/s = 400 m/s.

m = 50 grams = 0.05 kg.

KE = 0.5 * m * v² = 0.5 * 0.05 kg * (400)^2 (m²/s²).

= 0.5 * 0.05 * 160,000 (kg m²/s²)

= 0.5 * 0.05 * 160,000.

0.05 *160,000 = 8,000.

0.5 *8,000 =4,000 J.

Now, 1 J = 1e7 ergs, so 4,000 J = 4e3 *1e7 ergs = 4e10 ergs.

So the answer would be 4e10 ergs. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: 1.2e11

B:8e10

C:5e9

D:7e10

E:3e10

F:4e10

G:6e10

H:1e11

I:2e10

J:9e10.

Wait, none of them are 4e10. So perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let me check the multiplication again.

0.5 * 0.05 = 0.025.

0.025 * 160,000 = ?

Let me calculate 160,000 * 0.025.

0.025 is 1/40, so 160,000 /40 = 4,000. So yes, 4,000 J.

So 4e3 J * 1e7 erg/J = 4e10 erg.

But wait, perhaps I should make sure about the velocity unit conversion. Wait, 40,000 cm/s is 400 m/s, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula. Oh wait, the question says "heat generated". So perhaps it's not all the kinetic energy, but some other form. No, the bullet is stopped, so all KE goes into heat.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it step by step.

m = 50 grams = 0.05 kg.

v = 400 m/s.

KE = 0.5 * 0.05 kg * (400)^2.

(400)^2 = 160,000.

0.5 * 0.05 = 0.025.

0.025 * 160,000 = 4,000 J.

4,000 J → 4,000 * 1e7 =4e10 erg.

So, 4e10 ergs. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a decimal point.

Wait, looking at the options again: all are multiples of 1e10 or 1e9. Let me check the options for 4e10.

The options are:

A: 1.2e11 → 12e10 → 120 billion.

B:8e10 → 8e10.

C:5e9.

D:7e10.

E:3e10.

F:4e10.

So option F is 4e10.

Wait wait, but wait, perhaps I miscalculated the velocity. The bullet is traveling at 40,000 cm/s. Wait, 40,000 cm is 400 meters. So 400 m/s.

Wait, but perhaps the question intended the bullet to stop, so KE is 4,000 J, which is 4e3 J. Multiply by 1e7 to get ergs, that's 4e10 ergs. So option F is 4e10. So the answer would be F.

But wait, the options don't have 4e10. Let me see: yes, option F is 4e10 ergs, which is exactly what I calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial unit conversion. Let me think another way.

Wait, another approach: using the formula KE = (1/2) mv², but ensuring all units are correct.

m =50 grams = 0.05 kg.

v =40,000 cm/s =400 m/s.

So KE =0.5 *0.05 * (400)^2.

= 0.5 *0.05 *160,000.

= 0.5 * 8,000.

=4,000 J.

Convert J to erg: 1 J = 1e7 erg.

So 4e3 J = 4e3 *1e7 =4e10 erg.

So that's 4e10. But none of the options show 4e10. Oh wait, looking back, the options are:

A:1.2e11 → 12e10

B:8e10

C:5e9

D:7e10

E:3e10

F:4e10

G:6e10

H:1e11

I:2e10

J:9e10.

So yes, option F is 4e10. So the correct answer would be F.

But wait, the question says, "how much heat is generated, on the assumption that the energy is completely converted into heat?"

Wait, then why are the options A to J, and F is 4e10. So the correct answer should be F.
</think>

To determine the heat generated when a 50 g bullet traveling at 40,000 cm/s is stopped by a steel plate, we calculate the kinetic energy (KE) using the formula:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

### Step 1: Unit Conversion
The mass of the bullet is given as 50 g, which is equivalent to \( m = 0.05 \, \text{kg} \). The velocity is given as 40,000 cm/s, which is equivalent to \( v = 400 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Step 2: Calculate Kinetic Energy
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.05 \, \text{kg} \cdot (400 \, \text{m/s})^2
\]

1. Compute \( v^2 \):
   \[
   v^2 = (400)^2 = 160,000 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]

2. Multiply by \( m \):
   \[
   0.5 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 160,000 = 0.025 \cdot 160,000 = 4,000 \, \text{J}
   \]

Thus, the kinetic energy is \( 4,000 \, \text{J} \).

### Step 3: Convert to Ergs
Since \( 1 \, \text{J} = 10^7 \, \text{erg} \), the energy in ergs is:

\[
4,000 \, \text{J} \cdot 10^7 \, \text{erg}/\text{J} = 4 \times 10^{10} \, \text{erg}
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The calculated value is \( 4 \times 10^{10} \, \text{erg} \), which corresponds to **Option F**.
