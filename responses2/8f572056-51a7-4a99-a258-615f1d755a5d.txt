Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about decision-making, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about Mill's claims regarding how people decide how to act. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different approach. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that Mill's views on behaviorism and ethics are important here. Let me recall. Mill was a philosopher, I think, who wrote a book called "On Liberty and the Law," right? His views on decision-making are based on observable behavior and its consequences.

So, looking at the options:

A: Consult tradition. That sounds like he would take the most established methods and ideas, but I'm not sure if that's his main approach.

B: Always follow personal instincts. Mill's perspective is more about behavior than instincts, but maybe he does rely on personal feelings?

C: Depend on utility principles. Oh, this makes sense. Mill talked about utility, which is the satisfaction or benefit derived from an action. He believed that people's choices are guided by the utility they expect to gain, even if it's not always self-serving.

D: Always align with personal values. I think Mill said people should align with their values rather than just acting out of desire, which might not always lead to the best outcomes.

E: Do what's legally required. I'm not sure about this. I thought that Mill was against strict laws because people's ethical behavior can vary, especially if they're influenced by their instincts or social expectations.

F: Act for the most people. That sounds like social maximization, which may not align with Mill's view because he focused more on individual well-being.

G: Do what peers or society expects. This could be social norms, but again, not sure if it's Mill's main approach.

H: Calculate expected consequences. This seems more like a psychological approach, but I'm not certain. I think Mill was more about the psychological factors in decision-making rather than strictly calculating probabilities.

I: Do what makes us happy in the moment. That's more about self-interest and emotional factors, not Mill's approach.

J: Consult scripture. That's a religious approach, and I don't think Mill was particularly religious.

Wait, so putting it together. Mill's main idea is about how individuals make decisions based on the utility they expect, not on strict rules or calculations. So option C says "we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility." That sounds right.

I think about each option again. Option C aligns with Mill's belief that decisions are made according to the principle of utility, which is about the satisfaction or benefit. So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is:

**C: we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility.**

**Explanation:** Mill's philosophy emphasizes that decisions are guided by the principle of utility, which is the satisfaction or benefit derived from an action. He believed that individuals should rely on this principle to make decisions, rather than strict rules or self-interest. This aligns with option C.
