The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Immediately after a shooting incident, the police chased one of the shooters into an apartment where he was apprehended and arrested. While in the apartment, a detective noticed some antique furniture that seemed of collectors' quality and was out of place in the squalidly furnished quarters. He moved and turned over the pieces to look for markings and insignia. He called headquarters, and was told that items with those markings and descriptions were stolen from a museum six months earlier. He seized the items and arrested another occupant, who claimed he owned the items, on charges of burglary. That suspect filed a motion to suppress based on there being a warrantless search without probable cause. The police relied on the plain view doctrine. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?

Options:

A: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the officer did not immediately recognize the items as stolen property.
B: No, the evidence was properly seized because the officer had a right to investigate it further once he had properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances.
C: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the items were stolen.
D: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the officer was in a place where he was legally allowed to be when he observed the antique furniture.
E: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply to items that are not immediately identifiable as contraband or evidence of a crime.
F: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the police had no warrant to search the apartment for additional evidence.
G: No, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.
H: Yes, the evidence must be suppressed because the plain view doctrine does not apply where the officer had no probable cause to believe that the observed item was contraband.
I: Yes, the evidence will be suppressed because the police can never search a personal residence or seize any unrelated items after entering for exigent circumstances dealing with something else.
J: No, the evidence will not be suppressed because the plain view doctrine allows an officer to seize any item that he or she believes is evidence of a crime.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence suppression in a police chase. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario: After a shooting, the police chase a shooter into an apartment where he's arrested. Then a detective notices some old furniture that seems of collector's quality but out of place. He moves the pieces, looks for markings and insignia. He calls headquarters, who says those items were stolen six months ago from a museum. He seizes them and another occupant claims he owns them, so they're being arrested again. The suspect files a motion to suppress evidence because of a warrantless search without probable cause. The police used the plain view doctrine.

The question is whether the court will suppress the evidence. The options are A to J, each with different answers. I need to decide which is the correct one.

First, I need to recall the plain view doctrine. From what I remember, the plain view doctrine allows the police to seize evidence that appears to be contraband because it's in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was stolen. So, the key points are: plain view, reasonable suspicion, and exigent circumstances.

In this case, the items were in an apartment, and the detective moved them to look for markings and insignia. He called headquarters, which told him they were stolen from a museum six months ago. So, the plain view doctrine applies here because the items were in plain view (they looked like old furniture) and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that they were stolen.

The officer moved the pieces, looked for markings, and then called headquarters. He had the exigent circumstances to investigate further. So, the officer was in a position where he could move the furniture, look for evidence, and then seek more facts under exigent circumstances.

Now, the officer's motion is for suppression. So, the question is whether the court will allow it. According to the plain view doctrine, the officer should be allowed to seize the evidence, but only if the evidence is in plain view, there's a reasonable suspicion that it's contraband, and the search was for additional evidence under exigent circumstances.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because the officer didn't recognize the items as stolen. That seems incorrect because the plain view doctrine would require the items to be in plain view, not just the detective's perception.

Option B: No, the officer had the right to investigate further once properly entered. This sounds correct because the officer entered under exigent circumstances and had the right to investigate further after that.

Option C: No, the officer had a reasonable suspicion. That's a part of the doctrine, but the court may not suppress just because it's a reasonable suspicion; other factors like plain view and exigent circumstances are also important.

Option D: No, because the officer was legally allowed in. That makes sense because the officer was permitted to enter the apartment under exigent circumstances. So, the officer's entry is lawful, and they can seize evidence.

Option E: Yes, because plain view doesn't apply. No, that's incorrect because the plain view doctrine does apply here.

Option F: Yes, no warrant for the search. No, because the police had a warrant to do the search because they were in a position to enter under exigent circumstances.

Option G: No, because not in plain view. Incorrect because the items were in plain view.

Option H: Yes, plain view doesn't apply. No, because plain view does apply.

Option I: Yes, police can't search a personal residence. No, that's irrelevant here because the officer was in an apartment, not a personal residence.

Option J: No, plain view allows no seizure. No, that's incorrect because the plain view doctrine does allow it, but the officer must meet the conditions.

So, the correct answer should be Option B. But wait, I'm a bit confused because Option B is about being allowed to investigate further, which is a part of the plain view doctrine. The suppression motion is based on the plain view doctrine, but the suppression can only occur if the evidence is in plain view, and the officer had a reasonable suspicion. So, the suppression would be allowed if all conditions are met, but the options are about whether suppression will happen.

Wait, looking back, the question is whether the court will suppress the evidence. So, the correct answer depends on whether the plain view doctrine applies, which it does, so suppression should be allowed.

Wait, but the options are about whether suppression will occur. So, the options are about the reason for suppression, not whether it'll be suppressed.

Wait, the question is whether the court will suppress the evidence. So, the court would decide whether suppression is appropriate. The plain view doctrine allows the officer to seize evidence. So, in this case, the officer's motion is for suppression based on a warrantless search. The plain view doctrine applies because the items were in plain view, and there was a reasonable suspicion that they were stolen.

So, the court should allow the suppression if the plain view doctrine is applicable. Therefore, the correct answer is that suppression will occur. Looking at the options, none explicitly say suppression will occur. Wait, let's re-examine the options.

The options are about whether suppression is allowed or not. So:

Option B says the evidence was properly seized because the officer had a right to investigate further once he had properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances. That's about the entry, but the suppression is about whether the evidence is in plain view.

Wait, the question is whether the court will suppress. So, if the plain view doctrine applies, the suppression should be allowed. So, the correct answer is that suppression will be allowed, which would be option B or another.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: No, the evidence was properly seized because the officer had a right to investigate it further once he had properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances.

Wait, that's about the entry, not the suppression. The suppression is a separate issue.

Another angle: The plain view doctrine requires that the items are in plain view, that the officer had a reasonable suspicion, and that the search was for additional evidence under exigent circumstances.

So, suppression should occur because the plain view doctrine applies.

Looking again at the options, which one states that suppression will occur? Let's check.

Option G: No, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Option G says suppression will occur because it's in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion. But the options are about suppression, so we need to pick if suppression is allowed or not.

Wait, the options are about whether the court will suppress the evidence, not about the reason.

So, the suppression should be allowed because of the plain view doctrine. But which option is that?

Looking at the options:

Option B: No, the evidence was properly seized because the officer had a right to investigate it further once he had properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances.

This is about the entry, which is a valid reason to seek a warrant, but it doesn't address whether suppression is appropriate.

Option G: No, the evidence was subject to further search and seizure because it was in plain view and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that it was contraband.

Wait, that sounds correct. Because the items are in plain view, the officer has a reasonable suspicion, and the search was for additional evidence under exigent circumstances, so suppression should occur.

Therefore, the correct answer is G.
</think>

The question revolves around the suppression of evidence based on the plain view doctrine in a criminal investigation. The items in the apartment were in plain view, and the officer had a reasonable suspicion that they were stolen. The search was for additional evidence under exigent circumstances. According to the plain view doctrine, the officer's motion to suppress evidence should be allowed because the items meet the criteria of being in plain view, the officer had a reasonable suspicion, and the search was for additional evidence under exigent circumstances.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** correctly identifies that suppression should occur because the items were in plain view, the officer had a reasonable suspicion, and the search was for additional evidence under exigent circumstances.
- Other options either fail to address these criteria or misrepresent the reasoning behind suppression.

Thus, the correct answer is **G**.

ANSWER: G
