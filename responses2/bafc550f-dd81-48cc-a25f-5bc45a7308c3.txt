Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that F(3) is 8 and F'(3) is -4. I need to find F(3.02) approximately. The options are A to J, ranging from 7.92 to 8.10, mostly around 8.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with small changes in the input of a function, we can use the linear approximation, which is like the tangent line at a point. The formula is something like F(a + h) ≈ F(a) + h * F'(a). Here, a is 3, and h is the small change in x, which is 3.02 - 3 = 0.02.

So, plugging in the values: F(3 + 0.02) ≈ F(3) + 0.02 * F'(3). That's 8 + 0.02*(-4). Let me compute that. 0.02 times -4 is -0.08. So, 8 - 0.08 equals 7.92. Wait, that's option A. But wait, I thought the answer was 8.02. Did I get the sign right?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. F'(3) is -4, so 0.02 * (-4) is -0.08. So, 8 minus 0.08 is 7.92. So option A is 7.92. But looking at the options, option B is 8.00. Why is that? Did I make a mistake in the sign?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The linear approximation is F(a+h) ≈ F(a) + h * F'(a). So, h is positive, 0.02. F'(a) is -4. So, 0.02 * (-4) is -0.08. So 8 - 0.08 is 7.92. So the correct approximation is 7.92, which is option A. But wait, I'm confused because sometimes when the derivative is negative, the function is decreasing, so moving from 3 to 3.02 (a positive step), the function value should decrease, so F(3) is 8, F(3.02) should be less than 8, so 7.92 is correct. Therefore, option A is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 7.92. But why is there an option B at 8.00? Maybe I should check the formula again. Oh, wait, perhaps I used the correct formula but I'm making a calculation mistake.

Wait, 0.02 * (-4) is -0.08. So 8 -0.08 is 7.92. That's right. So the answer should be A. But another thought: sometimes the approximation is F(a) + h * F'(a), so perhaps I shouldn't be subtracting. Wait no, because F'(a) is -4, so it's a negative slope. So moving to the right by 0.02, the function decreases by 0.08, so 8 -0.08 is 7.92. So yes, the correct answer is 7.92, which is option A.

The correct answer is 7.92, which corresponds to option A.
