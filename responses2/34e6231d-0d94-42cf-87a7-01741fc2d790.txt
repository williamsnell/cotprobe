Okay, so I have this question here about primary colors of light. The options are red, green, blue, and yellow. I need to figure out which one isn't considered a primary color. Hmm, I remember that in the color wheel, the primary colors are usually red, blue, and yellow. Wait, but sometimes it's red, green, and blue. Oh right, sometimes the primary colors are taken as red, yellow, and blue for some art mediums, but in the context of light colors, I think it's red, green, and blue. So, looking at the options, the letters are A: red, B: green, C: blue, D: yellow.

Wait, no, the primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. So yellow isn't a primary color. Oh wait, but sometimes people include yellow as a primary in some contexts. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The standard primary colors in the visible spectrum are red, green, and blue. Yellow is actually a combination of red and blue light, so it wouldn't be a primary color. So in this question, the color not considered a primary would be yellow, which is option D. So the answer should be D.

The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. Yellow is a combination of red and blue light and is not considered a primary color. Therefore, the color not considered a primary color is yellow.

Answer: D
