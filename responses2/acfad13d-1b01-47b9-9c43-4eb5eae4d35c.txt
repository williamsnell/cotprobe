Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how the drought and the cancer discovery affect the equilibrium of pineapples. Let me think through each part step by step.

First, the drought. I know that a drought usually affects the supply of a crop. Droughts can reduce the amount of pineapple that can be grown because it makes the crop less able to bear fruit. So, in terms of supply, the supply curve for pineapples probably shifts to the left. If supply decreases, it means that at any given price, more pineapples are needed. So the supply curve (S) moves left.

Now, what about the discovery that helps avoid cancer? I remember that some environmental or medical research can lead to better health. If the disease (cancer) is being avoided, that would reduce the demand because people are less likely to buy pineapples. So the demand curve (D) would shift to the left as well. Because if people don't need pineapples as much, they'll buy less at any given price.

Wait, or is it the other way around? No, wait, if the disease is avoided, people might consume more. For example, if a common disease is fixed, people are more likely to buy the product. So yes, demand increases—so the demand curve shifts to the right. Because if more people want to buy pineapples, the demand increases, so the demand curve moves to the right.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The discovery that helps avoid cancer means that the disease is less likely. So, people are healthier, so they might consume more. So the demand for pineapples increases. So the demand curve shifts to the right.

Wait, no. Let me think about the law of demand. If the price of pineapples increases, people buy less. If the price decreases, they buy more. So if people are more willing to buy because they've avoided the disease, then the demand increases. So the demand curve moves to the right.

So, to recap: drought reduces supply (shifts S left), and the cancer avoidance increases demand (shifts D right).

Now, how do these shifts affect equilibrium?

In the market, equilibrium is where supply equals demand. So, when supply decreases and demand increases, the equilibrium quantity and price both change.

Let me visualize the supply and demand curves. The supply curve shifts left (S' moves left). The demand curve shifts right (D' moves right).

At the original equilibrium (E), the supply and demand crossed. Now, with S' left and D' right, the new equilibrium is at a new point. Where?

At the new equilibrium, the quantity and price would both change. Let's see: because supply has decreased and demand has increased, the equilibrium quantity will increase. Because the supply is now more limited, so more is needed to meet the same demand. The price will decrease because the increased demand might outstrip the decreased supply.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, let's think about the shifts. When supply decreases, the equilibrium price usually increases because supply is less. But when demand increases, the equilibrium price decreases because demand is higher.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me clarify. Let me think about the shifts.

When supply decreases (S' left), suppose the demand remains the same. The new equilibrium would be at a higher price because the supply is too low. But in this case, demand also increases. So both factors are moving in opposite directions.

So, the initial effect of a leftward supply shift (drought) is to increase the equilibrium price. But the demand shift (cancer avoidance) would cause a decrease in the equilibrium price. So which effect dominates?

Wait, but it's not just a single shift. Both are happening at the same time. So the new equilibrium will have both shifts in play.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the shifts.

Let me think of the shifts on the graph. The original equilibrium is E. Now, supply curve shifts left (S'), and demand curve shifts right (D').

So the new supply is S' (left), new demand is D' (right). The new equilibrium point would be at the intersection of S' and D'.

To determine the direction of the shifts, I can use the concept of movement in the supply and demand curve.

The equilibrium quantity (Q) is determined by the intersection. When S shifts left and D shifts right, the quantity where they meet will increase, and the price will decrease.

Alternatively, sometimes the combined effect can be thought of as the net effect. For example, if the supply decreases more than demand increases, the quantity increases and price decreases. If the demand increases more, price might increase, but quantity decreases.

Wait, perhaps the best way is to think about the possible options and see which fits.

Looking at the options, some options are about quantity increasing or decreasing, and others are about price increasing or decreasing.

We know that with a leftward S and rightward D, the equilibrium quantity will increase (because S is lower, meaning more is needed at each price, and D is higher, so people buy more). The equilibrium price will decrease because the increase in D might dominate the decrease in S.

Wait, but wait, when both S and D shift, the equilibrium could go either way depending on the magnitude of the shifts. But in this question, the two effects are happening simultaneously. So the net effect is that supply decreases and demand increases, leading to an increase in quantity and a decrease in price.

So looking at the options:

Option E: Increases, Increases — probably not, because price decreases.

Option F: Increases, Decreases — this matches our conclusion.

Option G: Indeterminate — probably not, because it's a clear case.

So the correct answer is F: Increases, Decreases.

The drought reduces the supply of pineapples, causing the supply curve to shift left, while the discovery of a cancer-avoiding treatment increases demand, causing the demand curve to shift right. Both events result in an increase in equilibrium quantity and a decrease in equilibrium price.

**Answer: F: Increases, Decreases**
