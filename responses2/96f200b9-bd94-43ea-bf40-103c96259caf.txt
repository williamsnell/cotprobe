Question:

Brown cosigned Royal's $50000 note to State Bank. If Royal is later adjudicated mentally incompetent what would be Brown's liability on the note?

Options:

A: Liable to pay State only if State first seeks payment from Royal.
B: Not liable to pay State as Brown was only a voluntary surety.
C: Liable to pay State only if Royal fails to meet the payment deadline.
D: Not liable to pay State, as Royal's mental incompetency releases all cosigners from liability.
E: Not liable to pay State unless Brown was a compensated surety.
F: Liable to pay State, but only half of the note due to Royal's mental incompetency.
G: Not liable to pay State because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety.
H: Liable to pay State on the due date of the note.
I: Not liable to pay State, as Brown's liability is dependent on Royal's mental competency at the time of signing.
J: Liable to pay State, but only if Royal's assets are insufficient to cover the debt.

Okay, so I have this legal question about suretyship and mental competency. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says Brown signed a note to State Bank with a $50,000 amount. Then, later, Royal gets adjudicated mentally incompetent. I need to determine Brown's liability on the note.

I remember that suretyship involves cosigners (like Brown) who provide coverage for the debt. If a cosigner is unable to meet their obligations, their liability could be affected, especially if there's a situation where the cosigner is deemed mentally incompetent.

Wait, the concept here is about sureship and the conditions under which the surety is liable. I think that suretyship covers a debt as long as the surety can perform their obligations. But if the surety is unable to perform, like being mentally incompetent, does that discharge their liability?

I recall that for sureship, the surety is only liable if they can perform. So, if the surety is mentally incompetent, they might not be able to fulfill their duties, thus making them liable. But wait, in some cases, if a surety is not performing, can they be released from liability?

I think there's a concept called "release of liability" where if the surety cannot perform, they might be released. Like, in some jurisdictions, sureship can be terminated if the surety is unable to perform. But I'm a bit hazy on the exact conditions.

Wait, the possible answers are about whether Brown is liable. So the options are about whether Brown's liability is affected.

Option D says Brown is not liable because the surety's mental competency releases all cosigners. That seems plausible. Because if the surety can't perform, they might be released from liability.

Another angle: when a surety is found mentally incompetent, does that mean they're no longer liable? Or do they still have some duty? I think if the surety can't perform, they lose their liability. So, if Royal is mentally incompetent, Brown's surety duty is discharged. But wait, the question is about Brown's liability. So, if he was a surety, and the surety is mentally incompetent, does that make him liable?

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, in cases of suretyship, if a surety is not performing, the surety can be released. So, in this case, since Royal is mentally incompetent, he's no longer a surety. So Brown isn't liable because he's not a surety anymore.

But wait, no. Wait, the question says Brown signed the note, and Royal is adjudicated mentally incompetent. So, is the suretyship still in effect, or is it terminated?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the general rule. For sureship, if the surety can't perform, they're liable. But if the surety is unable to perform, they might be released from liability. So, if the surety isn't performing, they might be able to discharge their liability.

But I'm not sure if the discharge happens immediately. Or is it that the surety is only liable if they can perform, and if they can't, they're not liable. I think that might be the case.

So, if Royal is unable to perform (mistrustful or incompetent), the surety (Brown) is no longer liable. So in this case, Brown's liability would be zero because he's not a surety anymore.

So looking at the options, which one matches that scenario?

Option D says Brown isn't liable because the surety's competency releases all cosigners. So that aligns with that idea.

Another option is E: not liable unless Brown was compensated. I don't think that's right; sureship doesn't depend on compensation.

Option G says he's not liable because the competency discharges him as surety. That matches.

But wait, another thought. In some cases, when a surety is found mentally incompetent, is the surety automatically released from liability? Or is the surety's liability subject to the jurisdiction's rules?

I think in some jurisdictions, if a surety is found mentally incompetent, they may be released from liability. So Brown wouldn't be liable because he's no longer a surety. So D is correct.

Alternatively, in some states, suretyship doesn't automatically terminate if the surety is unable to perform. So perhaps Brown remains liable.

But I'm more confident that in some cases, the surety is released from liability if they can't perform. So in this case, since Royal is mentally incompetent, Brown isn't liable.

So the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is **D: Not liable to pay State, as Brown was only a voluntary surety**.

Brown signed a note to State Bank and was a surety. However, upon Royal's adjudication of mental incompetence, Brown's liability as a surety may be affected. According to legal principles, if the surety cannot perform their obligations, they may be released from liability. Therefore, Brown is no longer liable to State Bank for the note, as he is not a surety anymore.

Answer: D
