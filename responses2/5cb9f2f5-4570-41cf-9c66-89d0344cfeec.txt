Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to simplify the quotient [2x^0] divided by [(2x)^0]. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that any number raised to the power of zero is 1. So, x^0 should be 1, right? Let me write that down. So the numerator becomes 2 times 1, which is just 2. 

Now, the denominator is (2x)^0. Again, anything to the power of zero is 1, regardless of what's inside the parentheses. So the denominator is 1. 

So now the expression simplifies to 2 divided by 1. Dividing by 1 doesn't change the number, so 2 divided by 1 is just 2. 

Looking at the options, option G is 2. So I think the answer should be G. 

Wait, another thing to check: did I apply the exponent rules correctly? Yes, x^0 is 1, so 2x^0 is 2. And (2x)^0 is 1. So 2/1 is indeed 2. No mistakes there. I don't think I missed anything. So I'm confident the answer is G.

The expression simplifies by recognizing that any non-zero number raised to the power of zero is 1. Thus, the numerator becomes 2 and the denominator becomes 1. Dividing these gives 2, which corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
