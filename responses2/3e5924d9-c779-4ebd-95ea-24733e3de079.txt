Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about marketing functions, and I need to figure out which one is not a marketing function under the British Government. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, let me recall what marketing functions typically include. From what I remember, marketing involves several key areas like creating campaigns, organizing events, promoting intelligence, developing sales tactics, pricing strategies, working with other functions, conducting research, developing the product proposal, managing customer relationships, and overseeing product development.

Looking at the options, the question is asking which one is not a function. So, I need to check each option against these functions.

Option A: Create advertising campaigns. That sounds like a marketing function. Definitely included.

Option B: Organize marketing events. Also a function. Yes, that's part of marketing.

Option C: Promote marketing intelligence. Hmm, marketing intelligence usually refers to data and tools that help businesses make decisions. But in some contexts, promoting intelligence might involve training people on how to use that data, not just the intelligence itself. I'm a bit fuzzy here, but I think it's more about supporting marketing rather than being a function of marketing.

Option D: Develop sales tactics. That's a marketing function, I believe. Sales tactics are about strategies to increase sales, so yes.

Option E: Develop pricing strategies. Pricing is a key part of marketing, so this is definitely a function.

Option F: Work with other business functions and third parties. That's about collaboration, which is part of marketing functions.

Option G: Conduct market research. This is another marketing function, as it's about gathering data to inform marketing decisions.

Option H: Develop the customer proposition. The customer proposition is the idea or message you're trying to sell to your target audience. That's part of marketing, so yes.

Option I: Oversee product development. That sounds like product development is part of the business functions, but is it a marketing function? I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about product strategy, which falls under business functions but not directly under marketing itself.

Option J: Manage customer relationships. Managing customer relations is definitely a marketing function, as it's about understanding and interacting with customers to improve their experience.

Wait, so the question is which is NOT a marketing function. Let me re-examine each option.

Option C: Promoting marketing intelligence. Marketing intelligence is more about data and tools, not the intelligence itself. So promoting it might be a function, but perhaps the term is used differently. Alternatively, maybe it's considered part of marketing because it's about leveraging marketing data.

Alternatively, maybe the term "promote marketing intelligence" is misleading. If "promoting" is about supporting marketing efforts, then maybe it's a function. But sometimes, it's more about the act of presenting the intelligence, which might not be purely a function.

Wait, another approach: what are the standard marketing functions? From what I recall, marketing functions include creating campaigns, organizing events, promoting products, developing sales tactics, pricing, collaborating, market research, developing the product, managing customer relationships, and developing the product proposal. 

If the options are A to J, looking for the one not in this list.

Wait, another thought: "Developing sales tactics" (D) is definitely part of marketing. "Pricing strategies" (E) is a function too. "Oversee product development" (I) is a business function, but is it a marketing function? Or is it a business strategy function.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a marketing function. So, if "Oversee product development" is a business function, not specifically marketing, then it's not a marketing function. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe "Oversee product development" is part of the marketing process, especially if it's about developing the product in a way that's part of marketing strategy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the options.

The options that are marketing functions are A, B, D, E, F, G, H, J. What about C and I?

I think option I is oversee product development, which is a business function, not a marketing function. So the correct answer would be I.
</think>

The correct answer is I: Oversee product development.

**Explanation:**
Option I refers to overseeing product development, which is a business function rather than a marketing function. Marketing functions include creating campaigns, organizing events, promoting intelligence, developing sales tactics, pricing strategies, collaborating with other business functions, conducting market research, developing the customer proposition, and managing customer relationships. Overseeing product development falls under business strategy, not marketing.
