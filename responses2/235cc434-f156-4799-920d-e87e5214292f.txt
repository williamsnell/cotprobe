Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a thinplano-convex lens. Hmm, I remember that thin lenses have some specific formulas, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's see. The question says the refractive power is 20 diopters. Wait, refractive power is the reciprocal of the focal length, right? So if the power (in diopters) is P, then f = 1/P. So in this case, f would be 1/20 meters, which is 0.05 meters or 5 cm. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 20 diopters is 20 m⁻¹. So f = 1/20 m. Which is 0.05 m, which is 5 cm. But wait, that's the focal length in air, I think. Because the lens is made of glass, but the refractive index is given, so maybe I need to account for that.

Wait, the formula for a thin lens assumes the lens is made of a material with refractive index n. The formula for the focal length of a thin lens is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2). But wait, for a plano-convex lens, one surface is flat. So one of the radii is infinite, right? Because a flat surface means R is infinity, so 1/R is zero. So the formula simplifies to 1/f = (n-1)(1/R + 0) => 1/f = (n-1)(1/R). So solving for R: R = (n-1) / (1/f).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me recheck. The general formula for a thin lens (assuming it's thin) is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2). But when one surface is flat, R2 is infinity, so 1/R2 is zero. So 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1). So R1 = (n-1) * f.

Wait, but wait another thing. The formula might be 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2), but since R2 is infinity, 1/R2 is zero. So 1/f = (n-1)/R1. So R1 = (n-1)*f. But wait, in this case, one of the surfaces is a plane, so R2 is infinite. So the formula simplifies, yes.

Wait, but wait, I think I may have gotten that wrong. Wait, the standard formula for a thin lens where one surface is curved (convex) and the other is flat is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R). So f is the focal length, and R is the radius of the curved surface.

So in this problem, the lens is made of glass with index n=1.5. The power is 20 diopters, so f = 1/20 m = 0.05 m. So R = (n-1)/f. So n=1.5, so n-1=0.5. R= 0.5 / 0.05 m = 10 m. Wait, but that's 10 meters. That can't be right because the options are in centimeters. Hmm, did I mess up something?

Wait, wait, I'm probably mixing up the units here. Let me think again. The focal length f is in meters when using SI units. So 20 diopters equals 20 m⁻¹, so f is 1/20 meters, which is 0.05 meters, 5 cm. Wait, but wait, the calculation earlier was R = (n-1)/f. So n-1 is 0.5. f is 0.05 m. So R = 0.5 / 0.05 = 10 meters. But that's 10 meters, which is way too big. None of the options are that big.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. Oh wait, I think I mixed up whether R is positive or negative. Or perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). Wait, no, that's for another scenario. Wait, in the thin lens formula, 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2), but when R2 is infinite, it's (n-1)(1/R1). Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm getting the sign wrong. Let me consider the conventions. For a convex lens, R1 is positive, I think. So for a plano-convex lens, R2 is negative, because the surface is flat and facing the opposite direction. Wait, no, the other way around. Wait, for a plano-convex lens, the curved surface is R1 positive, and the flat surface is R2 negative, because the flat side is considered as a radius going to negative infinity. So 1/R2 would be zero. So 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 0). So 1/f = (n-1)/R1 => R1 = (n-1) * f.

Wait, but again, f is 0.05 m, so R1 = 0.5 / 0.05 = 10 meters. But the options are much smaller. Hmm, that can't be right. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The focal length of a thin lens in air is given by the lensmaker's equation. The formula for a plano-convex lens (convex side and flat side) is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R), where R is the radius of the curved surface. Yes, but wait, R is positive if the lens is converging. So 1/f = (n-1)/R. So R = (n-1)*f.

Wait, but in this case, f is 0.05 m. So R would be 0.5 / 0.05 = 10 m. But that's way beyond the options. The options are much smaller, like 5 cm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the lens is made of something else, but no, the question says it's glass with index 1.5.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the focal length calculation. The power is 20 diopters, which is 20 m⁻¹. So f is 1/20 m = 0.05 m, which is 5 cm.

But according to the formula, R is (n-1)*f = 0.5 * 0.05 m = 0.025 m, which is 2.5 cm. That matches option C.

Ah, so that must be the correct answer. So I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation. Oh! Wait, perhaps I should have considered f in centimeters instead of meters? Because 0.05 meters is 5 cm, which is 50 mm, but when using the formula, if f is in meters, 0.05 m is correct. But wait, another way: suppose I calculate using units in centimeters.

Wait, let's try. If the focal length f is 5 cm, then R = (n-1) * f. So n is 1.5, so n-1 = 0.5. Multiply by 5 cm: 0.5 *5 = 2.5 cm. So R is 2.5 cm, which is option C, which is one of the choices.

So that makes sense. So the radius of curvature is 2.5 cm, which is option C.

The problem involves finding the radius of curvature of a thinplano-convex lens made of glass with a refractive index of 1.5, given that its refractive power is 20 diopters. The refractive power \( P \) is related to the focal length \( f \) by \( P = \frac{1}{f} \). For a thin lens, the focal length is given by the lensmaker's equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right),
\]

where \( n \) is the refractive index of the lens material, \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the radii of the curved surfaces. In this case, the lens is plano-convex, meaning one surface is flat (\( R_2 = \infty \), so \( \frac{1}{R_2} = 0 \)). The simplified formula becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \frac{1}{R_1}.
\]

Rearranging for \( R_1 \):

\[
R_1 = \frac{(n-1)}{f}.
\]

The refractive power \( P \) is given as 20 diopters, so:

\[
f = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{20 \, \text{diopters}} = 0.05 \, \text{m} = 5 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Substituting \( n = 1.5 \) and \( f = 5 \, \text{cm} \) into the formula for \( R_1 \):

\[
R_1 = \frac{(1.5 - 1)}{5 \, \text{cm}} = \frac{0.5}{5 \, \text{cm}} = 0.1 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{cm}.
\]

However, this result does not match the options provided. Reconsidering the calculation in centimeters:

\[
R_1 = (n-1) \cdot f = 0.5 \cdot 5 \, \text{cm} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}.
\]

This matches option C. Thus, the radius of curvature of the curved surface of the lens is 2.5 cm.
