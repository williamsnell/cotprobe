Question:

Each student that enrolls at a school is assigned a unique ID number, which is stored as a binary number. The ID numbers increase sequentially by 1 with each newly enrolled student. If the ID number assigned to the last student who enrolled was the binary number 1001 0011, what binary number will be assigned to the next student who enrolls?

Options:

A: 1001 0110
B: 1101 0100
C: 1001 0101
D: 1101 0111
E: 1001 1000
F: 1001 0010
G: 1001 0100
H: 1001 0111
I: 1101 0011
J: 1011 0100

Okay, so I've got this question about binary numbers and student IDs. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says each student has a unique ID, which is a binary number. The IDs increase sequentially by 1 each time a new student enrolls. The last student's ID is given as 1001 0011. I need to find out what the next ID would be. The options are A to J, each a 8-bit binary number.

Hmm, binary numbers can be a bit tricky when you're not used to them. So let's break it down. The last ID is 10010011. Wait, that's an 8-bit number. Let me convert it to decimal to get a better sense. 

So, each bit represents a power of 2, starting from the right. So:

The rightmost bit is 2^0 = 1. Next is 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, and 2^7=128.

Breaking down 10010011:

1*(128) + 0*(64) + 0*(32) + 1*(16) + 0*(8) + 0*(4) + 1*(2) + 1*(1)
= 128 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 147.

So the last student's ID is 147 in decimal. The next ID would be 147 + 1 = 148.

Wait, but let me think about how adding 1 affects the binary number. When you add 1 to a binary number, you flip the trailing 1s to 0s and the first 0 you encounter becomes 1. So if the last bit is 1, adding 1 turns it into 0 and carries over. If it's 0, then it's just 1.

In this case, the last student's ID is 10010011. Let's add 1 to this. Starting from the right:

1. The rightmost bit is 1. Add 1, becomes 0. No carry-over.
Wait, no, because 147 is even or odd? 147 is odd, so the last bit is 1. So adding 1 gives 0 and carry over from the previous bits.

Wait, maybe an example would help. Let's take a smaller example. Let's say the last student's ID was 1001 (9 in decimal). Adding 1 would make it 1010 (10). So binary numbers: 9 is 1001, next is 1010.

So for 147, adding 1 would change the last 1 to 0 and carry over. Let me think about how that would look.

Let me write 147 in binary:

We know 147 is 10010011.

Adding 1:

10010011
+     1
= ?

Starting from the least significant bit:

1st bit: 1 + 1 = 0, carryover 1.
2nd bit: 1 + 1 (carry) = 0, carryover 1.
3rd bit: 0 + 1 (carry) = 1, no carryover.
Wait, wait, wait, perhaps I should break it down more carefully.

Wait, 147 in binary is 2^7 is 128, 2^6 is 64, 2^5 is 32, 2^4 is 16, 2^3 is 8, 2^2 is 4, 2^1 is 2, 2^0 is 1.

So:

128 (1), 64 (0), 32 (0), 16 (1), 8 (0), 4 (0), 2 (1), 1 (1). So 10010011.

Adding 1:

The rightmost bit is 1. So 1 +1 = 0, carry 1.

Next bit (second from right) is 1. Adding 1 plus carry 1 is 0, carry 1.

Third bit (third from right) is 0. Adding 1 and carry 1: 0 +1 +1 = 10, so set to 0, carry 1.

Fourth bit is 1: 1 + 1 (carry) = 10, set to 0, carry 1.

Fifth bit: 0 +1 (carry) =1, no carry.

Sixth bit: 0 +0 (no carry) =0.

Seventh bit:0 +0 (no carry)=0.

Eighth bit:1 +0 (no carry) =1.

So the new binary number is 10010011 +1 = 10010100.

Wait, let me verify that: 

128 + 64 is 192. So 10010011 is 128+32+16+2+1= 128+ (32+16 is 48) +3= 179? Wait no, wait wait, 128+64 is 192, plus 16 is 208, plus 2 is 210, plus 1 is 211. Wait, but 147 is 10010011. Let me compute 10010011 binary:

128 + 0 +0 +16 + 0 +0 +2 +1 = 128+16+2+1=147.

Wait, but adding 1 to 10010011 would make it 10010100. Let me compute that:

128 + 64 + 0 + 16 +0 +4 +0 +0 = 128+64=192, 16 is 208, 4 is 212. Wait, but 10010100 is 148 in decimal. Oh, so 147+1=148.

So the next ID should be 148, which is 10010100 in binary.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which option is 10010100.

Looking at the options:

A:10010110  
B:11010100  
C:10010101  
D:11010111  
E:10011000  
F:10010010  
G:10010100  
H:10010111  
I:11010011  
J:10110100  

So option G is 10010100, which matches what I calculated. So the next student's ID is G.
</think>

The last student's ID is 10010011, which is 147 in decimal. Adding 1 to this gives 148. Converting 148 back to binary results in 10010100. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is G: 10010100.

Answer: G
