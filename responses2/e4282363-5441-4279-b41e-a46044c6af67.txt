Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about what happens to the orbits of the planets if the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the Schwarzschild radius is a concept related to black holes. The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light. Oh wait, but in this problem, the black hole has the same mass as the Sun. So, the Schwarzschild radius would actually be the same as the Sun's. Wait, the question says the Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m for the black hole. Oh wait, no, the problem says "the Schwarzschild radius of 3000 m." Wait, wait, no, the question says that the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass. Oh wait, no, the question says the Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m. So the black hole's R_s is 3000 m. Hmm, but if the black hole has the same mass as the Sun, what's its Schwarzschild radius? Let me calculate. 

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. The Schwarzschild radius for the Sun is about 3 km. Because the Sun is about 1.989e30 kg. Let me imagine plugging that into the formula. R_s = 2 * G * M / c². Let me find the Sun's Schwarzschild radius. If I recall, the Sun's radius is about 7e5 meters (700,000 m) or about 700 km. Oh, wait, but the Schwarzschild radius is smaller than the radius. So R_s is about 3 km. So in the question, the black hole has R_s of 3000 m (3 km), same as the Sun. So the black hole is a black hole with the same mass as the Sun.

Wait, but the question says the black hole has a Schwarzschild radius of 3000 m. So the mass is such that R_s is 3000 m. Wait, but the problem is saying that the black hole has the same mass as the Sun, right? Oh wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me read again: "the Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m." So the black hole's R_s is 3000 m. But the question says "the black hole of the same mass." So the mass would be such that the Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m. So in reality, the black hole would be much smaller than the Sun, because the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole is much smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of a star of same mass. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole is given by R_s = 2GM/c². For the Sun, R_s is about 3 km. But a black hole that has the Sun's mass would have R_s of 3 km. So if the black hole has the same mass as the Sun, then R_s is 3 km. But in the problem, the Schwarzschild radius is given as 3000 m, which is 3 km. So that's the same as the Sun's R_s. Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem says that if the Sun were replaced by this black hole, its Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m. So the black hole has a smaller Schwarzschild radius than the Sun. Because the Sun's R_s is about 3 km. So this black hole is a black hole with a smaller radius than the Sun. So imagine a black hole that is much more compact than the Sun.

But the question is, what happens to the orbits of the planets if the Sun is replaced by this black hole?

Wait, but the black hole is not a star anymore. So it's a black hole. So, the question is about what would happen to the orbits of the planets if the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass. Oh wait, wait, the question says, the Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m. Wait, if the black hole's Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m, and it's a black hole (non-star), what's that mean?

Wait, the black hole's size is determined by its Schwarzschild radius. But the size of a black hole is more about how much mass it has and its density. So a smaller Schwarzschild radius doesn't directly translate to a smaller size. A black hole with a Schwarzschild radius of 3 km would have a mass of 3 km * c²/(2G), which is the same as for a star of the same mass. Wait, no. Wait, for the Sun, R_s = 2GM/c². So for M = the Sun's mass, R_s is 3 km. So a black hole with R_s = 3000 m (3 km) must have a mass of the same as the Sun, but wait that doesn't make sense because a black hole can't have the same mass as the Sun without having a different radius. Because the Schwarzschild radius is a function of mass. So, if a black hole has the same mass as the Sun, it must have a smaller Schwarzschild radius. So if the given R_s is 3000 m, that would imply that the black hole has a lower mass than the Sun. Because the Schwarzschild radius is proportional to mass.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The Schwarzschild radius for a black hole is given by R_s = 2GM/c². So if M is the same as the Sun, R_s is 3 km. But if a black hole has R_s of 3000 m (3 km), then M would be (R_s c²)/(2G) = (3000 * c²)/(2 G). But wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because for the same M, the black hole's R_s is smaller. So if a black hole has R_s of 3 km, it must have a smaller mass than the Sun. Because the formula says R_s = 2GM/c². So the same object wouldn't have the same R_s. I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's rephrase. The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the event horizon of a black hole. It's the radius beyond which nothing can escape. For a black hole of mass M, R_s = 2GM/c². So if M is the same as the Sun, R_s is 3 km. So a black hole with R_s of 3 km would have the same mass as the Sun. But wait, that can't be possible because a black hole must have a smaller radius than that of the non-black hole object of the same mass. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The Schwarzschild radius for a star like the Sun is about 3 km. For a black hole with the same mass, the Schwarzschild radius would actually be the same? No, wait, no. Because the formula R_s is for a black hole. So if a black hole has the same mass as the Sun, then R_s would be 3 km. So a black hole with the same mass as the Sun has R_s of 3 km. But if the black hole had a smaller R_s, that would imply a smaller mass, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct. The problem says: "the Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m." So if the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass, that can't happen because the Schwarzschild radius would be smaller. So maybe the question actually means that the black hole has R_s of 3000 m, which would correspond to a black hole with a smaller mass than the Sun. Because for the same mass, the Schwarzschild radius is smaller.

But the question says, "the Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m". So perhaps the black hole has R_s = 3000 m. But wait, a black hole can't have the same mass as the Sun and a smaller Schwarzschild radius. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: "If the Sun were suddenly replaced by a black hole of the same mass, it would have a Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m." Wait, that can't be possible because a black hole of the same mass as the Sun would have a Schwarzschild radius of 3 km (3000 meters). So R_s = 3000 m would imply a black hole with a smaller mass than the Sun, because for a black hole, R_s is 2GM/c². So if R_s is 3000 m, then M = (R_s c²)/(2 G) = (3000 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 ) / (2 * 6.67e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2 )

Wait let me calculate that:

R_s = 3000 m = 3e3 m.

M = (3e3 m * (9e16 m²/s²)) / (2 * 6.67e-11 m³/kg/s² )

So M = (3e3 * 9e16) / (2 *6.67e-11) ) kg.

Calculate numerator: 3e3 *9e16 = 27e19 = 2.7e20.

Denominator: 2 *6.67e-11 = 1.334e-10.

So M = 2.7e20 / 1.334e-10 = approx 2e30 kg.

Wait, the Sun's mass is about 1.989e30 kg, so this black hole would be about 50 times less massive than the Sun. Oh, so a black hole of the same mass as the Sun would have R_s of 3 km. But the question says the Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m, which is 3 km, same as the Sun's. So that would imply that the black hole has a smaller mass than the Sun, because R_s = 2GM/c², so for a smaller M, R_s is smaller. So if R_s is 3 km, that's 3000 m, so the black hole's mass is smaller than the Sun.

Wait, but the question says "the Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m". So does that mean the black hole is a smaller black hole than the Sun, but with the same mass as the Sun? No, that can't be. The mass is the same, so the Schwarzschild radius would be smaller. So I'm confused. Maybe the question is correct, and the black hole has a smaller mass than the Sun, so R_s is 3 km (3000 m).

But when the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass, what's the effect on the orbits of the planets? Wait, the question is the opposite: the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass. So if the Sun's mass is M, then the black hole has mass M.

Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius for the black hole is given as 3000 m, so R_s = 3000 m. But R_s = 2GM/c². So M = (R_s c²)/(2 G). So M = (3e3 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 )/(2 *6.67e-11 m³/kg/s² )

Wait, same calculation as before, which gives M ≈ 2e30 kg. The Sun's mass is approximately 1.989e30 kg. So this black hole is about (2e30)/(1.989e30) ≈ 1.0055 times the mass of the Sun. Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me recompute.

Wait, if R_s = 3000 m, then M = (R_s c²)/(2 G) = (3e3 m * (9e16 m²/s²)) / (2 * 6.67e-11 m³/kg/s² )

= (2.7e20) / (1.334e-10) ) kg

= approx 2.025e30 kg.

The Sun's mass is about 1.989e30 kg. So the black hole's mass is approximately 1.02 times the Sun's mass. Wait, that's a bit more than the Sun's mass.

Wait, but wait, a black hole with mass M must have a Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2GM/c². So if M is 1.02 Msun, then R_s would be 2 * 1.02 *6.67e-11 * 3e8 / (3e8)^2? Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

But wait, the point is, what happens to the orbits of the planets when the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass (so same mass as Sun). Black holes have different orbital dynamics, unlike stars.

Wait, the question is asking: if the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass, what effect would that have on the orbits of the planets?

So, the Sun's mass is M, the black hole's mass is M (same as Sun). But the black hole's Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m, which is smaller than the Sun's, so it's a smaller black hole.

Wait, no. Wait, R_s = 2GM/c². So if M is same as the Sun, R_s of the black hole is 3000 m. That's smaller than the Sun's R_s of 3 km. So black hole's R_s is smaller, which makes sense because a smaller mass would have a smaller Schwarzschild radius.

But wait, the question says the black hole has a Schwarzschild radius of 3000 m. So it's a larger black hole than the Sun? Because the Sun's R_s is 3 km, so a larger black hole would have a larger R_s. Wait, no, wait. The Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to mass. So the larger the mass, the larger the R_s. So if a black hole has a larger R_s than the Sun, it's a larger black hole than the Sun, but the problem says R_s is 3000 m. So the black hole would have a larger mass than the Sun, but wait no, because the question says the black hole has the same mass as the Sun, so R_s should be 3 km. But the problem says R_s is 3000 m. So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, but I have to proceed with it as given.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the Schwarzschild radius and its effect on orbital mechanics. The Schwarzschild radius is the radius within which the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. So any object with a radius smaller than the Schwarzschild radius cannot exist as a stable object.

But when the Sun is replaced by a black hole, which is a hole, its gravitational field is much stronger. But wait, no, the black hole is just a region with a strong gravitational field, not a planet anymore.

So the planets would orbit the black hole. The question is, how would their orbits change compared to the Sun's.

In the case of the Sun, the gravitational force is what keeps the planets in orbit. For the black hole, the gravitational force is much stronger, but the black hole is much smaller than the Sun.

Wait, but wait, the black hole's radius is smaller than the Sun's, right? Because if the Schwarzschild radius is 3000 m, that's much smaller than the Sun's 3 km. So the black hole is much smaller in size than the Sun.

So if the Sun is replaced by a black hole, the gravitational field is much stronger because the black hole's mass is the same, but the radius is smaller. But wait, the Schwarzschild radius is determined by the mass. So same mass as the Sun, so same R_s.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me get this straight: black holes are more compact than stars of the same mass. So a black hole with the same mass as the Sun would have a much smaller radius than the Sun.

But the problem says the black hole has a Schwarzschild radius of 3000 m, which is smaller than the Sun's 3 km. So in that case, the black hole is a smaller black hole than the Sun.

So, in the Sun's case, the planets are in their orbits around the Sun. In the black hole case, the planets would orbit the black hole. Since the black hole is much smaller than the Sun, the distance between the black hole and the planets would be smaller.

Wait, but wait, the Schwarzschild radius is a function of mass, not radius. So the size of the black hole is determined by its density. A black hole with the same mass as the Sun but smaller R_s is more dense.

So, the black hole is much smaller than the Sun. So, the size of the black hole is much smaller, so the planets would orbit it in a much smaller area. So, the orbital radius (the distance from the black hole to the planet) would be much smaller. 

Wait, but what effect would that have on the orbits of the planets? Let's think in terms of orbital mechanics. The gravitational force is F = G M m / r², where r is the distance between the two masses. For the planets to orbit the black hole, the distance would be much smaller.

But the orbital period (the time it takes to orbit) depends on the mass of the central body and the distance. The formula for the orbital period is T = 2π√(r³/(G M)).

Wait, in this case, M is the mass of the black hole, which is same as the Sun. So M is the same as the Sun's mass. The radius r is the distance from the black hole to the planet.

Wait, but in the black hole case, the planets are in a much smaller r. So let's compare the orbital periods.

The formula is T = 2π√(r^3/(G M)). So if r is smaller, then r^3 is smaller, and the denominator is smaller, so T is smaller.

So if the black hole's radius is smaller, the orbital period would be shorter. So the planets would orbit the black hole much faster, in much shorter times (days, weeks, etc.).

Wait, but we're talking about the effect on the orbits of the planets. So if the black hole is much smaller in radius, the planets would be orbiting it much closer. But what effect would that have on their orbits?

Wait, the planets would now be in a much smaller orbit. So the orbital radius is much smaller, but the orbital period is much shorter. So the orbital period would be much shorter, meaning the planets would complete their orbits much faster than they would in the solar system.

Wait, but that's if the black hole is a point mass. But in reality, the black hole's radius is much smaller, but for the purposes of orbital mechanics, the potential is dominated by the distance from the central mass.

Wait, perhaps the effect is that the planets would have a much shorter orbital period, meaning they orbit faster. So the time it would take for the planets to orbit the black hole would be much shorter, in days instead of years.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Let me think again. The gravitational force is F = G M m /r². The centripetal force needed is F = m v² /r. Substituting v = 2πr/T, we get F = (4 π² m r)/T².

So equating, G M m / r² = (4 π² m r)/T².

Simplify: G M / r³ = 4 π² r / T².

Multiply both sides by T²: G M T² / r³ = 4 π² r.

Multiply both sides by r³: G M T² = 4 π² r^4.

So T² = (4 π² r^4 )/(G M).

So T = 2 π r² / sqrt(G M).

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me recompute.

Wait, the equation is:

G M m / r² = (4 π² m r) / T².

Cancel m:

G M / r² = 4 π² r / T².

Multiply both sides by T²:

G M T² / r² = 4 π² r.

Multiply both sides by r²:

G M T² = 4 π² r^3.

So T² = (4 π² r^3)/(G M).

Take square root:

T = 2 π r^(3/2) / sqrt( G M )

Wait, that still doesn't make sense. Let me think about the standard formula. The orbital period is given by T = 2π sqrt(r^3/(G M)).

Wait, so in this case, the formula would be T = 2π sqrt(r^3/(G M)).

Which is correct.

So in the case of the Sun, M = M_sun, and r is the orbital radius.

So, for the black hole, M is same as the Sun's mass, and r is the orbital radius around the black hole.

So, the orbital period of the planets around the black hole would be T = 2π sqrt(r^3/(G M)).

Wait, but in the Sun's case, the orbital period is T_sun = 2π sqrt(r^3/(G M_sun)).

So, the ratio of T_planet to T_sun is T_planet / T_sun = sqrt(r_planet^3/(r_sun^3)).

Because M is same.

Wait, so T_planet = T_sun * sqrt( (r_planet / r_sun)^3 ) = T_sun * (r_planet / r_sun)^(3/2).

So, if the orbital radius of the planets around the black hole is much smaller than the orbital radius around the Sun, then T_planet would be much smaller than T_sun.

Wait, the black hole's orbital radius is r_bh, and the Sun's is r_sun.

But the problem is, the black hole is much smaller than the Sun. So, the orbital radius of the planets would be much smaller than the orbital radius of the Sun.

Wait, but the problem is, what effect would that have. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:

A. The planets would orbit the black hole for a much longer time.

B. The planets would orbit the black hole much faster.

C. The black hole would not be able to have planets.

D. The black hole would be destroyed.

Wait, but in the case of a black hole, the event horizon is an event that can't exist. So the Sun is replaced by a black hole. The planets would orbit the black hole. But if the black hole is much smaller than the Sun, the orbital radius is much smaller. So the time it takes to orbit is shorter.

So the orbital period would be shorter, meaning the planets orbit faster.

So option B is the correct answer.

But wait, the problem is, if the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass, what's the effect on the orbits of the planets. Wait, when the Sun is replaced by a black hole, the black hole is a much smaller object, so the orbital radius of the planets is much smaller. The orbital period is shorter, so the planets orbit faster.

So the correct answer is B: The planets would orbit the black hole much faster.

Wait, but what about the options given? Let me check.

The options are A, B, C, D.

So, for the answer, the correct option is B.

Another consideration: the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole is 3000 m, which is much smaller than the Sun's 3 km. So the black hole is a much smaller object. The orbital radius of the planets would be much smaller, leading to shorter orbital periods. So the planets would orbit the black hole much faster than they would in the solar system.

Wait, but the original question is about the Sun being replaced by a black hole of the same mass. So I think the reasoning is correct, and the effect is that the planets orbit the black hole much faster.

So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The question involves replacing the Sun with a black hole of the same mass and analyzing the effect on the orbits of the planets. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Schwarzschild Radius**:  
   The Schwarzschild radius is the radius within which a massive object cannot exist as a stable object. For a black hole, the Schwarzschild radius is given by \( R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \). For the black hole in question, \( R_s = 3000 \, \text{m} \), which is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun (\( R_s = 3 \, \text{km} \)).

2. **Orbital Radius of Planets**:  
   The planets currently orbit the Sun in a larger radius. If the Sun is replaced by a black hole, the orbital radius of the planets would be much smaller, as the black hole is much smaller than the Sun.

3. **Orbital Period**:  
   The orbital period of the planets is the time they take to complete one orbit. For a given orbital radius \( r \), the orbital period \( T \) is determined by the formula:  
   \[
   T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}
   \]  
   Since the black hole has the same mass as the Sun (\( M = M_{\odot} \)), the only difference in the orbital period comes from the orbital radius \( r \). A smaller orbital radius results in a shorter orbital period, meaning the planets orbit faster.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **A. The planets would orbit the black hole for a much longer time**: Incorrect. A shorter orbital period means the planets orbit faster, not longer.  
   - **B. The planets would orbit the black hole much faster**: Correct. The shorter orbital period means the planets orbit faster.  
   - **C. The black hole would not be able to have planets**: Incorrect. A black hole can have planets, but the orbital radius is much smaller than in the case of a stellar object like the Sun.  
   - **D. The black hole would be destroyed**: Incorrect. A black hole can exist without being destroyed, especially with a large enough mass.

**Conclusion**:  
If the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the planets would orbit the black hole much faster, as the shorter orbital period compensates for the much smaller orbital radius of the planets.

ANSWER: B
