Alright, so I've got this problem here about calculating the target selling price for a new product, Duct. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question says that the target contribution margin is 20%. I remember that contribution margin is the revenue minus variable costs, and it's used to cover fixed costs and then make a profit. But wait, what exactly is the target contribution margin here? Oh, right, it's the minimum contribution needed to meet the target. So, I think the formula for target selling price when you have a target contribution margin would involve the target margin percentage and the variable costs.

The unit costs given are a bit detailed. Let me list them out:

- Manufacturing costs: Variable $12, Fixed $8
- Selling & Admin. Costs: Variable $3, Fixed $5

So, I need to calculate the total variable cost and the total fixed cost, then add them up to get the total variable cost per unit. Then, apply the target contribution margin to this to find the contribution, which is revenue minus total variable cost. From there, I can find the selling price.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The contribution margin is (Selling Price - Total Variable Cost). So, if the target contribution margin is 20%, then the contribution needed is 20% of the selling price. But wait, actually, contribution margin is the margin that covers fixed costs and profit. So, the target contribution is the minimum required, which is 20% of the selling price. Hmm, but maybe the question is just using 20% as the target contribution margin, meaning that the contribution should be at least 20% of the selling price. Alternatively, perhaps it's the target profit after covering fixed costs. I'm a bit confused about that. Let me read the question again.

Oh, the question states "target contribution margin is set for Duct." So, I think the target is such that it's the minimum required contribution. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the term "target selling price" with a 20% contribution margin. Wait, maybe I should approach this correctly.

The formula for target selling price when a target contribution margin is desired is:

Selling Price = (Total Variable Cost + Total Fixed Cost) / (1 - (Target CM / 100))

Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right formula. Alternatively, the contribution margin is equal to (Selling Price - Variable Costs). So, if the target contribution is 20% of the selling price, then:

Contribution = 20% of SP = SP * 0.20

But also, Contribution = SP - Variable Costs. So:

SP * 0.20 = SP - Variable Costs

Which I can rearrange:

0.20 SP = SP - Variable Costs
=> Variable Costs = SP - 0.20 SP
=> Variable Costs = 0.80 SP

Wait, that can't be right because Variable Costs are part of SP. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me try solving it properly.

Let me define:

Total Variable Cost per unit = Variable manufacturing cost + Variable selling/admin. cost = $12 + $3 = $15.

Total Fixed Cost per unit = Fixed manufacturing cost + Fixed selling/admin. cost = $8 + $5 = $13.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. The target contribution margin is 20%, so that is the margin required as a percentage of SP. So:

Target Contribution = SP - Total Variable Cost = SP * 20% = 0.20 SP

So,

0.20 SP = SP - (Total Variable Cost + Total Fixed Cost?)

Wait, no. Wait, SP is the selling price. The contribution is SP minus all variable and fixed costs. Wait, no, the contribution is SP minus variable costs. Fixed costs are separate; they are expenses to cover, not part of the contribution. So, the contribution is SP minus variable costs.

So, if the target contribution margin is 20%, then:

20% of SP must be equal to (SP - Variable Costs). So,

0.20 * SP = SP - Variable Costs

Let me plug in the numbers:

0.20 SP = SP - (15) 

Wait, no, wait. SP is selling price, and SP - Variable Costs is the contribution. So:

SP - 15 = 0.20 SP

Moving terms:

SP - 0.20 SP = 15

0.80 SP = 15

So, SP = 15 / 0.80 = 18.75.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. So, SP is 18.75, then the contribution is 0.20 * 18.75 = $3.75. But SP - Variable Cost is 18.75 - 15 = 3.75, which matches. So, yes, that seems right.

So, the target selling price is $18.75.

Looking at the options, option A is $18.75, so that's the answer.
</think>

The target selling price is calculated using the formula:

Selling Price = (Total Variable Cost + Total Fixed Cost) / (1 - (Target Contribution Margin / 100))

Where:
- Total Variable Cost = $12 (manufacturing) + $3 (selling/admin.) = $15
- Total Fixed Cost = $8 (manufacturing) + $5 (selling/admin.) = $13
- Target Contribution Margin = 20%

Substituting the values:

Selling Price = ($15 + $13) / (1 - 0.20) = $28 / 0.80 = $35.

Wait, this contradicts the earlier calculation. Let me re-examine the approach.

Alternatively, the correct formula when the target contribution margin is a percentage of selling price is:

Contribution Margin = SP Ã— (1 - Target CM%) = SP - Variable Costs

Given that Contribution Margin = 20% of SP:

0.20 SP = SP - 15

0.20 SP = SP - 15  
0.80 SP = 15  
SP = 15 / 0.80 = $18.75

Thus, the target selling price is $18.75, which corresponds to option A.
