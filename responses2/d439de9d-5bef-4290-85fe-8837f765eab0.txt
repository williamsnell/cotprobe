Question:

A previously healthy 24-year-old woman who is a college student comes to the office because of a 6-month history of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation. The symptoms are more severe when she is preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements. She takes no medications. She does not smoke or use illicit drugs. She drinks alcoholic beverages occasionally. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 100/72 mm Hg. Physical examination, including digital rectal examination, shows no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A urease breath test result is negative. Upper and lower endoscopies show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

Options:

A: Prednisolone
B: Omeprazole
C: Azathioprine
D: Lubiprostone
E: Loperamide
F: Infliximab
G: Metronidazole
H: Hydrocortisone
I: Rifaximin
J: Mesalamine

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best treatment for this patient. Let's see what the patient's history is. She's a 24-year-old college student who's been healthy for six months. She's experiencing abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation. These symptoms are worse when she's preparing for exams and improve after she eats. She doesn't take any medications, and she doesn't smoke or use illicit drugs. She does drink alcohol occasionally, though. Her height is 160 cm and weight is 57 kg, which gives her a BMI of 22 kg/m². Her pulse is 72 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is 100/72 mmHg. 

The physical exam shows no other abnormalities, so no signs of infections or other issues. A complete blood count and serum electrolytes are within normal ranges. The urease breath test is negative, so no hyperuricemia. Upper and lower endoscopy also show nothing abnormal.

So, what's the possible diagnosis here? The symptoms of constipation and bloating are common in various conditions. The fact that the symptoms improve after eating suggests it's not something that's triggered by food. The lack of medications and alcohol use suggests it's not a condition like IBS or CIBD.

Looking at the options:

A: Prednisolone — That's for the treatment of Crohn's disease and IBS, but the patient doesn't have any signs of IBS. It's more for chronic inflammation.

B: Omeprazole — That's for IBS in adults, especially for those without a history of Crohn's. It's a beta-lactam antibiotic.

C: Azathioprine — Also used for IBS, but it's usually for adults and can be used in children with a history of IBS.

D: Lubiprostone — That's a class D muscle relaxant, used for constipation in children. But does the patient have a history of a weakened muscle? Also, she's a college student; not sure about medical history.

E: Loperamide — This is a muscle relaxant for adults, same as Lubiprostone. Not sure about her condition.

F: Infliximab — That's a medication used to prevent ulcers, not for constipation.

G: Metronidazole — Also a muscle relaxant for adults. Used in IBS and Crohn's.

H: Hydrocortisone — This is a muscle relaxant, but it's not a medication; it's a preservative. So it's not a treatment option.

I: Rifaximin — That's for ulcerative colitis, which is more severe than IBS. She doesn't have any symptoms of IBD.

J: Mesalamine — A statin, used for high cholesterol. Not relevant here.

So considering the patient's symptoms and the options, the most likely diagnosis is IBS. Omeprazole and Lubiprostone are both beta-lactams and used for IBS. Omeprazole is more commonly prescribed for adults with IBS, especially those without a history of Crohn's. It's an antibiotic that can help with symptoms like bloating and constipation when the patient isn't on a medication.

Wait, are there any other possible conditions? Maybe irritable bowel syndrome, but that's usually with symptoms like pain and gas, not bloating. Her symptoms are more severe when preparing for exams, which might not align with IBS. But since she's not taking any medications and just has constant constipation, it's more likely IBS.

So, the best treatment would be an antibiotic for IBS. Omeprazole is a good choice. The other options don't fit her situation. So the answer should be B: Omeprazole.

The patient presents with symptoms of constipation and bloating that worsen after eating, and her condition is stable. Her lack of medications, alcohol use, and body functions (e.g., blood pressure, pulse) support an IBS diagnosis. Among the options, Omeprazole is the most appropriate treatment for adults with IBS, given its efficacy and common use in managing IBS in a non-C罗hn's disease setting. 

Answer: B: Omeprazole
