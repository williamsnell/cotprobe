Question:

A retiree owned a building in a city. Several years ago, an artist, in a signed writing, entered a three- year lease agreement with the retiree. The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?

Options:

A: Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.
B: Sue the artist for damages due to the infestation of rats.
C: Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.
D: Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.
E: Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.
F: Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years.
G: Require the artist to pay for the extermination of the rats.
H: Terminate the lease agreement without any further obligations.
I: Recovery of triple the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a lease agreement and what the remedies available to the tenant are. Let me read it again carefully.

The scenario is: A retiree owns a building. An artist signed a three-year lease for the third-floor apartment. The artist pays $800 a month. The term has expired, but the artist keeps paying. The building became infested with rats because a restaurant was opened nearby. The artist didn't like the rats and told the artist he's leaving soon, but hasn't been heard from. Now, the question is, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial three years?

The options are A to I, and the last letter of the answer must be the chosen letter. So, it's a multiple-choice question with options A to I.

I need to think about the law regarding leases and termination. So, the key points are:

1. The lease was three years old, but it's expired. So, the initial term is over, but the artist is still paying.
2. The building was infested with rats because a restaurant was built. The artist didn't like the rats and served notice that he's leaving soon.
3. The question is about the remedy for the artist before she accepted the first rental payment after the three-year term. So, the initial three years have already passed, but the artist keeps paying, leading to a rat infestation.

I remember that under common law, a tenant can recover from the landlord for breach of a lease, but only if the landlord failed to exercise due care. Wait, but I think that if the landlord doesn't exercise due care, the tenant can recover. But here, the landlord (the artist's former employer) is paying rent, so the landlord is the tenant here.

Wait, no. Wait, the landlord is the one who signed the lease. So, the landlord (the one who agreed to the lease) is the tenant. So, the landlord is the one who has breached the lease.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. In the lease, the landlord is the one who signed it, so when the landlord pays rent, that's the landlord's responsibility. The landlord is the one who is supposed to keep the lease term. So, the landlord failed to keep the lease for three years, or perhaps the lease was breached because the landlord kept paying when he was supposed to terminate.

Wait, but in this case, the artist is the one paying the rent. So, the landlord is the one who's supposed to keep the lease, but the artist is paying. So, as the landlord, if he keeps paying, that's a breach. But in this scenario, the landlord (artist's former employer) is the one paying the rent, but the lease was three years old, so the landlord is supposed to have breached the lease. Wait, no, because the initial lease term is three years, but the landlord (artist's employer) has been paying the rent. So, the landlord has breached the lease by continuing to pay.

Wait, but in common law, the landlord is the one who's supposed to keep the lease. So, if the landlord continues to pay the rent despite the lease being expired, that's a breach of the lease. But wait, the lease was three years old, but the landlord has been paying the rent for the last three years. So, the landlord has breached the lease, because he has not provided notice of the breach.

Wait, but the artist is the one who has breached the lease because he didn't terminate the lease. So, the landlord is the one who is supposed to keep the lease. So, if the landlord continues to pay, that's a breach. But in common law, the landlord can recover from the tenant for the breach.

Wait, so the landlord (artist's employer) has breached the lease by paying the rent longer than the term. The landlord is the tenant here, so he is the one who is the tenant. So, the landlord can sue the tenant for breach of contract.

But wait, in this case, the landlord (artist's employer) is paying the rent for the third year. So, the lease was three years old, but the landlord has been paying for the last three years. So, the landlord is continuing to pay beyond the term. So, the landlord has breached the lease by paying for the entire term again.

Wait, but as the landlord, if he keeps paying, that's a breach. So, the landlord is the one who is the tenant, and the tenant is the artist. So, the landlord is the one causing the breach.

So, the landlord can recover damages for the breach. But what are the options?

Looking back at the options: the question is about the remedy available to the artist before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial three years.

So, the first payment after the initial three years would be the fourth, fifth, etc. So, the artist is already on the premises beyond the three-year term. So, the landlord (artist's employer) is the one who is supposed to have kept the lease for three years, but he's continuing to pay, so the breach is ongoing.

So, the landlord can sue for breach of contract, but typically, in such cases, the landlord can recover damages. But in this case, what's the available remedy? The options include recovery of rent and possible eviction.

Wait, let's think about the options. The options are:

A: Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months beyond the three-year term.

B: Sue the artist for rat-infested rats.

C: Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value for a year.

D: Eviction because the artist didn't pay.

E: Order to move the artist out or hold responsible for three years.

F: Court order to force the artist back.

G:ç½š for extermination.

H: Terminate the lease.

I: Recovery of triple rent prorated.

So, the question is about the option available to the artist before she accepted the first payment after the three-year term. So, the first payment after the three years would be payment four. So, as the landlord, if he keeps paying, that's a breach. So, the landlord can sue for breach of contract.

Now, under common law, what can a landlord do? He can sue for damages, but if the landlord is evicted, he can impose an eviction order.

But in this case, the artist has been paying the rent for the last three years, and the building is infested because of the restaurant. The artist didn't like the rats and has served notice but hasn't been heard from. So, the landlord (artist's employer) is paying the rent for the last three years, and the landlord is the tenant.

Wait, but the landlord is the one paying the rent, so if he continues paying, he's continuing the lease beyond the term. So, the landlord is the one who breached.

So, the landlord could sue for breach of contract. But what are the remedies available?

Option A says recovery of double the rent prorated per month for the months beyond the three-year term. So, he's getting double the rent for the time he was on the premises.

Wait, but in this case, the initial lease had expired. The landlord (artist's employer) is paying the rent for the last three years, so he has breached by continuing to pay beyond the term.

But when the landlord is the tenant, what can he do? He can sue for breach of contract and recover damages. Or, if the landlord evicts the tenant, he can impose eviction.

But in this scenario, the building is infested because of a restaurant. So, maybe the landlord can impose eviction.

Wait, let's think about the options again. Option F says to seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease or hold her responsible for three years. But that seems to be about eviction.

Alternatively, if the landlord is the one paying the rent beyond the term, he can recover for the breach. But what's the standard?

In common law, a landlord can sue for breach of contract, and the landlord can recover damages. But if the landlord is evicted, he can impose an eviction order.

But in this case, the building is infested with rats, which the artist didn't like. So, perhaps the landlord can impose eviction because he's causing the problem.

Wait, but the problem is that the landlord is paying for the rent but has been continuing to pay, so he's breaching the lease. So, the landlord can sue for breach of contract. But the question is, what is the remedy available?

Another angle: the landlord can recover for the breach. The common law says that a tenant can recover from the landlord for breach of contract, but only if the landlord failed to exercise care. In this case, the landlord is paying the rent beyond the term, so the lease is now in breach. So, the landlord can sue for breach of the lease.

Alternatively, if the landlord evicts the tenant, he can impose an eviction order.

But the options don't directly say that. Let me look again.

Option F: "Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years." That sounds like eviction for three years. But option A says "recovery of double rent prorated on a monthly basis for the months beyond three years." That's about getting double the rent for the months beyond.

Hmm.

Wait, in the case of a landlord continuing to pay beyond the lease term, the landlord can sue for breach. But in some cases, the landlord can recover damages, but if the landlord is evicted, he can impose an eviction order. But I think in this case, the landlord is the one who is paying the rent, so he's the one who is the tenant.

Wait, no, the landlord is the one who signed the lease. So, the landlord is the one who is supposed to keep the lease for three years. Because the lease was three years old. So, the landlord has failed to keep the lease for three years. He has continued to pay, so that's a breach.

But in that case, the landlord can sue for breach of contract. But as the landlord, if he fails to keep the lease, he can be sued for breach.

But wait, the landlord is the one who is paying the rent for the last three years. So, the landlord is continuing to pay beyond the term. So, he's breaching the lease.

So, the landlord can sue for breach of the lease. What does that mean for the artist? Well, the landlord (the tenant) can sue for breach of contract and recover damages. Or, if the landlord evicts the tenant, he can impose an eviction order.

But the question is about the artist's remedy before she accepted the first payment after the initial three years. So, the first payment after the three years is payment four. The landlord is the one paying the rent, so he's the one on the lease.

So, the landlord is the tenant, the artist. He is paying rent for the last three years, so he's continuing to breach the lease.

So, the landlord can sue for breach of contract. But the question is about what the artist can do. Or, perhaps the landlord is the one who is the tenant, so the landlord can request the artist to continue the lease.

Wait, but the issue is whether the landlord can recover damages. Alternatively, if the landlord evicts the tenant, he can impose an eviction order.

But option F is about a court order to force the artist to continue the lease. Wait, but the landlord has already been paying and is continuing to pay beyond the term. So, perhaps he can impose an eviction.

But in the options, option F says "seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years." That sounds like eviction for another three years. So, that would be an eviction order for the next three years.

Alternatively, the landlord can recover for the breach, but in terms of remedies, the landlord can be sued for breach, which would allow him to recover damages, but if he's evicted, he can impose an eviction order.

Alternatively, maybe the landlord can recover for the breach and get damages, but also the landlord can get an eviction order if the landlord is in breach.

Wait, but the options don't have an option E, which is "Order to move the artist out or be held responsible for three years." So, perhaps that's what the option E is saying.

Wait, looking back:

E: Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.

Hmm, that sounds like the landlord is being sued for breach, and the option E is an order to evict the artist.

Wait, but in this scenario, the landlord is the one who's paying the rent beyond the three-year term. So, the landlord is the tenant, and he's the one who is the one paying for the entire term again.

So, he can sue for breach of contract, which would allow him to recover damages. Alternatively, if he evicts, he can impose an eviction order.

But the options don't have an option for that. The options are A to I, with F being a court order to force the artist to continue the lease.

Wait, the first payment after the three-year term is payment four. So, if the landlord's continuing to pay, he's breaching the lease, which may lead to eviction.

But the artist is the tenant. So, the landlord (as the tenant) can sue for breach and recover damages. But if the landlord is evicted, he can impose an eviction order.

But looking at the options, option F is about a court order to force the artist to continue the lease for another three years. That would be eviction for another three years.

So, if the landlord is the one who is the tenant, and he's the one who's continuing to pay, then the landlord can impose an eviction order, which would require the artist to leave.

But the options don't have an option for that; option E says "Order to move out or be held responsible for three years' rent." Wait, option E would require the landlord to move the artist, but the landlord is the one who's in breach of the lease.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is F, which says to seek a court order to force the artist to continue the lease for another three years. That sounds like eviction for three more years.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the lease was three years old; the rent was $800/month. The artist was on the premises for three years, but now she's paying for four, five, etc. So, the landlord is the one who is supposed to keep the lease for three years. So, continuing to pay beyond the term is a breach.

In common law, a landlord can sue for breach of the lease, and the landlord can recover damages. However, if the landlord is evicted, he can impose an eviction order. But the question is about the remedy for the artist, not the landlord's actions.

Wait, the question is about the artist's remedy before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial three years. So, the first payment is payment four. The landlord is the one paying the rent for the last three years, so he's the one on the lease.

So, the landlord can sue for breach of the lease. But the question is about the artist's remedy. The landlord is the one who is the tenant, and the artist is the tenant. So, the landlord can be sued for breach, which would allow him to recover damages.

But the options don't have the option for that. The options are:

A: Double the rent prorated on a monthly basis.

B: Sue the artist for rat damage.

C: Difference in lease price and fair market value.

D: Eviction.

E: Order artist to continue lease.

F: Court order to force artist to continue.

G:ç½š for extermination.

H: Terminate.

I: recovery of triple rent.

So, in this scenario, the landlord is the one who's the tenant, paying the rent beyond the three-year term. So, the landlord can be sued for breach, and the landlord can impose an eviction order. But which option is correct?

Option E says "Order to move the artist out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent." Wait, that seems a bit confusing. "Responsible for three years' rent" â€“ that would mean the landlord is liable for three years' rent, which is not correct because the landlord is the one who's already breached.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is F, which says to impose a court order to force the artist to continue the lease for another three years.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again about what the landlord can do. He's the one who's on the lease, paying the rent beyond the term. So, he can be sued for breach, which would allow him to recover damages.

But, wait, the question is about the artist's remedy before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial three-year term. So, the first payment is payment four. The landlord is the one who has been paying for that. So, the landlord is the one who's on the lease beyond the term, so he's the one who's breached.

Wait, but the question is about the artist's remedy. So, the landlord can't be the artist's remedy. So, the landlord's breach allows the landlord to take action against the artist.

Hmm, maybe I should think about what the landlord can do. The landlord (artist's employer) can impose an eviction order, requiring the artist to leave.

But looking at the options, option F is a court order to force the artist to continue the lease. So, that would be eviction for another three years.

Alternatively, the landlord could be sued for breach of the lease, and the landlord could be found liable for the breach, but the question is about the artist's remedy.

Wait, the landlord is the one who's paying the rent beyond the term. So, the landlord is the one who's on the lease beyond the term. So, the landlord can be sued for breach of contract, and the landlord can recover damages. But the landlord can also be ordered to continue the lease for another three years, which would be eviction for another three years.

Alternatively, the landlord can be held responsible for the term. But in this scenario, the landlord has already breached by continuing to pay.

But the options don't include an option stating that. Let me look again.

The options are A to I, and F is "Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years."

Wait, that would say that the court is ordering the artist to continue the lease for three more years. So, the landlord is the one on the lease, so the tenant is the artist. So, the landlord can be ordered to continue, meaning the landlord is the one paying for the next three years. But the landlord is the one who's already breached.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is F. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is E, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: the landlord (artist's employer) is the one who signed the lease. The lease was three years old, but the landlord continued to pay for the last three years. So, the landlord is the one who is on the lease beyond the term. So, the landlord can be sued for breach of contract, and the landlord can impose an eviction order.

But in the options, none of them say that. The options are A to I, and F is a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years.

Hmm, perhaps that's the correct answer because the landlord is the one who's on the lease, and the artist is the tenant. So, the landlord can be sued for breach of contract and can impose an eviction order.

But in the given options, F is a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years. So, that would imply that the landlord is being sued for breach, and the landlord can be compelled to continue, which would mean eviction.

Wait, but in this scenario, the landlord is the one who is on the lease, so he can be sued for breach, and he can impose an eviction order. So, the court order in F would compel the artist to continue the lease, which would mean eviction.

But the question is about the artist's remedy. So, the landlord can be sued for breach, allowing the landlord to recover damages, but if the landlord is evicted, the court order would force the artist to leave.

But in the options, F says "Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years." So, that would require the artist to continue the lease, which would be eviction.

Alternatively, perhaps the landlord can be sued for breach of the lease, and the landlord can be ordered to pay the rent again, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct option is F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the options. Let me think about the correct answer. The scenario is that the landlord (artist's employer) is the one who is on the lease, and the landlord has been paying the rent for the last three years. So, he's continuing to breach the lease beyond the term.

In this case, the landlord can be sued for breach of contract, and the landlord can impose an eviction order. So, the court order to compel the artist to continue the lease (option F) would require the artist to continue the lease, which would be eviction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because the landlord is the one who's on the lease beyond the term, so he can be compelled to continue, which would mean eviction.

But the options don't have an option about eviction. The options include F as a court order to force the artist to continue the lease for another three years, which would lead to eviction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, which says "Order to move the artist out or be held responsible for three years' rent." Wait, but the landlord is already paying, so being held responsible for three years' rent doesn't make sense.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall that in such cases, the landlord can be sued for breach of contract, and the landlord can impose an eviction order.

So, the correct answer would be F, but the option says "Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years." That would force the artist to continue, leading to eviction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the exam question is from Law textbooks. Let me try to recall the principles.

In a case where the landlord is on the lease beyond the term, he can be sued for breach of contract, and the landlord can impose an eviction order. So, the option that says "Order to force the artist to continue the lease for another three years" (option F) is the correct one.

So, the answer is F.

Wait, but let me think: the landlord is on the lease beyond the term. So, the landlord can be sued for breach of contract, and the landlord can impose an eviction order.

So, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The scenario involves a tenant (artist) who has breached a lease agreement by continuing to pay rent for the last three years beyond the lease term. The landlord, who is the tenant, can be sued for breach of contract, and the landlord can impose an eviction order. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the months beyond the three-year period. This does not directly address the landlord's breach or the eviction order.
- **B**: Sue the artist for the rat-infested rats. This is irrelevant as the scenario does not involve rat extermination.
- **C**: Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value for a year. This is unrelated to the breach of contract.
- **D**: Eviction. While the landlord can be evicted, this option does not specify the eviction order.
- **E**: Order to move the artist out or be held responsible for three years' rent. This is misleading as it does not align with the eviction order.
- **F**: Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years. This correctly describes the eviction order, requiring the artist to continue paying, leading to eviction.

ANSWER: F
