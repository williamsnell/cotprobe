Question:

A ceramics studio contracted with an artist to produce cups and saucers designed by the artist. The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: "2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery." The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?

Options:

A: No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.
B: No, because the evidence would contradict the explicit terms of the contract.
C: Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.
D: Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.
E: No, because the contract contained a merger clause which makes extrinsic evidence inadmissible.
F: Yes, because the studio's interpretation of the contract aligns with the industry practice.
G: Yes, because the court should consider industry norms in interpreting the contract.
H: No, because the agreement was completely integrated.
I: No, because the artist was unaware of the industry practice.
J: Yes, because the evidence of established industry practice may explain the ambiguity in the contract.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure out whether the studio's evidence is admissible against the artist. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the question again carefully. The studio contracted an artist to produce cups and saucers. The terms were that 2,000 sets at $5 each, and it's payable on delivery. The contract also has a merger clause. The studio produced the items and delivered them, giving the artist a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 each). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5), so they paid exactly $10,000, which is half of the agreed amount.

The studio introduced evidence that the price is set per piece rather than per-set. The question is whether this evidence is admissible against the artist.

So, the key here is understanding the elements of a breach of contract, especially the part about evidence. Let's think about the elements of a contract. A contract must have clear terms, which it does in this case—it's clearly stated as 2,000 sets at $5 each, so the studio and artist have a clear agreement.

Now, the contract has a merger clause. I remember that merger clauses are clauses that prevent the formation of a new business by combining two or more parties. They typically prevent the creation of a new entity but allow for the possibility of a merger if the parties agree. So, the studio and artist have a clause that says you can’t merge, but if they do, that's allowed. 

But wait, the question is about evidence admissibility. So, when a party provides evidence that the contract was formed, the court must consider whether that evidence is extrinsic. Extrinsic evidence is not part of the contract terms and is considered evidence of the contract. However, there are exceptions.

I remember that if the contract contains a merger clause, then any extrinsic evidence (like the way the price was structured, like per-piece) could be inadmissible. Because the merger clause allows the possibility of combining but doesn't prevent the formation of a new business. So, the contract as stated doesn't create a new entity, but if the contract says something that could create a new one, then extrinsic evidence might not be admissible.

So, in this case, the contract doesn't have a merger clause. Wait, let me double-check. The question says the contract "contained a merger clause." No, wait, the question doesn’t say that. Wait, no, the initial paragraph says, "The contract contained a merger clause." But no, wait, looking back, the question says: "The contract contained a merger clause." Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me read the question again.

Wait, I should check exactly what the question says. The question says, "The contract contained a merger clause." But looking back, the initial lines: "The contract contained a merger clause." Oh wait, no, the exact question says: "The contract contained a merger clause." But I thought I read that in the question. Let me look back.

No, actually, the question says: "The contract contained a merger clause." But looking at the initial prompt, I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, the question actually says "The contract contained a merger clause." But wait, looking again:

The initial question says: "The contract contained a merger clause." But wait, I just checked, the actual question is: 

"The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 each). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis."

So the contract does contain a merger clause. Now, the next point is whether extrinsic evidence (like per-piece pricing) is admissible. I remember that in some jurisdictions, if a contract contains a merger clause, any extrinsic evidence of the terms must be deemed extrinsic because the contract doesn't allow the formation of a new business. So, the evidence provided by the studio is extrinsic and thus inadmissible.

Wait, but let me think again. The merger clause is a clause that prevents the parties from merging to form a new business. So, the contract doesn't create a new entity, but the clause doesn't forbid that. So, the contract could potentially be merged, but that's a separate issue.

But the key is whether the evidence is extrinsic. The fact that the contract has a merger clause means that any evidence that isn't part of the contract's terms and is extrinsic is inadmissible. Because, if the contract says something that could create a new business, then the contract isn't legally binding on the formation of a new entity. Therefore, any evidence of the terms must be subject to the law of contracts, and if the contract contains a merger clause, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible.

So, the evidence the studio provided—price per piece—would be extrinsic evidence because it's not part of the contract's terms. Therefore, it's inadmissible. So the studio's evidence is not admissible, so the answer would be "No," which is option E.

But wait, the options say:

E: No, because the contract contained a merger clause which makes extrinsic evidence inadmissible.

Yes, that's what I concluded. So the correct answer should be E.

The question involves determining whether extrinsic evidence in a contract containing a merger clause is admissible. A merger clause prevents the formation of a new business but does not allow extrinsic evidence of terms. The contract in question includes a merger clause, which makes extrinsic evidence inadmissible. The studio provided evidence of a per-piece pricing structure, which is extrinsic. Therefore, this evidence is not admissible, making the answer E.

Answer: E
