Okay, so I have this question about Ethan, a new preschool student who doesn't talk or play with others during center time. The question is asking which strategy will best help him develop interpersonal relationships. The options are A to J, and I need to choose the best one.

First, I need to understand what developing interpersonal relationships means. Interpersonal skills include things like communication, empathy, cooperation, and respect. So, the strategies should foster these qualities.

Looking at the options:

A: Asking Ethan to lead a group activity without guidance. That sounds like teaching him leadership. He wouldn't necessarily improve his social skills unless he's already using them, but it might set the stage for cooperation.

B: Ignoring Ethan and hoping it improves. That's not a good approach because ignoring can lead to more problems. It's better to address the issue directly.

C: Assigning Ethan to a different classroom. That's probably not helpful because it might not address his needs in the current environment. It could lead to more problems elsewhere.

D: Assigning a partner. If Ethan is the one doing the center, finding a partner could help him connect with others. But it's more about social bonds than interpersonal relationships on a larger scale.

E: Reprimanding Ethan. That's harsh and could make him worse off. It's not a good strategy for building relationships.

F: Reprimanding for lack of social interaction. Again, reprimanding is negative. It's not effective for developing positive social skills.

G: Demonstrating empathy. Showing how to show empathy might help Ethan understand others' feelings, which could improve his ability to communicate and interact with others.

H: Modeling appropriate affection. If Ethan sees a teacher showing affection, he might pick up on that and learn to do it themselves, which is a good way to teach empathy and respect.

I: Modeling how to show appropriate affection. Similar to G, but this is about the teacher demonstrating the behavior.

J: Encouraging students to name and discuss feelings. This could help Ethan learn to express his feelings, which is part of social skills.

Now, the question is about developing interpersonal relationships. So the best strategies are those that help him connect with others, perhaps in group settings, and build social bonds.

Option D assigns a partner, which could help him form a social circle, but it's more about a small group and doesn't necessarily lead to broader interpersonal relationships.

Option H is about modeling appropriate affection, which is a behavior that teaches respect and empathy. That's a good approach.

Option I is about modeling affection, which is the same as G but phrased differently. It's about the teacher's behavior.

Option J is encouraging students to name feelings, which can help in expressing emotions and understanding others, but it's a specific behavior.

Option B ignores the problem, which isn't helpful.

Option A could help by setting the stage for cooperation, but it doesn't directly foster relationships.

Option C is moving him elsewhere, which isn't ideal.

So, the best options are H and I, which are both about modeling good behaviors. But the question is about developing interpersonal relationships, which is a broader goal. H and I are both about teaching specific behaviors that contribute to that.

Looking at the options, the best is either H or I. Since I is about modeling affection, which is a form of interaction, while H is about demonstrating how to show others' affection, which is also a helpful behavior.

Wait, but the question is about developing interpersonal relationships, which includes more than just showing affection. Modeling appropriate behavior is a way to teach respect and empathy, which are part of interpersonal relationships.

So between H and I, I think the answer is H because it's about modeling, which is a foundational behavior for developing interpersonal skills.

To develop interpersonal relationships, the best strategies focus on fostering communication, empathy, and cooperation. Among the options, **H: Encouraging Ethan to join in group activities without providing support** is ideal. This helps him learn how to show appropriate affection. While **I: Modeling how to show appropriate affection** is also effective, it's about the teacher's behavior. H is about teaching a behavior that contributes to interpersonal skills. 

Answer: H
