Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the flow rate in an artery using Poiseuille's Law. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that Poiseuille's Law relates the flow rate to the pressure gradient, the radius, and the length of the tube. The formula is Q equals (π * ΔP * R^4) divided by (8 * η * L). Oh wait, no, wait. Or is it Q equals (π * ΔP * R^4) / (8 η L)? I think that's right.

So the given values are η as 0.027, R is 0.008 cm, I think. Wait, wait, the problem says R is 0.008 cm. Oh, and I is the length, which is 2 cm, and P is 4000 dynes/cm². Wait, but wait, the pressure difference is ΔP equals P, since P is given as the pressure at one end. So ΔP is 4000.

So plugging in the numbers: let's write it out.

Q = (π * ΔP * R^4) / (8 η L)

Let me plug in the values step by step.

ΔP is 4000 dynes/cm².

R is 0.008 cm. So R^4 is (0.008)^4. Let's compute that. 0.008 is 8e-3. So (8e-3)^4 = 8^4 * (1e-3)^4 = 4096 * 1e-12 = 4.096e-9 cm^4.

Wait, wait, 8^4 is 8*8=64; 64*8=512; 512*8=4096. So yes, 4096 times 1e-12 is 4.096e-9.

The numerator then is π * 4000 * 4.096e-9. Let's compute that.

First, π is approximately 3.1416. So:

3.1416 * 4000 = 12566.4. Then multiply by 4.096e-9. So 12566.4 * 4.096e-9.

Hmm, 12566.4 * 4 is 50,265.6, but since it's 4.096e-9, it's 12566.4 * 4.096 = let's compute that:

4.096 is approx 4.1, so 12566.4 * 4.1. Let's do 12566.4 *4=50265.6, 12566.4 *0.1=1256.64. So sum is 50265.6 +1256.64=51522.24. So 51522.24e-9 = 5.152224e-5. So the numerator is approximately 5.152e-5.

Denominator: 8 * η * L. η is 0.027, L is 2 cm. So 8 * 0.027 * 2.

8 * 0.027 is 0.216. Multiply by 2: 0.432.

So denominator is 0.432 cm.

Therefore, Q is (5.152e-5) / (0.432) = let's compute that.

5.152e-5 divided by 0.432. Let's compute 5.152e-5 / 0.432.

First, 5.152e-5 is 5.152/1e5 = 5.152e-5. Dividing by 0.432 is the same as multiplying by 1/0.432.

1/0.432 is approximately 2.3148.

5.152e-5 * 2.3148 = ?

5e-5 is 0.00005.

5.152e-5 * 2.3148 ≈ 5.152 * 2.3148e-5.

Compute 5 * 2.3148 = 11.574, 0.152 * 2.3148 ≈ 0.352.

So total is approximately 11.574 + 0.352 = 11.926. So 11.926e-5, which is 1.1926e-4 cm³/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1.19e-4 and option H is 2.35e-4. So my calculation gives approximately 1.19e-4. But let me check if I did everything right.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, are the units correct? The problem states the pressure is in dynes/cm². Since 1 dyne is 10^-5 N, and pressure is force per area. So, the units for Poiseuille's law should be correct.

Let me go through the calculation again.

Q = (pi * ΔP * R^4) / (8 * eta * L)

ΔP is 4000 dynes/cm².

R is 0.008 cm, so R^4 is (0.008)^4.

0.008 is 8e-3. So (8e-3)^4 is 8^4=4096, times 1e-12 (since (1e-3)^4 is 1e-12). So 4096e-12 cm^4.

So R^4 = 4.096e-9 cm^4.

So numerator: pi * 4000 * 4.096e-9.

Pi is about 3.1416, so 3.1416 *4000= 12566.4. Multiply by 4.096e-9: 12566.4 *4.096e-9 =5.152e-5.

Denominator: 8 * 0.027 * 2.

8 *0.027 = 0.216. 0.216 *2 = 0.432.

So Q = 5.152e-5 / 0.432 ≈ 1.192e-4 cm³/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.19e-4, which is correct. So the answer should be D.

To calculate the flow rate \( Q \) in the artery using Poiseuille's Law, the formula is:

\[
Q = \frac{\pi \Delta P R^4}{8 \eta L}
\]

### Given Data:
- \( \eta = 0.027 \, \text{dynes/cm}^2 \)
- \( R = 0.008 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( L = 2 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( \Delta P = 4000 \, \text{dynes/cm}^2 \)

### Calculation:
1. **Numerator**:  
   Compute \( R^4 \):  
   \[
   R^4 = (0.008)^4 = (8 \times 10^{-3})^4 = 8^4 \times (10^{-3})^4 = 4096 \times 10^{-12} = 4.096 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{cm}^4
   \]  
   Multiply by \( \pi \), \( \Delta P \), and \( R^4 \):  
   \[
   \pi \Delta P R^4 = 3.1416 \times 4000 \times 4.096 \times 10^{-9}
   \]  
   First, \( 3.1416 \times 4000 = 12566.4 \).  
   Then, \( 12566.4 \times 4.096 \times 10^{-9} = 5.152 \times 10^{-5} \).

2. **Denominator**:  
   Compute \( 8 \eta L \):  
   \[
   8 \eta L = 8 \times 0.027 \times 2 = 0.432 \, \text{dynes/cm}^2 \, \text{cm}
   \]

3. **Flow Rate**:  
   \[
   Q = \frac{5.152 \times 10^{-5}}{0.432} = 1.192 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
The calculated flow rate \( Q = 1.192 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s} \) matches option **D: \( 1.19 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s} \)**.
