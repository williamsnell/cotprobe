Okay, I'm trying to figure out this economics question about free trade and the U.S. producing rice. Let me think through this. 

So, the question says that the U.S. produces rice in a competitive market, and with free trade, the world price is lower than the domestic price. I remember that in free trade, countries can affect prices by importing or exporting goods. 

When the world price is lower than the domestic price, that means the domestic price is higher. So, the U.S. is more expensive for domestic consumers. But since the world price is lower, maybe the U.S. starts importing more rice from other countries. 

Wait, why would they import? Oh right, because when the world price is lower, domestic production is higher than what the world can supply. So the U.S. must import to meet the lower price. For example, if the U.S. can't sell all the rice they produce at the domestic price, they import what's cheaper there. 

Looking at the options, option A says they import to make up for a domestic shortage. But if the domestic price is higher, a shortage would mean they need more. So importing would fill that gap. Option B says they export, but that doesn't make sense because exporting would make the price higher, which is the opposite of what happens here. 

Option C talks about eliminating a domestic surplus. Wait, a surplus is when production exceeds demand. If the world price is lower, domestic demand might be lower than production. So if the domestic demand is higher, the surplus would be because the U.S. is producing more than what the world can supply at the same price. So they must import to cover that surplus. Thus, option C is about import to eliminate surplus, which makes sense.

Option D is about exporting to eliminate a surplus. If they export, the price would rise, which is the opposite of what's happening. So D isn't right.

So the correct answer is C: The United States begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.

The correct answer is C: The United States begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.

**Explanation:**
When the world price is lower than the domestic price, the U.S. must import rice to meet the reduced demand. This is because the domestic supply is higher than the world production at the higher price, leading to a domestic surplus. Importing fills this gap, thus eliminating the surplus. 

**Answer:** C
