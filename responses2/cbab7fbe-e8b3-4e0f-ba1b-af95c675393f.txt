Question:

Suppose a commercial bank has deposits of $400,000 and has made loans and investments of $315,000. Assume also that deposits are its only source of reserves. If the required reserve ratio is 20%, how much are its excess reserves?

Options:

A: $85,000
B: $80,000
C: $5,000
D: $315,000

Okay, so I have this question about a commercial bank's excess reserves. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my economics class. So, the question says the bank has $400,000 in deposits and $315,000 in loans and investments. Oh wait, but deposits are only its source of reserves. That's important.

The required reserve ratio is 20%, which is 0.2 in decimal. I remember that the required reserves are calculated as the required reserve ratio multiplied by the deposits. So, that's 0.2 times $400,000. Let me calculate that: 0.2 * 400,000 = $80,000. So, required reserves are $80,000.

Now, the bank's actual reserves are the deposits minus the loans and investments. Because the only source of reserves is deposits, that's $400,000 minus $315,000. Let me subtract: 400k - 315k is $85,000. So, the actual reserves are $85,000.

Excess reserves would be actual reserves minus required reserves. So, $85k minus $80k is $5,000. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is $5,000. So, that's the answer.

The required reserve ratio is 20%, so the required reserves are calculated as:

\[ \text{Required Reserves} = 0.2 \times \$400,000 = \$80,000 \]

The actual reserves are the deposits minus the loans and investments:

\[ \text{Actual Reserves} = \$400,000 - \$315,000 = \$85,000 \]

Excess reserves are the difference between actual and required reserves:

\[ \text{Excess Reserves} = \$85,000 - \$80,000 = \$5,000 \]
