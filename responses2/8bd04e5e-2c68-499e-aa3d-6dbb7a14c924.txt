Okay, I've got this question about remote procedure calls, or RPCs. Hmm, what do I remember about them? So, the question is asking which statement about RPCs is true. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, let me think. RPCs are used in Windows to call functions from other languages, right? Like, if a C function is called from a .NET app or something. So, what are the characteristics of RPCs?

Option A says it's used for addresses farther than 2^16 bytes. Wait, I know that 2^16 bytes is 65536 bytes, which is 6 KB. So, calling procedures beyond that distance isn't possible with a direct call. But RPCs do allow calls beyond that, but maybe there's a limit on the size of the data transfer. I think RPCs can handle larger addresses because they use a different protocol, but the question says "farther than 2^16 bytes". I'm not sure, but I'm thinking that RPCs don't have a maximum distance limitation, unlike some other methods.

Option B: It cannot return a value. Wait, that doesn't make sense. I remember that RPCs can return values. For example, calling a function that returns a value, like a read operation, would return it. So B could be incorrect.

Option C: It cannot pass parameters by reference. Wait, no, I don't think RPCs have any limitations on passing parameters by reference. Most programming languages have support for passing by reference, so C would be incorrect.

Option D: It cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. No, I thought RPCs are designed to let you call functions from other languages, like C, Java, etc. So D would be incorrect.

So putting it all together: Let's evaluate each option.

A: Farther than 2^16 bytes: I'm not sure if RPCs can handle that. Wait, I think RPCs can handle larger addresses. Because in some systems, even beyond 2^16, you can call other languages' functions. So maybe A is false. Or maybe it's that RPCs don't have a maximum address limit, so A's statement is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which statement is true.

So looking again:

Option C: It cannot pass parameters by reference. No, because in RPCs, you can pass parameters by reference, so C is false.

Option B: It cannot return a value. No, because RPCs do return values.

Option D: It cannot call procedures implemented in a different language. No, because RPCs do support that.

So, which leaves option A. But wait, I thought RPCs can handle larger addresses. So A's statement that it's used for addresses farther than 2^16 is not true. Because maybe RPCs can call functions beyond that, but the limit is not 2^16, but perhaps it's the other way around? Or perhaps the limit is that RPCs can handle larger addresses than 2^16. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently. RPCs are used when you want to call a C or C++ function from a .NET application, for example. They don't have a maximum address limit because the function could be called from any address. So, the maximum distance isn't a limitation. But wait, the question's statement A says "farther than 2^16 bytes". So if RPCs can handle calls beyond that, then A's statement is false. But I'm not certain. Another thought: maybe RPCs have a maximum size, but I don't recall that. So A's statement might be the correct one, but I'm a bit unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is correct because RPCs can call procedures beyond a certain size, but I thought they can handle larger addresses. So maybe the statement is true, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A is the correct statement.

Wait, another approach: let's think about what each option implies.

Option A: The RPC is used for addresses farther than 65536 bytes. But I thought RPCs can call functions from any address, so it's not limited. Therefore, option A's statement is incorrect.

Wait, no. Because the question says the last character of the response must be the letter chosen. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember the correct answer. I think in the options, the correct statement is A. Because in reality, RPCs can call functions even beyond 2^16 bytes. So the statement in A is saying that RPCs can't call functions farther than that, which is incorrect because RPCs can. So the statement is false. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: RPCs are used for calls where the address is too large to be handled by direct calls, but they can handle longer addresses than 2^16. So A's statement is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true. So perhaps the correct answer is A. Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up RPCs with other programming methods. For example, in C, you might have to pass a pointer as a reference, but I think RPCs don't have that limitation. So, the correct answer would be option A: not true? Or option A is correct?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me see what I know. Another approach: I remember that RPCs can call functions from other languages, but they can handle larger addresses than 2^16. So the statement A says it's used for calls beyond that, which is correct. Because, for example, you can call a C function from a .NET app that's located in a very far distance, and RPCs can handle that. But wait, the maximum address that RPCs can handle is not a limit, right? Or else, if the maximum address is 2^16, then A's statement is correct. Wait, no, I think RPCs can handle larger than that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because RPCs can call procedures at larger addresses than 2^16 bytes, so the statement is true.

Wait, no. I'm getting myself confused. Let's try to recall. RPCs can call functions from other languages, but they can do so regardless of the address size. So the maximum address is not a limitation. So, option A is incorrect because it's stating that the RPC is used for addresses further than 2^16 bytes, which is not true.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option again.

Option B: RPCs cannot return a value. No, because they can return values from functions.

Option C: RPCs can't pass parameters by reference. No, that's wrong because they can.

Option D: Can't call other languages' procedures. No, because RPCs do allow that.

So the only option left is A. Wait, but earlier I thought A was incorrect because RPCs can handle larger addresses. So if the statement is that RPCs can't call procedures beyond 2^16 bytes, then A is incorrect. So why is A a true statement?

Wait, no, the statement is: A is used for calls farther than 2^16. So if RPCs can call beyond that, then A is false. So which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe RPCs cannot call procedures beyond a certain address, but I don't think that's the case. So perhaps A is the correct statement because it's true, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A because RPCs can call functions at any address, thus the statement that they can't is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should pick option A as the correct answer because the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Each option is a statement, and the correct answer is the one that is true.

Hmm, I'm going to make a call here. Based on my understanding, the correct answer is A: It is used to call procedures with addresses farther than 2^16 bytes away. Because RPCs can handle calls beyond that, so the statement is true. So the answer is A.
</think>

The correct answer is A: It is used to call procedures with addresses farther than 2^16 bytes away.

**Explanation:**
- **Option A:** This statement is true because remote procedure calls (RPCs) can indeed handle calls to procedures located at addresses beyond 2^16 bytes away. RPCs are capable of addressing larger distances compared to direct calls.
- **Option B:** This is incorrect because RPCs can return values from functions they call.
- **Option C:** This is incorrect because RPCs can pass parameters by reference.
- **Option D:** This is incorrect because RPCs can call procedures implemented in other languages.

Thus, the true statement is A.

**Answer: A**
