Alright, so I've got this question here about Mr. Murphy wanting to have $10,000 in his account after 10 years with annual compounding interest at 4%. I need to figure out how much he should invest now. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when dealing with compound interest, the formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). In this case, since it's compounded annually, n is 1. So the formula simplifies to A = P(1 + r)^t. 

Wait, but I need to find the present value, right? Because Mr. Murphy wants to know how much he needs to invest now to have $10,000 in ten years. So I should rearrange the formula to solve for P. 

Let me write that down. The future value A is $10,000. The rate r is 4%, which is 0.04. The time t is 10 years. And since it's compounded annually, n is 1. So the formula becomes P = A / (1 + r)^t. 

Plugging in the numbers: P = 10,000 / (1 + 0.04)^10. Let me calculate that step by step. 

Calculating 1.04 raised to the 10th power. Let me think, 1.04^10... I remember that 1.04^10 is approximately 1.480244285. Let me double-check that because I might be mixing it up with something else. Oh wait, sometimes people use 1.04^10 is about 1.480244285. So yes, that's correct.

So then P = 10,000 / 1.480244285. Let me compute that. Hmm, 10,000 divided by approximately 1.480244 is roughly 6756.80. So looking at the options, option F is $6,756.00. That's very close to what I got. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate. 1.04^10 is about 1.480244, so 10k divided by 1.480244 is approximately 6756.80. So yes, F makes sense. 

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. Let me calculate 1.04^10. Let's do it step by step. 

Year 1: 1.04^1 = 1.04
Year 2: 1.04 * 1.04 = 1.0816
Year 3: 1.0816 * 1.04 = 1.124864
Year 4: 1.124864 * 1.04 ≈ 1.16985856
Year 5: 1.16985856 * 1.04 ≈ 1.2166529024
Year 6: 1.2166529024 * 1.04 ≈ 1.265319678976
Year 7: 1.265319678976 * 1.04 ≈ 1.315931876467
Year 8: 1.315931876467 * 1.04 ≈ 1.368569236793
Year 9: 1.368569236793 * 1.04 ≈ 1.423337546339
Year 10: 1.423337546339 * 1.04 ≈ 1.48024428553. 

So, yes, that's correct. So 1.04^10 is approximately 1.48024428553. 

So P = 10,000 / 1.48024428553 = approximately 6756.80. 

Looking at the options, F is $6,756.00. So the correct answer should be F.
