Question:

You are given Mendel ' s original data on the inheritance of yellow versus green cotyledons. In his experiment, 8023 individuals were scored. Of the 8023, 6022 were yellow and 2001 were green. We expect that yellow and green will appear in a 3:1 ratio respectively. Using the chi-square test (X^2), how well does Mendel's data fit our proposed ratio?

Options:

A: Mendel's data suggests a 2:1 ratio instead of the expected 3:1 ratio
B: The observed ratio is exactly 3:1
C: The data supports a 4:1 ratio rather than the expected 3:1 ratio
D: Mendel ' s data does not fit the proposed ratio
E: The ratio is not close to the proposed ratio
F: Mendel's data is inconclusive due to the large sample size
G: The chi-square test shows significant deviation from the expected ratio
H: The data is inconsistent with Mendel ' s findings
I: The chi-square test indicates a perfect fit with no variation
J: Mendel ' s data fits the proposed ratio very closely

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about Mendel's experiment and the chi-square test. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I remember that Mendel's experiment was about the inheritance of coat color in his experiment with dihybrid crosses. He crossed two parents, one with yellow and one with green, and observed the ratios of the offspring.

The question says that 8023 individuals were scored, with 6022 yellow and 2001 green. So in the population, there's a lot more yellow individuals than green. The expected ratio is 3:1, which means for every 4 offspring, 3 are yellow and 1 is green. But wait, the actual observed data is 6022/8023 for yellow. Let me compute that ratio to see how it compares.

So, 6022 divided by 8023... Well, roughly, 6022 is almost 8023 * 0.75. Let me compute 6022 / 8023. Let's approximate: 8023 * 0.75 = 6017.25. So 6022 is about 0.75 + 4.75/8023. So 4.75/8023 is approximately 0.00059. So overall, the observed yellow ratio is about 75.059%, which is close to 75%. The expected 3:1 ratio is 75%, same as observed. But wait, the actual observed numbers are 6022 and 2001. Let me calculate the observed ratio exactly.

Wait, 6022 is 8023 - 2001. So, 6022 / 8023 is 6022 / 8023. Let me compute that precisely. Let's divide 6022 by 8023.

8023 * 0.75 is 6017.25. So 6022 is 6017.25 + 4.75. So 4.75 / 8023 is approximately 0.000592. So the observed proportion is 0.75 + 0.000592 = approximately 0.750592, so 75.0592%.

The expected 3:1 ratio is exactly 75%. So the observed is about 75.06%, which is very close to 75%.

But the question is about using the chi-square test to see how well the data fits the expected ratio. Chi-square test is used to determine whether there's a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies.

The formula for chi-square (X²) is Σ( (O - E)² / E ), where O is observed and E is expected.

First, I need to calculate expected counts. The expected number of yellow is (3/4)*8023, and green is (1/4)*8023.

Calculating expected for yellow: 8023 * 3/4 = 8023 * 0.75 = 6017.25. The observed is 6022, so O - E is 6022 - 6017.25 = 4.75.

For green: expected is 2005.75, observed is 2001, so O - E is 2001 - 2005.75 = -4.75.

So now, compute (O-E)^2 / E for both.

For yellow: (4.75)^2 / 6017.25. Let's compute 4.75 squared: 22.5625. Divided by 6017.25: 22.5625 / 6017.25 ≈ 0.00375.

For green: (-4.75)^2 is 22.5625. Divided by 2005.75: 22.5625 / 2005.75 ≈ 0.01125.

So X² = 0.00375 + 0.01125 = 0.015.

Now, the degrees of freedom (df) is the number of categories minus one. Since there are two categories (yellow and green), df = 1.

Looking up the chi-square distribution table for df=1 and seeing what p-value corresponds to X²=0.015. The critical value for a 0.05 significance level is about 3.841. Our X² is 0.015, which is way below 3.841. So the p-value is way higher than 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

The null hypothesis here is that the observed and expected frequencies are the same. So the data fits the expected ratio. So the chi-square test shows no significant deviation. Looking at the options, option E says the ratio is not close to the proposed, which would be false. Option G says the data supports a 4:1 ratio, which is wrong. Option H says it's a perfect fit, which is wrong. Option I says it shows a perfect fit, which is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm getting X²=0.015. That's a small value, so p is high. So the data fits well. So the correct option would be E: the ratio is not close to the proposed ratio. Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, the observed ratio is very close to the expected ratio because the chi-square is small. So in the context of the question, the data fits the expected ratio. So the chi-square test would show no significant deviation.

Looking back at the options, option E says the data does not fit the proposed ratio. That's incorrect because it does fit. Option G says the data supports a 4:1 ratio, which is wrong. Option H is incorrect. Option I says perfect fit, which is wrong. Option J says the data fits very closely, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is about whether the data fits the expected ratio. So the correct option is J: Mendel's data fits the proposed ratio very closely. Because the chi-square is small, the observed and expected are very close. So the answer is J.

Mendel's experiment involved crossing parents with yellow and green cotyledons and observing the ratios of offspring colors. The observed data showed 6022 yellow and 2001 green individuals out of 8023, yielding a yellow proportion of approximately 75.06% and a green proportion of 74.94%. The expected 3:1 ratio corresponds to 75% yellow and 25% green.

To determine if the observed data fits the expected ratio, a chi-square test was conducted. The expected counts were calculated as follows: for yellow, \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8023 = 6017.25 \), and for green, \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8023 = 2005.75 \). The chi-square statistic was computed using the formula \( \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} \), resulting in \( X^2 = 0.015 \) for a degree of freedom (df) of 1. This value is much smaller than the critical value of 3.841 for a 0.05 significance level, indicating no significant deviation from the expected ratio.

Given that the chi-square test did not show a significant difference, Mendel's data fits the proposed 3:1 ratio very closely. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: Mendel's data fits the proposed ratio very closely.**
