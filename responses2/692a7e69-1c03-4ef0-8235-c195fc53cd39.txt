The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man and a woman conspired together to rob a bank. As they were exiting the bank after the robbery they were confronted by armed tactical police officers. The man raised his gun at the officers and a flurry of shots followed. The man was injured but survived; the woman co-conspirator died from a police officer's bullet. The authorities charged the man with felony-murder of the woman. He was convicted and appealed. Under the prevailing modern view of felony murder, will the appellate court likely reverse the first-degree murder conviction?

Options:

A: Yes, because the felony murder rule only applies when the defendant is the one who directly causes the death.
B: Yes, because the police officer who shot the woman should be the one charged with murder, not the man.
C: No, because felony murder applies regardless of who fires the fatal shot as long as a death occurred during the commission of the felony.
D: No, because the man's decision to raise his gun at the officers instigated the shooting, making him responsible for the woman's death.
E: No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.
F: Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.
G: Yes, because the woman was a co-conspirator, not a victim of the crime, and therefore her death does not qualify as a felony murder.
H: No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.
I: Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.
J: No, because the man was part of the crime and his actions led directly to the woman's death.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about felony murder. I'm a bit rusty on my criminal law, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about a case where a man and a woman conspired to rob a bank. They exited and were confronted by armed police. The man shot the officers, then the woman died. The authorities charge him with felony murder for her death. The appellate court is asking whether they'll reverse his conviction under modern felony murder rules.

First, I need to remember what felony murder is. From what I recall, felony murder is when a defendant commits a felony (like murder) and is found to have caused the death of another. The classic rule is that the defendant must have been directly responsible for the death. So, it's a cause-of-destruction rule.

But wait, there's also the issue of whether the defendant was the one who initiated the unlawful killing. I think the modern view might have changed this. I remember hearing that sometimes, even if you didn't intend to kill, if you caused the death, you can be convicted of first-degree murder, which is more severe than felony murder. But I'm not sure if it's allowed in all jurisdictions.

Looking at the options, option A says the felony murder rule only applies if the defendant is the one who caused the death. That sounds familiar. If the defendant didn't directly cause the death, they can't be convicted of felony murder. But if they did, then they might be guilty of first-degree murder.

Option B suggests the police officer is responsible. I think that's the modern approach, where the person who did the killing is charged. But I'm not certain if that's always the case. I remember some states allow for third-party responsibility for murder, but others might require the defendant to be directly at fault.

Option C says felony murder applies regardless of who shot. That doesn't sound right. I think the rule requires that the defendant was responsible for the death. So if the officer shot the woman, the officer is the one responsible, unless the defendant was part of the crime and didn't intend it, but that's a different angle.

Option D claims the man's firing the gun was the trigger. But maybe the officer was the one who committed the felony. Or perhaps the man was part of the conspiracy and didn't commit the murder himself. Wait, but the question says they conspired together to rob the bank. So perhaps the man's actions are part of the conspiracy.

Wait, the man might have been part of the felony. If the robbery was the crime, the man's actions contributed to the crime. He then shot the officers, which is a separate action. So the question is, did he cause the woman's death? The man was injured but survived, and the woman died. So he didn't kill her, but he did something that led to her death.

Hmm, so the man's actions, like raising the gun, might be considered part of the felony. If the robbery itself was the felony, the man's actions would be part of that. But is he responsible for the woman's death? Because if the robbery was the crime, and the man was part of it, then he's guilty of first-degree murder.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, if the defendant's actions were part of a larger felony, they might not be directly responsible for the death unless they intended it or acted with intent. But I'm not sure. Another angle: if the officers were armed and shot the woman, that's a separate action. So the officer's bullets are the ones that killed her. So under modern rules, the officer is the one guilty of felony murder.

Wait, but the options mention "the police officer who shot the woman." So if the police officer is the one who did the killing, then the officer is the one charged with murder. But the options are about whether the police officer is the one charged, not whether the man is.

Wait the question is about the man's guilt. If the officers shot the woman, and the police were the ones responsible, then the police are guilty, not the man. So option B suggests the woman's death is the focus, and the police officer is the one charged. So the man would be acquitted because he's not directly responsible.

But the options are about whether the man is convicted. The question is, will the appellate court reverse the first-degree murder conviction. So if the police officer is the one charged with murder, then the man isn't. But if the police officer is not involved, then the police officer is the one who killed the woman.

Wait, the question is whether the appeal is likely to reverse the conviction. So the police officer is the one who killed, so the police officer is guilty of felony murder. So the man is not guilty of the felony murder charge. So the police officer is the one to be convicted, so the man is acquitted.

So looking at the options, option B says yes, because the police officer is the one charged. So the answer would be that the police officer is guilty, so the man is not. Therefore, the answer would be B.

But another angle: some jurisdictions might not allow third-party responsibility for murder. Like, even if the police shot the woman, if the police were part of the robbery, then the police are responsible. Alternatively, if the robbery was the crime, and the police were part of it, then they're guilty, not the man.

Wait, but the robbery itself is part of the conspiracy. So the robbery was a felony. The man was part of the robbery and then took the gun, then shot the officers. So if the robbery was the crime, the man might be guilty of first-degree murder for part of the robbery. But if he shot the officers, perhaps he didn't commit the murder himself, but the officers did.

Wait, the question says the man and woman conspired together to rob the bank. So the robbery was their act. If the robbery was part of the felony, then the man was part of the crime and may be guilty of first-degree murder for his part.

But if the officers, who were part of the conspiracy, shot the woman, that's a separate event. So the officers would be responsible for the killing, but the question is about whether the man is guilty.

Wait, but the police were there to stop them, so the officers were part of the robbery. So if the robbery was the felony, then the officers are the ones who did the killing. So the officers were the ones to be charged, not the man.

Alternatively, if the officers were armed and shot the woman, they're the ones responsible. So the police officer is guilty, and the man is not. So the answer would hinge on whether the police officer is charged.

Looking back at the options, option B says the police officer is the one charged. So the answer would be that the police officer is guilty, so the man is acquitted. So the answer would be B.

But wait, what if the police officer was part of the robbery? Then the police officer is guilty, so the man isn't. So the answer is B.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure it.

The main question is whether the police officer is the one to be charged with the felony murder. If the police officer is the one who shot the woman, then option B is correct. Otherwise, if the police officer is not the one to be charged, but the man is, then other options are about the rule of causation.

But the question is under the modern view. So under modern views, does the modern rule allow the police officer to be responsible for the killing?

Wait, I think in some modern approaches, if the police were part of the crime, they can be held responsible for the killing. But if the robbery was the crime and the police were part of it, then they are guilty. But if the robbery was done by the man, then the police are not part of the crime, so they can't be responsible for the killing.

The question states that they conspired to rob a bank. So the robbery was their own act, which is a felony. So the police were part of the robbery, so they are guilty of the felony murder. So the officers are the ones responsible.

Wait, but the police were there to stop them. So in that case, perhaps the police officer is not the one to be charged, but the man is.

Wait, but the police were part of the robbery, so if the robbery was the felony, then the police officer is part of the crime, meaning they're responsible for the killing. So the police are guilty, and the man is not. Therefore, the answer is B.

So looking back, the options:

A) Yes, because the felony murder rule only applies when the defendant is the one who directly causes the death. That's correct, but the question is whether the appellate court will reverse the conviction. So if the police officer is the one charged, then the man isn't. So the answer would be B.

B) Yes, because the police officer who shot the woman should be the one charged with murder, not the man. That's correct. So the answer is B.

C) No, because felony murder applies regardless of who shot. That's incorrect because the rule requires the defendant to have been directly responsible.

D) No, the man's decision to raise his gun was the trigger. But that's more about intent, not the murder rule.

E) No, because all states have a rule. That's incorrect because some states might have different rules.

F) Yes, because the rule is unconstitutional. That's incorrect, because the rule is constitutional in many places.

G) Yes, because the woman was a co-conspirator. That's incorrect, because the co-conspirator was the man, not the woman. The woman died, so she's the victim, but that doesn't affect the defendant's guilt.

H) No, the man caused the death. But that's the issue of whether the man was responsible. If the police officer is the one charged, then the man isn't.

I) Yes, because he started the action. That's about intent, not the murder rule.

J) No, because the man was part of the crime. That's correct because he was part of the robbery.

But the question is about whether the police officer is responsible. So the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around whether a man charged with first-degree felony murder will be reversed under modern felony murder rules. The woman died from a police officer's bullet, and the police were part of the robbery that led to their death. The man, however, was injured and survived, and the police officer is charged with murder.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Modern Flaws in felony murder**: Under modern views, the rule of causation is challenged. Some jurisdictions allow third-party responsibility for murder, meaning the person who fired the bullet (officer) is the one responsible for the killing, not the defendant. This challenges the modern approach that requires the defendant to be directly responsible.

2. **Role of the Police**: If the police officer is part of the robbery, they are likely to be held responsible for the killing. Since the robbery was the felony, the officers, as part of the crime, are guilty of first-degree murder. This would mean the man is not guilty of the felony murder charge under modern rules.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The modern view challenges the rule, but the question asks whether the appellate court will reverse the conviction, not if the rule is upheld.
   - **Option B**: Correct. Under modern law, the police officer is the one to be charged with murder, making the man not guilty.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The rule requires the defendant to be directly responsible for the death, not just third parties.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The decision to raise a gun is more about intent, not the murder rule.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. Some states recognize the rule as constitutional, though others might not.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The rule is constitutional in many jurisdictions.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The woman was not a victim, but the co-conspirator was the man, not the woman.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The man was part of the robbery and therefore is guilty of first-degree murder.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The man's intent to cause harm is irrelevant to the murder charge.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The man was part of the crime, so he is guilty.

### Conclusion:
Under modern felony murder rules, the police officer is likely to be the one charged with murder, not the man. Therefore, the appellate court will reverse the conviction.
