Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about the colony of Pennsylvania and which option correctly describes it based on the provided text.

The text is from William Penn's 1701 Charter, which he granted to the inhabitants of Pennsylvania and its territories. The key points are about the conditions for being a divisor of the King. It says no person can be truly happy under the civil liberties, but if they follow the freedoms of their conscience, like religious profession and worship. Also, it mentions that no person is free from the control of Almighty God, who is the Lord of conscience. This includes the Author, as well as the object of all divine knowledge, faith, and worship. The grant is to those who have conscientious persuasion or practice.

The important part is that the colonists are not allowed to live quietly under the civil government. They must abide by the civil code, which means they can't be molested or prejudiced. They also can't be compelled to maintain religious worship or places of worship because of their conduct. So, the colonists are restricted in their activities and must comply with the King's civil code.

Now, looking at the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Independent colony governed outside the King's authority. I think that's correct because the text says the colonists are not bound by the King's authority. They're free to do what they choose as long as they follow the civil code.

Option B: Governance shared equally among all. No, that's not mentioned. The text doesn't say that governance is shared equally; it's more about what's allowed for each person.

Option C: Self-governing with no ties to a monarch. That makes sense because the text says no one has freedom under the King's rule, so they're self-governing. So the King isn't the ruler for them.

Option D: King grants a charter to a group of businessmen or colonists. The text refers to the grant to the inhabitants, not specifically businessmen. It's about the King granting the charter to a group, so maybe the colonists are the ones who got the charter.

Option E: Proprietary colony with the King's government. No, because the text says the King's civil code applies to the colonists, not the King himself. Proprietary would mean the King is the one governing, but according to the text, the King doesn't control the colonists.

Option F: King entrusted to a proprietor. That's not what the text says. The King grants the charter to a group, not to an individual. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Royal colony appointed by the King. No, the King is the one granting the charter, not appointing them.

Option H: Governed by a religious leader. The text says the King is the Lord of conscience, which is a religious figure. So the King is the one governing, not a religious leader directly controlling the colony.

Option I: Governed by a council elected by the King. The text doesn't say anything about a council being elected. It's about freedom of conscience and religious belief, not about governance structure.

Option J: Owned a single businessman. The text doesn't mention any single person; it's about the colonists as a group. So J is incorrect.

So the correct options are A, C, and J? Wait, no. Let me recheck. The question is which best describes the colony of Pennsylvania.

Option A says it's an independent colony governed outside the King's authority. That's correct because the King doesn't control them, they are self-governing.

Option C says it's self-governing with no ties to a monarch. That's also correct, as the King doesn't control them, so it's self-governing.

Wait, but looking back at the options, each is a separate choice. So the question is to choose the best description. So the options are about what the text says.

The text says, "no Person or Persons... shall be in any case molested or prejudiced, in their Person or Estate... because of their conscientious Persuasion..." So this means the King's civil code applies to the colonists, but they aren't bound by the King's authority. So the King is the ruler, but the colonists are self-regulated.

So the best description would be that the colony is self-governed, which is option C.

Wait, but the options also include A, which says it's independent, which is a bit broader. Because independent could include self-governing. But the term 'self-governing' is more specific.

Alternatively, the text says they are not bound by the King's authority. So the correct answer is option C because the King isn't the ruler for them. The colonists are self-governing, so they don't have to follow the King's rules and can't be compelled by their own conscience or religious ties.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D, etc. So the best answer would be either A or C.

Wait, the question is asking which best describes the colony. The text says the King's authority is not given to the colonists, but they are allowed to be self-governed. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says self-governing. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Independent colony governed outside the King's authority → sounds correct.

C: Self-governing colony with no ties to a monarch → also correct.

But the text says, "no Person or Persons... who shall be in any case molested or prejudiced... because of their conscientious Persuasion or Practice..." So this implies that the King has authority over the regulations, but the colonists are self-governed. So the best description is that they're self-governed, which is option C.

Option A says independent, which is a broader term. So both A and C are correct, but the options might have only one correct choice.

Wait, the options are a series, each is a separate choice. So which option correctly best describes it?

The text says that the king grants the civil code to the colons. So the colonists are self-governing, no king's control. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D, etc. So option A is independent, which is correct. So if the options are asking which best describes, then which is more accurate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The question is about the colony of Pennsylvania. The text says no one can be true happy under the King's rule. So the King doesn't control them. Therefore, the ownership is self-governed. So the best description is that it's self-governing (option C) or independent but not under the King's rule (option A).

Wait, the term "independent" might be a bit of a misnomer. The text says they are not bound by the King's authority. So the correct description is that it's self-governed, which is option C.

Alternatively, the text says that the King's civil code applies to the colonists, but they are not under his control. So the correct description is that they are self-governing, which is option C.

So the options are:

A: Independent
B: Equal
C: Self-governing with no ties
D: King grants to a group
E: Proprietary
F: King's government
G: Royal
H: By religious leader
I: Council elected by king
J: Owned by a single man

So the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The colony of Pennsylvania, as described in the text, is self-governed by the colonists themselves, without being bound by the King's authority. The King grants the colonists a charter to establish a civil code, but the colonists are free to follow the rules as dictated by their own conscience and religious beliefs. This self-governance is best captured by option C.

Answer: C
