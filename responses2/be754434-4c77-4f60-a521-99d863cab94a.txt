Okay, so I have this question about accounting regulations, specifically regarding supplementary information for local governments. Let's see, I need to figure out which option is part of the required supplementary information under general purpose external financial reporting.

Hmm, first, I remember that supplementary information is extra information that governments might need to provide beyond the main financial reports. The question is asking what's considered part of that.

Looking at the options: A is Statement of cash flows. I think the Statement of Cash Flows is part of the financial statements, but is it considered supplementary? I'm not sure. Let me think. The Statement of Cash Flows deals with cash, which is a key component of financial reporting, but it's more detailed and might be considered part of the main financial statements, not supplementary.

Option B is Internal control over financial reporting. That sounds like something that would be part of the internal controls section, not supplementary. Internal controls are part of the company's management and are typically part of the internal documentation, not external reporting.

Option C is Financial statement audit report. That's probably more about the internal review process, not supplementary information intended for public use.

Option D is Government-wide financial statement. Wait, government-wide statements are usually mandatory reports, but they might not include supplementary information unless specified. I'm not certain about this one.

Option E is Comprehensive annual financial report. I'm not familiar with this term. I think it might be a newer term or perhaps a misnomer. I'll keep this in mind for a moment.

Option F is Combining nonmajor fund statement. I remember that combining statements are part of the reporting process, especially when dealing with multiple funds. So maybe this is considered supplementary.

Option G is Fund financial statement. This sounds more like a primary statement, perhaps similar to D. It would be a standard report, not supplementary.

Option H is Management discussion and analysis. That's part of internal management reports, I believe. It's an internal document, so it's probably not supplementary.

Option I is Notes to the financial statements. Notes are typically part of the financial statements themselves, not supplementary information. They provide additional details that aren't directly part of the financial figures.

Option J isn't even here, so we're only considering up to I.

Putting this together: the question is about supplementary information. From what I remember, combining statements are part of supplementary information needed when a government reports on a combination of funds. So option F seems likely.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again. The Statement of Cash Flows is part of the main statement, not supplementary. The audit report is internal. Government-wide financial statement is maybe mandatory but not supplementary. The comprehensive annual report is probably a newer or more detailed version, but not necessarily supplementary. Combining fund statements would be supplementary because reports are combined and you need to provide an additional statement to explain the combination.

So the correct answer should be F: Combining nonmajor fund statement.

The correct answer is F: Combining nonmajor fund statement. This is because supplementary information is often needed when combining funds, such as in a government's reporting. The other options either pertain to internal controls, mandatory financial statements, or internal management documents, which are not supplementary. 

**Answer: F**
