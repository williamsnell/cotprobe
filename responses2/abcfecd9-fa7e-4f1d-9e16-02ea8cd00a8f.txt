Question:

The local high school football team won the state championship. After the game the high school held a victory rally at the high school gym. As the team was being honored, the star quarterback of the football team approached one of the cheerleaders and asked her out for a date. The cheerleader, who had a crush on the quarterback, said she'd love to go out with him. The quarterback told her, "Great, I'll pick you up at eight. "Later that evening, the quarterback was getting ready to drive to the cheerleader's home when his car wouldn't start. The quarterback then called his next-door neighbor and asked him if he could borrow his car. The neighbor agreed, but told him, "Okay, but make sure you return it by 2:00 a. m. " The quarterback assented and then drove to the cheerleader's house. After picking her up, they drove to an all-night coffee shop where they spent the night talking and catching up over coffee and waffles. Losing track of time, the quarterback and the cheerleader did not leave the coffee shop until 3:00 a. m. After returning home around 4:00 a. m. , the quarterback decided that it was too late to return the car, so he parked it in his driveway. He intended to return the car to the neighbor in the morning. A short while later, a thief stole the neighbor's car from outside the quarterback's home. The police found the car three months later, undamaged. The neighbor, however, refused to accept the car and brought a claim against the quarterback for conversion. In his claim, the neighbor will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the quarterback was not responsible for the theft.
B: not succeed, because the quarterback had no control over the actions of the thief.
C: succeed, because the quarterback had an obligation to protect the car.
D: succeed, because the quarterback left the car in his driveway, and it was stolen.
E: not succeed, because the car was returned undamaged.
F: not succeed, because the criminal act of the thief was unforeseeable.
G: succeed, because the quarterback could have returned the car and failed to do so.
H: succeed, because the quarterback failed to follow the neighbor's condition to return it by 2:00 a.m.
I: not succeed, because the quarterback intended to return the identical property he borrowed in an undamaged condition.

Okay, so I have to figure out which option the neighbor can succeed in his claim against the quarterback for conversion. Let's break down the situation step by step.

First, the events happen as follows: The quarterback and cheerleader drive to the coffee shop, park the car, and leave around 4 am. Then a thief steals the car from the neighbor's home, three months later. The police find the car, undamaged. The neighbor brings a claim against the quarterback for conversion. The question is whether the neighbor can succeed.

The options suggest that the outcome is dependent on several factors. I need to analyze these factors to determine the correct answer.

1. **Underwood's Obligations:**
   The neighbor owes the quarterback a duty to return the car. The neighbor informed the quarterback that the car would be returned by 2 am. But the quarterback park-and-go, left the car undamaged, and drove away. The thief later stole it later that night.

2. **The Thief's Actions:**
   The thief stole the car from the neighbor's home. The neighbor tried to return it by 2 am but failed. The police found it three months later, undamaged. So, the neighbor didn't have time to return the car.

3. **Conversions and Conversion Claims:**
   A conversion claim is typically about reverting the property back to its original owner. To succeed, the owner must prove that the original owner had a duty to return the property, and the thief acted in a way that breached that duty.

4. **Procedural Due:**
   The neighbor had a duty to return the car. The neighbor informed the quarterback about this duty. The quarterback park-and-go, left the car undamaged. The thief later stole it.

   The neighbor didn't return the car by 2 am, so the condition wasn't met. The condition was that the car must be returned by 2 am. Since the neighbor failed to do that, the condition wasn't breached.

   However, the neighbor's duty was to return the car. The fact that the thief stole it later doesn't directly affect the neighbor's duty to return it. The duty was about returning it under the condition set by the neighbor, not the action of the thief.

5. **State Law Considerations:**
   In many jurisdictions, the duty to return the car is a procedural duty. The neighbor must fulfill this duty. The fact that the thief stole the car later doesn't negate this obligation because the neighbor's failure to return the car on time doesn't make the thief's actions a breach of that duty.

6. **Impact of Undamaged Car:**
   The car was undamaged when the police found it. This doesn't mean it was stolen or that the neighbor failed to return it. It's just that the car wasn't damaged upon return, but the return itself wasn't a crime. However, the transfer of ownership is about the original owner's duty to return the property.

7. **Analysis of Options:**
   Let's review each option.

   A: "Not succeed because the quarterback was not responsible for the theft." This is incorrect because the neighbor's duty to return the car was a procedural duty, not a criminal one. The theft was the criminal act, but the neighbor's failure to return the car under the duty is what matters.

   B: "Not succeed because the quarterback had no control over the actions of the thief." This is incorrect. The neighbor had a duty to return the car, which the quarterback fulfilled, but the thief's actions were unrelated to the neighbor's duty.

   C: "Succeed, because the quarterback had an obligation to protect the car." This is correct. The neighbor owed the quarterback to return the car, and the failure to do so is a breach of that obligation.

   D: "Succeed, because the quarterback left the car in his driveway, and it was stolen." No, because the theft was the act that occurred later, and the neighbor's duty was about returning the car, not the transfer of ownership.

   E: "Not succeed because the car was returned undamaged." The car wasn't stolen, so the transfer wasn't affected. However, the transfer was about ownership, not the return.

   F: "Not succeed because the criminal act of the thief was unforeseeable." The thief's actions were unforeseeable because they were able to steal the car later. But the neighbor's duty was not directly related to the thief's actions.

   G: "Succeed, because the quarterback could have returned the car and failed to do so." No, because the neighbor failed to return it, not because the quarterback couldn't have returned it. The neighbor's failure was the breach of duty.

   H: "Succeed, because the quarterback failed to follow the neighbor's condition to return it by 2:00 a.m." This is incorrect because the neighbor had a duty to return the car under the condition set by the neighbor, not the quarterback. The condition was about returning by 2 am, but the transfer was of the car, not the return.

   I: "Not succeed because the quarterback intended to return the identical property he borrowed in an undamaged condition." No, because the neighbor's duty was to return the car, not to return the property the quarterback borrowed. The transfer is of ownership, not the return of the borrowed car.

   J: Not applicable since we only have options A to I.

So, the correct answer must be C: "Succeed, because the quarterback had an obligation to protect the car." Because the neighbor had a duty to return the car, which the quarterback fulfilled, and the neighbor failed to do so.

The correct answer is C: "Succeed, because the quarterback had an obligation to protect the car." The neighbor owed the quarterback a duty to return the car, which the quarterback fulfilled, and the neighbor failed to do so. This breach of duty resulted in the conversion claim succeeding. 

Answer: C
