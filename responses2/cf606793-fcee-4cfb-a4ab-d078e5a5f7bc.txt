Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question is about a ball being tossed upward against the absence of air resistance. The ball reaches a height of 20 meters. At the 10-meter position, which is halfway up the net, what's the force acting on it?

Wait, wait. The options are given, so I can refer back to them when I get to the answer. But let's try to visualize the situation.

First, when a ball is thrown straight up, it slows down as it goes up, stops at the peak, and then starts falling back down. The problem says it reaches 20 meters, so that's the maximum height. The halfway point is at 10 meters. But wait, is the net at 10 meters? If the net is at the same height as the peak, which is 20 meters, then the halfway point might be halfway between the starting point (maybe ground level?) and the peak.

Wait, the question says "the 10-m position half way up the net." Hmm. So, perhaps the net is 20 meters tall, so halfway would be 10 meters. So the ball is at 10 meters above the ground. But wait, that's the same as the peak? No, because if the ball is tossed to 20 meters, the peak is at 20 meters. So when it's 10 meters, that's the halfway point in the total height.

Wait, but in reality, the ball is in projectile motion. The velocity at 10 meters would be less than the initial velocity. But the question is about the net force on the ball at that position.

Wait, but in projectile motion, the only force acting on the ball is gravity, right? Because air resistance is absent. So F = ma, and since a is g downward, F_net is mg downward. So the net force is mg. But wait, the options have mg terms. So looking at the options, I see option I is mg, option J is mg/2, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer is one of the letters A to J, which correspond to force values.

So, the net force on the ball is mg downward. So the magnitude is mg. So the force is mg. So looking at the options, that would be option I, which is mg.

But wait, let me think again. Because when the ball is at 10 meters, which is when it's on its way down, its velocity is downwards. But the net force is always mg downward. Because acceleration is g downward. So regardless of where the ball is (on the way up or down), the net force is mg downward.

But wait, suppose I'm confused about the net force. The net force is the vector sum of all forces. But in this case, the only force is gravity, which is mg downward. So the net force is mg downward.

Wait, but let me think about energy. At the peak (20 m), the velocity is zero. So the kinetic energy is zero. At 10 m, the velocity is some positive value. But the net force is always mg, since no air resistance. So the answer would be mg, which is option I.

Wait, but let me check if I'm missing anything. The problem says "at the 10-m position half way up the net." So the net is at the same height as the peak, 20 m. So halfway is 10 m. So yes, that's correct. So the net force is mg. So option I. But wait, what's the exact wording?

The question is about the force on the ball at the 10-m position. So at 10 meters, the net force is mg. So the answer is I.

The problem involves a ball being tossed upward without air resistance, reaching a maximum height of 20 meters. At the halfway point (10 meters), the net force on the ball is determined. 

When no air resistance is present, the only force acting on the ball is gravity, which always equals \( mg \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. This force acts downward. The position of the ball (whether it is ascending or descending) does not affect the net force, as gravity remains constant. Therefore, at 10 meters, the net force on the ball is \( mg \).

Among the given options, the correct answer corresponds to \( mg \), which is option I.

Answer: I
