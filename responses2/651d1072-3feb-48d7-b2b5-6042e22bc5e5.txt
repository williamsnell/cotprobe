Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Darnell buying and selling stock. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says he bought 20 shares at $182.50 each. So, I need to calculate the total cost he incurred for those shares. To do that, I'll multiply the number of shares by the price per share. 

20 shares multiplied by $182.50 per share. Hmm, 20 times 180 is 3600, and 20 times 2.50 is 50. So, 3600 plus 50 is $3650. That's the total amount he spent on the stock.

Then, two months later, he sold all 20 shares at $168.75 each. I need to find the total revenue he got from selling the stock. So, again, multiplying the number of shares by the selling price. 20 times 168.75. Let me compute that. 

168 times 20 is 3360, and 0.75 times 20 is 15. So, adding those together gives 3360 +15 = $3375. So, he received $3375 from selling the stock.

Now, to find the loss per share, I subtract the selling price from the buying price. So, $182.50 minus $168.75. Let me do that subtraction. 

182.50 minus 168.75. Let's see, 182 minus 168 is 14, and 0.50 minus 0.75 is a negative 0.25. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, that's not how subtraction works with decimals. Oh, wait, 182.50 - 168.75 equals... Let me line them up:

182.50  
-168.75  
= ?

Starting from the right:

0 - 5 can't do, so borrow. 10 -5=5. Next, 4 (since we borrowed) -7: can't do, so borrow: 14-7=7. Next, 7 (after borrowing) -8: Can't do, borrow again: 17-8=9. Then, 7 (after borrowing) -6=1. And the top number is 1, so 1. So, 13.75. Wait, 182.50 - 168.75 equals 13.75. So, the loss per share is $13.75.

Now, to find the total loss, I multiply the loss per share by the number of shares. So, 20 shares multiplied by $13.75. Let me calculate that. 20 times 13 is 260, and 20 times 0.75 is 15. So, 260 +15 = $275. So, the total loss is $275.

Looking at the options, option C says $13.75 per share and $275 total loss. So the correct answer should be C.

The correct calculation involves:

1. **Total Cost**: 20 shares × $182.50 = $3650.
2. **Total Revenue**: 20 shares × $168.75 = $3375.
3. **Loss Per Share**: $182.50 - $168.75 = $13.75.
4. **Total Loss**: 20 × $13.75 = $275.

**Answer: C: $13.75 per share, $275.00 total loss.**

Answer: C
