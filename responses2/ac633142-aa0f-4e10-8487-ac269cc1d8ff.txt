Okay, so I have this physics problem here about velocities and the spaceship and the rocket. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think this through.

The question says a spaceship is moving away from Earth at 0.75c. Then it launches a rocket that also moves away from Earth at 0.75c relative to the spaceship. I need to find the rocket's velocity relative to Earth. The options are A to J, with some varying decimal values.

Wait, right, Einstein's velocity addition formula. Oh, right, because when you have objects moving at speeds close to c, you can't just add them like regular velocities. You have to use the relativistic addition formula. The formula is (u + v) / (1 + (uv)/c²), but I think that's when the velocities are in the same direction. Oh, wait, because the spaceship is moving away, and the rocket is also moving away from Earth, so their velocities are in the same direction, so we add them.

So the spaceship's velocity, v1, is 0.75c. The rocket's velocity relative to the spaceship, v2, is also 0.75c. So according to the formula, the rocket's velocity relative to Earth would be (0.75c + 0.75c) divided by (1 + (0.75c * 0.75c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Adding the velocities: 0.75 + 0.75 is 1.5c. But wait, wait, that's not right. Oh no, no, wait, the formula is (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)). So u is v1 which is 0.75c, and v is v2, which is 0.75c.

So numerator is 0.75c + 0.75c = 1.5c. Denominator is 1 + ( (0.75c)(0.75c) ) / c². Let's compute that denominator: (0.75)^2 is 0.5625. So denominator is 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625.

So the rocket's velocity is (1.5c) / 1.5625. Let's compute that. 1.5 divided by 1.5625 is equal to what? Let's do 1.5 / 1.5625. Hmm, 1.5 is 3/2, and 1.5625 is 25/16. So (3/2) ÷ (25/16) ) = (3/2) * (16/25) ) = (48)/(50) ) which is 24/25, which is 0.96.

Wait, so 24/25 is 0.96c. So the rocket's velocity is 0.96c. Looking at the options, option I is 0.96c. So the answer should be I.

To determine the velocity of the rocket relative to Earth, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.75c \) (velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth),
- \( v = 0.75c \) (velocity of the rocket relative to the spaceship).

Substituting the values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.75c + 0.75c}{1 + \frac{(0.75c)(0.75c)}{c^2}} = \frac{1.5c}{1 + 0.5625} = \frac{1.5c}{1.5625}
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625
\]

So,

\[
u' = \frac{1.5c}{1.5625} = \frac{3}{2} \div \frac{25}{16} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{16}{25} = \frac{48}{50} = 0.96c
\]

Thus, the velocity of the rocket relative to Earth is \( 0.96c \). The correct answer is **I: 0.96c**.
