Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the mode of a sample. Let me think through this step by step. First, I should remember what a mode is. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. If all values appear only once, then there's no mode. 

Looking at the numbers given: 14, 16, 21, 19, 18, 24, 17. Let me list them out to see if any numbers repeat. 

Hmm, 14 appears once. 16 is once. 21 once. 19 once. 18 once. 24 once. 17 once. So, none of these numbers are repeated. Each occurs only once. 

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "the mode of the sample." So in this case, since all numbers are unique, there's no mode. That would mean the correct answer is option A: no mode. 

But let me double-check. Did I miss any duplicates? Let me go through each number again. 14 – yeah, only one. 16 – no, only one. 21, 19, 18, 24, 17. None repeat. So, yes, all values are unique. 

Therefore, the mode doesn't exist, so the answer is A.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. In this sample, each number appears exactly once, so no number is repeated. Therefore, there is no mode.

Answer: A: no mode
