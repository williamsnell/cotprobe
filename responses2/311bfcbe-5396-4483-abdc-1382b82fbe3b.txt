Question:

The superintendent of a large school district asks the school psychologist to predict students' grade point averages (GPAs) for the first year of high school. The school psychologist has included achievement and aptitude scores as predictor variables for firstyear high school GPA in a regression analysis and is considering whether to also administer a school interest inventory and include those scores. The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?

Options:

A: The cost of administering the school interest inventory to all students
B: The correlation between the school interest inventory scores and the achievement test scores
C: The similarity between the school interest inventory scores and the aptitude test scores
D: The effect of the school interest inventory score on the students' second-year high school GPA
E: The correlation between the school interest inventory score and the students' middle school GPA
F: The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA
G: The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score
H: The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA
I: The time required to administer the school interest inventory
J: The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores

Okay, so I've got this question here about a school psychologist trying to predict a student's first-year high school GPA. The question is about whether to include a school interest inventory into the regression analysis. Hmm, I need to figure out the major concern the psychologist is facing when making this decision.

Let me read the question again. The superintendent wants to predict GPA, and the psychologist is considering adding the school interest inventory as a predictor. The options are A to J, each representing a different concern. I need to pick the right one.

So, what's the main concern here? Well, regression analysis aims to predict the dependent variable (GPA) using one or more independent variables (scores). The psychologist is considering adding more variables, but including them could have implications.

Option B is the correlation between the interest inventory and the aptitude test. That makes sense because if these two are highly correlated, they might be measuring the same construct or are redundant. Including both might not add much because they're capturing the same information.

Option C is about the similarity between the interest and aptitude scores. Similarity could mean they might be measuring different things, which is good because having separate scores can reduce multicollinearity. But the main concern is about including the inventory without it affecting the analysis too much.

Option D is about the effect of the interest inventory on second-year GPA. But the question is about predicting the first-year GPA, not the next year. So probably not the main concern here.

Option E talks about the correlation with middle school GPA. Wait, why would the interest inventory correlate with middle school GPA? The interest inventory is for high school, so maybe it's not directly related. Also, adding it might not help predict high school GPA.

Option F is the correlation with first-year GPA. If the interest inventory scores are highly correlated with the aptitude or achievement test scores, that's a problem. Including both might lead to multicollinearity, making it harder to interpret the individual effects. So maybe the concern is about the correlation between the interest inventory and the existing predictors.

Option G is the zero-order correlation between the interest and first-year GPA. Zero-order correlation is just the Pearson correlation between two variables, not considering other variables. So it's a measure of association. But I'm not sure how this relates to the decision to include the inventory.

Option H is the difference in multiple correlation when including the inventory. That sounds like it's about how much variance in GPA is explained by the inventory compared to just the aptitude test. This is a key concern in regressionâ€”whether the new variable adds significant predictive power. So if you include the inventory, you want to see if it improves the model's explanatory power.

Option I is about the time to administer, which doesn't seem directly related to whether to include the inventory or not.

Option J is the correlation between the interest and middle school GPA. Again, not directly relevant to first-year GPA prediction.

So putting this together, the major concern when adding a new predictor is likely about the impact it has on the model. If the interest inventory is highly correlated with existing predictors (aptitude or achievement), it can cause issues like multicollinearity, which makes the model less reliable, increasing standard errors and possibly making coefficients hard to interpret. Alternatively, if the interest inventory is a different construct, adding it could explain unique variance in GPA, which is good.

Which of these is the main concern? From what I remember, in regression, one key concern when adding a new variable is whether it adds significant predictive power beyond what's already captured by other variables. So the psychologist should check if the interest inventory has a significant correlation with the dependent variable (GPA) and also whether it's correlated with the existing predictors. But the question is about the main concern of the decision.

Looking at the options again, the most critical issue is whether the interest inventory is correlated with the existing variables. Because if it's highly correlated with the aptitude or achievement tests, it might not add much new information, leading to redundancy. Alternatively, if it's a different construct, it might explain more variance.

The question is asking which is the major concern. Another angle: the principal concern when adding variables is to avoid issues like multicollinearity (which affects the coefficients) and ensuring that the new variable isn't redundant (which can be detected by high correlations with existing variables).

So, the main concern is whether the interest inventory is correlated with the existing predictors. If it is, it could cause problems. So the answer should be option B: The correlation between the school interest inventory scores and the achievement test scores.

Wait, but what about the correlation with the aptitude test? That's another point. If the interest inventory is highly correlated with the aptitude, it's redundant. So the concern might be about whether the interest inventory is a different construct or not.

The question states that the psychologist is considering including the interest inventory as a predictor. The concern is about the impact of adding this variable. So the main concern is about whether it's adding unique variance. But the options don't directly say that; they list things to consider.

Wait, the question is about the major concern when making the decision to include the inventory. So what's the most critical thing to assess?

I think the key is to check the correlation between the interest inventory and the dependent variable (GPA). If it's not highly correlated, adding it won't add much. If it is, then it's a problem because it might be measuring the same construct or overlapping information.

But another angle: if the interest inventory is correlated with the existing predictors (aptitude or achievement tests), that could cause issues like changing the significance of other variables, leading to incorrect conclusions.

So which of the options captures this? Option B is about the correlation between the interest inventory and the tests. If that's high, it might not be a good idea. Alternatively, if it's uncorrelated with both, then it's a good addition.

Wait, the question isn't about whether the interest inventory is a good predictor, but the decision to include it. So the concern is about whether it's a useful addition. The critical thing is the correlation with other predictors.

Wait, but in regression, the primary concern is whether the new variable is a significant predictor and whether it's adding unique variance. But the options don't directly state that. The options are individual things.

So, the main concern when deciding to include a new variable is the correlation with the existing variables. Because high correlation with the existing variables can cause issues like multicollinearity, which makes the regression coefficients unstable and harder to interpret. So the psychologist would be concerned about the correlation between the interest inventory and the existing predictors (aptitude or achievement). Thus, the answer would be option B.

The school psychologist is considering adding a school interest inventory to predict first-year high school GPA. The major concern when making this decision is whether the interest inventory is correlated with the existing predictors (aptitude or achievement test scores). High correlations with these variables can lead to issues like multicollinearity, which affects the stability and interpretability of the regression coefficients. Therefore, the psychologist should assess the correlation between the interest inventory and the aptitude and achievement test scores to determine if it adds significant predictive value.
