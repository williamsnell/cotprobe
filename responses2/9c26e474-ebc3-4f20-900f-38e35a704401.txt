Okay, so I've got this question about discontinuous changes over the adult years. Hmm, I remember that discontinuous changes are things that don't happen smoothly. They're abrupt or sudden shifts rather than gradual. Let me think about each option.

The options are:
A: Personality
B: Skin elasticity
C: Physical strength
D: Male hormone levels
E: Hair color
F: Working memory
G: Female hormone levels
H: Male sexuality
I: Vision acuity
J: Sleep patterns

I'm trying to recall what each of these changes entails. Personality changes over time could be gradual, like through education or life experiences, so maybe not discontinuous. Skin elasticity changes more slowly, probably not it.

Physical strength—over time, especially as you grow, strength increases, so that's continuous. So C might not be the answer.

Hormone levels, like D, since they're regulated by the body and change over life stages. That's definitely a continuous change, not discontinuous.

E: Hair color—this changes with things like genetics, diet, environment. It's definitely a change that happens over time, probably smoothly, so not discontinuous.

Eyesight (F) can change with age and vision problems, but I think it's more gradual. So not the answer.

Male and female hormone levels (G and H) would definitely change over time, so not discontinuous.

Vision acuity (I) might change as you grow older, but it's more of a gradual process, so probably not it either.

Sleep patterns (J) can change, but I think they're influenced by daily routines and maybe even things like sleep disorders. That's a more continuous change.

So, the remaining options are A and B. Personality and skin elasticity. I'm not sure about these. Personality is probably more about individual development and changes over time, maybe even abrupt changes in certain areas. Skin elasticity is more about elasticity, which can change, but I think it's a more gradual process too.

Wait, maybe I should think again. Oh, I remember that changes in certain physical characteristics, like hair length, can have discontinuous changes, like when hair turns gray or becomes straight. But the options don't include hair length. Oh, E is hair color, which can change abruptly—like turning from brown to black. That's a discontinuous change. But wait, the options are E and another. Let me check the options again.

Ah, the options are A to J. The question is asking for an example of a discontinuous change. So E is hair color, which can change abruptly. But wait, I'm not sure if that's considered discontinuous. Another thought: maybe another option is better.

Wait, another option: working memory. I'm not sure. Working memory changes as you grow, perhaps with age. I think it's more continuous.

Wait, another thought—personality changes. For example, someone's introverted or extroverted can change over time. But I'm not sure if that's a discontinuous change. Maybe it's more gradual.

Another angle: discontinuous changes are abrupt. So looking for a characteristic that changes abruptly. 

Looking at E: Hair color. For example, someone's hair turning from light gray to black. That's a discontinuous change. 

Alternatively, maybe another option. Let me think about F: working memory. It can change as you learn new tasks, but is it a big, sudden change? Maybe not discontinuous. 

Wait, another thought—personality traits might have sudden shifts, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, another option: skin elasticity. That's usually more about elasticity, which can change, but maybe not in an abrupt way. I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct answer is E: Hair color. Because it's a characteristic that changes abruptly over time. For example, someone's hair could turn from brown to black, which is a big change, so discontinuous. 

But wait, another thought: maybe working memory (F) is an example. As you grow older, your working memory capacity can change, but I think it's more gradual. 

Alternatively, maybe skin elasticity (B) is a discontinuous change. For instance, someone's skin might become more elastic, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's the other way around. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to think of other examples. For instance, changes in height as you grow, but that's continuous. Changes in hair color as people age could have abrupt changes. So E seems like the best option.

The correct answer is E: Hair color. This characteristic changes abruptly over time, such as someone's hair transitioning from light to dark, making it a discontinuous change. 

Answer: E
