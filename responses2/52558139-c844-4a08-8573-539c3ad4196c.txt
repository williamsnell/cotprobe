Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the structures of two compounds: lithium acetylacetate and beryllium acetylacetate. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to figure this out step by step.

First, I'll read the question again. The question is asking what the differences in their properties suggest about their structures. The options are A to J, each making a different claim about their ionic nature, polarity, solubility, etc.

The question says that lithium acetylacetate has a very high melting point and is insoluble in chloroform. On the other hand, beryllium acetylacetate has a melting point of 108°C and a boiling point of 270°C, and it's soluble in chloroform.

So, let's think about the properties. Solubility in chloroform is a key factor. Chloroform is a polar solvent, right? And acetylacetate is a polar molecule because it's a carbonyl group with ester linkages. Both lithium and beryllium are metals, but wait, beryllium is less common in organic chemistry. Oh wait, but the key is the structure.

Wait, but ClCH3 is a solvent, so if the acetylacetate is soluble there, that suggests a certain polarity. Acetylacetate is a polar molecule, so it's likely to dissolve in polar solvents.

Now, looking at the melting points. If one has a higher melting point, that suggests a more ordered structure or a more stable compound. But wait, both are under 100°C as Li's melting point. Wait, no, Li's is very high, but beryllium is lower. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structures are different in terms of ionicity. Lithium is a metal, so it's a salt. Beryllium is a lighter metal, but it's less common because it's not as stable. Wait, but the structure doesn't have to be ionic. Maybe one is ionic and the other isn't.

Wait, but what about the solubility? Solubility in chloroform, which is a polar solvent, would suggest that the acetylacetate can form hydrogen bonds or have a high polarity. If Li's compound is soluble, perhaps its structure allows for such interactions.

Wait, but lithium acetylacetate might be a salt. Because I remember that lithium salts are often ionic. For example, NaCl is an ionic compound. So if Li is a metal, maybe Li(acetylacetate) is a salt, hence ionic.

What about beryllium? Be is a lighter metal but is it a metal or a metalloid? Be is less common, but maybe it's similar to metals in some way. Alternatively, Be might form a metalloid compound. But more importantly, if Be is part of an ionic compound, like Be(acetylacetate), then it would be ionic.

Wait, but the question is about their structures. So, if both are salts, they're ionic. Alternatively, maybe one is ionic and the other isn't.

Let me think about the properties. Solubility in chloroform suggests that the acetylacetate can form hydrogen bonds. That's typical for ionic compounds because ions can form strong hydrogen bonds. If Li's compound is soluble, maybe it's an ionic salt.

Another point is the melting points. Li's is very high, but Be's is 108-270. Wait, but 108°C is the melting point of BeO maybe? Or BeO is 2885°C. Wait, no. Wait, Be is in group 2, so perhaps the compounds are metal acetylacetates. So, the anions are acetylacetate ions, and the metal is Li or Be.

Wait, but Be is a lighter metal and could form a salt. So, the compounds would be Li(acetylacetate) and Be(acetylacetate). Are these ionic? Well, Li and Be are metals, and acetylacetate is a neutral molecule. So, Li(acetylacetate) would be Li+ and acetylacetate^-? Or maybe Li(acetylacetate) is Li+ + acetylacetate^-.

Wait, wait, but acetylacetate is (CH3CO)2CO, a neutral molecule. So if Li is a metal, it would form a cation and the anion would be the same as acetylacetate. So Li(acetylacetate) would be Li+ and (CH3CO)2CO^-? No, wait, that's not right. Because acetylacetate is neutral, so Li(acetylacetate) would dissociate as Li+ + (CH3CO)2CO.

But wait, the actual structure might be Li(acetylacetate) as a salt, Li+ and the anion. So, if that's the case, it would be an ionic compound because it's a metal and a non-metal.

On the other hand, Be(acetylacetate) would have Be^+ (if it's a metal acetylacetate) and (CH3CO)2CO^- as an anion. Be^+ is a cation, so this would also be an ionic compound. So both are ionic.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps Be(acetylacetate) is a non-ionic compound because Be is a metal but perhaps doesn't form a cation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Be(acetylacetate) is a salt because Be is a metal, so it would have a cation. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the compounds are ionic because the anion is acetylacetate, and the cation is Li or Be. So both are ionic. 

Looking back at the options: option B says both are ionic and non-ionic. Option C says both are ionic. 

Wait, but Li is a metal, and Be is a lighter metal. So in the case of Be, perhaps it's more likely to form a ionic compound because Be is less electronegative than Li. Wait, Li is more electronegative, so it would tend to form a cation. Similarly, Be would form a cation. So both would form ionic compounds.

But wait, another thought: the solubility in chloroform suggests that the acetylacetate is polar and can form H-bonds. So, if Li's compound is a salt of Li+ and acetylacetate, then it would be more likely to be ionic and have strong H-bonds.

Wait, the question is about their structures. So, if both are ionic, that would mean options B or C. Let's look at the options.

Option B: both are non-ionic and ionic. But we're thinking they're ionic.

Option C: both are ionic. So that's possible.

Looking at the melting points. The Li's is very high, so perhaps Li is more polarizable, allowing it to form strong intermolecular forces. Be's melting point is 108°C, which is the melting point of some ionic compounds like NaCl, which is around 800°C. Wait, NaCl is 800°C. BeO is 2885°C. So, Be's melting point is much lower. That might be because Be is a lighter metal, so less polarizable than Li.

But Be's anion is still a weak acid, I think. Acetylacetate is a weak acid as well. So, perhaps both are ionic, but Li is more polarizable, so it has a higher melting point.

Alternatively, maybe the melting points are more about the strength of the ionic bonding. LiCl is a strong ionic compound with high melting points, but BeCl2 might be lower. But BeCl2's melting point is around 100°C, while LiCl is higher. So maybe Be's compound is more polar, perhaps lower in melting point because of weaker ionic bonds? Wait, LiCl is much higher, but BeCl2 is lower. Hmm, maybe the structure isn't the main factor here.

Wait, but the question is about the structures, not the properties. So, perhaps the structures being ionic is the key.

Now, regarding the solubility. Both compounds are polar. So, if Li's compound is soluble in chloroform, which is a polar solvent, that suggests it's a strong polar molecule. But Li's compound is a salt, which is generally more soluble in polar solvents than ionic compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Be's compound is more polar, so it's more soluble. Wait, but Be's compound is a salt as well. So, perhaps the solubility is more about the ability to form strong intermolecular forces, not the polarity of the molecule itself.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other options. Option G says both are volatile at room temperature, which Li's is very high, but Be's melting point is 108°C, which is lower than room temp. So, Be's would melt at room temp, maybe. So, Li's would be a solid, and Be's a liquid. So, their properties about volatility aren't the same. So option G says both are volatile. G is incorrect.

Option E: Be is polymeric due to hydrogen bonding, Li is not. So, if Li is a salt, maybe it's not polymeric. Hmm. But Li's compound is likely ionic, as I thought earlier. So E doesn't seem right.

Option I: Li is polymeric, Be is not. But lithium is a metal, so it's more likely to form a salt, not a polymeric compound. So I's wrong.

Option J: Both are polymeric. But Li's compound is a salt, not polymeric. So J is wrong.

Option H: Li is ionic or salt-like, Be is non-ionic or covalent. But Be is a metal, so it's non-ionic. So H is incorrect.

Option F: Both are similar in ionic character and solubility. But Li's compound is very high in melting point, so not similar. Also, Be's melting is 108, which is not high. So F is probably wrong.

Option D: Li's is soluble due to polar nature, Be's not. But both are polar. So D says Li is soluble and Be isn't. But that's not the case. So D is incorrect.

Option A: Both are non-ionic. We thought they're ionic, so A is incorrect.

So the remaining options are B, C, and F.

Wait, but the question is about their structures. So if both are ionic, that's option C. Otherwise, B or F. But what's the right reasoning.

Another approach: The solubility in chloroform suggests that the compound is a strong polar solvent. So, if Li's compound is soluble, it's likely to have a strong ionic character. Similarly, if Be's is not, that could mean it's a weaker ionic compound or a non-ionic one. 

Li's compound is a salt, so it's likely to be ionic. So the compounds are ionic. So C is the right answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says both are ionic. That makes sense.

Wait, but another point: Be is a lighter metal. So, perhaps Be forms a cation, like BeCl2, but Li forms a cation as LiCl. But the solubility might not be directly tied to the size of the cation.

Alternatively, perhaps Li's compound is more polar because it's a salt with a more polar anion, which is acetylacetate.

So, putting it all together, the structures are both ionic. So the correct option is C.

The question compares lithium acetylacetate and beryllium acetylacetate in terms of their properties to infer their structural characteristics. The key points are as follows:

1. **Solubility in Chloroform**: Acetylacetate is a polar molecule, and both compounds are soluble in chloroform, a polar solvent. This suggests that both compounds are polar and likely to form strong intermolecular forces, which is consistent with ionic compounds.

2. **Melting Points**: Lithium acetylacetate has a very high melting point, while beryllium acetylacetate has a lower melting point (108°C). This difference is likely due to the polar nature of acetylacetate and the ability of Li+ (a cation) to form strong ionic bonding compared to Be+ (a cation).

3. **Structural Inference**: Both compounds are likely to be ionic. Lithium acetylacetate forms a salt (Li+ and acetylacetate^-), while beryllium acetylacetate forms a salt (Be+ and acetylacetate^-). Ionic compounds are typically salts because metals like Li and Be readily form cations, while Be is less common but still forms a cation.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Both compounds are not non-ionic; they are ionic.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. While both are ionic, they are not necessarily non-ionic.
   - **Option C**: Correct. Both compounds are ionic.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. Li acetylacetate is highly soluble in chloroform due to its strong ionic character, while beryllium acetylacetate is not.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. Li acetylacetate is not polymeric; it is likely ionic. Be acetylacetate is not polymeric.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. Both compounds are not similar in terms of ionic character or solubility.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. Be acetylacetate is not non-ionic; it is ionic.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Li acetylacetate is ionic, not salt-like.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. Li acetylacetate is ionic, not polymeric.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. Li acetylacetate is not polymeric; it is ionic.

Thus, the correct answer is that both compounds are ionic.
