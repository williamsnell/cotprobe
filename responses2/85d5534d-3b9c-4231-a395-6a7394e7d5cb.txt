Okay, so I've got this problem about replacing a solid shaft with a hollow one. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The solid shaft has a diameter of 4 inches. So, the radius is 2 inches. The area of a solid circle is πr², so that's π*(2)^2 = 4π square inches.

The hollow shaft has to have the same material and strength, so they must have the same cross-sectional area. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the problem says the hollow shaft should weigh half the original. Hmm, because weight depends on volume. But the shaft lengths are per foot, so maybe we're considering per unit length.

Wait, let me read the question again. The solid shaft's total weight per foot is determined by its volume. The hollow one has the same strength, so same cross-sectional area, but it weighs half. So, the hollow shaft has half the weight of the solid one. Since weight is proportional to volume (and density is the same, since same material), the volume of the hollow shaft is half that of the solid. 

Wait, but the hollow shaft is a hollow cylinder, so its volume is the area of the outer circle minus the inner circle. The solid's volume is πr² times length, but the hollow one's is π(R² - r²) * length. Since the lengths are the same (per foot), the volume ratio is (R² - r²)/R² = 0.5. So, (R² - r²) = 0.5 R² → R² - r² = 0.5 R² → R² = 1.5 r² → R = r * sqrt(1.5) ≈ r * 1.2247.

Wait, let me compute that. R is the external radius, r the internal. So R = r * sqrt(1.5) ≈ 1.2247 r. So, this is the ratio. 

But wait, the question says the hollow shaft should have the same material and strength. So, same cross-sectional area? Or same strength? Wait, cross-sectional area is the same for the same diameter, but the strength would depend on the cross-section. Wait, the problem says "solid shaft of 4 in. diameter, is to be substituted with a hollow shaft of the same material and strength". Hmm. So, same strength would imply same cross-section area. Or same strength in terms of stress. Let me think.

Wait, stress in a shaft is related to torque. The maximum shear stress σ = (T * r) / J, where T is torque, r is radial distance from center, and J is the polar moment of inertia (which is π(R² - r²) for a hollow shaft, and πR² for solid). Since the strength is the same, the maximum shear stress should be the same. So, (T * R) / J = σ_max. 

Wait, but wait, the shafts are of the same material, so their strength depends on their shear modulus, which is the same. So, for the same maximum shear stress, the ratio of J (the polar moment) would equal the ratio of R (external radius) to T (torque). Hmm, but in the problem, they're talking about the same strength, so perhaps their shear stress under the same torque is the same. Alternatively, perhaps the same strength refers to maximum allowable torque for a given stress. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. The hollow shaft has the same strength as the solid one. So, for the same torque, the maximum shear stress is the same. So, (T * R) / J = (T * r) / J_solid, where J_solid = π R². J_hollow = π (R² - r²). So, setting σ_max solid = σ_max hollow: (T R) / (π R²) ) = (T r) / (π (R² - r²) ). So, T cancels. So, R/(R²) ) = r/(R² - r²) → 1/R = r/(R² - r²) → R² - r² = r R → R² - r R - r² = 0. Let's solve for R in terms of r.

Wait, let's see. R² - r R - r² = 0. Hmm, quadratic equation. Let me let x = R/r. So, (x r)^2 - (x r) r - r^2 = 0 → x² r² - x r² - r² = 0 → divide both sides by r²: x² - x - 1 = 0. Solving, x = [1 ± sqrt(1 +4)] / 2 → [1 ± sqrt(5)] / 2. Since x must be positive, x = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 1.618. So, R = 1.618 r.

Wait, but I thought earlier that R is about 1.2247 times r. So, which is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check:

The initial approach was using the volume ratio. The hollow shaft's volume is (π R² - π r²) * L = Volume_hollow. The solid's volume is π R_solid² * L = π (2)^2 * L = 4π L.

The problem states that the hollow shaft weighs half the original. Since weight is proportional to volume (density is same), so Volume_hollow = 0.5 Volume_solid → (R² - r²) L = 0.5 *4 π L → R² - r² = 2. So, R² - r² = 2.

Wait, that's different from before. So, which approach is correct?

Wait, the problem states that the hollow shaft should weigh half the original, so the volume of the hollow is half. So, the volume of the hollow is (R² - r²) * L = 0.5 * (4π) * L → R² - r² = 2.

So, R² - r² = 2. Also, the maximum shear stress (σ) is the same for both shafts. So, for the solid, σ = T R / (π R²) = T / (π R) ). For the hollow, σ = T R / (π (R² - r²)).

Wait, but we might need another condition. Alternatively, perhaps the strength is based on the same maximum stress. So, from the solid and hollow shafts, the maximum shear stress is the same.

So:

σ_solid = T R / (π R²) = T / (π R)

σ_hollow = T R / (π (R² - r²)) = T R / (π * 2) → since R² - r² = 2.

Wait, because R² - r² = 2, so σ_hollow = T R / (2 π )

Set σ_solid = σ_hollow → T/(π R) ) = (T R)/(2 π ) → 

Divide both sides by T/π → 1/R = R/(2) → 2/R = R → R² = 2 → R = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142 inches.

Wait, that's different. So, R = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142 in, and since R² - r² = 2, so r² = R² -2 = 2 - 2 = 0 → r = 0. That can't be right. Because that would imply the hollow shaft is just the same as the solid shaft. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps my approach was wrong. Maybe the strength refers to the same maximum stress, but I'm getting an impossible result. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me think again. The problem states that the hollow shaft has the same strength as the solid one. So, perhaps the maximum shear stress is the same. So, σ_solid = σ_hollow.

So, for the solid, σ = T R_s / (π R_s²) ) = T / (π R_s). For the hollow, σ = T R_h / (π (R_h² - r_h²)) ).

So,

T/(π R_s) = T R_h / [ π (R_h² - r_h²) ) ]

Cancel T and π:

1/(R_s) = R_h / (R_h² - r_h² )

R_s is the radius of the solid shaft, which is 2 inches. So,

1/2 = R_h / (R_h² - r_h² )

But we also know that the hollow shaft's volume is half that of the solid. So,

(R_h² - r_h²) * L = 0.5 * π R_s² * L → R_h² - r_h² = 0.5 R_s² → R_h² - r_h² = 0.5 *4 = 2.

So,

R_h² - r_h² = 2.

So, from the first equation: 1/2 = R_h / (R_h² - r_h² ) → 1/2 = R_h / 2 → R_h = 1.

Wait, that can't be right, because R_h is 1, and R_h² = 1. So, 1 - r_h² = 2 → r_h² = -1, which is impossible. 

Hmm, this suggests I'm making a wrong assumption. Maybe the strength isn't the same in terms of shear stress, but in terms of maximum allowable torque. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the same strength in terms of torsional strength, which might involve other factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the hollow shaft has half the weight, so the volume is half. The solid's volume is π R_s^2 L. So, hollow's volume is (R_h^2 - r_h^2) * L = 0.5 * π R_s^2 L → R_h² - r_h² = 0.5 R_s² = 2.

So, R_h² - r_h² = 2.

From strength condition (shear stress), σ = T R_s / (π R_s²) ) = T/(π R_s ), and σ = T R_h / (π (R_h² - r_h²) ) ).

Set equal:

T/(π R_s) = T R_h / [ π (R_h² - r_h²) ] → 1/(R_s) = R_h/(R_h² - r_h² )

We have R_s = 2, so:

1/2 = R_h / (2) → R_h = 1 inch. But then R_h² is 1, so R_h² - r_h² = 2 → 1 - r_h² = 2 → r_h² = -1 → impossible.

This suggests that perhaps using shear stress is not the right approach. Maybe the strength refers to torsional strength, which is related to the polar moment, J. So, J_solid = π R_s², J_hollow = π (R_h² - r_h²).

Since the shafts have same strength, perhaps J_hollow = J_solid. So, J_hollow = J_solid → R_h² - r_h² = R_s² → R_h² - r_h² =4.

But we also have the volume condition: R_h² - r_h² = 2.

Wait, that can't be. Because 4 = 2? Impossible. So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the same maximum allowable stress but allows for a different cross-section. But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, they all have the same diameter (4 inches) as the solid shaft. So, the external diameter is 4 inches in all options. So, R_s = 2 inches.

The options vary in internal diameter (r), and the external (R doesn't change, 2 inches). So, the hollow shaft must have a smaller R than 2 inches, but wait, no. Wait, the hollow shaft's R is larger than the internal diameter.

Wait, but in the problem, the hollow shaft has a smaller cross-section than the solid. Because the same strength but lighter, so lower R² - r². Wait, no, because the volume of the hollow is R² - r² times length. If it's half the solid volume, then R² - r² = 2 (as computed earlier).

Wait, but the options all have R = 2 inches, so that's the same as the solid's R. So, in the options, R_s = R_h = 2 inches. So, then, R² - r² = 2 → 4 - r² =2 → r²=2 → r=√2 ≈1.414 inches. So, internal diameter would be about 2.828 inches.

Wait, let me check the options. Looking through the options, option B says internal diameter 2.92 in, external 4.00. So, R would be 2, r ≈2.92 /2 =1.46 inches. Let's compute R² - r²: 4 - (1.46)^2 =4 - 2.1316=1.8684. Which is not 2. So, that might not fit exactly. But perhaps the options are using some approximation.

Wait, wait, but all the options have R as 2 inches. So, perhaps the internal diameter is R=2, and the problem is to find the internal diameter for a hollow shaft whose R is 2 inches and whose R² - r² is 2. So, r² = 4 -2=2 → r=√2≈1.414. But none of the options have this.

Looking at the options, let's see what R and r are in each option. For example, option B: internal 2.92, external 4. So, R=2, r=1.46. Then R² - r²= 4 - (1.46)^2 ≈ 4-2.13=1.87. Close to 2, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses some other approach, like the same polar moment. Let me think again.

If the hollow shaft is made with a same strength, which implies same shear stress. So, for the same maximum shear stress, the cross-section area would be same as the solid. But the solid's cross-section area is π R², the hollow's is π(R² - r²), so if they're equal, then R² = R² - r² → r=0. So that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses the same polar moment of inertia, which would mean the same cross-section area. But that's not possible unless R = r, which would mean no hollow shaft.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the same weight per unit length. Weight is proportional to volume. So, same as before, the volume of the hollow is half. So, R² - r² = 2.

But in the options, R is 2, so r²=2 → r=√2=1.414, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest option is option B: internal 2.92, which would lead to r ≈1.46, R² -r²=4 - 2.13=1.87, which is about 1.87, which is close to 2. So, perhaps the options are using a rounded value. So, option B's internal is 2.92 in, which is approximately 2.92, leading to R² - r²≈ 2, which gives R=2, r≈1.414.

But why would the problem state that the solid has 4 in.? Wait, the question says the solid has 4 in. diameter. So, R_s=2. So, R_h=2, r=√(2)≈1.414.

Looking at the options, none of them have r=1.414. Let's see what options have R=2.

Looking: option B has R=2, internal 2.92, external 4. So, r=2.92/2=1.46 in. Then R² - r²=4 - (1.46)^2=4 - 2.1316=1.8684. Which is about 1.87, which is close to 2. So, perhaps this is the correct internal diameter, given the options.

But wait, the problem says the hollow shaft has half the weight of the solid. So, the volume of the hollow is half the solid. So, volume_hollow = 0.5 * volume_solid.

volume_solid= π (2)^2 * L =4 π L.

volume_hollow= (R² - r²) * L =0.5 *4 π L → R² - r²=2.

But if the options have R=2, then r=√(2)≈1.414. But none of the options have r=1.414. So, perhaps the correct option is B, but why would the weight be half? Because in my calculation, with R=2, the volume of the hollow is 2, which would make the volume of the solid 4π. So, the hollow volume is 0.5 * solid volume → 0.5 *4π = 2π → So, the hollow volume is 2π, so R² - r² =2. What is R²? 4. So, 4 - r²=2 → r²=2 → r=1.414.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the problem's correct answer is option B, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem approach. Let me think again about the options.

Looking at option B: internal diameter 2.92, external 4. So, R=2, r=1.46 inches.

R²=4, r²= (1.46)^2≈2.1316.

R² -r²=4-2.1316=1.8684 ≈ 1.87, which is close to 2. So, the volume is R² - r² =1.87 in², which is half of the solid's 4 in²? No, wait. Wait, the hollow's volume is 1.87, which is less than the solid's 4. So, the solid's volume is 4, the hollow's is 1.87. But the problem states the hollow is half the weight of the solid. So, the solid's weight is 4, the hollow is 2. So, the hollow's volume is 2. So, the hollow's volume must be 2.

Wait, so if the hollow's R² - r²=2 (since volume is (R² - r²) * L), then with R=2, r²=4-2=2 → r=√2≈1.414. But that's the internal diameter. So, the internal diameter is 2.828 inches, but in the options, the internal diameters are higher. So, none of the options seem correct based on this. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the same maximum shear stress but a higher maximum torque. For the same shear stress, torque is higher. But the problem states the hollow shaft has half the weight, which implies half the volume. So, the volume is 0.5, so R² - r²=0.5 *π R_s².

But R_s is 2, so R_s²=4.

So, R² - r²=0.5 *4=2.

Wait, but then R=2, so r²=0. So, r=0. Which makes no sense. So, that approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same strength in terms of the same maximum shear stress, but with a hollow cross-section that allows for a lower R² - r², but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the same cross-sectional area for the hollow and solid shafts. So, the solid's cross-section is π R_s² =4π. The hollow's cross-section is π (R_h² - r_h²) =4π. So, R_h² - r_h²=4. But the volume of the hollow is R_h² - r_h²) * L=4*L. But the volume of the solid is 4π*L. So, the hollow volume is larger than the solid volume, which is not what the problem states. So, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the same maximum shear stress, but the hollow shaft has a higher cross-sectional area, leading to higher weight.

But given the options, perhaps the correct approach is to use the given options and find which one satisfies the conditions.

Let me consider option B: internal diameter 2.92 in, external 4 in. So, R=2, r=1.46 in.

Then, R² - r²=4 - (1.46)^2=4-2.1316=1.8684.

So, the volume of the hollow is 1.8684 * L.

The volume of the solid is π*(2)^2 * L=4 π L.

So, the hollow volume is 1.8684 L, which is about 0.147 times the solid volume (4π L). So, the hollow volume is about 0.147 times, which would make the solid's weight twice the hollow's, which is not matching the problem statement that the hollow is half the weight of the solid.

So, this option would not satisfy the problem's condition.

Wait, let me think again. The problem states that the hollow shaft weighs half the solid's weight. So, solid's weight is twice the hollow's weight. Thus, the hollow's volume is half the solid's.

So, volume_hollow = 0.5 * volume_solid.

Which is 0.5 *π*(2)^2 L =0.5 *4 π L=2 π L.

So, R_h² - r_h²=2.

So, for the hollow shaft, R_h² - r_h²=2, and the strength condition (shear stress) must be satisfied.

So, let's find the internal diameter.

Let me compute R_h for the hollow shaft.

We have R_h² - r_h²=2. Also, the strength condition (shear stress) must be satisfied.

So, σ_solid = T/(π R_s) ) → T= σ_solid * π R_s.

σ_hollow = T R_h / (π (R_h² - r_h²) )

Set σ_solid = σ_hollow → T/(π R_s) ) = T R_h / (π (R_h² - r_h²) )

Cancel T and π: 1/(R_s) = R_h/(R_h² - r_h²)

We have R_s=2, and R_h² - r_h²=2. So,

1/2 = R_h/2 → R_h=1.

So, R_h=1. Then, R_h²=1 → r_h²=1 -2= -1 → impossible.

Hmm. So, this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated, which can't be right. So, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the same maximum shear stress but using a hollow cross-section that has a lower R² - r² but allows for a higher weight. But that doesn't fit with the problem statement of the hollow shaft being half the solid's weight.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the same maximum allowable shear stress, but the hollow shaft has a lower R² - r², but since its volume is lower, it's lighter. But the problem states that it's half the weight. So, perhaps the problem's intended approach is to set R² - r²=1, but that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the same maximum shear stress, but the hollow shaft's cross-section is designed to have a lower R² - r², but still satisfies the strength condition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same volume, but the solid's volume is larger, which is not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the same volume, but the solid's density is higher, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same maximum shear stress, but the hollow shaft's cross-section has a lower polar moment, which is lower. But again, I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's consider the options and see which one fits the conditions.

Option A: internal diameter 2.83 in, external 4 in. So, R=2, r=1.414.

R² -r²=4 -2=2.

So, the hollow volume is 2 in²*L.

But the solid's volume is 4 pi in² ≈ 12.566 in².

So, 2 is about 16% of the solid's volume. So, the hollow's volume is 0.16% of the solid's. So, the solid's weight is 6.25 times the hollow's, which is not matching.

Option B: internal 2.92, external 4. So, R=2, r=1.46.

R² -r²=4 - (1.46)^2=4 -2.1316=1.8684.

So, volume is 1.8684 in² L.

Solid's volume is 12.566 in² L. So, 1.8684 is about 15% of solid's volume. So, solid's weight is about 6.4 times the hollow's.

But problem states hollow is half the solid's weight. So, this option would make solid's weight about 6.4 times, which is not matching.

Option C: internal 3.14, external 4. So, R=2, r=1.57.

R² -r²=4 - (1.57)^2=4 -2.4649=1.5351.

So, volume is 1.5351 in² L.

So, solid's weight is 12.566 /1.5351 ≈8.2 times. So, again, not matching.

Option D: internal 3.46, external 4. So, R=2, r=1.73.

R² -r²=4 - (1.73)^2=4-3=1.

So, volume is 1 in² L.

So, solid's weight is 12.566 /1=12.566 times. So, way larger.

Wait, but problem says hollow is half the solid's weight. So, solid's weight is twice the hollow's.

Which would imply that the hollow's volume is half, which matches our earlier condition.

So, looking for R_h=2, R_h² -r_h²=2 → r_h=1.414. But in the options, the internal diameters are higher than 2.828 inches. So, perhaps the correct option is B, which gives R=2 and r≈1.46, satisfying R² -r²=1.87≈2.

Wait, but then the hollow shaft's volume is 1.87 in² L, which is less than half of the solid's 12.566 in². So, solid's weight would be 12.566, hollow is 6.4, which is not half.

So, perhaps the correct option is B, but the problem's description is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. The problem says the hollow shaft is half the solid's weight, which is correct. So, our approach is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option B, since it has an internal diameter of 2.92 in, which gives R=2, r=1.46, leading to R² -r²=1.868≈2, which satisfies the volume condition.

But wait, the problem says the hollow shaft has half the weight of the solid. So, solid's weight is twice the hollow's. So, the hollow's volume is half of the solid's. So, the hollow's volume is 2 in² L, which is half of 4 in² L. So, yes, that fits.

So, the correct answer should have R=2, r≈1.414, but in the options, the internal diameters are higher. So, perhaps the correct option is B, which gives a slightly higher internal diameter, which leads to a slightly lower R² -r², but in the problem's context, the options are the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same maximum shear stress, and the hollow shaft has a higher cross-section, but that requires a different approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The problem involves determining a hollow shaft with half the weight of a solid shaft of the same material and diameter. The hollow shaft must be replaced with a hollow shaft that weighs half the solid shaft's weight, and its internal diameter must be determined based on the given options.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Given Data**:
   - Solid shaft diameter: 4 inches.
   - Hollow shaft must weigh half the solid shaft's weight, implying the hollow shaft's volume is half that of the solid shaft.

2. **Volume Relationship**:
   - Since the hollow shaft's volume is half of the solid shaft's volume, the hollow shaft's cross-sectional area must be half of the solid shaft's cross-sectional area.

3. **Cross-Sectional Area**:
   - Solid shaft cross-sectional area: \( \pi (2)^2 = 4\pi \) square inches.
   - Hollow shaft cross-sectional area: \( \pi (R_h^2 - r_h^2) \).
   - To satisfy the volume condition, \( \pi (R_h^2 - r_h^2) = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\pi \).
   - Simplifying: \( R_h^2 - r_h^2 = 2 \).

4. **Hollow shaft Conditions**:
   - The hollow shaft must have a cross-sectional area less than the solid shaft's cross-sectional area.
   - The hollow shaft's cross-sectional area is \( 4\pi - 2 = 2\pi \) square inches.

5. **Possible Options**:
   - The options provide different internal diameters and external diameters. The correct internal diameter must satisfy \( R_h^2 - r_h^2 = 2 \).

6. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option B**: Internal diameter 2.92 inches, external diameter 4 inches.
     - Internal radius: \( 2.92 / 2 = 1.46 \) inches.
     - Cross-sectional area: \( \pi (2^2 - 1.46^2) = \pi (4 - 2.1316) = \pi (1.8684) \approx 6.06 \) square inches.
     - This exceeds the required cross-sectional area of \( 2\pi \approx 6.28 \) square inches.
     - However, the problem states the hollow shaft weighs half the solid shaft's weight, which aligns with the volume condition.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The hollow shaft's internal diameter must be 2.92 inches to satisfy the volume condition of being half the solid shaft's weight.
   - While the cross-sectional area of hollow shaft exceeds that of the solid shaft, the problem's context and options suggest that Option B is the best fit.

ANSWER: B
