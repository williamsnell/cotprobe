Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding an immediate consequence in propositional logic (PL) from the given premises. The premises are:

1. (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q)
2. P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O)
3. N ⊃ P

And the options are A to J, each a different proposition. I need to figure out which one is a direct consequence of these premises.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down each premise and see what we can infer.

First, let's list the premises again for clarity:

Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)
Premise 2: P → (N → ~O)
Premise 3: N → P

I think the best approach is to use rules of inference to derive new propositions from these. Maybe we can chain them together or use hypothetical syllogism or something like that.

Let me see what each premise tells us.

Premise 3 is N → P. So if N is true, then P must be true. That might be helpful.

Premise 2 is P → (N → ~O). So if P is true, then N → ~O must be true. Wait, so if P is true, then N implies ~O. But from Premise 3, if N is true, then P is true. So combining these, if N is true, P is true, but then from Premise 2, since P is true, N → ~O must hold. So if N is true, then ~O must be true. So N → ~O. Wait, but from Premise 3, N → P, so if N is true, P is true, and from Premise 2, if P is true, N must imply ~O. So that's consistent.

But wait, can I chain these implications? Let me think: if N → P, and P → (N → ~O), then combining these, we can get N → (P → (N → ~O)). Then using hypothetical syllogism, if A → B and B → C, then A → C. So N → (P → (N → ~O)) would allow us to chain the implications.

Wait, but that seems a bit complex. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Looking at Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So if (N → ~O) is true, then (O ∨ Q) must be true. So whenever N implies not O, then either O is true or Q is true.

But from Premise 3, N → P. So if N is true, then P is true. But P → (N → ~O) is Premise 2. So if P is true, then N → ~O must be true. So if N is true, then P is true, and N → ~O is true. Which would mean N is true, so ~O is true, so O is false.

Wait, so if N is true, then O is false. So N → ~O is true. So then, according to Premise 1, that would make O ∨ Q true. But if O is false, then Q must be true. So when N is true, Q must be true.

So N → Q. But wait, the premises don't directly give us N → Q; we have N → P, and from N→P and P→(N→~O), and then from N→~O and thus O→Q (because O is false, so O ∨ Q is true). So N→Q seems to be a consequence.

Wait, but let me think again. If N is true, then P is true (from Premise 3). And from Premise 2, since P is true, N → ~O must be true. So if N is true, then ~O is true, so O is false. So when O is false, O ∨ Q is true, which requires Q to be true. So N → Q holds. So N → Q is a consequence.

Alternatively, maybe I can derive N → Q directly.

Let me try to show that.

Premise 3: N → P

Premise 2: P → (N → ~O)

So combining these, using hypothetical syllogism: N → (P → (N → ~O)).

But then, applying hypothetical syllogism again, since P → (N→~O) and N→P, we can derive N → (P → (N → ~O)) → N → (N → ~O). Wait, perhaps I'm not doing that correctly. Maybe I should directly chain the implications.

Wait, let's try to get N → Q.

If N is true, then from Premise 3, P is true.

From Premise 2, since P is true, N → ~O must be true. So if N is true (as in this case), then ~O is true, so O is false.

Now, in Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). Since (N → ~O) is true (because N is true and ~O is true), then the conclusion O ∨ Q must be true. But O is false, so Q must be true. So when N is true, Q is true. Therefore, N → Q holds.

So if N is true, Q must be true. So N → Q is a consequence.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural deduction:

From Premise 3, N → P.

From Premise 2, since P is true (from N → P), then N → ~O must be true. So N → ~O is true.

Now, from Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). Since (N → ~O) is true, so (O ∨ Q) must be true.

But O is false (because N → ~O is true, so when N is true, O must be false). So if O is false, then Q must be true to satisfy O ∨ Q.

Thus, when N is true, Q is true. So N → Q.

So N → Q is a consequence.

Looking back at the options, option C is N → Q. So that's a possible answer.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Because sometimes when you chain implications, you might have to consider the implications of each premise.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the premises to derive another conclusion.

Looking at the premises again:

Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)

Premise 2: P → (N → ~O)

Premise 3: N → P

I can also look at Premise 1 and see if I can derive something else. 

So, Premise 1 is (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). Let's see, if (N → ~O) is true, then O ∨ Q is true. But from Premise 2, if P is true, then N → ~O is true. So when P is true, then N → ~O is true, which in turn requires that O is false (since N is true, so ~O is true). So in that case, O is false, so O ∨ Q is Q. So when P is true, O is false, so O ∨ Q is Q. But we don't have P as a premise, so I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, maybe I can use another approach. Let's see, can I derive Q from the premises?

If I can derive Q, then Q is a consequence. Since we have N → Q, which is an immediate consequence.

Alternatively, let's try to use the premises to see if we can derive Q.

We have Premise 3: N → P.

And from that, since P → (N → ~O), then combining, N → (P → (N → ~O)).

Wait, perhaps using the hypothetical syllogism: if N → P and P → (N → ~O), then N → (N → ~O). But that seems a bit circular.

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Hypothetical syllogism says that if A → B and B → C, then A → C. So in this case, if we have N → P and P → (N → ~O), then we can chain them to get N → (N → ~O). But that doesn't help us directly. Because N → (N → ~O) is just a restatement of N → ~O, which we already have.

Wait, perhaps that's not the way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can derive N → Q.

Earlier, I thought that when N is true, Q must be true. So N → Q is a consequence. Therefore, option C is correct.

Let me check the other options to see if any of them are also consequences.

Option A: P → O. Hmm, can I derive that?

Well, from Premise 3, N → P. And from Premise 2, P → (N → ~O). So if P is true, then N → ~O is true. But then, if N is true, ~O is true, so O is false. So if P is true, then O is false. So P → ~O. But that's not the same as P → O. So I don't think P → O is a consequence.

Option B: O ∨ Q. Well, that's already given in Premise 1 as a consequence. But the question is about an immediate consequence, so perhaps more specific.

Option C: N → Q, which I think we've established is a consequence.

Option D: O ∨ P. Hmm, could that be derived?

Well, from the premises, let's see. If I can derive O ∨ P, that would be D.

From Premise 3: N → P.

From Premise 2: P → (N → ~O). So if P is true, then N → ~O.

If P is true, then from Premise 1, (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). But since N → ~O is true (because P is true, so N → ~O is true), then O ∨ Q is true. But O is false (because N → ~O is true, so N is true, so ~O is true, so O is false). So O ∨ Q is true, which requires Q. So when P is true, Q must be true. But O is false, so O ∨ Q is Q, which is true. But how does that help us with O ∨ P?

Hmm, perhaps another approach. If I can find a way to show that O ∨ P is necessarily true.

Wait, from Premise 2, P → (N → ~O). And from Premise 3, N → P.

So if P is true, then N → ~O is true. So if P is true, then N must be false? Wait, no. Wait, N → ~O is equivalent to (N is false) OR (~O is true). So if N is true, then ~O is true; if N is false, then the implication is still true regardless of O.

Wait, but if P is true, then N must be such that N → ~O is true. So if P is true, then N is either false or ~O is true. So if N is true, then ~O is true. If N is false, ~O can be either way.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let's try to see if O ∨ P is a consequence.

Suppose O is true. Then O ∨ P is true. So if O is true, the proposition holds. If O is false, then for O ∨ P to be true, P must be true.

So let's see if P can be false under the premises.

Suppose P is false. Then from Premise 3, N → P is false. So if N is true, then P must be true. So N → P is false only when N is true and P is false.

But if P is false, then from Premise 2, P → (N → ~O) is also false, because P is false. So that condition is automatically satisfied.

Wait, but if P is false, then from Premise 1, (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q) must be true. So if (N → ~O) is true, then O ∨ Q must be true. But if P is false, and from Premise 3, N → P is false, so N must be true (because if N is false, then N → P would be true regardless of P's value). So if N is true, then P is false (since N → P is false only when N is true and P is false). So N is true, P is false.

In this case, from Premise 1, (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q) must be true. But N is true, so N → ~O is true (because N is true and ~O is true). So O ∨ Q must be true. But if O is true, then O ∨ Q is true regardless of Q. If O is false, then Q must be true.

But if P is false, and N is true, then what about Q? We don't have any premise that directly affects Q, except through O.

Wait, but if P is false, and N is true, then from Premise 3, N → P is false. So that's fine. Now, from Premise 1, since (N → ~O) is true, O ∨ Q must be true. But if O is false, then Q must be true. So in this scenario, Q is true.

But does this help us derive O ∨ P? Well, if O is false, then P is false, so O ∨ P would be false. So in this case, O ∨ P would be false. But wait, can we have a scenario where O ∨ P is false?

Yes. Because if O is false and P is false, then O ∨ P is false. So O ∨ P is not a necessary consequence of the premises. So D is not a consequence.

Wait, but in that case, D is not an immediate consequence.

Option E: ~N.

Can we derive ~N?

Hmm, from Premise 3, N → P. So if N is true, then P is true. But if N is false, we don't get any information. So can we derive that N must be false?

I don't think so. Because the premises don't allow us to conclude that N is false unless we have some way to derive it.

So for example, if N is true, then P is true (from Premise 3). But if N is false, then we don't know anything about P. So E is not a consequence.

Option F: P.

From Premise 2, P → (N → ~O). So if P is true, then N → ~O is true. But we can't conclude P is necessarily true. For example, if N is false, then N → ~O is true regardless of P. So if N is false, P could be true or false. So P doesn't have to be always true; it's possible for it to be false.

Wait, but if N is false, then from Premise 3, N → P is vacuously true (since N is false), so P can be either true or false. So P doesn't have to be necessarily true. So F is not a consequence.

Option G: N → ~O.

Well, from Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). But we can't derive N → ~O directly. Because if N is true, then (N → ~O) is true only if O is false. But from Premise 2, when P is true (which can happen even if N is true), then N → ~O must be true. So when N is true, (N → ~O) is true, leading to O ∨ Q. But if O is false, then Q is needed. But we don't have information about Q in this scenario. So N → ~O is not necessarily a consequence.

Option H: P → Q.

Hmm, can we derive P → Q? Let's see.

From Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q).

If (N → ~O) is true, then O ∨ Q is true. But we don't know if O is true or false. If O is false, then Q must be true. But if O is true, then Q could be either way. So from N → ~O → O ∨ Q, but Q can be true or false. So we can't derive P → Q.

Alternatively, perhaps not. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps using hypothetical syllogism: If (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q) and (N → ~O) is true, then O ∨ Q is true.

But we can't directly get P → Q from that.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me see.

If I can derive P → Q, then H would be correct. But I'm not sure how to get there.

Alternatively, let's think about what each option represents.

Option C is N → Q. We've established that's a consequence.

Option E: ~N. We don't have evidence for that.

Option A: P → O. We don't think that's a consequence.

Option D: O ∨ P. We don't think that's a consequence because O ∨ P could be false if both are false.

Option B: O ∨ Q. That is already a consequence of Premise 1.

Option F: P. We don't think that's a consequence.

Option G: N → ~O. From N → P and P → (N → ~O), but when N is true, P is true, and then N → ~O is true, leading to O being false. So when N is true, O is false, and thus N → ~O is true. So in that case, N → ~O holds. But if N is false, then N → ~O is vacuously true. So N → ~O is actually a consequence of the premises. Because if N is true, then N → ~O is true, leading to O being false. So N → ~O is a consequence.

Wait, so if N → ~O is a consequence, then option G is correct. But earlier, I thought that N → Q is also a consequence.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

From the premises, can I derive N → Q?

Yes, because when N is true, from Premise 3, P is true (since N → P). From Premise 2, since P is true, N → ~O is true, which leads to O being false. Therefore, when O is false, O ∨ Q is true, which requires Q to be true. So N → Q is a necessary consequence.

Wait, but then option C is correct. But earlier, I thought that N → ~O is a consequence. So which one is correct?

Wait, let's see. From Premise 3, N → P.

From Premise 2, P → (N → ~O).

So combining, N → (P → (N → ~O)).

Using hypothetical syllogism, since N → P and P → (N → ~O), we can get N → (N → ~O).

Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's consider that when N is true, from Premise 3, P is true. From Premise 2, P → (N → ~O) is true, which is consistent.

But then, when N is true and P is true, N → ~O is true, so O is false. So in that case, O is false, so O ∨ Q is Q, so Q must be true.

Therefore, N → Q is a consequence.

So, if we can derive N → Q, then option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake, and N → ~O is not a consequence.

Wait, let's think again.

If N is true, then from Premise 3, P is true.

From Premise 2, since P is true, N → ~O must be true. So N is true, so ~O is true, so O is false.

So when N is true, O is false, so O ∨ Q is Q, so Q must be true.

Therefore, N → Q is a consequence.

So, option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option G (N → ~O) is also correct, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, let me see if N → ~O is a consequence.

If N is true, then from Premise 3, P is true.

From Premise 2, since P is true, N → ~O must be true. So when N is true, ~O is true, so O is false.

Therefore, when N is true, O is false, so O ∨ Q is Q, so Q must be true.

So N → Q holds, but does N → ~O hold?

Wait, because when N is true, from Premise 3, P is true. Then, from Premise 2, P → (N → ~O) is true, but that doesn't necessarily mean that N → ~O is true. It's possible that N → ~O is false, but P → (N → ~O) is true.

Wait, but in this case, N is true, so if N → ~O were false, then ~O would be false, which would make O true. But from N → P (since N is true), and P → (N → ~O), which is true, but N → ~O could be false if N is true and ~O is false, which would make O true.

Wait, but in this scenario, if N is true and ~O is false, then O is true. But the premises don't directly give us any condition on O when N is true.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to derive N → Q.

From N → P and P → (N → ~O), we can get N → (P → (N → ~O)).

Using hypothetical syllogism: since N → P and P → (N → ~O), then N → (N → ~O).

But N → (N → ~O) is just a restatement of N → ~O. So that doesn't help us.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that P → (N → ~O) is equivalent to P → (N → ~O). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's see if O ∨ Q is a consequence.

From Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)

If (N → ~O) is true, then O ∨ Q is true. But O ∨ Q is already given.

Wait, perhaps I'm not making progress. Let me try to approach this differently.

Using the premises, let's see what we can derive.

From Premise 2: P → (N → ~O)

From Premise 3: N → P

So, P → (N → ~O) is the same as (P → (N → ~O)).

But we can combine this with N → P.

So, P → (N → ~O) → (N → ~O)

Wait, perhaps using hypothetical syllogism again: if P → (N → ~O) and N → P, then P → (N → ~O) is equivalent to (N → ~O) → (P → (N → ~O)).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to find a way to derive N → Q.

If I can derive N → Q, then option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can derive N → P, P → (N → ~O), and N → Q, and see if that's consistent.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Perhaps it's better to accept that option C is correct, as N → Q is a consequence.
</think>

The correct immediate consequence is **C: N → Q**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Premise 1**: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)
2. **Premise 2**: P → (N → ~O)
3. **Premise 3**: N → P

**Deriving N → Q:**

- From Premise 3 (N → P), if N is true, P is true.
- From Premise 2 (P → (N → ~O)), if P is true, then N → ~O is true.
  - If N is true, then ~O is true (since N → ~O).
  - Therefore, O is false.
- From Premise 1 ((N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)), if (N → ~O) is true (i.e., O is false), then (O ∨ Q) is true regardless of Q.
- Hence, when N is true, O is false, and Q must be true for (O ∨ Q) to hold.
- Therefore, N → Q is a necessary consequence.

**Other Options Evaluated:**

- **A: P → O** → False. If P is true, O is false.
- **B: O ∨ Q** → Already a consequence from Premise 1.
- **C: N → Q** → Correct consequence.
- **D: O ∨ P** → False, as O is false and P can be true or false.
- **E: ~N** → False, as N can be true or false.
- **F: P** → False, as P can be true or false.
- **G: N → ~O** → True if N is true, O is false. But not necessarily a consequence.
- **H: P → Q** → False. If P is true, Q can be true or false.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: N → Q**.
