Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about ideal solutions. Let me think through what I remember about this.

The question is asking what defines an ideal solution. I remember that in chemistry, solutions can be classified into different types based on their properties. One of them is an ideal solution, which I think is a homogeneous mixture where the solute and solvent can mix without any changes in the physical properties of the mixture. 

Wait, the options are A to I. Let me go through each one.

Option A says it's a mixture where solvents can't be dissolved in any ratio. No, that doesn't sound right. I think ideal solutions are more about the solute-solvent interactions than just whether solvents can mix. Also, it's a homogeneous mixture, so that's not the case.

Option B: Reacts violently. That can't be right because ideal solutions are stable. They don't react chemically, so B is out.

Option C: Solvents repel each other. That's probably something else, maybe like in the case of non-ideal solutions where solutes affect the solvent. Ideal solutions have solvents that mix without repelling. So C doesn't seem correct.

Option D: Potential energy same as individual solvents. Wait, ideal solutions have lower potential energy than the sum of the individual solvents. So if the solution has the same potential energy as the solvents combined, that's not ideal. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Changes color when combined. That's about physical properties, like color change. Ideal solutions are colorless, so E is not correct.

Option F: Decreases potential energy. I think this is about non-ideal solutions. When solutes interact with each other, the potential energy decreases. So F is not ideal.

Option G: Increases potential energy. Again, this would be non-ideal because if the solute-solvent interactions are stronger, the potential energy increases. So G is not correct.

Option H: Mixture that is colorless. Colorless refers to the solution, not the type of solution. For example, water and alcohol are colorless solutions, but that's about the solution's color, not the solution's type. So H might be a property, not the definition.

Option I: Same physical properties as individual solvents. Oh, wait, I remember that ideal solutions have the same physical properties as the pure solvents. Like density, melting point, boiling point, etc. So that makes sense.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is **I: a mixture where the potential energy of the mixture is the same as that of the individual solvents**. 

**Explanation:**
- **Option A** is incorrect because ideal solutions are homogeneous, not heterogeneous.
- **Option B** is incorrect because ideal solutions are stable and do not react chemically.
- **Option C** is incorrect because ideal solutions allow solvents to mix without repelling.
- **Option D** is incorrect because ideal solutions have lower potential energy than the sum of individual solvents.
- **Option E** is incorrect because physical properties like color are not the focus of ideal solutions.
- **Option F** is incorrect because it describes non-ideal solutions, not ideal ones.
- **Option G** is incorrect because it describes non-ideal solutions.
- **Option H** is incorrect because it refers to color, not the type of solution.
- **Option I** is correct because ideal solutions have the same physical properties as the pure solvents.
