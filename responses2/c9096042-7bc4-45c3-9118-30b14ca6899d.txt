Okay, so I need to find the duty cycle for a step-up chopper. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. I remember that a step-up chopper uses a DC input to produce a higher voltage. Oh wait, right, the way it works is that the chopping action changes the output voltage based on the duty cycle.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, the duty cycle 'D' is the ratio of the time the switch is on to the total time. For a step-up chopper, the maximum output voltage is when the switch is on. The formula I think is Vout = Vin * (1/D). Oh wait, no, wait: the formula is Vout = V_in * (1/(1-D)) when it's a step-up. Or wait, maybe I got it backwards.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The duty cycle is D = (Ton)/(ToT) where Ton is the on time and ToT is the total period. So, when the switch is on for a fraction D of the time, the output voltage is higher.

Wait, the output voltage for a step-up chopper is Vout = V_in * (Vout / V_in) = V_in * (1/(1-D)). Because when D is high, it's on for a long time, so Vout is high.

Wait, no, that's not right. The formula for a step-up chopper is Vout = V_in * (1/(D)). Because if D is 0.5, for example, but wait, no, wait when D is 0.5, the output voltage is 2*V_in. Because when D is 0.5, the voltage is 1/(0.5) = 2 V_in.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the formula is V_out = V_in * (1/D). So, to find D, we rearrange that: D = V_in / V_out.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, the input is 110 V and output is 150 V. So V_in is 110, V_out is 150. So D would be 110/150. Let me calculate that. 110 divided by 150 is 0.7333... So, about 0.733 or 73.3%. Looking at the options, E is 0.75, which is close. But wait, maybe the formula is different?

Wait, another thought: maybe I got the formula wrong. If the chopper is a step-down, then the formula is slightly different. Oh wait, no: step-up is when the current is inductance so the voltage is higher than the input. So the formula for output voltage is Vout = V_in * (1/D) only when the output is higher than the input. Wait, but wait, the formula is Vout = V_in * (V_out / V_in) when the chopper is a step-up. So yes, V_out / V_in = 1/D â†’ D = V_in / V_out.

So, 110 / 150 = 0.7333. So the duty cycle is about 0.733. Looking at the options, option E is 0.75, which is the closest. So I think E is the correct answer.

To determine the duty cycle of a step-up chopper, we use the formula:

\[
D = \frac{V_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{out}}}
\]

where \( V_{\text{in}} \) is the input voltage and \( V_{\text{out}} \) is the output voltage. Substituting the given values:

\[
D = \frac{110}{150} = 0.733
\]

The duty cycle is approximately 0.733. Among the provided options, the closest value is 0.75 (option E). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: 0.75**
