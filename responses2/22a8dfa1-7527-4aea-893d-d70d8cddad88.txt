Okay, so I've got this question about meteorites and what they reveal about the solar system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

I remember that meteorites are fragments of meteoroids, right? They were thought to be remnants of planets that have decayed over time. So, I'm trying to recall what these meteorites tell us about the solar system's history.

Looking at the options, all of them are different statements. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Option A: They reveal the solar system was once part of a larger galaxy. Wait, I don't think meteorites are connected to a larger galaxy. I think meteorites are from smaller bodies, like asteroids, which are part of the solar system. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: They reveal all planets had life. No, meteorites are from planets, but not necessarily the ones that had life. Some are from Earth-like planets, but the question is about the solar system as a whole. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: They show the solar system is about 4.6 billion years old. Wait, the age of the solar system is different from meteorites. The solar system's age is estimated to be around 4.58 billion years, as per some studies. But meteorites are younger. I thought meteorites are remnants of the early solar system, which would be millions to billions of years old. So C might not be accurate. Or is it that meteorites are from the early Earth, meaning the solar system is older than that?

Hmm, I think the solar system is about 4.58 billion years old, but meteorites were formed much earlier. So maybe the correct age is much younger than the solar system's age. So option C might be wrong.

Option D: They show the solar system has 10 planets. No, meteorites don't provide information about the number of planets in the solar system. It's more about the identity of those planets. So D is incorrect.

Option E: They show meteorites are remnants of a fifth planet. Yes, that rings a bell. I remember that meteorites are thought to come from the early Earth, which was part of a larger solar system. So E sounds correct.

Option F: They show the solar system had 10 planets. No, I don't think that's what meteorites tell us. They don't inform us about the number of planets; they tell about the origin. So F is wrong.

Option G: They reveal meteorites are older than comets and planets. Wait, I think comets are older. Like, comets are thought to be billions of years old, while planets are a few hundred million years. So G is incorrect because meteorites are older than comets.

Option H: Suggests the solar system is much younger. No, because meteorites are thought to be from the early solar system, which is much older than the current solar system. So H is wrong.

Option I: They show early solar system was mostly hydrogen and helium. Yes, that's correct. Because early planets formed from these gases. So I's correct.

Wait, the question says "what do meteorites reveal about the solar system?" So both E and I seem correct. But wait, how many options are correct? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question is which one is correct.

Wait, I thought meteorites are from the early Earth, which was part of a solar system that is much older than the current one. So meteorites are older than the current solar system. So the solar system is younger than the meteorites. So meteorites are older. So I's statement is correct.

But in the options, E says they're remnants of a fifth terrestrial planet. I think E is correct.

Wait, so options E and I both seem correct. But I can only select one. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the question is asking which one is the correct statement. So the options are A to J.

Wait, I've gone through each option. Let's see:

Option E is correct because meteorites come from a fifth planet, which is what the fifth planet is commonly referred to as.

Option I says the early solar system was mostly H and He. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the options are separate, so only one is correct. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, looking at the options again. So the question is about what meteorites reveal. So both E and I seem correct. But perhaps I'm mixing up.

Wait, option I says that the early solar system consisted of mostly hydrogen and helium gas. I think that's correct because early planets formed from these gases.

But the question asks which statement is correct. So either E or I.

Wait, the options are labeled A-J. Let me recheck the options.

The question is: What do meteorites reveal about the solar system?

So the correct answers are E and I, but since we have to choose one, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check the options again.

Option I: They reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas. So yes, this is correct.

Option E: They reveal that meteorites are remnants of a fifth terrestrial planet. Yes, that's correct as well.

Wait, but each option is a separate statement. So perhaps the question is which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I, but I might have confused with E.

Wait, the options are A to J, each an independent statement. So the question is about which statement is correct.

Looking back, the options are:

E: They reveal that meteorites are remnants of a fifth terrestrial planet.

I: They reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium gas.

So both are correct. But the options are labeled as separate answers, so perhaps the correct answer is E and I, but the options are each single choices.

Wait, perhaps I'm incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, no. I think the question is which one is correct. So perhaps E and I are both correct, but the options are single choice. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, no, the options are each a statement, and I have to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is I, because meteorites are remnants of a fifth planet, which is the fifth planet. But wait, the fifth planet is Earth, which is part of the solar system. But that's about the origin, not the age.

Wait, the age of the solar system is about 4.58 billion years. meteorites, being from the early Earth, would be much older than the solar system. So option G says they're older than comets and planets. Comets are older, so G is incorrect.

So for meteorites, the correct statements would be about their origin, not about the age.

Wait, looking back:

Option E is correct, as meteorites are remnants of a fifth planet (like Earth), which was part of the solar system.

Option I says the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium, which is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So both E and I are correct statements. But the options are labeled as separate options, so which one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Solar system once part of larger galaxy.

B: All planets had life.

C: Solar system is ~4.6 billion years old.

D: Solar system has 10 planets.

E: Meteorites are remnants of a fifth planet.

F: Solar system had 10 planets.

G: Meteorites older than comets and planets.

H: Solar system much younger.

I: Early solar system had mostly H and He.

J: Solar system is much younger.

So the question is which statement is correct.

So both E and I are correct statements.

But in the options, each is an independent statement. So perhaps the question is which one is correct.

Wait, looking back, perhaps E is correct, and I is correct. But the options are labeled as separate letters. So possibly, the correct answer is I.

Wait, but the question says "what do meteorites reveal about the solar system?" So both E and I are correct. But that's not possible, as the options are single-select.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me look at other options.

I think option I is correct because it's about the composition of the early solar system. But E is about the origin.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E and I are both correct, but in the options, only one can be selected. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, but the question is about the age of the solar system.

Wait, I thought the solar system is about 4.58 billion years old, but meteorites are thought to be from the early Earth, which is a few billion years old. So the solar system is much older than the meteorites. So the correct age is much younger than the meteorites. So option G says meteorites are older than comets and planets, which is incorrect. So G is wrong.

So the correct statements are E and I. But the options are single-select. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about the age. Maybe the age of the solar system is about 4.6 billion years, and meteorites are from a fifth planet. So I is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So E and I are both correct statements. But the options are A to J, each an independent statement. So perhaps I should pick I as the correct answer, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the question asks what do meteorites reveal about the solar system. So the correct answer is the option that describes a meteorite's origin.

E is about the origin, so it's correct.

I is about the composition of the early solar system. So both E and I are correct. But in the options, each is a separate answer. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check all the options again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The options are:

E: The fifth planet is the source of meteorites. So correct.

I: The early solar system was mostly H and He. Correct.

So both E and I are correct. But the options are single-select, so perhaps only one is correct. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because meteorites are remnants of a fifth planet, which is Earth-like.

Wait, but that's the origin. E is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The question is asking which statement is correct. So both E and I are correct.

But the options are labeled A to J, each a separate statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what meteorites are.

Metorites are from the early Earth, which is part of the solar system. So they are remnants of the early solar system. So E is correct.

I think the correct statements are E and I. But the options are single-select, so perhaps I should pick E.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me try to think if any other options are correct.

Option D: solar system has 10 planets. No, because meteorites don't inform about the number of planets, only their origin. So D is incorrect.

Wait, option A: the solar system once part of a larger galaxy. No, meteorites are from the solar system, not a galaxy. So A is incorrect.

Option B: all planets had life. No, they are from Earth-like bodies.

Option C: solar system age is ~4.6 billion. No, I thought solar system is about 4.58, and meteorites are believed to be older.

So, option C is incorrect.

Option F: solar system had 10 planets. No, meteorites don't say anything about that.

Option G: older than comets and planets. No, comets are older.

Option H: solar system much younger. No, because meteorites are older.

Option J: solar system much younger. No, same as H.

So only E and I are correct. But perhaps the options are each a separate answer, and only one is correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E and I. But the options are labeled A to J, so the correct answer is the one that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to pick the correct answer based on meteorites' composition. So I is correct.

But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recall: meteorites are from Earth, which is a part of the solar system. So they are remnants of the solar system, implying the solar system is older than the meteorites. So meteorites are older than the solar system. So option G is incorrect.

So among the options, E and I are correct.

But the options are single-select.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both E and I are correct. But the options are single-select. So perhaps the correct answer is I, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, and E is a correct statement.

Wait, perhaps I should select option I because meteorites are remnants of a fifth planet, which is the fifth planet. But that's about the origin.

Wait, perhaps the question is which statement is correct. So both E and I are correct. But the options are single-select, so perhaps I'm supposed to pick I.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is I.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think I should go with the answer that meteorites reveal that the early solar system consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium. So option I is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because E and I are both correct.

The question asks which statement correctly describes what meteorites reveal about the solar system. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Meteorites are fragments from the solar system, not part of a larger galaxy.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Meteorites do not reveal information about all planets having life; they originate from Earth-like planets.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The solar system is estimated to be about 4.58 billion years old, while meteorites are believed to be older.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Meteorites do not inform us about the number of planets in the solar system; they are about the origin of planets.
- **Option E**: Correct. Meteorites are remnants of the fifth planet, Earth, which was part of the solar system.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Meteorites do not indicate that the solar system once contained 10 planets.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Comets are older than meteorites, not older than meteorites.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The solar system is much older than the meteorites.
- **Option I**: Correct. Meteorites are thought to originate from the early solar system, which was dominated by hydrogen and helium.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The solar system is not much younger; meteorites are believed to be older.

Both **Option E** and **Option I** are correct statements. However, since the question requires a single answer and both E and I describe different aspects of meteorites, the best choice is **Option I**, as it directly addresses the composition of the early solar system.
