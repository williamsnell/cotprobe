Question:

A canning company bought a $15,000 piece of machinery for its vegetable farm. The machinery is expected to last six years at which time it will have no residual value. The company wishes to use the maximum percentage allowable under the declining-balance method for computing the depreciation. Find the depreciation and book value for the first three years of operation.

Options:

A: Year 1: $4,500, Year 2: $2,700, Year 3: $1,620
B: Year 1: $5,000, Year 2: $3,333, Year 3: $2,222
C: Year 1: $6,000, Year 2: $3,600, Year 3: $2,160
D: Year 1: $2,500, Year 2: $1,667, Year 3: $1,111
E: Year 1: $2,000, Year 2: $1,200, Year 3: $720
F: Year 1: $3,750, Year 2: $2,250, Year 3: $1,350
G: Year 1: $7,500, Year 2: $5,000, Year 3: $2,500
H: Year 1: $3,333, Year 2: $2,222, Year 3: $1,481
I: Year 1: $3,000, Year 2: $2,000, Year 3: $1,000
J: Year 1: $4,000, Year 2: $2,400, Year 3: $1,440

Okay, so I've got this problem about depreciation for a canning company. The machinery cost $15,000 and is expected to last six years with no residual value. They want to use the maximum percentage allowable under the declining-balance method. I need to figure out the depreciation for the first three years and see which option matches.

Hmm, I remember that the declining balance method uses a fixed rate each year to calculate depreciation. The formula is usually something like ( declining rate ) multiplied by the book value. But wait, what's the maximum percentage allowed? I think the U.S. GAAP allows for a certain percentage, usually 200% of the straight-line rate. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The straight-line rate is 1/6 per year, which is about 16.67%. So the maximum allowed rate under declining balance is 200% of that, which would be 33.33% per year. Oh wait no, wait. Wait, the declining balance method can use any rate as long as it's more than double the straight-line rate. Wait no, no, I think that actually, the maximum rate is 200% of the straight-line rate, which in this case would be 33.333%. Let me confirm.

Wait, no. Wait, the straight-line rate is 1/6, which is about 16.6667% per year. So for the declining balance method, the maximum allowed rate is 200% of the straight-line rate, which is 33.333% per year. So that would be 33.333% each year.

Wait, but sometimes the maximum allowed rate is 200% of the straight-line, but I think that's for the declining balance method, which is for assets. So, yes, the maximum rate would be 200% of the straight-line rate. So 16.6667% * 2 = 33.333% per year.

So, the depreciation each year would be the book value multiplied by 33.333%. The book value decreases each year as depreciation is taken each year.

Let me calculate year by year.

Year 1:
Depreciable amount = $15,000 * (33.333%) = $15,000 * (1/3) = $5,000.

So depreciation in Year 1 is $5,000. Then the book value after Year 1 is $15,000 - $5,000 = $10,000.

Year 2:
Depreciation rate is still 33.333%, so $10,000 * 33.333% = $3,333.33.

Book value after Year 2 is $10,000 - $3,333.33 = $6,666.67.

Year 3:
Depreciation is $6,666.67 * 33.333% = $2,222.22.

So the depreciation for the first three years is $5,000, $3,333, and $2,222 respectively.

Looking at the options, option B is Year 1: $5,000, Year 2: $3,333, Year 3: $2,222. So that matches.

The problem involves calculating depreciation using the maximum allowed rate under the declining balance method for a $15,000 machinery with a 6-year life and no residual value. The maximum rate is 200% of the straight-line rate, which is 1/6 or approximately 16.6667%, leading to a rate of 33.333% per year.

**Year 1:**
- Depreciation = $15,000 * 33.333% = $5,000
- Book value = $15,000 - $5,000 = $10,000

**Year 2:**
- Depreciation = $10,000 * 33.333% = $3,333.33
- Book value = $10,000 - $3,333.33 = $6,666.67

**Year 3:**
- Depreciation = $6,666.67 * 33.333% ≈ $2,222.22
- Book value = $6,666.67 - $2,222.22 ≈ $4,444.45

The depreciation amounts for the first three years are $5,000, $3,333, and $2,222, respectively. Comparing with the options, option B matches these values.

**ANSWER: B**
