Okay, so I've got this economics question here about price elasticity of demand. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a business wants to increase revenue and knows that the demand price elasticity is 0.78. They're asking what the business should do. The options are various combinations of increasing or decreasing the price based on elasticity.

First, I remember that price elasticity of demand (PED) measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. But the exact formula isn't crucial here; more important is understanding the implications of different elasticity values.

So, the elasticity here is 0.78. That's less than 1. I think when PED is between 0 and 1, the demand is inelastic. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. No, wait, wait—wait a second. Wait, no: when PED is less than 1, demand is inelastic. Because inelastic means that the quantity demanded doesn't change much when price changes. So if PED is 0.78, that's inelastic.

Wait, but there's a thing about the direction of price change and revenue. Revenue is affected by both price and quantity. So when elasticity is inelastic, if you increase price, quantity demanded decreases, but the percentage decrease is smaller than the percentage increase in price. So overall revenue should increase.

Wait, but wait: I'm a little confused. Let me think about it again. Let's say original price is P, quantity Q. If elasticity is inelastic (|E|<1), then when you increase P by a certain percentage, the quantity demanded decreases by a smaller percentage. So the total revenue (P*Q) would increase because the decrease in Q is less than the increase in P.

But what if elasticity is elastic (|E|>1)? Then a price increase would lead to a larger decrease in quantity, so revenue would decrease. Similarly, if you decrease price, the quantity increases by a larger percentage, so revenue would increase.

In this question, elasticity is 0.78, which is inelastic. So if the business wants to increase revenue, it should increase the price because the inelastic demand implies that the percentage loss in quantity is less than the percentage gain in price. So total revenue increases.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says increase price because inelastic.

Option D says decrease price because inelastic.

Wait, why? Because if demand is inelastic, lowering the price would increase quantity, but since the percentage change in quantity is bigger than the price change, revenue increases. However, the question is about what the business should do if it wants to increase revenue. So in this case, if the current price is such that increasing it would lead to higher revenue, then it should do that.

So the business should increase price because demand is inelastic. So the correct option would be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: if price elasticity is inelastic (E < 1), then raising the price will increase total revenue. So yes, the correct action is to increase price.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: increase price because inelastic.

Option D: decrease price because inelastic.

Wait, why would option D be an option? Because if the price elasticity were elastic, then lowering the price would increase revenue. But in this case, the elasticity is 0.78, so inelastic. So the correct choice is B.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "it should [...] increase revenue" — so the business should choose an action that leads to that.

So if the business is facing inelastic demand, then increasing price is the way to go because it boosts revenue. So the correct choice is option B.

The question asks whether a business should increase or decrease its price given that the demand price elasticity is 0.78 (which is inelastic). Price elasticity of demand measures responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes. When elasticity is less than 1, demand is inelastic, meaning a percentage increase in price leads to a smaller percentage decrease in quantity demanded, resulting in an increase in total revenue.

Given that the business wants to increase revenue, it should increase the price because the inelasticity implies that the revenue will rise when the price is raised.

The correct answer is:

**B: increase price because demand is inelastic**

Answer: B
