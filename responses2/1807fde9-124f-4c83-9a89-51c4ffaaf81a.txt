Question:

On March 1, a homeowner and a painter entered into a written contract wherein the painter promised to paint the exterior of the homeowner's house for $3,000. Prior to the signing of the contract, the homeowner and the painter orally agreed that their contract would be null and void unless the homeowner was able to obtain a $3,000 loan from National Bank before April 1. On March 31, the homeowner was informed by National Bank that his loan application had been rejected. The next day, the homeowner telephoned the painter and informed him that the deal was off. If the painter brings an action for breach of contract against the homeowner, would the latter's inability to secure the loan provide him with a valid defense?

Options:

A: No, because the homeowner is estopped to deny the validity of the written contract.
B: Yes, because the homeowner was not able to meet the financial obligations of the contract.
C: No, because the painter can claim damages for the breach of contract.
D: No, because the homeowner did not make efforts to secure a loan from another bank.
E: No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.
F: Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.
G: No, because the oral agreement about the loan does not hold legal validity.
H: Yes, because the painter was informed about the condition of the loan before the contract was signed.
I: Yes, because the agreement regarding the loan constituted a valid modification of the writing.

Okay, let's try to figure out this contract question. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to take it step by step.

So, the scenario is that a homeowner and a painter signed a written contract on March 1, promising the painter to paint the house for $3,000. Before signing, they orally agreed that the contract would be void unless the homeowner gets a $3k loan from National Bank by April 1. So, the contract depends on the homeowner obtaining that loan.

On March 31, the homeowner gets a rejection from National Bank. The next day, he calls the painter and says the deal is off. The painter is suing for breach of contract. The question is, does the homeowner's inability to get the loan provide a valid defense?

Hmm. Let me break it down. So, the contract is written, but there's an oral agreement that it's subject to a loan condition. That might be a key point here.

In contract law, contracts can be subject to conditions. If there's an oral agreement that the contract depends on another party's actions, does that make the written contract valid? I think the written contract might still stand unless the contract itself is affected by the oral condition.

Wait, when you have a written contract, it's subject to its terms. But if the terms are conditioned on another party's actions (like getting a loan), then the written contract might be deemed invalid if those actions can't be reasonably performed. But if the contract is valid under written terms, and the principals (homeowner and painter) are unable to perform, does that affect the contract?

I remember something about express conditions in contracts. If a contract has an express condition, like "subject to the terms of this agreement," that can make it invalid if the condition can't be reasonably met. But in this case, the condition is "unless the homeowners can secure a loan." So, it's not an express condition that makes the contract invalid, but an implied condition that depends on the homeowners' ability to get the loan.

Wait, but the contract is written. The written contract assumes that the principals can perform. If the principals can't perform, does that make the contract invalid? Or does the written contract's terms still hold, but the principals' inability to perform mean they can't fulfill the contract, leading to breach.

Wait, no. The written contract is a contract. If the principals cannot perform, then the contract is breached. But here, the contract was subject to a condition that the principals had to get a loan. So, the contract is only valid if the principals meet the condition. But the principals can't meet the condition because they couldn't get the loan.

But here, the principals called the painter and said the deal is off, meaning the contract was breached. So, perhaps the painter's defense is based on the principals' inability to meet the condition, hence the contract is invalid.

Wait, but the written contract was in principle valid. The contract depends on the principals meeting a condition. If the condition can't be met, the contract is invalid. So, the contract is invalid because the principals can't meet the condition. If the contract is invalid, then breach isn't a thing because the contract can't be performed. So, the painter's defense would be that the contract is invalid because the principals can't meet the condition, so they can't breach.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The contract depends on the principals meeting a condition. If the principals can't meet the condition, does that make the contract void? Or does the contract still exist, but the principals can't perform?

Wait, no. A contract that depends on the performance of another is not automatically invalid. It's that the contract is subject to that condition. So, the contract is valid in its terms, but the principals have to meet the condition. So, if they fail to do so, the contract is breached.

Wait, but in this case, the contract is a written contract, so the principals have the right to perform, unless the contract says otherwise. So, the written contract assumes that the principals can perform. But if the principals can't, then the contract is breached. But the contract's validity is still there because it's based on other principals' actions.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's approach it step by step.

The contract is written on March 1. It's clear that the painter promises to paint the house for $3k, which the homeowner can either pay or refuse. Before signing, the homeowners agreed that the contract would be null and void unless the homeowner can get a $3k loan from National Bank by April 1.

So, the written contract is subject to this condition. That means that the contract is only valid if the principals (homeowner and painter) can get the loan. If they can't, then the contract is void.

So, when the homeowners tried to get a loan, which they couldn't, the contract became void. So, the contract can't be performed because the condition wasn't met.

Now, the painter is suing. If the contract is void, then the painter's breach is moot because the contract doesn't exist anymore. But the question is, the homeowner's inability to get the loan provided a defense.

Wait, but the written contract is valid unless the principals can't meet the condition. So, the contract is still valid, but the principals must meet the condition. So, if the principals can't meet the condition, the contract isn't performed. But the contract's validity is still there.

So, the painter's defense would be that the written contract is still valid, but the principals can't perform because they couldn't get the loan. So, the contract is not breached because it can't be performed.

Wait, but the contract's validity is separate from the principals' performance. The contract's validity means it's a valid contract based on the principals' performance. But if the principals can't perform, then the contract is not performed. So, the contract's validity doesn't prevent the breach.

Alternatively, perhaps the written contract is valid, but it's subject to the condition. So, the contract is only valid if the principals can get the loan. So, the contract can't be performed because the principals failed. But that would imply that the contract is void.

So, the contract is invalid because the principals can't perform. Therefore, the painter's claim that the contract is void is valid, so the painter can sue for breach under the contract.

But the question is, does the homeowner's inability to get the loan provide a valid defense?

Wait, the defense would be that the contract is invalid because the principals couldn't perform. So, the painter could argue that the contract is void because the principals couldn't meet the condition, thus the contract is invalid, making the painter's claim a valid defense.

But the options are:

Option E says "No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing."

Wait, that's confusing. Let me read the options again.

Option E: No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.

Wait, so the agreement before signing varied the express terms. That is, the written contract had some terms, but the oral agreement changed them, but the written contract itself was still valid under its express terms.

Hmm. So, the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid as written, but can only be performed if the principals can get the loan. So, if the principals can't get the loan, the contract is void.

Wait, but in this case, the written contract's express terms are the same as before. So, the contract is valid, but the principals must meet the condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform because they can't get the loan.

Wait, but the written contract is still valid. So, the painter can sue for breach because the principals can't perform.

But the question is about whether the inability to get the loan provides a valid defense. That is, does the homeowner's failure to get the loan make the contract invalid, thus the painter can sue?

Wait, but the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform because they can't meet the condition. So, the contract is void.

Wait, no, the written contract is valid as long as the principals meet the condition. So, if the principals can't meet the condition, the contract is void, meaning it's not a valid contract. So, the contract can't be breached. But the contract's validity is separate from the principals' performance.

Wait, I think I'm getting more confused. Let me think about it differently.

The written contract is valid. It's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid because the principals can perform, but they can't. So, the contract is void. Therefore, the painter can't sue for breach because the contract can't be performed.

So, the defense would be that the contract is invalid because the principals failed to meet the condition, making the contract void.

But the options don't include that. Let's look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option E says 'No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.' So, in this scenario, the written contract's express terms are still valid, unless altered. So, the written contract's terms are consistent with the principals' ability to perform.

So, the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals must meet the condition. So, the contract is subject to the condition, but the principals can't meet it, making the contract void. But the contract's validity is separate.

Wait, but the contract's validity is based on the principals' performance. If they can't, the contract isn't performed. But the contract's terms are still valid, just the principals can't perform.

So, the contract is valid, but it's not performance. So, the painter's claim is that the contract is invalid because the principals couldn't perform, thus the contract can't be breached.

Wait, but the written contract is valid. So, the contract exists, just can't be performed. So, the contract is not void, but the breach is moot because the contract isn't performed.

Hmm. So, the defense would be that the contract is invalid because the principals couldn't perform. If the contract is invalid, then the painter can't sue for breach because the contract can't be performed.

But the options don't have that. Let's see the options again.

Looking at the options, option E is 'No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.' So, the principals' inability to get the loan is just a condition that's part of the written contract. So, even if the principals can't perform, the contract is still valid because the written terms are intact.

Wait, but the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals must meet the condition. So, the contract is valid as long as the principals meet the condition. If they don't, the contract is void.

Wait, but the contract is signed on March 1, and the principals try to get the loan on March 31. So, is the contract void because the principals can't perform? But the written contract is still valid, and the principals can perform, just not under this contract.

Alternatively, the written contract is valid, but it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but it's only valid if the principals can perform. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform. So, the painter's defense would be that the contract is void because the principals couldn't perform. Thus, the contract is not breached, so the painter can't sue for breach.

But the options don't have that. So, the options: option E says the agreement varied the express terms. So, the written contract's express terms are still valid. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform.

Wait, so the contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract's validity is not affected by the principals' decision to get the loan. The contract's validity is separate from the principals' performance.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about it this way: the written contract was valid, but it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals must meet the condition. So, the contract is not performed because the principals failed. Thus, the contract is void.

But if that's the case, then the contract is void, making the painter's defense that the contract is invalid. So, the painter can sue for breach.

But the question is, does the homeowner's failure to get the loan provide a valid defense? That is, does it make the contract invalid, thereby providing a defense.

Alternatively, the written contract is valid under its express terms, but the principals must meet the condition. So, the contract's validity is not affected by their ability to perform. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform, thus the contract is not breached.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition, so the contract is valid. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform, so the contract is void.

But the contract's validity is separate. So, the painter can sue for breach because the principals couldn't perform, making the contract void.

But why would the defense be that the principals couldn't perform? Because the contract's express terms require them to get the loan.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up express and implied conditions. The written contract's terms are that it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can perform only if they can get the loan. So, the contract is valid as written, but the principals must perform, which they can't. So, the contract is void.

But the painter would then argue that the contract is invalid because the principals couldn't perform, thus the contract can't be breached. So, the painter's defense is that the written contract is invalid because the principals couldn't perform.

Wait, but the contract's express terms are still valid. So, the written contract is valid, regardless of the principals' ability to perform. So, the contract is valid, but it's void because the principals can't meet the condition.

So, the contract is invalid, making the painter's claim of invalidity valid, thus the painter can sue for breach.

But the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Looking at the options, option E says 'No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.' Wait, that can't be right. The written contract's express terms are still valid.

Wait, perhaps the way I'm thinking is wrong. Let me think about it again.

The written contract is valid, but it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can only perform if they can get the loan. So, if the principals can't, the contract is void.

So, the contract is not valid because the principals can't perform, thus the painter's defense is that the contract is void.

Wait, but the contract's validity is separate from the principals' performance. So, the contract exists and is valid, but the principals can't perform, so the contract can't be breached, making the painter's claim invalid.

But the question is whether the homeowners' inability to get the loan (which is a failure to perform) provides a defense.

Wait, no, that's not the case. The painter's defense would be that the contract is void because the principals can't perform, making the contract invalid, thus the painter can't sue.

So, the defense is that the contract is invalid because the principals couldn't perform. So, the contract can't be breached, so the painter can't get a valid defense.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option E says 'No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.' But that's talking about the principals' condition, not the contract's express terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition, so the contract is still valid. Thus, the principals can perform only if they can get the loan.

So, the written contract's express terms are valid, but the principals can't perform, making the contract void.

So, the painter can't sue because the contract can't be breached. So, the defense is that the contract is void.

But the options don't have that. Let's see the options again.

Looking at the options, option E is 'No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.'

Wait, the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals must meet the condition. So, the contract is still valid, but the principals can't perform.

So, the contract's validity is not affected by the principals' ability to perform. So, the written contract is valid, but the principals can't perform, making the contract void.

In this case, the contract is invalid, and the painter can sue for breach.

But the options don't include that. The options are about whether the defense is valid.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because the written contract's express terms vary, meaning the contract is still valid, but the principals must perform. If the principals can't perform, the contract is void.

Wait, no, because the contract's validity is separate from the principals' performance.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.

The written contract is valid, but it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid as written, but can't be performed because the principals can't get the loan. So, the contract is void. Therefore, the painter can't sue for breach because the contract can't be performed.

But the question is, does the homeowners' inability to meet the loan condition provide a valid defense.

Wait, no. The defense is that the contract is invalid because the principals can't perform. So, the painter's defense is that the contract is invalid, making the painter's claim of breach ungrounded.

But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the written contract is still valid because the principals can perform, but the contract is subject to the loan condition, which would make the contract invalid if the principals can't meet the condition. So, the contract is void because the principals can't perform, making the painter's defense valid.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition, which is part of the contract's terms. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can only perform if they can get the loan. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform, making the contract void.

So, the defense is that the contract is void because the principals failed to meet the condition, making the contract invalid. So, the painter's defense is that the contract is invalid because the principals couldn't get the loan, thus the contract can't be breached.

Looking at the options, option E is 'No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.' Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the written contract's express terms are still valid. So, the contract is valid, but the principals must meet the condition. So, if the principals can't meet the condition, the contract is void. So, the painter can sue for breach because the contract is void.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again.

The written contract is valid. It's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform. So, the contract is still valid, but the principals can't perform. So, the contract isn't breached, so the painter's claim is invalid.

But the question is about the defense: does the homeowners' inability to get the loan provide a valid defense.

Wait, no. The homeowners are failing to get the loan, but the written contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform. So, the contract is still valid, and breach isn't possible.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the answer choices again.

The options are:

A: Yes, contract is valid, but principals can't perform.

B: Wait, I don't know.

C: No, express terms vary.

D: No, condition is varied.

E: No, because the agreement about the loan varied the express terms.

Wait, perhaps the written contract is valid, but the principals can only perform if they meet the loan condition. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform. So, the contract is still valid, but the principals can't perform. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform, making the contract void.

Wait, so the contract's express terms are that it's subject to the loan condition, making the contract valid. But the principals can't perform, making the contract void. So, the contract's validity is separate from the principals' performance.

Wait, but if the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform, the contract is void. So, the contract isn't a contract at all.

But the contract's validity is still there, so the painter can sue for breach.

Wait, but the painter's defense would be that the contract is invalid because the principals couldn't meet the condition, thus the contract can't be breached.

So, the answer would be E, 'No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.'

Wait, but I thought the contract's express terms are still valid because the principals can perform only if they meet the condition. So, the contract's express terms are valid, but the principals can't perform, making the contract void.

So, the contract's validity is separate from the principals' performance. So, the contract is valid, but the principals can't perform, making the contract void.

Thus, the painter's defense is that the contract is invalid because the principals couldn't perform, thus making the contract void, so the painter's claim is invalid.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct answer is E.

Wait, let's think of a scenario where the written contract is valid, but the principals can perform only if they meet the condition. So, if the principals can't meet the condition, the contract is void.

In this case, the contract is written on March 1, and the principals can't meet the condition because the loan couldn't be obtained by March 31.

So, the contract is valid as written, but the principals can't perform, making the contract void.

Therefore, the painter's claim is invalid, so the answer is E.

But I'm not sure because the written contract's express terms are still valid, but the principals can't perform, making the contract void.

Thus, the answer is E, 'No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.'
</think>

The written contract is valid, but the principals must meet the condition set by the loan agreement to perform. In this case, the principals failed to meet the condition by March 31, unable to obtain the $3,000 loan. Since the principals couldn't perform, the contract is void. Therefore, the painter's claim is invalid, and the answer is E.

ANSWER: E
