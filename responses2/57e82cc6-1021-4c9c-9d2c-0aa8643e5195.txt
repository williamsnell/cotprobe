Okay, so I have this question about the hyperfine value for the EPR spectrum of a fully deuterated benzene radical anion, C6D6•-. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on EPR, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that EPR stands for Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. It's a technique used to study paramagnetic species, which have unpaired electrons. Benzene radicals, especially the C6H5••- anion, are known to be paramagnetic. But when it's fully deuterated, like C6D6••-, the electronic environment changes because deuterium is heavier than hydrogen, so maybe the resonance frequencies change.

Wait, hyperfine splitting in EPR is related to the interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spin. The hyperfine splitting is determined by the scalar coupling between the electron and nuclear spins. The formula for hyperfine splitting is something like ν = (γ_e γ_n)/(2π), but wait, no, that's for the natural abundance in natural abundance cases. Oh, but this is for a deuterated solution.

I think in a fully deuterated solution, the hyperfine splitting might be different because the nuclear spins are different. The hyperfine splitting in EPR is usually in the range of milliTesla (mT) or sometimes grams per Tesla (G), but I'm not exactly sure of the exact values.

Wait, the hyperfine splitting in EPR can be influenced by the magnetic field strength and the spin-spin coupling constant. The formula is ν = (γ_e γ_n)/(2π) * (B/2), assuming the same field. But wait, in a fully deuterated solution, the nuclear spin is 1 (like a proton), so for D, since it's 2H, each D contributes a certain value. Wait, no, in the question, it's C6D6•-, so each carbon is C, and each deuterium is D, right?

Wait, the molecule is C6H6••- but fully deuterated would be C6D6••-. So each H is replaced by D.

Now, in such a molecule, each carbon has six protons, but here all are deuterium. Wait, maybe it's better to think about the electronic structure. Benzene radicals are paramagnetic, but when fully deuterated, perhaps the spin state changes.

Wait, wait—deuterium is heavier than hydrogen, so the effective magnetic moment might change. In EPR, the hyperfine splitting depends on the number of hyperfine couplings and the effective nuclear spin. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that in a fully deuterated solution, the hyperfine splitting is reduced because the nuclear spin is larger (since D has spin ½, same as H), wait no, same spin. Wait, but the hyperfine splitting in EPR is given by (γ_e γ_n)/(2π) times the Larmor frequency, which is (γ * B/2). So the formula is ν = (γ_e γ_n B)/(4π), where B is the magnetic field strength. 

Wait, the hyperfine splitting constant (Δ) is given by (γ_e γ_n B)/(2π), because the splitting is (γ_e γ_n B)/(2π) * (1/2), but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The natural hyperfine splitting in a sample is usually on the order of 0.5 mT·T, but that's in solution. Deuterated solutions have different values.

In a fully deuterated solution, the nuclear spin is the same as in a proton because D has the same spin quantum number. So in this case, the hyperfine splitting would be higher than in a solution with fewer deuteriums because the coupling is stronger.

Wait, actually, the hyperfine splitting in EPR is typically around 0.5 to 1 mT in a natural solution, but in deuterated solutions, the hyperfine splitting can be affected by the spin-spin coupling. But wait, the effective spin might be different. Wait, D has the same spin as H, so the coupling constant would be the same. So, the hyperfine splitting in a fully deuterated sample might be higher or lower?

Wait, wait. The hyperfine splitting is usually given by the formula ν = (γ_e γ_n)/(2π) * (B/2), where B is the magnetic field. So if the sample is fully deuterated, and the nuclear spin is the same as H (so each D contributes the same as H), then the hyperfine splitting should be the same as in a solution with fewer deuteriums. But wait, that can't be right because I remember that in some cases, deuterated isotopes can affect the hyperfine splitting.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing the concepts. The hyperfine splitting in solution is related to the distribution of nuclear spins. But in a fully deuterated solution, all spins are the same, so the hyperfine splitting might be the same as in a natural solution. Or perhaps it's different because the deuterium is heavier, leading to a different effective magnetic moment.

Alternatively, maybe the hyperfine splitting in EPR is much lower in deuterated solutions. For example, I've read that in some cases, the hyperfine splitting is reduced by a factor of about 10 in deuterium-rich solutions. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Wait, wait, another approach. The hyperfine splitting in EPR is given by the formula Δ = (γ_e γ_n) * B/(2), where B is the magnetic field. If the molecule is fully deuterated, but each spin is the same as in a regular solution, then the hyperfine splitting remains the same as in the natural case. But wait, I'm getting more confused because I'm not remembering the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is about 0.5 mT in a natural solution. In a fully deuterated solution, it's higher. Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, some are in millimTesla, some are grams per Tesla. Oh wait, mT is milliTesla, which is a unit of magnetic field. But the hyperfine splitting in EPR is a frequency (so in Hz or mHz) but the options are all in mT or G (gauss). Hmm, but maybe the question is referring to the magnetic field effect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about the hyperfine value, which is the splitting in the EPR spectrum. For benzene radicals, the natural EPR hyperfine splitting is around 0.5 mT. But when it's deuterated, I think the splitting increases because the nuclear spin is the same, but the effective magnetic moment is different. Or wait, no, because D has the same spin as H, so the coupling is the same.

Wait, but wait. Hyperfine splitting in EPR is given by Δ = (γ_e γ_n) * B/(2π) * (1/2), perhaps? Or maybe the formula is Δ = (γ_e γ_n) * B/(4π). I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is about the same as in a regular benzene radical, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is lower in deuterated solutions because of the heavier mass, making the nuclear spin larger, but wait, D has the same spin as H. So the coupling might be the same, leading to same splitting.

Wait, maybe another angle. The hyperfine splitting depends on the effective magnetic field experienced by the electron. In a fully deuterated solution, each proton is replaced by D, which has the same spin. Therefore, the effective magnetic environment is similar to the natural case, so the hyperfine splitting would be the same as in the natural case. 

But wait, wait, the hyperfine splitting in EPR is a frequency, which is given by (γ_e γ_n)/(2π) * B/2. So if all spins are the same, the splitting should remain the same. But what about the actual value?

I think I remember that in a fully deuterated solution, the hyperfine splitting is about 0.3 mT. Wait, or is it higher?

Wait, another approach: the hyperfine splitting in EPR is typically in the range of 1-2 mT in a deuterated sample. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps in a fully deuterated solution, the hyperfine splitting is lower because the magnetic field is weaker? Or because the nuclear spin is larger, which could change the splitting.

Alternatively, let me think about the possible values given. The options are:

A: 2.35 mT
B: 1.17 G (gigamTesla, way too big)
C: 0.117 mT
D: 0.235 G (twice B)
E:5.80 mT
F: 0.58 G
G: 3.75 G
H: 0.0235 G
I:37.5 mT
J:0.375 mT

Wait, the options vary in units and magnitude. The options are in milliTesla, grams per Tesla. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because Tesla is a unit of magnetic field, not a frequency. So maybe the question is mistyped, and it's actually about the magnetic field strength in tesla, but the EPR splitting is a frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the line splitting in the EPR spectrum.

Wait, no, the hyperfine splitting is a frequency. So perhaps the correct unit is mHz or GHz. But the options are in mT, G, which are units of magnetic field.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the effective magnetic field causing the splitting. Or maybe it's about the hyperfine splitting in terms of the effective magnetic field. So perhaps in a fully deuterated sample, the effective magnetic field is lower because the D's are heavier? No, because D has the same spin as H. So the effective magnetic field would be the same as the natural case?

Wait, but in a fully deuterated solution, the effective magnetic field would be the same as the natural case because D's don't change the magnetic environment. So the hyperfine splitting would be around the same as in a solution with a small proportion of deuterium.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: I've heard that in deuterated solutions, the hyperfine splitting is reduced. I think for instance, in some cases, the splitting is about 0.3 times lower in deuterated solutions. But I'm not certain.

Wait, wait. The natural hyperfine splitting for benzene radicals is around 0.5 mT. In a solution with a higher proton content, the splitting increases. But in a fully deuterated solution, perhaps the splitting is higher.

Wait, no. Deuterium is heavier, but the hyperfine splitting is determined by the ratio of the number of protons to deuterium. Oh wait, no, in a fully deuterated sample, each proton is replaced by deuterium. So the number of protons is zero, but the number of deuterium is six. Wait no, benzene has six H, so in C6D6, all are D. So number of protons is zero, but each H is replaced by D, so the effective field is the same as the natural case, meaning the hyperfine splitting should be similar.

But wait, that can't be. If the molecule is fully deuterated, the hyperfine splitting should be similar to the natural case, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in a fully deuterated solution, the magnetic moment is reduced because of the heavy isotopes, leading to a lower hyperfine splitting. But wait, D has the same spin as H, so the magnetic moment would be same, leading to the same splitting.

Wait, but how does the presence of heavy isotopes affect hyperfine splitting? In the case of H2, when you have deuterium, the hyperfine splitting is actually enhanced because of the larger effective moment. Wait, but in the case of EPR, the splitting is due to the nuclear spin and the electron spin. So in a solution with more deuterium, the nuclear spin is the same, so the splitting remains the same.

Hmm, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the natural case. The natural hyperfine splitting is about 0.5 mT. If the solution is fully deuterated, perhaps the splitting is the same, but sometimes I've heard that deuterated solutions have lower splitting because the effective magnetic moment is smaller. But that doesn't make sense because D is heavier than H, so same spin, same magnetic moment.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up EPR with other spin systems. Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is the same as in the natural case, which would be 0.5 mT. But looking at the options, 0.5 mT isn't one of them. The closest is option C: 0.117 mT and D:0.235 G (0.235 G is 235 mT, which is way too big). Oh wait, mG is milliGauss, which is a different unit. So perhaps the question is wrong, but I have to choose based on the data.

Wait, another thought: in some cases, the hyperfine splitting can be much lower in deuterated solutions because the effective magnetic field is lower. But in this case, since all are D, the effective field is the same as the natural case. So the splitting should be around 0.5 mT.

But looking at the options:

A: 2.35 mT

B: 1.17 G (1.17 G is 1,170 mT. Way too high.)

C: 0.117 mT

D: 0.235 G (235 mT)

E:5.80 mT

F: 0.58 G

G:3.75 G

H: 0.0235 G

I:37.5 mT

J:0.375 mT

Wait, none of the options is 0.5 mT. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the deuterated solution's magnetic field is lower, leading to a lower hyperfine splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength.

Wait, hyperfine splitting is (γ_e γ_n B)/(2π). So if B is lower, then the splitting is lower.

But in a fully deuterated solution, B would be the same as natural if the isotopes are in higher concentration. Or wait, no—wait, the presence of D adds more D spins in the solution. But in a fully deuterated solution, all H are replaced by D, so the number of protons is zero, but each H is replaced by D. So the electron spin is still split by the nuclear spin, but the effective magnetic moment is the same as in the natural case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think about the typical hyperfine splitting in fully deuterated benzene radicals. I think that in a fully deuterated solution, the hyperfine splitting is lower. So perhaps the splitting is about 0.3 mT or similar.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.117 mT. Alternatively, option D is 0.235 G, which is 235 mT, which is too big. Option J is 0.375 mT. But that's a possible value. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: I think that in deuterated solutions, the hyperfine splitting is about 0.3 times lower than in the natural case. The natural splitting is 0.5 mT. So 0.5 * 0.3 = 0.15 mT, which is close to option C (0.117 mT) or option J (0.375 mT). So 0.15 is closer to 0.117 mT. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is about 0.3 times higher. 0.5 * 1.5 = 0.75 mT. But that's not an option.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the hyperfine splitting formula again.

The hyperfine splitting, Δ, is given by (γ_e γ_n B)/(2π), where γ_e is the electron gyromagnetic ratio, γ_n is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio.

In a fully deuterated solution, each proton is replaced by D, but since D has the same spin, the nuclear spin remains the same as in a pure H solution. So the splitting remains the same, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is the same as in the natural case, and the correct answer would be around 0.5 mT. But the closest option is C:0.117 mT or J:0.375 mT.

Wait, another thought: the hyperfine splitting in EPR can be calculated using the formula:

Δ = (γ_e γ_n B)/(2π)

For benzene's natural EPR, I think the splitting is about 0.5 mT. But in deuterated solutions, maybe it's lower because the effective magnetic field is the same, but due to the isotopes, the splitting is lower. So perhaps the hyperfine splitting is 0.3 * 0.5 mT = 0.15 mT. So the closest option would be 0.117 mT (option C).

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is 0.3 times the natural value. So 0.5 mT * 0.3 = 0.15 mT. So option C is 0.117 mT, which is close. Or maybe the splitting is higher.

Wait another angle: perhaps the presence of deuterium causes the hyperfine splitting to be lower. So, for example, if the natural splitting is 0.5 mT, the deuterated one is 0.5 mT * (1 - 0.3) = 0.35 mT. So then the closest option would be option J:0.375 mT. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting is lower than the natural case by a factor of about 10. So 0.5 mT /10 = 0.05 mT. But none of the options are 0.05 mT.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is 0.375 mT. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I've heard that in deuterated solutions, the hyperfine splitting is about 0.3 times lower. So if the natural splitting is 0.5 mT, the deuterated is 0.5 * 0.3 = 0.15 mT, which is closer to option C (0.117 mT) than to any others.

But I'm not sure. Without more knowledge, I'll have to make an educated guess. The options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

I think the correct answer is option C: 0.117 mT. Because if the natural splitting is 0.5 mT, and in deuterated solutions, it's 0.3 times lower, then 0.5 * 0.3 = 0.15 mT, which is close to option C (0.117 mT). Or perhaps the splitting is the same, but the options don't include that. So I'll choose option C.
</think>

The question asks for the hyperfine splitting value in the EPR spectrum of fully deuterated benzene radicals, such as C₆D₆•-•-. The hyperfine splitting is influenced by the magnetic field strength and the nuclear spin. In the natural case, benzene radicals have a hyperfine splitting of approximately 0.5 mT. However, in fully deuterated solutions, the presence of heavy isotopes (D) does not change the nuclear spin, so the hyperfine splitting remains the same as in the natural case. 

The provided options are:

- A: 2.35 mT  
- B: 1.17 G (equivalent to 1,170 mT)  
- C: 0.117 mT  
- D: 0.235 G (equivalent to 235 mT)  
- E: 5.80 mT  
- F: 0.58 G (equivalent to 580 mT)  
- G: 3.75 G (equivalent to 3,750 mT)  
- H: 0.0235 G (equivalent to 0.235 mT)  
- I: 37.5 mT  
- J: 0.375 mT  

None of the options directly match the expected value of 0.5 mT. However, based on the reasoning that the hyperfine splitting remains the same in fully deuterated solutions as in the natural case, the closest option is **C: 0.117 mT**. This assumes that the hyperfine splitting is reduced by a factor of 10 due to the presence of heavy isotopes, which is a reasonable assumption given the lack of further information.

ANSWER: C
