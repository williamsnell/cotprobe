Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out which expression is equal to the one used by Ms. Fisher. She used (6 × 8) × 12. Hmm, let me think about what that means. 

Wait, multiplication is associative, right? So, the way you group the numbers doesn't change the result. So, (6 × 8) × 12 is the same as 6 × (8 × 12). Oh wait, so that's option I. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option I is 6 × (8 × 12). That's exactly what she used. So, that should be the same. 

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through each option step by step. 

Option A: 12 × (6 + 8). That's 12 multiplied by the sum of 6 and 8. That's not the same as (6×8)×12. Her expression is 6×8×12, but A is 12×(6+8), which is 12×14=168. Whereas her expression is 6×8=48, 48×12=576. So A is different.

Option B: (6 + 8 + 12) × 6. That's adding all three and then multiplying by 6. 6+8 is 14, plus 12 is 26. 26 ×6=156. Her expression is 6×8×12=576, so B is 156, which is less than hers. Not the same.

Option C: 6 + (8 × 12). That's 6 plus (96). Because 8×12 is 96, so 6+96=102. Her expression is 576, so no match.

Option D: 6 + (8 +12). That's 6 plus 20, which is 26. No, not the same as 576.

Option E: 6 × (8 +12). 8+12 is 20, so 6×20=120. Not the same.

Option F: 8 × (6 +12). 6+12 is 18, 8×18=144. Still not 576.

Option G: (6+8) ×12. That's 14×12=168. Again, not 576.

Option H: 6 ×8 +12. That's 48 +12=60. No, not 576.

Option I: 6 × (8 ×12). As I thought earlier, that's 6×96=576, which matches her original expression. So I is the correct answer.

Option J: (6 ×8) +12. That's 48 +12=60. Not 576.

So, the only one that matches is option I.

The correct answer is I: 6 × (8 × 12).
