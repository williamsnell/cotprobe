Okay, so I need to figure out how many 8-ounce servings are in a 28-pound bag of dog food. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the bag weighs 28 pounds, and each serving is 8 ounces. I remember that pounds and ounces are different units. Oh wait, right, 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces. So, I need to convert pounds to ounces first.

So, 28 pounds times 16 ounces per pound. Let me calculate that: 28 * 16. Hmm, 28 times 10 is 280, and 28 times 6 is 168. Adding those together gives 448 ounces. So, the total dog food is 448 ounces.

Now, each serving is 8 ounces. To find out how many servings there are, I need to divide the total ounces by the serving size. So, 448 divided by 8. Let me do that division: 448 ÷ 8. 8 goes into 44 five times (5*8=40), remainder 4. Bring down the 8 to make 48. 8 goes into 48 six times. So, it's 56. So, 56 servings.

Wait, but let me double-check. 8 ounces times 56 servings equals 448 ounces, which matches the total. So yes, that makes sense.

Looking at the options: A is 280, which would be 280 divided by 8 is 35 pounds, which is way too much. B is 700, that's 700/8=87.5 pounds, which is more than the bag. C is 224, 224/8=28 pounds, which is less than the 28 pounds of the bag. D is 14, which is way too small. E is 500, 500/8=62.5, still more than 28. F is 350, 350/8=43.75. G is 56, which is correct. H is 112, 112/8=14. I is 448, which is the total ounces, not servings. J is 896, 896/8=112 pounds. So, the correct answer must be G, 56.

The correct answer is G: 56.

To determine how many 8-ounce servings are in a 28-pound bag, first convert pounds to ounces. Since 1 pound = 16 ounces, 28 pounds = 28 * 16 = 448 ounces. Each serving is 8 ounces, so the number of servings is 448 / 8 = 56.

Answer: G: 56
