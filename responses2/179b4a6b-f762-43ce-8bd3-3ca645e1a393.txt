Okay, so I have this question about the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and its major functional units. Hmm, I remember that the CPU is the brain of the computer, handling all the processing tasks. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

The question gives me a list of options from A to J, each stating what the CPU consists of. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I recall that the CPU typically has several major components. The first thing that comes to mind is the Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU). The ALU is responsible for performing arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. So options that mention ALU as a major unit are either A, D, C, G, or I. Wait, looking back, option A says ALU is a major unit, as does D, C, G, and I.

Wait, option A lists six major units: Control Unit (CU), ALU, ISU, Cache Memory, I/O, and Data Bus. Option D lists three: CU, ALU, ISU. Option G lists five units: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache, I/O. Option I is three: CU, ALU, ISU. Option C is four units: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache.

Wait, so I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what each component does. The Control Unit (CU) is responsible for managing the flow of the program (like addressing instructions and handling control flow). The Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU) is the core of the CPU for performing arithmetic and logical operations. The Internal Storage Unit (ISU) is where data and program instructions are stored. The Cache Memory is a separate unit that stores frequently used data for quick access.

Wait, the CPU's main components are the CU, ALU, ISU, and Cache. Oh, but I think the Cache is usually part of the main memory, not the storage unit. So perhaps the Cache Memory (CM) is considered part of the main memory, not an ISU. So the major functional units would include CU, ALU, ISU, and Cache.

Looking back at the options, option A lists six units. That's probably including more than necessary. Option D lists three: CU, ALU, ISU. Option I lists three: CU, ALU, ISU. Option G lists five: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache, I/O. So perhaps G is correct because it includes Cache and I/O Management. But wait, the Cache is a separate unit, not ISU. Wait, but sometimes ISU is considered part of the main memory.

Wait, maybe I should clarify: The Cache Memory is a separate storage unit, separate from ISU. So, the main units would be CU, ALU, ISU, and Cache. So that's four units. So looking at the options:

Option C: four units: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache. That sounds right.

Wait, but looking at option G, it also lists Cache as a major unit. So perhaps option G is the correct one because it includes Cache and I/O Management. But wait, the question is about major functional units. So, the Cache is a major unit, as is I/O Management.

Wait, let me look again.

Option C: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache Memory. So that's four units.

Option G: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache Memory, I/O Management. So that's five units.

The CPU is generally considered to have these four major units: Control Unit, Arithmetic Control Unit, Internal Storage Unit, and Cache Memory. But I'm not sure if I/O Management is considered a major unit. I think I/O is a major function of the CPU, but I'm not certain whether it's considered a separate major unit or part of another component.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The CPU's control unit (CU) manages the program's execution, including addressing instructions and handling control flow. The arithmetic control unit (ALU) is where the CPU does its arithmetic and logic operations. The internal storage unit (ISU) (like RAM) is where data and program instructions are stored. The cache memory is a separate memory unit that stores frequently used data, improving access speed.

So the major components would be CU, ALU, ISU, and Cache. So four units. So option C says four units: CU, ALU, ISU, Cache. That makes sense.

Option D says three units: CU, ALU, ISU. But according to what I thought, Cache is a separate unit, so D is incomplete. So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the Cache is considered part of the main memory, which is separate from ISU. So if the Cache is a separate unit, then option C is correct with four units. But option G includes Cache and I/O. I'm not sure if I/O is a major unit in the traditional sense of being a component of the CPU. Or perhaps I/O is a major function of the CPU, but not a major functional unit in the same way as the others.

Wait, the question is about major functional units. So the four units are CU, ALU, ISU, and Cache. So option C is correct.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the user's question is about the major functional units. The major components of the CPU are Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU), Internal Storage Unit (ISU), and Cache Memory. Wait, but ISU is usually part of the main memory, not an ISU. Hmm. So maybe the Cache is a separate unit, and the ISU is part of the main memory.

So, if the major units are CU, ALU, ISU, and Cache, that's four units. So option C is CU, ALU, ISU, Cache. So option C is correct.

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) consists of four major functional units: the Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Control Unit (ALU), Internal Storage Unit (ISU), and Cache Memory. These units work together to perform the core tasks of a computer. The Cache Memory, being a separate storage unit, improves data access speed. 

Option C correctly lists these four major units, making it the correct answer.
