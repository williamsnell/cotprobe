Okay, so I have this question about converting Celsius to Fahrenheit. Hmm, I remember that there's a formula to convert between the two scales. Let me think. Oh right! The formula is F equals (C multiplied by 9/5) plus 32. So F equals 1.8C plus 32.

The question says the Celsius temperature is 36.6°C. I need to find out what that is in Fahrenheit. So I substitute 36.6 into the formula. Let's calculate that step by step.

First, multiply 36.6 by 9/5. Well, 36.6 times 9 is... let me do that. 36 times 9 is 324, and 0.6 times 9 is 5.4. So 324 plus 5.4 is 329.4. Then I multiply that by 1 because 9/5 is the same as 1.8, but wait, I might have gotten confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I should do it straight. 36.6 multiplied by 9 is 329.4, and then divide by 5. Because 9/5 is the same as 1.8. 329.4 divided by 5 is 65.88. Then I add 32. So 65.88 plus 32 is 97.88°F.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should do 36.6 * 1.8. Let me try that. 36.6 times 1.8. Hmm, 36 * 1.8 is 64.8, and 0.6 * 1.8 is 1.08. So adding those gives 65.88. Then adding 32 gives 97.88°F. So that's approximately 97.9°F.

Looking at the options, option G is 97.9°, and option I might be 110°F. Wait, no. Let's see the options again. Option G is 97.9°, which is what I got. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait another thing: sometimes people get confused with the formula. Oh, wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 36.6 * 9/5. Let me compute it as 36.6 multiplied by 1.8.

36 * 1.8 is 64.8, and 0.6 *1.8 is 1.08. So 64.8 +1.08 is 65.88. Add 32 gives 97.88, which is 97.9°F. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option G is 97.9°, so the correct answer is G.

To convert 36.6°C to Fahrenheit, use the formula \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \). Calculating:

\[
36.6 \times \frac{9}{5} = 65.88
\]
\[
65.88 + 32 = 97.88 \approx 97.9^\circ F
\]

The closest answer is **97.9°F**, which corresponds to option **G**.

Answer: G
