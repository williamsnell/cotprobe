Question:

An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?

Options:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count
B: Decreased basophil count
C: Decreased macrophage activity
D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration
E: Increased macrophage activity
F: Decreased neutrophil count
G: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration
H: Increased eosinophil count
I: Increased lymphocyte count
J: Increased basophil count

Okay, so I've got this question here about medical students and their colds during finals week. The question is about an investigator looking at the incidence of upper respiratory infections. The hypothesis is that stress from studying makes students more susceptible to colds, so they're probably less immune. 

I remember that the immune system has various parts, and the question is about how stress affects the immune system. The options are a bunch of lab findings. I need to pick which one supports the hypothesis.

Hmm, let's think about what each of these lab tests measures. Lymphocyte count: I think lymphocytes are part of the immune system. Decreased lymphocyte count might mean fewer immune cells, so they can't fight infections. That would support the idea that they're less susceptible.

Basophil count: Basophils are a type of white blood cell. Basophils are pro-survival, meaning they help fight infections. Decreased basophil count would mean fewer of these cells, so the body isn't as protective against colds. That fits with the idea that stress makes them less immune.

Cortisol concentration: AM serum cortisol is released during stress. High cortisol might affect the immune system by making the body more sensitive. But if cortisol is high, maybe the immune system isn't working as well. Or perhaps it makes the body more susceptible to colds. I'm not so sure about this one. It could be a factor, but would it directly support the hypothesis? Maybe, but perhaps the other options are more direct.

Macrophage activity: Macrophages are part of the immune system too. Low macrophage activity would mean the immune response is weaker. That makes sense because if they're not active, the body isn't as immune against infections. So lower macrophage activity could support the idea that stress makes them more susceptible.

Neutrophil count: Neutrophils are immune cells that help fight infections. If there are too many, it's a problem. So high neutrophil count would support the hypothesis. But the question is about upper respiratory infections, which are more related to the immune system's ability to fight viruses. So neutrophils might be more about inflammation or infection, not directly the body's ability to fight the virus.

Eosinophil count: Eosinophils are another type of white blood cell involved in the fight against viral infections. If there's a high eosinophil count, the body is more susceptible. So this would support the hypothesis, but how much? 

Looking back at the options, the question asks which is most likely to support the hypothesis. So all the options except for maybe the cortisol one seem related to immune function.

The hypothesis is about stress (from studying) increasing susceptibility. So the body's immune system should be more vulnerable. So, if the lab tests show a decrease in some immune cells or activity, that would support it.

So options B (decreased basophil), A (decreased lymphocyte), C (decreased macrophage), H (increased eosinophil), I (increased lymphocyte). Wait, option I is increased lymphocyte, which would mean more immune cells, which is bad for the hypothesis.

Wait, the hypothesis is that stress makes the students more susceptible. So the immune system should be worse. So the lab findings should show a decrease in immune functions.

So which options show decreased immune function?

B: decreased basophil count. Basophils are protective.

A: Decreased lymphocyte count. That's bad, because less immune cells would make the body more susceptible.

C: Decreased macrophage activity. Again, that's bad. Less immune response means less protection.

H: Increased eosinophil count. That would support the idea, because eosinophils are part of the immune response to viral infections. So more of them would make the body more susceptible.

Wait, but the hypothesis is that stress makes the students more susceptible. So the body is more likely to be hit by colds. So if the stress makes the immune system worse, the students have more upper respiratory infections. Which lab findings would show that the immune system is compromised?

The question is about which finding would most likely support this hypothesis. So the answer would have a lower number of immune cells or less activity.

Looking at the options:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count. That's a strong indicator of a compromised immune response, making them more susceptible.

B: Decreased basophil count. Also bad, but less severe perhaps.

H: Increased eosinophil count. That's good because it's part of the body's defense against viral infections.

So the question is, which of these is most likely to support the hypothesis. So all the options except for perhaps the cortisol one are supportive.

Wait, the cortisol question: If cortisol is high, that might cause stress, which can make the immune system worse. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, cortisol could affect the body's ability to fight infections.

But the options are about lab findings. So the question is, which of these lab tests would indicate that the immune system is compromised.

So, the options are:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count → bad, more susceptible.

B: Decreased basophil → less protective → good.

H: Increased eosinophils → better, more susceptible.

So if the stress makes the students more susceptible, the lab showing a decrease in immune cells or activity would support this.

So the correct answer should be either A, B, or H.

But the options are presented as A-H, with each option being a possible answer.

Wait, the question is which is most likely to support the hypothesis. So the hypothesis is that stress makes them more susceptible. So the lab findings pointing to a more compromised immune system would support that.

So which of the options shows a compromised immune system?

Looking at the options:

Option B: decreased basophil count. Basophils help fight infections, so a decrease would mean their body isn't as protective. That's a good sign.

Option H: increased eosinophils. Eosinophils are part of the immune response to viral infections, so higher numbers would mean they're more susceptible.

So both B and H are possible. But the question is, which is the most likely to support the hypothesis.

Alternatively, the cortisol (D) is a factor. If they're stressed, cortisol is high. High cortisol might lead to increased stress responses, which could impair the immune system.

But I'm not certain if cortisol itself is a finding in these labs. The options include cortisol in D and G.

The question is about stress being the cause, not about cortisol as a result. So perhaps the cortisol is a factor but the question is about lab findings.

So the question is, which of the listed lab findings supports the hypothesis that stress makes the students more susceptible.

So the correct lab findings would be either a decrease in immune cells (A or H) or a decrease in protective white blood cells (B).

Looking at the options:

The options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

A: Decreased lymphocyte → bad (more susceptible).

B: Decreased basophil → good (less protective).

H: Increased eosinophil → good (more susceptible).

So which of the options is more likely to support the hypothesis.

The hypothesis is that stress makes them more susceptible. So the body's immune system is compromised, meaning more susceptible.

So the lab findings should show a decrease in the number of immune cells or a decrease in the number of immune cells that fight infections.

So both A and H are possible. But the options don't have both.

Wait, the options are: which is the correct answer.

So the options are A, B, H, and I.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

The options are:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count.

B: Decreased basophil count.

C: Decreased macrophage activity.

D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration.

E: Increased macrophage activity.

F: Decreased neutrophil count.

G: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration.

H: Increased eosinophil count.

I: Increased lymphocyte count.

J: Increased basophil count.

So the correct answer would be a finding that indicates the immune system is compromised. So, for example, H (Eosinophils up), or A (Lymphocytes down), or B (Basophils down), or I (Yeast, which is a different type of cell).

The question is about the last character of the answer. Wait, the user says the last character of the response must be the letter chosen. So the answer options are A-J, and the letters are the choices. So the correct answer is one of these letters.

The question is, which of these is most likely to support the hypothesis.

The hypothesis is that stress (from studying) makes them more susceptible, meaning the immune system is worse.

So, which of the lab findings shows a compromised immune system.

Looking at the options:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count → bad, more susceptible.

B: Decreased basophil count → less protective, good.

H: Increased eosinophils → good (more susceptible).

I: Increased lymphocyte count → bad, worse immune system.

So the correct answers would be either A, B, or H.

But the question is which is the most likely.

The options are presented as A to J, each as a possible answer, and the correct one is one of them.

So, which of these would indicate a more susceptible population.

I think the correct answer is either A: decreased lymphocyte count, or B: decreased basophil count. Or H: increased eosinophils.

Wait, but the question is about a hypothesis: stress makes them more susceptible. So the lab finding would be a decrease in the number of immune cells that can fight infections.

So in that case, both A (lymphocyte decrease) and H (eosinophils increase) would support the hypothesis.

But the options don't have both, so I have to choose between them.

But wait, the question is about the "most likely" to support. So which is a more direct indicator.

High stress (from study) leads to increased cortisol, which could be D or G. But the question is about the lab findings. So if the cortisol is high, it's D, but the stress causes the change in the immune system.

Wait, but the question is about the lab findings, not the results of the cortisol test itself.

So the hypothesis is that the stress (which leads to increased cortisol) causes the students to have a worse immune system, leading to more upper respiratory infections.

So the lab findings that show a worse immune system (less protective cells) would support this.

So the answer is either A, B, or H.

Looking back, H is increased eosinophil count. That's a positive finding; more eosinophils indicate the body is more susceptible.

But the question is about the hypothesis being that stress makes them more susceptible. So if the hypothesis is that stress (which itself is caused by the study leading to stress) makes the body worse, the lab findings should support that.

So if the stress leads to more eosinophils, that would be a good support.

But the stress is a factor in the hypothesis. So the hypothesis is that stress (caused by studying) leads to more susceptibility, which would be supported by a decrease in immune cells (like lymphocytes) or an increase in the cells that fight infections (like eosinophils).

So both A and H are correct, but the options are given as separate letters.

Wait, but the question is about which lab finding is most likely to support the hypothesis.

So the correct answer is either A, B, or H.

Looking back, H is increased eosinophil count. That's a positive finding, as it indicates a more susceptible population.

But the question is about the hypothesis being that stress makes them more susceptible. So the stress (caused by studying) is the reason for the increase in eosinophils.

So if the hypothesis is that stress (caused by studying) makes them more susceptible, the lab findings would show that the immune response is worse.

So the correct answers are: either a decrease in immune cells (A or H), or a decrease in protective cells (B).

But the question is to choose the most likely.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a different lab finding. The hypothesis is that stress (caused by study) makes them more susceptible.

So the correct lab findings would be one where the immune system is compromised, meaning the students have a worse immune response.

So A (lymphocyte count down) and H (eosinophils up) would both indicate a compromised immune system, which would support the hypothesis.

But the question is, which is more likely to support.

Looking at how stress affects the immune system: I think that stress can lead to a decrease in lymphocyte count. Because stress may cause the body to produce more pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can decrease the number of lymphocytes.

Wait, when stress occurs, the body releases various stress hormones, including cortisol. Stress hormones like cortisol can trigger an immune response, possibly leading to decreased lymphocyte counts. So that supports A.

Alternatively, increased eosinophil count (H) could be a direct result of the stress leading to more immune cells fighting viral infections.

So both A and H are possible. But which is more directly linked to stress? I'm a bit uncertain.

But the question is about the lab findings that support the hypothesis.

So the correct answer is either A, B, or H.

Looking back, H is an increased eosinophil count, which would be a positive finding. So if the stress leads to an increased number of eosinophils, that's a good support.

But the question is about the hypothesis that stress makes them more susceptible. So any lab finding that indicates a compromised immune system would support it.

So now, the options are A, B, H, and I.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The options are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

So the correct answer is either A, B, H, or I.

Wait, I think I should look for the most direct factor in the immune response. I remember that certain cytokines, like IL-17, are produced during stress and promote the production of eosinophils. Or maybe the stress leads to an increase in certain cells.

Alternatively, stress might lead to a decrease in the number of B cells or T cells, but the options don't include that.

In the given options, the correct answer is likely either A or H.

Wait, the question is about which lab finding is most likely to support the hypothesis. So, if the hypothesis is that stress makes the students more susceptible, the lab finding would show a decrease in immune cells that can fight infections or a decrease in protective cells.

So the correct answer is either A, H, or B.

Wait, but the question is which of the following is most likely to support the hypothesis. So the correct answer is the lab finding that best supports that.

Wait, the hypothesis is that stress (caused by study) leads to increased susceptibility. Therefore, the lab findings should show a more compromised immune system.

So now, the options are A, B, H, and I.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible lab findings.

Stress leads to a decrease in the number of B cells, which are pro-inflammatory and support the immune response. So the number of B cells would decrease, leading to a decrease in the number of lymphocytes (A) and a decrease in B cells (but not listed here).

In terms of eosinophils, increased eosinophils would indicate the immune system is more active, making the students more susceptible.

So both A and H are correct, but the question is which is the best answer.

The options are A-H, so the correct answer is either A, B, or H.

Wait, the question is about the last character: the correct answer is a letter. The options are A-J. So the correct answer is one of them.

Now, the options are:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count.

B: Decreased basophil count.

H: Increased eosinophils.

I: Increased lymphocyte count.

J: Increased basophil count.

So which of these would support the hypothesis.

So the correct lab findings would be a decrease in immune cells (lymphocytes) or increase in eosinophils.

So A and H are both correct.

But the question is about which is most likely to support the hypothesis, meaning which would support the idea that stress makes them more susceptible.

So, both A and H would support that. But the options don't have both; the correct answer is likely either A or H.

Wait, the question is about which is the best answer. So the answer is either A, B, H, or I.

But the options are presented as separate answers, and the correct answer is the one that matches.

Wait, another way to think: stress (from studying) leads to increased stress hormones, which can trigger a release of certain cytokines. These cytokines can lead to an increased production of B cells or T cells, but the options don't include this. The question is about lab findings.

So, which of the options are indicative of a compromised immune response.

In the lab, a decrease in lymphocyte count (A) would indicate a worse immune response. A decrease in B cells (not listed) would support it. An increase in eosinophils (H) would indicate the body is more susceptible.

So both A and H are correct.

Wait, but the options are separate letters, so the correct answer is either A or H.

Now, looking back, the question is about the last character of the answer. The correct letter would be the answer.

Wait, the options given are A to J, and the correct answer is one of them. So the correct answer is the one that is a finding of a compromised immune response, which would support the hypothesis.

So H is an increased eosinophils, which would be a positive finding.

But let me think about the options again. The correct answer is the one that is a finding of a compromised immune system, which would support the hypothesis that stress makes them more susceptible.

So, the correct answer is either A, B, or H.

But the question is about which is most likely. So, if the hypothesis is that stress (caused by study) leads to a more susceptible (more immune cells), then the lab finding would be an increase in the number of immune cells that can fight infections.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, no, the options are separate. So the correct answer is either A, B, H.

But among the options, the correct answer is A, B, H, or I.

Wait, I think I may have made a mistake. Let me think about the lab findings again.

Stress (like from study) can cause the release of certain cytokines. These can affect the immune response. For example, during stress, the body releases PDCs (pro-inflammatory cytokines). PDCs can activate the production of B cells, which are pro-inflammatory. But the question is about the lab findings.

Alternatively, stress can cause the release of proteins like B cells, leading to an increase in B cells. But the options don't include that.

So, if the lab shows a decrease in the number of B cells (which isn't listed), or a decrease in the number of lymphocytes, H is an increased number of eosinophils which would support the hypothesis.

So, the correct answer is H.

Wait, but the question is about the hypothesis that stress (from study) makes them more susceptible.

Wait, perhaps stress leads to a decrease in the number of B cells, which is a less likely option.

Alternatively, stress may lead to an increase in the number of B cells, but that's not part of the options.

So, the correct answer is either A, B, or H.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the lab findings.

Stress can lead to a decrease in the number of B cells, but that's not in the options.

Stress can lead to a decrease in the number of T cells, but that's not in the options either.

But in the options given, the correct answer is probably A, B, or H.

Wait, let me think about the stress and the immune response. Stress can cause the release of cytokines like IL-17, which can promote the production of B cells. So if the study causes stress, the body may produce more B cells, leading to an increase in B cells. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, stress can cause the release of certain cytokines, which can lead to the production of eosinophils, which would make the immune response more active, leading to more susceptibility.

So, the correct answer is H: increased eosinophil count.

Wait, but the question is about the hypothesis that stress makes them more susceptible. So any lab finding that indicates a compromised immune response would support it.

So now, the options are A, B, H, and I.

I think the correct answer is H: increased eosinophil count.
</think>

The question hypothesizes that studying causes stress, which would make medical students more susceptible to upper respiratory infections. To determine which laboratory finding supports this hypothesis, we analyze the options:

1. **Decreased Lymphocyte Count (A):** A decrease in lymphocytes indicates a compromised immune response, which would support the hypothesis. However, stress might lead to an increase in lymphocytes, so this is less likely.

2. **Decreased Basophil Count (B):** Basophils are protective immune cells. A decrease would indicate a compromised immune response, supporting the hypothesis. However, stress might also increase basophils, making this less likely.

3. **Increased Eosinophil Count (H):** Eosinophils are part of the immune response to viral infections. An increase would suggest the body is more susceptible, directly supporting the hypothesis.

4. **Increased Lymphocyte Count (I):** An increase would indicate a compromised immune response, which would support the hypothesis. However, stress might also increase lymphocytes.

5. **Increased Basophil Count (J):** An increase would indicate a compromised immune response, supporting the hypothesis. However, stress might also increase basophils.

6. **Decreased AM Serum Constellency Concentration (D):** This is a metabolite test and unrelated to immune response. Not relevant to the hypothesis.

7. **Decreased AM Serum Constellency Concentration (G):** Another metabolite test and unrelated. Not relevant to the hypothesis.

8. **Increased Macrophage Activity (E):** Increased macrophages could lead to stress responses or immune activation. Not directly relevant unless stress is a factor.

9. **Decreased Lymphocyte Count (A) and Increased Eosinophil Count (H):** Both A and H are strong indicators of a compromised immune response, which would support the hypothesis. Between the two, H directly relates to the immune response to viral infections.

Given the hypothesis that stress (caused by studying) leads to a compromised immune response, the most likely finding is **increased eosinophil count (H)**, as it directly supports the idea that the body is more susceptible to upper respiratory infections.

ANSWER: H
