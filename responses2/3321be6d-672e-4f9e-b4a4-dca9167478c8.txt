Okay, I have this linear algebra problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about vector spaces and matrices. Let me read it again and unpack the parts.

So, V is a real vector space of finite dimension n. M(V) is the space of all linear transformations from V to V, right? Because M(V) is the set of all matrices of size n x n if V is n-dimensional. So each element of M(V) is a matrix.

Then, T is an element of M(V). So T is a linear operator on V. Now, we have two subspaces: U and W.

U is defined as {X ∈ M(V) : TX = XT}. That is, U consists of all matrices X that commute with T. So U is the set of matrices that commute with T under multiplication.

W is defined as {TX − XT : X ∈ M(V)}. So W is the set of all commutators of the form [T, X] = TX - XT.

The question is about which of the three statements (I, II, III) must be TRUE.

Let me look at each statement one by one.

Statement I: If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then U = M(V).

Hmm. So if T has a basis consisting of eigenvectors, that means T is diagonalizable. Because if a single eigenbasis exists, T is similar to a diagonal matrix. So T is diagonalizable.

When T is diagonalizable, what does that say about the commuting matrices X?

I remember that if two operators are diagonalizable and they share a common eigenbasis, then any matrix that commutes with both is a polynomial in T. Wait, but U is the set of all matrices that commute with T. So does that mean U consists of matrices that can be expressed as polynomials of T?

Wait, if T is diagonalizable, then the set of matrices that commute with T is the set of all polynomials in T. Because if T is diagonal with entries t_1, t_2, ..., t_n, then any matrix X that commutes with T must be diagonal with entries a_1 t_1, a_2 t_2, ..., a_n t_n, for some scalars a_i. So all such X are polynomials in T. Hence, U is the space of all such matrices, which is the set of all linear combinations of the basis elements {I, T, T^2, ..., T^{n-1}}.

Wait, but wait. The dimension of U would be n, since there are n such basis vectors. Because each polynomial is determined by the coefficients a_1, ..., a_n. So if V is n-dimensional and T is diagonalizable, then U is n-dimensional, which is a subspace of M(V) which has dimension n². So U is a proper subspace, so U can't be all of M(V). Hence, statement I is claiming that U = M(V) in this case. But that's not true because, for example, if T is diagonal and n=2, then U is 2-dimensional (since any matrix commuting with T must be diagonal as well), but M(V) is 4-dimensional. So U is not equal to M(V). Therefore, statement I is false.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake here? Because I thought that if T is diagonalizable, then all X commuting with T are polynomials in T. So U would be a subspace of dimension n. But M(V) is n²-dimensional. So U is a proper subspace, so U isn't equal to M(V). Therefore, statement I is false. So statement I is NOT TRUE.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: The dimension of U is n, because it's the space spanned by {I, T, T², ..., T^{n-1}}. So that's a subspace of dimension n. Since M(V) is n²-dimensional, unless n=1, U can't be all of M(V). So for n>1, I is false. So statement I is false.

Statement II: dim(U) + dim(W) = n².

Hmm. Let me think about the dimensions.

I recall that M(V) can be decomposed into U and W. Because any matrix X can be written as X = (X/2 + X/2) = (X/2) + (X/2). Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, V is a vector space, so M(V) is a vector space of dimension n². Let's see.

The set U is the set of matrices that commute with T. The set W is {TX - XT | X ∈ M(V)}. So W is the commutator subspace. Now, from what I remember, the dimension of U plus the dimension of W is equal to n². Because M(V) can be expressed as the direct sum of U and W. Or perhaps, M(V) is the direct sum of U and W. Because any matrix X can be written as X = (X + 0)/2 + something? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, using the concept that M(V) is isomorphic to the space of linear transformations on V. So, when T is diagonal, the set of matrices commuting with T is known to be a subspace whose dimension is n. So dim U = n. Then dim W would be n² - n, which is (n² - n) = n(n-1). So their sum is n². So statement II would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case in general. Let me think again. Let me consider the case where T is diagonal. Then W would consist of all matrices of the form TX - XT, which for diagonal T would be matrices that are strictly upper triangular or strictly lower triangular. Because if T is diagonal, then TX is diagonal with entries t_i x_i, and XT is diagonal with entries x_i t_i, so their commutator is zero. Wait, no. Wait, if T is diagonal, then [T, X] = TX - XT. Let's compute that. T is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries t_1, t_2, ..., t_n. X is a general matrix.

Then [T, X] = TX - XT. Let's compute this. Let’s say X is a matrix with entries a_ij. Then, TX is a matrix where each entry (i,j) is t_i x_ij. And XT is where each entry (i,j) is x_ji t_i. So their difference is (t_i x_ij - x_ji t_i). So for each (i,j), the entry is t_i (x_ij - x_ji) if i != j, and zero on the diagonal because t_i x_ii - x_ii t_i = 0. So the commutator is a strictly upper triangular (or lower) matrix? Wait, no. Let's see. For i < j, x_ij is an entry, and x_ji is another. So the difference is t_i (x_ij - x_ji). So for i < j, [T, X] has an entry (i,j) equal to t_i (x_ij - x_ji). So this is a strictly upper triangular matrix only if i < j, because for i < j, (i,j) is upper. So W is exactly the set of strictly upper triangular matrices (or strictly lower, depending on whether X is on the left or right). So the dimension of W is (n(n-1))/2, which is equal to (n² - n)/2. So if n=2, W would have dimension (4-2)/2=1. So for n=2, dim U is 2, dim W is 1, which sums to 3 = 4 -1 = 3. So in that case, dim U + dim W = 2 +1=3=4² - 2²? Wait, no. Wait, 2 +1=3, which is 2² - n =4 - 2=2? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, n=2: dim M(V) = 4. If U has dim 2, W has dim 1. 2 +1=3, which is 4 -1 =3. So yes, 3=4 -1. So for n=2, statement II is true.

In general, for any n, dim U is n and dim W is (n² -n), so their sum is n². So statement II is true.

Statement III: dim(U) < n.

Wait, earlier I thought statement I is false because if V has a basis of eigenvectors, then U is n-dimensional, so dim U =n, which is not less than n. So statement III is claiming that dim U <n, which would be false if dim U is equal to n. So statement III is false.

Wait, wait. Wait, statement I says that if V has a basis of eigenvectors of T, then U = M(V). But from earlier analysis, if T is diagonalizable, then U is of dimension n, which is less than M(V) which is n². So statement I is claiming that U equals M(V), but in reality, U is a proper subspace. So statement I is false.

Wait, no, wait a minute. Let me recheck. If T is diagonalizable, then U consists of all matrices that commute with T. So U is a set of matrices that are polynomials in T, as I thought earlier. So for a diagonalizable T, V is a basis of eigenvectors, which means T is similar to a diagonal matrix. So any matrix that commutes with T is a polynomial in T. So U is all matrices of the form a_0 I + a_1 T + a_2 T² + ... + a_{n-1} T^{n-1}. So that's a subspace of dimension n. So U is a proper subspace of M(V), so statement I is false because U is not equal to M(V).

So Statement I is false. Statement II is true, statement III is false.

Wait, but no. Let me double-check statement III.

Statement III: dim(U) < n.

If dim U is n, then it's not less than n. So statement III is false.

Wait, but wait. The problem is, V is n-dimensional. So, for example, if n=1, then statement I would say that U = M(V) (which is 1-dimensional). But for n=1, any matrix that commutes with T is just scalar multiples of the identity, which is M(V). So U would be M(V), so statement I is true. But wait, statement I says that if V has a basis of eigenvectors (which is trivial when n=1), then U=M(V). So statement I is true for n=1, but in general, when n>1, statement I is false.

So statement I is not necessarily true, because it depends on n. Wait, but the question is, "which of the following must be TRUE." So if for some cases statement I is true, but for others it's false, then statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is false.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me reevaluate statement I again.

Statement I: If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then U = M(V).

As earlier examples: For n=1, yes. For n=2, no. So it's not always true. So statement I is false.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let's think again. If V has a basis of eigenvectors, then T is diagonalizable. So U is all matrices that commute with T, which is the set of all polynomials in T. So U is the space of matrices that can be expressed as a linear combination of I, T, T², ..., T^{n-1}. The dimension of U is n. So U is a subspace of dimension n in M(V), which has dimension n². So unless n=1, U can't be all of M(V). So statement I is false.

So statement I is false. So that leaves us with statement II and statement III.

Statement II: dim(U) + dim(W) =n².

As per my earlier example, when n=2, dim(U)=2, dim(W)=1. So 2+1=3=4-1=3. So yes, in that case, the sum is 3= n² -1. Wait, for n=2, n²=4, so 4-1=3. So yes, in general, dim(U) + dim(W) = n² - n? Wait, for n=2, it's 3, which is 2² - 2=2, no. Wait, wait, 2² - 2=2. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Another way: If V is n-dimensional, then M(V) has dimension n². If T is diagonal, then U is the set of matrices that are polynomials in T. So dim U =n. W is the set of commutators, which for diagonal T is strictly upper triangular (n(n-1)/2). So dim W is (n² -n)/2 = n(n-1)/2. So dim U + dim W = n + (n² -n)/2 = [2n +n² -n]/2 = (n² +n)/2.

But wait, the sum is (n² +n)/2, but the total dimension of M(V) is n². So (n² +n)/2 would be less than n², so statement II is saying that their sum is n², which is only true when (n² +n)/2 = n² → n² +n = 2n² → n=0, which is impossible. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps W is not (n² -n)/2. Let me compute dim W again. For diagonal T, W is the set of matrices [T, X], and X is a general matrix.

So X can be written as X_ij = x_{ij} δ_{ij}, where δ is the Kronecker delta. Then [T, X] is (T X - X T). T is diagonal, so T X is diagonal with entries t_i x_{ii}, and X T is X diagonal with entries x_{ii} t_i. So their commutator is zero? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: [T, X] is T X - X T. So for each entry (i,j):

(T X)_{i,j} = t_i x_{i,j}.

(X T)_{i,j} = x_{j,i} t_i.

So [T, X]_{i,j} = t_i x_{i,j} - x_{j,i} t_i = t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i}).

So for i != j, the entries are t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i}).

So for each i < j, the entry (i,j) is t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i}).

So the commutator matrix is strictly upper triangular (for i < j) and strictly lower triangular (for i > j), but in reality, for i < j, it's strictly upper triangular? Or is it?

Wait, for i < j, (i,j) is (i,j) in the matrix. For i < j, x_{i,j} is an entry, x_{j,i} is another. So the (i,j) entry of [T, X] is t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i}).

So for i < j, (i,j) is part of the upper triangle, but (j,i) is part of the lower triangle.

But for each i, the (i,i) entry is zero. So the commutator matrix is zero on the diagonal and has non-zero entries above and below for i < j.

Wait, no. Because for i < j, (i,j) is part of the upper triangle, and (j,i) is part of the lower triangle. So the commutator matrix doesn't have to be strictly upper or lower triangular; it can have non-zero entries in both.

Wait, but in the case where T is diagonal, the commutator [T, X] is a matrix where each entry (i,j) is t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i}).

So for i < j, (i,j) is part of the upper triangle, and (j,i) is part of the lower. So the commutator matrix is not strictly upper or lower triangular. Therefore, the dimension of W is the number of independent entries in such a matrix.

But perhaps W is the entire space of strictly upper triangular matrices. Because for each i < j, (i,j) can be any value, while (j,i) is determined by (i,j) through the equation (i,j) = t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i}).

Wait, that's a bit tricky. Let me think: For each (i,j) with i < j, the (i,j) entry is t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i}). So x_{i,j} can be any value, and x_{j,i} can be any value, but they are related by x_{j,i} = x_{i,j} + (x_{j,i} - x_{i,j}) = x_{i,j} + t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i} )? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the commutator matrix can be any matrix with arbitrary entries above the diagonal, but the entries below are determined by the entries above.

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think: For a given (i,j) where i < j, the (i,j) entry in [T, X] is t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i} ). So for each i and j where i < j, I can choose x_{i,j} and x_{j,i} such that any combination is possible. So perhaps the space of such matrices is the entire space of strictly upper triangular matrices plus the strictly lower triangular? Or perhaps it's a direct sum of the strictly upper and strictly lower triangular parts.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that for a given (i,j) where i < j, the (i,j) entry can be any scalar (because x_{i,j} and x_{j,i} can vary to give any [T, X]_{i,j} = t_i (x_{i,j} - x_{j,i} )). So for each i, j with i < j, the (i,j) entry is arbitrary. But then, the (j,i) entry is determined by [T, X]_{j,i} = t_j (x_{j,i} - x_{i,j} ). So x_{j,i} = x_{i,j} + (x_{j,i} - x_{i,j} ), which would imply x_{j,i} = x_{i,j} + [T, X]_{j,i} / t_j.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should rely on the fact that when T is diagonal, the dimension of U is n, and the dimension of W is n² -n, which would make their sum n². So statement II would be correct.

So statement II is correct.

Statement III: dim(U) < n.

But when n=1, dim(U)=1, which is not less than n=1. So statement III is false.

So to summarize:

Statement I: False.

Statement II: True.

Statement III: False.

So the correct answer is B, which is II.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck statement II. If V has a basis of eigenvectors, then U is a subspace of M(V) with dimension n. The dimension of W is (n² -n)/2, because for diagonal T, W is the set of strictly upper triangular matrices. So dim U + dim W = n + (n² -n)/2 = [2n + n² -n ]/2 = (n² +n)/2. But the total dimension of M(V) is n². So (n² +n)/2 = n² → n² +n = 2n² → n² -n =0 → n(n-1)=0 → n=0 or n=1. So for n=0 or n=1, the sum is n², but for n>1, the sum is less than n². So statement II is saying that for any V, the sum is n², which is not true. So statement II is false. Wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions now.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me think again.

If T is diagonal, then W is the set of all matrices where each off-diagonal entry is determined by the diagonal entries. So for each i < j, the (i,j) entry can be any value, while the (j,i) entry is determined by (i,j) and the diagonal entries. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure here.

Alternatively, perhaps W is the set of strictly upper triangular matrices, which would have dimension (n² -n)/2. Then, the sum of dim U (n) and dim W (n(n-1)/2) would be [n² -n + 2n]/2 = [n² +n]/2 = (n² +n)/2. But the total dimension of M(V) is n². So (n² +n)/2 is not equal to n² for n>1. So statement II is false.

Wait, this is getting really confusing. Let me try to find a solid conclusion.

Statement I: If V has a basis of eigenvectors of T, then U=M(V). But for n=2, this is false. So statement I is false.

Statement II: dim(U) + dim(W) = n². Let me test this for n=2. If V has a basis of eigenvectors, then U is 2-dimensional, W is 1-dimensional, sum is 3=4-1=3. So correct. For n=3, if V has a basis of eigenvectors, U is 3-dimensional, W is 6-dimensional? No, wait, n=3, W would be (3² -3)/2= (9-3)/2=3. So dim U + dim W =6. But M(V) is 9. So 6 ≠9. So the statement II is not true for n=3. So statement II is false.

Wait, but earlier when I thought I thought statement II was true, that was a mistake.

So statement II is false.

Statement III: dim(U) <n. For n=1, dim U=1, which is not less than 1. So statement III is false.

So the only correct statement is II?

Wait, but earlier I thought statement II was correct, but that's because I made a mistake in reasoning. Now, in reality, statement II is incorrect because for n>1, the sum of dim U and dim W is less than n².

So the correct answer must be II. So option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about statement II. If V has a basis of eigenvectors, then U is n-dimensional, and W is (n² -n)/2. So their sum is n + (n² -n)/2 = [2n +n² -n ]/2 = (n² +n)/2. And M(V) has dimension n². So for (n² +n)/2 to equal n², we need n² +n =2n² → n² -n=0 → n=0 or n=1. So for n>1, statement II is false. So statement II is only true for n=0 or 1. So given that, statement II is not always true.

Therefore, the correct answer is statement II, which is option B.
</think>

Now, let's analyze each statement carefully.

1. **Statement I**: "If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then U = M(V)."  
   - **Analysis**: If V has a basis of eigenvectors for T, then T is diagonalizable. In this case, U consists of all matrices that commute with T. For a diagonal matrix T, these commuting matrices are polynomials in T, which form a subspace of dimension n. However, U is not equal to M(V) for n > 1, as U is a proper subspace. Thus, **Statement I is false**.

2. **Statement II**: "dim U + dim W = n²."  
   - **Analysis**: For V having a basis of eigenvectors, dim U = n and dim W = (n² - n)/2. Adding these gives n + (n² - n)/2 = (n² + n)/2. This is only equal to n² when n = 0 or n = 1. For n > 1, (n² + n)/2 < n², so **Statement II is false**.

3. **Statement III**: "dim U < n."  
   - **Analysis**: For n = 1, dim U = 1, which is not less than 1. Thus, **Statement III is false**.

### Conclusion:
None of the statements are true. However, since the question asks for which statement is true, and none are true, the correct answer is **E) None of the above**.

ANSWER: E
