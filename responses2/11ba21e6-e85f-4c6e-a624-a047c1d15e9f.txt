Question:

Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.

 For example, if 1istl contains
 ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"]
 and 1ist2 contains
 ["Frankenstein", "Dracula, "Macbeth", "Hamlet"],
 then newList will contain
 ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"].

 The following procedures are available to create newList.
 Procedure
 Explanation
 Sort (list)
 Sorts list in alphabetical order and returns the resulting list.
 Combine (listl, list2)
 Creates a new list consisting of the entries from
 list1 followed by the entries from list2. The resulting list is returned.
 RemoveDuplicates (list)
 Iterates through list. If any two or more entries have the same value, the duplicate entries are removed so that any entry appears at most once. The resulting list is returned.

 Which of the following code segments will correctly create newList?

Options:

A: newList ← Combine (list1, list2)
B: listl ← Sort (listl)
 list2 ← Sort (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← RemoveDuplicates (newList)
C: newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)
 newList ← RemoveDup1icates (newList)
D: list1 ← RemoveDuplicates (list1)
E: listl ← RemoveDuplicates (listl)
 list2 ← RemoveDuplicates (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, 1ist2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)
F: newList ← Sort (list1)
G: list1 ← Sort (list1)
H: listl ← RemoveDuplicates (listl)
 listl ← Sort (listl)
 list2 ← RemoveDuplicates (list2)
 1ist2 ← Sort (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, list2)

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct code segment to create newList. Let's break it down step by step.

The goal is to have newList contain the names of all books from both list1 and list2, sorted alphabetically without duplicates. So the process involves combining both lists, sorting them, and then removing any duplicates.

Looking at the options, I need to see which sequence of steps achieves that.

Option A: Combine list1 and list2. Then Sort. But combining them would just concatenate, not sort. So that won't work because I need to sort the combined list.

Option B: Sort list1 and list2, then Combine them. Wait, no. The Combine function in programming typically appends elements, but the example shows that the result should be sorted. So combining and then sorting might work, but also the RemoveDuplicates step is needed.

Wait, let me look at the steps in each option.

Option D: RemoveDuplicates from list1, then RemoveDuplicates from list2. Then Combine them. But that would remove duplicates from each, then combine, then sort. But that's not efficient, and the RemoveDuplicates function in the problem description might not have the same effect. Because the problem says RemoveDuplicates is a function that removes any duplicate entries, so applying it to each would leave each list with unique entries. Then combining them would give a combined list, but then we need to sort them. But if you first combine and then sort, that's the right approach. But looking at the steps in Option B, it's Sort(list1), Sort(list2), then Combine them. That would sort each, then combine, then sort again. But the RemoveDuplicates approach would remove duplicates before combining, then sort. But that's not what the problem says. The problem expects to combine the two lists, sort them, and remove duplicates. So the correct approach is to combine, sort, then remove duplicates.

Wait, but let's check the options again.

Option B: It says list1 is set to Sort(list1), list2 is set to Sort(list2), then Combine them. So after sorting both, they are combined, then sort again. That would not be correct because the Combine step is after the sorts, which would sort the combined list. But the problem states that newList should have all entries from both, sorted, with duplicates removed. So the correct steps should sort first, then combine, then RemoveDuplicates.

Looking at the options, which one does that?

Option B is: listl ← Sort(listl), list2 ← Sort(list2), newList ← Combine(listl, list2), newList ← RemoveDuplicates(newList). Wait, but the initial step was listl and list2 being sorted, then combined, then duplicates removed. So the order would be:

1. Sort listl.
2. Sort list2.
3. Combine them into a new list.
4. Remove duplicates from this new list.

But that would be correct.

Let me look at option B: it's combining after the sorts, then removing duplicates. So the resulting list is the combined, sorted, and duplicates removed. So that's correct.

Option B is step by step: Sort list1, Sort list2, Combine the sorted lists, then RemoveDuplicates. So the final list would be correct.

Another approach is to remove duplicates first, then combine and sort. Option B's approach is to sort each, combine, then sort again. But that's not the same as combining, sorting, then removing duplicates. Because combining and sorting would have already sorted the data, so duplicates might be in the same order. But the correct approach is to combine all, sort, then remove duplicates.

So in option B, the steps are:

sort list1 → list1 is now sorted.

sort list2 → list2 is now sorted.

combine them → so the two sorted lists are concatenated. Then, sort the combined list → which is the same as the first two steps, because sorting the combined list after sorting each would be the same as just combining and sorting once. But the problem requires to remove duplicates before combining. So option B's order is incorrect because it removes duplicates only after combining and sorting, which may not be the right approach.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

The problem says that newList should contain all the books from both collections, in alphabetical order, with duplicates removed.

So the correct steps are:

- Combine list1 and list2 into a single list.

- Sort this combined list in alphabetical order.

- Remove any duplicate entries from this sorted list.

So the correct order is: Combine, sort, remove duplicates.

Looking back at the options, the correct option would be one that does Combine, then Sort, then RemoveDuplicates.

Looking at Option D: list1 is sorted, list2 is sorted, then combined. Then combined is sorted again, then RemoveDuplicates. Wait, no. Because the Combine step is after the sorts. So that's combining the sorted lists, which would be in order, and then sorting again would make it unsorted. So that's not correct.

Option B: After sorting both, then Combine, then Sort again. So that's combining the two sorted lists (so they're both in order), then sorting the combined list. That would result in a single sorted list, but then duplicates are already removed because all entries are unique in a sorted list. So in this case, the Combine and Sort steps would result in a list that's the union of both lists, sorted. But then, the RemoveDuplicates step is redundant because in the Combine step, duplicates are already removed. Wait, no. Because the problem expects to remove duplicates first, then combine, then sort.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: the problem requires that the final list has all the books from both collections, in alphabetical order, with duplicates removed.

So the correct steps are:

1. Combine list1 and list2 into a single list.

2. Sort this combined list.

3. Remove any duplicate entries from this sorted list.

So the correct sequence is Combine, Sort, RemoveDuplicates.

Looking at the options, the correct one should have:

Combine list1 and list2 → Sort the result → Remove duplicates.

Which is what option B does. Let me check option B:

Option B: list1 ← Sort(listl), list2 ← Sort(list2), newList ← Combine(listl, list2), newList ← RemoveDuplicates(newList).

Wait, but this would be:

After the Sorts, listl and list2 are already sorted. Then Combine them, which appends the two sorted lists, resulting in a single sorted list (since each is already sorted). Then, the RemoveDuplicates step is applied to this new list. But in this case, the two sorted lists may have duplicates between them. For example, listl contains ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein"] and list2 has ["Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. After sorting, listl is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein"], list2 is ["Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Wait no, wait list2 after Sort would be ["Macbeth", "Hamlet"]? Or is list2 ["Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]?

Wait, no, the initial list2 in the example is ["Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"], which when sorted becomes ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet"]. So listl after Sort is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein"], list2 after Sort is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet"]. Combining them would result in ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet"]. Then, when you call RemoveDuplicates, you remove duplicate entries, so the duplicates are removed. But wait, in the example, the correct newList is ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"], which includes all entries from both lists, sorted, with duplicates removed. So in this case, the Combine step after sorting would have a combined list with duplicates, and then RemoveDuplicates would eliminate them. So the final list would be ["Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Dracula", "Hamlet"]? Wait, but the example says the result is ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"], which is in alphabetical order.

Wait, but in the example, list1 is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"] and list2 is ["Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. So combining them gives ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. When sorted, it becomes ["Macbeth", "Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Hamlet"]. Then, RemoveDuplicates would result in ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Hamlet"], which is not what the example shows. Wait, but the example's newList is ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"], which is sorted as ["Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Dracula"]? Wait, no. Let me check the example again.

Wait, the example says list1 is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"], list2 is ["Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"], and newList is ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"]. Wait, that can't be right because list1 and list2 don't have "Dracula". Oh, perhaps the example is incorrect, but in any case, the process is to combine both, sort, and remove duplicates.

So regardless of the example's specific outcome, the correct order is to combine, sort, then remove duplicates.

Looking at option B: it does that.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option B: newList ← Combine(listl, list2), which is the current list after both have been sorted. Then, newList ← RemoveDuplicates(newList). So after combining, you sort, then remove duplicates. Which is correct.

So the correct code is Option B: listl ← Sort(listl), list2 ← Sort(list2), Combine into newList, then RemoveDuplicates.

Wait, but the code in option B is:

listl ← Sort(listl)

list2 ← Sort(list2)

newList ← Combine(listl, list2)

newList ← RemoveDuplicates(newList)

But wait, after the first two steps, listl and list2 are already sorted. Then combining them will create a list that is the concatenation of two sorted lists, which is also sorted. So combining them would result in a single sorted list, but then you call RemoveDuplicates, which would remove duplicates. But in the problem, the Combine step should be followed by Sort, not Combine and then Sort.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: create newList, which contains all books from both collections, in alphabetical order, with duplicates removed. So the correct steps are:

1. Combine list1 and list2 into a single list.

2. Sort this combined list.

3. Remove duplicates from this sorted list.

So the correct sequence is: Combine, Sort, RemoveDuplicates.

Looking at the options, the only one that does this is option B. Because:

- listl is sorted (so the original listl is sorted)

- list2 is sorted (so the original list2 is sorted)

- Combine them → now you have all entries from both, in order, but duplicates may exist.

- Then, RemoveDuplicates is applied to this combined list, which would eliminate duplicates from the sorted combined list.

Wait, but after combining, the lists are already sorted, so combining them would result in a single sorted list, but with duplicates. So the RemoveDuplicates would remove duplicates, leading to a list that's the union of both lists, sorted, without duplicates.

Wait, but that's the correct approach. So the correct code is option B.

Wait, but in the example, when listl and list2 are combined, they would be ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. After Sort, it's ["Macbeth", "Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Hamlet"]. Then, RemoveDuplicates would eliminate the duplicates, resulting in ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Hamlet"], which is not the example's expected newList. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me check the problem statement again.

The example says:

list1 = ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"]

list2 = ["Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]

So combining them gives: ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]

Sort this list would result in: ["Macbeth", "Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Hamlet"]

Then, RemoveDuplicates would remove the duplicates, leaving ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Hamlet"].

But the expected newList in the example is ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"]. Wait, that's not matching. So perhaps the example is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the process.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The problem says that the final newList should contain all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicates removed. So the correct newList is the combination of both lists, sorted, and duplicates removed.

So the correct steps are to combine, sort, then remove duplicates.

Looking at the options, the only one that does this is option B.

Because:

Listl is sorted → list1 is now ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"]

List2 is sorted → list2 is now ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet"]

Combine them → ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet"]

Sort this → ["Macbeth", "Macbeth", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet"]

Then RemoveDuplicates → ["Macbeth", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet"]

But the example's expected newList is ["Dracula", ...], which doesn't match. So perhaps the example is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem description is correct, but the example is a mistake. Because the correct newList after combining and sorting should have all entries, duplicates removed, in alphabetical order.

So option B's approach is correct because it combines, sorts, then removes duplicates.

But perhaps the problem statement expects a different order, like Combine, then Sort, then RemoveDuplicates.

Wait, that's what option B does.

Wait, no. Wait, the correct steps are Combine, sort, then RemoveDuplicates.

So the correct code is option B.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: listl ← Sort(listl), list2 ← Sort(list2), newList ← Combine(listl, list2), newList ← RemoveDuplicates(newList)

So that's the correct sequence.

So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The correct approach is to combine the two lists, sort them, and then remove duplicates. Option B achieves this by first sorting both lists, combining them, then removing duplicates.
