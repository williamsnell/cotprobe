Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let me read it again. It says, "Water stands 12.0 m deep in a storage tank whose top is open to the atmosphere. What are the gauge pressures at the bottom of the tank? The options are given from A to J." Hmm.

Wait, gauge pressure. Right, gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. So when the question says "atmospheric pressure," that means it's measuring the pressure difference, not including atmospheric.

I remember that the formula for gauge pressure in a fluid is P = ρgh. Oh wait, but wait. Since the top is open, does that mean atmospheric pressure is acting on the top? Or is the pressure at the bottom the sum of atmospheric and the gauge pressure from the water column?

No, wait. Gauge pressure is the difference between the absolute pressure and atmospheric. So when you have a container open to the atmosphere, the atmospheric pressure is present at the top, and as water flows down, the gauge pressure increases. 

But the question specifically asks for the gauge pressure at the bottom. So I think the formula would be P = ρgh, where ρ is the density of water, g is gravity, and h is the height of the water column.

Wait, what's the density of water? I think it's about 1000 kg/m³, right? And g is approximately 9.81 m/s². So let's plug in the numbers.

h is 12.0 meters. So 1000 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s² * 12.0 m.

Let me calculate that. 1000 * 9.81 is 9810. Multiply by 12: 9810 *12. Let's see, 9810*10 is 98100, 9810*2 is 19620. So 98100 +19620 = 117720. So P = 117720 Pa.

Wait, the question asks for the gauge pressure in units of 1e5 Pa. Oh right, so 1e5 is 100,000. So 117720 Pa / 1e5 = 1.1772. So approximately 1.18, which is option G.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh, wait, wait a minute. The formula is correct, but wait, is the pressure being calculated as gauge pressure, or absolute? Because sometimes, when you have a fluid in a container open to the atmosphere, the gauge pressure at the bottom is ρgh. Because the atmospheric pressure (P_atm) is subtracted from the total pressure (which is P_atm + ρgh) to get the gauge pressure.

Wait, no. Wait, the gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric. So if the tank is open to the atmosphere, the absolute pressure at the bottom would be P_abs = P_atm + ρgh. But the gauge pressure is P_gauge = P_abs - P_atm = ρgh. So that's correct.

So for 12 meters, it's 1000 * 9.81 * 12 = 117720 Pa. So gauge pressure is 117720 Pa. Converting to 1e5 units: 117720 / 1e5 = 1.1772, so 1.18, which is option G.

To determine the gauge pressure at the bottom of the storage tank, we use the formula for pressure in a fluid column:

\[
P = \rho g h
\]

Here:
- \( \rho \) (density of water) = \( 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \),
- \( g \) (acceleration due to gravity) = \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \),
- \( h \) (height of the water column) = \( 12.0 \, \text{m} \).

Substituting these values:

\[
P = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \cdot 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 12.0 \, \text{m} = 117720 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

Since the question asks for the gauge pressure in units of \( 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \), we divide by \( 10^5 \):

\[
P_{\text{gauge}} = \frac{117720}{10^5} = 1.1772 \, \text{units}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, this is approximately \( 1.18 \, \text{units} \). Comparing this value to the options provided, it matches **Option G: 1.18**.
