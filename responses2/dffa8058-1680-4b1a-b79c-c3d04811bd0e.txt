Okay, so I need to figure out the color of Marge Simpson's hair. Let me think about this. Marge is a well-known character from "Marge and the Puffin." I remember she's a character from a show that's pretty popular. Now, I'm trying to recall if there's any specific color mentioned about her hair. 

I think about the other characters in the show. Marge is often depicted as a cheerful and playful character, so maybe her hair isn't too dark. Let me visualize her. I'm pretty sure she has a longer, maybe a bit wavy, blonde or something like that. Like, I think her hair is often described as having a "golden blonde" look. That would mean it's brown, right?

Wait, but sometimes people might say it's a lighter shade. But in terms of primary colors, brown is one of the options here. Looking at the options, option A is brown. So that must be the answer.

The correct answer is A: brown. Marge Simpson's hair is typically depicted as golden blonde, which corresponds to a brown color.
