Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about duties and rights related to goods and services. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which of the given options is an example of a duty that corresponds to a right to goods and services. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to recall what duties and rights are. A duty is a responsibility someone has because they have a right to goods or services. So, for example, if someone has a right to a car, they might have a duty to return it if it's stolen.

Looking at the options:

Option A: John's duty to return to Mary that car he borrowed from her. That sounds like a duty because he has a right to have a car, so he's responsible for returning it if it's stolen. That makes sense.

Option B: John's duty to allow Mary to pursue goals she values. Hmm, this seems more about Mary's interests than a duty based on her right to goods. It's about Mary's desires, not necessarily something that John is legally bound to do because of his ownership rights.

Option C: John's duty to not harm Mary. This is about protecting Mary's well-being, not about the ownership of goods. It's more about safety and personal well-being, which is a different kind of duty.

Option D: John's duty to not commit suicide. That's a serious act of violence. Not related to ownership of goods, so probably not the right answer.

So the main point is that the duty corresponds to a right to goods and services. Option A directly ties his duty to the right he has to return the car, which he should do if it's stolen. The others don't directly tie to the ownership rights.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So the question is which example is an example of a duty corresponding to a right to goods/services. So the duty is a responsibility because of the right.

Option B is about Mary's interests, which doesn't directly tie to the ownership right. Option C is about Mary's well-being, which is a different area. So yes, Option A is the correct one.

The correct answer is A: John's duty to return to Mary that car he borrowed from her. This reflects a duty based on his right to goods/services, as he has a responsibility to return the car if stolen. 

Answer: A
