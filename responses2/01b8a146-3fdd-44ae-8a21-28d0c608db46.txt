Okay, so I've got this question about counting rates and radioactive decay. Hmm, let me see. Let's break it down. The problem says there's a solution containing P^32, which is a beta emitter with a half-life of 14 days. It's surrounding a Geiger counter that records 10^3 counts per minute. The experiment is done 28 days later, and we need to find the new counting rate.

Wait, so P^32 is a beta emitter. Beta emitters decay by beta particles, right? Beta minus decay occurs when a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. Beta emitters are typically stable or have a short half-life. P^32 has a half-life of 14 days. Got it.

So, the initial count rate is 1000 counts per minute. But after 28 days, how does that change? Since the half-life is 14 days, 28 days is exactly two half-lives. I remember that each half-life reduces the activity by half.

Wait, but wait, this is a counting process, not just the number of decays. Each decay event produces a count. So, activity is the number of decays per second. But the decay constant is involved here. The formula for activity is A = λN, where λ is the decay constant and N is the number of atoms.

The half-life T_1/2 is related to the decay constant λ by T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ. So, λ = ln(2)/T_1/2.

But wait, the activity also depends on the number of atoms present. Since the half-life is 14 days, after 28 days, which is two half-lives, the number of atoms would be (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of the original. But activity is proportional to the number of atoms and the decay constant.

Wait, but the activity after time t would be A_t = A_0 * (1/2)^(t / T_1/2). Let me think. Since each half-life halves the number of atoms, the activity (which is proportional to the number of decays) would also be halved each half-life.

So, the initial count rate is 1000 counts/min. After one half-life (14 days), it would drop to 500. After two half-lives (28 days), it would drop to 250. Because each half-life halves the activity.

Wait, but wait, the question says "the same experiment is performed 28 days later." So the time elapsed is 28 days. Since the half-life is 14 days, that's exactly two half-lives. So the activity (which is the counting rate) would be 1000 / (2^2) = 1000 /4 =250. So the new counting rate would be 250 counts per minute.

Looking at the options, option H is 750, D is 250. So, option D is 250.

Wait, but another thing: the Geiger counter is recording counts. How does the counting rate change? Well, counting rate (gamma) is a function of the activity (A) and the quantum efficiency (η) of the Geiger-Muller tube. But the question doesn't mention anything about efficiency, so I probably assume it's 100% efficient, so the gamma remains the same as the activity.

So the new gamma would be 250 counts/min.

Wait, but the question says the same experiment is performed 28 days later. So the initial gamma is 1000, and the activity halves each half-life. Two half-lives mean 1000 -> 500 -> 250. So the answer is D:250.

The problem involves a solution containing P\(^{32}\), a \(\beta\)-emitter with a half-life of 14 days, surrounding a Geiger counter that initially records 10\(^3\) counts per minute. The experiment is performed 28 days later, and the task is to determine the new counting rate.

P\(^{32}\) has a half-life of 14 days, so 28 days represents exactly two half-lives. Each half-life halves the number of radioactive atoms present, and since the counting rate is proportional to the number of decays (and thus to the activity), the counting rate will also be halved each half-life.

Starting with an initial counting rate of 10\(^3\) counts per minute, after one half-life (14 days), the counting rate decreases to 10\(^3\) / 2 = 500 counts per minute. After the second half-life (28 days), the counting rate decreases further to 500 / 2 = 250 counts per minute.

Since the problem does not mention changes in the quantum efficiency of the Geiger-Muller tube, we assume it remains at 100%, so the counting rate directly reflects the activity. Therefore, after 28 days, the new counting rate is 250 counts per minute.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: 750 counts/min**  
**D: 250 counts/min**

The correct answer is **D: 250 counts/min**.
