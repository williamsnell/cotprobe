Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Huemer's arguments regarding the harms of drug use. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I need to think carefully. Let me break down the question and the options.

The question is asking what Huemer argues about the harms of drug use. The options are A, B, C, and D. D is "All of the above," so it's possible that all the other options are correct, but I'll check each one first.

Option A says, "More harmful on average than legally permitted harmful activities." I remember that Huemer has written about the societal impact of drug use. He might be pointing out that drugs are more harmful on average compared to what's legally allowed. For example, if you compare the average harm of drug use to the harm of specific, legally permitted harmful activities, drugs might be more harmful in general. That makes sense because drugs can have long-term effects on individuals and communities.

Option B states, "Differing from the harms of other legally permitted harmful activities." Hmm, so Huemer is not just comparing drugs to other harmful activities but also emphasizing that they differ in their impact. Maybe he's saying that drugs have unique or more significant differences compared to others. I'm not as sure about this one. I might need to recall if Huemer has a point here. I think he might be making a distinction between specific harmful activities and the broader societal impact of drug use. So this could be a correct statement.

Option C claims, "More detrimental to a person's character than otherslegally permitted harmful activities." This seems like a strong statement. It's about the personal impact on a person's character. I believe Huemer might have argued that drugs have a more personal and lasting effect on individuals, making them detrimental to one's character. For example, the long-term consequences, societal effects, or personal trauma from drug use. So this option sounds plausible.

Option D is "All of the above." Since I'm thinking all these options are correct, D would be the choice.

Now, I need to think about each option's validity. 

Starting with A: I've read that Huemer argues that drug use is more harmful on average than other harmful activities that are legally permitted. For instance, the societal harm of drug use is greater than the harm of specific, legally allowed harmful actions. That makes sense because drugs can have broader, more lasting effects than just individual specific incidents.

Option B: I'm not as certain. Maybe Huemer isn't just comparing different activities but highlighting that drugs have a different kind of harm, perhaps more unique or significant compared to others. It's possible that this is a correct statement, but I'm not 100% sure. But I think A and C might both hold.

Option C: This seems like a strong statement. Huemer might emphasize that drugs have a more personal and long-lasting impact, making them detrimental to a person's character. For example, the emotional impact, the trauma, the societal impact, etc. So, this statement is probably true.

Putting it all together, the question is asking what Huemer argues. If all three statements (A, B, C) are correct, then D would be the answer. But I'm not 100% certain about B. Maybe B is a more nuanced or accurate statement compared to A. Alternatively, maybe only A and C are correct, making D the answer if all are correct.

Wait, the question states that Huemer argues that there is no reason to think the harms are important. So he's making a general statement that drug use is more harmful than other harmful activities. So if all the options are making that same point, then D would be correct.

So the answer should be D: All of the above.
</think>

The correct answer is D: All of the above.

**Explanation:**
Huemer argues that drug use is more harmful on average (A), differs from other harmful activities (B), and is more detrimental to a person's character (C). All these points support the idea that drug use has a significant and lasting impact, making D the correct choice.

Answer: D
