Okay, so I've got this problem here about a function T that takes two integers and maps them to another integer. The problem says T: Z x Z -> Z, which I think means that T takes two arguments from the set of integers and returns an integer. The specific details given are T(1, 0) = 3 and T(0, 1) = -5. I need to find T(-3, 2).

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that when a function is defined on pairs like this, it can often be represented as a linear combination. Maybe something like T(a, b) = ma + nb, where m and n are constants. Let me test this idea.

If I assume T(a, b) = m*a + n*b, then plugging in the given values should help find m and n. 

So, when a is 1 and b is 0, T(1,0) = m*1 + n*0 = m. But this is given as 3, so m must be 3.

Similarly, when a is 0 and b is 1, T(0,1) = m*0 + n*1 = n. This is given as -5, so n is -5.

Now, the function T(a,b) can be written as T(a,b) = 3a -5b.

Now, I need to compute T(-3, 2). Let's plug in a = -3 and b = 2.

So, T(-3, 2) = 3*(-3) + (-5)*2.

Calculating that: 3*(-3) is -9, and (-5)*2 is -10. Adding those together: -9 + (-10) = -19.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 3*(-3) is indeed -9. Then, -5*2 is -10. Adding them gives -19. So the result should be -19.

Looking at the options, option I is -19. So the correct answer should be I.

The function T is linear, so T(a, b) = 3a - 5b. Plugging in T(-3, 2) gives 3*(-3) -5*(2) = -9 -10 = -19. The answer is I.

Answer: I
