Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: ∫ from 0 to π/2 of 1/(1 + (tan x)^√2) dx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on integrals, but let's think this through.

Wait, I remember something about substitution. Maybe I can use a substitution to simplify this. Let me try a substitution where u = π/2 - x. Because when x approaches 0, u approaches π/2, and when x approaches π/2, u approaches 0. So, that would just reverse the limits but not change the integral's value. Let me write that down.

Let u = π/2 - x. Then, du = -dx. So, the integral becomes ∫ from π/2 to 0 of 1/(1 + (tan(π/2 - u))^√2) * (-du). The negative sign flips the limits back to 0 to π/2, so it's the same as ∫ from 0 to π/2 of 1/(1 + (tan(π/2 - u))^√2) du.

But I also know that tan(π/2 - u) is cot u. So, substituting that in, the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to π/2 of 1/(1 + (cot u)^√2) du. 

Hmm, what's (cot u)^√2? Well, cot u is 1/tan u, so (cot u)^√2 is (1/tan u)^√2, which is (tan u)^(-√2). So, the integral now is ∫ [1/(1 + (tan u)^(-√2))] du from 0 to π/2.

Wait, 1/(1 + (tan u)^(-√2)) can be rewritten. Let me see. Let's factor out (tan u)^(-√2) from the denominator: (tan u)^(-√2) [1 + (tan u)^(√2)]. So, 1/(1 + (tan u)^(-√2)) equals (tan u)^√2 / [1 + (tan u)^√2]. Because multiplying numerator and denominator by (tan u)^√2 gives [1 * (tan u)^√2] / [ (tan u)^(-√2) * (tan u)^√2 + 1*(tan u)^√2 ) ] which simplifies to (tan u)^√2 / [1 + (tan u)^√2].

Wait, so the integral becomes ∫ [ (tan u)^√2 / (1 + (tan u)^√2) ] du from 0 to π/2, which is the same as the original integral. Because the original integral is ∫ [1/(1 + (tan x)^√2)] dx, and now we're writing it in terms of u, which is the same variable. So, this substitution doesn't seem to change the integral. Hmm, that's odd. Did I do something wrong?

Wait another approach: Let me consider the original integral I = ∫ from 0 to π/2 [1/(1 + (tan x)^√2)] dx. Let me also consider the substitution x = π/2 - t. Then, when x=0, t=π/2, and when x=π/2, t=0. So, the integral becomes ∫ from π/2 to 0 [1/(1 + (tan(π/2 - t))^√2)] (-dt). The negative flips the limits, so it's ∫ from 0 to π/2 [1/(1 + (tan(π/2 - t))^√2)] dt. But tan(π/2 - t) is cot t, so it's ∫ [1/(1 + (cot t)^√2)] dt.

Wait, but wait. Let's express (cot t)^√2 as (1/tan t)^√2 = (tan t)^(-√2). So, again, the integral becomes ∫ [1/(1 + (tan t)^(-√2))] dt from 0 to π/2. Let me compute this expression.

Let me denote A = ∫ [1/(1 + (tan t)^(-√2))] dt. Let me rewrite this. It's the same as ∫ [ (tan t)^√2 / (1 + (tan t)^√2) ) ] dt. So, A = ∫ [ (tan t)^√2 / (1 + (tan t)^√2) ) ] dt.

Wait, but this is similar to the original integral, which is I = ∫ [1/(1 + (tan t)^√2)] dt. So, I = A, but A is different. Let me think: is there a relation between I and A?

Wait, if I add I and A, what do I get?

I + A = ∫ [1/(1 + (tan t)^√2) + (tan t)^√2/(1 + (tan t)^√2) ] dt = ∫ [ (1 + (tan t)^√2 ) / (1 + (tan t)^√2) ] dt = ∫ 1 dt from 0 to π/2. So, I + A = π/2.

But since I = A, because substitution didn't change the integral, then I = A = (π/2)/2 = π/4 ≈ 0.7853981634. Wait, but that's one of the options. Looking back, option F is 0.78539815, which is π/4. So, is the answer F?

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the substitution. Did I do it right? Because sometimes substitutions can be tricky.

Alternatively, another approach: Let me consider that for any function f(x), ∫[0 to π/2] f(tan x) dx can sometimes be evaluated by substitution. Wait, in this case, the integrand is 1/(1 + (tan x)^√2). Hmm. Let me let u = tan x, so that du = sec²x dx, and dx = du/(1 + u²). When x=0, u=0; when x=π/2, u approaches infinity. So, the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to ∞ [1/(1 + u^√2) ] * [ du/(1 + u²) ].

Wait, that's another integral. But I don't know if that helps directly. Alternatively, perhaps using a symmetry or another substitution.

Wait, but perhaps there's a trick here. Let's think about the function f(x) = 1/(1 + (tan x)^√2). I wonder if there's a symmetry when x is replaced by π/2 - x, which we already did earlier, but perhaps the integral can be evaluated as the average of f(x) and f(π/2 - x), but I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the substitution approach: when we substitute u = π/2 - x, and found that the integral I equals A, which is the same as I. So I = A, and I + A = π/2. So, 2I = π/2 ⇒ I = π/4. So, the value of the integral is π/4, which is approximately 0.7853981634. So option F is correct.

The integral $\int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1}{1+(\tan x)^{\sqrt{2}}} dx$ can be evaluated by using the substitution $u = \pi/2 - x$. This substitution leads to the realization that the integral is symmetric, meaning it equals its own transformation under this substitution. By adding the original integral and its transformed version, the integral simplifies to $\pi/2$, which when divided by 2 gives the value of $\pi/4$. This is approximately 0.7853981634, corresponding to option F.

Answer: F
