Okay, let's see. I've got this question here: "What is the square root of 81 squared?" Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. 

So, first, I should break it down. The question is asking for the square root of 81 squared. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me write it down to visualize it better. It's like √(81²). Or maybe it's written as (81²)^(1/2), right? Because square root is the same as raising to the power of 1/2.

Wait, but remember the order of operations. Exponents are handled before square roots, or is it the other way around? No, exponentiation comes before roots, but wait, actually it's the opposite. Wait no, square roots are the same as raising to the 1/2 power, so maybe it's (81²)^(1/2).

Alternatively, maybe I can simplify this expression. Let's think about the properties of exponents. When you have (a^m)^n, it's equal to a^(m*n). So, (81²)^(1/2) would be 81^(2*(1/2)) which is 81^1, which is just 81. So the square root of 81 squared is 81. 

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's think about what 81 squared is. 81 squared is 81 multiplied by itself. 81*81 is 6561, right? So that's 81² = 6561. Now, what's the square root of 6561? The square root is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 6561. Let's think: 81 times 81 is 6561, so the square root is 81. So that's correct. 

Wait, but I also remember that the square root of a square is the absolute value of the original number. Because square and square root are inverse operations, but since square roots are defined as positive numbers, the square root of 81² is 81, not -81. So, yeah, that fits with what I just calculated.

Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: 9² → 81
B: 27 → 27 is 3^3, but 81² is 6561, whose square root is 81, so B is 27, not 81.
C: 81² → 6561, which is the square of 81, but we're taking square root of that, so it's 81.
D: 729 → 9^3 is 729, but again, that's not 81.
E: 6561 → that's 81 squared, which is the number we're taking the square root of, so E is the square, not the square root.
F: 12 → 12 squared is 144, not 6561.
G: 162 → 162 squared is way larger than 6561.
H: 243 → 243 squared is 59049, not 6561.
I: 81 → That's exactly what I found earlier, so I is correct.
J: 9 → 9 squared is 81, but that's not the square root of 81 squared.

So the correct answer is I: 81. But wait, looking back, I'm seeing option I is 81. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 9² =81
B:27 → no
C:81² is 6561, but that's the square of 81, not the square root.
D:729 → 9³ is 729, but that's not 81.
E:6561 → square of 81.
F:12 → no
G:162 → no
H:243 → no
I:81 → yes, correct
J:9 → 9² is 81, not 6561.

So the answer is I:81.
