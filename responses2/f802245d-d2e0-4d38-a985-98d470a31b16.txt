Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Inuit and their origins. Hmm. Let me think through this.

The question is asking which people are the modern Inuit descendants of. The options are A to J, each representing a different group.

I remember that Inuit people are a indigenous group from northern Canada. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on their exact origins. So, looking at the options:

A: Mi'kmaq – I think that's more related to the Inuit language and the Inuit language itself, not their actual origins.
B: Norse – No, the Norse are from Scandinavia, not directly related to the Inuit.
C: Beothuk – Beothuk is another language group, maybe related to the Inuit, but I'm not sure.
D: Dorset – Dorset is a language, not directly the Inuit people.
E: Nootka – Oh, I think that's correct. The Nootka culture is the modern Inuit people. They came from the Betrack region of what's now Alaska.
F: Clovis – Clovis is another indigenous group from Canada, but not part of the Inuit.
G: Tuniit – I'm not sure about this one. Maybe a different language group.
H: Vinland – That's Swedish, not related to the Inuit.
I: Paleo-Eskimos – These are ancient, pre-Columbian groups. No, Inuit aren't from that time.
J: Thule – Thule is a different group, maybe from the Arctic.

So, putting it together, the modern Inuit are descendants of the Nootka. So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: Nootka.
