Question:

An orange grove and a vineyard are adjoining tracts of land located in a county. In 2006, a farmer purchased the orange grove, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The vineyard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the orange grove, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the vineyard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $200,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher farmer deed nor the farmer  investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the orange grove. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that the orange grove abuts a public highway. The only access to that public highway for the vineyard is across the orange grove. If the investor initiates an appropriate action to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove, she should

Options:

A: prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.
B: prevail, because the farmer was aware of the easement when he purchased the vineyard.
C: not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.
D: prevail, because the vineyard has no other access to the public highway.
E: not prevail, because the easement was never actually used by the shepherd.
F: prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.
G: prevail, because the right-of-way was granted by a remote predecessor and not the farmer.
H: not prevail, because the farmer has the right to revoke the easement at any time.
I: not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.
J: not prevail, because the right-of-way was not included in the farmer-investor deed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about easements and right-of-way. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there are two tracts of land: an orange grove and a vineyard. The orange grove is 10 acres, and the vineyard is 20 acres to the north. The farmer bought the orange grove in 2006 for fee simple absolute, meaning no rights attached at the time of purchase. But there was a predecessor who gave the farmer a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove. Since it's a way for egress and ingress, it must be an easement appurtenant. So, the easement can be used as a way to enter or exit the property.

Now, the easement was created by a previous owner, not the farmer. The right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The problem is that the farmer never used the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher (the original owner of the vineyard) sold it to the farmer. Then, in 2011, the farmer sold the vineyard to an investor for consideration. Neither the farmer nor the investor deed mentioned the easement. The investor now thinks she has a right of way to use the orange grove, but the farmer says there's no easement.

So, the question is whether the investor can prevail in claiming her right. The options are A to J.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A says the right-of-way remains in effect unless explicitly released. I remember that easements are generally considered to be enforceable until they are released. But in this case, the easement was created by a remote predecessor (the original owner), so it's not created by the current owner. But the question is about whether the easement affects the current owner (the farmer). I think the easement is still effective because it's an easement appurtenant. So the right of way is still in effect, so the farmer's claim would stand unless the easement is extinguished by something.

But wait, the question is about the right-of-way being used by the farmer and the investor not having any reference. The question is whether the investor can claim it. The options mention various reasons, like the easement was created by the farmer, whether it's recorded, whether the farmer used it, etc.

Option C says the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the vineyard. Wait, merger would be when two parties combine their estates. The problem here is that the owner of the orange grove is the farmer. Before that, the owner was the previous person who granted the way. So, if the farmer never used the way, then when he acquired the grove, the easement might have been separate. But I'm not sure how merger applies here. Merger would require a merger of estates, which is different from the right-of-way being used by the farmer. So, perhaps the easement isn't related to merger. So, option C might not apply here.

Option F suggests the easement arose by implication from the farmer's conveyance. But the way for egress is created by a way for ingress. The previous owner granted the way for ingress, which is an easement appurtenant. The right-of-way is the exit way, so maybe it's an implied easement? Wait, the way for egress is typically an implied easement, but in this case, the way was created by the predecessor, so it's an easement appurtenant. So, the right-of-way is an easement appurtenant, so it's not an implied easement. Therefore, the implication argument (Option F) might not hold. So, Option F is incorrect.

Option D says the vines have no other access to the highway. The problem states that the only access is across the orange grove. So, the right-of-way is the only way. Hence, the easement is the only way to cross into the vineyard. So, the right of way is the only way, meaning the easement is valid. So, the farmer's claim may stand. But wait, the question is about whether the right-of-way is used, but the issue is if the easement is in place.

Wait, but the question is whether the right-of-way is in the farmer's possession. If the farmer has a way for ingress (the right-of-way to enter the grove), then when the farmer acquired the vineyard, he would have the right to use it. So, if the farmer had the right-of-way, he would have the right to use it. But the farmer never used it, but the question is whether the investor can claim it. The farmer informed the investor that there's no easement. So, the farmer might have a right of way. But the question is whether the investor can claim it. The issue is whether the farmer is entitled to the right.

In this case, the basis is that if the farmer had the right of way, he would have the right to use it. So, the farmer must have the right as a party. The problem is whether the farmer has the right to use the right-of-way. But the issue here is whether the farmer has the right to use it. So, the farmer's right would depend on whether he had the right at the time of the sale. The question is whether the farmer had the right of way.

Wait, no, the problem says the right-of-way was created by the previous owner, so the farmer didn't have it. So, if the farmer had the right of way, that would mean he had the right to use it. But the question is about whether the farmer's ownership of the right-of-way would allow him to use it. However, the farmer never used it, but perhaps he had the right to use it. So, the question is whether the farmer has the right to use it.

Wait, but the question is about the investor's right. The farmer claims there's no easement. But in fact, the farmer did have the right of way, so he should have the right to use it. But the question is whether the investor can claim that she has a right. The options are about whether the farmer's claim would prevail. The options include whether the right is in the farmer's possession.

So, let's think about the options again. The question is whether the investor can claim she has a right of way across the orange grove.

The options are:

A: prevail, because the easement remains in effect until explicitly released.

B: because the farmer was aware of the easement.

C: not, because merger.

D: because the right-of-way is the only access.

E: not, because the deed didn't mention the easement.

F: because it's implied.

G: because it's an easement appurtenant.

H: the easement was never used, so not released.

I: the deed didn't mention the right.

J: the right wasn't included in the deed.

So, the key is whether the easement is valid.

In the case of easements appurtenant, the easement is valid unless it's been extinguished by a subsequent use. If the easement is created by a prior owner and the present owner never used it, then the easement remains in effect.

In this case, the previous owner (the predecessor) granted the easement appurtenant. The farmer never used it. So, the easement is still valid. Therefore, the farmer would have the right to use it, meaning the farmer's claim would stand unless the right-of-way is not in the farmer's possession.

But the question is, can the investor claim she has a right. The farmer informed the investor that there's no easement. So, the farmer claims no easement exists, which would mean the investor's claim is based on the absence of an easement.

Wait, but the farmer had the right to use it, so the farmer would have the right, so the investor can't prevail because the farmer is entitled to use it.

Wait, but the question is whether the right-of-way is in the farmer's possession. Because the right-of-way is the way to enter the grove, the farmer must have the right to use it. If the farmer had the right, he can use it. But the question is whether the right-of-way is in the farmer's possession, which it is, so he can claim it.

Wait, no, the question is whether the right-of-way is in the farmer's possession, but the investor is claiming she has the right. So, the farmer's claim is that the right is in his possession, which it is. So, the investor can't claim that she has a right because she doesn't have it. She might have the right, but if the farmer had it, she can't claim it because the farmer is acting as the possessor.

Wait, but the question is what the investor can do. The question is whether the investor can claim she has the right. So, the options are about whether the farmer has the right to use the right-of-way. Since the farmer doesn't have it, she can't claim it. So, the farmer's claim is that the right is not in his possession, and thus the investor cannot claim it.

Wait, but the question is whether the investor can claim. The options are about the outcome. So, the options state whether the investor can prevail.

Looking at the options, I think the correct reasoning is that the easement is valid, so the farmer has the right to use it, which means the farmer's claim would be that the right is in his possession. But the farmer says there's no easement, so the investor can't claim. Thus, the farmer's claim would be that the right is not in his possession, and the investor can't claim.

Wait, but let's get back to the options. The question is, the investor can claim she has a right. The options are whether the right is in her possession.

Wait, the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession. So, the options are:

A: the easement remains in effect until released.

B: the farmer knew about the easement.

C: not because of merger.

D: because there's no other access.

E: because the deed didn't mention.

F: because it's implied.

G: because it's easement appurtenant.

H: easement released.

I: the deed didn't mention.

J: the right wasn't in the deed.

So, the correct reasoning is that the easement is valid because it was created by a remote predecessor, and the farmer has the right to use it. Thus, the farmer's claim would be that the right is in his possession, so the investor can't claim. But the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession, not about whether the farmer can use it.

Wait, but the question is whether the investor can claim as having a right. So, if the farmer has the right, she can't claim it. But the options may not be about that. Wait, the options present possible outcomes.

Wait, the options are:

A: prevail, because the easement remains in effect.

So, if the easement is valid, then the farmer has the right to use it. Thus, the farmer's claim would be that the right is in his possession, so the investor can't claim. But the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession to claim. So, if the option is whether the right is in the farmer's possession, then the correct outcome is that the right is in his possession, so the farmer's claim would be that the right is not in his possession. Wait, no, the question is whether the right is in the farmer's possession. The options are about whether the right was properly recorded, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the legal implications.

In the case where an easement appurtenant is created by a remote predecessor, the easement remains valid. So, the farmer has the right to use the right-of-way, which is the right to enter the grove. But the question is whether the right is in the farmer's possession, which it is.

So, the farmer's claim would be that the right is not in his possession. But the options don't directly address that. The options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession to claim.

Wait, the question is whether the investor can claim she has a right. The farmer says no easement. So, the farmer's claim is that the right is in his possession. The options are about whether the right is in his possession.

Wait, the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession to claim, not whether the right is valid. So, the options are about whether the right is in his possession, not about the validity of the right.

So, the correct reasoning is that the easement is valid because it was created by a remote predecessor, so the farmer has the right to use it. Thus, the farmer can claim that the right is in his possession, so the investor's claim would fail because the farmer is the possessor.

Wait, but the options aren't addressing that. Instead, the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession. So, the correct outcome is that the farmer has the right. So the option that would say the right is in his possession is G, which states that the right was created by the predecessor, not the farmer.

Wait, looking back: The options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession.

So, in the options, which option is correct? The correct reasoning is that the easement is valid, so the farmer has the right. So, the farmer's claim that the right is not in his possession would be wrong. Therefore, the investor can't prevail because the farmer has the right.

But the options are about the outcome. So, the correct outcome is that the right is in the farmer's possession, so the farmer's claim would be that the right is not in his possession, so the investor can't claim. But the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the possible outcomes.

The answer options are about whether the investor can prevail. The correct answer is that the right is valid, so the farmer has the right. So, the farmer's claim would be that the right is not in his possession, and thus the investor can't claim.

But the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession. So, if the farmer has the right, the correct outcome is that the right is in his possession, so the farmer's claim would be that the right is not in his possession. But the options don't directly address that. They address whether the right was in the farmer's possession.

Wait, the options are:

A: Prevail, easement remains until released.

B: Prevail, farmer knew about it.

C: Not prevail, merger.

D: Prevail, no other access.

E: Not prevail, no mention in deed.

F: Prevail, implied easement.

G: Prevail, easement appurtenant.

H: Not prevail, release.

I: Not prevail, deed didn't mention.

J: Not prevail, right not in deed.

So, the correct reasoning is that the easement is valid because created by a remote predecessor, so the farmer has the right. So, the farmer's claim that the right is not in his possession would be wrong. But the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession.

Thus, the correct answer is G: Prevail, because the easement was created by a remote predecessor and not the farmer.

Wait, but the question is whether the right is in the farmer's possession. So, the right is in the farmer's possession, so the farmer can use it. So, the farmer's claim would be that the right is in his possession, so the investor can't claim it.

Wait, but the options are about whether the right is in the farmer's possession. The correct reasoning is that the easement is valid, so the farmer has the right. So, the farmer's claim is that the right is not in his possession. But the options don't directly address that; they address whether the right is in the farmer's possession.

So, the correct outcome is that the right is in the farmer's possession, so the investor can't claim it. Therefore, the investor cannot prevail because the farmer has the right, so the farmer's claim is that the right is not in his possession. But the options are about whether the right was in the farmer's possession.

Wait, perhaps the right is in the farmer's possession, so the farmer's claim is that the right is not in his possession, which would be correct. But the options are about whether the investor can prevail.

So, the correct answer is G: Prevail, because the easement was created by a remote predecessor and not the farmer.

Because the farmer has the right to use it, the investor cannot claim. So, the answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the right is in the farmer's possession, so the investor can't claim it. Thus, the answer is G.

Wait, in the options, G is correct.

So, the answer is G.
</think>

The correct answer is **G: Prevail, because the easement was created by a remote predecessor and not the farmer.**

**Explanation:**

The key issue revolves around the validity of the easement created by a remote predecessor. According to common law, easements created by a remote predecessor remain valid unless they are extinguished by subsequent use. In this case, the right-of-way was created by a remote predecessor and was never used by the farmer. Therefore, the easement remains in effect, and the farmer has the right to use it. The investor, who has the right to use the right-of-way, cannot prevail because the farmer is the possessor of the right-of-way.
