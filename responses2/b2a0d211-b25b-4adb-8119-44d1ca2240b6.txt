Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question to tackle. Let's read it carefully.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. Then, there are four options (A to J) which are combinations of True/False and possibly whether each is true or false.

First, let's break down each statement.

Statement 1: PCA and Spectral Clustering, like Andrew Ng’s, perform eigendecomposition on two different matrices. Both have the same size.

Hmm. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique. I remember that PCA involves computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Wait, yes, for PCA, you compute the eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is of the data matrix, so it's N x N, where N is the number of samples. So PCA uses the covariance matrix.

On the other hand, Spectral Clustering, especially the ones that use spectral methods like in Andrew Ng's work, do eigendecomposition of a similarity matrix. Oh, right, the similarity matrix is constructed based on the data points. For example, if you have a similarity matrix S, you compute its eigen decomposition. But wait, the size of the similarity matrix S is the same as the data matrix D. Because S is N x N if D is N x N. So both PCA and Spectral Clustering use eigendecomposition on matrices of the same size. So Statement 1 seems to be true.

Statement 2: Since classification is a special case of regression, logistic regression is a special case of linear regression.

Wait, classification is a special case of regression. For example, binary classification can be seen as a regression problem where the output is either 0 or 1. But the models themselves are different. Classification models (like logistic regression) are used for predicting discrete labels, whereas linear regression is for predicting continuous outputs. So, is logistic regression a special case of linear regression?

Wait, the statement says, "logistic regression is a special case of linear regression." But that's not correct. Because linear regression models predict a continuous variable, and logistic regression is for a binary outcome. So they are different models. So Statement 2 is false.

So now, evaluating the options:

Options are combinations of the statements. The options are labeled A to J, but the options themselves are combinations of whether each statement is true or not.

Wait, the options are A to J, each being a possible combination of two statements. Let me see the options:

A: Neither true nor false, Neither true nor false → Both statements are neither T nor F in this context? Probably not, as the options are about whether each statement is true or false, but the options as a whole are about the statements.

Wait, no, the options are labeled A to J, each being a combination of two statements. Wait, no, looking again: the user says "Each option (A to J) is a combination of whether each statement is true or false, with the last character being the letter."

Wait, no, that's not how the options are presented. Let me re-read the question.

The options are:

A: Neither true nor false, Neither true nor false

B: False, Neither true nor false

C: True, False, Neither true nor false

Wait, no, I think I misread. Let me go back.

Looking back, the options are presented as:

A: Neither true nor false, Neither true nor false

B: False, Neither true nor false

C: True, False, Neither true nor false

D: False, True

E: True, Neither true nor false

F: Neither true nor false, True

G: True, True

H: False, False

I: True, False

J: Neither true nor false, False

Wait, no. No, I think each option is a combination of the two statements.

Wait, no, perhaps the options are pairs. For example, for the statements, we need to determine if statement 1 is true (T) or false (F), and same for statement 2 (T or F).

Then the answer options are combinations of these two, so each answer option has two parts, each part indicating whether the statement is T or F.

So, the first part of option A is "Neither true nor false" because both statements are neither T nor F. But that can't be right; because the options are pairs of statements' truth values.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Each option is a combination of whether each statement is true or false. So, for example, option A is "Neither true nor false, Neither true nor false"—that doesn't make much sense, but perhaps it's meant to represent that both statements are neither T nor F, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the options are pairs of the two statements' truth values.

Wait, the question says: "Statement 1| ... Statement 2| ... The answer options are...".

Wait, looking again, the statements are given, and the answer options are combinations of the two statements' truth values.

So the answer options are, for example, option A says "Statement 1 is neither T nor F, Statement 2 is neither T nor F"—but this is impossible because each is T or F.

Wait, perhaps the answer options are pairs of whether each is true or false. Like, for example, option A is "Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is neither T nor F"—but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps each option is a possible combination of the two statements' truth values. For example:

Option A: Statement 1 is neither T nor F, Statement 2 is neither T nor F → this is impossible because each statement can't be neither T nor F.

Similarly, option B: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is neither T nor F.

But that doesn't make sense because each statement must be T or F.

Wait, perhaps each option is a pair of truth values for the two statements. For example:

Option A: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.

Option B: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true.

Option C: Both are true.

Option D: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false.

Option E: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true.

And so on. So the answer options are each a possible combination of the two statements being T or F.

Wait, perhaps the options are pairs of whether each statement is true or false. So for each answer option, the first part is the evaluation of Statement 1, the second is Statement 2.

So, for example, option A is: "Statement 1 is neither true nor false, Statement 2 is neither true nor false" → but that's impossible because each can't be neither. But the options are presented as A to J, with each being a possible pair.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are given is that each option is a pair of two truth values, but the answer options are a letter that represents their combination.

Wait, perhaps the answer options are: each option is a pair of two letters (e.g., option A is "Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false"), but that doesn't fit the structure.

Wait, perhaps each option is a pair of two truth values, such as (T, F), (F, T), (T, T), (F, F). So, for example, option A is (T, T), option B is (F, T), etc.

So the answer options are labeled A to J, each is a possible combination of the two statements' truth values.

So, let's reevaluate the statements:

Statement 1: PCA and Spectral Clustering, like Andrew Ng’s, perform eigendecomposition on two different matrices. Both have the same size.

As I concluded earlier, both PCA and Spectral Clustering (as in Ng's) perform eigendecomposition on eigenvectors. PCA uses the covariance matrix of the data, which is N x N (assuming N samples). Spectral Clustering, like Ng's approach, uses a similarity matrix, which is also N x N. So both use eigendecomposition on matrices of the same size. So Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: Since classification is a special case of regression, logistic regression is a special case of linear regression.

Wait, classification and regression are different. For example, in classification, the output is categorical (e.g., 0/1), while in regression, it's continuous. So the models themselves are different. So Statement 2 is false.

So, Statement 1 is T, Statement 2 is F.

Looking at the options:

Looking for a pair where the first is T and the second is F.

Looking at the options:

A: Neither, Neither → No.

B: F, Neither → First is F, second is neither. So no.

C: T, F → Yes. Option C is "True, False".

D: F, T → No.

E: T, Neither → No.

F: Neither, T → No.

G: T, T → No.

H: F, F → No.

I: T, F → Yes. So options C and I are both T, F.

Wait, but wait, in the options, option I is "True, False".

Looking back at the options:

Options are:

A: Neither, Neither → So both statements are neither.

B: False, Neither → Statement 1 is F, Statement 2 is neither.

C: True, False → Statement 1 is T, Statement 2 is F.

D: False, True → Statement 1 is F, Statement 2 is T.

E: True, Neither → Statement 1 is T, Statement 2 is neither.

F: Neither, True → Statement 1 is neither, Statement 2 is T.

G: True, True → Both are T.

H: False, False → Both are F.

I: True, False → Both statements evaluated.

J: Neither, False → Statement 1 is neither, Statement 2 is F.

So, Statement 1 is T, Statement 2 is F. So looking for a pair in the options that is (T, F). Looking through the options:

Option C is (True, False).

Option I is (True, False) as well.

Wait, no. Wait, I thought Statement 1 is T and Statement 2 is F.

Looking at the options:

A: Neither, Neither → no.

B: F, Neither → no.

C: T, F → yes.

D: F, T → no.

E: T, Neither → no.

F: Neither, T → no.

G: T, T → no.

H: F, F → no.

I: T, F → yes.

J: Neither, F → no.

So both options C and I have T and F. So the answer would have both statements true and false, but the options have two options (C and I) that fit.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are presented as each being a possible pair. So each option is a pair, and the correct answer would have the pair (T, F). Looking at the options, both C and I have T and F. So why are there two options with the same pair? But in the given options, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, checking the options again:

Looking for the correct pair.

Statement 1: T.

Statement 2: F.

So the correct option would be one that has T and F.

Looking at the options:

C: True, False → yes.

I: True, False → yes.

Wait, but options C and I have the same pair. So perhaps the correct answer is C or I. But wait, in the options, only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the statements.

Statement 1: Are PCA and Spectral Clustering performing eigendecomposition on two different matrices of the same size? Since both PCA and Spectral Clustering (as in Ng's) do eigendecomposition using their respective matrices. So the size is same. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: Classification is a special case of regression. No, because regression is predicting continuous variables, while classification is categorical. So Statement 2 is False.

So the correct pair is (True, False). So looking at the options, both options C and I are (True, False). But wait, no, looking again:

Looking at the options list:

C: True, False → Yes.

I: True, False → Yes.

Wait, but the user's question's options are labeled A through J, each a pair. So perhaps the correct answer is either C or I. But in the given options, the answer options are the letters, so each answer option is a single letter. So if both C and I are correct, but that's impossible because the options are labeled as letters, and each answer can only be one option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Statement 2.

Wait, Statement 2: Since classification is a special case of regression, logistic regression is a special case of linear regression.

Is that correct? Well, classification is a special case of regression, in the sense that for binary classification, you can model it as a regression problem where the output is binary. But the models themselves are different. So, for example, logistic regression is a model that predicts probabilities (between 0 and 1), whereas linear regression is for predicting a real number. So does that make logistic regression a special case of linear regression? Not exactly, because the outputs are different.

So Statement 2 is false.

Thus, the correct pair is (True, False). Now, looking at the answer options:

Option C is True, False.

Option I is also True, False.

Wait, but the way the options are presented, each option is a two-part letter. So, for example, option C is (True, False). So both C and I have that pair.

Wait, that doesn't seem possible. The options are labeled A to J, each a single letter, but the pair options would have multiple letters? No, each answer option is a single letter. So, perhaps I'm misreading the options.

Wait, let me re-express the options. Each option is a possible pair of statements' truth values. So the options are A to J, each being a possible combination like:

A: Statement 1 is neither, Statement 2 is neither.

B: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is neither.

C: Both are true.

D: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true.

E: Both are true.

F: Statement 1 is neither, Statement 2 is true.

G: Both are true.

H: Both are false.

I: Both are true.

J: Statement 1 is neither, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the options.

Wait, perhaps the options are pairs of truth values for the two statements.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each being a single possible combination.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A: Neither true nor false, Neither true nor false

B: False, Neither true nor false

C: True, False

D: False, True

E: True, Neither

F: Neither, True

G: True, True

H: False, False

I: True, False

J: Neither, False

Wait, no, that can't be. Because each option is a single pair of truth values, not a pair of two letters.

Wait, perhaps the options are presented as pairs, each being a possible combination. So, for example, option A is "Statement 1 is neither, Statement 2 is neither", option B is "Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is neither", etc. But that would make the options a bit more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented as a choice between A to J, which each is a possible combination of two statements' truth values.

Wait, perhaps the options are given as:

Each answer is a two-part letter, each part indicating the truth value of the two statements.

For example, option C is "True, False".

So, the correct pair is (True, False), which would be option C or I.

Wait, but the options given don't have any other (True, False) except C and I.

But looking back, the options are labeled as A to J, each a single letter. So, for each possible pair, which of the options (A to J) is the correct pair.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled here, but the correct evaluation is that Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. So the correct pair is (T, F). Among the options, both C and I are (T, F). But this can't be, as each option is a single letter. Therefore, perhaps the options are different. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options again:

A: Neither, Neither → No.

B: False, Neither → Statement 1 is F, which is correct, but Statement 2 is neither, which is wrong.

C: True, False → correct.

D: False, True → Statement 1 is F, Statement 2 is T → incorrect.

E: True, Neither → Statement 1 is T, Statement 2 is neither → incorrect.

F: Neither, True → Statement 1 is neither, Statement 2 is T → incorrect.

G: True, True → Both are T → incorrect.

H: False, False → Both are F → incorrect.

I: True, False → Correct.

J: Neither, False → Statement 1 is neither, Statement 2 is F → incorrect.

So the options C and I are both correct. But that's impossible as the answer options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, but perhaps the options don't have a pair with both. Alternatively, perhaps the options are the only two letter options, and the user is indicating that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that both statements are true. But no, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, perhaps the options are labeled A to J, each with a single possible pair. So the correct pair is (True, False), which is option C or I.

But according to the options presented in the question, both C and I would be correct, but the options are given as A to J, each as a possible pair. Wait, perhaps the answer options are as follows:

Each option is a pair (A: (F,F), B: (F, neither), C: (T,F), D: (F,T), etc.)

So, the correct answer is option C, which says "Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false".

But in the given options, option C exists. So the correct answer would be option C, meaning that the pair (True, False) is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. The options are each a single possible pair. So, the options are:

A: Both are neither.

B: Statement 1 is F, Statement 2 is neither.

C: Both are T and F? No. No, each option is a pair of truth values.

Wait, perhaps the options are C and I, but the user's options list has only option C as (T,F). Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options.

Wait, looking back, I think the correct answer is that Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. So the option C is (T, F) and option I is (T, F). But in reality, the options are presented as a single letter, each representing the pair of truth values.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is "True, False".

So, the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The correct answer is option C, which states that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.

**Answer: C**
