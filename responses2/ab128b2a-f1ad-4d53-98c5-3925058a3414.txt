Okay, so I've got this question about psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember that cognitive dissonance is a concept in psychology, often discussed in the context of decision-making. The main idea is that people prefer things to be in harmony. If they find a belief or action that doesn't fit with their current beliefs or actions, they might feel discomfort or "dissonance." This is usually a bad thing, right? It can lead to a lot of stress and conflict.

Now, the question is about psychological inconsistency. The options are A to J, each giving a different explanation about how inconsistency affects the theory. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Psychological inconsistency increases the importance of consistent beliefs. Hmm, not sure. I thought inconsistency might lead to more conflict, not increasing consistency.

Option B: Inconsistent beliefs result in seeking external validation. That makes sense. If someone feels dissonant, they might look for reasons outside their own beliefs to justify their actions. Like, maybe they're feeling angry and want to get away from it, but they have a strong sense of their own beliefs.

Option C: Leads to equilibrium without change. Wait, equilibrium usually implies a balance. If inconsistency exists, maybe it leads to a state where they have to have both consistent and inconsistent elements. I don't think that's right. C doesn't seem to fit.

Option D: Inconsistent theories are irrelevant. No, inconsistency is a key part of cognitive dissonance. It's what leads to the discomfort.

Option E: Inconsistent beliefs are linked to mental illness. I don't think that's accurate. I remember that inconsistency can be normal, even in healthy people.

Option F: Inconsistent beliefs lead to more dissonance. That sounds opposite of what I know. Consistency reduces inconsistency.

Option G: Inconsistent beliefs are resolved by professional therapy. That's a common suggestion, but I'm not sure if it's the theory's primary role.

Option H: Inconsistent beliefs motivate ignoring the problem. That's a key point. People often ignore their inconsistency to seek validation.

Option I: Inconsistent beliefs are resolved by creating new attitudes. Yes, that's a common process, like when someone changes their behavior because they realize their inconsistent actions.

Option J: Inconsistent beliefs motivate changing the issue. Again, the same as H and I. They want to address the problem.

So, looking back at the question, the correct answer should explain that inconsistency leads to seeking external validation, which is option B. It's also connected to the idea that inconsistency is a problem that needs motivation to resolve.

Wait, but cognitive dissonance is about the feeling of inconsistency. So when someone feels their belief is dissonant, they might seek validation, which is what option B says. So the role of inconsistency is to justify it by seeking external validation. That's what the theory suggests.

So the correct answer is B.

The role of psychological inconsistency in the theory of cognitive dissonance is that it leads to the need for external validation to justify the dissonant beliefs or actions. This aligns with option B.

**Answer: B**
