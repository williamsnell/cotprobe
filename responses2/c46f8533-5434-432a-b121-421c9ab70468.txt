Okay, so I have this question about recording the maturity dates for several notes. Each note has a specific start date and a payment period. I need to figure out each one's maturity date.

Let me go through each part one by one.

Part (a): Draft dated November 12, payable 60 days after date. So, I need to add 60 days to November 12. Let's count the days. November has 30 days, so from November 12 to November 30 is 18 days (including both dates?) Wait, no. November 12 is day 0, so the next day is 13, up to November 30. That's 18 days. Then we have December, January, February, March.

Wait, 60 days total. Let me calculate:

November has 30 days, so 30 - 12 +1 = 19 days remaining in November. Then December has 31, January 31, February 28, March 31. Wait, but 60 days: Let's do it step by step.

From 12/12: 12/12 to 12/31 is 19 days. Then 12/31 to 1/31 is 30 days. Then 1/31 to 2/28 is 28 days. That's 19+30+28 =77 days, which is more than 60. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each month:

60 days starting from November 12.

November: 12 to 30 is 19 days (including both dates? Or not? Let me think: from 12/12 to 12/30 is 19 days. Because 30-12 +1 =19? No, 30-12=18, but 18+1=19. Wait, no: 12/12 is day 0, 12/13 is day 1, up to 12/30 is day 18. So 19 days (including both). Then December has 31 days, so 19 +31 =50, January has 31, so 50+31=81, which is over 60. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should count each month step by step. Let me see:

Start date: 12/12.

Add 60 days.

First, subtract the days in November after 12/12: November has 30 days. So days in November beyond 12/12: 30 -12 =18 days, but since 12/12 is the starting point, we count from 12/13 to 12/30. That's 18 days. So 18 days in November.

Remaining days: 60 -18=42.

December: 31 days, so 42-31=11 days left in December.

January: 31 days, so 11-31= -20. Wait, that's impossible. So we can't go into January yet. So the remaining 42 days after November are 31 (December) and 11 (January).

So let's add:

18 (November) +31 (December)=49. Remaining 11 days in January. So 12/12 +60 days is 1/21.

Wait, no. Let me count:

From 12/12 to 12/31 is 19 days (including both dates? Or not? Wait, 12/12 to 12/13 is 1 day, and so on. So 12/12 to 12/30 is 19 days. Then 12/31 is day 20.

December has 31 days, so after 12/30, the next 31 days are December, which ends on 12/31 at day 20 +31=51.

Then January: 31 days, so 51 days into January would be day 51 +31=82, which is beyond 60. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me try a different approach. Let's add 60 days to November 12.

November 12 + 60 days.

November has 30 days. So from November 12 to November 30 is 30 -12 +1 =19 days. So 19 days in November.

Then December has 31 days, so 60 -19 =41 days remaining.

41 days in December: 31 days, so 31 days in December brings us to 12/31, which is day 50 (19+31=50).

Then January has 31 days, so 60-50=10 days in January.

So starting from 12/12, adding 60 days would be 12/12 +10 days (since 10 days is January 10, 11, etc.)

Wait, wait. Let's count the days. 12/12 is day 0. Then each day adds one.

So 60 days:

Day 0: 12/12.

Day 1: 12/13.

...

Continuing until day 60.

Another way: 60 divided by 30 is 2 months, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using a day calculator.

Wait, perhaps using an online calculator would be easier, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed step by step.

Let me count month by month:

- 12/12 to 12/30: 19 days (including both dates?) Wait, no: 12/12 is the starting day, so 12/13 is day 1, 12/30 is day 18. So 19 days in November (12/12 to 12/30 inclusive).

Remaining days:60-19=41.

Then December:31 days. So 31 days in December would take us to day 19+31=50.

Remaining:41-31=10 days into January.

So January 10 is 10 days after 12/30. So the maturity date is January 10.

Wait, but wait, 12/12 +60 days: let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, 60 days is approximately 2 months. November has 30 days, so 12/12 plus 60 days is 2 months and 6 days. November 12 plus 2 months is November 12 + 30 (since November is 30 days) = November 30 + 6 days. So November 30 plus 6 days is December 6. Wait, that can't be right because that's 60 days? No, November 12 plus 60 days: November has 30 days, so 30-12 +1 =19 days from Nov 12 to Nov 30.

Wait, no. Wait, adding 60 days to November 12:

From Nov 12, adding 60 days.

60 days: 2 months (60 days) is Nov 12 + 60 days.

November has 30 days. So 60 days after Nov 12 is 60 - 30 =30 days into December, which is Dec 29. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 60 days is 2 months. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me count the days:

Start: 12/12.

Add 1 day: 12/13.

... That's tedious. Maybe I'll use a different method.

I remember that adding 60 days to a date is like moving 2 months and 6 days. Let's see: November 12 + 60 days.

November has 30 days, so adding 2 months would take us to November 30 (12 days in November?), wait no:

Wait, November has 30 days, so 30 days after Nov 12 is Nov 30. Then adding another 30 days (for the next two months) would take us to December 30. But we have 60 days, which is 2 months (60 days). So 60 days after Nov 12 is Nov 12 +60 days= November 12 + 30 (for November) +30 (for December) = November 12 + 60 days = November 30 + 30 days = December 30. Wait, that would be 60 days? No, because November 12 + 30 days is November 30, then adding another 30 days would be December 30. So 60 days after Nov 12 is December 30. Hmm, but that seems like 60 days. Let me check:

From Nov 12 to Nov 30: 19 days (including both dates). Then Dec has 31, so 19+31=50. Then, 60-50=10 days into January. So 10 days after Jan 1 is Jan 10.

Wait, so that would be 10 days after Jan 1, which is Jan 10. So the maturity date is Jan 10.

Wait, but if I add 60 days to Nov 12, I get Dec 30. That would be 60 days.

Wait, no: November has 30 days. So 60 days is 2 months, November 12 to December 29 (which is 60 days). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of a different approach.

Wait, 30 days is November (including Nov 12, so 19 days). Then Dec 31 is day 50 (19+31=50). Then adding 10 more days: Jan 10 is the 60th day. So the correct answer would be Jan 10.

So for part (a), the answer is Jan 10.

Now part (b): June 10, paid 3 months after date.

June has 30 days. So adding 3 months.

June 10 + 3 months is September 10. Because June 10 + 3 months is June 10 + 3*30=90 days. But wait, 3 months is exactly 90 days, but wait, June has 30 days. So 3 months would be June 10 to September 10.

Wait, June 10 plus 3 months: June has 30 days, so June 10 +3 months is June 10 + 3*30=90 days. But wait, that's way beyond the end of June. Let me think: June 10 + 3 months is September 10. Because 3 months later, regardless of the number of days, the month changes. So June 10 +3 months is September 10. So the maturity date is September 10.

Wait, that seems correct. So (b) is Sep 10.

Part (c): March 3, payable 30 days after sight, accepted March 15.

So the payment is 30 days after the date. But it's accepted on March 15, so the due date is 30 days after March 15.

So March 15 +30 days.

March has 31 days.

15 March +30 days is April 14. Let me count:

March: 15 +30=45 days in March.

March has 31 days, so 45-31=14 days into April. So April 14.

Wait, let me count the days:

March 15: day 0.

March 16:1, March 17:2,... up to March 31:16 days.

Then April 1:17, April 14:16+14=30.

Wait, no, wait: March 15 is day 0. March 31 is day 16 (because 15+16=31). Then April 1 is day 17. So day 30 would be April 14 (17 +14=31). Wait, no: day 17 is April 1, day 18 April 2, ..., day 30 is April 15 (since 17+14=31, which is April 15. So day 30 is April 15. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should add 30 days.

March 15 is day 0.

March 15 +30 days would be March 15 +30 days.

March has 31 days, so 30 days after March 15 is March 25 (since March 15 +30 days is March 25). Wait, no: March 15 +30 days is March 25 (since March has 31 days, 31-15=16 days remaining in March). 30 days would take us to March 25 (16 +14=30). So, March 25 is 16 days in March. So 30 days is March 25 +14 days (April 14). Wait, no: 16 days in March plus 14 days in April is 30 days.

So the due date is April 14.

Wait, but I thought March 15 +30 days is April 14. So (c) is April 14.

Wait, but the options suggest (c) is April 14. So that's correct.

Part (d): October 4, payable 6 months after sight, accepted October 25.

So the payment is 6 months after October 25, but the due date is October 25 plus 6 months.

So October 25 +6 months is June 25, because October has 31 days, but 6 months is 180 days.

Wait, let me calculate again.

October 25 +6 months: October is 31 days.

6 months from October 25:

October 25 is day 0.

October has 31 days. So 31 -25 =6 days remaining in October. So October 31 is day 6.

Then November has 30 days, December 31, January 31, February 28 (assuming not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30.

Wait, but 6 months is 180 days. So let me count:

October 25 +6 months = October 25 +180 days.

October has 31 days. So 25 to 31 is 6 days. So 6 days into October, which is October 31? No, wait, 6 days after October 25 is October 31? No, 25 +6 is 31, which is October 31.

Then, adding 180 days: October 31 is day 6.

Then November: 30 days, so 6+30=36.

December:31, 36+31=67.

January:31, 67+31=98.

February:28, 98+28=126.

March:31, 126+31=157.

April:30, 157+30=187.

Wait, 187 days is beyond 180, so perhaps I should stop at 180. So let me count month by month:

October 25 + 180 days.

October 25 to October 31: 6 days (25,26,27,28,29,30,31—wait, 31-25=6, so 6 days.

Then November: 30 days. 6+30=36.

December: 31. 36+31=67.

January:31. 67+31=98.

February:28. 98+28=126.

March:31. 126+31=157.

April:30. 157+30=187.

Wait, that's 187 days, but we need 180. So perhaps I should subtract 7 days.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

October 25 +180 days.

October: 31 days. So 25 to 31 is 6 days. So after October 31, we have 180-6=174 days.

November has 30. 174-30=144.

December:31. 144-31=113.

January:31. 113-31=82.

February:28. 82-28=54.

March:31. 54-31=23.

April:23 days. So April 23 is the due date.

Wait, but that's from October 25. Let me check:

October 25 +180 days.

Using the day count method:

October 25 to October 31:6 days.

November:30, makes 36.

December:31, 67.

January:31, 98.

February:28, 126.

March:31, 157.

April:23 days (because 157+23=180).

So the due date is April 23.

Wait, but I thought the payment was 6 months after October 25, which would be June 25. But that's incorrect because June is 6 months away, not December.

So for part (d), the due date is April 23.

Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, 180 days from October 25. Let me use a different approach.

October has 31 days. So 31-25=6 days remaining in October. So 6 days after October 25 is October 31, which is day 6.

Then November has 30 days: 6+30=36 (day 36).

December 31:36+31=67 (day 67).

January 31:67+31=98 (day 98).

February 28:98+28=126 (day 126).

March 31:126+31=157 (day 157).

April:157+23=180 (day 180).

So due date is April 23.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because I'm considering day 25 as day 0. Let me recheck:

October 25 is day 0.

October 25 +1 day is October 26: day 1.

...

October 25 +6 days is October 31: day 6.

Then:

November 1: day7.

...

November 30: day36.

December 1: day37.

...

December 31: day67.

January 1: day68.

...

January 31: day98.

February 1: day99.

...

February 28: day126.

March 1: day127.

...

March 31: day157.

April 1: day158.

...

April 23: day180.

Yes, that's correct. So (d) is April 23.

Now, let me check the options provided for each part.

Looking at the options:

Looking for part (a): Jan 10.

Looking for part (b): Sep 10.

Looking for part (c): Apr 14.

Looking for part (d): Apr 23.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Jan 10, B: Sep 10, C: Apr 14, D: Apr 23.

So the answers are (a) Jan 10, (b) Sep 10, (c) Apr 14, (d) Apr 23.

Looking at the options provided:

The options for each part are given as A, B, C, D.

So the correct answers would be:

A: Jan 10.

B: Sep 10.

C: Apr 14.

D: Apr 23.

So the order of the options is A, B, C, D.

Thus, the correct answer is option D: (d) April 23.

Wait, but the options are:

Answer options:

A) Jan 10, Sep 10, Apr 14, April 23.

B) same.

C) same.

D) same.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the options are presented as:

A) Jan 10, Sep 10, April 14, April 23.

B) same.

C) same.

D) same.

So the correct answer is D.

Thus, the final answers are:

(a) Jan 10

(b) Sep 10

(c) Apr 14

(d) Apr 23

Which corresponds to option D.

So, the answer is option D.
</think>

The correct answers for each part are:

(a) January 10  
(b) September 10  
(c) April 14  
(d) April 23

Thus, the final answer is option D.

ANSWER: D
