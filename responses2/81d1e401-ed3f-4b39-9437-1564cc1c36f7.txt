C: The Neoclassical Economists
D: The Mercantilists

Okay, so I have this economics question here. Let me try to work through it. The question is about the school of economists traditionally supporting government intervention in the economy for both redistributing resources and affecting economic activity. I need to pick the right answer from options A to H.

First, I'll read the question again carefully. It says that government intervention affects both the level of economic activity and redistributes resources. So, two main points: both policies that make things work better for the economy (like increasing spending or reducing taxes) and policies that move resources from the rich to the poor.

The question is about the school that traditionally supported both. So I'm looking for an economic school that believed that government policies were effective in both redistributing resources and promoting economic activity.

I remember that the classical economists, like Adam Smith and David Ricardo, thought that the economy was naturally arranged for fairness and efficiency. They believed that the market could correct itself, so government intervention was a mistake. Wait, no, wait. The classical school, also called classical economists, believed that the market economy was self-regulating. So they would argue against government intervention. Because they thought the market would manage itself. So that would mean that the classical school would not support government intervention for redistributing resources. Hmm, but the question says both redistributing resources and affecting economic activity. So classical might not be the right answer because they wouldn't support redistribution.

What about supply-side economists? I think that school believes in government intervention. They argue that policies like taxes and regulations are necessary to redistribute resources and stimulate the economy. For example, progressive taxes might help lower the middle class and redistribute wealth. They also believe that increasing public spending is effective in boosting economic activity. So this seems to fit.

The other options: Classical, Neoclassical, etc. Let me think. Neoclassical economists, like those in the Keynesian school, probably don't believe in government intervention for both reasons. They might focus more on market forces and private enterprise. The Classical school, as I said, don't think so.

The Keynessians, like those in Keynesian economics, do believe in government intervention. They argue that the government needs to stimulate the economy through fiscal policies. But I'm not sure about redistribution. Wait, do they also believe in redistribution? I thought they were more focused on distribution, but maybe their view on redistribution is part of their broader policies. Alternatively, the classical school didn't support redistribution, as per earlier reasoning.

The other options: The Chicago School (Sraffa?), I think he was more about distribution andclasses and prices, but I don't think he supported government intervention for both aspects. The Institutional Economists focus on institutions and how they affect the economy. Monetarists worry too much about money and interest rates. The Austrian School of Economics, I think is more about classical vs. socialism, and they believe that private markets can't solve all economic problems, but perhaps they supported some government intervention? Or maybe they didn't. Wait, no, the Austrian school was pro-summerism, for redistribution.

Wait, the Austrian School was pro-summerism, which is about redistributing resources to lower the middle class. But they also believed that the government shouldn't rely on private markets and could have too much control. So, they might support government intervention for both redistributing resources and promoting economic growth. But I'm not certain about that. Let's see.

Wait, the question is about the school that traditionally supported both. So which school's belief was that both are correct?

The classical school didn't. The supply-side school does. The Austrian School might have more of a pro-summerism perspective, which is redistribution, but perhaps they didn't believe in government intervention for economic growth. Or did they? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the question asks for the school that supported both. The classical school didn't support intervention for redistribution, so it can't be. The supply-side (A) is the answer. The other options: The Keynessians (Keynesians) do believe in government intervention, but perhaps they didn't support redistribution as much as the classical. Or do they?

Wait, maybe the classical school didn't support redistribution, and supply-side does. The supply-side school's school (A) would answer the question.

So from the options, the correct answer should be A: The Supply-side Economists.

The correct answer is **A: The Supply-side Economists**. These economists, such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, believed that government intervention was ineffective for both redistributing resources and promoting economic activity. They argued that markets and private enterprise could address these issues. 

Answer: A
