Question:

Which reason may constitute sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to enable a litigant to file a late notice of appeal past the 30-day deadline?

Options:

A: The district court judge assured the litigant that the late filing would be permitted.
B: The litigant's original attorney neglected to file notice on time, and now the litigant has retained a new attorney to file the appeal and has also sued the former attorney for malpractice.
C: The litigant ran a red light causing a car crash just before the judgment was rendered, and was in the hospital for two months recovering.
D: Opposing counsel agreed not to object to the late notice of appeal.

Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about why a litigant might file a late notice of appeal over the 30-day deadline. The options are A, B, C, D, and E (though the options given don't have E, so I'll stick to the four).

I remember that a late notice of appeal can be excusable if the reason is a good cause. The main points to consider are when the litigant can justify the delay, and if the reason is reasonable enough.

Looking at the options:

A: The court said the late filing is permitted. That sounds like a valid reason. If the court allows it, the litigant can file late. So A seems possible.

B: The original attorney didn't file on time, now the litigant has a new one, and the litigant sued the old one for malpractice. I'm not sure about this. The new attorney suing the old for malpractice might not be a good cause. Malpractice usually involves negligence or breach of contract, not a notice filing delay. Also, the new attorney might have a legitimate reason, but the original's failure to file might not be the main reason here. So B might not be a good excuse.

C: The litigant ran a red light just before judgment, was in the hospital for two months. That's serious, but perhaps a cause of action. But is that a reason for a late appeal notice? Maybe, but I'm not certain. The fact that the litigant was in the hospital might be an event that could lead to a lawsuit, but it's not directly about the notice being late. So maybe C isn't the best answer.

D: Opposing counsel didn't object. If the litigant didn't object, maybe the court allowed it. But I'm not sure if that's a good cause. If the opposing attorney didn't object, perhaps the original attorney didn't have the right to file a late notice. So D might not be a sufficient excuse.

So the options left are A and B. Between them, A is about the judge allowing it, which seems more likely to be a good cause. B involves the original attorney failing to file, which might not be a sufficient reason. Also, the reason in B is that the original attorney didn't file, and now the litigant has a new one. But the litigant suing the old one for malpractice could be a reason, but I'm not sure if that's a good excuse for a notice filing delay. Malpractice cases are more about breach of contract, which doesn't directly relate to a notice of appeal being late. So I think B is less likely to be a good cause.

Therefore, the best answer is A. The court allowed the late filing because of a good cause.

The correct answer is **A: The district court judge assured the litigant that the late filing would be permitted.**

**Explanation:**
- Option A indicates that the court allowed the late filing due to a valid reason, which is a sufficient excuse for a late notice of appeal.
- Option B involves the original attorney failing to file on time, which is unlikely to be a good cause for a late appeal notice.
- Options C and D are less likely to be valid excuses, as they do not clearly justify the delay.

Thus, A provides a clear and reasonable explanation for the late notice of appeal.

Answer: A
