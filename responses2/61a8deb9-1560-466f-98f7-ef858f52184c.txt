Okay, so I've got this problem here: "In how many ways can a group of 9 people be divided into 3 non-empty subsets?" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dividing a set into subsets, it's related to combinatorics and permutations. 

Wait, the question says "non-empty subsets." So each subset must have at least one person. That makes me think about the concept of set partitions. Oh right, the number of ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets is given by something called the Stirling numbers of the second kind. I think the formula is S(n, k), where n is the number of elements, and k is the number of subsets. 

So for 9 people divided into 3 non-empty subsets, it would be S(9,3). But wait, I need to remember the formula for Stirling numbers. Oh yeah, the formula involves a summation with binomial coefficients. The general formula is S(n,k) = (1/k!) * sum_{i=0 to k} [ (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (k - i)^n ].

Alternatively, I think there's another way involving combinations. The formula might also be written as S(n,k) = (1/(k!)) * sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (k - i)^n. Wait, that seems correct. 

Let me plug in n=9 and k=3. So S(9,3) would be (1/3!)[C(3,0)*3^9 - C(3,1)*2^9 + C(3,2)*1^9]. 

Calculating each term step by step:

First, 3! is 6.

C(3,0) is 1, so that term is 1*3^9.
3^9 is 19683.

Next, C(3,1) is 3, so that term is 3*(-2^9). 2^9 is 512, so 3*(-512) = -1536.

Third term: C(3,2) is 3, and 1^9 is 1. So 3*1 = 3.

Putting it all together: (1/6)[19683 -1536 +3] = (1/6)(19683 -1533) → 19683 -1533 is 18150. Then 18150 divided by 6. Let me compute that: 18150 ÷6 = 3025. So S(9,3) is 3025.

Wait, but the options given don't have 3025 as the first option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A: 2500
B: 560
C: 1512
D:4096
E:3025
F:3500
G:1287
H:2100
I:5000
J:4500

Oh wait, E is 3025. So the answer should be E. But wait, I'm a bit confused because another formula for the number of ways to partition n elements into k non-empty subsets is also possible. I remember that it's equal to the Stirling numbers of the second kind multiplied by k! if the subsets are labeled, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, when the subsets are labeled, it's indeed S(n,k)*k!. But in this question, the subsets are not labeled. So the number of ways is S(n,k). So for example, if the subsets are indistinct, then it's S(n,k). So in this case, the answer is 3025, which is option E.

So looking at the options, E is 3025. So the correct answer is E.

The problem requires finding the number of ways to divide 9 people into 3 non-empty subsets, which is given by the Stirling number of the second kind, S(9,3). Calculating it using the formula leads to 3025, matching option E.
