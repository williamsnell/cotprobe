Okay, so I have this bond question here, and I need to figure out the price of a 3-year bond with a 100-par value. The coupon is 6%, so that's 6% of 100, which is $6 each year. The spot rates are given: 1-year is 3%, 2-year is 4%, and 3-year is 5%. 

I remember that the price of a bond is the present value of all its future cash flows. So for a 3-year bond, I need to calculate the present value of the coupon payments and the present value of the par value (face value) at the end of the third year.

Wait, right. So the formula is the sum of the present value of each coupon payment plus the present value of the par value. 

So let's break it down. The bond has three cash flows: at the end of year 1, year 2, and year 3. 

First, the coupon payments are $6 each year. So the first coupon is paid at t=1, the second at t=2, and the third at t=3.

So the present value of each coupon is calculated using the respective spot rates. 

For the first coupon: PV1 = 6 / (1 + 3%) = 6 / 1.03.

Second coupon: PV2 = 6 / (1 + 4%)^2 = 6 / (1.04)^2.

Third coupon: PV3 = 6 / (1 + 5%)^3 = 6 / (1.05)^3.

Then, the present value of the par value is PV4 = 100 / (1 + 5%)^3.

Then, sum all these PVs to get the bond price.

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, calculate each PV.

PV1: 6 / 1.03. Let me compute that. 1.03 is approximately 1.03. 6 / 1.03 is about 5.8241.

PV2: 6 divided by (1.04)^2. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. So 6 / 1.0816 ≈ 5.5343.

PV3: 6 divided by (1.05)^3. 1.05 cubed is 1.1576. 6 / 1.1576 ≈ 5.1817.

PV4: 100 / (1.05)^3. As above, (1.05)^3 is 1.1576. So 100 / 1.1576 ≈ 86.383.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, 1.05 cubed is 1.157625. So 100 / 1.157625 equals approximately 86.383.

Now, sum all these present values:

PV1 + PV2 + PV3 + PV4 = 5.8241 + 5.5343 + 5.1817 + 86.383.

Adding them up step by step.

5.8241 +5.5343 is 11.3584.

11.3584 +5.1817 is 16.5401.

16.5401 +86.383 is 102.9231.

Wait, so the sum is approximately 102.9231. So the bond's price is about $102.92. 

Looking at the options, option J is 102.95. Wait, my calculation is 102.923, which is about 102.92, so perhaps the options round to two decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me double-check each PV calculation.

Let me calculate each term again.

PV1: 6 / 1.03.

1.03 is 1.03. Dividing 6 by 1.03. Let me compute this more accurately.

6 / 1.03 = approx 5.824096.

PV2: 6 / (1.04)^2. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. 6 / 1.0816 = approx 5.5343.

PV3: 6 / (1.05)^3. 1.05^3 is 1.157625. 6 / 1.157625 ≈ 5.181736.

PV4: 100 / (1.05)^3 = 100 / 1.157625 ≈ 86.383.

Adding them all:

5.824096 +5.5343 = 11.358396.

11.358396 +5.181736 = 16.540132.

16.540132 +86.383 = 102.923132. So about $102.92.

Looking at the options, option J is 102.95, which is very close. The options don't have any others close. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the price of the 3-year bond, calculate the present value of each cash flow using the given spot rates:

1. **Coupon Payments**:
   - Year 1: \( \frac{6}{1.03} \approx 5.8241 \)
   - Year 2: \( \frac{6}{(1.04)^2} \approx 5.5343 \)
   - Year 3: \( \frac{6}{(1.05)^3} \approx 5.1817 \)

2. **Face Value**:
   - \( \frac{100}{(1.05)^3} \approx 86.383 \)

3. **Sum of Present Values**:
   - \( 5.8241 + 5.5343 + 5.1817 + 86.383 \approx 102.923 \)

The bond's price is approximately $102.92, which rounds to $102.95. The correct answer is:

**ANSWER: J**
