Okay, so I've got this problem here about three planets, X, Y, and Z, and their orbital periods are 360, 450, and 540 days respectively. The question is asking for the minimum number of days before all three planets align again in the same positions relative to their sun. That sounds like it's related to finding a common multiple of their orbital periods.

Hmm, right. So, if I remember correctly, when you have multiple repeating events, the least common multiple (LCM) is the smallest number that all of their multiples coincide. So, the LCM of their orbital periods will give me the time when they'll all be back in the same position.

But wait, let's make sure. The planets are lined up with the sun as the endpoint. So, each planet completes a full orbit and returns to the starting point. So, their orbital periods are the number of days it takes each to make a full circle. So, when all three have completed an integer number of orbits, they'll all be back at the starting position.

Okay, so the problem reduces to finding the LCM of 360, 450, and 540. That makes sense.

Now, how do I find the LCM of these numbers? I think one approach is to factor each into their prime factors and then take the highest power of each prime that appears.

Let's break them down.

360: Let's factor this.
360 divided by 2 is 180.
180 divided by 2 is 90.
90 divided by 2 is 45. So, two 2s here.
45 divided by 3 is 15.
15 divided by 3 is 5.
5 divided by 5 is 1. So, two 3s and one 5.

So, 360 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^1.

450: Let's factor this.
450 divided by 2 is 225. So, one 2.
225 divided by 3 is 75.
75 divided by 3 is 25.
25 divided by 5 is 5.
5 divided by 5 is 1. So, one 2, two 3s, and two 5s.

So, 450 = 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^2.

540: Let's factor this.
540 divided by 2 is 270.
270 divided by 2 is 135. So, two 2s.
135 divided by 3 is 45.
45 divided by 3 is 15.
15 divided by 3 is 5.
5 divided by 5 is 1. So, two 2s, three 3s, and one 5.

So, 540 = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^1.

Now, the LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization of these numbers.

So, primes involved are 2, 3, and 5.

Looking at each:

- For 2: The exponents are 3 (from 360), 1 (from 450), and 2 (from 540). The highest is 3.
- For 3: The exponents are 2 (from 360), 2 (from 450), and 3 (from 540). The highest is 3.
- For 5: The exponents are 1 (from 360), 2 (from 450), and 1 (from 540). The highest is 2.

So, the LCM is 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^2.

Let's compute that step by step.

2^3 is 8.

3^3 is 27.

5^2 is 25.

Now, multiply them together: 8 * 27 = 216. Then 216 * 25.

Wait, 216 * 25: Well, 216 * 10 is 2160, so 2160 * 2.5 is 5400.

Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, 25 is 100/4, so 216 * 100 is 21600, divided by 4 is 5400. Yep, same result.

So, the LCM is 5400 days. Looking at the options, option G is 5400. So, the answer should be G.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of days until all three planets align again. This is the least common multiple (LCM) of their orbital periods: 360, 450, and 540 days.

- **Factorization:**
  - 360 = \(2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
  - 450 = \(2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)
  - 540 = \(2^2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)

- **Highest Powers:**
  - \(2^3\), \(3^3\), \(5^2\)

- **LCM Calculation:**
  - \(8 \times 27 \times 25 = 5400\)

The correct answer is **5400 days**, which corresponds to option G.
