Okay, so I have this problem where BaskowToys Wholesalers is offering Captain Kirk dolls at 25-20% off the retail price. Albee Stores buys each doll for $2.10. I need to find the retail price. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, wait, the discount is 25-20% off. Does that mean 25% off, or 20% off? The wording says 25-20%, which could be 25% followed by 20%... but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a consecutive discount, like 25% off the already discounted price by another 20%. Or maybe it's a 5% combined discount? Wait, no, 25-20% could mean 25% off the original, and then another 20% off from that reduced price. So the total discount would be 25% plus an additional 20% on the new price.

Wait, no, that's not right. If you have two successive discounts, like 25% and then another 20%, the way to calculate the total discount is a bit different. Let me think. For example, if an item is $100, a 25% discount brings it to $75. Then a 20% discount on $75 is $15, so total discount is $25. But that's a total of 50% off the original, not 45% (25+20=45). So the overall discount isn't just the sum because the second discount is applied to a lower amount.

Wait, but in this problem, Albee Stores is buying each doll for $2.10. So the cost to them is $2.10, which is after the discount. So I think the problem is that the store is offering a 25% discount from the retail price, and then Albee buys at $2.10. So maybe it's a single discount of 25% off, and the cost is after that. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says "25-20% off the retail price." Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean two things: either it's a 25% discount followed by a 20% discount, or it's a 45% discount total (25+20=45%). Alternatively, perhaps it's a 20% discount on top of the 25%, but that would be 25% + 20% = 45% total. Wait, no, that's not how discounts work. The way to calculate is to multiply the remaining percentages.

Wait, let's clarify. Let's say the retail price is R. If the store offers a 25% discount, that leaves 75% of R. Then, if there's an additional 20% discount, that would be 80% of the already discounted price. So the final price would be R * 0.75 * 0.80 = R * 0.60. Wait, that would be a 40% total discount, not 45% because 25+20 is 45, but the way it's applied is different. So the total discount is 40%, not 45%. So the cost price is 60% of R.

Wait, but let's think again. If the first discount is 25%, then the price is R * 0.75. Then, a second discount of 20% on that price would make it R * 0.75 * 0.80 = R * 0.60. So the cost is 60% of the original. So the cost price for Albee is $2.10, which is 60% of R. So R = $2.10 / 0.60.

Wait, let me calculate that: 2.10 divided by 0.60. 2.10 / 0.60 is 3.50. So R would be $3.50. Looking at the options, option A is $3.50. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the way the discounts are applied. Let me make sure. So the problem says "25-20% off the retail price." I think that's a 25% discount followed by a 20% discount, leading to a 40% discount. Alternatively, sometimes in sales, they might apply a 45% discount in one go. Which one is correct?

Wait, let me think of an example. Let's say the retail price is $100. 25% off brings it to $75. Then 20% off from $75 is $75 * 0.8 = $60. So the final price is $60. So the cost to Albee is $60, which is the retail price minus 40%. So the cost is 60% of R. So R is $60 / 0.60 = $100.

But in the problem, Albee stores buys each doll for $2.10, so R would be 2.10 / 0.60 = 3.50. So that would be correct.

But wait, another way: maybe the problem says 25-20% off is a single discount of 45%? Then R * 0.55 = 2.10. So R would be 2.10 / 0.55 = 3.818..., which is approximately $3.82. But that's not one of the options. The closest options are H: $3.00 and J: $2.80.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the 25% is the discount, and the 20% is the markup or something else. Wait, no, the question says 25-20% off the retail price. Oh wait, maybe it's 25% and then an additional 20% off on top of that. So the total discount is 25% +20% =45%. So the cost price is 55% of R.

So R = 2.10 / 0.55. Let me compute that: 2.10 ÷ 0.55 ≈ 3.818, which is approximately $3.82. But the options don't have that. The closest is H: $3.00 and J: $2.80. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the discounts. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the way to calculate it is to consider that the store is offering 25% off, but then Albee buys it at $2.10, which is the discounted price. So the retail price is the original, and the discounted price is 2.10. So perhaps the problem is that the discount is 25% off the retail price, but the cost price for Albee is 2.10, which is after the discount. So that would mean that 2.10 is 75% of the original price, because 25% is taken off.

Wait, no. If the retail price is R, and 25% discount is applied, then the selling price is 0.75 R. But Albee buys it at 2.10, which is the selling price. So 0.75 R = 2.10, so R = 2.10 / 0.75 = 2.80. That would be option J.

Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion. So which is correct?

Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says, "BaskowToys Wholesalers is offering Albee Stores the new Captain Kirk doll at 25-20% off the retail price." So it's a single discount of 25% off, and the cost to Albee is 2.10. So if the discount is 25%, then the selling price is 75% of retail. So 75% R = cost price. So R = 2.10 / 0.75.

Wait, 2.10 divided by 0.75 is 2.80. So the retail price would be $2.80. So option J. That's what I got when I considered 25% off. But earlier, when I thought it's a 45% total discount, I got $3.50. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. If the 25% discount is applied first, then the cost is 0.75 R = 2.10. So solving for R gives R = 2.10 / 0.75 = 2.80. So the retail price is $2.80. Which is option J.

But then, why did I get another answer before? Because I thought the discounts were in sequence, but maybe the problem is that the 25% is the discount, and the cost is 75% of R. So that would be correct.

Wait, but in that case, the 25% is the amount taken off. So the cost is 75% of R. So R = 2.10 / 0.75 = 2.80. So that's J. So the correct answer is J. But wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 25-20% is a 45% discount. So the cost is 55% of R. So 2.10 = 0.55 R. Then R = 2.10 / 0.55 ≈ 3.818. But none of the options is close to that. So that can't be right.

So, the correct interpretation is that the discount is 25% off the retail price, so 75% of R is the cost price. So R = 2.10 / 0.75 = 2.80. So the correct answer is J.
</think>

The problem requires determining the retail price when the Captain Kirk doll is offered at 25% off the retail price and bought by Albee Stores for $2.10. 

1. **Understanding the discount**: The discount is 25% off the retail price, meaning the selling price is 75% of the retail price (R).

2. **Setting up the equation**: 
   - Selling price = 75% of R → 0.75R = $2.10.
   
3. **Solving for R**: 
   - R = $2.10 / 0.75 = $2.80.

4. **Conclusion**: The retail price is $2.80, which corresponds to option J.

**Answer**: J
