Okay, so I have this question about calculating the ionization energy of singly ionized helium using Bohr theory. Hmm, I remember Bohr model is used for hydrogen and some other elements, especially when dealing with their energy levels. 

Wait, ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. For hydrogen, it's the energy needed to get an electron from the ground state to infinity. But helium is a helium ion, He+ which has two electrons. Oh right, the question says "singly ionized helium," meaning it's He+ with one electron removed, so it's like He⁺⁻? Wait no, wait: He has two protons and two electrons. If it's singly ionized, it means one electron is lost, so the ion is He+ with one electron left? Or wait, no. Oh wait, helium has two electrons, so when we lose one, it's He+ with one electron. Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no: He has an atomic number of 2, so two electrons. If it's singly ionized, one electron is removed, so the ion has one electron left. Or wait, no, maybe it's He+ with one electron. Wait, no, the ion would have one electron—so He⁺.

But wait, the Bohr model for hydrogen is n=1. For He⁺, the ground state would have n=1 as the only possible state. Because He⁺ only has one electron. So the energy levels for He+ would be similar to H, but with one electron. So the energy levels would be given by E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (Z² / n²) * (1/(Z'))^? Wait, wait, let me think. 

Wait, in hydrogen, the ground state energy is -13.6 eV. For He⁺, the atomic number Z is 2, but the ion has only one electron. So the formula should adjust accordingly. The formula for the ionization energy in the Bohr model for a hydrogen-like atom (which He+ is) is E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (Z^2) / n^2. But wait, no, because for He+ the Z is 2, but the electron is in the ground state (n=1). So the energy would be -13.6 * (2^2) / (1^2) * (1)^2? Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. 

Wait, the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom is E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (Z^2) / (n^2), where Z is the atomic number. So for He+, Z is 2. But wait, no, wait. Let's clarify: for neutral atoms, the ground state is n=1. For He+, the ground state has Z=2 because the nucleus has two protons, but the electron is in a 1s orbital. Wait, no: in He⁺, the electron is in the n=1 state, so Z is 1? Or is Z=2 because He has two protons? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. The formula for the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms is E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (Z²) / n², where Z is the atomic number. So for He⁺, Z is 2 (since He has 2 protons, so Z=2). But wait, the electron is in the n=1 state, so n=1. So the energy would be E = -13.6 * (2^2) / (1)² = -54.4 eV. But wait, the ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from the ground state. So the ionization energy is the difference between the ground state energy (which is E = -54.4 eV) and the energy when the electron is removed (which is E = 0 as it's a free electron). Wait, no: the ionization energy is the energy required to get the electron from the lowest energy state to the point where it's infinitely far away, so that the energy becomes zero. Because when you remove the electron, you need to do work equal to the energy of the initial state, because the electron is at rest, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the ionization energy is the absolute value of the ground state energy.

Wait no, wait. The ground state energy is E = -54.4 eV for He⁺. The ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the electron; that's the amount of energy you have to put into the system to get the electron to infinity, where the energy is zero. So the ionization energy would be the absolute value of the ground state energy. So that's 54.4 eV. But wait, wait, let's think about hydrogen. For hydrogen, the ground state is E = -13.6 eV, so ionization energy is 13.6 eV. Right, because you have to add 13.6 eV to get the electron to infinity.

So in He⁺, the ground state energy is -54.4 eV (because 13.6 * 2² = 54.4). So to remove the electron, you have to add 54.4 eV. So the ionization energy is 54.4 eV. But looking at the options, I see that option C is 70.215 eV, and option G is 54.394 eV. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, the formula for the ionization energy of hydrogen is E = 13.6 eV * (Z²) / (n^2) * (1/(Z))²? No, no, let's think again.

Wait, maybe I should approach this from the ionization energy formula. The ionization energy for a hydrogen-like atom is the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state. So the ground state energy is E = -13.6 eV * Z² / (n²). For helium, which has Z=2, and n=1 (ground state), E = -13.6 * (2)^2 / (1)^2 = -54.4 eV.

But the ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the electron. So the energy of the electron in the ground state is -54.4 eV. Since the electron is bound, you need to provide energy to get it to a point where it's no longer bound, which is at infinity (E=0). So the ionization energy is the energy difference between the ground state and the ionization point. So ionization energy = E(ionization point) - E(ground state). Wait, no, because when you remove the electron, it goes from E = -54.4 eV to E=0. So the energy you add is 54.4 eV.

Alternatively, the ionization energy is the energy required to take the electron from E = -54.4 eV to E = 0, so the energy is 54.4 eV. But wait, wait, no. Because the ionization energy is the energy you need to supply to the electron to remove it. So the electron's initial energy is negative (bound), so you have to add energy to get it to zero. So the ionization energy is 54.4 eV. But wait, none of the options exactly match. Let me check the options again. The options are:

Options:

A:48.359 eV

B:52.307 eV

C:70.215 eV

D:60.321 eV

E:49.977 eV

F:45.678 eV

G:54.394 eV

H:50.456 eV

I:58.642 eV

J:65.123 eV

So option G is 54.394 eV. Hmm, but from our calculation, it's 54.4 eV. So option G is 54.394 eV, which is very close. So perhaps the exact calculation is a bit more precise.

Wait, let me recalculate. The formula is E = 13.6 eV * Z² / n².

Wait, for He⁺, Z is 2, n=1. So 13.6 * (4) /1 = 54.4 eV. So ionization energy is 54.4 eV.

But looking at the options, option G is 54.394 eV. That's very close. So perhaps the actual calculation takes into account the fine structure or other factors, but in the Bohr model, the formula is simple.

Wait, but wait: the Bohr model might not be accurate for higher atoms, but for He⁺, the ground state is a hydrogen-like state with Z=2 and n=1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the ionization energy of He⁺, which is He with one electron removed. So that's the same as He⁺, which is a He+ ion (so Z=2, n=1 for the ground state). So the energy is indeed 54.4 eV. So the closest option is G:54.394 eV.

Wait, but wait, sometimes when you calculate ionization energy, you have to consider the Rydberg constant. Wait, the Rydberg constant R is 1.097373e+7 m⁻¹. The energy levels are E_n = - (R * Z^2) / n^2.

Wait, but the calculation using Rydberg would be E = - (R * Z^2) / n^2 for each level. So for He⁺:

E_1 = - R * (2)^2 / (1)^2 = -1.097373e7 m⁻¹ * 4 = -4.389492e7 m⁻¹ * eV conversion.

Wait, but wait, to convert from Rydberg's constant (in inverse meters) to electron volts, the formula is E (eV) = R * (Z^2) / (n^2) * (-13.6 eV). Ah, wait, wait, another way: the Rydberg constant R is 13.6 eV * Z² (for hydrogen-like atoms, E_n = -13.6 eV * Z² /n²).

So for He+, Z=2, n=1. So E_n = -13.6 * (2)^2 / (1)^2 = -54.4 eV. So ionization energy is 54.4 eV.

Looking at the options, option G is 54.394 eV, which is very close. So the answer would be G:54.394 eV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the formula is 13.6 * Z² / (n^2) * 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me compute that.

13.6 eV * (2)^2 / (1)^2 = 54.4 eV. So the ionization energy is 54.4 eV. But option G is 54.394, which is 0.006 eV less. Hmm, that's a small difference. Maybe it's a more precise calculation considering other factors, like the fine structure or relativistic effects. But in the Bohr model, these are neglected. So perhaps the question expects using the Bohr model, which gives 54.4 eV, which rounds to 54.4, but the option is 54.394, which is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy of the first ionization, which for He is 54.4 eV, and the options don't have this exact value, but perhaps the exact value is slightly less.

Wait, another approach: the ionization energy can also be calculated using the formula E = (Z² * R_H) * (1/n²) * 13.6 eV, where R_H is the Rydberg constant in eV. Wait, R_H is 13.6 eV. So Z=2, n=1.

So E = 2² * 13.6 * (1/1²) = 4 *13.6 = 54.4 eV. So that's the same as before.

So the correct answer is G:54.394 eV. But wait, 54.4 eV isn't exactly any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option G is 54.394 eV, which is very close to 54.4 eV. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

To calculate the ionization energy of singly ionized helium (He⁺) using the Bohr model, we start by noting that the ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the ground state of the atom. For a hydrogen-like atom, the energy levels are given by:

\[
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV} \cdot Z^2}{n^2}
\]

where:
- \( Z \) is the atomic number (for He⁺, \( Z = 2 \)),
- \( n \) is the principal quantum number (for the ground state, \( n = 1 \)).

Substituting the values for He⁺:
\[
E_1 = -\frac{13.6 \cdot (2)^2}{(1)^2} = -\frac{13.6 \cdot 4}{1} = -54.4 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from the ground state, which is the absolute value of the ground state energy:
\[
\text{Ionization Energy} = 54.4 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to 54.4 eV is **54.394 eV**, which corresponds to option **G**.
