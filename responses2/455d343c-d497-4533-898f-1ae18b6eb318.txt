Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light bulbs and ball bearings. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about imaging a light bulb using a steel ball bearing. The bulb is 2 inches in diameter and is imaged by a ball bearing that's 1 inch in diameter and located 20 inches away from the bulb. I need to find where the image is and what its diameter is.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. Are the bulb and the ball bearing placed in a straight line? I think so. So the bulb is a sphere, the ball bearing is another sphere. Maybe they're both in contact, or maybe the bulb is in front of the ball bearing. But wait, the problem says the ball bearing is 20 inches away from the bulb. So perhaps they're aligned along a straight line, with the bulb first, then the ball bearing.

The bulb is 2 inches in diameter. So its radius is 1 inch. The ball bearing is 1 inch in diameter, so its radius is 0.5 inches. Wait, but the question is about the image formed by the ball bearing. So we're probably dealing with a spherical mirror or a convex lens imaging setup, but wait, wait—the question doesn't specify. Oh, wait, the problem is about light bulb imaging, which can happen in a lens or a mirror. But wait, the setup is a steel ball bearing, which is a solid sphere. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact setup. Oh, wait, perhaps this is related to the concept of a convex mirror or a concave mirror.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think. Maybe it's a spherical mirror setup. So when you have a spherical mirror, the image can be real or virtual, depending on the position. Since the ball bearing is placed 20 inches away, and the bulb is 2 inches in diameter, so the object distance is perhaps 20 inches. Wait, but the object is the light bulb. The bulb is a sphere, and the ball bearing is another sphere. So perhaps the bulb is the object, and the ball bearing is the image? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, the problem says the ball bearing is located 20 inches away from the bulb. So perhaps the bulb is the object, the ball bearing is the image. But wait, I'm not sure about the orientation. Another possibility is that the bulb is the source of light, and the ball bearing is the image. So perhaps the bulb is a point source, and the ball bearing is the image formed by reflecting or refracting the light.

But wait, the bulb is a sphere, so it's a spherical object. So the image formation would depend on the mirror's properties. Since the ball bearing is another sphere, perhaps the setup is such that the bulb is at the object, and the ball bearing is the image. Or maybe the opposite. Wait, no, the problem says the bulb is imaged by the ball bearing. So the bulb is the object, and the ball bearing is the image. Hmm.

Wait, but that can't be right because a spherical object can't form an image in the same position unless the mirror is flat, which it's not. Wait, perhaps the bulb is a convex mirror, and the ball bearing is placed at a distance to form a real image. Alternatively, the bulb is a concave mirror, and the image is formed by it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the mirror formula. The mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f is the focal length, u is the object distance, and v is the image distance. But wait, I don't know the focal length of the ball bearing. Oh wait, wait, the ball bearing is a sphere, but for a spherical mirror, the focal length is half the radius. Wait, no, that's for a spherical mirror. Wait, no, wait: for a convex mirror, the focal length is negative, but the radius is positive. So the focal length f is -R/2, where R is the radius.

Wait, but the ball bearing is 1 inch in diameter, so radius is 0.5 inches. So for a convex mirror, which the ball bearing is, the focal length would be f = -0.5/2 = -0.25 inches. Wait, but the sign depends on the convention. Alternatively, if the mirror is concave, f would be positive. Wait, wait I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the ball bearing is acting as a convex mirror. Wait, but the ball bearing is solid, so if it's placed at some distance, maybe it's acting as a mirror. Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that the bulb is a point source, and the ball bearing is a convex mirror, so the light is reflecting off it. So the image formed would be virtual and located on the same side as the object, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ball bearing is placed in front of the bulb, and the image is formed by the reflection of light from the bulb off the ball bearing. But wait, the bulb is a sphere, so the ball bearing is a mirror placed at a distance. Let's think about this.

So the bulb is a sphere with a diameter of 2 inches, which is radius 1 inch. The ball bearing is a sphere with diameter 1 inch, radius 0.5 inches, placed 20 inches away. So the object is the bulb, and the image is the ball bearing. So we can think of this as a spherical mirror.

Wait, but the object is the bulb, which is a sphere, so the object is in front of the mirror. So for a spherical mirror, the mirror equation is similar to a thin lens. So 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. But wait, what's the focal length of the mirror?

Wait, but a spherical mirror has a focal length equal to half its radius of curvature. So if the mirror is convex, the focal length f is positive, and for a concave mirror, it's negative. But wait, the problem is with the ball bearing. Let's clarify whether the ball bearing is a convex or concave mirror.

Wait, the ball bearing is a sphere, so if it's placed in front of the bulb, and if the light is reflecting, then perhaps it's acting as a convex mirror. So the focal length would be negative.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the orientation. Alternatively, maybe the ball bearing is a convex mirror, so the focal length is negative.

So, let's compute the focal length. The ball bearing is a sphere with radius 0.5 inches. So, its radius R is 0.5 inches. If it's a convex mirror, then the focal length f is equal to R/2. Wait, no, no. Wait, for a spherical mirror, the focal length is R/2. So for a convex mirror, R is positive, so f = R/2. But wait, the focal length is positive for convex mirrors, negative for concave.

Wait, wait, no. The sign is a bit tricky. Wait, for a convex mirror, the focal length is positive? No, wait, no: I think I have it backwards. Wait, in optics, the focal length is positive for concave mirrors and negative for convex mirrors. So for a convex mirror, the focal length is negative. So if the ball bearing is a convex mirror, f would be negative.

Wait, let's think again. The radius of the ball bearing is 0.5 inches. So, if it's a convex mirror, the focal length is -0.25 inches. Because f = -R/2. Because for convex mirrors, focal length is negative. So R is 0.5, so R/2 is 0.25, so f is -0.25 inches.

Wait, but wait: Another way to think about it: The focal length is half the radius of the mirror. So for a convex mirror, R is positive, so f is positive. But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I'm getting the sign wrong. I think that for a convex mirror, the focal length is negative. So R is positive, so f = -R/2. So in this case, R is 0.5 inches, so f = -0.25 inches.

So now, the object is the bulb, which is 2 inches in diameter, so radius 1 inch. So the object distance u is the distance from the bulb to the mirror. But wait, the ball bearing is 20 inches away from the bulb. So if the bulb is the object, and the ball bearing is the image, then the object distance u is 20 inches.

Wait, but wait: If the bulb is a spherical object, and the ball bearing is placed 20 inches away, then the object is the bulb, and the image is the ball bearing. So u is the distance from the bulb to the mirror (the ball bearing). So u is 20 inches.

Wait, but the object is the bulb, which is a sphere, so the object distance u is 20 inches. The image is the ball bearing, so v is the distance from the mirror to the image. The question is, where is the image located relative to the mirror? So we need to find v.

Using the mirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

We have:

f = -0.25 inches (since it's a convex mirror)
u = 20 inches

So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u = 1/(-0.25) - 1/20.

Wait, wait: 1/f is 1/(-0.25) = -4, and 1/u is 1/20 = 0.05.

So 1/v = (-4) - 0.05 = -4.05.

Then v = 1 / (-4.05) ≈ -0.2469 inches.

Wait, but that's the distance from the mirror to the image. So v is negative, which indicates that the image is on the same side as the object. So the image is located 0.2469 inches behind the mirror. But since the mirror is a convex sphere, this would place the image in front of the mirror. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the mirror is a convex surface, so the image formed by a convex mirror is virtual and located behind the mirror. But wait, v is negative, which would mean the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. Wait, but that doesn't make sense for a convex mirror. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Let me re-examine the sign conventions. In optics, the mirror formula uses signs based on the direction of light. For a convex mirror, the focal length is negative. The object is on one side of the mirror, and the image is on the same side if the object is real. But for a convex mirror, the image is virtual and located behind the mirror. So in that case, v would be negative if the mirror is on the other side.

Wait, but I think I messed up the setup. Let me clarify: The object is the bulb, which is the source of light. The ball bearing is the mirror. So the object u is 20 inches in front of the mirror. The image is formed by the mirror on the opposite side of the mirror. So v is negative because it's on the same side as the object (assuming the object is real). But wait, no, for a convex mirror, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So v would be positive if the mirror is on the other side, but in our case, the mirror is in front, so the image would be on the opposite side of the mirror, which is where? It's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the mirror as being on the right side of the object, so the image is on the right side as well. Wait, but for a convex mirror, the image is always virtual and on the same side as the object. So the image would be on the same side as the object, which would be in front of the mirror.

Wait, but the mirror is placed 20 inches away from the bulb. So if the bulb is the object, the image is formed 24.69 inches behind the mirror, but the mirror is 20 inches away from the bulb. Wait, that can't be. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe it's not a mirror but a lens. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is using a lens, but the question is about image formation, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about a spherical aberration.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the bulb is a convex lens. Hmm, but the bulb is a sphere, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a spherical mirror, and the image is formed on the same side as the object.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should use the thin lens formula instead of the mirror formula. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a lens or a mirror. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the light bulb is imaged by a steel ball bearing located 20 inches away. So perhaps the steel ball bearing is the lens or the mirror. So the bulb is the object (2 inches diameter), and the mirror is the ball bearing, which is 1 inch in diameter, placed 20 inches away. So the image is formed by the ball bearing.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the ball bearing is a sphere, so it's a mirror, not a lens. Wait, unless it's acting as a convex lens. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ball bearing is acting as a mirror. So the bulb is the object, and the ball bearing is the mirror. So the image is formed by the mirror.

Wait, then the mirror formula applies. So let's recalculate.

Mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

We have:

u = 20 inches (object distance)
f = -0.25 inches (convex mirror, so negative focal length)
So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u = (-4) - (0.05) = -4.05.

So v = 1 / (-4.05) ≈ -0.2469 inches.

Wait, but that's a negative v, which would mean the image is on the same side as the object. But that can't be, because for a convex mirror, the image should be virtual and on the opposite side. So perhaps I made an error in sign conventions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the mirror formula as 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where u is positive if the object is on one side, and v is positive if the image is on the opposite side. But for a convex mirror, the focal length is negative. So perhaps in this case, the image is on the same side as the object, which would be impossible for a convex mirror. So perhaps I have the signs flipped.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a convex mirror, the image is virtual and located in front of the mirror. So in that case, the image is on the same side as the object, which would mean the image is in front of the mirror. So the object is at u = 20 inches, the image is at v = 24.69 inches in front of the mirror.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the mirror formula. Let me try again.

Wait, let me get the mirror formula correctly.

The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

Where:
u = object distance (positive if on one side, negative if on the other)
v = image distance (positive if on same side as object, negative if on opposite side)
f = focal length (positive for converging, negative for diverging)

For a convex mirror, the focal length is negative. So f = -R/2.

So R is the radius of the mirror. Wait, but what's the radius of the mirror here? The ball bearing is the mirror, with radius 0.5 inches. So R = 0.5 inches.

So f = -0.5 / 2 = -0.25 inches.

So u = 20 inches (object is 20 inches in front of the mirror, so positive).

Plugging into the mirror formula:

1/v = 1/f - 1/u = 1/(-0.25) - 1/20.

1/(-0.25) is -4, and 1/20 is 0.05.

So 1/v = -4 - 0.05 = -4.05.

So v = 1 / (-4.05) ≈ -0.2469 inches.

Wait, so v is negative, which means the image is on the same side as the object.

But wait, for a convex mirror, the image should be virtual and on the opposite side of the mirror. So if the image is on the same side as the object, that's impossible. So perhaps this indicates that the image is not formed by the mirror, but perhaps it's an error in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the ball bearing is acting as a convex mirror, but the object is on the opposite side. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me think again. The object is the bulb, which is in front of the mirror. The image is formed by the mirror.

Wait, but if the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, that's impossible for a convex mirror. So perhaps the problem is using a concave mirror. Let me recalculate for a concave mirror.

Wait, but the ball bearing's radius is 0.5 inches. If it's a concave mirror, then f would be positive. So f = 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 inches.

So u = 20 inches.

1/f = 1/0.25 = 4.

1/v = 4 - (1/20) = 4 - 0.05 = 3.95.

v = 1 / 3.95 ≈ 0.253 inches.

So the image is positive, meaning it's on the opposite side of the mirror from the object. So the image is virtual and located 0.253 inches behind the mirror.

Wait, but the mirror is the ball bearing, which is 20 inches away from the bulb. So the object is the bulb, the mirror is 20 inches away. So the image would be 0.253 inches behind the mirror. So the distance from the bulb to the image is 20 + 0.253 ≈ 20.253 inches. But the question asks for the image's position relative to the ball bearing. So the image is 0.253 inches on the same side as the object, which is 20 inches away.

Wait, but that leads to the image being located behind the mirror, which is 20 inches away from the bulb, so the image is 20 + 0.253 ≈ 20.253 inches from the bulb, and 0.253 inches behind the mirror. But the options don't include this.

Wait, but the options are given as (A) through (G), each with a certain distance. Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) 2 inches behind the ball bearing

B) 4 inches behind the ball bearing

C) 0.5 inches behind the ball bearing

D) 1 inch behind the ball bearing

E) 0.25 inches behind the ball bearing

F) 0.5 inches in front of the ball bearing

G) 1 inch in front of the ball bearing

So the image is 0.25 inches behind the ball bearing. That would correspond to option E.

Wait, but let me double-check. The mirror formula gives v ≈ 0.253 inches, which is approximately 0.25 inches. So the image is 0.25 inches behind the mirror, which is 20 inches away from the bulb. So the distance from the bulb to the image is 20 - 0.25 = 19.75 inches? Wait no, because the image is behind the mirror, so the distance from the bulb to the image is 20 + 0.25 = 20.25 inches. But the options include 20 inches, but that's not an option here. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the ball bearing is the mirror, and the bulb is the object. So using the mirror formula:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

f is the focal length. For a convex mirror, f is negative. So f = -0.25 inches.

u = 20 inches.

So 1/v = 1/(-0.25) - 1/20 → 1/v = -4 - 0.05 → -4.05 → v = -0.2469 inches.

So v is negative, which means the image is on the same side as the object. But for a convex mirror, the image should be virtual and on the opposite side. This is a contradiction, which implies that my initial assumptions are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the ball bearing is a convex mirror, but the object is virtual. Wait, perhaps the ball bearing is acting as a convex mirror, and the light is coming from the bulb, which is a virtual object. So the image is formed behind the mirror.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find the magnification. The magnification m is -v/u.

In our case, v is approximately -0.2469 inches.

So m = -(-0.2469)/20 ≈ 0.012345.

The magnification is positive, meaning the image is upright. But for a convex mirror, the image is always upright. So that's correct.

The image is virtual and located 0.2469 inches behind the mirror.

Wait, but that's confusing because for a convex mirror, the image should be behind the mirror and virtual.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mirror formula. Let me try again.

Mirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

u is positive if on the same side as the object, negative otherwise.

For a convex mirror, f is negative.

So in our case, the object is the bulb, which is in front of the mirror, so its u is positive (since the object is on the same side as the light). The image is virtual, so v is negative (since the image is on the opposite side from the object).

Wait, but in our calculation:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

f = -0.25, u = 20.

1/v = (1/f) - (1/u) = (-4) - (0.05) = -4.05.

v = 1/(-4.05) ≈ -0.2469 inches.

So v is indeed negative, which means the image is on the opposite side from the object, which is the same side as the mirror. So the image is behind the mirror.

Wait, but for a convex mirror, the image should be virtual and behind the mirror, which matches our calculation. So the image is 0.2469 inches behind the mirror.

But the options don't have 0.2469 inches. The closest is option E: 0.25 inches.

So the image is approximately 0.25 inches behind the ball bearing. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me think again. The ball bearing is the mirror, 20 inches away from the bulb.

The image is formed by the mirror, 0.2469 inches behind the mirror.

So the distance from the bulb to the image is 20 + 0.2469 ≈ 20.2469 inches. But the options don't have this; they have distances like 2 inches, 4 inches, etc.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in the mirror formula. Let me try using the lens formula instead. Wait, but the problem isn't about a lens; it's about a mirror. So perhaps I should consider the mirror formula again.

Wait, I'm getting confused because the image is virtual, so it's on the opposite side of the mirror. So in that case, the image is 0.2469 inches behind the mirror, which is 20 inches away from the bulb.

So the distance from the bulb to the image is 20 + 0.2469 = 20.2469 inches, but the options don't have this. The options are all in inches, but perhaps the image is in front of the mirror, but I must have done something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is wrong. Maybe the ball bearing is not a mirror but a convex lens.

Wait, if the ball bearing is a convex lens with f = 0.25 inches, and the object is the bulb, which is 20 inches in front of the lens, then the image is formed behind the lens.

Using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u = (4) - (0.05) = 3.95.

v = 1/3.95 ≈ 0.253 inches.

So the image is 0.253 inches behind the lens, which is 20 inches in front of the lens.

So the image is 20 - 0.253 = 19.747 inches in front of the bulb.

But the options don't include this; thus, perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the ball bearing is acting as a mirror, and the object is the bulb, which is 20 inches in front of the mirror.

So using the mirror formula, 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

f = -0.25 inches.

u = 20 inches.

1/v = 1/f - 1/u = (-4) - 0.05 = -4.05.

v = 1/(-4.05) ≈ -0.2469 inches.

So the image is 0.2469 inches behind the mirror, which is 20 inches away from the bulb.

So the distance from the bulb to the image is 20 + 0.2469 = 20.2469 inches.

But the options don't have this. The options are all in inches, but E is 0.25 inches, which is the image's distance from the mirror.

Wait, but the question is about the image's location relative to the ball bearing. So the answer should be E: 0.25 inches behind the ball bearing.

Wait, but the image is 0.2469 inches behind the mirror, so that's approximately 0.25 inches behind the mirror. But the ball bearing is 20 inches away from the bulb, which is 20 inches from the bulb.

Wait, but the image is located 0.2469 inches behind the mirror, which is 20 inches away from the bulb. So the distance from the bulb to the image is 20 + 0.2469 ≈ 20.2469 inches. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mirror formula incorrectly, and the image is on the same side as the object, which would require the focal length to be negative and the image distance to be negative.

Wait, let me try that. If u = 20 inches, and v = -0.2469 inches, then 1/v = -4.05, which leads to 1/f = 1/v - 1/u = -4.05 - 0.05 = -4.1 inches.

But that would give f = -1/4.1 ≈ -0.2439 inches, which is a positive focal length. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mirror formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think: the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

We have u = 20 inches, v = ?

f = ?

If the image is formed on the same side as the object (v is negative), then 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

But for a convex mirror, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, which is impossible. So perhaps the image is formed behind the mirror, but the mirror is a convex mirror, which would make the image have a positive v.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the image distance.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where u is negative if the object is on the opposite side.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ball bearing as a convex mirror, and the image is formed behind the mirror, which would be 0.2469 inches behind the mirror, which is 20 inches away from the bulb. So the image is 20.2469 inches from the bulb.

But the options don't include this, so perhaps the image is in front of the mirror, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 0.25 inches behind the ball bearing. Because the image is 0.2469 inches behind the mirror, which is approximately 0.25 inches.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the image is on the same side as the object, which would make the image distance negative. But for a convex mirror, the image is virtual and on the opposite side.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E: 0.25 inches behind the ball bearing.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A: 2 inches behind the ball bearing.

Wait, but the image is 0.2469 inches behind the mirror, which is 20 inches away from the bulb. So the distance from the bulb to the image is 20.2469 inches, which is not matching any option.

So perhaps the correct answer is option E: 0.25 inches behind the ball bearing.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with option E.

The problem involves imaging a light bulb using a steel ball bearing as a mirror. The ball bearing is 20 inches away from the bulb. Using the mirror formula, we calculate the image's position relative to the ball bearing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Mirror Formula**:  
   The mirror formula is:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \(u\) is the object distance (positive if on one side, negative if on the other).  
   - \(v\) is the image distance (positive if on the same side as the object, negative if on the opposite side).  
   - \(f\) is the focal length (positive for converging, negative for diverging).

2. **Focal Length of the Ball Bearing**:  
   The ball bearing is a convex mirror, so its focal length is negative.  
   \[
   f = -\frac{R}{2} = -\frac{0.5}{2} = -0.25 \, \text{inches}
   \]

3. **Object Distance**:  
   The object is the light bulb, located 20 inches away from the ball bearing.  
   \[
   u = +20 \, \text{inches}
   \]

4. **Solving for Image Distance (\(v\))**:  
   Substitute \(f\) and \(u\) into the mirror formula:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{-0.25} - \frac{1}{20}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{1}{v} = -4 - 0.05 = -4.05
   \]  
   \[
   v = \frac{1}{-4.05} \approx -0.2469 \, \text{inches}

5. **Interpretation of \(v\)**:  
   The negative value of \(v\) indicates that the image is formed on the opposite side of the mirror. The magnitude, 0.2469 inches, is the distance from the mirror to the image.  

6. **Distance from the Bulb to the Image**:  
   The image is 20 inches away from the bulb and 0.2469 inches behind the mirror. Thus, the total distance from the bulb to the image is:  
   \[
   20 + 0.2469 \approx 20.2469 \, \text{inches}
   \]  
   However, the options provided do not include this value, so we focus on the relative position of the image.

7. **Relative Position of the Image**:  
   The image is 0.2469 inches behind the mirror, which is approximately 0.25 inches behind the mirror. Therefore, the image is **0.25 inches behind the ball bearing**.

### Conclusion:
The image is located **0.25 inches behind the ball bearing**.
