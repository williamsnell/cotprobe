Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about calculating the cost of operating a lamp for 24 hours. The lamp uses 1.0 ampere of current on a 100-volt power line. And the cost of electric energy is $0.50 per kw-hour. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember that power is related to current and voltage. Oh right, power (P) is equal to current (I) multiplied by voltage (V). So P = I * V. That seems correct. So if I plug in the numbers, P would be 1.0 amp * 100 volts. Let me calculate that. 1 times 100 is 100. So the power is 100 watts. Oh wait, wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 100 volts and 1 ampere. Oh wait, 100 volts times 1 ampere is indeed 100 watts. Because power in watts is volts times amps.

But wait, the units are given correctly? The problem says 1.0 amp on a 100-volt line. So yes, I think that's correct. So the lamp's power consumption is 100 watts. But wait, the question asks about operating it for 24 hours. So I need to find the total energy consumed over that time.

Energy (E) is power multiplied by time, right? So E = P * t. But the power is in watts, and time is in hours. Oh wait, 100 watts is the same as 100 joules per second. So when you multiply by hours, you get joules. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert the power to kilowatts because the cost is per kw-hour.

Right, because 100 watts is 0.1 kilowatts. Oh wait, because 1000 watts make a kilo. So 100 watts is 0.1 kw. Alternatively, if I use the original 100 watts, then multiply by 24 hours, that would be 100 * 24 = 2400 watt-hours, but that's not right because 1000 watts is 1 kw. So 100 watts is 0.1 kw.

Wait, let me clarify. 100 W is 0.1 kW. So 100 W * 24 h = 2400 Wh, which is 2.4 kWh. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 100 W is 0.1 kW. So 0.1 * 24 = 2.4. Oh wait, 0.1 * 24 is 2.4. So 2.4 kWh would be the energy consumed.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me double-check. Oh, no, wait, 100 W is 0.1 kW. So 0.1 * 24 is indeed 2.4. So the energy consumed is 2.4 kw-hrs.

But wait, the cost is $0.50 per kw-hour. So multiply 2.4 by $0.50 to get the cost. Let's compute that: 2.4 * 0.5 = 1.2 dollars. Wait, but looking at the options, I see that option G is $1.20. But wait, let me check my steps again.

Wait, hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Let me go through it again. The lamp is using 1.0 amp at 100 volts. So power is 1 * 100 = 100 W, which is correct. So energy is power multiplied by time. So 100 W * 24 hours = 2400 Wh. But 2400 Wh is 2.4 kWh because 1 kWh is 1000 Wh. So yes, 2400 Wh is 2.4 kWh.

Then, the cost is 2.4 multiplied by $0.50 per kWh. So 2.4 * 0.5 = 1.2. So that's $1.20. So the answer should be G: $1.20.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is $1.20. So that's the correct answer.

But wait, another way to think about it: 100 W is 0.1 kW. 0.1 * 24 = 2.4. 2.4 * $0.5 is $1.2. So yes, that's correct.

To determine the cost of operating the lamp for 24 hours, we start by calculating the power consumption using the formula \( P = I \times V \). Here, the current \( I \) is 1.0 A and the voltage \( V \) is 100 V, so:

\[
P = 1.0 \, \text{A} \times 100 \, \text{V} = 100 \, \text{W}.
\]

This power is equivalent to 0.1 kW (since \( 100 \, \text{W} = 0.1 \, \text{kW} \)). The energy consumed over 24 hours is then:

\[
E = P \times t = 0.1 \, \text{kW} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 2.4 \, \text{kW-hr}.
\]

The cost of energy is given as $0.50 per kw-hr. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[
\text{Cost} = 2.4 \, \text{kW-hr} \times \$0.50/\text{kW-hr} = \$1.20.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
