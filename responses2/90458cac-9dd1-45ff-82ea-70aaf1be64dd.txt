Okay, so I have this problem about Radium-226's half-life. The question is asking for the time period during which the material is reduced by one-quarter. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, the half-life is 1620 years. So that means every 1620 years, half of the material decays. If it's reduced by one-quarter, that means three-quarters remain, right? Because 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

Wait no, wait. No, wait. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. If something is reduced by one-quarter, that's a decrease of a quarter, so the remaining is three-quarters. Because 1 minus 1/4 is 3/4. So, we need to find the time it takes for the material to go from 100% to 75%. 

The formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Where N is the remaining amount, N0 the initial, t is time, t_half is the half-life.

In this case, N/N0 = 3/4. So, 3/4 = (1/2)^(t/1620). 

I need to solve for t. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides. ln(3/4) = (t/1620) * ln(1/2). 

Wait, let's see. Let me rearrange the equation. 

ln(3/4) = (t / 1620) * ln(1/2). 

Because ln(1/2) is negative, but when I divide both sides, I can handle that. Let's compute each part.

First, compute ln(3/4). Let me calculate that. 3/4 is 0.75. ln(0.75) is approximately -0.28768.

Then, ln(1/2) is approximately -0.69315.

So plug those in: -0.28768 = (t / 1620) * (-0.69315).

Wait, the negatives will cancel out. So, 0.28768 = (t / 1620) * 0.69315.

Let me solve for t. Multiply both sides by 1620:

t = (0.28768 / 0.69315) * 1620.

Calculating 0.28768 / 0.69315: Let me approximate that. 0.28768 divided by 0.69315 is about 0.415.

Then multiply by 1620: 0.415 * 1620 ≈ 672.3. So, t ≈ 672.3 years.

Looking at the options, option B is 672.4 years. So the answer should be B.

The problem involves finding the time period during which Radium-226 is reduced by one-quarter, meaning three-quarters remain. Using the decay formula and solving for time, the calculation leads to approximately 672.4 years. The correct option is B.

Answer: B
