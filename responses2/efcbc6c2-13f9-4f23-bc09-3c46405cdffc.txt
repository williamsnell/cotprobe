Question:

A land development company was the owner of a400-acre tract of land in the Great Lakes region. Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that "the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. "After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor  land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. "At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?

Options:

A: Easement appurtenant.
B: Fee simple subject to executory limitation.
C: Leasehold estate.
D: Fee simple absolute.
E: Remainder interest.
F: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.
G: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.
H: Fee simple determinable.
I: Life estate pur autre vie.
J: Fee simple defeasible.

Alright, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to property law, so I'll need to take it slow and think carefully.

Okay, the question is about a land development company that owns a 400-acre tract. They developed two subdivisions, each with 150 acres. These plats don't reference each other, but the restrictions were identical. Then, after selling 96 acres (all but four) to a country club, the land development company sells the remaining 50 acres to the country club. The country club deed has specific terms about using the property for a country club and maybe subdividing it again.

So, the country club's interest is what we're looking for. Let's break down the situation.

First, the original land: 400 acres. Two subdivisions, each 150 acres. Each subdivision was created by separate plats with identical restrictions. So, all the restrictions apply to both subdivisions.

The land development company sold 96 acres (150 - 54) to the country club. That leaves 100 acres (400 - 300) to be sold. The country club sells 50 acres. 

The country club deed says:

(1) The property can be used as a country club with various facilities, like golf course, pool, tennis courts, etc. 

(2) It may also be subdivided and re-platted, similar to the eastern development, and then re-contracted to residential use.

(3) The restrictions here are covenants running with the land. If the land development company breaches (like selling too many lots), they can re-enter the estate.

So, when the country club buys land, they're essentially taking a parcel that's subject to these covenants. But they're also selling it, so the land is now theirs, but they have these terms binding them.

Wait, but the original land was owned by the land development company. The land development company sold 96 acres, which leaves 50 to the country club. But the land development company retained title to the 50 acres. So when they sell those 50, do they still have the right to sell, or does the deed take away their title?

No, the country club is selling their own 50 acres. So, the land development company sold 96, but the 50 they're selling are theirs. So their title remains.

Now, the country club's deed has an executory limitation and a condition subsequent. So, the land can be used as a country club, but if it's used for something else, they have to re-enter. That's an executory limitation. Also, the subsequent condition is that they can't sell it until they re-enter. Wait, no, the condition is about not selling it. Or is it about re-entering? Let me think again.

The covenants are that the land is subject to these restrictions. So if the land is used for a country club, the covenants run with the land, meaning the land development company (the owner) is a covenant owner. If they breach, they can re-enter. But in this case, the country club is the one who's selling it, not the land development company. So when the country club sells it, they are the ones who took the property.

Wait, no. The land development company's title is still theirs because they sold 96, but the 50 acres are theirs and now are being sold. So when the country club sells them, they're the ones taking it. So their deed is for their 50 acres. 

So, when the country club sells their 50 acres, the land development company's title is still theirs. So the land development company still owns it, but the country club's deed gives them the right to use it as a country club. But they can't use it for another purpose except as a country club. If they want to sell it, they have to re-enter, meaning they have to allow the land development company to sell it again.

Wait, but the land development company already sold 96 acres to the country club. So the land development company's 50 are now theirs. So when the country club sells their 50, the land development company is still there. So the country club's deed gives them the right to use it as a country club, but if they want to sell it, they have to allow the land development company to sell it again.

So, this seems like a fee simple subject to an executory limitation and a condition subsequent. Because:

- The land can be used for a country club. The restriction runs with the land, meaning the land development company is the covenant owner. If they breach, they can re-enter.

- Additionally, if the use is for something other than the country club, they must re-enter.

Wait, but the country club's deed doesn't say anything about selling; it's about the use. So when they sell their 50, the land development company can still sell them, because that's allowed. But if they choose not to sell, then they have to re-enter. But the country club's deed says that the restrictions run with the land, and the land can be used as a country club. So if they want to use it for another purpose, they have to re-enter.

So, for the country club, the initial land is subject to these restrictions. When they sell their 50, they can use it for a country club, but if they want to use it for another purpose, they have to re-enter. So the land is subject to an executory limitation because they can't use it for another purpose without re-entering. Also, the subsequent condition is that they can't sell it until they re-enter. Wait, no, the subsequent condition is that they can't sell it. Or is it that they can't use it for another purpose without re-entering?

Wait, the land development company's covenants say that they are a covenant owner. So if they breach, they can re-enter. But the country club is the one selling. So perhaps when the country club sells their land, if they use it for another purpose, they have to re-enter, meaning the land development company has to sell it again. But if they decide to keep it, they don't have to.

So, the land is subject to an executory limitation because they can't use it for another purpose except as a country club. That's an executory limitation.

Additionally, when they re-enter, which they must, they can sell it again. So the country club's deed has a condition subsequent that they can't sell it. Wait, no, the condition is that they can only use it as a country club, and if they don't want to use it for that purpose, they have to re-enter. So if they don't use it for a country club, they have to re-enter, meaning they can't sell it. So the condition is that they can't sell it if they don't use it for a country club.

Wait, but the country club's deed says that the property may be subdivided and re-platted as residential. So they can use it for a country club or as a residential subdivision. So when they sell it, they can choose either. But if they choose to use it for something other than a country club, they have to re-enter. So, the land is subject to an executory limitation because they can't use it for another purpose. Additionally, the subsequent condition is that they can't sell it unless they re-enter.

Wait, but the condition is about not selling it. So the country club's deed has two aspects: 

1. They can use it as a country club, which is an executory limitation because if they don't use it for that, they have to re-enter.

2. They can't sell it unless they re-enter, which is a condition subsequent because if they don't use it for a country club, they have to re-enter (thus not being able to sell it).

So, the land is subject to both an executory limitation and a condition subsequent. But wait, the question is about the country club's interest in the 50 acres. So the country club's deed is a fee simple subject to an executory limitation and a condition subsequent. So the answer would be option F: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest and a condition subsequent. Or maybe another option.

Wait, let me think again. The land is subject to the restrictions. So when the country club sells it, they have to re-enter, which would mean that their interest is a fee simple determinable. Because if they choose to re-enter, they can't use it anymore. So they can only use it once, which is a fee simple determinable.

Wait, but the use is restricted to country club or residential subdivision. So if they use it for a country club, they can't sell it unless they re-enter. So their interest is a fee simple determinable because they have a right to use it once, and if they don't use it, they can't use it again. But also, they can't use it for another purpose without re-entering. So the restrictions are both executory and condition subsequent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a fee simple subject to an executory limitation because they can't use it for another purpose without re-entering. And a condition subsequent because they can't sell it unless they re-enter.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the 'restrictions' run with the land. So if the land is used as a country club, the covenant continues. If it's used for a residential subdivision, the covenant also runs. So the country club's deed gives them the right to use it as a country club, which is an executory limitation because they can't use it for another purpose.

At the same time, the country club's deed gives them the right to sell it, but only if they re-enter. So they have a fee simple determinable because they can only use it once, and once they use it, they can't sell it again. So the land is subject to both an executory limitation and a condition subsequent.

But wait, the answer options don't have an option for both. Let's check the options again.

Options:

A: Easement appurtenant.

B: Fee simple subject to executory limitation.

C: Leasehold.

D: Fee simple absolute.

E: Remainder interest.

F: Determinable fee subject to executory interest and condition subsequent.

G: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

H: Fee simple determinable.

I: Life estate.

J: Fee simple defeasible.

So, option F is Determinable fee subject to executory and condition subsequent.

Alternatively, another way to think: the country club's deed gives them the right to use the land as a country club, which is an executory limitation. They can only use it once, so they have a fee simple determinable. But if they don't use it for a country club and instead use it for a residential subdivision, then they have to re-enter. So their interest is subject to both an executory limitation (because they can't use it for another purpose) and a condition subsequent (they can't sell it unless they re-enter). 

Wait, but a fee simple determinable is subject to a condition subsequent, but not necessarily to an executory limitation. Alternatively, perhaps the executory limitation is a separate condition.

So the country club's interest is a fee simple determinable because they can only use it once, and once they use it for a country club, they cannot sell it again. So the executory limitation is a separate condition from the fee simple determinable.

So, the country club's interest is a fee simple determinable, but also subject to an executory limitation. So that would be option F: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest and a condition subsequent.

Alternatively, another way to think: the land is subject to two conditions: 

1. They can use it only as a country club, so if they use it for another purpose, they have to re-enter (condition subsequent).

2. They can only use it once, so if they use it, they can't sell it again (fee simple determinable).

So, the country club's interest is a fee simple determinable, but also subject to a condition subsequent that they can't sell it unless they re-enter. But I'm not sure if the executory limitation is part of the fee simple determinable or is a separate condition.

Wait, the executory limitation is an executory condition, which is a condition that affects the use of the property. It's a subsequent condition, meaning it only comes into play after the property is in use.

The fee simple determinable is a condition that affects the right of use. So yes, the country club's fee is subject to a fee simple determinable (they can only use it once), and they have an executory limitation (they can't use it for another purpose).

So the correct term would be "Determinable fee subject to an executory interest and a condition subsequent." Therefore, the answer is F.
</think>

The country club's interest in the 50 acres is a fee simple determinable, which means they can only use the land once and cannot sell it until they re-enter the estate. Additionally, there is an executory limitation, which means they cannot use the land for any purpose other than a country club until they re-enter the estate. 

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Easement appurtenant**: Incorrect. The country club does not own an easement appurtenant to the land.
- **B: Fee simple subject to executory limitation**: Incorrect. While there is an executory limitation, it is not a fee simple subject to an executory limitation.
- **C: Leasehold estate**: Incorrect. The country club does not have a leasehold interest in the land.
- **D: Fee simple absolute**: Incorrect. The country club does not have absolute ownership.
- **E: Remainder interest**: Incorrect. The country club has a remainder interest in the land, but their deed does not grant this.
- **F: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest and a condition subsequent**: Correct. The country club's interest is a fee simple determinable, and they have an executory limitation that prevents them from using the land for other purposes.
- **G: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent**: Incorrect. The country club's fee is not subject to a condition subsequent in this case.
- **H: Fee simple determinable**: Correct. The country club's fee is a fee simple determinable because they can only use the land once.
- **I: Life estate pur autre vie**: Incorrect. The country club does not have a life estate.
- **J: Fee simple defeasible**: Incorrect. The country club does not have a defeasible fee.

Thus, the country club's interest is best described as a **fee simple determinable subject to an executory interest and a condition subsequent**.
