Okay, so I've got this question here about a woman who did a longitudinal study on herself and found increased retrieval difficulty as she got older. Hmm, I remember hearing something about this from my psychology class. Let me think. 

Wait, the person mentioned is a woman, so it's probably not Freud or Skinner, who are more known for different areas. I think it's about memory, right? Oh, right, Ebbinghaus. He studied memory retention and was into memory experiments. He came up with the concept of forgetting curves, which show how long people remember things over time. The idea is that as you study something, you remember it better, but after a certain point, the forgetting rate increases because you've spent too much time on it.

So the study in question must be about how old age affects memory. The woman found that as she got older, her retrieval difficulty (which I think refers to how hard she needed to retrieve information) increases. That makes sense. So she was probably testing the effect of aging on memory consolidation. Longitudinal studies typically track changes over a period, so this must be a study that looked at her own history and found that as she got older, her memory performance, specifically retrieval, deteriorated.

Now, looking at the options, I need to match her name to the correct person. The options are Watson, Smith, Pavlov, Whitebear, Johnson, Clark, Freud, Skinner, Ebbinghaus, or Blackbird. Since Ebbinghaus is the one I'm thinking of, the answer should be I: Ebbinghaus.

The correct answer is I: Ebbinghaus. She conducted a study on memory that increased retrieval difficulty as she aged, highlighting the impact of aging on memory consolidation.
