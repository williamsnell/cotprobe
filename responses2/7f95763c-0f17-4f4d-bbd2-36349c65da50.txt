Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Hursthouse and his views on moral theories. Hmm, I remember that Hursthouse was a philosopher known for his work on moral philosophy, especially about the nature of moral guidance. The question is about what he says about a specific claim: whether a moral theory that provides clear guidance about what's ought and ought not to be done must be something that any intelligent person could follow.

Let me break it down. The claim in question is that any good moral theory must offer clear guidance—something any ordinary person could actually follow. Hursthouse probably addresses this claim in his work. I think about his stance on the relationship between moral principles and practical action. He was critical of certain views that seemed too prescriptive, suggesting that moral theories might be too vague or unsatisfying because they don't give actionable guidance.

Wait, I recall that Hursthouse didn't accept the idea that every moral theory would allow clear guidance. He might have thought that it's impossible because moral theories often focus on right and wrong without providing actionable steps. Maybe he believed that such theories might not be implementable in practice. Or perhaps he thought that some theories do provide guidance, but not all.

The options are about what he says: whether the claim is true, false, self-contradictory, etc. If the claim is that any good theory must offer clear guidance, Hursthouse might argue against that, saying that it's not necessarily the case. So maybe he thinks the claim is false because not all moral theories meet this criterion. Alternatively, maybe he accepts it but finds it problematic.

Wait, I think Hursthouse was critical of the view that all moral theories would allow clear guidance. He might have thought that some theories are too vague or prescriptive and thus can't be practically applied. So the claim that any good moral theory would provide clear guidance that any person could follow is perhaps false because some theories might not offer actionable guidance.

Wait, but the question is about what he says. Let's think about his main points. In "Moral Theory: A Very Short Introduction," he discusses how moral theories often focus on abstract principles without providing clear actions. For example, a theory might say "rightness is based on virtue" but without giving specific actions to follow. So he might have argued that not all moral theories meet the criteria set by the claim in the question.

So if the claim is that any good theory would give clear guidance that any person could follow, and Hursthouse says the claim is false—that is, it's not the case that all moral theories satisfy this—then the answer would be that his stance is that the claim is false.

Looking at the options:

A: She says the claim is controversial. (If Hursthouse is against it, maybe he's saying it's up for debate.)

B: She says the claim is true. (If he accepts it, I'm not sure.)

C: She says the claim is self-contradictory. (I don't think so.)

D: She says the claim is irrelevant. (I think he's not irrelevant.)

E: She says the claim is self-evident. (I don't think so.)

F: She says the claim is partially true. (Hmm, maybe.)

G: She says the claim is very plausible. (I don't think so.)

H: She says the claim is generally accepted. (Not sure.)

I: She says the claim is implausible. (If he thinks it's not the case, then this might be accurate.)

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Hursthouse's work might have had some strong arguments against the view that all moral theories provide clear guidance. So when the question is about what he says about the claim, I think he would say that the claim is false. So the answer would be that his stance is that the claim is false.

In the options, option E says she says the claim is self-evident. That's not correct. Option I says she says the claim is implausible. If that's what he says, then the answer would be I. But wait, I thought he was against the idea that all moral theories provide clear guidance. So the claim that any good theory would allow clear guidance that any person could follow is self-contradictory or false?

Wait, another thought: I remember reading that Hursthouse discussed the distinction between practical and moral theories. He might have argued that while some moral theories have good consequences, they don't provide actionable guidance. So the claim that any good theory would provide clear guidance is false because it's not the case that any good theory does.

So, the answer would be that he says the claim is false. But let's look at the options. The options for answers are about what he says. So the correct answer is that he says the claim is false. Looking for the option that says he says the claim is false. The options:

E: She says the claim is self-evident.

I: She says the claim is implausible.

Wait, I think Hursthouse actually liked the view that moral theories could be just that—pragmatic but not necessarily inductively justifiable. So the claim that any moral theory would provide clear guidance is false because some moral theories are too vague.

So the answer would be that he says the claim is false, which is not one of the options given. Wait, no, the options are about what he says. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, no, the options are:

A: She says the claim is controversial.

B: She says the claim is true.

C: She says the claim is self-contradictory.

D: She says the claim is irrelevant.

E: She says the claim is self-evident.

F: She says the claim is partially true.

G: She says the claim is very plausible.

H: She says the claim is generally accepted.

I: She says the claim is implausible.

J: She says the claim is self-contradictory? Wait, no, the options are up to J? Or are there J options? Wait, no, looking back, the question lists options up to J, but the user's question only shows up to I in their initial question. Wait, the user provided a list up to I, but in the problem, the options are A to I.

Wait, no, the options are A to I as the user lists.

Wait, no, no, the question itself doesn't include J, so I think the correct answer is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Hursthouse was a proponent of the idea that moral theories could be just as good as practical ones, but not necessarily inductively justified. So he might not accept the claim that any good moral theory would provide clear guidance that any person could follow. Thus, his stance would be that the claim is false. So the answer would be E: She says the claim is self-evident. No, that can't be. Or perhaps the answer is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The claim is that any good theory would give clear guidance. Hursthouse would probably say that this is not true—so the claim is false. So the answer would be that he says the claim is false. But looking at the options, option E says she says the claim is self-evident. Option I says she says the claim is implausible.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think about what I remember about Hursthouse's views. He argued that moral theories can be just as good as practical ones but are not inductively justified. So, for example, a moral theory might be that rightness is based on virtue, but you can't actually act based on that because it's too vague. So, he might not accept the idea that every moral theory would provide clear guidance. Therefore, he would argue that the claim is false, meaning it's not true that any good theory meets the criteria. So, the answer would be that he says the claim is false. But in the options, E says she says the claim is self-evident, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The question is phrased as: What does Hursthouse say about the claim that any adequate action-guiding theory must provide clear guidance about what ought and ought not to be done that any intelligent person could follow?

Wait, Hursthouse might not accept that such theories exist. So the claim that any adequate theory would meet this criterion is false. So the answer would be that he says the claim is false. But looking at the options, the options don't have 'false' as an option. The options are about what he says.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what he actually said. Wait, I think Hursthouse wrote in "Moral Theory" that he didn't accept the view that moral theories must provide clear guidance. So he would say that the claim is false.

But in the options, I don't see 'false', but option I says he says the claim is implausible. Alternatively, perhaps he accepts it but finds it implausible, so the answer is I.

Wait, let me think again. The claim is: any good action-guiding theory must provide clear guidance.

Hursthouse would likely argue that this is not the case because some moral theories are prescriptive and don't allow for clear action guidance. So he would say that the claim is false.

In that case, the answer would be E: She says the claim is self-evident. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the answer would be I: She says the claim is implausible. Because he thinks it's not the case that any good theory would provide clear guidance.

Wait, no, if he says the claim is implausible, that would mean he thinks it's not true that any good theory provides clear guidance. So the answer would be I.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. The options are about what he says. So, the options are about the truth of his statement.

Wait, the question is: What does Hursthouse say about the claim?

So, Hursthouse's position is critical of the claim that any good theory (moral theory) would provide clear guidance. He would argue that it's incorrect, hence the claim is false.

So the answer would be that he says the claim is false. But in the options, E says she says the claim is self-evident. That's not correct. Alternatively, looking for the option that says he says the claim is false, but since that's not present, perhaps the closest is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken and Hursthouse actually accepts that any good theory would provide such guidance. Maybe I'm mixing up the content of his works. Alternatively, perhaps he doesn't accept the claim that any theory would provide clear guidance, so the answer would be that he says the claim is false, but since that's not an option, perhaps he says the claim is implausible.

Wait, I think I should conclude that the correct answer is that he says the claim is false. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps Hursthouse does accept the claim as true. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of some other clues.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: She says the claim is self-evident. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Wait, another approach: Think about the original question from the user. The options are A to I. The correct answer is one of them.

Hursthouse's position: He believed that moral theories can be just as good as practical theories but not inductively justified. So, he would not accept the claim that any good theory provides clear guidance. Therefore, he would say that the claim is false. So, the answer would be E: She says the claim is self-evident. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the exact content of Hursthouse. In "Moral Theory," he writes about the problem of moral action and the relationship between moral theories and practical action. I remember reading that he was critical of the view that all moral theories would allow for clear guidance. So, he would say that the claim is false, meaning not all moral theories meet the criterion.

In that case, the answer would be that he says the claim is false. But the options don't have 'false.' So perhaps the answer is I: She says the claim is implausible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the answer is that he says the claim is false. Wait, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that he says the claim is false, but since the options don't have E, which says she says it's self-evident, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the answer is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just pick the option that says she says the claim is false, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is I. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that he says the claim is implausible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is that the claim is false. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E. Because I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought: The user's initial question is about what Hursthouse says. Let me think of the exact quote from Hursthouse. I think in his work, he might say that the claim is false. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Wait, but I'm more confident in my initial thought that Hursthouse would say the claim is false, but since that's not an option, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: She says the claim is self-evident. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that he says the claim is implausible. So the options: I says she says the claim is implausible.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that he says the claim is false. So looking at the options, I don't see that. So perhaps the answer is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that he says the claim is self-contradictory.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to recall the exact answer. From what I remember, Hursthouse, in his work, would argue against the idea that any moral theory would provide clear guidance. So the claim that any adequate action-guiding theory provides clear guidance is false. So the answer is that she says the claim is false. But in the options, that's not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that she says the claim is implausible. So the answer is I.
</think>

Hursthouse's perspective on the claim that any adequate action-guiding theory would provide clear guidance about what ought and ought not to be done is critical. He argues against the idea that such theories are common or applicable in practice. This means he likely believes the claim is false. However, since the options provided do not include a direct "false" option, the closest interpretation is that he says the claim is implausible.
