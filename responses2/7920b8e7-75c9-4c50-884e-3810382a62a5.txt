Okay, so I've got this economics question here about comparative advantage. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's break it down.

The question says that the US is trading salmon to Peru in exchange for anchovies. Both countries are trading based on relative opportunity costs. I need to figure out what must be true.

First, I remember that comparative advantage is about which country can produce something at a lower opportunity cost. So, each country should specialize in the good where they have the lowest opportunity cost.

The options are about who has which good as comparative advantage.

Option A: Both have comparative advantage in salmon. Hmm, that doesn't make sense unless both are producing salmon, which they're not. They're trading each other. So A can't be correct because each should have their own comparative advantage.

Option B: US has absolute advantage in both. If both have absolute advantage, that means both can produce both goods more efficiently than the other. But why would they trade like that? The US would want to export the good where it's more efficient. So B might not be the right answer because if both have absolute advantage, the US can produce both more, but then why would they trade if they can do both better?

Option C: Both have anchovy comparative advantage. If both are in anchovy, that would mean they're better at that product, but again, they're trading each other. So C doesn't make sense because only one country would have an advantage in anchovy.

Option D: Both have comparative advantage in both. That would mean each has their own advantage in both products, but that seems impossible since they're trading each other. So D isn't right.

Option E: US has CD in salmon, Peru in anchovies. Wait, no. If E says US has CD in salmon, but what about the other? So, for the US to have comparative advantage in salmon, it must be that its opportunity cost of producing salmon is lower than the other's. But the US is trading salmon to Peru, so perhaps the US has a comparative advantage in salmon, and the other way around.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the US has an absolute advantage in salmon. It can produce more salmon than the other country. But if the other country (Peru) has a lower opportunity cost in anchovies, then it makes sense for the US to specialize in salmon, and Peru in anchovies. So E says US has CD in salmon and Peru in anchovies? Wait, no, the way the option is phrased is that the US has CD in salmon, and Peru in anchovies. That doesn't make sense because each country should have its own CD. So E is possibly incorrect in the options.

Wait, no, the options are about the comparative advantage. So the correct option would be one that says, for example, the US has a comparative advantage in salmon, and Peru in anchovies. So looking at the options, option E is US has CD in salmon, and Peru has CD in anchovies. But that's not possible because each country's comparative advantage is their own. So perhaps E is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the options are that E says the US has a comparative advantage in salmon, and Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovies. So then, E is correct.

Wait, the question is asking what must be the case. So if the US is trading salmon to Peru, then the US must have a comparative advantage in salmon. Because the US should specialize in the good where it's more efficient, i.e., where it has the lower opportunity cost.

So the US must have a comparative advantage in salmon, and Peru in anchovies. Therefore, the correct option is E, where the US has CD in salmon and Peru in anchovies. Wait, no, that's not how the options are phrased. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

E: The United States has comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has comparative advantage in anchovy production.

Yes, that's correct. Because each country has their own comparative advantage based on their opportunity costs.

So, the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around determining the comparative advantage between the United States (US) and Peru based on the trade of salmon to Peru in exchange for anchovies. Comparative advantage refers to the ability of a country to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost compared to another country.

- **Option A** is incorrect because it suggests both countries have comparative advantage in salmon production, which is not possible as they trade each other.
- **Option B** is incorrect because both countries having absolute advantage in both products does not explain why they trade. The US would prefer to export the good where it has a lower opportunity cost.
- **Option C** is incorrect because it suggests both countries have comparative advantage in anchovy production, which is not feasible as they specialize in their own good.
- **Option D** is incorrect because both countries cannot have comparative advantage in both products simultaneously.
- **Option E** correctly states that the US has a comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovy production. This is the only scenario that aligns with the trade based on opportunity costs.
