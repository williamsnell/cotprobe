Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer for this question about economics, specifically about the relationship between wage rates and marginal revenue products. Let me start by recalling what I know about the firm's profit maximization.

So, the firm's profit depends on the difference between the revenue from selling the output and the cost of producing that output. Revenue is usually calculated by multiplying the price of the product (P) by the quantity sold (Q), so total revenue (TR) is P*Q. 

Now, the marginal revenue product (MRP) is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more unit of labor. It's calculated by taking the derivative of total revenue with respect to labor, which is MR = dTR/dL. Alternatively, MRP is also equal to the price (P) times the marginal product of labor (MPL), so MRP = P * MPL.

The firm maximizes profit when the marginal revenue (MR) is equal to the marginal cost (MC). Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. So, in the short run, if the firm is hiring labor, it's going to hire until MRP equals the wage rate (W). Because in the short run, the firm can't change all inputs, like capital, so it adjusts labor.

Wait, actually, the key point is that the firm will hire workers until the MRP of labor equals the wage rate. Because when the wage rate is higher than MRP, the firm is paying more than the value it's adding by hiring that worker, so it might want to reduce the number of workers. If MRP is higher than the wage rate, the firm should hire more workers because each additional worker adds more revenue than their cost.

So, the condition for profit maximization is MRP = W. But wait, sometimes I've heard it phrased as MRP equals the wage rate. But what about the case when MRP is greater than the wage rate?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If MRP > W, meaning that each additional worker adds more to revenue than the cost of that worker, the firm should hire more workers. So, the condition for hiring more workers is MRP > W.

But the question is about the basis for the answer. Let's look at the options.

Option A says: P or wage rate of labor > MRP of labor and with one additional unit, W < MRP. Hmm. Wait, this might be mixing the concepts. Because if W is less than MRP, then the firm should hire more workers. But option A says W < MRP, which would mean that MRP is higher than the wage rate, so the firm should hire more. But the option says P or W > MRP? Not sure.

Option B: P or W < MRP and with one additional, W > MRP. Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. If W > MRP, the firm would not want to hire more workers because each additional worker adds less to revenue. So in that case, the MRP would be less than W, hence W > MRP.

Wait, let me rephrase. The correct condition is that the firm should hire workers until MRP equals W. So, if MRP > W, MRP is higher, so the firm should hire more. If MRP < W, the firm should hire fewer workers. 

So, the condition for profit maximization is that MRP equals W. But the question is about the basis for the answer regarding when the firm should hire more or fewer workers.

Wait, the question is asking for the basis for the answer when the firm should hire more workers. So, if MRP > W, the firm should hire more. So the condition is that MRP > W. But the options don't seem to directly state MRP > W. Let me look again.

Option A: P or W > MRP and with one additional, W < MRP. Hmm, that seems to mix things. Option A says that P or W is greater than MRP (so MRP is less than P and W?), and that with an additional unit, W is less than MRP. Wait, that would imply that the new worker's wage is lower than MRP, meaning that the MRP is higher than the wage, so the firm should hire more.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the condition when the firm should hire more workers. That occurs when MRP > W. So the condition is that marginal revenue product is greater than the wage rate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: W < MRP, and P or W > MRP. Hmm, not sure. Wait, option A says P or W > MRP and with one more, W < MRP. Wait, that would mean that MRP is higher than W, so the condition is MRP > W. So, in that case, the firm should hire more workers.

Wait, but option A says: P or W > MRP, and with one more, W < MRP. So when MRP is higher than W, so the first worker has W < MRP, so the condition is that the MRP is greater than W. So the correct condition is MRP > W.

So, the basis is that when MRP is greater than W, the firm should hire more workers.

Looking at the options:

Option A: P or W > MRP and with one additional, W < MRP. So, W < MRP. So MRP > W. So the condition for hiring more is that MRP > W, which is what option A says. So option A is correct.

Wait, but I thought the condition is that MRP equals W for profit maximization. But in reality, the firm will hire until MRP equals W. So, if MRP is greater than W, the firm should hire more. If MRP is less than W, hire fewer.

So, the answer is when MRP > W. So the condition is that MRP is greater than the wage rate.

Looking at the options, option A says W < MRP, which means MRP is greater than W. So the condition is that the MRP is greater than W.

Wait, but let me think again. The correct condition is MRP = W. But the question is about the basis for the answer, so the reason why the firm should hire more is when MRP > W.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly that. Let me look at each option:

Option A: "P or wage rate > MRP and with one additional, W < MRP." So it's saying that P is more than MRP, and with an extra unit, W is less than MRP. Wait, that can't be right. Because if P is more than MRP, that would imply MRP is less than W. Or is P something else?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think about the profit maximization condition again. The firm maximizes profit when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. But in the short run, the marginal cost is the wage rate (W), because the firm can't change the number of capital units, perhaps. So, the profit condition is MRP = W.

So, the correct condition is that MRP equals W. But the options are giving different conditions.

Looking again:

Option A: "P or wage rate of labor > MRP of labor and with one additional unit, W < MRP."

Wait, if P (price) is greater than MRP, that would mean that each additional unit is adding less to revenue than the cost. So, the firm shouldn't hire more workers. So the condition would be that P is less than MRP. But option A says P or W > MRP. Hmm, not making sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me outline the profit maximization.

Profit = TR - TC.

TR = P * Q = P * (A + B*L + C*L^2) â†’ but perhaps thinking in terms of MRP.

Marginal Revenue (MR) = dTR/dL = P * MPL (MR = P * MPL).

Marginal Cost (MC) is the wage rate, W.

Profit is maximized when MR = MC. So P*MPL = W. So MRP = W.

So, the condition is that MRP equals W.

Now, looking at the options, none of them directly state that MRP equals W. The best fit would be when MRP equals W. But the options don't have an option stating that.

Wait, perhaps the options are talking about the case when the firm should hire more workers. That would be when MRP > W. Because if MRP is higher than W, the firm should hire more.

So, when MRP > W. So, the condition is MRP > W.

Looking at the options:

Option A says W < MRP. So W is less than MRP. Thus, the condition is that the MRP is greater than W, which is what the condition for hiring more workers is. So option A's first part is correct.

But the second part of option A says "with one additional unit, W < MRP." Wait, that's redundant. Because W is less than MRP, which is the same as the first part. So the second part is saying that with more workers, W is less than MRP. Not sure why that would be necessary.

Wait, perhaps the option is trying to say that the next worker has W < MRP, so the condition for hiring the additional worker is that W is less than MRP. So the firm should hire the additional worker because W < MRP.

So, the condition for hiring more workers is when W < MRP. So that's the correct condition.

Looking at the options, option A says W < MRP, which is true, and that with one additional, W is less than MRP. So that might be redundant, but perhaps it's a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are talking about the condition when the firm should hire more workers, which is that MRP > W.

Looking at option A: "P or W > MRP" and "with one additional, W < MRP." Hmm, confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's stating that the wage rate is less than MRP, which is the condition for hiring more workers.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because the condition is MRP > W, which is when the firm should hire more workers. So option A's first part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The correct condition is MRP = W. But the options don't have that.

But the question is, the basis for the answer in number 1 is... So the answer options are the basis.

So, the correct condition is MRP > W. Which option says that? Looking at the options:

Option A: "P or wage rate of labor > MRP of labor and with one additional unit, W < MRP." So the first part is P or W > MRP. But if P > MRP, that would mean MRP < W, so the firm should hire fewer workers. So the first part is incorrect for the condition of hiring more workers.

Option B: "P or W < MRP and with one additional, W > MRP." So the first part is P or W < MRP. If P < MRP, then MRP > W, so the condition is met, and the second part says that with an additional worker, W > MRP. But W > MRP would mean the firm should hire fewer workers, which contradicts the second part. So, perhaps the second part is incorrect in the condition.

Option C: total revenue is at a maximum. That's not the condition for profit maximization. Profit is maximized when marginal revenue equals marginal cost, not when total revenue is maximum.

Option D: total output is at a maximum. That's more about production, not profit. So not the condition.

So, none of the options seem to match the condition when MRP equals W or when MRP > W. But if the correct answer is when MRP = W, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the closest is option A.

Wait, perhaps the actual correct condition is MRP equals W, but the options don't have that, so maybe the correct condition is when MRP > W, which is the condition for hiring more workers.

In that case, the correct option would be the one that says "with one additional unit, W < MRP" which is part of the condition for MRP > W.

Looking at the options again:

Option A says "P or W > MRP and with one additional, W < MRP." So the first part would be when P > MRP, which would mean the MRP is less than W. So the first part is incorrect for the condition when MRP > W.

Option B: "P or W < MRP and with one additional, W > MRP." If W > MRP, then the firm should hire fewer workers. So the first part is incorrect for the condition of hiring more.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct condition is MRP = W. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the closest is option A, because it says W < MRP, which is the condition that the firm should hire more, and the second part says with one more, W < MRP, which would be the case because W is less than MRP, so the condition holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's talking about the condition when the firm should hire more, which is that W < MRP. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me summarize:

The firm should hire workers until MRP = W. So the condition is MRP = W. But if the options don't have this, perhaps the condition for hiring more workers is that W < MRP, which is the condition for the firm to hire more. 

Looking at the options, option A says that W is less than MRP, and when an additional worker is hired, W is less than MRP. Hmm, perhaps that's a typo and should be W is greater than MRP. Or perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the correct answer in the textbook.

In the textbook, the rule is that the firm should hire workers when MRP equals W. So the correct condition is that MRP equals W.

But the options don't directly state that. So perhaps the question is about the condition when the firm should hire more, which is when MRP > W. So, the condition is MRP > W, which is when the wage rate is less than MRP.

Looking at option A again: "P or W > MRP and with one additional, W < MRP." So the first part is P or W > MRP. If P > MRP, then MRP < W, so the condition for hiring more workers is not met. So the first part is incorrect.

But the second part says "with one additional unit, W < MRP." So W is less than MRP, meaning the condition for hiring more is met. So, perhaps the correct answer is A because the first part says W > MRP, which would mean the firm should hire fewer workers, but the second part says with an additional, W is less than MRP. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A because the condition is W < MRP, which is the condition for hiring more, and the second part is a restatement of that. So the condition is that with an additional worker, W is less than MRP, which would be correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is probably option A. Because the condition for hiring more workers is when W < MRP, which is the first part of option A, and the second part is just explaining the same condition.
</think>

The question asks for the basis of the answer regarding the condition under which a firm should hire more workers, which is when marginal revenue product (MRP) equals the wage rate (W). Marginal revenue product is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker, calculated as MRP = P * MPL, where P is the price of the output and MPL is the marginal product of labor. The firm maximizes profit when MRP = W.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: "P or wage rate of labor > MRP of labor and with one additional unit, W < MRP."  
   - The first part states that either the price (P) or the wage rate exceeds MRP. If P > MRP, it implies that MRP < W, meaning the firm should hire fewer workers. However, if W < MRP, the firm should hire more workers. The second part states that with one additional worker, W < MRP, which aligns with the condition for hiring more workers. This option correctly identifies the condition for hiring more workers (W < MRP) and explains it.

2. **Option B**: "P or wage rate of labor < MRP of labor and with one additional unit, W > MRP."  
   - The first part states that either P or W is less than MRP. If W > MRP, the firm should hire fewer workers. This contradicts the condition for hiring more workers (W < MRP). The second part states that with one additional worker, W > MRP, which is incorrect. This option is inconsistent with the condition for hiring more workers.

3. **Option C**: "Total revenue is at a maximum."  
   - Total revenue is maximized when marginal revenue equals zero, but this is unrelated to the profit maximization condition (MRP = W). This option is irrelevant.

4. **Option D**: "Total output is at a maximum."  
   - Total output is maximized when marginal product of labor (MPL) is zero, which is not relevant to the profit maximization condition. This option is also irrelevant.

### Conclusion:
The correct condition for hiring more workers is W < MRP. Option A correctly identifies this condition and explains it, making it the best choice.
