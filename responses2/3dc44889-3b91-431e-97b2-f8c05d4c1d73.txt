Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the order of growth of a function T(n). Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The problem states that T(1) is 7, and for any n greater than or equal to 1, T(n+1) is equal to 3n plus T(n). So, T(n) is defined recursively. Hmm, I remember that recursive definitions often can be solved by finding a pattern or perhaps expanding them.

Let me try expanding T(n) for a few small values to see if a pattern emerges.

Starting with T(1) =7.

Then T(2) = 3*1 + T(1) = 3 +7 =10.

T(3) =3*2 + T(2)=6 +10=16.

T(4)=3*3 + T(3)=9+16=25.

Wait a minute, these numbers look familiar. Let's see what these are in terms of n:

n | T(n)
1 |7
2 |10
3 |16
4 |25

Hmm, 7 is 7, 10 is 7+3, 16 is 10+6, 25 is 16+9. The increments are 3,6,9... which are multiples of 3. So the increment between T(n) and T(n-1) is 3(n-1).

So, T(n) = T(n-1) + 3(n-1). That makes sense. So, T(n) is the sum from k=1 to n-1 of 3k, plus T(1). Wait, no, because T(1) is given as 7, but when n=1, T(2) is T(1)+3(1), so in general, T(n) = 7 + 3*(1+2+...+(n-1)).

Wait, the sum 1+2+...+(n-1) is (n-1)n/2. So, T(n) =7 + 3*(n-1)*n/2.

Let me compute that:

T(n) =7 + (3/2)(n^2 -n) = (3/2)n² - (3/2) n +7.

Hmm, that's a quadratic function in terms of n. So, the order of growth would be Θ(n²), right? Because the highest power is n squared.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in expanding? Because the recursive relation is T(n+1) =3n + T(n). So, when I write T(n) in terms of T(n-1), it's T(n) =3(n-1) + T(n-1). So, T(n) = T(1) + sum from k=1 to k=n-1 of 3k.

Which is 7 + 3*(sum from 1 to n-1 of k) =7 + 3*( (n-1)*n )/2.

So yes, that's (3/2)n² - (3/2) n +7. So the dominant term is n squared, so the growth is Θ(n²). Looking at the options, option J is Θ(n²), so that would be the answer.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are from A to H. Option J says Θ(n²). So I think the answer should be J.

The function T(n) is defined recursively with T(1) = 7 and T(n+1) = 3n + T(n). By expanding the recursive relation, we find that T(n) can be expressed as a quadratic function of n. Specifically, T(n) = 7 + 3*(n-1)*n/2, which simplifies to a quadratic growth. Therefore, the order of growth of T(n) is Θ(n²).

Answer: J: Θ(n²)
