Okay, so I need to evaluate the expression −2(x − 3) when x is 2. Hmm, let me think step by step. 

First, I remember that to evaluate an expression, I substitute the given value of x into the expression and then compute it. So here, x is 2, which is straightforward. 

The expression is −2 multiplied by (x − 3). Let me write that out: −2 times (2 − 3). 

Wait, what's inside the parentheses first? Let's compute that part. 2 minus 3 equals negative 1. So now the expression becomes −2 multiplied by −1. 

Oh right, when you multiply two negative numbers, the result is positive. So −2 times −1 is 2. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let's go through it again. 

Substituting x=2: −2(2−3) → (2−3) is −1 → −2 × −1 → which is positive 2. So the result is 2. 

Looking at the options, option F is 2. So that should be the correct answer.

The expression to evaluate is −2(x − 3) when x = 2. 

Substituting x = 2:
−2(2 − 3) = −2(−1) = 2.
