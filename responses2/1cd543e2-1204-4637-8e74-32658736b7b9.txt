Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electrostatic charges on three spheres. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the setup is: there are three identical metal spheres, A, B, and C. Each has a charge: A is Q, B is -Q/4, and C is Q/2. Q is given as 2.00e-14 C. Then, the spheres A and B are fixed in place with a center-to-center separation of d=1.20 meters. Sphere C is touched first to A and then to B, and then removed. The question is, what's the force between A and B after this process?

Wait, I remember that when you touch two identical conducting spheres, the charge gets redistributed equally between them. So for sphere C first touching A, since A is initially Q, and C is Q/2. Oh wait, no, the problem says sphere C is touched first to A, and then to B. Wait, but the initial charges of A and C are Q and Q/2, respectively. So when C touches A, they both will have the average charge?

Wait, if I have two identical spheres, when they touch, the charge is shared equally. So the total charge on A and C combined is Q (A) + Q/2 (C) = 3Q/2. So each would have (3Q/2)/2 = 3Q/4 charge.

Wait, so after touching A and C, both have 3Q/4. Then, sphere C (which now has 3Q/4) is touched to B. Wait, sphere B is initially -Q/4. So the combined charge would be 3Q/4 (from C) + (-Q/4) (from B) = (3Q/4 - Q/4) = Q/2. So each will have Q/4 after the second touch.

Wait, so after all the touches, what's the charge on each sphere?

Let me rephrase:

1. Sphere C is touched to A:
   - A's charge: Q
   - C's charge: Q/2
   - Total: 3Q/2. Split equally: each gets (3Q/2)/2 = 3Q/4.

   Now, A has 3Q/4, C has 3Q/4.

2. Sphere C is then touched to B:
   - B's charge: -Q/4
   - C's charge: 3Q/4
   - Total: 3Q/4 + (-Q/4) = 2Q/4 = Q/2. Split equally: each gets (Q/2)/2 = Q/4.

   So now, after this, B has Q/4, and C has Q/4.

So the final charges are:
- A: 3Q/4
- B: Q/4
- C: Q/4

Wait, but the problem says that sphere C is touched first to A and then to B. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The initial state:

A: Q

B: -Q/4

C: Q/2.

When C touches A, each will have (Q + Q/2)/2 = (3Q/2)/2 = 3Q/4. So C is now 3Q/4, A is 3Q/4.

Then, C (3Q/4) touches B (which is -Q/4).

Combined charge is 3Q/4 + (-Q/4) = 2Q/4 = Q/2. Split equally, so each has Q/4.

So after this, the charges are:

A: 3Q/4

B: Q/4

C: Q/4.

Wait, but the problem says sphere C is touched first to A, then to B, and then removed. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the force between A and B depends on their charges and the separation d. The Coulomb's law formula is F = k * |q1*q2| / d².

Wait, but wait: do I need to consider the distance between A and B? The problem says that the initial separation is d = 1.20 m, and since A and B are fixed in place, I think the force between them after the procedure is determined by their current charges and fixed d.

So let's plug the numbers in. First, Q is 2e-14 C.

Compute the product of A and B's charges: (3Q/4) * (Q/4) = 3Q²/(16).

Multiply by k, which is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Then divide by d squared, which is (1.20)^2 = 1.44 m².

Wait, but wait, let me calculate the numbers step by step.

Compute Q: 2e-14 C.

Compute Q²: (2e-14)^2 = 4e-28 C².

Multiply by 3/16: 3*(4e-28) /16 = 12e-28 /16 = 0.75e-28 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28 = let's compute that.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28 = (8.988 * 0.75) * 1e(9-28) )= 6.741 * 1e-19 = 6.741e-19 N·m²/C² * C²/(m²) or something? Wait, no, wait. The formula is F = k |q1 q2| / d².

So q1 is 3Q/4, q2 is Q/4.

So F = k * (3Q/4) * (Q/4) ) / d².

Let me compute that.

F = [ (8.988e9) * (3*(2e-14)^2) / (4*4) ) ] / (1.20^2 )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

F = k * (3Q/4) * (Q/4) ) / (d)^2.

Let me compute each part.

First, compute the numerator:

(3Q/4) * (Q/4) = 3 Q² / 16.

Q is 2e-14, so Q² is (4e-28).

Multiply by 3: 12e-28.

Divide by 16: 12/16 = 0.75, so 0.75e-28.

Then multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28.

Compute 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28 = 8.988 * 0.75 * 1e(9-28) = 6.741 * 1e-19 = 6.741e-19 N·m²/C² * C²/m²? No, wait, no, the units are correct because F is in Newtons.

Wait, but wait, the actual formula is F = k * |q1 q2| / d².

So let's compute (8.988e9) * (3Q/4) * (Q/4) ) / (d^2).

But perhaps I should compute each step numerically.

Q = 2e-14 C.

So:

3Q/4 = 3 * 2e-14 /4 = 6e-14 /4 = 1.5e-14 C.

Q/4 = 2e-14 /4 = 0.5e-14 C.

So product: 1.5e-14 * 0.5e-14 = (0.75) * 1e-28 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28.

Compute 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28 = 8.988 * 0.75e (9-28) )= 6.741e-19.

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9, and 0.75e-28 is 7.5e-29? Wait, 0.75e-28 is 7.5e-29? No, 0.75 is 7.5e-1. So 0.75e-28 is 7.5e-29.

Wait, let me compute 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28:

8.988 * 0.75 = 6.741.

Exponents: 1e9 * 1e-28 = 1e-19.

So 6.741e-19 N·m²/C² * C² / m²? Wait, but F is in Newtons, so the units would be correct.

Wait, but wait, the formula is F = k |q1 q2| / d².

So q1 is 1.5e-14 C, q2 is 0.5e-14 C.

q1 * q2 = (1.5e-14)(0.5e-14) )= 0.75e-28 C².

So F = (8.988e9) * (0.75e-28) / (1.20^2 )

Compute denominator: 1.20^2 is 1.44.

So F = (8.988e9 * 0.75e-28) / 1.44.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *0.75e-28 = 8.988 * 0.75 * 1e(9-28) )= 6.741e-19.

So F = 6.741e-19 / 1.44 ≈ ?

Compute 6.741 / 1.44 ≈ let's see: 1.44 *4.7 = 6.816. Hmm, wait:

1.44 *4.7 → 1.44 *4 =5.76; 1.44*0.7=1.008 → total 6.768.

Hmm, 6.741 is a bit less than 6.768, so approximate 4.7.

So 4.7e-19 N? Wait, but wait, I'm getting 4.7e-19. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 6.741e-19 divided by 1.44.

Compute 6,741 / 1440.

Wait, 1440 * 4 = 5760.

6741 -5760 = 981.

So 4 + (981/1440).

981 divided by 1440: 981 ÷ 1440 ≈ 0.68125.

So total is 4.68125e-19.

Wait but wait, 6.741e-19 / 1.44 = approximately 4.68e-19 N.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.68e-19 N. So that's one of the choices.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh wait, wait. Did I miscalculate the product of the charges?

Let me recheck the charges after the process.

After the process:

Sphere A has 3Q/4 = (3*(2e-14))/4 = 6e-14/4=1.5e-14 C.

Sphere B has Q/4 = (2e-14)/4=0.5e-14 C.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that when C touched A, each gets 3Q/4. Then when C (3Q/4) touches B, which is -Q/4, so the sum is 3Q/4 - Q/4 = 2Q/4 = Q/2. Then each gets Q/4.

So yes, A has 3Q/4, B has Q/4.

So product is (3Q/4)*(Q/4) = 3 Q² /16.

Wait, but in the calculation, I used Q as 2e-14. So 3*(2e-14)^2 = 3*(4e-28) =12e-28, divided by 16 gives 0.75e-28.

So yes, that part is correct.

So F = (8.988e9 * 0.75e-28 ) / (1.44) → 6.741e-19 /1.44 → approx 4.68e-19 N.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4.68e-19 N. But wait, the options are:

A: 2.50e-19

B:7.35e-19

C:4.68e-19

D:5.97e-19

E:5.80e-19

F:8.14e-19

G:6.42e-19

H:3.20e-19

I:9.81e-19

J:1.56e-19

So option C is 4.68e-19, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait a moment. Another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the order of touching.

Wait, when sphere C is touched first to A, then to B. So the initial state is A: Q, B: -Q/4, C: Q/2.

1. C touches A: each gets (Q + Q/2)/2 = (3Q/2)/2 = 3Q/4.

So now A and C are each 3Q/4.

2. Then C touches B. C is 3Q/4, B is -Q/4. Sum is 3Q/4 - Q/4 = Q/2. So each will have (Q/2)/2 = Q/4.

So sphere B ends up with Q/4, sphere A with 3Q/4.

So the force between A and B is F = k |(3Q/4)(Q/4)| / d².

Which is (8.988e9) * (3Q^2 / 16) / d².

Q is 2e-14, so Q² is 4e-28.

Thus, 3*4e-28 /16 = 12e-28 /16 = 0.75e-28.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 7.5e-29 → 8.988e9 *7.5e-29 = 8.988 *7.5 * 1e(9-29) = 67.41 *1e-20 → 6.741e-19.

Wait, no, wait: 8.988e9 *7.5e-29 = (8.988 *7.5) * 1e(9-29) )= 67.41 *1e-20 → 6.741e-19.

Wait, no, 8.988e9 *7.5e-29 = (8.988 *7.5) * 1e(9-29) )= 67.41 * 1e-20 → 6.741e-19.

Divided by d^2 (1.44): 6.741e-19 /1.44 ≈ 4.68e-19 N.

So that's option C.

But wait, looking at the options again, option B is 7.35e-19, C is 4.68e-19, and so on.

So the correct answer should be option C: 4.68e-19 N.

Wait, but the initial calculation, based on the step-by-step, gives F ≈4.68e-19 N, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the charges and forces between the three spheres after the specified sequence of operations. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Initial Charges**:  
   - Sphere A: \( Q = 2.00 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{C} \)  
   - Sphere B: \( -Q/4 = -2.00 \times 10^{-14}/4 = -5.00 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{C} \)  
   - Sphere C: \( Q/2 = 2.00 \times 10^{-14}/2 = 1.00 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{C} \)

2. **Sphere C Touches Sphere A**:  
   When two identical conducting spheres touch, their charges are equally shared.  
   - Total charge on A and C: \( Q + Q/2 = 3Q/2 \)  
   - Each sphere (A and C) now has:  
     \[
     \frac{3Q/2}{2} = \frac{3Q}{4} = \frac{3(2.00 \times 10^{-14})}{4} = 1.50 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{C}.
     \]

3. **Sphere C Touches Sphere B**:  
   Sphere C (now \( 1.50 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{C} \)) touches Sphere B (initial charge \( -5.00 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{C} \)).  
   - Total charge on C and B: \( 1.50 \times 10^{-14} + (-5.00 \times 10^{-15}) = 1.00 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{C} \)  
   - Each sphere (C and B) now has:  
     \[
     \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-14}}{2} = 5.00 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{C}.
     \]
   - Final charges:  
     - Sphere A: \( 1.50 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{C} \)  
     - Sphere B: \( 5.00 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{C} \)  
     - Sphere C: \( 5.00 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{C} \).

4. **Force Between Spheres A and B**:  
   Using Coulomb's law:  
   \[
   F = \frac{k |q_A q_B|}{d^2},
   \]
   where:  
   - \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)  
   - \( d = 1.20 \, \text{m} \)  
   - \( q_A = 1.50 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{C} \)  
   - \( q_B = 5.00 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{C} \)  

   Compute the product of charges:  
   \[
   q_A q_B = (1.50 \times 10^{-14})(5.00 \times 10^{-15}) = 7.50 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{C}^2.
   \]

   Compute \( F \):  
   \[
   F = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(7.50 \times 10^{-29})}{(1.20)^2}.
   \]
   - Numerator:  
     \[
     (8.988 \times 7.50) \times 10^{9 - 29} = 67.41 \times 10^{-20} = 6.741 \times 10^{-19}.
     \]
   - Denominator:  
     \[
     (1.20)^2 = 1.44.
     \]
   - Final calculation:  
     \[
     F = \frac{6.741 \times 10^{-19}}{1.44} \approx 4.68 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{N}.
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated force \( F \approx 4.68 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{N} \) matches option **C**.

ANSWER: C
