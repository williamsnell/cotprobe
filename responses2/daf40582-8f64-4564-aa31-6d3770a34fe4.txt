Okay, so I have this problem here where Lily is giving away all the pieces of candy in a bag, and she can give an equal number to 5, 3, or 2 people. I need to figure out which number of pieces could be in her bag from the given options.

Hmm, let's think. If she can divide the candies equally among 5, 3, or 2 people, that means the total number of candies must be a multiple of each of those numbers. So, the number should be divisible by 5, 3, and 2 without leaving any remainder.

Wait, but 5, 3, and 2 are factors of each other. Like, 5 and 3 are coprime, meaning their least common multiple is 15. Then 15 and 2 are also coprime, so the LCM of all three is 5*3*2=30. So any number that's a multiple of 30 would satisfy this condition.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A:25 – 25 isn't a multiple of 30. Let me check. 25 divided by 5 is 5, so that's fine. 25 divided by 3 is 8 with a remainder of 1, so not divisible by 3. So 25 is out.

B:12 – 12 is divisible by 3 and 2, but 12 divided by 5 is 2.4, which isn't an integer. So 12 isn't divisible by 5, so she can't give equal to 5 people. So B is out.

C:50 – 50 divided by 5 is 10, which is good. 50 divided by 3 is 16 with a remainder of 2, so not divisible by 3. So 50 is out.

D:35 – 35 divided by 5 is 7. Good for 5. 35 divided by 3 is 11.666..., which isn't an integer. So 35 isn't divisible by 3, so she can't give to 3 people. So D is out.

E:45 – 45 divided by 5 is 9, that's fine. 45 divided by 3 is 15, so that's good. 45 divided by 2 is 22.5, which isn't an integer. Oh, wait, so 45 is divisible by 5 and 3 but not by 2. So she can give to 5 and 3 people, but not 2. So E isn't a possible answer because she can't equally distribute to 2 people.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake here? Because the problem says she can give to 5, 3, or 2 people. So if she can give to 5, 3, and 2, then the number must be divisible by all three. So 45 is divisible by 5 and 3, but not by 2. So E is out.

F:30 – 30 divided by 5 is 6, which is fine. 30 divided by 3 is 10, okay. 30 divided by 2 is 15, which is also fine. So 30 is a multiple of 5, 3, and 2. So F is a possible answer.

G:20 – 20 divided by 5 is 4, good. Divided by 3 is about 6.666, so not an integer. Divided by 2 is 10, which is okay. But since it's not divisible by 3, 20 is out.

H:15 – 15 divided by 5 is 3, okay. Divided by 3 is 5, good. Divided by 2 is 7.5, which isn't an integer. So 15 is out because she can't give to 2 people.

I:40 – 40 divided by 5 is 8, good. Divided by 3 is 13.333, so not an integer. Divided by 2 is 20, which is fine. But since it's not divisible by 3, she can't give to 3 people. So I is out.

J:55 – 55 divided by 5 is 11, so that's fine. 55 divided by 3 is around 18.333, which isn't an integer. 55 divided by 2 is 27.5, which also isn't an integer. So 55 isn't divisible by 3 or 2, meaning she can't give to those groups. So J is out.

So the only number that's divisible by 5, 3, and 2 is 30. So the answer is F.

The only number that is a multiple of 5, 3, and 2 is 30. Therefore, the correct answer is F.

Answer: F
