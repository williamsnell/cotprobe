Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where x_1 is 1 and each subsequent term is defined by x_{n+1} = sqrt(3 + 2x_n). The question is asking about the limit of x_n as n approaches infinity, assuming it converges. The options are A through J, with various square roots and numbers.

Hmm, since the sequence is defined recursively and it's given that it converges, I remember that if a sequence converges, then the limit must satisfy the recursive formula. So, let's denote the limit as L. That means as n becomes very large, x_n and x_{n+1} both approach L. So substituting into the equation: 

L = sqrt(3 + 2L)

That's because x_{n+1} is the square root of (3 plus 2 times x_n), and if both sides approach L, I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. 

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root. So,

L² = 3 + 2L

Now, I'll rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation. Subtracting 3 and 2L from both sides gives:

L² - 2L - 3 = 0

Hmm, quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula. The standard form is ax² + bx + c = 0, so here, a is 1, b is -2, and c is -3. The quadratic formula is L = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a).

Plugging in the values: 

Discriminant D = (-2)² - 4*(1)*(-3) = 4 + 12 = 16. The square root of 16 is 4.

So, L = [2 ± 4]/2.

This gives two solutions:

L = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3

and

L = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1

Wait, but limits are about the behavior of the sequence. Since each term is defined as a square root, which is always non-negative, the terms x_n are non-negative. So, a limit must also be non-negative. Therefore, L can't be -1. So, L must be 3.

Looking back at the options, option C is 3. So the answer should be C.

The sequence is defined recursively and converges, so the limit L satisfies L = sqrt(3 + 2L). Squaring both sides gives L² = 3 + 2L, which rearranges to L² - 2L - 3 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation gives L = 3 or L = -1, but since L must be non-negative, L = 3.

Answer: C: 3
