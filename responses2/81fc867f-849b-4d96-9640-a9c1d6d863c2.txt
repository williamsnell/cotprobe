Okay, so I need to construct a truth table for this argument and determine if it's valid or invalid. The argument given is:

(G ≡ H) · ~I
~G ∨ (~H ∨ I) / G

Wait, actually, looking at the structure, it's a bit unclear. The argument has two premises and a conclusion. Let me write it down properly.

The premises are:
1. (G ≡ H) · ~I
2. ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)

And the conclusion is:
G

I think the structure is that the conclusion is G, and the premises are those two. So the argument is: If (G ≡ H and not I), and (~G or not H or I), then G.

To check if this is a valid argument, I need to see if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's a scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

So I should create a truth table with all possible truth values for G, H, I. Since there are three variables, there will be 2^3 = 8 rows.

Let me list the columns: G, H, I, then the premises, and the conclusion.

Wait, I might have to break down each premise.

First, the premise (G ≡ H) · ~I. The equivalence (G ≡ H) is true only when G and H are both true or both false. So ~I is the opposite of I.

The second premise is ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I). Let me see: ~G is true when G is false. ~H ∨ I is true if either H is false or I is true. So putting it together, the second premise is true unless both ~G and (H is true and I is false).

So I need to compute for each row whether both premises are true. Then, if the conclusion G is false, the argument is invalid.

Let me build the table step by step.

First, list all possible combinations of G, H, I.

1. G=T, H=T, I=T
2. G=T, H=T, I=F
3. G=T, H=F, I=T
4. G=T, H=F, I=F
5. G=F, H=T, I=T
6. G=F, H=T, I=F
7. G=F, H=F, I=T
8. G=F, H=F, I=F

Now, evaluate each premise for each row.

Premise 1: (G ≡ H) · ~I

For each row, compute G ≡ H (which is G equals H), and then multiply by ~I.

Row 1: G=T, H=T → G≡H=T. ~I=F. So Premise1 = T & F = F.
Row 2: G=T, H=T → G≡H=T. I=F → ~I=T. So Premise1 = T & T = T.
Row3: G=T, H=F → G≡H=F. I=T → ~I=F. Premise1=F & F=F.
Row4: G=T, H=F → F. I=F → ~I=T. Premise1=F & T=F.
Row5: G=F, H=T → F. I=T → ~I=F. Premise1=F & F=F.
Row6: G=F, H=T → F. I=F → ~I=T. Premise1=F & T=F.
Row7: G=F, H=F → G=H=T. I=T → ~I=F. Premise1=T & F=F.
Row8: G=F, H=F → T. I=F → ~I=T. Premise1=T & T=T.

Now, evaluate Premise2: ~G ∨ (~H ∨ I)

For each row, compute ~G, ~H, and I.

Row1: ~G=F, ~H=F, I=T. So ~H ∨ I is F ∨ T = T. So Premise2 = F ∨ T = T.
Row2: ~G=F, ~H=F, I=F. So ~H ∨ I=F ∨ F=F. Premise2=F ∨ F=F.
Row3: ~G=F, ~H=T, I=T. ~H ∨ I=T ∨ T=T. Premise2=F ∨ T=T.
Row4: ~G=F, ~H=T, I=F. So ~H ∨ I=T ∨ F=T. Premise2=F ∨ T=T.
Row5: ~G=T, ~H=F, I=T. ~H ∨ I=F ∨ T=T. Premise2=T ∨ T=T.
Row6: ~G=T, ~H=F, I=F. ~H ∨ I=F ∨ F=F. Premise2=T ∨ F=T.
Row7: ~G=T, ~H=T, I=T. ~H ∨ I=T ∨ T=T. Premise2=T ∨ T=T.
Row8: ~G=T, ~H=T, I=F. Same as row7. Premise2=T.

Wait, let me double-check each row's evaluation.

Wait, perhaps I made some mistakes. Let me recheck each premise evaluation.

Let me go through each row again.

Row1: G=T, H=T, I=T.

Premise1: (G≡H)=T, ~I=F. So T & F = F.

Premise2: ~G=F, ~H=F, I=T. So ~H ∨ I is F ∨ T=T. So Premise2 is T ∨ T=T.

So Premise2 is T. So for Premise1: F (Premise1 is F), Premise2=T.

Row1: Premise1= F, Premise2= T.

Conclusion is G= T.

So in row1, Premise1 is F, so the argument's premise is (F and T) → F. So the entire argument is (F) → T, which is T (since an implication A→B is only false when A is true and B is false). So in row1, the argument is valid? Because if the premises are true, the conclusion is true.

Wait, but let's proceed.

Row2: G=T, H=T, I=F.

Premise1: (T=T)=T, ~I=T. So T & T=T.

Premise2: ~G=F, ~H=F, I=F. So ~H ∨ I is F ∨ F=F. So Premise2=F ∨ F=F.

So here, Premise1=T, Premise2=F.

So the argument's premise is T and F → T (since (T and F) is F, which makes the entire premise F. So the argument's overall is F→G=T. So F→T is T.

Row2: overall, the premises are F → T, which is valid.

Row3: G=T, H=F, I=T.

Premise1: (G≡H)=F, ~I=F. So F & F=F.

Premise2: ~G=F, ~H=T, I=T. ~H ∨ I=T ∨ T=T. So Premise2=T ∨ T=T.

So premises are F and T → F→T is T.

Row4: G=T, H=F, I=F.

Premise1: (F), ~I=T → F & T=F.

Premise2: ~G=F, ~H=T, I=F. So ~H ∨ I=T ∨ F=T. So Premise2=T.

Premises are F and T → F→T=T.

Row5: G=F, H=T, I=T.

Premise1: (F≡T)=F, ~I=F. So F & F=F.

Premise2: ~G=T, ~H=F, I=T. So ~H ∨ I=F ∨ T=T. So Premise2=T.

Premise1=F, premise2=T → F→T is T.

Row6: G=F, H=T, I=F.

Premise1: (F≡T)=F, ~I=T. So F & T=F.

Premise2: ~G=T, ~H=F, I=F. So ~H ∨ I=F ∨ F=F. So Premise2=F.

So premises: F and F → F→G=F. So F→F is T.

Row7: G=F, H=F, I=T.

Premise1: (F≡F)=T, ~I=F. So T & F=F.

Premise2: ~G=T, ~H=T, I=T. So ~H ∨ I=T ∨ T=T. Premise2=T.

So premises: F and T → F→T=T.

Row8: G=F, H=F, I=F.

Premise1: T, ~I=T → T & T=T.

Premise2: ~G=T, ~H=T, I=F. So ~H ∨ I=T ∨ F=T.

So premises: T and T → T→T=T.

Now, putting this all together, the premises are all true only in some rows. Let's see where the premises are true and the conclusion is true.

Wait, the conclusion is G, which is true in rows where G is T.

In which of the rows is G=T and both premises are true?

Looking at each row:

Row1: G=T. Premise1=F, Premise2=T. So conclusion is T, but premises are F. So the argument is (F and T) → T. So F→T is T. So the argument is valid in this row because the premise is F, so the implication is T.

Wait, but if the premise is F, the implication is always T, regardless of the conclusion. So in all rows where the premise is true, the conclusion must be true for the argument to be valid.

So let's look for rows where both premises are true. Let me see:

Which rows have both premises true?

Looking at each row's premises:

Row2: Premise1=T, Premise2=F. So premise is T (Premise1 is T, premise2 is F → T and F is F). So overall, premise is F → argument is T.

Row3: Premise1=F, premise2=T → premise is F → argument is T.

Row4: Premise1=T, premise2=T → premise is T → argument is T.

Row5: Premise1=F, premise2=T → premise is F → argument is T.

Row6: Premise1=F, premise2=F → premise is F → argument is T.

Row7: Premise1=F, premise2=T → premise is F → argument is T.

Row8: Premise1=T, premise2=T → premise is T → argument is T.

So the only row where the premises are all true (both premises are T) is row4: G=T, H=F, I=F.

In this row, the conclusion G=T is also true. So in this case, the argument is valid, because whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

Wait, but wait—does the argument have premises that are only true in row4? Let me check.

Wait, in row4, the premises are (T & T) → T. So premises are true, conclusion is true.

In other rows, if premises are true, conclusion is true.

So all rows where premises are true, the conclusion is also true. So the argument is valid.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I didn't miss any rows where the premises are both T.

Looking again:

Row4: G=T, H=F, I=F. So G=T. So the premises are (G≡H)=T, and ~I=T (since I=F). So both premises are T. Conclusion is G=T. So the argument is (T and T) → T, which is T.

Is there any other row where both premises are T?

Looking at the other rows:

Row7: G=F, H=F, I=T.

Premise1: (F≡F)=T, ~I=T (since I=T → ~I=F). So premise1=T & F=F.

So in row7, the premises are F → premise is F, so the argument is T.

No, no. Wait, in row7:

G=T, H=F, I=T.

Premise1: (G≡H) → T, ~I=T (since I=T → ~I=F). So Premise1=T & F=F.

So the premises are F → the argument is T.

So the only row where both premises are T is row4.

So in row4, the premises are T, and the conclusion is T. So the argument is valid.

Wait, but let me think again. Because in row4, the premises are both true, and the conclusion is true. So in all other scenarios where premises are true, the conclusion is also true, which is required for the argument to be valid.

So the argument is valid.

Looking at the options, option D says "Valid. No counterexample exists." So the correct answer would be D.

But wait, let me see if any other rows have premises true and conclusion false. Like, is there any row where premises are true and G is false?

Looking through the rows:

Row1: G=T. Premise1=F → no.
Row2: G=T, premises F and T → no.
Row3: G=T, premises F and T → no.
Row4: G=T, premises T and T → yes, conclusion T.
Row5: G=F, premises F and T → no.
Row6: G=F, premises F and F → no.
Row7: G=F, premises F and T → no.
Row8: G=F, premises T and T → no.

So no row where premises are true and conclusion is false. So the argument is valid.
</think>

The argument is valid because in all rows where the premises are true, the conclusion (G) is also true. There are no counterexamples where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Answer: D
