Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this finance question. Let's see, the question is about calculating the price someone would pay for a security. The details given are the maturity value is $100,000, the coupon rate is 4%, and the yield required is 8%. The security is due in 5 years. 

Hmm, right, so I remember that the price of a bond or security is essentially the present value of its future cash flows. The cash flows here would be the coupon payments plus the maturity value. 

Let me break it down. The coupon rate is 4%, so each year, the security gives a coupon payment of 4% of $100,000, which is $4,000 per year. Since it's due in 5 years, there are 5 such payments. Then, at the end of 5 years, there's also the $100,000 maturity value.

Now, the yield required is 8%. Yield here is the yield to maturity, which means it's the discount rate we're using to calculate the present value of all the cash flows. So, I need to calculate the present value of the 5 coupon payments plus the $100,000, all discounted at 8%.

Wait, the formula for the present value of an annuity (the coupon payments) is PV = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r. And then add the present value of the maturity value, which is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. 

Let me plug in the numbers. The coupon payment C is $4,000, the rate r is 8% or 0.08, and the number of periods n is 5. 

First, calculate the present value of the coupon payments. 

PV_coupons = 4000 * [1 - (1 + 0.08)^-5 ] / 0.08.

Let me compute that step by step. (1 + 0.08) is 1.08. (1.08)^-5 is 1/(1.08)^5. Let me calculate that. 1.08^5 is approximately 1.469328. So 1 divided by that is about 0.680583. 

So 1 - 0.680583 is 0.319417. Then, dividing by 0.08: 0.319417 / 0.08 is approximately 3.9927125. Multiply by 4000 gives 4000 * 3.9927125 ≈ 15,970.85.

Wait, let me double-check that. 4000 * 3.9927125. 3.9927125 * 4000 is 15,970.85.

Now, the present value of the maturity value is 100,000 / (1.08)^5. Earlier, we found (1.08)^5 is about 1.469328. So 100,000 / 1.469328 ≈ 68,058.30. Because 100,000 / 1.469328 is approximately that. 

So the total price someone would pay is the sum of the two present values: 15,970.85 + 68,058.30 = 84,029.15. Let me round that to the nearest dollar, which is $84,029.15. 

Looking at the options, option C is $84,028.82, which is very close. Option B is $75,000, which is way lower. Option G is $78,500. So I think the correct answer is C.

To determine the price a buyer would pay for the security, we calculate the present value of the future cash flows. The security has a maturity value of $100,000, a coupon rate of 4% (annual payment of $4,000), and a yield to maturity of 8%. The cash flows include annual coupon payments of $4,000 for 5 years and a final payment of $100,000 at the end of year 5.

The present value of the coupon payments is calculated using the present value of an annuity formula:

\[
PV_{\text{coupons}} = 4000 \times \frac{1 - (1 + 0.08)^{-5}}{0.08}
\]

\[
PV_{\text{coupons}} = 4000 \times \frac{1 - 0.680583}{0.08} = 4000 \times 3.9927125 \approx 15,970.85
\]

The present value of the maturity value is calculated as:

\[
PV_{\text{maturity}} = \frac{100,000}{(1 + 0.08)^5} = \frac{100,000}{1.469328} \approx 68,058.30
\]

Adding both present values gives the total price:

\[
Total\ Price = 15,970.85 + 68,058.30 \approx 84,029.15
\]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the price is approximately $84,028.82, which matches option C.
