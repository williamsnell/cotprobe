Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the real interest rate. Hmm, I need to figure it out. Let me think about what I remember from my economics class.

The real interest rate is the rate of interest adjusted for inflation, right? It's the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Wait, or is it the other way around? I think the formula is something like real interest rate equals nominal interest rate minus inflation rate. Let me make sure I got that right.

Looking at the options: Option E says "the nominal interest rate minus anticipated inflation." That sounds familiar. Another option is D, which is "the anticipated inflation rate minus the nominal interest rate." Oh wait, that's the negative of E. So I need to be careful with the order.

Wait, no, correct formula is real rate = nominal rate - inflation rate. So real interest rate = (1 + nominal rate) / (1 + inflation rate) - 1. But for small rates, the approximate formula is real rate â‰ˆ nominal rate - inflation rate. So yes, it's real rate = nominal rate - inflation rate.

So looking at the options, E is "the nominal interest rate minus anticipated inflation." That fits. But wait, some sources might present it as real rate = nominal rate - expected inflation. So E is correct.

Other options: 
- A: Anticipated inflation plus nominal. That doesn't make sense. Real rate should be less, not higher.
- B: Multiplying rates doesn't give a real rate. Real rate is a rate, so multiplying would be incorrect.
- C and others: These seem more about nominal rates. How about if someone thought real rate is nominal minus expected inflation, but maybe looking at literature, some say real rate is nominal minus expected inflation. So E is correct.

So the correct answer should be E.

The real interest rate is calculated as the nominal interest rate minus the anticipated inflation rate. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Answer: E
