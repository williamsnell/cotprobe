Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the density of sulfuric acid. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly. The question says that the density of concentrated sulfuric acid is 1.85 g/ml. I need to find out what volume of the acid would weigh 74.0 grams. The options are A to J, each with different volumes.

Hmm, density is mass over volume, right? So the formula I remember is density = mass / volume. So if I rearrange that, volume equals mass divided by density. Oh wait, right, because density (d) is mass (m) divided by volume (v), so solving for v gives v = m/d. That makes sense because if the density is high, the volume is small for the same mass.

Given the mass is 74.0 grams, and the density is 1.85 g/ml. Let me plug in the numbers. So v = 74.0 g / 1.85 g/ml. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, 74 divided by 1.85. Let me think, 1.85 times 40 is 74 because 1.85 times 40 is 74. Because 1.85 * 40 = 74. Oh wait, because 1.85 * 40 = (1.85 * 4) *10 = 7.4 *10 =74. So 74 /1.85 equals 40. So the volume is 40.0 ml.

Looking at the options, option J is 40.0 ml. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any calculation mistakes? Let me compute 74 divided by 1.85 again. 1.85 times 40 is 74. So yes, 40. So the volume is 40 ml, which is option J.

To determine the volume of concentrated sulfuric acid that weighs 74.0 g, we use the formula for density: 

\[
\text{density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{volume} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{density}}
\]

Given:
- Mass = 74.0 g
- Density = 1.85 g/ml

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\text{volume} = \frac{74.0 \, \text{g}}{1.85 \, \text{g/ml}} = 40.0 \, \text{ml}
\]

Thus, the volume of the acid is 40.0 ml. The correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
