Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the theoretical air-fuel ratio for octane burning. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stoichiometry, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question gives the combustion equation: C8H18 + 12.5 O2 + 12.5(3.76)N2 = 8CO2 + 9H2O + 47 N2. Wait, that looks a bit complicated. Oh wait, the 12.5(3.76) part—oh, I think that's maybe a typo or a mistake. Let me check. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a coefficient. Oh, wait, maybe that's an error and the correct coefficient is 12.5 for both O2 and N2. Because usually, the stoichiometric ratios are given. So let's proceed.

The question is asking for the theoretical air-fuel ratio. The options are in grams of air per gram of fuel. So I need to find how much air is consumed per the amount of fuel, which is octane in this case.

Wait, the theoretical air is 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen by volume. No, wait, in reality, the air is about 21% O2 and 79% N2. So that's the air composition. So the question is about the amount of air relative to the amount of fuel (octane) required for complete combustion.

First, let's understand the formula of the equation. The left side is octane plus oxygen and another gas (N2). The right side is products: CO2, H2O, and N2.

But wait, the way the equation is written, the fuel is being combined with oxygen and another gas, which isn't typically part of combustion. Oh, perhaps this is a typo, but let's proceed. Maybe the N2 is part of the air composition. The theoretical air is 21% O2 and 79% N2 by volume (or mass, but assuming it's volume for this problem). So the air is 21% O2 and 79% N2, making up 100% (assuming it's ideal gas and no other components).

So, to find the air-fuel ratio, I need to find how much air is consumed per the amount of fuel (C8H18) that's being burned. 

The standard approach is to find the stoichiometric amounts of O2 and N2 required, then compute the amount of air based on the O2 and N2 in the air. But since the equation includes both O2 and N2 as reactants, perhaps we have to account for both or perhaps the N2 is part of the air. Wait, the problem states the theoretical air is 21% O2 and 79% N2. So that means the air is a mixture of O2 and N2, but in the equation, we have both as reactants. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is considering that the air is made up of O2 and N2 in those proportions. So maybe the equation's reactants are O2 (in 21%) and N2 (79%), and the products are CO2, H2O, and N2. But that's a bit confusing because the N2 is on both sides.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the amount of air needed relative to the amount of fuel. So let's see: The stoichiometric air is 21% O2 and 79% N2. So the ratio of O2 to N2 in the air is 21:79. 

In the equation, the fuel is 1 mole, and the air is 12.5 moles of O2 and 12.5*(3.76) moles of N2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 12.5 multiplied by 3.76 is 47. That's a lot more than 12.5. So perhaps the given equation is a typo. Maybe the 12.5 is for O2 and N2 each. Let me recompute that.

Wait, the equation is written as C8H18 + 12.5 O2 + 12.5*(3.76) N2 = 8 CO2 + 9 H2O +47 N2. Hmm, that might mean that the coefficient for N2 is 12.5 *3.76, which is about 47. So the equation is:

C8H18 + 12.5 O2 + 47 N2 = 8 CO2 + 9 H2O +47 N2

Wait, but that would imply that 47 moles of N2 are present on both sides, so that part cancels out. That can't be right. So maybe that's a mistake. So perhaps the correct coefficient is 12.5 (for O2) and 12.5 (for N2), since 12.5+12.5=25, which is a bit more than the 100% air. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is 12.5 for each O2 and N2.

But maybe that's not the main point. Let's proceed.

So the theoretical air is 21% O2 and 79% N2. So for every mole of air, 0.21 moles is O2, and 0.79 moles is N2.

The combustion equation gives us the moles of each product. The fuel (C8H18) is 1 mole.

In the products, the N2 is 47 moles, but in the reactants, the N2 is 47 as well (if the equation is as written). So perhaps the N2 is on both sides, so it's balanced. So that part doesn't affect the ratio.

So the ratio of O2 to N2 in the air is 21:79.

Wait, but the available O2 and N2 in the air for the reaction are 12.5 O2 and 47 N2. So the ratio is 12.5 O2 :47 N2 = 25 O2 :94 N2. Hmm, but wait, 12.5 and 47 are both multiplied by 12.5. So perhaps that's a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written with 12.5 O2 and 12.5 N2, but that's not matching the products' N2.

Wait, perhaps the equation is correct as written, but I'm getting confused because the N2 on the reactant side is 47 moles. But in the products, the N2 is also 47. So perhaps the N2 cancels out when writing the ratio. So the only relevant parts are O2. 

Wait, but O2 is 12.5 moles in the reactant side. The air has 21% O2, so the amount of O2 in the air is 0.21 * total air.

But wait, the problem is to find the air-fuel ratio, which is (moles of air) / (moles of fuel) in the ratio of their stoichiometric amounts.

Wait, no. Air is a mixture of O2 and N2; the question is about the amount of air consumed relative to the amount of fuel burned. So, for the theoretical air-fuel ratio, we need to find how much air (as per its composition) is consumed per the amount of fuel (C8H18) that is burned.

So, the approach is to find the amount of O2 and N2 in the air that are consumed, and then compute the air's amount based on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the oxygen in the air is used up in the combustion, but since it's not part of the products, maybe it's a helping factor here.

Wait, another approach: in the combustion reaction, the oxygen is consumed, but in the air, it's part of the mixture. So the amount of oxygen consumed is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction, but the air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the moles of O2 and N2 in the air that are consumed. Since the stoichiometric air is 21% O2 and 79% N2, the total moles of air would be moles of O2 plus moles of N2.

Wait, but if the air is 21% O2 and 79% N2, then for every mole of air, 0.21 moles is O2 and 0.79 is N2. But in the combustion equation, the O2 is 12.5 moles. So perhaps the air has a total of 12.5 moles of O2 and 47 moles of N2, which is 59.5 moles total. The ratio of O2 to N2 is 12.5:47, which is about 1:3.76. Wait, but how does that relate to the theoretical air-fuel ratio?

Alternatively, perhaps the theoretical air is the amount of O2 and N2 that would be needed if all the O2 and N2 in the air were consumed. But in the equation, the O2 and N2 are part of the reactants. So perhaps the question is about using the air as a reactant, but then the products include more N2, so perhaps the equation is written incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the equation was intended to have O2 and N2 (air) as reactants, and the products include CO2, H2O, and some N2 as well. So the equation is:

C8H18 + a O2 + b N2 → products.

But the given equation is:

C8H18 + 12.5 O2 + 12.5*(3.76) N2 = ... but that's 47 N2, which will cancel with the N2 on the product side.

Wait, no, in the products, there's 47 N2 as well. So the N2 on the reactant side is 47, same as in the products. So the N2 doesn't affect the ratio because it's on both sides. So perhaps the equation is actually missing the N2 on the product side. Or perhaps that's a typo. Wait, the given equation is:

C8H18 + 12.5 O2 + 12.5*(3.76) N2 = 8 CO2 + 9 H2O +47 N2.

Wait, so O2 is 12.5, N2 is 47. So the products have 47 N2. So the N2 in reactant side is 47, and in products, 47. So that part's balanced. But the O2 is 12.5, which is on the reactant side, and in the products, 8 CO2 which doesn't have O2. Wait, no, the products have O2 in CO2? No, wait, CO2 is a product. So let's see: 8 CO2, so 8 moles of O2 used. Because each CO2 has one O2.

Wait, in the equation, the O2 is 12.5 on the reactant side. But in the products, 8 CO2 is formed, which uses 8 O2. So 8 O2 is consumed. But in the equation, O2 is 12.5. So that leaves 12.5 -8 =4.5 O2 unreacted. That's a problem because we're supposed to have a complete combustion.

This suggests that perhaps the given equation is not correctly balanced. So this is a problem because the way it's written doesn't make sense for a complete combustion reaction.

Wait, perhaps the given equation is written in a way that the reactants are O2 and N2, but the products include CO2, H2O, and N2. So the equation is:

C8H18 + 12.5 O2 + 47 N2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O + 47 N2.

Because 8 CO2 requires 8 O2, and O2 comes from the reactant. So let's check:

Reactant O2: 12.5.

Products: 8 CO2 → 8 O2 consumed.

So O2 used is 8, leaving 4.5 in the reactant.

But the N2 on reactant side is 47, which is the same as the product N2. So the N2 is balanced.

But wait, the problem statement says the combustion equation is as given, so perhaps it's correct, but I'm missing something. Let me think. Maybe the O2 in the reactant is 12.5, but only 8 are used, so 4.5 is unused. But that would imply that the equation isn't balanced, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm. This suggests that perhaps the equation provided is incorrect, but as per the user's question, it's given, so I'll proceed.

So, the question is to find the theoretical air-fuel ratio.

The theoretical air is 21% O2 and 79% N2 by volume (or mass, assuming it's volume-based). So, for every mole of air, 21% is O2 and 79% is N2.

The combustion equation is:

C8H18 + 12.5 O2 + 47 N2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O + 47 N2.

Wait, but the O2 in the reactant is 12.5, and O2 is 8 in products. So the O2 used is 8, leaving 4.5 unreacted, which would imply that the equation isn't balanced as written. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem setup, but perhaps I should proceed with the given equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written with the reactants as O2 and N2, but the products are CO2, H2O, and N2. So, perhaps the O2 used is 8, leaving 12.5 -8 =4.5 O2 unreacted. But this seems odd, but perhaps the problem is presented that way.

But perhaps that's a typo in the problem, but for the sake of the problem, I'll proceed with the given equation.

So, the theoretical air is 21% O2 and 79% N2. So, for 1 mole of air,

moles of O2 in air = 0.21 * (total moles of air) 

moles of N2 in air = 0.79 * (total moles of air)

In the reaction, the O2 is 12.5 moles, and the N2 is 47 moles.

Wait, but the O2 in the reactant is 12.5, but in the products, only 8 are consumed. So, perhaps not all the air is being consumed, but that's a problem because the question is about the theoretical air-fuel ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the amount of air consumed per the amount of fuel, but considering that O2 and N2 are in the air, but the equation has them as reactants. So, perhaps the process is:

The theoretical air is 21% O2 and 79% N2.

But the O2 and N2 in the air are consumed in the combustion reaction. But in the given equation, O2 is 12.5, N2 is 47.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the amount of air based on the O2 and N2 in the reaction.

Wait, the reaction equation shows:

1 mole of C8H18 + 12.5 O2 +47 N2 → 8 CO2 +9 H2O +47 N2.

Wait, but the N2 is on both sides. So let's rearrange the equation to find the O2 required.

The equation is:

C8H18 + 12.5 O2 → 8 CO2 +9 H2O.

Because the N2 on both sides cancels out.

So, the moles of O2 needed is 8 per mole of C8H18.

So, for 1 mole of fuel, 8 moles of O2 are consumed.

So, the air that's consumed is 8 O2 + something else? Wait, no. Because air is O2 and N2. So, O2 used is 8, but the air has O2 and N2. So the amount of air consumed would be based on the ratio of O2 to N2 in the air.

Wait, but the problem is to find the air-fuel ratio, which is how much air is consumed per the amount of fuel burned.

So, for 1 mole of fuel, 8 moles of O2 are consumed.

But the air is 21% O2 and 79% N2.

So, the moles of air consumed would be:

moles of air = (moles of O2 used) / (fraction of O2 in air) + (moles of N2 used) / (fraction of N2 in air)

But in the reaction, the O2 used is 8, and the N2 used is 0, because the balanced equation only uses O2.

Wait, no. The balanced equation as per the given is:

1 mole fuel → 8 moles O2 used.

But the O2 is from the air. So, the air must supply 8 moles of O2, and the rest of the air is N2.

So, the amount of air consumed is moles of O2 (8) / (21% or 0.21) ) + moles of N2 (0) / (0.79).

Wait, but the moles of N2 used would be 0 because the products have 47 N2, same as reactant.

So:

moles of air consumed = (8 / 0.21) ) + (0 / 0.79 )

= (8 / 0.21) ) = approx 38.095 moles.

So, per mole of fuel, 38.095 moles of air are consumed.

But wait, the air is a mixture of O2 and N2, so another approach is:

The theoretical air is 21% O2 and 79% N2. So, for any amount of air, the moles of O2 is 0.21 * moles_air, and moles_N2 is 0.79 * moles_air.

The combustion reaction is 1 mole C8H18 → 8 moles O2.

So, given that, the moles of O2 used is 8.

So, 8 = 0.21 * moles_air.

So, moles_air = 8 / 0.21 ≈ 38.095.

Then, the moles of N2 in air is 0.79 * 38.095 ≈ 30.08.

So, the moles of air consumed is 38.095, the moles of N2 in air is 30.08, and the moles of N2 in products is 47. But wait, the N2 in products is same as in reactant, so perhaps that's not affecting the ratio.

But wait, the N2 in the air is 30.08, which is part of the air. So the air is 38.095 moles, which is 38.095 = 30.08 + 8.

Wait, but that's just the sum.

But the question is, for the theoretical air, which is 21% O2 and 79% N2, what is the amount of air consumed per the amount of fuel burned (1 mole).

So, the calculation I did earlier, moles_air = 38.095, which is 8 /0.21.

So, the air-fuel ratio is 38.095 :1.

But the question asks for the ratio of air to fuel. So the theoretical air-fuel ratio is 38.095:1.

Wait, but that's for 1 mole of fuel. So, for 1 mole of fuel, the air consumed is 38.095 moles.

But wait, the air is 38.095 moles, which includes 8 moles of O2 and 30.08 moles of N2. But the N2 in the air is 30.08, same as what's in the air.

But wait, the N2 in the air is part of the air, but the N2 in the products is the same, so perhaps that's not relevant for the ratio.

Wait, but the N2 in the air is 30.08, and the O2 is 8. So, the air has a total of 38.095 moles, which is O2 + N2.

But the problem is to find the amount of air consumed per the amount of fuel (1 mole). So, the air consumed is 38.095 moles per the fuel.

So, the air-fuel ratio is 38.095 : 1.

But let's check the given equation again. Because the equation provided is 12.5 O2 and 47 N2, but in the products, it's 8 CO2, 9 H2O, and 47 N2. So, the O2 used is 8, leaving 12.5 -8 =4.5 O2 unreacted, which can't be right because the equation is supposed to be completely balanced.

So, perhaps the given equation is incorrect, but as per the question, I'll proceed.

So, for 1 mole of fuel, 8 moles of O2 are used, leaving 4.5 moles of O2 unreacted. But that can't be right because the equation is not balanced. So, perhaps the given equation is correct, but I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written incorrectly, but if I proceed, I'll compute the air-fuel ratio based on the given equation.

In the given equation, 1 mole of fuel uses 12.5 moles of O2 and 47 moles of N2. The products include 8 moles of CO2, 9 moles of H2O, and 47 moles of N2. So, for the equation to be balanced, the O2 used must be 8, and the O2 left is 4.5, which is a problem.

So, perhaps the reaction is not balanced as written, which would make the problem invalid. So, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the reaction is balanced, but I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written correctly, but I'm misunderstanding the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the given equation is:

C8H18 +12.5 O2 +47 N2 → 8 CO2 +9 H2O +47 N2.

But in this equation, the N2 on both sides is 47. So, the reaction is balanced for O2 and N2. But O2 is 12.5 on the reactant side, and 8 on the product side. So, that's a problem because 12.5 -8 =4.5 O2 unreacted, which is impossible.

So, perhaps the equation is incorrect, and thus, I can't proceed. But I have to, so perhaps I'll proceed under the assumption that the equation is balanced, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the air-fuel ratio in terms of the given equation.

In the given equation, 1 mole of fuel requires 12.5 moles of O2 and 47 moles of N2.

But in reality, according to the reaction, 12.5 O2 is consumed, but the air is 21% O2 and 79% N2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moles of O2 and N2 in the air, and then relate them to the O2 used.

But I'm getting stuck because the given equation is not balanced.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the amount of air, in terms of moles, that is required for the combustion of 1 mole of fuel.

The air is 21% O2 and 79% N2.

In the combustion reaction, the O2 is consumed as 12.5 moles per fuel, but that's not correct because the equation isn't balanced.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the moles of O2 and N2 in the air, and then relate them to the O2 used in the reaction.

Wait, the reaction is 1 fuel → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O +47 N2.

So, for 1 mole of fuel, 8 moles of O2 are consumed.

So, the moles of O2 in the air is 8, and the moles of N2 in the air is 47.

Wait, but in the air, the N2 is 47 moles, and O2 is 8 moles, but the total moles of air would be 8 +47=55.

But the problem is to find the air-fuel ratio, which is (moles of air) : (moles of fuel).

Wait, no. The air-fuel ratio is the amount of air consumed per the amount of fuel burned. So, for 1 mole of fuel, 8 moles of O2 are consumed.

So, the moles of air consumed is 8 (O2) + (47/0.79) (N2), because the N2 in the air is 47, and 0.79 is the fraction of N2 in the air. So, the moles of N2 in the air are 47 /0.79 ≈60. So, 8 +60=68 moles of air consumed for 1 mole of fuel.

So, the air-fuel ratio is 68:1.

Wait, but that's if the O2 and N2 are consumed in the reaction. But in the given equation, O2 is 12.5, which is more than the 8 required.

So, perhaps the given equation is incorrect, but I'll proceed.

So, the air-fuel ratio is 68:1, which is about 68 times more air than fuel. So, the theoretical air-fuel ratio would be 68:1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I should account for the fact that the O2 and N2 in the air are not all consumed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the air-fuel ratio based on the given equation.

In the given equation, 1 mole of fuel requires 12.5 moles of O2 and 47 moles of N2.

So, the moles of O2 in the air is 12.5, and the moles of N2 in the air is 47.

But in the air, the N2 is 47, and the O2 is 12.5.

The ratio of O2 to N2 in the air is 12.5 :47, which is roughly 0.263, or 26.3%.

But the question is about the air-fuel ratio, which is the amount of air consumed per the amount of fuel burned.

So, for 1 mole of fuel, 12.5 moles of O2 are consumed.

The moles of air consumed is (12.5 / 0.21) ) + (47 / 0.79 ), because the O2 in the air is 0.21 * air_moles, and the N2 in the air is 0.79 * air_moles.

So, moles of air consumed = (12.5 /0.21) ) + (47 / 0.79 )

= approx 60. (12.5 /0.21=60. )) 47 /0.79≈60.

So, 60 +60=120.

So, the air-fuel ratio is 120:1.

Hmm, but earlier calculation was 68:1. So, why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps the problem is that, in the given equation, the O2 and N2 are present in the air, but they are not all consumed. So, the air-fuel ratio is based on the amount of O2 and N2 in the air, not the amount used in the reaction.

So, for 1 mole of fuel, the air consumed is 12.5 O2 and 47 N2. The oxygen and nitrogen in the air are 0.21 * air_moles and 0.79 * air_moles.

So, for 12.5 O2 in the air, the air_moles is 12.5 /0.21 ≈60.

For 47 N2 in the air, the air_moles is 47 /0.79 ≈60.

So, the air consumed is 60 +60=120 moles.

So, the theoretical air-fuel ratio is 120:1.

But wait, the problem says the combustion equation is as given, but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the air-fuel ratio based on the given equation, not the balanced equation.

So, in the given equation, 1 mole of fuel uses 12.5 moles of O2 and 47 moles of N2.

So, the oxygen and nitrogen in the air are 0.21 * air_moles =12.5 → air_moles=12.5 /0.21≈60.

Similarly, 0.79 * air_moles=47 → air_moles=47 /0.79≈60.

So, the air consumed is 60 +60=120.

Thus, the air-fuel ratio is 120:1.

But wait, in that case, the answer is 120:1, which is option E.

But earlier, another approach gave me 68:1.

So, which approach is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is the one that uses the given equation, where the O2 and N2 in the air are 12.5 and 47, respectively.

So, the air consumed is 12.5 /0.21 + 47 /0.79 = approx 60 +60=120.

Thus, the air-fuel ratio is 120:1.

So, the correct answer is E: 120.
</think>

The theoretical air-fuel ratio is calculated by considering the amount of oxygen and nitrogen in the air and how much of the air is consumed per the amount of fuel burned.

1. **Air Composition**:  
   - Oxygen (O₂) is 21% of air.  
   - Nitrogen (N₂) is 79% of air.  

2. **Air-Moles Calculation**:  
   - For 12.5 moles of O₂ in the air:  
     \[
     \text{Air}_\text{moles} = \frac{12.5}{0.21} \approx 60 \text{ moles}.
     \]
   - For 47 moles of N₂ in the air:  
     \[
     \text{Air}_\text{moles} = \frac{47}{0.79} \approx 60 \text{ moles}.
     \]
   - Total air consumed:  
     \[
     60 + 60 = 120 \text{ moles}.
     \]

3. **Air-Fuel Ratio**:  
   The ratio of air to fuel is the total air consumed per the amount of fuel burned.  
   \[
   \text{Air-Fuel Ratio} = \frac{120 \text{ moles air}}{1 \text{ mole fuel}} = 120:1.
   \]

ANSWER: E) 120.
