Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contracts and what doesn't terminate them by operation of law. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which of the options doesn't terminate a contract when it's in operation. Remember, when a contract is in operation, it means it's ongoing and active, and it's subject to various terminations.

The options are A through G, with H being the last option. I need to figure out which one doesn't cause the contract to terminate under common legal principles.

First, let me recall the basics of contract law.Contracts, unless otherwise terminated, are binding and enforceable. They can be terminated by a few factors. The options given are all possible ways a contract could be terminated.

Option A: Change in law making the contract impossible. Well, I think if the law changes and the contract can't be performed anymore, that would terminate it. Like if a law requires a default or something, the contract might be impossible. So this is a possible termination.

Option B: Bankruptcy of one party. If one party's claim against the other is bankrupt, the contract might be terminated because one party can't fulfill their obligations. For example, if a supplier is bankrupt, they can't pay what they owe. So this would terminate the contract.

Option C: Expired term. If the contract's duration ends, that's a clear termination. Like a lease expiring or a contract that's set to last only a few months. So C is a termination.

Option D: Partial performance. Partial performance is when one party partially fulfills the contract. Like sometimes, if one side doesn't fully pay or completes the work, the other might have to make up. But does that terminate the contract? I think partial performance doesn't terminate the contract; it's more about the obligations. So D might not terminate.

Option E: Supervening illegality. Wait, this is a bit tricky. If the law itself is illegal, does that directly terminate the contract? I'm not sure. The contract is in operation, so if the law is illegal, the subject matter is not enforceable. But does that mean the contract is terminated? Or does the contract just fail to meet the enforceability criteria? Maybe it's more that the contract's performance is impossible, but I'm not certain. I'll come back to this.

Option F: Death or insanity of a party. If a party dies or is insane, does that terminate the contract? I'm not sure. I think death would cause the other party's legal capacity to be in question. If someone is dead, they can't perform, so the other party might have to fulfill the contract on their own. But this is a possibility, not a termination. So F might not terminate it.

Option G: Fulfillment of contract. Obviously, fulfilling the contract is the main performance, but the contract is ongoing. Fulfilling it would mean the contract is completed, so no termination there.

Option H: Destruction of the subject matter of the contract. If the contract's terms are destroyed, meaning the subject matter doesn't exist anymore, the contract can't be performed, so it would terminate. Like if the contract became voidable or something, so H would terminate.

Wait, let me think again about option E: Supervening illegality. So if the law is illegal, and the contract is in operation, does that mean the contract can't be performed? Or does it just mean that the contract can't be enforced because the law is illegal? I think if the law itself is illegal, the subject matter is not enforceable, so the contract can't be performed, so it would terminate. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's more that the contract is subject to an invalidation rather than termination. I'm a bit confused here.

Another angle: What are the main terminations that cause a contract to end? The main ones are:
- Change in law making contract impossible (A)
- Bankruptcy of a party (B)
- Expired term (C)
- Partial performance (D)
- Death/insanity of a party (F)
- Destruction of the subject matter (H)
- Supervening illegality (E)
- Fulfillment (G)

Wait, but partial performance (D) doesn't terminate the contract. It's about the obligations, not the performance. So D is not a termination.

So the options that do not terminate the contract are A, B, C, D, F, and E? Or wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, the question is which will NOT terminate a contract. So the ones that don't cause the contract to end are the answer.

Wait, the question is asking which will NOT terminate it. So the options are which ones are not terminations.

The options are A to G. The answer is the one that doesn't terminate.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list each option and what happens.

A: Change in law makes contract impossible → yes, contract ends.

B: One party bankrupt → contract can't perform (so contract ends).

C: Term expired → yes.

D: Partial performance → no termination.

E: Supervening illegality → I think that's when the law itself is illegal, so the contract can't be performed, so ends.

F: Party dead or insane → can't perform, so ends.

G: Contract fulfilled → yes, contract ends.

H: Subject matter destroyed → contract can't be performed, so ends.

Wait, so the only option that doesn't terminate is the one that doesn't cause the contract to end. So the question is which does not terminate. So the options that don't terminate are the ones that don't cause the contract to end.

Wait, no: the question is asking which does not terminate. So the options that are not terminations.

Wait, let me think. The question is, which of the options does NOT terminate a contract. So the answer is the one that doesn't cause the contract to end.

Looking back at each option:

A: Change in law makes contract impossible → yes, ends.

B: Bankruptcy → ends.

C: Term expired → ends.

D: Partial performance → no, contract doesn't end.

E: Supervening illegality → I'm not sure. If the law is illegal, does that mean the contract can't be performed? Or does it just mean the contract is invalid? If the law is illegal, perhaps the contract is subject to invalidation, but doesn't necessarily end. Alternatively, if the law is illegal, the contract can't be enforced, but the contract is still in operation. Wait, maybe E is a scenario that doesn't terminate the contract.

F: Death or insanity → contract can't be performed, ends.

G: Fulfillment → ends.

H: Subject matter destroyed → ends.

So the options that do NOT terminate are: A, B, C, D, F, H.

The options that do terminate are D, E, G.

Wait, wait, no. Let me make sure I'm getting this right.

Wait, E: Supervening illegality. So the contract's performance is impossible. So does that mean the contract can't be performed, thus ending? Or does it just mean it's illegal, so the contract is unenforceable, but the contract is still in effect.

I think that the contract is in operation, but if the law is illegal, the contract can't be performed. So it would terminate. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, if the contract is in operation and the law is illegal, the subject matter is not enforceable, so the contract can't be performed, so it ends. So E would terminate.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. I might have to think again. For example, if a contract is in operation, and a law is illegal, the contract can't be performed because the law would prevent it. So yes, it would terminate.

So the options that do not terminate would be the ones that don't cause the contract to end. Looking back, the options are:

E: Supervening illegality.

Wait, if the court decides that the contract is illegal, then the contract can't be performed. So E does terminate.

Wait, but the question is which will NOT terminate.

So all options except D, E, G, etc. But wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the question is: Which of the following will not terminate a contract by operation of law?

So, looking for the option that does not terminate a contract in operation.

So, which of the options is not a cause of termination.

So, the options are:

A: Change in law makes contract impossible → yes, ends.

B: Bankruptcy → ends.

C: Term expired → ends.

D: Partial performance → no, ends.

E: Supervening illegality → ends? Or not? If the law is illegal, maybe the contract can't be fulfilled, so ends.

F: Death or insanity → ends.

G: Fulfillment → ends.

H: Subject matter destroyed → ends.

Wait, but I'm getting this wrong because some options are more about performance than termination.

Wait, another approach: The options are about what causes a contract to terminate, not what doesn't. So, for each option, does it cause termination?

The question is which does NOT terminate.

So the options that do not cause termination are the ones that don't stop the contract from being performed.

So:

A: Makes contract impossible → yes, ends.

B: One party's claim becomes invalid → ends.

C: Term ends → ends.

D: Partial performance → no.

E: Law is illegal → ends.

F: Party dead → ends.

G: Contract fulfilled → ends.

H: Subject matter destroyed → ends.

So the only option that doesn't lead to termination is none of them. But that's not the case. Wait, no. The question is which does not. So the options that don't cause termination are those that don't stop the contract.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think: The question is which does not terminate. So the options that are not causes of termination.

Wait, no. The question is asking which will NOT terminate. So the correct answer is the option that doesn't cause the contract to end.

Wait, perhaps E is the answer. Let me think again.

Wait, E: Supervening illegality. If the law is illegal, the contract can't be performed because the law would prevent it. So yes, that would terminate the contract.

So, all options except one do not terminate. Which is the correct one?

Wait, maybe D: Partial performance is the one that doesn't terminate. Because partial performance is when one party only partially fulfills, but the other still has to perform. So D would not terminate the contract.

Wait, but wait, let me think. Partial performance means that the contract is in progress but not completed. So for example, a supplier only pays part of their bill. The other party must pay the rest. So the contract hasn't been fully completed, so it's not terminated. It's still ongoing.

So D is a reason for the contract not to terminate.

Wait, so the options that don't terminate are those that don't cause the contract to end. So which of the options is not a cause of termination?

Looking at the options:

A: Ends

B: Ends

C: Ends

D: No

E: End

F: End

G: End

H: End

So the only option that doesn't cause termination is... Wait, but none of the options don't cause termination. That can't be, because the question must have an answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about E. Let me think again.

If the law is illegal, does that make the contract unsatisfiable? Like, if a contract is in operation, but the law is illegal, does that mean the contract can't be performed? Or is the contract still in effect but just unenforceable.

I think the contract is still in operation but its performance is impossible because the law is illegal. So the contract would terminate because it can no longer be performed, even though it's in operation.

So E would terminate.

Wait, so all options except D? No, that can't be.

Wait, the options are which will not terminate, so the correct answer is the one that doesn't cause the contract to end.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the only one that doesn't cause termination. No, that doesn't make sense because E would cause termination.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the causes of termination. A contract is in operation if it's ongoing. Termination can be due to:

- Change in law making contract impossible (A)

- One party's claim becomes invalid (B)

- Term expired (C)

- Partial performance (D) — no, because it's about performance, not termination.

- Death or insanity (F) — yes, contract can't perform.

- Subject matter destroyed (H) — yes.

- Supreming illegality (E) — which might make the contract's performance impossible, causing termination.

Wait, but I'm not sure about E. Let me think of a scenario: If a contract is in operation, and the law becomes illegal, does that cause the contract to terminate? Or does the contract remain in effect but just can't be performed.

I think it's the latter: the contract is still in effect but can't be performed because the law is illegal. So E would cause termination.

So in that case, all options except one do not terminate. Wait, but the options are given, and the question is which does not.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The question is, which does NOT terminate the contract by operation of law.

So which of the following doesn't cause the contract to end.

Looking back:

Which options are causes of termination:

A: Change in law → ends.

B: Bankruptcy → ends.

C: Term expired → ends.

D: Partial performance → no.

E: Supreming illegality → ends.

F: Death or insanity → ends.

G: Fulfillment → ends.

H: Destruction → ends.

So the only option that doesn't cause termination is D.

Wait, no. No, because D is about partial performance, which doesn't terminate. It's about whether the contract is completed, but not that it's performed.

Wait, but the question is about which does not terminate. So if the contract is in operation, which of these do not cause it to end.

So the options that do not cause termination are:

- A: Ends.

- B: Ends.

- C: Ends.

- D: No.

- E: Ends.

- F: Ends.

- G: Ends.

- H: Ends.

So the only option that doesn't cause termination is D.

Wait, no. Because all the options except D cause termination.

Wait, but the question is which one does not terminate. So the correct answer is the one that doesn't cause termination.

So the options that don't cause termination are the ones that don't stop the contract from being performed. So for example, if a contract is in operation, and the law is such that it makes the contract impossible to perform, that would terminate the contract.

Looking at E, if the law is illegal, the contract can't be performed, so it ends.

So all options except D do cause termination. So the answer is D.

Wait, no. Because the question asks which does not terminate.

So the options that do not cause termination are those that don't stop the contract from being performed. So for example, if the contract's subject matter is destroyed, the contract can't be performed, so it ends.

Wait, but the options are about what causes termination. So the question is, which one does NOT cause termination.

So the answer is the option that doesn't cause termination. So if all options except D cause termination, then D is the one that doesn't. So the correct answer is D.
</think>

To determine which option does not terminate a contract by operation of law, we analyze each choice based on its impact on the contract's performance and whether it prevents the contract from being performed:

1. **A: Change in law that makes contract impossible**  
   This would terminate the contract because the law now makes it impossible to perform.

2. **B: Bankruptcy of one party**  
   If one party is bankrupt, the contract cannot be performed, terminating it.

3. **C: Expired term**  
   A contract with an expired term is terminated.

4. **D: Partial performance**  
   Partial performance refers to one party partially fulfilling the contract, but the contract is still ongoing. This does not terminate the contract.

5. **E: Supervening illegality**  
   If the law is illegal, the contract's performance is impossible, terminating it.

6. **F: Death or insanity of a party**  
   Death or insanity of a party makes the other party unable to fulfill the contract, terminating it.

7. **G: Fulfillment of contract**  
   Completing the contract is the main performance, so this terminates the contract.

8. **H: Destruction of the subject matter of the contract**  
   This makes the contract unenforceable, terminating it.

**Conclusion:**  
The only option that does not terminate the contract is **D: Partial performance**, as it does not prevent the contract from being performed; it merely requires partial fulfillment.
