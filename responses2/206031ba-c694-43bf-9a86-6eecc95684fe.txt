Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the reserve ratio and the Federal Reserve buying Treasury securities. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that the reserve ratio is 10%. The Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks. We're told that money demand is perfectly elastic.

Hmm, I remember that when the Fed buys government securities from banks, it's called an open market operation. That usually increases the money supply because banks now have more reserves. Wait, but how does that affect money demand?

Oh right, money demand is perfectly elastic. That means that if the interest rate drops, money demand increases a lot. But wait, perfect elasticity would mean that money supply increases when the interest rate goes down, right? Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, money demand is perfectly elastic, so if the interest rate falls, the quantity of money demanded increases a lot. So when the Fed buys securities, they are increasing the money supply. Let me think about how that works.

Reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks must keep as reserves. Oh, wait, reserve ratio is 10%, so the Fed buying securities would reduce the amount of reserves banks have. Because they're giving the Fed $1 million, which they take from their reserves.

When the Fed buys these securities, it's like the Fed is injecting more money into the system. Since banks have more reserves, they can lend out more money, increasing the money supply. So the supply of money increases.

Now, with perfectly elastic money demand, when the Fed increases the money supply, this causes the interest rate to drop because more money chasing the same amount of money. Lower interest rate means people save more, leading to higher AD ( Aggregate Demand) because they can afford to save.

Wait, what happens to the AD curve when the interest rate drops? The AD curve shifts to the right because lower rates encourage more spending.

So in this case, the money supply should increase. Let's look at the options.

Option C says "money supply increases by $10 million lowering the interest rate and increasing AD." That makes sense. Because the Fed buys $1 million, but since reserves are reduced by that, the money multiplier comes into play. Wait, no, the money supply increases by the amount of the buy multiplied by the money multiplier. What's the money multiplier? The money multiplier is 1/reserve ratio. So if the reserve ratio is 10%, the money multiplier is 10.

So if the Fed buys $1M, the money supply increases by 10 times that, which is $10 million. So the money supply goes up by $10 million.

But wait, no—when the Fed buys $1M, that's part of the money supply. So the money supply increases by $1M. Oh wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up with the concept.

Wait, the reserve ratio is 10%, meaning that for every dollar deposited, 10 cents must be held as reserves. So when the Fed takes $1M from a bank, the bank's reserves decrease by $1M. Oh wait, no—when the Fed buys the securities, the banks' reserves increase by $1M because the Fed takes that money from their reserves. So the money supply increases by $1M.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The Fed purchases $1M in bonds. So that's money that's now in the economy. So the money supply would increase by $1M. But the reserve ratio is 10%, so each dollar deposited can be lent out 90% of the time. Wait, no—the reserve ratio is 10%, so the bank must keep 10%, so when the Fed buys $1M, that's a loan from the Fed to the bank. So the bank's reserves go up by $1M. Then, the bank can lend out 90% of that, so the money multiplier is 10 (since 1/(0.10) is 10). So the total money supply increases by 10 times the amount of the Fed's purchase.

So if the Fed buys $1M, the money supply increases by $10 million.

Now, since the money supply increases, the interest rate will fall because there's more money chasing the same amount of money. So the interest rate decreases, leading to higher AD (aggregate demand) because people can borrow at lower rates.

So the options are... Looking at the options:

A: Money supply increases by $1M, lowering interest rate and increasing AD. But wait, no, because the money supply is actually $10M, not $1M. Because the reserve ratio is 10%, the money multiplier is 10. So the Fed's $1M purchase leads to more than that in money supply.

Wait, but let me think again. The Fed buys $1M, so that's a new money. So the money supply increases by $1M. But the actual money supply is based on the money multiplier. Wait, no. The money multiplier is 1/(reserve ratio). So if the Fed buys $1M, the money supply increases by $1M multiplied by the money multiplier, which is 10. So the money supply increases by $10 million.

So I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify. The Fed's $1M in the market is a direct injection into the economy. So the money supply immediately increases by $1M. But when the Fed's purchase affects the banks' reserves, since the reserve ratio is 10%, the money supply would actually increase by more due to the multiplier effect.

Wait, no. Let me think of it this way: The Fed buying $1M means that money in the economy increases by $1M. But because the reserve ratio is 10%, each dollar the Fed buys is lent out by banks. The money multiplier is 10, so the money supply increases by $1M * 10 = $10 million.

Alternatively, the Fed's purchase of $1M is a part of the money supply. Then, the banks, with 10% reserves, have 90% of that available for lending. But since the Fed is buying into the economy, the total money supply is increased by 10 times the Fed's injection because of the money multiplier.

So the Fed's $1M leads to a $10M increase in money supply.

In this scenario, since the money supply increases, the interest rate will fall (because more money chasing the same amount of money). Lower interest rate leads to higher AD. So the AD curve shifts right.

Looking back at the options:

Which option states that the money supply increases by $10M, interest rate falls, and AD increases?

Option C says "money supply increases by $10 million lowering the interest rate and increasing AD."

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the money demand is perfectly elastic. So when the Fed increases the money supply, that causes the interest rate to fall, which then increases AD.

So option C would fit.

But wait, let's check another angle. In the initial situation, when the Fed buys the money, the money multiplier applies. So money supply increases by $1M * 10 = $10 million.

So the options:

A: $1M, lowers interest rate, increases AD. But no, because money supply is $10M, so A's first part is wrong.

B: $10M decrease, which doesn't make sense because the Fed is buying money, which increases the supply.

C: $10M, lowers interest rate, increases AD. That's correct.

But wait, another angle: Perfectly elastic money demand. If the Fed increases money supply, the interest rate will fall; that causes AD to increase.

So the correct option is C.
</think>

When the reserve ratio is 10% and the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, this action increases the money supply. The reserve ratio being 10% implies that the money multiplier is 10 (1 / 0.10). Therefore, the $1 million purchased by the Fed results in an increase in the money supply by $10 million.

Since the money demand is perfectly elastic, an increase in the money supply will cause the interest rate to fall. The fall in interest rates will lead to an increase in Aggregate Demand (AD) because people can borrow at lower rates, increasing their spending.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The money supply does not decrease; it increases by $10 million.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The money supply does not decrease; it increases by $10 million.
- **Option C**: Correct. The money supply increases by $10 million, the interest rate falls, and AD increases.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The money supply does not remain constant.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The money supply does increase, so the interest rate does fall.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The money supply increases by $10 million, not $20 million.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The interest rate does fall, not remain constant.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The interest rate does fall, not remain constant.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The money supply does not decrease; it increases.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The money supply does increase, so AD does not remain constant.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**: Money supply increases by $10 million, lowering the interest rate and increasing AD.
