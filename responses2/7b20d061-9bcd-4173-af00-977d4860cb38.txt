Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the net price of a pinball machine. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that the list price is $900, and there's a 25% discount. Hmm, right, so I need to find the amount after the discount is applied.

First, I should calculate what 25% of $900 is. To find a percentage of a number, I multiply the percentage (in decimal form) by the number. So, 25% is 0.25 in decimal. So, 0.25 * 900 = 225. So, the discount is $225.

Now, subtracting that discount from the list price should give me the net price. So, $900 minus $225 equals $675. Let me double-check that math: 900 minus 200 is 700, and then minus another 25 is 675. Yep, that seems right.

Looking at the options provided, option I is $675. So, that must be the correct answer.

The net price is calculated by subtracting 25% of the list price from the list price.

1. **25% of $900**:  
   \( 0.25 \times 900 = 225 \)

2. **Net Price**:  
   \( 900 - 225 = 675 \)

**Answer: I: $675**
