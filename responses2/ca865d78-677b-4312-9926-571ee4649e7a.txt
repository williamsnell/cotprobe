Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. We have a random sample of 16 observations, X1 to X16, taken from a normal distribution with mean 77 and variance 25, so N(77,25). And we need to find the probability that the sample mean, which is X-bar, is between 77 and 79.5. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, alright. So since the original distribution is normal, the sample mean should also be normally distributed. I remember that when dealing with the sample mean, the distribution is normal with mean equal to the population mean and variance equal to the population variance divided by the sample size.

Wait, let me write that down. The population mean is μ =77, variance σ² =25, so the standard deviation σ is 5. The sample size n is 16. So the standard error (standard deviation of the sample mean) would be σ/sqrt(n) = 5/sqrt(16)=5/4=1.25.

So the sampling distribution of the sample mean, X-bar, is N(77, (1.25)^2), but I'll just write it as N(77, 1.25). So X-bar ~ N(77, 1.25).

We need to find P(77 < X-bar < 79.5). To find this probability, we can standardize X-bar to a Z-score.

The Z-score formula is (X - μ)/σ, where σ here is the standard error, which is 1.25.

So the lower bound is 77, so the Z for 77 is (77 -77)/1.25 = 0. Similarly, the upper bound is 79.5, so Z is (79.5 -77)/1.25 = 2.5 /1.25 = 2.

Wait, 2.5 divided by 1.25 is 2. So the probability we're looking for is P(0 < Z < 2). 

I remember that the standard normal distribution tables give the cumulative probabilities from Z = -infinity up to a certain Z. So P(0 < Z < 2) can be found by subtracting the area up to Z=0 from the area up to Z=2.

Looking at the standard normal table, the area from Z=-infinity to Z=0 is 0.5. So P(0 < Z < 2) is P(Z < 2) - 0.5.

What's P(Z < 2)? A quick recall from the Z-table: the area up to Z=2 is 0.9772. So P(0 < Z <2) = 0.9772 - 0.5 = 0.4772.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Or should I use a calculator here?

Alternatively, using the Z-table, the value for Z=2 is 0.9772. So yes, subtracting 0.5 gives 0.4772. So the probability is 0.4772.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.4772. So the answer should be I.
</think>

The sample mean $\bar{X}$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu = 77$ and standard error $\sigma_{\bar{X}} = 1.25$. We calculate the Z-scores for the bounds:

- Lower bound $77$ corresponds to $Z = 0$.
- Upper bound $79.5$ corresponds to $Z = 2$.

The probability $P(77 < \bar{X} < 79.5)$ is $P(0 < Z < 2)$. Using the standard normal table, $P(Z < 2) = 0.9772$. Subtracting the lower bound (0.5), we get $0.9772 - 0.5 = 0.4772$.

The correct answer is **I: 0.4772**.
