Okay, so I have this question about the strongest base in liquid ammonia. Hmm, I remember that ammonia is a weak base, but when it's in liquid form, maybe its properties change. Let me think about the options given.

The question lists several compounds, and I need to determine which is the strongest base. The options are NH2−, NH3, NH+, N2H4, N2H5, NH4+, NH3+, NH4−, etc. Wait, I'm a bit confused because some of these might not be present or I'm mixing up the structures.

Wait, liquid ammonia is a liquid at room temperature, and it's a base. But wait, in liquid ammonia, the structure is different. I think liquid ammonia has a structure where the nitrogen is in a bent trigonal pyramid arrangement, with three H's and one NH2−. But when it's liquid, the NH2− can act as a base, acting as a weak base because it's a resonance structure and can accept a proton.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the structure of liquid ammonia. So, in liquid ammonia, the nitrogen has four bonds: three to H and one to NH2−. That's the structure. The NH2− is a resonance structure where the lone pair on N can delocalize into the adjacent H's, right? So the NH2− is a weak base because it's resonance-stabilized.

Wait, but the question is about the strongest base. So which of these options is a stronger base than the others. Let me think about the strength of bases. Strong bases are more willing to accept protons. So, the strongest base would be the one with the lowest tendency to donate a proton.

Wait, but in liquid ammonia, the base is NH2−. So in its solution, NH2− can accept a proton to become NH3. But in the options, the strongest base is the one that's a stronger base than the others. So, perhaps the strongest base in liquid ammonia is something else.

Wait, let's look at the options. Let me list the options again:

A: NH2−
B: NH3
C: NH+
D: N2H4
E: N2H5
F: NH4+
G: NH3+
H: NH4−
I: NH5+
J: NH2+

Wait, I'm a bit confused about some of these. Like, N2H4 is diethylamine, and N2H5 is triethylamine. NH4+ is ammonium, which is a weak acid, so its conjugate base would be NH3. NH5+ is a hypothetical, but I think it's not a common structure.

Wait, the question is about the strongest base in liquid ammonia. So the base in liquid ammonia is NH2−. But wait, the question lists NH2− as option A and J again. So, the options are all possible bases in ammonia, but the question is about the strongest.

Wait, but in liquid ammonia, the base is NH2−, which is a weak base. But when I think of the strength of bases, stronger bases are more likely to accept protons. So, if NH2− is acting as a base, in solution, it can accept a proton to become NH3. But what about other bases?

Wait, in liquid ammonia, besides NH2−, there's also NH3, which is a liquid as well. But NH3 is a weak base because it can't accept a proton easily. Wait, no, because in liquid ammonia, the NH2− is the base, but how does that compare to other bases?

Wait, perhaps the options are considering different compounds. For example, option J is NH2− again. So the options are all the possible base candidates.

Wait, let's think about the strength of bases. The stronger the base, the more willing to accept a proton. So, the strongest base is the one that can accept a proton more readily.

So, in liquid ammonia, the base is NH2−. When this accepts a proton, it becomes NH3. But in the options, I'm looking for the strongest base, which is a base stronger than the others. So, perhaps I should compare the options.

Wait, but the options include some that are not bases. For example, NH3 is a liquid, but it's not a base. So, option B is NH3. But NH3 is a weaker base than, say, NH2−. Because NH2− can accept a proton and become NH3, which is a weaker base than NH2−? Wait, no, wait: the strength of the base is determined by how easily it accepts a proton. So, if NH2− is the base, and it can accept a proton to become NH3, then the strength of NH2− as a base would be stronger than NH3, because NH3 is a weaker base than NH2−.

Wait, but wait. I think that in liquid ammonia, the base is NH2−, but when NH2− accepts a proton, it becomes NH3. So the strength of the base is in the NH2− form. So, is NH2− a stronger base than NH3? Or is NH3 a stronger base than NH2−?

Alternatively, perhaps the strength is determined by the stability of the conjugate acid. The stronger the base (B), the weaker its conjugate acid (A). So, if NH2− is a strong base, its conjugate acid (NH3) is a weak acid. Similarly, NH3 is a weaker base, so its conjugate acid (NH4+) is a weak acid.

Wait, but that doesn't directly compare NH2− and NH3 as bases. Wait, but when comparing two bases, the stronger one is the one that can accept a proton more easily. So, if NH2− can accept a proton to form a stronger acid than another base, it is a stronger base.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the strength among the bases. For example, NH2− is a base, and it can accept a proton to become NH3. But which one is a stronger base between NH2− and NH3?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the strengths in order. Strong bases are typically weaker acids. So, the stronger base has a lower tendency to donate a proton, but a weaker conjugate acid.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the pKa's. The base strength can be determined by the pKa of its conjugate acid. A weaker base has a stronger conjugate acid.

So, the strength of a base (B) is inversely related to the strength of its conjugate acid (A, where A = BH+).

If B is a stronger base, then A is a weaker acid.

So, let's list the options as bases and find their conjugate acids:

A: NH2− → conjugate acid NH3
B: NH3 → conjugate acid NH4+
C: NH+ → not a base, because NH+ is the conjugate acid of NH (which is a weak base)
Wait, wait: NH+ is not a base. Because a base should be a weaker acid. NH+ is actually a weak acid, but not a base. Because it can't accept a proton to form a stronger acid. So, NH+ is not a base. So, option C is not a base; it's an acid.

D: N2H4 → this is ethylamine. It's a base because it can accept a proton to become N2H5. So D is a base.
E: N2H5 → N,N-diethylamine. It can also accept a proton, so it's a base.
F: NH4+ → this is the conjugate acid of NH3. So F is an acid, not a base.
G: NH3+ → this is the conjugate acid of NH2−. So G is an acid, not a base.
H: NH4− → this is the conjugate base of NH4+. So H is a base.
I: NH5+ → not sure about this, but perhaps it's a base.
J: NH2− → same as option A.

So, the bases are options A, B, D, E, H, I, J. But the question is about the strongest base in liquid ammonia.

Wait, but the question is about the strongest base in liquid ammonia. So, perhaps the strongest base is the one with the strongest tendency to accept a proton. So, when NH2− accepts a proton to become NH3, that's a base. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the strength of NH2− as a base. NH2− is a resonance-stabilized base, but it's a weak base. But in liquid ammonia, it's the base because it can accept a proton.

Wait, maybe I should compare the strengths among the options. The strongest base is the one that can accept a proton to form the weakest acid. So, the base that forms the weakest acid when it accepts a proton.

The options are:

A: NH2− → forms NH3
B: NH3 → forms NH4+ (weak acid)
C: NH+ → not a base.
D: N2H4 → forms N2H5 (stronger acid than NH3)
E: N2H5 → forms N2H6 (even stronger acid)
F: NH4+ → acid
G: NH3+ → acid
H: NH4− → conjugate base of NH4+. So it's a base, but I'm not sure if it's stronger than the others.
I: NH5+ → not sure.
J: NH2− → same as A.

So, the acids formed are:

NH3, NH4+, NH5+, N2H5, N2H6, etc. Wait, but which of these is the weakest acid? The weakest acid among them would be NH3, because NH4+ is a stronger acid than NH3, but NH5+ might be stronger. Wait, but I'm not certain about the pKa values.

Alternatively, perhaps the strength of the base can be determined by the pKb, but I don't remember the exact values. Alternatively, I know that the weaker the base (higher pKb), the stronger the acid (lower pKa). So, the base with the smallest pKb is the strongest base.

Wait, let's think about the pKb's for some common bases. For example, ammonia (NH3) has a pKb around 4.75. Its conjugate acid, NH4+, has a pKa of about 9.24 (since pKb + pKa = 14 at 25 C). So, NH3 is a weaker base than NH2− because NH2− is a stronger base.

Wait, but wait, in liquid ammonia, the base is NH2−, which is a weaker base than NH3. Because when NH2− accepts a proton, it becomes NH3. So, the strength of NH2− as a base would be weaker than NH3's ability to accept a proton.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The strength of a base is the ease with which it accepts a proton. So, a stronger base would be easier to accept a proton.

If NH2− is the base in liquid ammonia, and it's the base that can accept a proton to become NH3, which is a weaker base than NH2−? Because NH3 is a weaker base than NH2−. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait, actually, NH2− is a stronger base than NH3. Because when NH2− accepts a proton, it becomes NH3, which is a weaker base. So, the base strength is in the order of NH2− being a stronger base than NH3.

So, the strongest base would be NH2−, as it's the base that's easier to accept a proton, making NH3 a weaker base.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think of some examples. For instance, NH3 is a weaker base than NH2−. Because NH2− is a stronger base. So, in solution, NH2− can accept a proton to become NH3, making NH2− a stronger base.

So, NH2− is a stronger base than NH3. Therefore, in liquid ammonia, NH2− is the strongest base.

But wait, the question is about the strongest base in liquid ammonia. So, the base in liquid ammonia is NH2−, which is the strongest base because it's the strongest base, and it can accept a proton to become NH3, which is a weaker base.

Wait, but wait another thing. Ammonia (NH3) is a weak base. In liquid ammonia, the base is NH2−, which is a stronger base. So, the strength of the base in liquid ammonia is higher than in other ammonia forms.

Wait, but the options include NH2− (A) and NH3 (B). Which is the stronger base? Because, for example, the base strength is determined by how easy it is to accept a proton. So, if NH2− is a stronger base than NH3, then option A is the stronger base.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting ideas. Let me think about the pKb values. For example, the pKb for NH2− is around 3.3 (I remember that). NH3's pKb is around 4.75. So, yes, NH2− is a stronger base than NH3.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So, NH2− has a lower pKb, so it's a stronger base.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the strongest base in liquid ammonia. So, NH2− is the strongest base in ammonia, but in liquid ammonia, it's the base.

Wait, but then the options are A: NH2−, and J: NH2− again. So, the strongest base in liquid ammonia is NH2−, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, in liquid ammonia, the base is NH2−, but is that the strongest base overall? Or is there a stronger base in the options?

Wait, the question is about the strongest base in liquid ammonia. So, the base in liquid ammonia is NH2−, which is the correct base. But is there any other base among the options that is stronger?

Looking again, option J is NH2− again, same as A and B.

So, between the options, the strongest base would be NH2−, which is among the options. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: NH2−.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me check the strength order again. The stronger the base, the more it can accept a proton. So, if NH2− is the base, and it's a stronger base than NH3, then NH2− is the strongest base in liquid ammonia.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the strongest base in a liquid ammonia solution, but I thought the base is NH2−, which is (as far as I know) the strongest base in liquid ammonia.

So, the answer should be option A: NH2−.

The question asks for the strongest base in liquid ammonia. Liquid ammonia contains the ammonia molecule (NH₃) in a bent trigonal pyramidal structure, where the nitrogen atom is bonded to three hydrogens and one NH₂⁻ ion. The NH₂⁻ ion acts as a weak base because it is resonance-stabilized, and it can accept a proton to form NH₃.

To determine the strongest base, we analyze the options provided:

1. **Option A: NH₂⁻**  
   NH₂⁻ is the base in liquid ammonia and is known to be a strong base due to its resonance stabilization. It is widely recognized as a strong base in liquid ammonia.

2. **Option B: NH₃**  
   NH₃ is a liquid but is not a base. It is a weak base because it is less likely to accept a proton easily.

3. **Option C: NH⁺**  
   NH⁺ is not a base but rather the conjugate acid of NH₂⁻. It is not relevant to the question.

4. **Option D: N₂H₄**  
   N₂H₄ is diethylamine and is a base, but it is not the strongest base among the options.

5. **Option E: N₂H₅**  
   N₂H₅ is triethylamine and is a base, but it is less strong than NH₂⁻.

6. **Option F: NH₄⁺**  
   NH₄⁺ is the conjugate acid of NH₃, not a base.

7. **Option G: NH₃⁺**  
   NH₃⁺ is the conjugate acid of NH₂⁻. It is not a base.

8. **Option H: NH₄⁻**  
   NH₄⁻ is the conjugate base of NH₄⁺. It is a strong base, but it is not the strongest base in liquid ammonia.

9. **Option I: NH₅⁺**  
   NH₅⁺ is not a base and is not relevant to the question.

10. **Option J: NH₂⁻**  
    NH₂⁻ is the same as option A and represents the base in liquid ammonia.

The strength of the base is determined by how easily it can accept a proton. NH₂⁻ is the strongest base in liquid ammonia due to its resonance stabilization. Among the options, NH₂⁻ appears to be the correct answer.
