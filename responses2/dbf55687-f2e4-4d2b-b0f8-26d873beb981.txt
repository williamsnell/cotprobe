Okay, so I've got this question about the binary number system. Hmm, binary... I remember it's the base-2 system, right? Let me think. Base-2 means each digit can only be 0 or 1, right? Because the base is the number of digits. So digits in base 2 would be 0 and 1. 

Wait, the question is asking how many digits a binary number has. Oh wait, no, it's a bit ambiguous. But I think the question is more about the number of possible digits rather than the number of digits in a number. Like, in binary, how many unique digits can you have. So the options are A:0, B:1, C:2, D:10.

Wait, the numbers here are digits. So binary digits are 0 and 1. So there are two possible digits. So the answer should be option C:2.

The binary number system uses digits 0 and 1. Therefore, there are two possible digits.

Answer: C:2
