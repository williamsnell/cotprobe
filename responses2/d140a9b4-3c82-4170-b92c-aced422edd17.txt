Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the change in Gibbs energy when the pressure on benzene increases. Hmm, I remember that the Gibbs free energy change is related to the molar volume and the volume change at constant temperature and pressure. Oh wait, I think it's something to do with the equation for Gibbs free energy change at constant T and P. 

Wait, the formula I recall is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. But since the temperature is constant (298.15 K), the second term SΔT is zero. So ΔG is just V multiplied by the change in pressure, right? Because ΔP is the change in pressure, from 1 atm to 100 atm, so the change is 99 atm.

Wait no, the change is from 1 atm to 100 atm. So ΔP is 100 -1 =99 atm. But wait, the volume here is the molar volume, I think. Because when you talk about the volume change, it's the change in molar volume.

Wait, wait, the question says it's 1.0 dm³ of benzene. So that's 1 liter, but in terms of moles, since the molar volume of benzene at 298 K is about 24.46 cm³/mol. Wait, 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³, so 1000 cm³ / 24.46 cm³/mol ≈ 40.93 mol. So, n=approx 41 moles.

Ah, right. So the molar volume is about 24.46 cm³/mol, which is 0.02446 m³/mol. Wait, but 1 dm³ is 1 liter, which is 0.001 m³. So 1 liter divided by 0.02446 m³/mol equals approximately 0.04093 mol. Oh wait wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, if 1 liter is 0.001 m³, and molar volume is 0.02446 m³/mol, then n = 0.001 / 0.02446 ≈ 0.0409 mol. Oh wait, no, benzene is a liquid at 298 K, so its molar volume is about 24.46 cm³/mol, which is 0.02446 m³/mol. But wait, 1 dm³ is 1 liter, which is 0.001 m³. So n = 0.001 / 0.02446 ≈ 0.0409 moles? That can't be right because 0.0409 moles would require 1000 cm³, which is 1 liter. Wait, that would mean that one mole is 25 liters. That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, benzene is a liquid, so its molar volume is around 24.46 cm³ per mole. So for 1 liter (which is 1000 cm³), the number of moles is 1000 / 24.46 ≈ 40.93 moles. Oh, okay, so n is approximately 41 moles. So, the volume change would be VΔP.

Wait, wait, but the change in pressure is ΔP = 99 atm. So, the molar volume change is V = n * V_m, where V_m is the molar volume. Oh wait, but wait, V_m is the same for the substance, right? Since the pressure change is applied at constant T. So, the change in V is ΔV = V_m * ΔP. But wait, ΔV is n*V_m * ΔP. Because V_m is the molar volume (1000 cm³/mol for benzene), so ΔV = 41 mol * 1000 cm³/mol * (99 atm) = 41 * 99 * 1000 cm³·atm. But wait, I'm not sure about the units. I need to convert this into kJ.

Wait, but I also need to get the equation right. The Gibbs free energy change equation is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But since the process is at constant pressure (since it's increasing pressure), but wait, no, wait, the question is about increasing pressure from 1 atm to 100 atm. So the process is at constant T and P. Wait, no, wait, no, the process is under constant pressure because we're increasing the pressure, so the process is at constant pressure. But wait, at constant pressure, for a process where pressure is constant but temperature is changing? No, wait, the question says the pressure is increased, but I'm not sure whether the temperature changes. Wait, the problem states that all gases are perfect and the data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated. So, wait, the process is at 298 K, but the pressure is changing from 1 atm to 100 atm. So, the process is at constant T (298 K) and variable P.

Wait, the formula for ΔG at constant T and P is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS, but wait, that's not correct. Because at constant T and P, the equation is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS, but the second term is zero because T is constant. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me clarify. The Gibbs equation is ΔG = VΔP − TΔS. But if T is constant, then the second term is zero. So ΔG is VΔP.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would give a positive ΔG if V is positive and ΔP is positive. Because benzene is a liquid, so its molar volume is positive. So if you increase the pressure, the volume would decrease, so the molar volume would decrease. Wait, no, the molar volume of a liquid doesn't change much with pressure. So, for benzene, the molar volume is approximately 24.46 cm³/mol, which is about 0.02446 m³/mol. So, when pressure increases, the molar volume decreases? Or does it stay the same?

Wait, no, wait, I'm a bit confused. For solids and liquids, the molar volume is roughly constant, but for gases, it does change with pressure (due to the ideal gas law). Benzene is a liquid, so its molar volume is about 24.46 cm³/mol, which is about 0.02446 m³/mol. So, when pressure increases, the molar volume actually decreases a little, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molar volume doesn't change much. So, in our case, the change in pressure is from 1 atm to 100 atm. So, the change in pressure is 99 atm. 

Wait, but wait, if the molar volume is constant, then VΔP would be the change in the volume for the substance, but when we have a gas, the volume change is significant. But benzene is a liquid, so perhaps the volume change is negligible. So, maybe the change in pressure is over a significant volume? But wait, the problem is about a change in pressure, but the volume of the substance itself isn't changing much. So, perhaps the main contribution to ΔG is from the volume change.

Wait, but in the case of a liquid, the volume change upon pressure change is minimal. So, the molar volume of benzene is approximately constant, so V is about 0.02446 m³/mol. Therefore, ΔV = n * V_m * ΔP. Wait, no, wait, ΔV = n * V_m * (ΔP). Because V_m is the molar volume. So, if the molar volume is V_m, then when pressure increases by ΔP (in atm), the volume increases by n * V_m * ΔP. But since benzene is a liquid, V_m is about 24.46 cm³/mol, which is 24.46e-6 m³/mol (since 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, 24.46 cm³ is 0.02446 liters, which is 0.02446e-3 m³).

So, the change in volume would be ΔV = n * V_m * ΔP. But wait, no, because when pressure increases, the volume of the liquid would decrease. Wait, no, wait, sorry, for a liquid, when you increase the pressure, it doesn't change much. So, the volume change is negligible. So, perhaps the change in volume is zero. That would imply that ΔG is zero. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is giving a non-zero answer.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. The problem states that all gases are perfect, but benzene is a liquid, so perhaps it's treated as a liquid. Hmm. Or perhaps, what if the process is at constant pressure and temperature, then the volume change is negligible, so the Gibbs free energy change is negligible, but that doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the volume change as the molar volume multiplied by the number of moles, and the change in pressure (ΔP) is from 1 atm to 100 atm, so 99 atm.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again about the formula.

The formula for Gibbs free energy change when pressure is constant is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But wait, wait, no. The correct formula is: ΔG = VΔP - TΔS, but if the process is at constant temperature and pressure, then VΔP is the change in volume (which is V multiplied by ΔP), and TΔS is the change in entropy multiplied by the temperature. But in this case, the process is at constant T and P, so TΔS would be zero because T is constant. So, ΔG would be VΔP.

Wait, but wait, benzene is a liquid, so its molar volume doesn't change much with pressure. So, the change in V (ΔV) would be V_m * ΔP, but for a liquid, this change is small. So, the molar volume is about 24.46 cm³/mol, so V_m is 24.46e-6 m³/mol.

So, the change in volume would be n * V_m * (100 -1) atm. Wait, but wait, the formula is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But in this case, since the pressure is increasing, ΔP is 99 atm. So, VΔP would be n * V_m * 99 atm. But wait, I need to make sure the units are correct.

Wait, the units here are tricky. Because V is in m³/mol, and ΔP is in atm. So, let's convert this into J/mol. Because J is the unit for Gibbs free energy. Because 1 kJ is 1000 J.

Wait, let's think about the units. V is in m³/mol, but for gases, the equation may be expressed in terms of liters and atm. Oh wait, I remember that for gases, using units in liters, atm, and kJ is more straightforward, because R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So, perhaps it's easier to use the formula ΔG = V_m * ΔP * n - TΔS.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the correct way to handle the units. Let me try to structure this step by step.

1. The number of moles, n = 41 (as calculated earlier).

2. The change in pressure, ΔP = 99 atm.

3. V_m (molar volume of benzene) is 24.46 cm³/mol. Let's convert that to m³: 24.46e-6 m³/mol.

4. So, the change in volume, ΔV = n * V_m * ΔP. But wait, no, because VΔP here is the product of the volume change (ΔV) and the pressure change (ΔP). Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The formula is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. Wait, no, perhaps another approach is better.

Wait, the correct formula for the change in Gibbs free energy when pressure is constant is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But if the process is at constant temperature and pressure, then ΔG would be zero (since TΔS would be zero? No, wait, no. Wait, T is constant, but ΔS is the change in entropy. But if the process is at constant pressure and temperature, the formula would be ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But if the process is isothermal and isobaric, then ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV) = ΔU + nRT (since PV is nRT at constant T). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost here.

Wait, alternative approach: for an ideal gas, the change in Gibbs free energy is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. For a liquid, perhaps the volume change is negligible, so ΔG is approximately VΔP.

But wait, benzene is a liquid, so I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the change in molar Gibbs free energy at constant pressure. Oh wait, no, the formula for ΔG at constant T is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But the problem is that we're dealing with a liquid, so the molar volume is constant. Therefore, the change in V is zero. So, ΔG would be -TΔS, but I don't have data about the entropy change. Hmm, but the question doesn't provide any data about entropy, so perhaps that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to use the formula for the change in molar Gibbs free energy at constant pressure, which is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But if benzene is a liquid, and since molar volume is approximately constant, VΔP would be negligible, leading to ΔG ≈ - TΔS. But again, without data on S, I'm not sure.

Wait, that's a dead end. Perhaps I should think about the general equation again. The equation for the change in Gibbs free energy when pressure changes is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But since the process is at constant temperature and pressure, the equation simplifies to ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But if V doesn't change, then ΔG ≈ - TΔS. But without knowing ΔS, I can't proceed. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the volume change for the gas, but benzene is a liquid. So, maybe I should treat it as a gas, even though it's a liquid. Let's think about that.

If benzene were a gas, then I could proceed with the formula. Let me calculate it that way. So, n is about 41 moles.

V_m is 24.46 cm³/mol, which is 24.46e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP is 99 atm.

So, VΔP = 41 mol * 24.46e-6 m³/mol * 99 atm.

Wait, but units: m³ and atm. Since R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but perhaps here I should convert the units to be compatible. Let me think about that.

Wait, 1 m³ = 10^6 liters. 1 liter = 1 dm³. So, 41 mol * 24.46e-6 m³/mol = 41 * 24.46e-6 m³. Then, converting m³ to dm³: since 1 m³ = 10^3 dm³, so 41*24.46e-6 m³ = 41 *24.46e-6 *10^3 dm³ = 41 *24.46e-3 dm³/mol.

Wait, no, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to calculate the product VΔP in units of J/mol.

Because 1 atm = 101325 Pa. And 1 m³ = 1000 liters. So, 1 m³ = 1000 * 10^3 cm³ = 1e6 cm³.

So, V_m (molar volume) is 24.46 cm³/mol.

So, VΔP = (24.46 cm³/mol) * (99 atm) = 24.46 *99 cm³·atm/mol.

But wait, to convert this to J, I need to convert cm³·atm to J.

1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³. 1 atm = 101325 Pa = 101325 N/m². So, 1 J = 1 N·m = 1 Pa·m³.

But 1 cm³·atm = (1e-6 m³) * (101325 Pa) = 1e-6 * 101325 = 1.01325 J.

Wait, that's correct. So, 1 cm³·atm = 1.01325 J.

So, VΔP in J is 24.46 cm³/mol * 99 atm = 24.46*99 cm³·atm. Multiply by 1.01325 J/(cm³·atm) to get J.

So, VΔP = (24.46 *99) * 1.01325 J/mol.

Let me compute that.

24.46 *99 = 24.46 * (100-1) = 2446 -24.46 = 2421.54.

Then multiply by 1.01325: 2421.54 * 1.01325 ≈ let's calculate it.

Approximately, 2421.54 *1.01 = 2421.54 + (2421.54 *0.01) = 2421.54 + 24.2154 ≈ 2445.7554.

But wait, 1.01325 is 1.01 +0.00325. So, 2421.54 *1.01325 ≈ 2421.54 + (2421.54 *0.00325).

Calculate 2421.54 *0.00325 = approximately 8. (since 2421 * 0.003 is 7.263, plus 2421 *0.00025 is about 0.60525, so total 7.263 +0.60525=7.86825). So, adding to 2445.7554 gives 2445.7554 +7.86825 ≈ 2453.62365 J/mol.

So, VΔP ≈ 2453.6 J/mol.

Now, the change in pressure is 99 atm. The temperature is 298.15 K.

So, the formula for Gibbs free energy change is ΔG = VΔP - TΔS.

But wait, since the process is at constant pressure and temperature, the change in entropy (ΔS) would be zero. Because entropy is a function of temperature and pressure. But wait, when pressure is kept constant, and temperature is kept constant, ΔS = 0. But without knowing ΔS, I'm stuck.

Wait, but the question is about the change in Gibbs free energy when the pressure is increased. So, the change in pressure is 99 atm. So, the change in G would be VΔP - TΔS. But if ΔS is zero, then ΔG = VΔP.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because that would imply that the change in Gibbs free energy is positive, which in the case of a liquid, would mean that the system becomes more favorable, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the change in Gibbs free energy for a process at constant T and P is given by ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But for a process at constant T and P, the change in G is zero, because ΔG = VΔP - TΔS, and if the process is at constant T and P, then the changes in T and P are zero, so ΔG = VΔP. But in this case, the process is not isothermal, but isothermal is the case here. Wait, no, wait, the process is isothermal (298 K) and isobaric (1 atm). So, the change in G would be VΔP - TΔS. But since the process is isothermal and isobaric, the change in entropy (ΔS) is zero. So, ΔG = VΔP. But then, VΔP is positive, so ΔG is positive. But wait, that would imply that the system becomes more favorable, which might not make sense because for a liquid, increasing pressure doesn't change the volume much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the change in Gibbs free energy using the formula:

ΔG = VΔP − TΔS.

But without knowing ΔS, this approach might not work. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔG = VΔP − TΔS.

But for a process at constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs free energy change is zero. Because, for such a process, the change in entropy is zero. So, ΔG = VΔP - 0 = VΔP.

Which would imply that the change in Gibbs free energy is positive. But that can't be correct for a liquid, because increasing pressure doesn't change the volume much, so the change in Gibbs free energy would be small. But wait, according to the formula, it would be positive.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this problem using the formula for the Gibbs free energy change for a gas, assuming benzene is a gas, despite it being a liquid. Because maybe I need to treat it as a gas.

So, V_m is 24.46 cm³/mol. So, V_m = 24.46e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP is 99 atm.

T is 298.15 K.

So, ΔG = V_m * ΔP - TΔS.

But for a gas, when pressure increases, the volume increases. So, the change in V is positive. So, VΔP is positive. So, ΔG = VΔP - TΔS.

But without knowing ΔS, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the approximation that the change in Gibbs free energy is VΔP. So, let's compute that.

VΔP is (24.46e-6 m³/mol) * 99 atm.

Wait, but I need to convert this into J. Because 1 J = 1 Pa·m³. So, to convert to J, I need to convert pressure and volume into the correct units.

1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So, 99 atm = 99 * 101325 Pa.

So, VΔP = (24.46e-6 m³/mol) * (99 * 101325 Pa).

Wait, but unit-wise, m³ * Pa = J. So, the product is (24.46e-6) * (99 * 101325) J/mol.

Compute that:

24.46e-6 is approximately 2.446e-5.

Multiply by 99: 2.446e-5 * 99 ≈ 2.4215e-3.

Multiply by 101325: 2.4215e-3 * 101325 ≈ 2453.6 J/mol.

So, VΔP ≈ 2453.6 J/mol.

So, if that's the case, then ΔG is approximately 2453.6 J/mol. But that's a positive value, and the options are all in the range of a few thousand J. Wait, but none of the options is exactly 2453.6 J/mol. The options are:

A: 9000 J

B: 4000 J

C: 2500 J

D: 1500 J

Wait, but according to my calculation, the value is about 2450 J/mol. None of the options match. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Compute V_m = 24.46 cm³/mol = 24.46e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP = 99 atm = 99 * 101325 Pa = 99 * 101325 = 99 * 101325.

Let me compute 99 * 101325:

101325 * 100 = 10,132,500.

101325 * 1 = 101,325.

So, 10,132,500 + 101,325 = 10,233,825 Pa.

So, VΔP = 24.46e-6 m³/mol * 10,233,825 Pa.

Compute that:

24.46e-6 * 10,233,825 = ?

First, 24.46e-6 is approximately 0.00002446.

Multiply by 10,233,825:

0.00002446 * 10,233,825 ≈ 248.3 (approximately).

Wait, but that's in J/mol, because m³·Pa is J.

Wait, but wait, 2446 cm³·atm/mol. Because 24.46 *10,233,825 = 248,348,375 cm³·atm/mol. And 1 cm³·atm = 1.01325 J. So, 248,348,375 *1.01325 ≈ 251,928,200 J/mol.

Wait, that's way higher than my earlier calculation.

Wait, I think I messed up the unit conversion. Let me try again.

V_m = 24.46 cm³/mol.

ΔP = 99 atm.

So, VΔP = 24.46 cm³/mol * 99 atm = 2421.54 cm³·atm/mol.

Now, to convert to J, we can use the conversion factor 1 cm³·atm = 1.01325 J.

So, VΔP in J = 2421.54 * 1.01325 ≈ 2453.6 J/mol.

Which matches my earlier calculation.

But the options don't include 2453.6 J. The closest option is C: +2500 J. So, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, but wait, the calculation in the problem says that benzene is a liquid, so perhaps the change in volume is not negligible, but the calculation still leads to a positive ΔG, which would imply that the system becomes more favorable. But when the pressure is increased, for a liquid, it's not expected to change much, so a positive ΔG might be an illusion, and the correct approach should be to consider the molar volume as a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ΔG using the formula for a gas, assuming benzene is a gas.

So, V_m = 24.46 cm³/mol.

ΔP = 99 atm.

T = 298.15 K.

Compute ΔG = V_m * ΔP - TΔS.

But without knowing ΔS, it's impossible. Hmm, but perhaps the problem assumes that the change in entropy is zero, which would make the formula ΔG = VΔP.

So, in that case, ΔG ≈ 2453.6 J/mol, which is a positive value. But the problem's options don't include that.

Wait, the options are:

A: +29,000 J

B: +24,000 J

C: +25,000 J

D: +15,000 J

Ah, option B is +24,000 J, which is close to my calculation of ~2450 J. So, the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because benzene is a liquid, and in the case of a liquid, the change in volume isn't that significant, so perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for a gas, assuming that benzene behaves like a gas. So, in that case, ΔG = V_m * ΔP - TΔS. But without knowing ΔS, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate it using the formula for a gas, treating benzene as a gas.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy at constant pressure, which would be ΔG = VΔP - TΔS. But if benzene is a gas, then perhaps the problem is intended to calculate VΔP, which is about 2450 J/mol, which is close to option B: +24,000 J.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of VΔP. Let me recompute that.

V_m = 24.46 cm³/mol.

ΔP = 99 atm.

So, VΔP = 24.46 cm³/mol * 99 atm = 2421.54 cm³·atm/mol.

Now, convert cm³·atm to J.

Using the conversion factor: 1 cm³·atm = 1.01325 J.

So, 2421.54 cm³·atm/mol * 1.01325 J/cm³·atm/mol = 2453.6 J/mol.

So, that's correct. So, ΔG ≈ +2453.6 J/mol, which is approximately +2400 J/mol. So, the closest option is B: +24,000 J.

Wait, but wait, the options are A, B, C, D, with B being +24,000 J. So, the correct answer would be B.

But wait, in the calculation, it's 2453.6 J, which is about 2400 J. So, the options are a bit off, but the intended answer is B: +24,000 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula for a gas, treating benzene as a gas, and the calculation comes out to approximately +24,500 J, which is closest to option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the molar volume. Let me check.

Molar volume of benzene is approximately 24.46 cm³/mol, correct.

So, the calculation seems correct.

So, the correct answer would be option B: +24,000 J.

To estimate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for benzene when the pressure increases from 1 atm to 100 atm, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta G = V \Delta P - T \Delta S
\]

where:
- \( V \) is the molar volume of benzene,
- \( \Delta P \) is the pressure change,
- \( T \) is the temperature,
- \( \Delta S \) is the entropy change.

### Step 1: Inputs and Assumptions
- \( V = 24.46 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol} \) (molar volume of benzene),
- \( \Delta P = 99 \, \text{atm} \) (pressure increase),
- \( T = 298.15 \, \text{K} \) (temperature of the process),
- \( \Delta S = 0 \, \text{J/K} \) (neglecting entropy change, as the process is at constant temperature),
- \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \),
- \( 1 \, \text{cm}^3 \cdot \text{atm} = 1.01325 \, \text{J} \).

### Step 2: Calculations
1. **Convert \( V \) to \( \text{m}^3/\text{mol} \):**
   \[
   V = 24.46 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol} = 24.46 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3/\text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Convert \( \Delta P \) to \( \text{Pa} \):**
   \[
   \Delta P = 99 \, \text{atm} \times 101325 \, \text{Pa/atm} = 99 \times 101325 \, \text{Pa}.
   \]
   Calculate:
   \[
   99 \times 101325 = 10,031,175 \, \text{Pa}.
   \]

3. **Calculate \( V \Delta P \) in \( \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{Pa} \):**
   \[
   V \Delta P = (24.46 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10,031,175 \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{Pa}.
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   V \Delta P = 2446 \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{Pa}.
   \]

4. **Convert \( V \Delta P \) to \( \text{J} \):**
   \[
   V \Delta P = 2446 \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{Pa} \times 1.01325 \, \text{J}/(\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{Pa}) = 2483 \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Calculate \( T \Delta S \):**
   \[
   T \Delta S = 298.15 \, \text{K} \times 0 = 0 \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Calculate \( \Delta G \):**
   \[
   \Delta G = V \Delta P - T \Delta S = 2483 \, \text{J} - 0 = 2483 \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The calculated \( \Delta G \) is approximately \( +2483 \, \text{J} \), which is closest to the option \( +24,000 \, \text{J} \) (option B).
