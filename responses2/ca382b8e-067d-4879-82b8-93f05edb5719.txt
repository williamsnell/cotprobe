Question:

Solve the following problems. (a) A plot of land containing 487 (1/2) acres were broken up into smaller plots containing 3 (1/4) acres apiece. Find the number of smaller plots that were formed. (b) 450 freshmen entered ahighschool. Of these only (2/3) will graduate four years later. Of those that graduate, (1/6) will receive an A average. Find how many graduating seniors will have an A average. (c) TheGoreman'sGlue Factory wishes to package 4,000 pints of glue in containerthat hold (2/3) pint each. How may containers are needed?

Options:

A: 145 plots, 45 graduating seniors with an A average, 6100 containers
B: 160 plots, 40 graduating seniors with an A average, 7000 containers
C: 135 plots, 65 graduating seniors with an A average, 5900 containers
D: 130 plots, 60 graduating seniors with an A average, 5000 containers
E: 125 plots, 75 graduating seniors with an A average, 5600 containers
F: 142 plots, 52 graduating seniors with an A average, 5800 containers
G: 155 plots, 42 graduating seniors with an A average, 6300 containers
H: 150 plots, 50 graduating seniors with an A average, 6000 containers
I: 140 plots, 55 graduating seniors with an A average, 6500 containers
J: 138 plots, 48 graduating seniors with an A average, 6200 containers

Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I need to find the right answer from the options given. Let me go through each part step by step.

Starting with part (a): There's a plot of land that's 487 and a half acres, which is 487.5 acres. Each smaller plot is 3 and a quarter acres, which is 3.25 acres. I need to find out how many of these smaller plots can be made. So, I think I need to divide the total area by the area of each smaller plot.

Let me write that down: 487.5 divided by 3.25. Hmm, let me calculate that. 

First, I can convert the decimals to fractions to make it easier. 487.5 is the same as 487 and a half, which is 975/2. Similarly, 3.25 is the same as 13/4. So, dividing 975/2 by 13/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/13.

So, (975/2) * (4/13) = (975 * 4) / (2 * 13). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

975 *4 is 3900. Denominator is 26. So, 3900 divided by 26. Let me see: 26 times 150 is 3900. So, 150. So, there are 150 smaller plots. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 150; let me check the options again. Option H says 150 plots. So that's correct for part (a).

Now part (b): There are 450 freshmen, and only 2/3 will graduate. So, I need to find 2/3 of 450. Let's calculate that. 450 divided by 3 is 150, multiplied by 2 is 300. So, 300 students will graduate. Of these, 1/6 will receive an A average. So, I need to find 1/6 of 300. 300 divided by 6 is 50. So, 50 students will have an A average. Looking at the options, option H says 50. So for part (b), H is correct.

Part (c): The Goneeman's Glue Factory wants to package 4,000 pints of glue. Each container holds 2/3 of a pint. I need to find out how many containers are needed. So, I divide 4,000 by (2/3). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 4,000 * (3/2) = 6,000. So, they need 6,000 containers. Looking at the options, option H says 6000 containers. So, that's correct.

Now, looking at the options, option H has 150 plots, 50 A average students, and 6000 containers. So that should be the correct answer.

The correct answer is option H, as it provides 150 plots, 50 A average students, and 6000 containers, which match the calculations for parts (a), (b), and (c).

Answer: H
