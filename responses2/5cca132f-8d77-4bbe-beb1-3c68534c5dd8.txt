Okay, so I've got this problem here about Shodi's points in a video game. Let me read through it again.

She earned 389 points in the first level, and then in the bonus round, she got an additional 116 points. The question is asking how many points she has in total after both the first level and the bonus round.

Hmm, so I think I need to add those two numbers together. Let's see, 389 plus 116. I'm a bit nervous about adding big numbers, but I'll take it step by step.

First, let me break down the numbers. 389 is the points from the first level, and 116 is the bonus. So, 389 + 116. I can add them digit by digit, making sure to carry over any numbers that exceed 9.

Let me write it out:

  389
+116
------
Starting from the right, the ones place: 9 + 6 is 15. So I write down 5 and carry over 1.

Next, the tens place: 8 + 1 is 9, plus the carried over 1 makes 10. So I write down 0 and carry over 1.

Now, the hundreds place: 3 + 1 is 4, plus the carried over 1 makes 5.

So putting it all together, I get 505. Let me check that, but wait, maybe I should do it another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, I can add 389 and 100 first, which is 489, and then add the remaining 16. So 489 + 16 is 505. Yep, that matches.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 515, option I is 525, H is 405, etc. So 505 isn't among the options I see. Wait, no, looking again, the options are A to J. Let me check them again.

Options:

A: 600
B: 300
C: 4,915
D: 1,005
E: 525
F: 495
G: 205
H: 405
I: 515
J: 505

Oh wait, option I is 515, which is what I got. So the correct answer should be I:515.

The correct answer is I: 515.
