Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a proton moving in a magnetic field. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a charged particle moves in a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. Oh right, that's the Lorentz force law, but I think the key here is that the force doesn't change the speed if the magnetic field is uniform and perpendicular. Wait, wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the force is perpendicular, it doesn't do work on the particle, so the kinetic energy stays the same. Oh right, that's the principle of conservation of energy in this case because the magnetic force doesn't do any work. So the speed should remain the same, but wait, is that always true?

Wait, wait, no, is it always true? Oh, wait, no, because in certain situations, like if the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the force is maximum. But in this problem, the proton is moving at an angle to the magnetic field. So the velocity has a component perpendicular to B, and the other component parallel. Oh, right, but the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, so it only changes the component of the velocity that's perpendicular. So the speed should remain the same because the kinetic energy is conserved. 

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about this. The magnetic force (F) is given by F = q(v × B), which is qvB sin(theta), where theta is the angle between v and B. But the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, so the work done by the force is zero. So the kinetic energy (which depends on the square of velocity) remains the same. So the speed should stay the same as the initial speed. 

Wait, so the initial speed is 1.5e6 m/s. So after any time, the speed shouldn't change, correct? Because the velocity's perpendicular component doesn't change, so the magnitude remains the same. So the speed after 4 seconds should still be 1.5e6 m/s. Looking at the options, option E is 1.5e6, but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the direction of the velocity changes, but the magnitude remains the same because the speed (which is the magnitude of velocity) doesn't change. So yeah, the speed should stay the same. So the correct answer should be option E, 1.5e6 m/s. But wait, am I confusing anything here?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, because the velocity is changing direction, but the speed is scalar. So after 4 seconds, the speed is still 1.5e6 m/s. So the correct answer is E. But wait, the options given don't have E as the correct one. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options:

A: 7.5 × 10^6

B: 1.0 × 10^6

C:4.5

D:2.5

E:1.5

F:8

G:6

H:2

I:5

J:3.

Wait, option E is 1.5e6, which matches the initial speed. So the answer should be E. But wait, why are the other options there then? Did I make a mistake? Hmm.

Wait, no, no. Because the magnetic field is constant, so the force is always perpendicular to the velocity. So the speed remains the same. So the correct answer is E. So the answer is E.

The problem involves a proton moving in a constant magnetic field. The proton's initial velocity makes an angle of 30° with the magnetic field. The key principle here is that the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity, meaning it does no work and does not change the proton's speed. As a result, the proton's speed remains constant throughout its motion in the magnetic field. 

The initial speed of the proton is given as \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \). Since the speed does not change, the proton's speed 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field remains \( 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \), which corresponds to option E.
