Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about X-linked recessive conditions and the frequency of affected males and females in a population. The problem states that the frequency of males affected is 0.10, and I need to find the expected frequency of affected females.

Hmm, I remember that X-linked recessive traits only show up in males, since females have two X chromosomes. So the males who have the condition must have one X that's affected and one normal X. But for females, they need two Xs, both of which must be affected. So if a female is affected, both of her X chromosomes must carry the recessive allele.

Wait, but the question is about the frequency of females affected, not the males. Oh, but wait, the males' frequency is given as .10, which is the proportion of males affected. So let's break it down.

Let me denote the recessive allele as 'a' and the dominant as 'A'. Since it's X-linked, males have only one X, so their affected status is determined by whether they have the 'a' allele on their X. So in the population, 10% of males are affected (so 0.10). 

In females, they need two copies of the recessive allele to be affected. So the probability that a female has both X chromosomes as 'a' (homozygous recessive) will determine her affected status. But wait, the question is about the expected frequency of affected females, not the percentage of males.

Wait, but the options suggest that it's possible that the females' affected frequency is influenced by the males' condition. Because the presence of males with the condition can affect the female's transmission of the recessive allele to their offspring.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the frequency of males affected is 0.10. So this is the proportion of males in the population who have the condition. So, given that, what would the frequency of females affected be?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Let's model this mathematically.

Let’s consider the population. Let’s denote the frequency of the recessive allele as 'q'. Since the condition is X-linked, females have two copies of the X chromosome, so the chance they have two recessive alleles (aa) is q². The males have one X, so the chance of having the recessive allele is q.

But wait, in this case, since the males' frequency is given as 0.10, that would be the proportion of males with the recessive allele. So, the frequency of males affected is q * (proportion of males) = 0.10.

Wait, no, wait. The frequency of males affected is the proportion of males who have at least one 'a' allele. Since males have only one X, they have the condition if they have the 'a' allele on that X.

So the proportion of males with the condition is q, because each X has a 50% chance of being 'a' (assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). Wait, no, wait. The frequency of males with the condition is q, but in the population, the frequency of males is 0.5 (assuming equal male-female ratio, which they are). So the total frequency of males with the condition would be 0.5 * q.

Wait, but the problem states that the frequency of males affected is 0.10. So 0.5 * q equals 0.10.

So 0.5 * q = 0.10 → q = 0.2.

Wait, that seems right. Because the expected frequency of males with the condition would be half the population (since it's X-linked). So if q is 0.2, that is the frequency of the recessive allele.

Now, the question is about the frequency of affected females. Since females need both X chromosomes to be 'a', the frequency of affected females would be q², because each X has a q chance of being 'a' (assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which is usually the case unless stated otherwise).

So q is 0.2, so q squared is 0.04.

Looking at the options, F is 0.02, and that's not 0.04. H is 0.0002, which is even smaller. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine. If the frequency of males with the condition is 0.10, then 0.5 * (q) = 0.10 → q = 0.2.

So, the frequency of females affected is q², which is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. So 0.04 is 4%, which is not an option here. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: 0.001
B:0.01
C:0.1
D:0.15
E:0.0011
F:0.02
G:0.0001
H:0.0002
I:0.05
J:0.2

Hmm, 0.04 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the impact of the condition. If the males have a higher frequency, that could influence the females' transmission.

Wait, the males' condition might affect the allele frequency in the population. But in this question, it's given that the males have a frequency of 0.10. So perhaps we don't need to worry about the impact from the males, because the question states that's the given data.

So, perhaps the initial approach is correct. So q = 0.2, females affected is 0.04.

But none of the options is 0.04. Hmm. Let me check the options again. Option F is 0.02, option B is 0.01. Are there any calculation errors?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the males have a frequency of 0.10, and males have one X, then the frequency of 'a' on the X is 0.10 (since all males with the condition have one 'a' and one 'A' X). So the frequency of the recessive allele 'a' in the population is 0.10.

Wait, no, wait. If the males have 0.10 affected, that means 50% of the population is male, and each male has a 0.5 chance of passing their X to the offspring. So the frequency of the 'a' allele in males is 0.10. So q is 0.10, because 50% of males have the X with 'a', so 0.10 = 0.5 * q. So q = 0.2.

Ah, okay, so that is correct. So the frequency of 'a' is q = 0.2.

So the frequency of affected females would be q squared, which is 0.04. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the effect of the condition on males. Suppose that having the condition doesn't change the allele frequency. So in the population, the frequency of 'a' is 0.2, as we computed.

But wait, the question is about the frequency of affected females. So, given that the population has a certain allele frequency, the females' affected frequency is q².

So, 0.2² = 0.04, which is 4%. But the options don't have 0.04. So perhaps I've misread the question. Let me re-read it.

The question says: "the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition is 0.10. What is the expected frequency of affected females?"

Wait, another thought: maybe the 0.10 is the proportion of males with the condition, but because females are affected only if both Xs are 'a', and males can only have one. So the number of females in the population is half of the males and half of the females. So the proportion of females in the population is, say, 'p'. Then, the total number of affected females would be p * (q²) * 2 (since each X has a q chance, but since females have two Xs, the chance is q squared. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the effect of the condition on the population, but that doesn't change the allele frequency. So, the q is 0.2, so affected females are q² = 0.04.

But the options don't have 0.04. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the given data is that males have 10% affected. So, the number of males with 'a' is 0.10 of the male population. Since males are 50% of the population, the proportion of 'a' alleles in the males is 0.10. So, (number of males * number of X per male) * (proportion of affected males) = number of 'a' alleles in males.

So, the number of males is 0.5 * N, where N is the population size. Each male has one X, so the 'a' alleles in males are 0.5*N * 0.10. But wait, no, the number of 'a' alleles in males is 0.5*N * 0.10. Because each male contributes their X to the males, and 0.10 of those Xs are 'a'.

But that's perhaps complicating things. Alternatively, let's think about the frequency of 'a' in males. The frequency of 'a's in males is 0.10, as given. Since each male has one X, the frequency of 'a' in males is the same as the frequency of 'a's in the population. Wait, no. Because males' X's are just a subset of the population.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as:

The frequency of 'a' in the population is q. For X-linked recessive, males have q, and females have q². Since males' frequency is given as 0.10, that is q = 0.10, because males are 50% of the population. Wait, but wait:

If the total population is N, then the number of males is 0.5N, and number of females is 0.5N.

The frequency of 'a's in males is 0.10, so the number of 'a's among males is 0.10 * 0.5N.

Since males have one X each, so the number of 'a's in males is equal to the number of males with 'a's, which is 0.5N * 0.10.

But each X in a male has a probability q of being 'a', so the expected number of 'a's in males is 0.5N * q. Because each X in a male has a chance q of being 'a', and there are 0.5N males.

Wait, that's another way to think about it. So, 0.5N * q = 0.5N * 0.10 → q = 0.10.

Wait, so that leads me back to q = 0.10, which is the frequency of 'a's in the population.

Hmm, but if q is 0.10, then the frequency of affected females would be q squared, which is 0.01.

Wait, but when I computed that earlier, I had q as 0.2. Now I'm getting q as 0.10. This is conflicting. Which is correct?

Let me approach it from another angle. Let's model the allele frequency in males and females.

Let me denote:

- p = frequency of the recessive allele (a) in the population.

- q = frequency of the dominant allele (A) in the population.

But wait, for X-linked, males get X from their mother and X from their father. So, in the population, the frequency of Xa in males is equal to the frequency of Xa in the population is q, because each male has one X chromosome. So, the frequency of males with Xa is q, but since it's X-linked, it's 0.5 * (frequency of Xa in the population). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's think that in the population, the proportion of males is 50%, and the proportion of females is 50%.

The frequency of males with Xa is equal to the frequency of Xa in the population multiplied by the proportion of males, but that's not correct. Because the proportion of males with Xa is q * (proportion of males in the population). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The frequency of Xa is the same as the allele frequency q. So, in the population, the proportion of Xa is q. But males are only 50% of the population, so the proportion of male Xa is 0.5 * q. Because each male has one X, and the chance of their X being Xa is q.

So, the frequency of males affected (males with Xa) is 0.5 * q. Since it's given that this is 0.10, we have 0.5 * q = 0.10 → q = 0.2.

So, the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.2. So, q is 0.2.

So, for females, the frequency of affected females is q squared. So 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.

But the options don't have 0.04, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the 10% is for females? No, the question says the frequency of males is 0.10.

Hmm, maybe I should think again about the model. Let me assume the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. So, for females, their genotype frequencies are computed as (q²) for AA, (2 q (1-q)) for Aa, and (1 - q²) for aa, but wait, no, for females, each has two X, so their genotype is based on the two Xs. So the frequency of aa is q², and the frequency of Aa is 2 q (1-q), and AA is (1 - q²).

But since males are affected only if they have at least one 'a' X, the frequency of males affected is equal to the frequency of Xa in males, which is 0.5 * q, because each male has one X, and the chance of Xa is q. So, 0.5 q = 0.10 → q = 0.2.

So, q is 0.2. So, the frequency of females affected is q squared, which is (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

But the options don't have 0.04. So perhaps I'm missing a step. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the effect of the condition on the allele frequency in the population, but I don't think that would change the allele frequency.

Wait, another angle: maybe the answer expects us to consider the fact that in the population, the proportion of affected males is 0.10, so the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.2, so the frequency of females affected is 0.04, but perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be 0.01, which is option B.

Wait, 0.04 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the frequency of males is 0.10, which is the proportion of males who have the condition. So, q is 0.2, as before.

But then the frequency of affected females is q squared. So 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.

But the options don't have 0.04. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but looking back, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

The options are:

A: 0.001

B:0.01

C:0.1

D:0.15

E:0.0011

F:0.02

G:0.0001

H:0.0002

I:0.05

J:0.2

No 0.04. So perhaps the correct approach must have me making a mistake in the initial reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the condition is X-linked, and the males' affected frequency is 0.10, which is the proportion of males with Xa. Since each male has one X, the frequency of Xa is 0.10. Because, in the population, males make up 50% of the population.

So, the total Xa in the population is 0.5 * 0.10 * N = 0.05 N.

But each Xa in a male contributes to the allele frequency. So, the frequency of Xa in the entire population is (number of Xa) / (total Xs). Since each male has one X, and each female has two Xs.

So, total Xs in the population = 0.5 N (males) * 1 X + 0.5 N (females) * 2 X = 0.5 N + N = 1.5 N.

Number of Xa in the population is 0.05 N (from the males) + (0.5 N * q) (from females, since each female has two Xs, and q is the frequency of Xa in the population). Wait, but wait. If in the population, the frequency of Xa is q, then the total Xa in the population is 0.5 N * q.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think again: the frequency of Xa in the population is 0.5 * (frequency of Xa in males) + (frequency of Xa in females) * 0.5 since females have two Xs.

But the frequency of Xa in males is 0.10, and the frequency in females is q.

So, the total Xa in the population is 0.5 * 0.10 * N (males) + 0.5 * q * N (females).

The total Xs is 0.5 N (males) *1 + 0.5 N (females) *2 = 0.5 N + N = 1.5 N.

The frequency of Xa in the population is (0.5 *0.10 * N + 0.5 * q * N) / (1.5 N) = [ (0.05 N) + 0.5 q N ) ] / (1.5 N ) = (0.05 + 0.5 q) / 1.5.

But this frequency should be equal to the frequency of Xa in the population, which, for the entire population, the proportion of Xa is 0.5 * (frequency of Xa in the population) in the males, plus 0.5 * (frequency of Xa in the population) in the females.

Wait, I'm getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach. Since the males' affected frequency is 0.10, and the males are 50% of the population, this implies that the frequency of Xa in the entire population is 0.10 * 2 = 0.2? No, wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, no. The frequency of Xa in the population is the sum of Xa in males and Xa in females, divided by the total Xs.

Wait, perhaps the total number of Xa in the population is 0.5 * number of males * 0.10 (since each male contributes their Xa) plus 0.5 * number of females * q (since each female contributes two Xs, each with a q chance of Xa).

But since the population is N, number of males is 0.5 N, number of females is 0.5 N.

So, number of Xa in males is 0.5 N * 0.10.

Number of Xa in females is 0.5 N * q.

Total Xa in population is 0.5 N × 0.10 + 0.5 N × q.

Total Xs in population is 0.5 N ×1 (males) + 0.5 N ×2 (females) = 0.5 N + N = 1.5 N.

So, the frequency of Xa in the population is (0.05 N + 0.5 N q) / (1.5 N) → (0.05 + 0.5 q) / 1.5.

But according to the problem, the frequency of males with Xa is 0.10. But that's just a part of the population. Alternatively, perhaps the frequency of Xa in the population is 0.10, but that's not stated. The problem states that in the population, the frequency of affected males is 0.10.

So, the frequency of Xa in the population is 0.10. So, (0.05 + 0.5 q) / 1.5 = 0.10.

Multiply both sides by 1.5: 0.05 + 0.5 q = 0.15.

Subtract 0.05: 0.5 q = 0.10 → q = 0.2.

So, this brings us back to the initial calculation. Therefore, q is 0.2, and the frequency of affected females is q squared, which is 0.04.

But this isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again.

The frequency of males with Xa is 0.10, which is 0.5 * q, so q is 0.2.

So, the frequency of females affected is q squared = 0.04. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the effect of the condition on the allele frequency in the population, which would not change the allele frequency. So, q remains 0.2, leading to 0.04 for females, but no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again.

If the frequency of males with Xa is 0.10, and males are 50% of the population, then the frequency of Xa in the population is 0.10 * 2 = 0.2. Because each Xa in the population is in a male (50% of Xs) and each Xa in a male is a Xa in the population.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The number of Xa in the population would be the number of males with Xa multiplied by the number of X per male. Since each male has one X, the number of Xa in the population is 0.5 * N (males) * 0.10 Xa per male.

But the total Xs in the population is 0.5 N *1 (males) + 0.5 N * 2 (females) = 0.5 N + N = 1.5 N.

So, the frequency of Xa in the population is (0.5 N * 0.10) / (1.5 N) ) → (0.05 N) / 1.5 N = 0.05 / 1.5 = 0.03333.

So, the frequency of Xa in the population is approximately 0.0333.

But the problem states that the frequency of males affected is 0.10, which is 50% of the population's males. So, perhaps the question is trying to trick me into thinking that the frequency of Xa in the population is 0.2, but it's actually 0.0333. So, perhaps the q is 0.0333, but that would be incorrect because X-linked recessive conditions are only present when q is present.

Hmm, but this isn't helping me get to the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the proportion of female carriers. Let me consider that the frequency of males with Xa is 0.10, so the proportion of Xa in the population is 0.10. Because males are 50% of the population, the frequency of Xa in the population is 0.10 * 2 = 0.2. So, that's the same as before.

So, I think the correct answer is 0.04, but it's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the frequency of Xa in the population is 0.10, so the frequency of females affected is (0.10)² = 0.01.

So, answer B.

Because, if 0.10 is the frequency of Xa in the population, then the frequency of females affected would be (0.10)^2 = 0.01. So, option B.

Wait, why is that the case? Because in X-linked recessive, the condition is XA XA, XA Xa, and Xa XA? No, wait, no. For X-linked recessive, you need at least one Xa. So, the condition is Xa Xa, Xa XA, and XA Xa. Wait, no. For recessive, it's Xa Xa, but XA Xa is dominant.

Wait, no, wait. For a recessive condition, the genotype is Xa Xa. So, any individual with at least one Xa will have the condition. Therefore, the condition is Xa Xa, Xa XA, XA Xa.

Wait, that's incorrect. No, for a recessive condition, the condition is Xa Xa. So, any individual with at least one Xa will have the condition. So, the condition is any individual who has at least one Xa.

So, the proportion of affected individuals is 1 - q, where q is the frequency of Xa in the population.

Wait, but in this problem, the condition is X-linked recessive, so only those with at least one Xa have the condition. So, the frequency of affected males is q (since each male has one X, and the chance of Xa is q), but since it's males, the frequency of affected males is q.

But the problem states that the frequency of males with the condition is 0.10. So, q = 0.10.

Wait, then for females, the frequency of affected females is q^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01, which is option B.

Ah! So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the frequency of males with Xa is 0.10, so q = 0.10. Then, the frequency of females with Xa Xa is q^2 = 0.01. So, the answer is option B.

So, the correct answer is B.
</think>

The question involves understanding the frequency of affected males and females in a population, considering X-linked recessive conditions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Understanding X-linked Recessive Conditions**:  
   - Males have one X chromosome, and females have two X chromosomes.  
   - A recessive condition requires at least one X chromosome with the recessive allele (a).  
   - Males with Xa are affected, and females with at least one Xa are affected.

2. **Given Data**:  
   - The frequency of males with the condition (affected males) is 0.10.  
   - This implies that the frequency of the recessive allele (q) in the population is 0.10, since males are 50% of the population.

3. **Frequency of Affected Females**:  
   - For females, the probability of having at least one Xa allele (and thus being affected) is the square of the recessive allele frequency (q²).  
   - Since q = 0.10, the frequency of affected females is (0.10)² = 0.01.

4. **Final Answer**:  
   - The expected frequency of affected females is 0.01, which corresponds to option B.

ANSWER: B
