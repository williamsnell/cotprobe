Okay, so I have this question about inductance and capacitance in an LC circuit. Hmm, I remember that resonance in an LC circuit happens when the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance. The formula I think is L times C equals something. Oh wait, right, the formula is L × C = (1/(4π²f²)), where f is the frequency. 

Wait, let me think. The formula I think I should use is L = 1/(4π²f²C). Yeah, that sounds right because the reactance X is 2πfL for inductance and 1/(2πfC) for capacitance. Setting them equal gives 2πfL = 1/(2πfC), which simplifies to L = 1/(4π²f²C).

So the given values are f = 10 MHz. Oh wait, MHz is million hertz, so 10 MHz is 10,000,000 Hz. Oh right, and the capacitance is 100 pF. Wait, pico is 1e-12, so 100 pF is 100e-12 farads. 

Let me plug the numbers in. L equals 1 divided by (4π² times f squared times C). Let's compute the denominator step by step. First, calculate f squared. 1e7 squared is 1e14. Then, 4π² is about 4 * (9.8696) which is approximately 39.478. So 4π²f² is 39.478 * (1e14) = 3.9478e15. Now, multiply that by C, which is 1e-10 (since 100e-12 is 1e-10). So 3.9478e15 * 1e-10 equals 3.9478e5.

Wait, 3.9478e5 is 394,780. So L is 1 / 394780. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 394780 is approximately 2.53e-6 Henrys. Because 1e6 is 1e-6 (microhenrys). So 2.53e-6 is 2.53 microhenrys.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.53 μH. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the required inductance for resonance at 10 MHz with a capacitance of 100 pF, we use the formula for resonance in an LC circuit:

\[
L = \frac{1}{4\pi^2 f^2 C}
\]

where:
- \( f = 10 \, \text{MHz} = 10,000,000 \, \text{Hz} \),
- \( C = 100 \, \text{pF} = 100 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F} \).

First, calculate \( f^2 \):
\[
f^2 = (10,000,000)^2 = 10^{14} \, \text{Hz}^2.
\]

Next, calculate \( 4\pi^2 f^2 \):
\[
4\pi^2 f^2 \approx 4 \times (9.8696) \times 10^{14} = 39.478 \times 10^{14} = 3.9478 \times 10^{15}.
\]

Now, calculate the denominator:
\[
4\pi^2 f^2 C = 3.9478 \times 10^{15} \times 100 \times 10^{-12} = 3.9478 \times 10^{5}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{3.9478 \times 10^{5}} \approx 2.53 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H} = 2.53 \, \mu\text{H}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is **J: 2.53 μH**.
