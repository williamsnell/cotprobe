Question:

A defendant and his friend were down on their luck. They decided they would make some extra cash by robbing the local liquor store. The friend didn't like guns and decided to use a toy gun, which looked like a real gun, but only shot water. The defendant was aware that the gun was not real. Their plan fixed, they walked into the liquor store late one afternoon when few customers were in the store. The friend produced the toy pistol and pointed it at the customers and the clerk. The defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the clerk began to rummage behind the counter for the key to the register. While his head was ducked, the clerk pulled a shotgun from behind the counter and fired it at the defendant and his friend. The defendant dived to the side, but his friend was shot and killed. If the defendant is subsequently charged with his friend's death he should be found

Options:

A: guilty of felony murder.
B: not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend.
C: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill his friend.
D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.
E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
F: guilty of second degree murder.
G: guilty of voluntary manslaughter.
H: guilty of first degree murder.
I: guilty, because the defendant was involved in the commission of a felony when his friend was killed.
J: not guilty, because the defendant did not pull the trigger.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically about felony murder. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a defendant and his friend decide to rob a liquor store. The friend doesn't like guns and uses a toy gun that shoots water. The defendant knows the gun isn't real, so he's trying to murder his friend. 

The details: The defendant and friend go in late, with few customers. The friend uses the toy gun aimed at customers and the clerk. The defendant orders everyone to the floor and the clerk searches for the key to the register. While ducking his head, the clerk finds a shotgun and fires at the defendant and friend. They both get shot and killed. 

Now, the question is, if the defendant is later charged with his friend's death, what's the charge? The options are various felony murder charges and others. 

First, I need to recall what the elements of felony murder are. From what I remember, felony murder requires the death of a co-felon, meaning that the death is attributed to the commission of a felony involving the co-accusement. 

In this case, the defendant is charged with his friend's death. So, the question is whether the defendant is guilty based on this. 

But wait, the defendant was aware the gun was fake. He ordered the customers and the clerk to go to the floor, and the clerk was going to search for the key. The friend produced the toy gun, pointing it at customers and the clerk. Then the defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the friend was shot. The defendant then dived over, but his friend was shot and killed. 

So, the key point is whether the defendant's actions are directly responsible for the co-accusement of the friend's death. The defendant ordered the customers to the floor, which might have included the friend. But the friend shot the defendant, which is a different situation. The defendant is trying to murder the friend, but is the defendant's act the one that caused the co-accusement?

Wait, no. The co-accusement is the co-conviction of the co-felon, which is the defendant's death. So, if the defendant's actions led to the co-conviction with the friend, then it's a felony murder.

But in this case, the defendant ordered the customers to the floor, and the friend was shot. Then the defendant and friend are both shot. So, the defendant's actions (ordering the customers) may have inadvertently led to the friend being shot. But that's more of a negligence issue. 

The question is whether the defendant's actions are directly responsible. The fact that the defendant ordered the customers to the floor and then the friend was shot by the gun would not necessarily mean the defendant's actions are directly responsible. It could have been negligence, like the friend being in the way. 

But the main point is whether the defendant's actions caused the co-conviction. The defendant ordered the customers to the floor, which might have included the friend. The friend then pointed the gun at the customers and the clerk. Then the defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the friend was shot. The defendant then dived and his friend was shot, and then the friend died. 

So, the co-accusement is the defendant's death. The elements of felony murder require that the co-accUSED was the defendant, and that he was directly responsible for the co-conviction.

In this case, the defendant's actions (ordering the customers to the floor) might not directly cause the co-conviction. The co-conviction is the friend's death, which happened after the defendant ordered the customers and the friend was shot. So, the defendant's actions may not be directly responsible for the co-conviction.

But wait, the defendant knew the gun was fake. That might have contributed to the co-conviction if the defendant was also using a fake gun. So, maybe the defendant's awareness of the gun's nature led to the co-conviction.

Wait, but the friend shot the defendant. So, the defendant was killed when he and the friend were shot. The defendant was charged with his friend's death, but the co-accusement is the defendant's own death. So, the co-accused is the defendant, and the co-conviction is the killing of the friend.

So, the question is whether the defendant's actions were directly responsible for the co-conviction, i.e., the killing of the friend. If the defendant was aware that the gun was fake and thus intending to kill, that might be a factor. But in the scenario, the defendant is trying to murder the friend, but the defendant's actions (ordering the customers to the floor) don't directly cause the killing of the friend. The friend was shot by the toy gun, which the defendant didn't intend to use. 

So, perhaps the defendant's actions (ordering) and the friend's intent (using the fake gun) are separate. The defendant knew the gun was fake, but that doesn't directly cause the killing of the friend unless he intended to use it. 

But if the defendant is charged with his friend's death, and the co-accused is the defendant, then the question is whether the defendant's actions were a direct cause of the co-conviction. Since the defendant ordered the customers to the floor, and then the friend was shot, but the defendant didn't kill the friend. So, the defendant's actions (ordering) may not directly cause the killing. 

So, the co-conviction isn't directly caused by the defendant's actions, which might make the co-accusement not directly justified. Therefore, the defendant isn't guilty of felony murder, which requires that the co-accused's death was directly caused by the defendant's actions. 

So, looking at the options, option A is guilty of felony murder. But since the defendant's actions didn't directly cause the co-conviction, A isn't correct. Option B says not guilty because the clerk was justified in killing. But the situation involves the defendant. Option C is not guilty because defendant didn't intend to kill. But if the defendant knew the gun was fake, that might contribute, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, the case is about whether the defendant is guilty of felony murder. So, the elements are that the death was co-accused with the co-conviction. If the defendant's actions didn't directly cause the co-conviction, then he's not guilty of felony murder.

So, looking at the options, the options don't all fit. Let me go through them again. 

Option A: guilty of felony murder. Well, felony murder requires that the co-accused's death was directly caused by the defendant's actions. The defendant didn't kill the co-accusement. So, probably not guilty of felony murder.

Option B: not guilty because the clerk was justified in killing. But the issue is that the defendant is the co-accusement, so the fact that the clerk killed would affect the co-conviction, not the co-accusement. So, the charge is about the co-accusement, not about the co-conviction.

Option C: not guilty because defendant didn't intend to kill. But the defendant knew the gun is fake, which might mean he intended to use it, but whether that's the case for felony murder. Alternatively, the intent may not be a defense.

Option D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon. That sounds like a possible reasoning. Because in felony murder, the co-accused is the co-felon, and the defendant is guilty of murder. The intent of the co-accused may not matter if the defendant is guilty of murder. So, perhaps the defendant is guilty because he committed murder, even if he didn't intend to kill him.

Option E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter is when a co-accused's death is attributed to another person's negligence, not recklessness. The defendant's actions may have been negligent, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option F: guilty of second degree murder. That would require more severe elements, like more severe physical damage.

Option G: guilty of voluntary manslaughter. That requires that the co-accusement's death was caused by the defendant's voluntary act, which doesn't seem to fit.

Option H: guilty of first degree murder. First degree murder requires a more severe physical damage and intent to kill. But the defendant didn't kill the co-accusement, only the co-conviction.

Option I: guilty because defendant was in commission of felony murder. That's the same as A. So, probably not.

Option J: not guilty because defendant didn't pull trigger. Doesn't fit.

So, considering all this, the correct answer is probably H: guilty of first degree murder. Because the defendant is guilty of felony murder, even if he didn't intend to kill his friend. Because in felony murder, the co-accused's death is directly caused by the defendant's actions. But in this case, the defendant's actions (ordering the customers, friend pointing the gun, etc.) didn't directly lead to the killing of the co-accusement. However, the fact that the defendant knew the gun was fake might contribute to the intent, but that's not a defense in felony murder.

Wait, but in the scenario, the defendant ordered everyone to the floor, which included the friend. The friend then shot the defendant and the clerk. Did the defendant commit the killing? No. The defendant was killed by the friend and the co-conviction. So, the co-accusement is the defendant's death. The defendant's actions didn't cause that. So, the co-accusement isn't directly caused by the defendant's actions, so he's not guilty of felony murder.

Wait, but the fact that the defendant knew the gun was fake might be a defense. If the defendant intended to use it, then maybe the co-accusement is justified. But I'm not sure if that's a common defense. For example, in some cases, the intent to use the wrong instrument can be a defense to felony murder. 

So, if the defendant intended to use the toy gun (knowing it was fake), then he might be guilty of felony murder. But the question doesn't state the defendant's intent. It says he knew the gun was not real. So, the defendant intended to use it, but whether that's sufficient for the defense depends on the law.

In the majority of cases, the intent to use the wrong instrument is not a defense to felony murder. So, perhaps the defendant is guilty of the murder.

Wait, but the fact that the defendant didn't kill the co-accusement, only the co-conviction, makes him not guilty of felony murder because the co-accused's death was not directly caused by the defendant's actions. So, the situation is that the defendant's actions (ordering the customers) and the friend's act (using the fake gun) led to the co-conviction, but the co-accusement is the defendant's death. So, the co-conviction is not directly caused by the defendant's actions, so he's not guilty of felony murder.

So, the correct answer would be A: guilty of felony murder. But wait, no. Because the co-accused's death was not directly caused by the defendant's actions. So, he's not guilty.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says he's guilty of felony murder. Hmm. Wait, looking back, the options are A through J. Let me check:

The options are:

A: guilty of felony murder.

B: not guilty because the clerk was justified.

C: not guilty because defendant didn't intend.

D: guilty because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.

E: guilty of involuntary.

F: second degree.

G: voluntary.

H: first degree.

I: defendant was in commission.

J: not pulled trigger.

So, the question is, is the defendant guilty of felony murder.

In this case, the co-accusement is his death. His actions did not directly cause the killing of the co-accusement. So, he's not guilty of felony murder. But wait, the options don't have an option that says not guilty. Wait, option A says guilty. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the defendant was the co-accusement and the co-conviction was the killing of the co-accusement, it's a felony murder. But the question is about the charge after the defendant is charged.

Wait, the question is: if the defendant is subsequently charged with his friend's death, should he be found guilty.

So, the scenario is that the defendant is charged with the co-accusement's death. If the defendant is guilty of felony murder, but the co-accusement is the defendant, then it's a felony murder. But the actual situation is that the defendant's actions (ordering the customers) didn't directly cause the killing. So, the co-accusement's death was caused by the co-conviction, not the defendant's actions.

Wait, no. The defendant's actions (ordering) might have indirectly led to the killing. But the co-accusement's death (defendant's death) is the one being charged. So, the co-accusement is the defendant, and the co-conviction is the killing of the co-accusement. So, the defendant is guilty of felony murder.

But the question is whether the defendant's actions (ordering) were directly responsible for the co-conviction. If the defendant was the one ordering the customers, and then the friend shot him, then his action was directly responsible. But the defendant was not the one who ordered the customers to the floor. The co-accusement's death (defendant's death) was because the friend shot him, not the defendant. So, the defendant's actions (maybe none) didn't directly cause the killing.

Wait, but the defendant was the co-accusement. So, the killing was of the defendant. How did that happen? The defendant ordered the customers to the floor and the friend shot him. Then the defendant and friend were both shot. So, the killing of the co-accusement was by the friend, not the defendant.

So, the defendant didn't kill the co-accusement. Instead, the co-accusement's death was the result of the friend's actions. So, the co-conviction was the killing of the co-accusement, not the defendant. Therefore, the co-accusement's death was not directly caused by the defendant's actions. So, the defendant is not guilty of felony murder because the co-accusement's death was not directly caused by the defendant's actions.

So, the correct answer is not guilty, which isn't one of the options. Wait, but the options don't have an option that says not guilty. Let me recheck the options.

Looking again, the options are:

A: guilty of felony murder.

B: not guilty, because the clerk pulled the trigger.

C: not guilty, defendant didn't intend.

D: guilty because felon may be convicted of murder of co-felon.

E: guilty involuntary.

F: second degree.

G: voluntary manslaughter.

H: first degree.

I: defendant was in commission.

J: not pulled.

Wait, none of the options say 'not guilty' as the answer. So, perhaps the answer is that the defendant is guilty. Wait, why?

Because the defendant knew the gun was fake, and so the intent to use a fake gun might be a defense. But in the majority of cases, the intent to use the wrong instrument is not a defense to felony murder. So, the defendant is guilty of felony murder.

But the question is, if the defendant is charged with the co-accusement's death, is he guilty?

Alternatively, maybe the fact that the defendant knew the gun was fake is a defense, making him guilty.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In felony murder, the key elements are that the co-accusement was killed by the defendant, and that the defendant's actions directly caused the co-conviction.

In this case, the co-accusement is the defendant's death. The defendant's actions (ordering customers, friend shooting) led to the co-conviction. But the co-conviction was the killing of the co-accusement, not the defendant. So, the defendant didn't kill the co-accusement. So, the co-accusement's death was not directly caused by the defendant's actions.

So, the co-accusement's death was caused by the friend. So, the defendant is not the one who killed the co-accusement, only the co-conviction. So, the co-accusement's death wasn't caused by the defendant's actions. Therefore, the defendant is not guilty of felony murder.

Wait, but according to the options, the answer is one of A to J. So, perhaps the correct answer is not guilty, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the fact that the defendant knew the gun was fake may be a defense, making him guilty.

Alternatively, perhaps the defendant is guilty because he intended to kill, even if he didn't kill him. So, D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.

That would make sense because the murder is for the co-accusement. So, even if the defendant didn't kill his friend, because he intended to kill them (knowingly), he's guilty of murder. 

But I'm not sure. So, the options' D says the defendant may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon, which is a defense.

So, the correct answer might be D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.

Alternatively, the answer is H: guilty of first degree murder.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The facts are:

- The defendant and co-felon (friend) went to the liquor store late.

- The friend used a toy gun (which is a fake one) that pointed at customers and the clerk. The defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and then the friend shot the defendant. The defendant and friend were then both shot.

- The defendant is then charged with his co-felon's death.

So, the co-accusement is the defendant's death, and the co-conviction is the killing of the co-accusant (friend). 

The question is about whether the defendant is guilty of felony murder.

In felony murder, the death of the co-felon is the focus. The defendant's actions (ordering the customers) may have led to the co-conviction, but whether the defendant is guilty of the murder of the co-felon.

The options suggest that the correct answer is H: guilty of first degree murder.

Alternatively, the fact that the defendant knew the gun was fake may be a defense, making him guilty.

But I'm not an expert, so I'll have to make a best guess.

So, I'll go with option D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.

The scenario involves a defendant and his friend who go to a liquor store late. The friend uses a toy gun, pointed at customers and the clerk, and the defendant orders everyone to the floor. The friend and defendant are both shot. The question is whether the defendant is guilty of felony murder.

**Key Elements of felony murder**:
1. The co-accusement (the defendant's death) must be directly caused by the defendant's actions.
2. The defendant's actions must be sufficient to cause the co-conviction (the killing of the co-accusant, which in this case is the defendant himself).

**Analysis**:
- The defendant ordered the customers to the floor and then the friend shot the defendant. The defendant and friend were both shot afterward. The co-accusement (defendant's death) was not directly caused by the defendant's actions. Instead, the co-conviction was the killing of the co-accusant (friend), who was killed by the friend and the co-conviction occurred indirectly through the defendant's actions.
- The fact that the defendant knew the toy gun was fake does not provide a defense to felony murder. felony murder requires that the co-accusement's death was directly caused by the defendant's actions, which was not the case here.

**Conclusion**:
The defendant is not guilty of felony murder because the co-accusement's death (defendant's death) was not directly caused by the defendant's actions. The correct answer is **D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon**.

ANSWER: D
