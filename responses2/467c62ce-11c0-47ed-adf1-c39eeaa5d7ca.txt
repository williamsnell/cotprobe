Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this geometry problem about a parallelogram. The question says that in parallelogram ABCD, angle B measures 110 degrees, and I need to find the measure of angle C. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about parallelograms.

First, I recall that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Also, opposite angles are equal. Another important property is that consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. So if one angle is 110 degrees, the angle next to it should be 70 degrees because 180 minus 110 is 70. But wait, let me make sure I'm remembering this correctly.

Let me visualize the parallelogram. So, ABCD has points A, B, C, D in order. So, sides AB are parallel to CD, and sides BC are parallel to DA. So angle B is at point B, angle C is at point C. Since opposite angles are equal, angle A should be equal to angle C, and angle B should be equal to angle D. So angle B is 110, which makes angle D also 110. Then angle A and angle C should each be 70 degrees because consecutive angles are supplementary.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me think again. If angle B is 110, then angle C, being the next angle, should be 70 because they are consecutive and their sum is 180. Yeah, that makes sense because in a parallelogram, for example, if you have a rectangle, which is a special case of a parallelogram, all angles are 90 degrees. So if one angle is 110, it's larger than a rectangle, so the consecutive angle would be smaller. So 180 minus 110 is 70. That should be angle C.

So the options are given as A to J. Let me look at the options again. The possible answers are:

A: 100
B: 80
C: 50
D: 60
E: 90
F: 145
G: 70
H: 110
I: 120
J: 130

From my reasoning, angle C is 70 degrees. Wait, but angle C is opposite to angle A, but I don't think that affects the measure. The key point here is that consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle B is 110, so angle C is 180 - 110 = 70. Therefore, the correct answer should be option G, which is 70 degrees.

The measure of angle C in parallelogram ABCD is determined by the property that consecutive angles are supplementary. Since angle B is 110째, angle C is 180째 - 110째 = 70째. 

Answer: G: 70
