Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about who declared Muhammad a prophet. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the exact answer, but I'll try to work through it. Let's think about the key points here.

First, I remember that Muhammad is known as the First Prophet of Islam. But I'm not certain who was the one who specifically declared him a prophet. I know that in the context of Islamic traditions, the naming of prophets is a significant topic. There are different terms used for them, like "Beast" or "Prophets," and there's a concept of the "Propheth of Muhammad," which I think is a term used for him.

Wait, I think the term for Muhammad as the prophet is "Uthman." So, Uthman was the Prophet. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the one who declared him a prophet. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone else like Umar, who is mentioned as the last Prophet before Muhammad. But I'm not certain about the declaration part.

Let me try to recall. The concept of the "Propheth of Muhammad" refers to Muhammad himself, and according to some traditions, he was the one who was declared the Prophet. So, perhaps Uthman is the one who said that he was the Prophet. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the order of the prophets.

Another angle: the term "Prophet" in the Quran refers to Muhammad. But in the context of the Hadiths, which are sayings or actions of Prophet Muhammad, there might be different terms. For example, "Uthman was the Prophet" or something like that. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, I think the correct answer is Uthman. Because in the Hadith, there's a reference that says "The Prophet Muhammad was declared the Prophet." So, Uthman was the one who was the Prophet. So the correct option would be G: Umar? Or no, wait, Uthman is mentioned as the last Prophet before Muhammad. So maybe the declaration is Uthman himself who is the Prophet.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up the naming of the prophets. For example, Ismail or Uthman are the main prophets. But I think the declaration is Uthman. So looking at the options, I think the answer is G: Uthman, which is option G.

Wait, let me cross-verify. I should remember that the term for Muhammad as the Prophet is "Propheth of Muhammad," and he was the one who was declared that. So the correct answer is Uthman. So the option G is Uthman, which would be the one who declared him a prophet. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone else. But I'm pretty confident that Uthman is the correct answer.

The correct answer is G: Uthman. Uthman was the Prophet who was declared the Prophet Muhammad according to the Quran and Hadiths. 

Answer: G
