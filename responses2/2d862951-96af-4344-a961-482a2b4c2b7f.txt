Okay, so I've got this question here about arranging numbers in order from least to greatest. Let me see how I can tackle this. The question provides a bunch of options, each listing four fractions and a decimal. My task is to figure out which option has them in the correct order from the smallest to the largest.

First, I need to understand what each of the options is saying. So, each option is a set of four numbers, and I need to determine which one is correctly ordered. The numbers given are:

0.75, 5/6, 1/8, and 1/3.

Wait, I think I should write them all down in decimal form to make it easier to compare. Let me convert each to a decimal.

Starting with 0.75. That's straightforward, it's 0.75.

Next, 5/6. Hmm, 5 divided by 6. Let me calculate that. 6 goes into 5 zero times. 6 into 50 is 8 (since 6*8=48), remainder 2. Bring down the next 0: 20. 6 into 20 is 3 (6*3=18), remainder 2. So 5/6 is approximately 0.8333...

Then, 1/8. That's 0.125 because 1 divided by 8 is 0.125.

Lastly, 1/3. That's about 0.333... because 1 divided by 3 equals approximately 0.3333.

So the numbers in decimal form are:
- 0.75
- 0.8333 (5/6)
- 0.125 (1/8)
- 0.3333 (1/3)

Wait, I should make sure I got those right. Let me confirm:

- 1/8: 0.125. Correct.
- 1/3: 0.3333. Correct.
- 5/6: 0.8333. Correct.
- 0.75: Exactly 0.75, so 0.75 is less than 0.8333 but more than 0.125 and 0.3333.

So the order from least to greatest should be the smallest number first. So we need to arrange 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, and 0.8333.

Now, looking at the options. Each option lists four numbers, so I need to find the one that arranges these in the correct order.

Let me list all the options again and see.

Option A: 0.75, 5/6, 1/8, 1/3
That's 0.75, ~0.8333, 0.125, 0.3333. So that's 0.75, then 5/6, then 1/8, then 1/3. Wait, but 1/8 is 0.125, which is the smallest. So that's not correct because 0.75 is after 0.125, which is not the least. So this option is wrong.

Option B: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6
So 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. That's correct because 0.125 is least, then 0.3333, then 0.75, then 0.8333. So this seems correct. But I should check all options to make sure.

Option C: 1/8, 0.75, 1/3, 5/6
So 0.125, 0.75, 0.3333, 0.8333. Wait, 1/3 is 0.3333, which is less than 0.75, so the order here would be 0.125, then 0.75, then 0.3333, then 0.8333. That's not correct because 0.3333 is bigger than 0.125 but smaller than 0.75. So the correct order should be 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. So option C is out.

Option D: 5/6, 1/3, 0.75, 1/8
That's ~0.8333, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.125. So that's 0.8333, then 0.3333, then 0.75, then 0.125. That's in the wrong order because 0.125 is the smallest. So D is not correct.

Option E: 0.75, 1/8, 1/3, 5/6
So 0.75, 0.125, 0.3333, 0.8333. That places 0.125 correctly, but 0.75 comes after 0.125, which is correct, then 0.3333, which is correct, but then 0.8333. Wait, no. The order here would be 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. So E is 0.75, then 1/8, then 1/3, then 5/6. Wait, 1/3 is 0.3333, which is less than 0.75. So the order in E is 0.75, then 0.125, then 0.3333, then 0.8333. So which is 0.75, 1/8, 1/3, 5/6. But 0.75 is larger than 1/3 (0.3333), so 1/3 comes before 0.75. So in the list, 1/3 comes before 0.75, so E is 0.75, 0.125, 0.3333, 0.8333. So the correct order should be 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. So E's order is incorrect because 0.75 comes first, but 0.3333 is next.

Option F: 5/6, 1/8, 1/3, 0.75
So ~0.8333, 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75. That's the reverse of the correct order. So F is definitely wrong.

Option G: 1/8, 0.75, 5/6, 1/3
So 0.125, 0.75, 0.8333, 0.3333. Wait, 0.8333 is 5/6, and 0.3333 is 1/3. So the order is 0.125, 0.75, 0.8333 (which is 5/6), and then 0.3333 (1/3). So 0.8333 is before 0.3333, which is correct because 0.8333 is bigger. So the order would be 1/8, 0.75, 5/6, 1/3. But wait, the correct order should be 1/8, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. So G is incorrect because after 0.75 comes 5/6 (0.8333) which is too big, then 1/3 (0.3333) which is smaller. So G is wrong.

Option H: 1/3, 0.75, 1/8, 5/6
So 0.3333, 0.75, 0.125, 0.8333. So the order is 1/3, 0.75, 1/8, 5/6. But 0.75 is after 0.3333, correct. But then 1/8 (0.125) comes before 0.75, which is correct. However, 5/6 (0.8333) comes after 0.75, which is correct. So the order is 1/3, 0.75, 1/8, 5/6. But wait, earlier I thought the correct order is 1/8, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. So H's order is not correct. Because in H, after 1/3, comes 0.75, then 1/8, and then 5/6. But 1/8 is smaller than 0.75, so in the correct order, after 1/3, it should be 0.3333 (1/3) then 0.75, then 0.8333 (5/6). So the correct order is G? No, no, G's order is 1/8, 0.75, 5/6, 1/3. That's not correct.

Option I: 1/3, 1/8, 0.75, 5/6
So 0.3333, 0.125, 0.75, 0.8333. So the order is 1/3, 1/8, 0.75, 5/6. But 1/8 is less than 0.75, correct, and 0.75 is less than 5/6 (0.8333). So the order is correct according to the numbers? Let me check. The numbers are 1/3 (≈0.333), 1/8 (0.125), 0.75, and 5/6 (≈0.833). So in order from least to greatest: 0.125 (1/8), 0.333 (1/3), 0.75, 0.833. So the correct order is 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6. So option I is 1/3, 1/8, 0.75, 5/6. So that's not correct because after 1/8 comes 0.75, which is correct, but before 1/3. So the correct order for option I is not correct because it's 1/3 first, which is higher than 1/8.

Option J: 5/6, 0.75, 1/3, 1/8
So ~0.8333, 0.75, 0.3333, 0.125. So in order, 0.8333, 0.75, 0.3333, 0.125. So the correct order should be 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. So J's order is 5/6, 0.75, 1/3, 1/8. That's 0.8333, 0.75, 0.3333, 0.125. So the order is 5/6, 0.75, 1/3, 1/8. That's incorrect because 0.125 comes after 0.3333. So J is wrong.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck each option.

Wait, the correct order is 1/8 (0.125), 1/3 (0.3333), 0.75 (0.75), 5/6 (0.8333). So the correct order is 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6.

Looking at the options again:

Option I is 1/3, 1/8, 0.75, 5/6. So this is 0.3333, 0.125, 0.75, 0.8333. That's incorrect because 0.125 (1/8) should come before 0.3333 (1/3). So I is wrong.

Wait, but looking back at the options, perhaps I missed something. Let me go through each option again.

Option A: 0.75, 5/6, 1/8, 1/3. So 0.75, 0.8333, 0.125, 0.3333. So the order is 0.75, then 5/6, then 1/8, then 1/3. That's incorrect because 1/8 is smaller than both 0.75 and 1/3.

Option B: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6. That's 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. That's correct. So option B seems correct.

Wait, let's go through each option.

Wait, looking again at option B: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6. The numbers are 0.125, 0.3333, 0.75, 0.8333. So yes, that's the correct order. So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought about option H, I thought it was incorrect. But according to this, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Let me make sure no other options also fit.

Wait, option B is 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6. That's correct. Are there any other options that fit the correct order?

Looking again:

Option I: 1/3, 1/8, 0.75, 5/6. So 0.3333, 0.125, 0.75, 0.8333. So that's incorrect because 0.125 comes after 0.3333.

Similarly, option H: 1/3, 0.75, 1/8, 5/6. So 0.3333, 0.75, 0.125, 0.8333. So 1/8 comes after 0.75, which is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B. So the answer should be option B.
</think>

To determine the correct order of the numbers from least to greatest, we first convert each fraction to its decimal equivalent:

- \(0.75\)
- \( \frac{5}{6} = 0.8333 \)
- \( \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \)
- \( \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333 \)

Arranging these decimals in ascending order gives: \(0.125\), \(0.3333\), \(0.75\), \(0.8333\).

Now, we compare each option to see which one matches this order.

- **Option A**: \(0.75\), \(0.8333\), \(0.125\), \(0.3333\) → Incorrect (0.125 comes after 0.75)
- **Option B**: \(0.125\), \(0.3333\), \(0.75\), \(0.8333\) → Correct
- **Option C**: \(0.125\), \(0.75\), \(0.3333\), \(0.8333\) → Incorrect (0.3333 comes after 0.75)
- **Option D**: \(0.8333\), \(0.3333\), \(0.75\), \(0.125\) → Incorrect (0.125 is the smallest)
- **Option E**: \(0.75\), \(0.125\), \(0.3333\), \(0.8333\) → Incorrect (0.125 comes after 0.75)
- **Option F**: \(0.8333\), \(0.125\), \(0.3333\), \(0.75\) → Incorrect (0.125 is the smallest)
- **Option G**: \(0.125\), \(0.75\), \(0.8333\), \(0.3333\) → Incorrect (0.3333 comes after 0.8333)
- **Option H**: \(0.3333\), \(0.75\), \(0.125\), \(0.8333\) → Incorrect (0.125 comes after 0.75)
- **Option I**: \(0.3333\), \(0.125\), \(0.75\), \(0.8333\) → Incorrect (0.125 comes after 0.3333)
- **Option J**: \(0.8333\), \(0.75\), \(0.125\), \(0.3333\) → Incorrect (0.125 is the smallest)

The correct order is found in **Option B**.

**ANSWER: B**
