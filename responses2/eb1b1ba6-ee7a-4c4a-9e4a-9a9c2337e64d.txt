Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a velocity equation: u = u_max * (1 - r/R)^(1/7). They're asking two things: part (a) is to find the ratio between the mean velocity and the maximum velocity, and part (b) is to find the radius at which the actual velocity equals the mean velocity.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I think I should start by understanding each part.

First, for part (a), the ratio of the mean velocity to the maximum velocity. I'm assuming mean velocity here refers to the average velocity over some path or region. But wait, the equation given is u = u_max * (1 - r/R)^(1/7). So, u is the velocity at radius r, and u_max is the maximum velocity, which I think occurs at r=0 because plugging r=0 gives u = u_max. So, the maximum velocity is at the center.

What's the mean velocity? Oh wait, maybe it's the average velocity over the radius from 0 to R. So we'd integrate u over the area (or volume, but in 1D maybe). Let me think again. Wait, the equation is a function of r, so perhaps it's a radial velocity profile. So, the mean velocity could be the average of u from r=0 to r=R.

Alternatively, there's another approach: sometimes mean velocity is defined as the volumetric flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area. But in this case, since the velocity is a function of r, which is radial distance, maybe it's the average velocity as a function of r. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this: The mean velocity (u_avg) would be the integral of the velocity over the area, divided by the area. Or if it's along a line, like for a one-dimensional flow, then the average could be the integral of u(r) dr divided by the length of the flow path. But in this case, the function is u(r) = u_max (1 - r/R)^(1/7), so it's probably a radial velocity profile, and perhaps we're looking for the average velocity in a circular cross-section.

So, to compute the average velocity, we'd integrate u(r) over the area and divide by the area. The area is πR².

Let me set up the integral. The area integral would involve integrating from r=0 to r=R, integrating u(r) times 2πr dr (since in polar coordinates, the area element is dA = 2πr dr). So,

u_avg = (1/(π R²)) * ∫ (from 0 to R) [u_max (1 - r/R)^{1/7}] * 2π r dr.

Simplify this expression. Let me factor out u_max and the constants:

u_avg = (2 u_max / R²) ∫ (from 0 to R) r (1 - r/R)^{1/7} dr.

Hmm, this integral might look a bit complicated, but maybe we can make a substitution. Let's let x = r/R. Then, when r=0, x=0; when r=R, x=1. Also, dr = R dx. Substituting, the integral becomes:

∫ (from 0 to 1) (R x) (1 - x)^{1/7} * R dx.

So the integral becomes R² ∫ x (1-x)^{1/7} dx from 0 to 1.

So substituting back into u_avg:

u_avg = (2 u_max / R²) * R² ∫ x (1-x)^{1/7} dx from 0 to 1.

The R² in numerator and denominator cancels. So,

u_avg = 2 u_max ∫ from 0 to 1 x (1-x)^{1/7} dx.

Now, I need to compute that integral. Let me think about the integral ∫ x (1-x)^n dx from 0 to 1. I remember that the beta function is related to this. The integral ∫ x^{k} (1-x)^m dx from 0 to 1 is Beta(k+1, m+1) = Γ(k+1)Γ(m+1)/Γ(k+m+2).

In this case, k=1 and m=1/7. So the integral becomes Beta(2, 8/7) = Γ(2)Γ(8/7)/Γ(2 + 8/7).

Γ(2) is 1! = 1. Γ(8/7) is some value, and Γ(2 + 8/7) = Γ(22/7).

So, Beta(2, 8/7) = Γ(2)Γ(8/7)/Γ(22/7) = [1 * Γ(8/7)] / Γ(22/7).

But I'm not sure if I need the exact value, because the problem is multiple-choice, and the options for part (a) are ratios, so perhaps I can find u_avg/u_max.

So,

u_avg = 2 u_max * [ Γ(2)Γ(8/7) / Γ(22/7) ) ]

But wait, Γ(22/7) is Γ(2 + 5/7) which is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the property of the beta function. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the integral numerically. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I can compute the value.

Alternatively, maybe we can use substitution. Let me let t = x, and then the integral becomes ∫ (from 0 to 1) x (1 - x)^{1/7} dx.

Another approach: integrating by parts. Let me set u = x, dv = (1 - x)^{1/7} dx.

Then du = dx, and v = ∫ (1-x)^{1/7} dx. Let me compute v.

Let me make a substitution: let z = 1 - x, so dz = -dx. So,

v = ∫ z^{1/7} (-dz) = - ∫ z^{1/7} dz = - [ (z^{8/7}) / (8/7) ) ] + C = - (7/8) z^{8/7} + C. 

Substituting back, v = -(7/8)(1 - x)^{8/7}.

So integration by parts: 

∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

So,

∫ x (1-x)^{1/7} dx = x * [ -7/8 (1-x)^{8/7} ] + (7/8) ∫ (1-x)^{8/7} dx.

Evaluated from 0 to 1.

Wait, let me think about the limits:

At x=1: (1-x)=0; at x=0: (1-x)=1.

So when x=1, the first term is 1 * [ -7/8 * 0 ] = 0.

At x=0: 0 * something is 0.

So the first term is 0.

So the integral becomes (7/8) ∫ (1-x)^{8/7} dx.

Which is (7/8) * [ - (1/(8/7 + 1) ) (1 - x)^{8/7 + 1} ) ] + C.

Wait, let me compute ∫ (1-x)^{8/7} dx. Let me set w = 1-x, so dw = -dx. Thus,

∫ w^{8/7} (-dw) = - ∫ w^{8/7} dw = - [ w^{15/7} / (15/7) ) ] + C = - (7/15) w^{15/7} + C.

So putting it all together:

The integral ∫ x (1-x)^{1/7} dx from 0 to 1 = (7/8) * [ - (7/15) (1 - x)^{15/7} ] evaluated from 0 to 1.

At x=1: (1 - x)=0 → 0.

At x=0: (1 - x)=1 → (15/7) → [ - (7/15) *1 ] → -7/15.

So,

[ - (7/15) (1-x)^{15/7} ] from 0 to 1 → [ 0 - ( -7/15 * 1 ) ] → 7/15.

But wait, let me compute the definite integral:

The entire expression is (7/8) * [ - (7/15) (1-x)^{15/7} ] evaluated from 0 to 1.

So,

(7/8) * [ ( - (7/15) [ (1-1)^{15/7} - (1-0)^{15/7} ] ) ]

Which is (7/8) * [ ( - (7/15) [ 0 - 1 ] ) ] → (7/8) * [ ( - (7/15) * (-1) ) ] = (7/8) * (7/(15)).

So, the integral is (7/8) * (7/15) ) = (49)/(120).

So, u_avg = 2 u_max * (49/120) ) = (98 u_max) / 120.

Simplify 98/120: divide numerator and denominator by 2 → 49/60.

So, u_avg = (49/60) u_max.

Thus, the ratio of mean to max is 49/60. Which would be option D or I. Looking at the options, option D is a) (49/60), and option I is (a) (48/60), which is 4/5, which is 0.8.

Wait, wait, wait. I thought u_avg is 49/60 u_max. So part (a) is 49/60, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might miss a step.

Wait, I set the integral from 0 to1 of x (1-x)^{1/7} dx to be 49/120. Then, the overall u_avg is 2 u_max * (49/120) → 98/120 u_max = 49/60. That's correct.

So part (a) is 49/60, which is option D. So the ratio is 49/60.

Now for part (b): find the radius r where the actual velocity equals the mean velocity. So u = u_max * (1 - r/R)^{1/7}.

We set this equal to u_avg, which is (49/60) u_max.

So,

(49/60) u_max = u_max (1 - r/R)^{1/7}.

Divide both sides by u_max:

49/60 = (1 - r/R)^{1/7}.

Take both sides to the 7th power:

(49/60)^7 = (1 - r/R).

So,

r/R = 1 - (49/60)^7.

Compute (49/60)^7.

Wait, 49 divided by 60 is approximately 0.8167.

Wait, let me compute 0.8167^7.

Compute step by step:

0.8167^2 ≈ 0.667.

0.8167^3 ≈ 0.667 * 0.8167 ≈ 0.544.

0.8167^4 ≈ 0.544 * 0.8167 ≈ 0.445.

0.8167^5 ≈ 0.445 * 0.8167 ≈ 0.363.

0.8167^6 ≈ 0.363 * 0.8167 ≈ 0.296.

0.8167^7 ≈ 0.296 * 0.8167 ≈ 0.2418.

So (49/60)^7 is approximately 0.2418.

So,

r/R = 1 - 0.2418 = 0.7582 R.

Wait, 0.7582 is approximately 0.758 R, which is about 0.758 R.

Looking at the options, option B is (a) 47/60, which is approximately 0.783, and (b) 0.758 R.

So the answer for part (b) is approximately 0.758 R, which is option B.

Wait, but looking at the answer options:

Option B: (a) 47/60, (b) 0.758R.

So, that's correct.

So, putting it together: part (a) is 49/60, part (b) is 0.758.

Looking back at the options: the correct options are (a) 49/60 and (b) 0.758R, which is option B.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the velocity profile given by \( u = u_{\text{max}} \left(1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)^{1/7} \). The questions are:

1. **(a) Ratio between the mean velocity and the maximum velocity**:  
   The mean velocity is calculated by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area and dividing by the area. Using the substitution \( x = \frac{r}{R} \), the integral simplifies and evaluates to \( \frac{49}{60} \). Thus, the ratio of mean velocity to maximum velocity is \( \frac{49}{60} \).

2. **(b) Radius at which the actual velocity equals the mean velocity**:  
   Setting \( u = u_{\text{avg}} \), we solve \( \frac{49}{60} u_{\text{max}} = u_{\text{max}} \left(1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)^{1/7} \). Dividing through by \( u_{\text{max}} \) gives \( \frac{49}{60} = \left(1 - \frac{r}{R}\right)^{1/7} \). Raising both sides to the 7th power and solving for \( r \), we find \( r/R \approx 0.758R \).

### Final Answer:
- (a) \( \frac{49}{60} \), (b) \( 0.758R \).  
- This corresponds to **Option B**.
