Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about GDP per capita growth in China from 1950 to 2016, after controlling for inflation and PPP adjustments. Hmm, I remember that GDP per capita is a measure of economic output per person. Inflation makes things more expensive, so adjusting for that can show the real growth. PPP stands for purchasing power parity, which adjusts exchange rates to account for inflation, making the GDP numbers comparable across different countries.

I'm a bit rusty on the exact historical data, but I think I remember some key points. I think China's economy was very different from other countries in terms of growth. For example, the U.S. economy had a 12-fold increase in GDP per capita from the 1950s to the 1980s. But China's growth was faster and more rapid.

Wait, but the question is about controlling for inflation and PPP. So that means we're looking at real GDP growth. I'm not sure if the PPP adjustments would have a big impact on the growth rate. I remember that PPP can sometimes make countries' growth appear different because of exchange rates. But for the overall trend, I think the real growth rates were similar to the nominal rates, especially in the 1960s and 1970s.

Looking at the options, they're all about the number of times GDP per capita increased. The options are from 20 fold (A) down to 4 fold (F) and up to 80 fold (H). I'm trying to think of the actual data. I think that in the early 1970s, China had a modest growth rate, maybe around 10-12%. Then, as the economy developed, it accelerated. Maybe around 20-30% per year or so.

Wait, the question is about the period from 1950 to 2016. That's a long time. I think China's GDP per capita grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1950 to 1980, the growth was around 10-12%. Then it stayed steady until the mid-1990s, and then started to accelerate again. By 2016, I think China had a real GDP per capita that's significantly higher than the U.S.'s target, which was 12-fold up to 1987 and then it's been growing more rapidly.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact numbers. I think the U.S. had about a 12-fold increase by 1987, but China's was way higher. For example, China's GDP per capita in 1980 was around 10,000 yuan (that's about $1,200 in 2016 terms). Then by 2016, I think it was over 100,000. So the increase is much larger. But the question is about controlling for inflation and PPP. So perhaps the real growth was higher because we remove the effects of inflation.

But the options don't have 100 fold. Wait, the options are: 20, 12, 25, 64, 8, 4, 50, 40, 16, 32. So 64 is option D, 32 is E, etc.

I think I remember that China's real GDP per capita grew by about 20-30% per year before 1990. Then, from 1990 to 2016, it's been more than double each decade. So let's say, from 1980 to 2016, that's about 37 years. If the growth rate was about 20% per year, that would be compounding, but it's more nuanced. Wait, but the growth rate might not be constant. Maybe it's higher in the mid-1990s.

Alternatively, considering the options, the highest is 64 (D), which is a doubling every few years. Let's think about the doubling time. The rule of 72 says that at 72% per year, doubling takes about 1 year. But China's growth rate is higher, so the doubling time is shorter. For example, 64 is 64 times, which is a doubling every 35 years. That would require a 20% net growth rate, which seems plausible if the growth rate was around 18-20% per year.

Wait, another approach: I think that by 2016, China's real GDP per capita was about 100 times higher than it was in 1950. Wait, 100 times would be 100-fold increase. But that's not an option. The options go up to 80 fold (H) and 40 (I) etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the U.S. had a 12-fold increase in real GDP per capita from 1950 to 1987. China's growth was faster, maybe 10-15 times higher.

But looking at the options, the highest is 64 (D) and 32 (E). So maybe the answer is D because China's real GDP per capita increased by 64 times, which is 2^6. That would mean a doubling every 3 years or so. Let me calculate: 64 is 2^6, so perhaps the growth rate was 6 times per decadal period, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 8 fold (E), but I'm not certain. Another approach is to think about historical data points. For instance, in 2000, I think China's GDP per capita was around $10,000, and by 2016, it's about $100,000. That's a 10-fold increase. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: 20

B:12

C:25

D:64

E:8

F:4

G:50

H:40

I:16

J:32

So the maximum is 64, which is 2^6. Maybe the growth rate was about 18-20% per year, leading to a 64-fold increase over time.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 8 fold (E) because I've heard of China achieving a 40% growth rate, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because 40-fold would be way too high.

Wait, another angle: the real GDP per capita growth rate in China. I think the average growth rate was around 10% per year from 1950 to 2016, which would lead to a growth of 2^(10*66) = 2^66, which is way too high. But I'm not sure; maybe the actual growth rate was higher, like 15-20% per year.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the options. The question is about about how much GDP per capita increased. Let's think of the options. For instance, 64 is a significant increase, maybe by 2016, which is 66 years. If the growth rate was 20% per year, the formula is (1.2)^66. Let me calculate log(1.2)^66: 66 * ln(1.2) ≈ 66 * 0.182 ≈ 12. So e^12 ≈ 1627. But that's way more than 64. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the growth rate was about 15% per year. Then (1.15)^66. Using log: 66 * ln(1.15) ≈ 66 * 0.1398 ≈ 9.23. e^9.23 is about 1000. So 1000 fold increase? That's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the growth rate was about 10% per year, so (1.1)^66. Let's compute log: ln(1.1)=0.0953, so 66 * 0.0953 ≈ 6.295. e^6.295 is about 500. So 500-fold increase. That would align with option G:50 fold.

But I'm not sure. Maybe China's growth was around 16% per year, so (1.16)^66. ln(1.16)=0.148, 66*0.148=9.768. e^9.768 ≈ 1870. So 1870-fold increase. That's not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what I remember about the data. I think that China's real GDP per capita grew significantly, reaching around $100,000 in 2016 compared to $2000 in 1950. That's a 100-fold increase. But again, this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the growth in real terms, and the options don't have 100, but 64 is the closest. Alternatively, considering that the real GDP per capita growth from 1950 to 2016 is about 64 times. I remember reading that China achieved a 64-fold increase in real GDP per capita, which would correspond to option D: by 64 fold.

Wait, another thought: maybe I'm confusing real and nominal growth. The question says " controlling for inflation and PPP-adjustment." So that would remove the inflation component, so the growth is real. So the answer is real growth.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 8-fold. Wait, but that would be a much smaller growth. Let me think about the actual data. If I look at the data from China's economic history, by 1980, the real GDP per capita was about 1500 yuan. By 2016, it's about 10,000 yuan. That's a 6.6-fold increase (1600 to 10000 would be about 6.6 times). But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 8 fold (E). Alternatively, maybe the growth was around 40 fold, which is option H. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of more concrete points. I remember that the real GDP per capita in China grew rapidly, and by 2016, it was over 100 times higher than in 1950. But the options don't have 100. The highest is 80-fold (H). So perhaps the correct option is D:64 fold.

Wait, another angle: I think that the overall trend was high growth, but the actual data might have been less than 64 fold. I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 8 fold (E), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the real GDP per capita for China from 1950 to 2016 increased by about 64 times. I've heard that it's around that number. So the correct answer would be D:64 fold.
</think>

The question asks about the approximate increase in China's GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, adjusted for inflation and PPP. After considering the options and historical data, the correct answer is D: by 64 fold. This corresponds to the significant growth in real GDP per capita, reflecting the rapid economic development of China during that period.
