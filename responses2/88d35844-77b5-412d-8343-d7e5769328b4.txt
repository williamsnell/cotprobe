Question:

The Lincoln Theater had been showing old films for two months. Admission was $2.00 and average daily attendance was 200. Then, the owner decided to present a recent blockbuster film. Admission price was raised to $4.00 to cover the cost of the new film and average daily attendance rose to 600. Does this example cast doubt upon the law of demand?

Options:

A: The demand curve is upward-sloping
B: The admission price increase caused the demand to rise
C: The law of demand predicts constant attendance regardless of price
D: The demand curve is perfectly inelastic
E: The law of demand is disproved
F: The law of demand is irrelevant in this scenario
G: The law of demand only applies to goods, not services
H: The change in attendance is due to factors other than price
I: The law of demand remains intact
J: The increase in attendance was a coincidence unrelated to the price change

Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about whether the example given in the Lincoln Theater scenario casts doubt upon the law of demand. The options are A to J, each with a different economic concept. I need to figure out which one applies here.

Alright, let's start by understanding what the law of demand says. From what I remember, the law of demand states that there's an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded. So, as price goes up, quantity demanded goes down, and vice versa. This is because, with all else being equal, higher prices make the good less desirable relative to other alternatives.

Now, the scenario: The Lincoln Theater had been showing old films for two months. The original price was $2.00, and the average attendance was 200 people per day. Then, the owner raised the price to $4.00 to cover the cost of the new, more expensive film. The average daily attendance jumped to 600, which is three times higher.

Hmm. So, in this case, the price increased (from $2 to $4), and the quantity demanded increased (from 200 to 600). That suggests that according to the law of demand, when price goes up, quantity demanded goes down. But here, the opposite happened. So, the law of demand would not hold if this actually occurred.

Wait, but why did this happen? Let me think. Maybe there are other factors at play that the law of demand doesn't account for. The law assumes that all other factors are constant. But in this scenario, the price went up, but the attendance increased. Could there be other reasons? Like maybe the new film was better, so people are more willing to pay the higher price. Or perhaps the price increase was justified by the new film's cost, so people are more willing to pay a higher price to get it.

Alternatively, maybe the demand curve is such that the quantity demanded increased when price increased. That would suggest that the demand is not just the standard inverse relationship. So, if the demand curve is upward sloping, that would mean that as price goes up, quantity goes up, which would contradict the law of demand. But wait, the options don't directly say that.

Options: Let's go through them.

Option A: The demand curve is upward-sloping. If that's the case, that would mean that as price increases, quantity demanded increases. That would be a scenario where the law of demand is being challenged. Because the law says that, under other factors held constant, higher prices mean lower quantity demanded. But if the demand curve is upward sloping, then the quantity could increase with higher prices, which would contradict the law of demand.

But wait, the question is about whether this example casts doubt upon the law of demand. So, if the demand curve is upward-sloping, it's showing that the quantity demanded increases when price increases, which would mean that the law of demand is being disproven. But I'm not sure yet.

Option B: The admission price increase caused the demand to rise. This is talking about the direct effect of the price change on demand. But the law of demand is about the relationship between price and quantity when all else is equal. So, this might not be the same as the law of demand. It's more about the price effect on demand, not the underlying law.

Option C: The law of demand predicts constant attendance regardless of price. But that's not directly related to the example. That option is about the law of demand not holding, but the example shows an increase in quantity when price increased. So this option doesn't seem relevant.

Option D: The demand curve is perfectly inelastic. That would mean quantity doesn't change with price. But here, attendance went up, so that's not the case.

Option E: The law of demand remains intact. No, because the example shows an increase in quantity when price increased, so the law of demand is being challenged.

Option F: The law of demand is irrelevant in this scenario. But that's not true because the example shows an effect, so the law must apply.

Option G: The law of demand only applies to goods, not services. Well, I think the law of demand applies to both goods and services, just that the demand curve for services is usually somewhat irrelevant because they're often considered infinitely divisible. But that's not directly relevant to this example.

Option H: The change in attendance is due to factors other than price. So, maybe the price increase was justified by the new film's cost, so people were more willing to pay higher prices. That could mean that the demand curve is upward sloping, but the change is due to other factors, not just price. So wait, this option is suggesting that the demand is changing because of other reasons, but the law of demand would have been violated if the price effect was the only factor.

Option I: The law of demand remains intact. But that's not the case. The example contradicts the law.

Option J: The increase in attendance was a coincidence unrelated to the price change. That's not supported by the scenario since attendance went up when the price went up.

So, the key is that in this scenario, the price increase led to an increase in attendance. This would suggest that the demand curve is upward sloping, which contradicts the law of demand. But wait, the law of demand is about the inverse relationship. So, if the demand curve is upward sloping, that would mean that higher prices lead to higher quantity demanded. That directly contradicts the law of demand, which would imply that either the law of demand is wrong, or an external factor is at play.

So, looking back at the question, the question is whether the example casts doubt upon the law of demand. If the real data shows that price increased and quantity increased, then the law of demand is being contradicted. But the question is about whether the example shows that the law is being disproved, or if it shows that the law is invalid.

Wait, the question is about whether the example casts doubt upon the law of demand. So, the example shows that when price increases, quantity demanded increases. That would directly contradict the law of demand, which says that with other things equal, higher prices lead to lower quantity demanded. So, this would show that the law is being challenged.

Alternatively, if the demand curve is upward sloping (option A), that would mean that the law of demand is wrong because the law says that when price increases, quantity demanded decreases. So, if the demand curve is upward sloping, the law is not holding. But the question is about whether the example (the scenario) casts doubt on the law of demand.

In this case, the example shows that demand increases when price increases, which directly violates the law of demand. So, the example supports the idea that the law is being disproved.

Wait, but the options are about whether the example (the scenario) is a counterexample to the law. So, if the example shows that, then the law is being challenged.

Alternatively, the law of demand is that quantity demanded decreases when price increases. So, in the example, when price goes up, quantity goes up, which means the law is being violated. So the example shows that the law is not holding.

But wait, the question is whether the example casts doubt. So, the answer would be that the example supports the idea that the law is being challenged, meaning the law is not holding. So, which option says that the law of demand is being disproved?

Looking at the options, E is "The law of demand remains intact." That's not correct because the example contradicts it.

Option A says the demand curve is upward-sloping, which would mean that higher prices lead to higher quantity demanded, which is a direct contradiction to the law of demand.

So, the example (the change in price and attendance) supports the idea that the demand curve is upward sloping, which would mean that the law of demand is being disproved.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The law of demand would say that as price increases, quantity demanded decreases. The example shows the opposite: higher price leads to higher quantity demanded. So, which option is that?

Looking at the options:

E: The law of demand remains intact. No, wait the example contradicts it.

Wait, the question is: Does this example cast doubt upon the law of demand? So, the example shows that the law of demand is being violated, which would mean that the law is not holding. So the correct option is the one that says the law is being challenged.

So, which option says that the demand curve is upward sloping, which is A.

Wait, no, option E says the law remains intact. So, the correct answer is that the example contradicts the law, so the law is being disproved. But looking at the options, E is "The law of demand remains intact" which would be incorrect. So, the correct answer would be E if the law is intact. But wait, no.

Wait, the question is about whether the example casts doubt upon the law. So, the example shows that when price increases, quantity demanded increases. This directly contradicts the law of demand. So the example shows that the law is being broken, so the law is not holding. So the answer would be that the example shows that the law is being disproved.

Looking at the options, which one is about the law of demand not holding because of the data.

Option E is "The law of demand remains intact." No, because the example shows the opposite.

Option A says the demand curve is upward-sloping. So, if that's the case, the law of demand is being challenged because it's showing that when price increases, quantity demanded increases, which would be an upward-sloping demand curve. So, the example (the change in price and attendance) would show that the demand curve is upward-sloping, which is a violation of the law of demand.

So, the example shows that the demand curve is upward-sloping, which would mean that the law of demand is not holding. So the answer is option A: The demand curve is upward-sloping.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the law of demand again. The law says that as price increases, the quantity demanded decreases. So, if in reality, when price increases, quantity demanded increases, that's a direct contradiction. So, the example supports the idea that the demand curve is upward-sloping, which would be a violation of the law of demand.

So, the example (the change) shows that the demand is not following the law of demand, so the law is being disproved.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is the one that says the law is being challenged. So, which option says that?

Option E says the law remains intact, which is incorrect. Option A says the demand curve is upward-sloping, which supports the law's violation.

Wait, but the question is about whether the example (the scenario) casts doubt. So, the scenario shows that the law is being broken. So, the correct answer is that the demand curve is upward-sloping (option A), which would imply that higher prices lead to higher quantity demanded. So, the example supports that the demand is not following the law of demand.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the options is the answer. So, the correct answer is the option that says the demand curve is upward-sloping. So, the correct option is A.
</think>

The question examines whether the example provided (the Lincoln Theater scenario) casts doubt upon the law of demand. The law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. In the scenario, the price of a film ticket increased from $2.00 to $4.00, leading to a significant increase in attendance from 200 to 600. This directly contradicts the law of demand, which would predict that a higher price would result in a lower quantity demanded.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A: The demand curve is upward-sloping**  
  An upward-sloping demand curve would indicate that as price increases, quantity demanded also increases. This directly contradicts the law of demand. The example shows that the demand curve is upward-sloping, which supports the idea that the law of demand is being challenged.

- **Option B: The admission price increase caused the demand to rise**  
  This option focuses on the direct effect of the price increase on demand. However, the law of demand is about the relationship between price and quantity demanded, not the cause of the change. This option is less relevant to the scenario.

- **Option C: The law of demand predicts constant attendance regardless of price**  
  This option is irrelevant to the example because the law of demand does not predict constant attendance. The example shows an increase in attendance with a price increase.

- **Option D: The demand curve is perfectly inelastic**  
  A perfectly inelastic demand curve would have constant quantity demanded regardless of price changes. However, in the example, attendance increased with a price increase, indicating that the demand is not perfectly inelastic.

- **Option E: The law of demand remains intact**  
  This option is incorrect because the example clearly shows that the law of demand is being challenged by the upward-sloping demand curve.

- **Option F: The law of demand is irrelevant in this scenario**  
  This is incorrect because the example provides clear evidence that the law of demand is being challenged.

- **Option G: The change in attendance is due to factors other than price**  
  This option suggests that the change in attendance is not solely due to the price increase, which is plausible. However, it does not directly address whether the law of demand is being challenged.

- **Option H: The change in attendance is due to factors other than price**  
  While this option highlights possible reasons for the attendance increase, it does not directly explain the contradiction with the law of demand.

- **Option I: The law of demand remains intact**  
  This is incorrect because the example contradicts the law of demand.

- **Option J: The increase in attendance was a coincidence unrelated to the price change**  
  This is not supported by the scenario, as attendance increased when the price increased.

### Conclusion:
The example shows that the demand curve is upward-sloping, which directly contradicts the law of demand. Therefore, the correct answer is **Option A: The demand curve is upward-sloping**.
