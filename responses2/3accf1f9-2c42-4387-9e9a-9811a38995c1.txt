Okay, so I've got this question about bond order comparing He2 and He2+. Hmm, I remember bond order is important for understanding the stability and bond strength of diatomic molecules. But wait, He2 is helium, right? And I think He has a different electron configuration compared to other elements.

Wait, helium has an atomic number of 2, so its electron configuration is [He]. So He2 would be He2^0, meaning neutral. Oh wait, but when we talk about He2, I think it's just He2, which is He2^0. So for He2, the molecular formula is He2, which has two He atoms. Each He atom has 2 electrons. So He2 has a total of 4 electrons.

But wait, in He2, the structure would be He2: He2. So two He atoms, each with 2 electrons, making a total of 4 electrons. Wait, but He2 has a bond order. How do we find that?

I think the formula to calculate bond order is (number of bonding electrons - number of antibonding electrons) divided by 2. So I need to write the electron configuration for He2.

He has an atomic number of 2, so its atomic orbitals are 1s² 2s². But when you have He2, which is He2, the total electrons are 4. So the molecular orbital configuration would be 1s² 2s²? Wait, no, because He2 is a diatomic molecule, so each He atom contributes one electron to each orbital.

Wait, in molecular orbital theory, the configuration for He2 is something like two electrons in the 1s orbital and two in the 2s. So for He2, the molecular orbitals would be filled as:

1s² 2s².

Wait, but in He2, since each He atom contributes one electron, the molecular orbitals would be different. Let me think. Each He atom has 2 electrons, so He2 has 4 electrons. The molecular orbitals would start with 1s, 2s, and then 2p, right?

Wait, no. For He2, the electrons would fill the bonding orbitals first. So the order is 1s, 2s, then 2p. But wait, wait. The molecular orbitals for He2 would be 1s² 2s². So that's all bonding. So the bond order would be (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons) / 2.

Wait, bonding electrons would be all the electrons in bonding orbitals, and antibonding would be any in antibonding. But in He2, how are the orbitals filled?

Wait, He2 has 4 electrons. The molecular orbitals are filled as 1s² 2s². So all four electrons are in the bonding orbitals (since 1s is lower energy than 2s). Wait no, wait. Molecular orbitals for He₂ are filled as 1s² 2s². So each molecular orbital holds two electrons with opposite spins.

So bonding electrons would be (bonding) 4? Because both 1s and 2s are bonding. So bonding electrons: 2 electrons in 1s (each paired) and 2 in 2s (each paired). So bonding electrons = 2 (from 1s) + 2 (from 2s) = 4. Wait, but that seems high. Wait, the molecular orbitals are filled in a way that each orbital holds two electrons. So for He2:

Electron configuration is 1s² 2s².

Wait, so the total bonding electrons are 2 (from 1s) + 2 (from 2s) = 4. But wait, each bonding orbital holds two electrons. So each of the two bonding orbitals (1s and 2s) has two electrons each. So bonding electrons are 2 (1s) × 2 (each orbital holds two) = 4? Hmm, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider each molecular orbital's electron count. The 1s orbital can hold two electrons, and the 2s can hold two. So for He2, 4 electrons in total. So 1s² and 2s².

So bonding electrons are in the lower energy orbitals. So 1s and 2s are both bonding. Each of these orbitals holds two electrons, so bonding electrons are 2 (1s) + 2 (2s) = 4. Antibonding electrons are zero because all electrons are in bonding orbitals.

So bond order is (4 - 0)/2 = 2. Wait, but wait. I thought He2 is a diatomic molecule with a bond order of 2. But wait, wait, I'm getting a bond order of 2. But wait, I thought He2 has a bond order of 2. But wait, perhaps I'm mixing it up with another diatomic.

Wait, let me think again. The bond order for He₂ is 2, which is correct because it's a stable molecule. So He₂ has a bond order of 2.

Now, He₂+ has an extra positive charge. So He₂ has 4 electrons, He₂+ has 3 electrons. So how does that affect the molecular orbitals?

Wait, He₂ has 4 electrons. So He₂+ has 3 electrons. But how are they arranged? For He₂+, the molecular orbital configuration may change.

Wait, in molecular orbital theory, the energy levels for He₂ are 1s² 2s². For He₂+, the number of electrons is 3. So the first molecular orbital (1s) is filled with 2 electrons, and the second (2s) will have 1 electron. Because electrons fill the lower orbitals first according to Hund's rule.

Wait, so He₂+ would have 3 electrons: 2 in 1s, 1 in 2s. So the electron configuration is 1s² 2s¹.

So now, for bond order calculation. Bonding electrons are in lower orbitals. So 1s² (two electrons) and 2s¹ (one electron). But wait, bonding orbitals would hold electrons in bonding. So for He₂+, the bonding electrons are in 1s² and 2s¹? No, wait. No, the molecular orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy, and bonding would be the lower ones.

Wait, but in He₂+, the electrons would be in the 1s and 2s, but since there's a positive charge, maybe the 1s is higher in energy or something. Or perhaps the 1s is lower, so the electrons fill 1s first.

Wait, perhaps the molecular orbital for He₂+ would be 1s² 2s¹. So all three electrons are in the 1s and 2s orbitals.

But wait, bond order is calculated as (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2. Let's see.

In He₂+, electrons are in 1s² 2s¹. The 1s is a bonding orbital, and 2s is a bonding orbital. So bonding electrons are all the electrons in these orbitals.

So bonding electrons = 2 (from 1s) + 1 (from 2s) = 3.

Now, what about antibonding electrons? There are none, because all electrons are in bonding orbitals.

So bond order = (3 - 0)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5.

So He₂ has a bond order of 2, and He₂+ has bond order 1.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says bond order of He₂ is 2 and He₂+ is 1.5. So that would be option D. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, another way to calculate bond order is using the formula:

Bond order = (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2.

In He₂: 4 electrons total. All in bonding (2 in 1s, 2 in 2s). So bonding =4, antibonding=0. So BO=2.

He₂+ has 3 electrons. 2 in 1s, 1 in 2s. So bonding=3, antibonding=0. BO=3/2=1.5.

So the bond orders are 2 and 1.5 respectively.

Now, looking at the options:

Looking at option D: Bond order of He₂ is 2 and He₂+ is 1.5. That's correct.

But wait, another thought: when He₂+ gains an extra positive charge, does that affect the molecular orbitals differently? Like, according to some theories, adding a positive charge would cause the 1s orbital to be higher in energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, in the molecular orbital for He₂+, the 1s and 2s orbitals are both filled, but because of the positive charge, the 1s orbital is actually higher in energy than before. Wait, but wait, in molecular orbital theory, the order of orbitals is 1s, 2s, 2p, etc., regardless of the atomic filling. So if there's a charge, the 1s orbital is still lower in energy than 2s. So in He₂+, the 1s and 2s orbitals are filled, but how does that affect the bonding and antibonding electrons?

Wait, regardless of the charge, the molecular orbitals are the same. The charge affects the ionization energy, but the molecular orbital configuration remains. So for He₂+, the calculation of bond order remains as 3/2.

So the bond order of He₂ is 2, and He₂+ is 1.5. That's option D.

To compare the bond order of He₂ and He₂⁺, we analyze their molecular orbital configurations and calculate bond order using the formula:

\text{Bond Order} = \frac{\text{Bonding electrons} - \text{Antibonding electrons}}{2}.
