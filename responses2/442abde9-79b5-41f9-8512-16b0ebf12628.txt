Okay, so I've got this question about earnings per share (EPS). Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says that a company has a profit to common shareholders of $4,750 and has 1,000 shares outstanding. They're asking for the EPS. I remember that EPS is calculated by taking the net income or profit and dividing it by the number of outstanding shares. So the formula is EPS = Net Income / Shares outstanding.

Let me plug in the numbers. The net income is $4,750, and the number of shares is 1,000. So I divide 4,750 by 1,000. Hmm, 4,750 divided by 1,000. Well, 1,000 goes into 4,750 four times because 4*1,000 is 4,000. That leaves 750. So that would be 4.75. So the EPS is $4.75. 

Looking at the options, option D is $4.75. So the correct answer should be D. 

Wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. No, that seems right. 4,750 divided by 1,000 is definitely 4.75. So yes, D is the right choice.

The earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net income by the number of outstanding shares. The company's net income is $4,750, and there are 1,000 shares outstanding. 

EPS = $4,750 / 1,000 = $4.75.

The correct answer is D: $4.75.
