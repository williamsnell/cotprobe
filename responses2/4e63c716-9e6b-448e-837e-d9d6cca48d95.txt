Okay, so I've got this finance problem here about calculating the NPV of an investment project. Hmm, I remember NPV stands for Net Present Value, which is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the initial investment. The formula I think is NPV = sum of (Cash Inflow / (1 + r)^t) for each period plus the initial outflow.

Alright, let's see the problem again. The project costs $500 today. It will generate $500 in year five and year ten. The discount rate is 10%. So I need to calculate the present value of the $500 in year 5 and year 10, then subtract the initial $500 cost.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. The initial investment is outflow, so that's a negative. The inflows are positive. So NPV = (PV of year 5) + (PV of year 10) - Initial Cost.

Calculating each PV separately. The formula for present value is PV = FV / (1 + r)^t.

For year 5: FV is $500, t=5, r=10% which is 0.10. So 500 / (1.1)^5.

Let me compute (1.1)^5 first. 1.1 to the power of 5: 1.61051. So 500 / 1.61051 ≈ 310.498. Hmm, so approximately $310.50.

For year 10: FV is $500, t=10, r=0.10. (1.1)^10 is about 2.5937. So 500 / 2.5937 ≈ 192.77.

Adding those two PVs: 310.50 + 192.77 = 503.27. Then subtract the initial $500 cost. So 503.27 - 500 = 3.27.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option J is $3. But wait, that's approximate. Let me check my calculations more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should compute more precisely. Let me calculate (1.1)^5 again. 1.1^5 is 1.61051. 500 / 1.61051 = exactly 310.498 (approx).

1.1^10 is 2.5937. So 500 / 2.5937 is approximately 192.773.

Adding them: 310.498 + 192.773 = 503.271.

Subtracting 500: 503.271 - 500 = 3.271, which is approximately $3.27. But the options don't have a choice with 3.27. Oh wait, let me look again.

Wait the options are A to J. Option J is $3. So is this $3.27 approximately $3. So I think the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Maybe I should use a calculator method.

Alternatively, let me compute the two PVs more accurately.

Year 5: 500 / (1.1)^5. Let me compute (1.1)^5: 1.61051. So 500 ÷ 1.61051 is approximately 310.498.

Year 10: 500 / (1.1)^10. (1.1)^10 is 2.59374246. So 500 ÷ 2.59374246 is approximately 192.771.

Adding: 310.498 + 192.771 = 503.269. Subtract 500: 3.269. So approximately $3.27.

But the options don't have a choice with 3.27, but option J is $3. So maybe it's rounded down, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought. Maybe I should use the exact number for PVs. Let's see, perhaps I should use more accurate calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula in another way. Let's see, perhaps the PV of each cash flow is exact.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about this again. The initial investment is $500, so that's a cash outflow. The inflows are in five and ten years, so those are positive cash flows.

So NPV = PV(5) + PV(10) - 500.

Wait, so let me compute each PV accurately.

Year 5: PV = 500 / (1.1)^5. Let me compute (1.1)^5:

1.1^1 = 1.1

1.1^2 = 1.21

1.1^3 = 1.331

1.1^4 = 1.4641

1.1^5 = 1.61051

So 500 / 1.61051 = let's compute this division more accurately.

500 ÷ 1.61051 = ?

Well, 1.61051 * 300 = 483.153. 500 - 483.153 = 16.847. So 300 + (16.847 / 1.61051) ≈ 300 + 10.45 ≈ 310.45.

So PV(5) ≈ $310.45.

PV(10): 500 / (1.1)^10.

1.1^10 is 2.59374246. So 500 ÷ 2.59374246.

Well, 2.59374246 * 192 = 2.59374246 * 200 is 518.748, so 192 * 2.59374246 is 2.59374246 * (200-8) = 518.748 - 2.59374246*8 = 518.748 - 20.7499397 = 497.998. So 192 gives 498. So 500 is 2 more, so 192 + 2/2.59374246. 2/2.59374246 is approximately 0.773. So PV(10) ≈ 192.773.

So the total PV is 310.45 + 192.773 = 503.223. Subtract the initial $500: 503.223 - 500 = 3.223. So about $3.22.

Looking at the options, option J is $3. Since it's approximately $3, option J is correct.

The project's NPV is calculated as the present value of future cash inflows minus the initial investment. The cash inflows of $500 occur in year 5 and year 10, with a discount rate of 10%. The present value of each inflow is calculated using the formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^t}
\]

For year 5:
\[
PV_5 = \frac{500}{(1.10)^5} = \frac{500}{1.61051} \approx 310.45
\]

For year 10:
\[
PV_{10} = \frac{500}{(1.10)^{10}} = \frac{500}{2.59374246} \approx 192.77
\]

The total present value of the inflows is:
\[
PV_{\text{total}} = 310.45 + 192.77 \approx 503.22
\]

Subtracting the initial investment:
\[
NPV = 503.22 - 500 = 3.22
\]

The closest option to $3.22 is $3. Therefore, the correct answer is:
