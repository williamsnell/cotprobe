Question:

When a swimmer leaves cold water on a warm, breezy day, he experiences a cooling effect. Why?

Options:

A: The cold water causes a decrease in the swimmer's metabolic rate.
B: The swimmer feels cold due to the temperature difference.
C: Evaporation of water from the swimmer's skin cools the body down.
D: The swimmer feels cold due to the wind chill factor.
E: The swimmer's body is adapting to the water temperature after exiting.
F: The water removes heat from the swimmer's body.
G: The sun's rays are less effective on the swimmer's wet skin.
H: The water on the swimmer's body freezes.
I: The breeze makes the swimmer feel cold.
J: The swimmer's body temperature drops below normal.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why a swimmer leaving cold water on a warm, breezy day experiences a cooling effect. Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, I remember that when you're in cold water, especially on a warm day, you feel a lot of coolness. I think this has to do with the temperature difference between your skin and the water. But wait, how exactly does that happen?

So, when someone is in water, the water's temperature can affect their body. If the water is colder than their skin, it should cold them down. But why is that the case? I think it's because water has a higher heat capacity. That means it can absorb more heat from the skin than the surrounding air. 

Let me think about the options. Option C says the evaporation of water from the skin cools the body. Evaporation is a process where water turns into vapor and loses heat. So, as the swimmer's skin evaporates, it takes heat away, making them feel cooler. That makes sense. 

Option B is about the temperature difference. That's a possibility, but it's more of a general explanation. The question is asking why it's happening specifically when leaving cold water. So the answer should be about the evaporation process rather than just the temperature difference being there.

Looking at the other options: A talks about metabolic rate, but I don't think that's right. The swimmer's body's temperature is probably the main factor here. E is about the breeze. I don't remember breeze being the main reason for the cooling effect. The wind chill effect is more about how cold it feels, but that's also due to the temperature difference. 

Option F says the water removes heat. That's similar to C. So both C and F are possible. Wait, the question is about why the swimmer feels cold. So evaporation is the process that's causing the cooling. So option C is the correct reason. 

Wait, but why would the water be cooler than the swimmer's skin? Because the swimmer leaves it in cold water, which is warmer than the surrounding air. So the water is at a lower temperature than the air, which is warmer. Thus, the swimmer's skin is hotter than the water, causing the water to cool the skin. 

So, the main reason is the evaporation of water from the swimmer's skin, which takes heat away. That's C. So the correct answer should be C.

The swimmer feels cold when leaving cold water because the water's temperature is lower than the swimmer's skin, causing the water to cool the body. This happens through the evaporation of water from the skin, which absorbs heat and reduces the swimmer's body temperature.

Answer: C
