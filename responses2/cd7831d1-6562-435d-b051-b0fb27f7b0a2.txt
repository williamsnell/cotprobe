Okay, so I've got this problem here about a soccer team trying to buy as many soccer balls as possible with their budget. Let me see how to approach this.

The question says the team has $90.00, and each soccer ball costs $15.60. I need to find the maximum number they can buy. Hmm, so I guess I need to divide the total money by the cost per ball.

Let me write that down. So 90 divided by 15.60. Wait, what's 15.60 times 5? Let me calculate 15.60 * 5. 15 times 5 is 75, and 0.60 times 5 is 3, so that's 78. So 5 balls would cost $78.00. That leaves 90 - 78 = $12. So with the remaining $12, can they buy another ball? Let's see, 15.60 is more than 12, so no. So 5 is the maximum?

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I should do the division more accurately. Let me compute 90 / 15.6. Let's do this step by step.

15.60 goes into 90 how many times? Let me think of it as 1560 divided by 156. Because 1560 ÷ 156. 156 times 5 is 780. 156 times 6 is 936, which is too much because 936 is more than 900. So 5 times 156 is 780. 156*5=780. So 900 divided by 156: 5 times 156 is 780, which leaves 120 (since 900-780=120). Wait, no, 900 is 9*100, and 156 is about 1.56*100, so 900 /156 ≈ 5.617.

So 5.617 balls is the exact number, but since you can't buy a fraction of a ball, the maximum is 5. So that would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again. 15.60 * 5 = 78.00. 90-78 is 12. So that's not enough for another ball, which costs 15.60. So yes, 5 is the maximum.

Looking at the options, option C is 5, so that should be the answer.

The team has $90.00 and each soccer ball costs $15.60. To find the greatest number of balls they can buy, divide the total money by the cost per ball: $90 ÷ $15.60 = 5.617. Since they can't buy a fraction of a ball, the maximum is 5. 

Answer: C: 5
