Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. So, the question is about two masses colliding and sticking together. I remember that when objects collide and stick, it's a perfectly inelastic collision. 

The masses are m1 = 5 kg and m2 = 10 kg. Their velocities are u1 = 2 m/s in the +x direction and u2 = 4 m/s in the +y direction. I need to find their final velocity after the collision. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one. 

Wait, right, so momentum is conserved in collisions, right? Because in an isolated system, momentum before equals momentum after. So I should calculate the total momentum before the collision and then find the final momentum, which would have the same magnitude but different direction.

Momentum is a vector, so I'll have to break it into x and y components. 

For mass m1, it's moving only in the x-direction. So initial momentum in x is m1 * u1x. m1 is 5 kg, u1x is 2 m/s. So that's 5*2 = 10 kg·m/s. But wait, I think I should write it as a vector. So it's (10, 0) kg·m/s.

For mass m2, it's moving only in the y-direction. Initial momentum in y is m2 * u2y. m2 is 10 kg, u2y is 4 m/s. So that's 10*4 =40 kg·m/s. So the vector is (0, 40) kg·m/s.

So total initial momentum is the sum of these two. Adding x and y components: (10, 40) kg·m/s.

After collision, the two masses stick together, so their combined mass is m1 + m2 = 5 +10 =15 kg. Let's call this m =15 kg.

The final momentum vector should be equal to the initial total momentum vector. So final momentum is (10,40) kg·m/s.

But wait, the direction of this momentum will give the direction of the final velocity. So to find the magnitude, I can compute the square root of (10^2 +40^2), and then divide by the mass.

Wait, no, wait. Because the momentum is the mass times velocity, so the velocity will be the momentum divided by the mass. So the final velocity vector would be (10/15, 40/15) in m/s.

Wait, let me calculate that. 10/15 is 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 m/s in the x-direction. 40/15 is 8/3 ≈2.6667 m/s in the y-direction.

So the final velocity vector is (2/3, 8/3) m/s.

Now, to find the magnitude of this velocity, which is the final speed. The formula is sqrt( (2/3)^2 + (8/3)^2 ). Let's compute that.

(2/3)^2 is 4/9, (8/3)^2 is 64/9. Adding them gives (4+64)/9 =68/9. The square root of 68/9 is sqrt(68)/3. Sqrt(68) is sqrt(4*17) )= 2*sqrt(17). So it's (2*sqrt(17))/3.

Wait, sqrt(17) is about 4.123. So 2*4.123 is 8.246, divided by 3 is roughly 2.748 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 3.000, H:2.900, G:2.25, etc. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computation.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. 10 squared is 100, 40 squared is 1600. Sum is 1700. Square root of 1700 is about 41.23, divided by 15. Wait, wait, no, because the velocity is 10/15 and 40/15, so 10/15 is 2/3 ≈0.6667, 40/15≈2.6667. So the magnitude is sqrt( (0.6667)^2 + (2.6667)^2 ). 

Calculating each part: 0.6667 squared is about 0.4444, 2.6667 squared is about 7.1111. Adding together: 7.5555. Square root of 7.5555 is approximately 2.75 m/s. Because 2.75 squared is 7.5625, which is close to 7.5555. So the final speed is approximately 2.75 m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.750 m/s. So the correct answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision. The masses and velocities are as follows:

- Mass \( m_1 = 5 \, \text{kg} \), velocity \( \vec{u}_1 = 2 \, \text{m/s} \) in the \( +x \)-direction.
- Mass \( m_2 = 10 \, \text{kg} \), velocity \( \vec{u}_2 = 4 \, \text{m/s} \) in the \( +y \)-direction.

### Step 1: Calculate initial momentum components
The initial momentum is a vector sum of the momenta of the two masses:
- Momentum in the \( x \)-direction: \( p_{1x} = m_1 u_{1x} = 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \, \text{kg·m/s} \).
- Momentum in the \( y \)-direction: \( p_{2y} = m_2 u_{2y} = 10 \cdot 4 = 40 \, \text{kg·m/s} \).

The total initial momentum is:
\[
\vec{p}_{\text{initial}} = (10, 40) \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the final mass and velocity
After the collision, the two masses stick together, so the combined mass is:
\[
m = m_1 + m_2 = 5 + 10 = 15 \, \text{kg}.
\]

The final momentum vector must equal the initial total momentum vector. Thus, the final velocity vector \( \vec{v} \) is given by:
\[
\vec{v} = \frac{\vec{p}_{\text{initial}}}{m} = \left( \frac{10}{15}, \frac{40}{15} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{3}, \frac{8}{3} \right) \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the magnitude of the final velocity
The magnitude of the velocity is:
\[
v = \sqrt{\left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{8}{3} \right)^2}.
\]

Breaking it down:
\[
\left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}, \quad \left( \frac{8}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{64}{9}.
\]

Adding these:
\[
\frac{4}{9} + \frac{64}{9} = \frac{68}{9}.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{68}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{68}}{3}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{68} \approx 8.246 \), we get:
\[
v \approx \frac{8.246}{3} \approx 2.75 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 2.75 \, \text{m/s} \) is **A: 2.750 m/sec**.
