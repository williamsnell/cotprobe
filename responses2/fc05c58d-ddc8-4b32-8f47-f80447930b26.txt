Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement is correct.

The question has two statements and four options about their truth values. Let's look at each statement one by one.

Statement 1 says: If a finite group has order n, then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n. Wait, I remember something called Lagrange's theorem. Oh right, Lagrange's theorem states that in a finite group, the order (number of elements) of any subgroup divides the order of the group. Also, the theorem says that if d divides n, then there exists a subgroup of order d. So statement 1 is definitely true.

Statement 2 says: If an element a belongs to a finite group, then the order of a divides the order of the group. That's again Lagrange's theorem. Because the cyclic subgroup generated by a has order equal to the order of a. So yes, statement 2 is true as well.

Wait, but there's a catch. I remember that Lagrange's theorem applies to finite groups. So both statements are about finite groups and their properties. So statement 1 is about the existence of subgroups for every divisor, and statement 2 is about the order of elements.

Looking back at the options, the options are combinations of the two statements. So the possible correct answers are options where both statements are true or both are false.

Option A: True, True â†’ That's possible because both statements are true.

Other options: For example, option F is False, False, which would mean both statements are false. But earlier I thought both are true. Let me confirm.

Wait, Statement 1 is about the existence of subgroups, which is true because of Lagrange's theorem. Statement 2 is about the order of elements, which is also a direct application of Lagrange's theorem. So both statements are true.

So possibilities are:

A: Both statements are true. That would mean the answer is A.

Looking at the options, option A is the first option, which is "True, True." So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure. Are there any exceptions or cases where these statements might not hold? For example, Statement 1: Consider the symmetric group S3, which has order 6. Its divisors are 1,2,3,6. Does it have subgroups of order 2 and 3? Yes: the subgroup of order 3 is cyclic generated by a 3-cycle, and the subgroup of order 2 is generated by a transposition. So statement 1 holds.

Statement 2: In any finite group, for any element a, the order of a divides the order of the group. Yep, because the cyclic subgroup generated by a has order equal to the order of a, and Lagrange's theorem says that the order must divide the group's order. So statement 2 is definitely true.

So, both statements are true. So the correct answer should be option A.

The correct answer is A: True, True. Both statements are true. 

Answer: A
