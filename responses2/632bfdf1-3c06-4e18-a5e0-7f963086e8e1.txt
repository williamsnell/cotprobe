Question:

A man and a woman were partners in an automobile leasing agency. For some time, the man had been embezzling money from the agency. The woman became suspicious and told the man that she wanted to engage an accounting firm to audit the agency's books. In a panic to prevent the audit and avoid being discovered, the man decided to have the woman killed. He contacted a professional killer and hired him to kill the woman for $10,000. A short time later, the woman died in a car crash arranged by the killer. In addition to embezzlement, of what crime or crimes may the man properly be convicted?

Options:

A: Conspiracy and solicitation.
B: Solicitation and conspiracy.
C: Conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.
D: Embezzlement and solicitation.
E: Murder.
F: No additional crimes, only embezzlement.
G: Solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.
H: Conspiracy, embezzlement, and murder.
I: Conspiracy and murder.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a man who embezzled money and then decided to kill his partner. The question is about what crimes he could be convicted of besides embezzlement. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that embezzlement is a specific type of fraud. It's when someone else's money is misappropriated for their own business. So that's clear. The man was part of an automobile leasing agency. He embezzled, so that's definitely a crime.

Now, the man had the woman suspicious and wanted her to have an accountants audit the agency's books. The woman was looking to get a better job, maybe. The man was in a panic to prevent the audit, so he decided to kill her. He called a killer and took her out for $10k. Then she died in a car crash arranged by the killer. 

So the key here is the steps he took. He had the woman involved in a audit, which is a big deal—solicitation of accounts. That's another crime. But wait, he's acting as a killer, so he's committing murder. But wait, he's a professional killer, so he's the killer. But when he kills her, what's that about? Is that a separate crime? Or is it the same as the audit?

Wait, I think the key point here is that he's acting as the killer. So when he kills her, he's committing murder. But how does that relate to the other crimes? The question is about what additional crimes he could be convicted of besides embezzlement.

So, the man was involved in embezzlement, which is a crime. He had the woman involved in a audit (solicitation), which is another crime. Then he decided to kill her, which would be murder.

But wait, when he killed her, was that the same as the audit? Or was the audit another reason he didn't want her to be audited? If he wanted her to be audited, perhaps that's a reason he didn't want her involved, but when he killed her, he's committing the murder.

Wait, but in the scenario, he's the killer, so he's killed her. So when he killed her, was that a separate crime? I think yes. The murder itself would be a separate crime. So that's one more crime.

But wait, what about the fact that the man was acting in a panic to prevent the audit. The audit was a reason why he wanted her to be audited. But when he killed her, he was committing murder. So that's murder. So that's another crime.

Wait, but maybe he's committing a combination of the audit and the murder. But no, because the question is about what he may be convicted of besides embezzlement. So, what else could he be convicted of?

Wait, let's think about the possible crimes. The options are about combinations of these crimes.

Option A is conspiracy and solicitation. I'm not sure. Did he commit any conspiracy? Like maybe they agreed, but I don't think he's part of that. He's just acting alone, so that's not conspiracy. He had the woman involved in a audit, which is a separate crime.

Option B is solicitation and conspiracy. So if he had any of that. I don't think so. The man was acting alone, not forming any conspiracy.

Option C: conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. That's a lot. But did he commit any of these? He had the woman involved in a audit, which is a specific kind of solicitation, so that's one. He committed embezzlement. He also killed her, which is murder. But is that all? Are there any other crimes?

Option E says only murder. Well, that can't be right because he had embezzlement, which is a specific crime.

Option F: No additional crimes, only embezzlement. That's not correct because he committed more.

Option G: Solicitation and embezzlement. Maybe? Because he had the woman involved in a audit. But when he killed her, that's a separate crime—murder. So G would be incorrect because he killed her for $10k, which is murder, not embezzlement.

Option H: conspiracy and murder. But did he commit any conspiracy? I don't think so. He was acting alone.

Option I: conspiracy and murder. Same as H.

Looking back, the man was the victim of the audit. He didn't commit any of these except for embezzlement, the audit, and then murder. So what are the other possible crimes?

Wait, maybe the fact that he didn't want her to be audited is a reason for an adjacent or implied contract? Like, if he didn't want her audited, perhaps that's a mutual intent to commit a crime. But that's more about intent to commit, which is a different kind of crime. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe he had some kind of implied consent. But no, the legal system usually doesn't consider implied consent in this context.

Wait, another thought. Did he commit the murder as part of his actions? So he's the killer, so he's the one who killed her. That's murder. So that's one more.

So, the crimes would be embezzlement, the audit (which is a specific kind of solicitation), and murder. But then, are there any other possible crimes?

Wait, could the fact that he had the woman involved in a audit and then decided to kill her be considered as a separate crime, like implied consent or something? I don't think so. The question is about what he may be convicted of besides embezzlement.

So the possible options are:

Option C says conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. But did he commit any of those? He did embezzlement, and he had the woman involved in a audit—so that's a specific kind of solicitation. He then killed her, which is murder.

Wait, but is the act of killing her considered a separate crime? Or is that separate from the audit? Because the audit was a reason he didn't want her to be audited, but when he killed her, it's a completely different action.

So, in that case, he's guilty of embezzlement, the audit (so that's related to the audit), and murder.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that includes all these. Let me check the options.

Looking back:

Option C: conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.

So, does the man have any of these? He's the killer, so no conspiracy or solicitation. He had the woman involved in a audit, which is a specific kind of solicitation. He killed her — that's murder.

So, would that make option C correct? But option C includes conspiracy, which he didn't do that. So he may not be guilty of conspiracy.

Wait, but another angle: the scenario. He was in a situation where he had a partner who was suspicious. The man had the woman involved in a audit. Now he decided to kill her. So maybe he's the one who knew the audit was going to happen and then decided to take her out. But I don't see how that would trigger any particular crime.

Alternatively, perhaps the man knew he was being audited, so when he decided to kill her, he was acting in a way that's a separate crime. But I'm not sure if that's a recognized crime. Maybe the key is that he had to commit the murder, so that's another.

Wait, another thought. The man's actions were motivated by the fear of being audited. But when he actually decided to kill her, that's just a separate act. So that wouldn't automatically make him guilty of the audit or the murder.

Wait, but did the fact that he knew the audit was going to happen and then decided to kill her, which could be an implied consent? Or was it just a legal act?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the possible legal elements. The man's actions include:

1. Embezzlement: He misappropriated funds.
2. Having the woman involved in a audit (solicitation): He had the woman's business interests at risk.
3. Deciding to kill her: murder.

So, the possible crimes would be embezzlement, the audit (so that's a specific kind of solicitation), and murder.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes these is C. But option C also includes conspiracy. Did he commit any conspiracy? Not that I can see. He was just the killer.

Wait, perhaps another angle. He had the woman involved in a audit, which is a specific type of fraud, so that's a separate crime. Then, when he decided to kill her, that's murder. So the possible crimes are embezzlement, the audit, and murder.

Looking at the options, the one that includes embezzlement and the audit is option C. But wait, option C has conspiracy, which he didn't commit. So that can't be.

Wait, let me double-check the options.

Option A: conspiracy and solicitation. So if he had a conspiracy to have her audit, then that would be included. But in the scenario, he was acting alone, so no conspiracy.

Option B: solicitation and conspiracy. No, he didn't commit any of that.

Option C: conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. So he did embezzlement, and he had the audit (so that's a specific form of solicitation), and he did the murder.

But wait, the options don't have any option that includes all these except option C, which includes conspiracy. So perhaps he's only guilty of embezzlement and the audit (so option D). Wait, option D is embezzlement and solicitation, but the man didn't commit any of that except what I thought was the audit.

Wait, but the question says "what may the man properly be convicted of?" So the options are possible additional crimes beyond embezzlement.

So, the man is guilty of embezzlement. He also had the woman involved in a audit, which is a specific form of solicitation. Then, when he killed her, that's murder.

So, the possible additional crimes are the audit and the murder. So, the correct options that include these would be option C, which includes embezzlement, the audit (solicitation), and murder. But option C also includes conspiracy, which he didn't commit.

Wait, another thought. Did the fact that he had the woman involved in an audit and then decided to kill her mean anything? Maybe he knew he was going to be audited, and then decided to kill her, which is a separate act. So, perhaps he's guilty of murder. But is that considered to be a separate crime?

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that he had the woman involved in a audit means he had a duty to prevent it, but he didn't do that. So he's just the killer, which would be murder. So that's a separate crime.

So, putting it all together, the possible crimes are embezzlement, the audit (solicitation), and murder.

Looking for an option that includes embezzlement, the audit, and murder. But none of the options have all four except option C, which includes conspiracy. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the act of killing her is considered a separate crime, but the question is about what additional crimes he can be convicted of beyond embezzlement.

So, the possible options are those that include the other crimes. So, if he was involved in the audit, that's a specific form of embezzlement. He killed her, that's murder. So, the correct answer would be that he's guilty of embezzlement and the audit (which is a separate form of embezzlement), and murder.

But looking at the options, option C includes conspiracy (which he didn't commit), so that may not be correct.

Wait, in the scenario, the man was in a situation where the woman was suspicious. He had the woman involved in a audit, which is a specific form of fraud. Then he decided to kill her. So the man may be convicted of embezzlement, the audit (solicitation), and murder. However, none of the options have that combination except option C, which includes more.

Wait, but option C says conspiracy, which he didn't do. So he isn't guilty of that. So maybe he's only guilty of embezzlement, and the audit is just a separate form of embezzlement, and the murder is a separate crime.

Looking at the options, the only one that includes embezzlement and the audit (but no option with that) is option C. But wait, option C also includes murder. So maybe the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes conspiracy and solicitation. But that doesn't seem right because the man didn't commit any of those.

Wait, another approach. The possible crimes the man can be convicted of are embezzlement, the audit (which is a specific form of embezzlement), and murder. So the possible options are:

- Option C includes embezzlement, the audit, and murder, but with conspiracy. So if he's the killer, he's guilty of each of the crimes except conspiracy. So the correct options would be embezzlement (from the audit) and the audit (another form of embezzlement), plus murder.

But none of the options have just embezzlement and the audit. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which includes these plus conspiracy, but if he didn't commit any of those, then maybe it's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the man is guilty of embezzlement and the audit, but no option includes both. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which includes more than he actually committed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the answer options again.

The possible correct answer is option C: conspiracy and solicitation. No, because he didn't commit either.

Option E: Murder. That's a separate crime, but that's not the additional one.

Wait, the question is: what may the man be convicted of besides embezzlement.

So, besides embezzlement, the man can be convicted of:

- The audit as a form of embezzlement.

- Murder.

So, any option that includes both embezzlement and the audit (and/or murder) would be correct.

Looking at the options, option C includes embezzlement, the audit (so that's a specific form), and murder.

So, if the man is guilty of all three, but the options don't have an option that includes all except one, perhaps option C is the correct answer.

Wait, let me review the options:

Option C: conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder.

So, the man has no conspiracy, no solicitation, but he did embezzlement and the audit (so that's a separate form), and he did murder.

So, the only options that include embezzlement and the audit are none except option C, which includes more.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because he may be convicted of embezzlement, the audit (which is a separate form), and murder.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the act of killing the woman is considered a separate crime, but the options don't include that. So, the correct answer would be embezzlement and the audit (which is a form of embezzlement), plus murder. So, the options don't have an option that includes all three except option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because he is guilty of embezzlement and the audit (so that's two), but the question says "what may the man properly be convicted of" — so the man may be convicted of embezzlement and the audit (so option C includes those plus conspiracy, which he didn't commit, so perhaps that's incorrect).

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, as he may be guilty of embezzlement, the audit, and murder, but the option includes another form of embezzlement. But the options don't have that.

I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to recall what's covered in my notes.

In criminal law, if someone misappropriates funds (embezzlement), they are guilty of that. If they have someone involved in a fraud (like auditing), that can be a separate crime. In some jurisdictions, imputations or implied consent can be used, but the question doesn't suggest that.

In this scenario, the man is the one who did the killing. So, he is guilty of murder. So the only additional crimes beyond embezzlement are the audit (solicitation) and the murder.

Looking at the options, none have just embezzlement and the audit. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but it includes conspiracy. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C because it's the only one that includes the audit as a form of embezzlement.

Wait, but the question is about what he may be convicted of besides embezzlement. So, the additional crimes are the audit and the murder.

Looking at the options, option C includes embezzlement, the audit (which is a form of embezzlement), and murder. So, if the man is guilty of all three, then option C would be the answer. But the question is about what "may" he be convicted of besides embezzlement. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, another approach: The man's actions include embezzlement, the audit (so that's a separate form), and murder. So, any option that includes these three would be correct. Looking at the options, only option C includes these three. But he didn't commit any of them except for the audit.

Wait, perhaps the fact that he had the woman involved in a audit doesn't mean he's guilty of that form of embezzlement. So, perhaps he's only guilty of embezzlement, and the audit is a separate offense. So, the correct answer would be option C, which includes embezzlement, the audit, and murder, but also includes conspiracy, which he didn't commit.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering that the act was a separate crime. So, he's guilty of embezzlement, and the audit is a separate crime, so that's option C's embezzlement and the audit. But the options don't have an option that includes both.

Hmm, I'm going to have to make a best guess here. The correct answer is option C because it lists the audit (solicitation), embezzlement, and murder as the possible additional crimes, but he may not have committed the conspiracy part.

Wait, but the man may be convicted of embezzlement and the audit (as part of it), and also of murder. So, the correct option would be C, which includes these three, even though he didn't commit conspiracy.

But wait, the question is about what he may be convicted of besides embezzlement. So, the additional crimes could be the audit and the murder. Among the options, option C includes embezzlement, the audit, and murder, so that's correct.
</think>

The man may be convicted of embezzlement and the audit (as a specific form of embezzlement), plus murder. Among the provided options, **option C** correctly includes these crimes: conspiracy, solicitation, embezzlement, and murder. However, the man did not commit conspiracy, so the inclusion of conspiracy in option C may not be accurate. 

ANSWER: C
