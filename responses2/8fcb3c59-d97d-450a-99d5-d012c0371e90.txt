Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Suppose Q is a measure of output, K is a measure of capital stock in use, and L is a measure of the size of the employed labor force. Q =AK^\betaL^\gamma is a much used form of production function. When \beta + \gamma = 1, it is known as a Cobb-Douglas production function. This function has many convenient properties: Marginal products of both labor and capital are positive if \beta and \gamma are. If \beta + \gamma = 1, the function has constant returns to scale. That is, if both inputs are increased in like proportion, output will increase in that same proportion. A doubling of both inputs, for example, will result in doubled output. Discuss how the concept of linear regression might be applied to estimate \beta and \gamma .

Options:

A: Polynomial regression
B: Linear progression
C: Quantile regression
D: Ridge regression
E: Logistic regression
F: Exponential regression
G: Lasso regression
H: Multiple regression
I: Single regression
J: Non-linear regression

Okay, so I've got this question about production functions and linear regression. Hmm, the question is about how to apply linear regression to estimate the parameters β and γ in the production function Q = AK^β L^γ. I remember that production functions usually have certain properties, like diminishing returns, and that β + γ equals 1 when it's a Cobb-Douglas function.

Wait, the question is about using linear regression to estimate β and γ. Normally, in linear regression, you model a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables with a straight line. But production functions are more complex because they involve exponents, not just linear terms.

I think the idea here is to transform the production function into a linear form so that we can apply linear regression techniques. Let me think about the production function: Q is equal to A times K to the power β times L to the power γ. If I take the natural logarithm of both sides, that should linearize the equation.

So taking ln(Q) = ln(A) + β ln(K) + γ ln(L). Now, this is a linear equation in terms of ln(Q), ln(K), and ln(L). So if I use linear regression, I can treat ln(Q) as the dependent variable and ln(K) and ln(L) as independent variables. The coefficients in this regression would be β and γ respectively.

Wait, but what about A? A is a scaling factor, so if I'm using ln(A) as part of the equation, then the intercept would be ln(A). So when I run the regression, the intercept would be ln(A), and the coefficients for ln(K) and ln(L) would be β and γ.

So the process involves taking the natural logs of Q, K, and L, then performing a linear regression where ln(Q) is the dependent variable and ln(K) and ln(L) are the independent variables. The resulting coefficients for ln(K) and ln(L) are β and γ. 

Looking at the options, what does that correspond to? The options are A through J, with E being exponential regression. Wait, no. The options are A: Polynomial, B: Linear progression, C: Quantile, D: Ridge, E: exponential, F: exponential reg, G: Lasso, H: multiple, I: single, J: non-linear.

Wait, I'm not sure. Wait, the question is about linear regression to estimate β and γ. So the process would involve taking logs, then running a linear regression. So the correct method is called linear regression, but in the transformed space. So the correct term for the model is that of linear regression on the log variables. But the question is about the approach: is it linear regression?

Wait, the question is about how linear regression might be applied. So the approach would be to perform a linear regression on the logged variables. So the options should reflect that. Let me look again at the options.

Option H is multiple regression. That's when more than one independent variable is used. So if the model is Q = AK^β L^γ, then we'd have two independent variables. So a multiple regression would fit that. 

Wait, the options are:

H: Multiple regression

I: Single regression

So if the model is Q = AK^β L^γ, it's a multiple regression with two independent variables, K and L. So the correct method is multiple regression, which is option H.

Wait, but the question asks how linear regression might be applied, not necessarily the correct term. Or does the question imply that linear regression is being used in the sense of linearizing the model? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about applying linear regression to estimate β and γ. So the production function is non-linear because of the exponents. So by taking logs, we can turn it into a linear model. So the process is linear regression on the logs. But the question is about the concept of linear regression being used for this, which would be called linear regression.

Wait, but looking at the options, the only ones that apply are H and I. H is multiple regression, I is single. So the model involves two variables, K and L, so multiple regression is the term, so H is correct.

Other options: J is non-linear, which would be the case for Q = AK^β L^γ. So the conclusion is that linear regression is used to estimate the parameters in the log-linear model, but the question is about the approach, not the model itself. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The correct method is linear regression on the log-transformed variables. The options don't have a term for that, but the question is about applying linear regression. The correct term for the model is linear regression, but the question is about the approach. So perhaps the options are trying to point towards the method of using linear regression on transformed data.

Wait, the options are about the method, not the model. So if you have a production function and you take logs, then run a linear regression, that's linear regression. So the correct choice would be H: Multiple regression? Or wait, if you're using two variables, it's multiple regression. So yes, the technique is called linear regression on the transformed data, but the answer options are about the method.

Alternatively, perhaps the question's options are more about the approach, and the correct method is linear regression, but when the variables are logged, it's linear. So the correct answer is H because it's a multiple regression, with two independent variables. But I'm a bit shaky on whether the term is 'linear regression' or 'log-linear regression'. 

Wait, the question says "discuss how the concept of linear regression might be applied to estimate β and γ." So applying linear regression in this context would involve taking the logs, then using linear regression. So the term is linear regression. Wait, but the options don't have a term for that. The options are about the method you use to estimate them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Multiple regression. Because the model includes two variables (K and L), so it's multiple regression. So the process is linear regression on the log variables, but the method is called multiple regression.

The production function Q = AK^βL^γ is non-linear due to the exponents β and γ. To apply linear regression to estimate β and γ, the equation must be linearized by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(Q) = ln(A) + β ln(K) + γ ln(L).

This linearized form allows the use of linear regression, where ln(Q) is the dependent variable, and ln(K) and ln(L) are the independent variables. The coefficients β and γ, which were originally exponents, now become the slopes of the regression lines.

Looking at the options, the correct method involves linear regression on the log-transformed variables. While the term "linear regression" refers to the process itself, the appropriate term for the model is "multiple regression," as it includes two independent variables (K and L). Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: Multiple regression.
