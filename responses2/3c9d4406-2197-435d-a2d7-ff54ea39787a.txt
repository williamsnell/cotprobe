Okay, so I have this question about Aristotle's concept of incontinence. Hmm, I remember from my studies that Aristotle had different categories of moral behavior. Let me think. Incontinence is one of them. 

Wait, the question is asking what incontinence refers to in Aristotle's terminology. So, in Aristotle, incontinence is when you act on your feelings without considering their appropriateness. That makes sense. Because he thought that emotions have to be controlled. So he said that incontinence is when you're not careful with your emotions and let them dictate your actions, even if they're wrong.

Looking at the options, option A says one knows that feelings are inappropriate but acts anyway. That sounds like incontinence. Option B is the opposite, knowing they're inappropriate but not acting. That's more of a defect than incontinence. Option C says you act despite their appropriateness. That's not incontinence; that's more of a response when emotions are misplaced.

Option D is about not knowing actions are wrong. That's the opposite of incontinence. If actions are wrong, you'd act on them, not do otherwise. So D is about not being wrong, which is the opposite, not the same as incontinence.

Option E is that you know actions are wrong but act anyway. That's more of a defect than incontinence because in E, you still act wrong, but in C, you don't, but don't know they're wrong. So E is about not understanding why they're wrong, while in C is about not considering their appropriateness, regardless of whether they're wrong.

Option F is about not acting despite knowing actions are right. That's the opposite of incontinence because in F, you ignore the rightness, which is the opposite of letting your feelings dictate your wrong actions.

Option G is about doing the right action but for the wrong reason. That's the opposite of incontinence; that's more of a behavior that's wrong but perhaps not the same as incontinence.

Option H is about not knowing actions are right. That's about not being aware of the truth, so it's a separate issue from incontinence.

Option I is about doing the right action without understanding why. So that's a different category. I think I'm between A and I in terms of incontinence and some other behavior.

Wait, in Aristotle, incontinence was specifically about when one's emotions dictate their actions without considering whether they're right. So it's when you know your emotions are inappropriate but act anyway. That's option A.

So looking at the options, A is the correct answer.

In Aristotle’s terminology, incontinence refers to the act of acting on inappropriate emotions without considering their appropriateness. This is best described by option A: one knows that one's feelings are inappropriate but acts on them anyway.

Answer: A
