Okay, so I have to figure out which of these options is the least informative outcome from an experiment. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Let me start by recalling what statistical significance means.统计显著性 means that the results are likely not due to chance, right? So when an experiment shows a statistically significant result, it suggests that the data supports a true effect, not random variation.

Now, the power of an experiment is the probability of detecting a true effect when it exists. High power means there's a high chance of detecting a true effect, while low power means there's a higher risk of missing it because the study is underpowered.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Statistical nonsignificance under low power. Nonsignificant results at low power mean that even though the study had enough power to detect the effect, the data doesn't support it. But since it's under low power, it's not very reliable. So even though there's no significant result, the study wasn't designed well to detect it. This is informative because knowing it's nonsignificant despite low power gives more context about the likely effect.

Option B: Statistical significance under low power. This would mean that the results are significant, but the study was underpowered. So, you might have a false positive because the effect was real but the study didn't have enough power to detect it. This is less reliable and perhaps not very informative because it's a false positive.

Option C: Statistical nonsignificance under high power. High power means the study is more likely to detect the effect. If the results are nonsignificant under high power, that suggests that the effect is small or that the study didn't find a significant effect. This is more informative because it gives a clearer picture of the likely magnitude of the effect.

Option D: Statistical significance under high power. High-powered studies are good at finding significant results when there's a true effect. So this is a clear and reliable outcome because the results are real and the study was well-designed.

So the question is asking which is least informative. Option B is under low power and shows significance. That's a problem because low power can lead to false positives. So even though you get a significant result, it's not reliable because the study wasn't powered well. It's less informative than the others because it's not a reliable outcome.

I think the answer is B: statistical significance under low power because it's less reliable than the others. It tells you the result is significant, but you don't know if it's true or a false positive because the study wasn't powered well.

The least informative outcome is **B: statistical significance under low power**, because low power can lead to false positives, making the result unreliable.

Answer: B
