Okay, I need to figure out how much a 6-lb bag of cat food costs when it's $0.47 per pound. Let me think step by step. So, the price per pound is $0.47, and I'm buying 6 pounds. I should multiply these two numbers together.

Hmm, so 6 multiplied by 0.47. Let me write that down: 6 * 0.47. I'm a bit rusty on my multiplication, but let's see. 6 times 0.4 is 2.4, and 6 times 0.07 is 0.42. Adding those together, 2.4 + 0.42 equals 2.82. So, the total cost should be $2.82.

Looking at the options, option E is $2.82. That must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to double-check, 6 pounds at 47 cents each. 6*40 is 240, and 6*7 is 42. So 240+42=282 cents, which is $2.82. Yep, that matches.
