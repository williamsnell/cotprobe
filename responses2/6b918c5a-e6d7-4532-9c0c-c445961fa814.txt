Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many baseball balls are in a walk. Hmm, I remember that a walk is when a player reaches first base safely, so they get a hit. But how many balls does that involve? Let me think about the game.

In baseball, each batter gets a chance to bat, and there are usually 9 innings in a game. When a batter reaches base, they get a "walk." But wait, how many balls does that take? A walk is when the runner reaches first base without being caught. It's not about the number of balls the pitcher throws, but rather the number of balls the batter hits.

I think a walk can involve up to two balls, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, a walk typically involves a single or two balls, depending on the situation. But in this context, the question is asking how many balls make a walk. So, each walk is completed when a runner gets to first, and that's one instance of a walk.

Wait, but the question is about the number of balls in a walk, not the number of walks. So, each walk involves one batter striking out with a single, which means the pitcher throws one ball to the runner. But wait, that's not it. Or is it? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of balls in a walk in terms of the game. Each game has 9 innings, and each inning has three walks. So, 9 innings times 3 walks per inning equals 27 walks in a game. But the question is about the number of balls, not walks. So that's not it.

Wait, no, the question is about the number of balls that make a walk. So, each walk is a single instance, right? So, each walk is one ball. Therefore, how many balls make a walk? It's one ball each time a runner gets to first. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit different. I remember that a walk can be either a single, double, or triple, but in terms of balls, each walk is a single ball. So, each walk is one ball. So, the number of balls in a walk is one. But the options include E: one, which might be correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Each walk is a single instance where a runner gets to first on a single hit. So, that's one ball. So, the answer would be E: one.

The correct answer is E: one. Each walk in baseball is completed when a runner reaches first base on a single hit, which involves one ball. 

Answer: E
