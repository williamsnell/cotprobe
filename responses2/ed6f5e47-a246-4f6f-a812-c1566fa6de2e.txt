Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the ratio of the specific heats of air. They told me that air is treated as an ideal gas for approximation, which is a good start. I remember that specific heats are related to how much heat is needed to change the temperature of a gas. The ratio of specific heats is often denoted as γ (gamma) or sometimes Cp/Cv. Wait, but wait—sometimes it's the other way around. Oh right, I think γ is Cp divided by Cv. So γ = Cp/Cv.

The given data is that at sea level and STP, the velocity of sound (a) is 334 m/s, and the molecular weight (M) of air is 28.8 g/mol. Oh, right, I think the molecular weight is in grams per mole, which is a common unit in these problems.

So, I remember there's a formula that relates the velocity of sound in an ideal gas to its specific heats and other properties. The formula is a² = γ R T. Wait, is that right? Or was it a² = (γ R T) / M? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Oh wait, no, another formula comes to mind. The speed of sound in a gas is given by a = sqrt(γ R T / M), where R is the specific gas constant, M is the molar mass, and T is the temperature. But wait, sometimes R is used as the universal gas constant, so I need to be careful about units.

Wait, another approach. The velocity of sound (a) is related to the specific heats and the temperature. The formula I think is a² = γ R T. But I'm not sure about the units. Alternatively, maybe a² is equal to (γ R T) divided by the molar mass? Because I remember that the specific gas constant R is R = R0 / M, where R0 is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K) and M is molar mass in kg/mol.

So putting units together, a² = (γ R T) / M. Or wait, perhaps a different approach. Let's think about the adiabatic relations. The speed of sound is given by a = sqrt(γ P / rho), where P is pressure and rho is density. But I'm not sure if that's the most helpful here.

Alternatively, another formula I recall is that a² = (γ R T) / M, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression. Maybe I should look up the formula again, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I remember.

So given that a² = γ R T / M, but wait, wait—no, I think the correct formula is a² = (γ R T) / M. But R is the specific gas constant. Wait, no. R is actually the universal gas constant divided by the molar mass. So R_specific = R / M. Therefore, a² = γ (R_specific) T. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of units.

Wait, let's get back to the problem. They give me a, the velocity of sound, which is 334 m/s. Temperature, since it's STP, is 273 K. So I can plug these into a² = γ R T / M. Wait, but wait: the R I'm using is the specific gas constant, right? Because R (universal) is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but for specific gas constant, R_specific = R / M. So M is 28.8 g/mol. Wait, let's convert that to kg/mol. 28.8 g/mol is 0.0288 kg/mol.

So R_specific = 8.314 J/(mol·K) / 0.0288 kg/mol = approximately 289.4 J/(kg·K). Wait, wait, let me compute that. 8.314 / 0.0288 is about 289.4 J/(kg·K).

Wait, but maybe I should compute R_specific correctly. Let me do the calculation: 8.314 / 0.0288.

Hmm, 8.314 divided by 0.0288. Let's compute this. 0.0288 is approximately 2.88e-2.

8.314 / 0.0288 = 8.314 * (1/0.0288) = 8.314 * 34.7222 ≈ let's see, 8 *34.7 is about 277.6, and 0.314*34.7 is about 10.9. So total around 288.5. So approximately 288.5 J/(kg·K).

So now, using a² = γ * R_specific * T.

Wait, but wait, another formula I remember: the speed of sound in air is also given by a = sqrt( (gamma) * (P) / (rho) ), but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, the formula I've come across is a = sqrt( (gamma * R_specific * T) ). So let's use that.

So, a² = gamma * R_specific * T.

Given a is 334 m/s, a² is (334)^2 = 334 *334. Let's compute that. 300^2=90000, 34^2=1156, and cross terms 2*300*34=20400. So 300+34=334. (300+34)^2=300^2 + 2*300*34 + 34^2=90000 + 20400 + 1156 = 90000 +20400=110400 +1156=111556. So a² is 111556 m²/s².

So, 111556 = gamma * R_specific * T.

We have T=273 K, R_specific=288.5 J/(kg·K).

So, 111556 = gamma * 288.5 * 273.

Let me compute 288.5 * 273.

Compute 288 * 273: 288 * 200 = 57600, 288*70=20160, 288*3=864. So 57600 +20160=77760 +864=78624. Then 0.5 *273=136.5. So 78624 + 136.5 =78760.5.

So 288.5 *273 =78760.5.

So, now, 111556 = gamma * 78760.5.

Solving for gamma, gamma = 111556 / 78760.5.

Let me compute this division.

111556 ÷ 78760.5.

Hmm, let's approximate. 78760.5 *1.4 is about 78760.5 *1.4= let's see, 78760*1=78760, 0.4*78760=31504 → total 1,09264.

Which is less than 1,11556.

What's 78760.5 *1.48?

1.48 =1.4 +0.08.

1.4 *78760.5= 1,09264.7.

0.08 *78760.5= approx 6,300.84.

So total 1,09264.7 +6300.84= 115,565.54.

Wait, but 111556 is between 1.4*78760.5 and 1.48? Wait, 1.48 gives 115,565.54 which is higher than 111,556.

Wait, wait, 1.48 is 148%, so 1.48 *78760.5 = 115,565.54, which is more than our numerator (111,556).

Hmm, so let's try 1.45.

1.45 *78760.5 = 78760.5 *1 =78760.5, 0.45 *78760.5=78760.5 *0.4=31,504.2, 78760.5*0.05=3,938.025 → sum is 31,504.2 +3,938.025=35,442.225. So total is 78,760.5 +35,442.225=114,202.725.

So 1.45 gives about 114,202.7, which is higher than 111,556.

Hmm, so perhaps 1.42?

1.42 *78760.5 → let's compute 1 *78760.5=78760.5, 0.42*78760.5.

0.42 *78760.5 = (0.4 *78760.5) + (0.02 *78760.5) = 31,504.2 + 1,575.21 = 33,079.41.

So 78760.5 +33,079.41=111,839.91.

Wait, our a² is 111,556, which is a bit less than 111,839.91. So 1.42 gives 111,839.91, which is higher than 111,556.

So the gamma is between 1.42 and 1.45. Let's see how much.

Let's compute the difference.

At gamma=1.42, a²=111,839.91 (which is 111,839.91-111,556= 283.91 higher than desired value).

At gamma=1.45, the value is 114,202.725. We need 111,556.

So the difference between 1.42 and 1.45: the a² value increases by 114,202.725 - 111,839.91 = 2,362.815 over 0.03 change in gamma.

We need to find the gamma where a² is 111,556. The desired a² is 111,556, which is 111,839.91 - 111,556=283.91 below the value at gamma=1.42.

So how much of the 2,362.815 increase does 283.91 represent? (283.91 / 2362.815) ≈ 0.1195 of the 0.03 change.

So, delta gamma = 0.03 * 0.1195 ≈ 0.003585.

So gamma ≈ 1.42 + 0.003585 ≈ 1.4236.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculation.

Another approach: using linear approximation.

We have two points:

gamma1 = 1.42 → a²=111,839.91

gamma2 =1.45 → a²=114,202.725

We want a²=111,556 → delta =111,556 -111,839.91= -283.91.

The total change from gamma1 to gamma2 is 2,362.815.

So fraction = -283.91 / 2362.815 ≈ -0.1195.

So gamma is gamma1 + (gamma2 - gamma1) * fraction.

=1.42 + 0.03 * (-0.1195) ≈ 1.42 - 0.003585 ≈ 1.4164.

So gamma ≈1.4164.

Looking at the options, option G is approximately 1.415, which is close to 1.4164. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but let me think again about the formula I used. Did I get the right formula?

Another way to compute the speed of sound is a = sqrt( (gamma * R_specific * T) ). So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: sometimes gamma is taken as 1.4 for air, but according to the calculation, it's about 1.4164, which is approximately 1.415 (option G), but wait, option D is 1.38, etc.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, another formula from the ideal gas: the speed of sound is a² = (gamma * R_specific * T) → yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another version I've heard is a² = (gamma * P) / (rho), but I don't remember the exact. Perhaps the derivation is correct.

Alternatively, another formula for the speed of sound is a = sqrt( (gamma * R * T) / M ), but wait, R is the universal gas constant, and M is the molar mass.

Wait, in the earlier approach, I used R_specific (R/M). So let me re-express that.

Yes, because R_specific = R / M. So, a² = gamma * R_specific * T.

So that's correct.

So according to the calculation, the ratio gamma is approximately 1.4164, which is closest to option G (1.415) or perhaps another option?

Looking at the options: G is 1.415, which is very close to 1.4164. The next higher option is E:1.67, which is way off. So the correct answer should be G.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, let's compute 111556 divided by 78760.5.

Hmm, let me compute 78760.5 * 1.415.

78760.5 * 1 =78760.5

0.415 = 0.4 +0.015.

0.4 *78760.5 = 31,504.2

0.015 *78760.5 = 1,181.4075

So sum is 78760.5 +31,504.2= 109,264.7 +1,181.4075=110,446.1075.

Wait, but our numerator is 111,556. So 1.415 gives a²=110,446.1 (approx) which is less than 111,556.

Hmm, so 1.415 gives 110,446.1, which is 1,110 less than 111,556. So how much more in gamma do we need?

So the remaining is 111,556 -110,446.1=1,109.9.

How much gamma beyond 1.415 would give us 1,109.9 more?

Each additional 0.001 in gamma would increase a² by 78760.5 *0.001 =78.7605.

So 1,109.9 /78.7605 ≈ 14.14.

So approximately 14.14 *0.001=0.01414.

So gamma is approx 1.415 +0.01414= 1.42914.

Wait, but that can't be right because 1.429 would be way over, but in reality, I think the calculation is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me compute gamma as a²/(R_specific*T).

a² is 111556. R_specific is 288.5, and T is 273.

So gamma = 111556 / (288.5 *273).

Compute 288.5 *273 =78,760.5.

So 111556 /78760.5 = let's compute this division.

Compute 78760.5 * 1.415 = ?

Wait, 78760 *1.415 = ?

Well, 78760 *1 =78760.

78760 *0.4 =31,504.

78760 *0.01=787.6.

78760 *0.005=393.8.

So adding these up:

78760 +31,504 =110,264.

110,264 +787.6 =111,051.6.

111,051.6 +393.8=111,445.4.

So 78760.5 *1.415 =111,445.4. But our numerator is 111,556, which is 111,556-111,445.4=110.6 higher.

So extra 110.6/(78760.5) → 110.6/78760.5≈0.00141.

So total gamma=1.415 +0.00141=1.4164.

Which matches my earlier calculation.

So the ratio gamma is approximately 1.4164, which is option G (1.415) is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a different formula. Let me think about the speed of sound in air using the relation a^2 = (gamma * P) / rho, but I don't have the pressure or density.

Wait, but another formula I remember: a = sqrt( (gamma * R * T) / M ). Wait, but M is the molar mass. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the equation a² = (gamma * R * T) / M, which is the same as what I did.

So the only possible conclusion is that the correct ratio is approximately 1.416, which is closest to option G (1.415).

So the answer should be G.

Another way to think about this: I recall that the speed of sound in air depends on temperature and the ratio gamma. Since gamma is 1.4, which is a known value for air, but the calculated ratio came out to be a little higher.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another formula for the speed of sound is a = sqrt( (gamma * R_specific * T) ), which is the same as what I used.

So the calculation seems correct.

Thus, the correct answer is G) 1.415.
</think>

To calculate the ratio of specific heats (γ) for air, we use the formula for the speed of sound in air:

\[
a^2 = \gamma \cdot R_{\text{specific}} \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( a = 334 \, \text{m/s} \) (velocity of sound),
- \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \) (temperature),
- \( R_{\text{specific}} = \frac{R}{M} \), where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) is the universal gas constant and \( M = 0.0288 \, \text{kg/mol} \) is the molar mass of air.

### Step 1: Calculate \( R_{\text{specific}} \)
\[
R_{\text{specific}} = \frac{8.314}{0.0288} \approx 288.5 \, \text{J/(kg·K)}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute into the formula for \( a^2 \)
\[
a^2 = 334^2 = 111556 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]
\[
111556 = \gamma \cdot 288.5 \cdot 273
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the denominator
\[
288.5 \cdot 273 = 78760.5
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \gamma \)
\[
\gamma = \frac{111556}{78760.5} \approx 1.4164
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest value to \( 1.4164 \) is **1.415** (option G).

### Final Answer:
ANSWER: G
