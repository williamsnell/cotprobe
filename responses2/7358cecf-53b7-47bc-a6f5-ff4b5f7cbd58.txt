Question:

A 33-year-old man undergoes a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. During the operation, moderate hemorrhaging requires ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, serum studies show a calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin concentration of 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 200 pg/mL. Damage to which of the following vessels caused the findings in this patient?

Options:

A: Branch of the costocervical trunk
B: Branch of the external carotid artery
C: Branch of the thyrocervical trunk
D: Tributary of the internal jugular vein

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about thyroidectomy and the parathyroid hormone levels. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says a 33-year-old man had a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. During the operation, there was moderate hemorrhaging, so they had to ligate several vessels on the left side of the neck. After the surgery, his serum studies show a calcium of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone 200 pg/mL.

Wait, I remember that when the thyroid gland is damaged, it can cause a hyperparathyroidism because the parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels go up. Parathyroid Hormone levels are usually around 100-200 pg/mL. So, here it's 200, which is on the higher end. That suggests a hyperparathyroidism, meaning the bones areé’™ifying too much.

But wait, the patient had moderate hemorrhage during the thyroidectomy. I'm trying to remember what causes hemorrhage in thyroid surgery. I think it's usually related to a secondary hypothyroidism. Secondary hypothyroidism can lead to hemorrhaging because it leads to a deficiency of thyroid hormone, which can cause edema, or fluid buildup, leading to blood loss. So, in this case, the hyperparathyroidism would affect calcium levels, not directly the thyroid function.

So the patient's parathyroid hormone levels are high, which indicates hyperparathyroidism. That's because the person had a thyroidectomy, and the hypothyroidism was secondary. The hyperparathyroidism would cause the parathyroid hormone levels to be elevated.

Now, looking at the options, which vessel damage caused this?

The options are A to D, all different branches of the neck and the thyroid.

Option C is the thyrocervical trunk. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Thyrocervical trunk is the part of the neck that goes from the thyroid to the bladder. The main branch of the thyroid is the thyrocervical trunk, which is the common branch.

Ligation of vessels on the left side of the neck would affect the left side of the common branch. So if the common branch (thyrocervical trunk) is ligated, that would affect the parathyroid hormone levels.

Wait, but why? Because the common branch carries calcium to the bladder. If that branch is ligated, the calcium can't flow through, so the parathyroid hormone levels would increase because the body can't get enough calcium. So that would lead to a hyperparathyroidism.

So the damage is to the common branch of the thyrocervical trunk. Looking back, option C is the branch of the thyrocervical trunk. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another thought: the thymus is involved in hormone production, but the main issue here is the parathyroid. So the common branch's damage would cause hyperparathyroidism.

So options: A is costocervical, which is the common branch. B is external carotid, which is the left side of the common branch? Or is it the right? Alternatively, the external carotid is the left, and the common branch is the right.

Wait, the common branch is the left side of the thymus, which is the left side of the neck (costocervical trunk). So option A is the common branch of the costocervical trunk. Option C is the thyrocervical trunk, which is the thymus.

Wait, the question says the vessels ligated are on the left side of the neck, so the thymus (thyrocervical trunk) is on the left side. So the damage is to the common branch of the thyrocervical trunk, which is option C.

So the correct answer is C.

The patient underwent a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer and experienced moderate hemorrhaging, necessitating the ligation of vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, his serum studies revealed elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels of 200 pg/mL, indicating hyperparathyroidism. This hyperparathyroidism arises from secondary hypothyroidism, which causes edema and hemorrhaging. The primary cause of the PTH increase is the damage to the common branch of the thyrocervical trunk (Option C), as this branch is responsible for distributing calcium to the bladder. Ligation of vessels in this branch would disrupt calcium transport, leading to increased parathyroid hormone levels.

ANSWER: C
