Okay, so I have this question about anaerobic organisms, specifically comparing facultative anaerobes and obligatory anaerobes. I'm a bit rusty on my microbiology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that anaerobic organisms are those that don't require oxygen for survival. There are different types based on whether they can thrive in environments with or without oxygen. 

The question is asking how a facultative anaerobe differs from an oblgatory anaerobe. So, I need to figure out what characteristics make each one different.

I think the key terms here are "facultative" and "obligatory" types. facultative means they can live in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions, but not always. Obglatory, on the other hand, means they can only live when there's enough oxygen. If there's no oxygen, they die.

So, looking at the options, option A says facultative anaerobes can survive in oxygen-rich environments by entering a dormant state. That sounds right because I remember that in such conditions, they might not need to produce much ATP or other energy, so they can store more nutrients or stay dormant.

Option B says they can live either in presence or absence of oxygen. That also seems correct because that's what I recall about facultative anaerobes. They can adjust their metabolic state depending on conditions.

Option C is the opposite. It says they can only live in presence of oxygen, which would make them obligatory. So C is incorrect.

Option D: die in presence of oxygen. No, that's not right. Because in缺氧 conditions, they can't survive. So D is wrong.

Option E: Obligatory anaerobes can tolerate low oxygen for short periods. Hmm, this might be mixing things up. Obligatory usually means they can't survive without oxygen, but they don't have to live in low oxygen. Wait, wait. Oh, no, wait. Wait, I think I might have gotten this wrong. Obglatory anaerobes can live even in low oxygen because they have an autotrophic lifestyle. So, perhaps E is incorrect. Or maybe I'm confusing terms.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Obglatory anaerobes can live in low oxygen because they use carbon fixation and respiration, but they can do that because they break down organic matter themselves. So they don't require much oxygen. So E is talking about obligatory, which are the ones that die when oxygen is low. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: Obligatory anaerobes can live either in presence or absence of oxygen. That doesn't make sense because obligatory anaerobes die when oxygen is low. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Obligatory anaerobes use oxygen for respiration when it's available. Wait, that's not right. Because if they can live in low oxygen, they don't need to use oxygen for respiration. So G is wrong.

Option H: Facultative anaerobes cannot live without oxygen. That's the opposite of what I remember. Facultives can live without oxygen because they may be autotrophic and use other resources. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Facultative anaerobes can live without oxygen but prefer low oxygen. That makes sense. Because in low oxygen, they can use other forms of energy or nutrients, like breaking down organic matter. So I is correct.

Wait, going back to the question, it's asking how they differ. So both A and I are correct? Wait, no. Wait, the question is about a comparison between a facultative anaerobes and an obglatory anaerobes. Oh, no, wait, the options are about characteristics of each, not the comparison.

Wait, no, wait, the question is about the difference between a facultative anaerobes and an obglatory anaerobes. So the options are giving different characteristics of each.

So, the question is: which option describes the difference between the two types.

So, let's see. The options are A to H.

Looking back: 

Option A says, "Facultative anaerobes can survive in oxygen-rich environments by entering a dormant state." That's correct for facultative anaerobes because they can store resources in the dark, perhaps.

Option I is "Facultative anaerobes can live without oxygen but prefer low oxygen levels." That's also correct because they can survive without oxygen but thrive in low oxygen conditions.

Wait, but the question is asking how a facultative anaerobes differ from an obglatory anaerobes. So perhaps the options are not comparing them but are giving statements about each. The question is about how they differ, so perhaps the correct answer is either A or I. Wait, but the options are the possible choices for the answer.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the difference between a facultative anaerobes and an obglatory anaerobes. So the options are statements about either one. So the correct answer is one of the options that differs between the two. So the options A-F are talking about characteristics of one, and G-H are characteristics of the other.

Wait, the question is: How does a facultative anaerobes differ from an obglatory anaerobes?

So each option is a statement about one type. The answer would be which statement is correct for one type.

Wait, the options are each about a particular type, so the correct answer is either A, B, etc. But the question is which option describes the difference between the two types. Hmm, perhaps the question is structured such that it's a multiple-choice where each option is a feature of either one.

Wait no, perhaps the question is phrased as: "How does a facultative anaerobes differ from an obglatory anaerobes?" So the correct answer is a statement that's correct for one type and incorrect for the other, or which of the options is correct for either.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me rephrase. The question is about the characteristics of a facultative anaerobes and how they differ from an obglatory one. But it's presented as options, each of which is a characteristic of one type.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct approach is to compare their behaviors. So the correct answer is which option describes the difference between the two. For example, option A is a correct statement about a facultative anaerobes, so the answer would be A if that's the only correct statement.

Alternatively, maybe the question is which option is correct for the difference. Wait, the options are A-F and G-H, which are possible for either. Wait, no, the options are each about a type.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is: How does a facultative anaerobe differ from anobligatory anaerobes?

So, the question is a general question about the difference between the two types. The options given are statements that describe either type.

So, the correct answer is a statement that is correct for either type, or perhaps which of the options correctly explains the difference.

Wait, no. The options are each a possible statement about either a type. So the correct answer is which statement is correct for one of the types.

Wait, perhaps the question is not comparing the two, but which option correctly describes a difference. So which option is correct for either or both.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and I, but looking at the options, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, let's think again. The question is asking which option correctly describes the difference between a facultative anaerobes and anobligatory anaerobes.

So, which of the options correctly describes one of them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: FAC. can survive in oxygen-rich environments by entering a dormant state.

This is correct for a facultative anaerobes.

Option I: FAC. can live without oxygen but prefer low oxygen.

This is also correct for a FAC.

Options B and C: FAC. can live either presence or absence. Correct.

But the question is about how they differ. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, since that's how FAC. differs from obglatory.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between the two types. So the correct answer would be the option that describes one of them. For example, option A is correct for FAC. but not for obglatory.

Wait, but the question is asking how a FAC differs from an OB. So the correct answer is the statement that's correct for FAC and incorrect for OB, or vice versa.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list the characteristics of each.

Facultative anaerobes:

- Can live in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions.

- Can store nutrients (like CO2) in the dark.

- Resist oxygen stress by breaking down organic matter.

- Often use autotrophic strategies.

- Do not have to prioritize oxygen, so they can live without it.

Option I is correct for FAC.

Option A is also correct for FAC.

Obglatory anaerobes:

- Must live in environments with sufficient oxygen.

- Often use carbon fixation and respiration, breaking down organic matter themselves.

- Don't need to store nutrients, so can't survive without oxygen.

So, option I is not correct for obglatory because they can live without oxygen.

So, the correct answer would be option A and I, but since each option is about one type, I think the correct answer is A and I. But looking at the options, perhaps the question is asking which statement is correct for either type.

Wait, no. I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what the question is asking. It's a multiple-choice question where the user is to select the correct option that describes the difference between a FAC and an OB. So, the correct answer is one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: FAC can survive in oxygen-rich by entering dormant state. Correct.

Option I: FAC can live without oxygen but prefer low. Correct.

So, both A and I are correct statements. But in the options, perhaps only one is an option, but the question is about a difference between the two. So the correct answer is either A or I.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as "How does a FAC differ from an OB," so which option is correct for either. So, both A and I are correct, but perhaps they're not both correct in the same way.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's a true statement about FAC. Option I is another true statement about FAC.

Wait, but the multiple-choice options only allow one correct answer. So, perhaps the question is about which statement is correct for one of the types, and the options are either true or not.

Wait, perhaps the question is where the options are each about a type, and the correct answer is a statement that's correct for one of the types.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's a correct statement about FAC.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to look for a different approach.

The options are:

A: FAC can survive oxygen-rich by entering dormant.

B: FAC can live either in presence or absence.

C: FAC can only in presence.

D: FAC die in presence.

E: OB can live in low oxygen for short periods.

F: OB can live in presence or absence.

G: OB use oxygen when available.

H: FAC can't live without O2.

I: FAC can live without O2 but prefer low.

So the question is how a FAC differs from an OB.

So, the correct answer should be a statement that is true for one type and false for the other.

So, option I: FAC can live without O2 but prefer low. That's correct for FAC.

Option A: FAC can survive in O-rich by entering a dormant state. That's correct for FAC.

So both A and I are correct for FAC, but the question is about the difference between a FAC and an OB.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's about FAC's behavior, while option I is about another FAC. But the question is about the difference between a FAC and an OB.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A because that's a correct statement about FAC.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I because it's a correct statement about FAC.

Wait, but the question is about the difference between a FAC and an OB. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A because that's a correct statement about a FAC, and perhaps the other option is about an OB.

Wait, no. The options are each about a type. So for the question, which is comparing a FAC and an OB, perhaps the correct answer is option A and I, but the options don't offer both. So the correct answer must be either A or I.

Wait, but the question is phrased as a "how does a..." So the answer is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it correctly describes a FAC. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I because it's a correct statement about a FAC.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is either A or I. But the question allows us to choose one option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and I, but since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is A, as it's a true statement for a FAC. But the question is about a difference between a FAC and an OB, so perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I because it's a correct statement about a FAC.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A because it's a correct statement about a FAC. So the correct answer is option A.

The question asks how a facultative anaerobe differs from an obligatory anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes can thrive in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environments, while obligatory anaerobes require sufficient oxygen to survive. 

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: "Facultative anaerobes can survive in oxygen-rich environments by entering a dormant state." This is correct for a facultative anaerobes, as they often store resources in the dark or enter a non-energized state to survive in high oxygen conditions.
- **B**: "Facultative anaerobes can live either in the presence or absence of oxygen." This is also correct, as a key characteristic of facultative anaerobes is their ability to adapt to both conditions.
- **C**: "Facultative anaerobes can only live in the presence of oxygen." This is incorrect, as it contradicts the definition of a facultative anaerobes.
- **D**: "Facultative anaerobes die in the presence of oxygen." This is incorrect, as facultative anaerobes typically survive even in oxygen-rich conditions.
- **E**: "Obligatory anaerobes can live either in the presence or absence of oxygen." This is incorrect because obligatory anaerobes require sufficient oxygen to survive, so they cannot live in low oxygen conditions.
- **F**: "Obligatory anaerobes can live either in the presence or absence of oxygen." This is also incorrect for the same reason as option E.
- **G**: "Obligatory anaerobes use oxygen for respiration when it is available." This is incorrect because obligatory anaerobes cannot survive without oxygen.
- **H**: "Facultative anaerobes cannot live without oxygen." This is incorrect because facultative anaerobes can thrive in low oxygen conditions by using alternative energy sources.
- **I**: "Facultative anaerobes can live without oxygen but prefer environments with low oxygen levels." This is correct for a facultative anaerobes, as they prefer low oxygen to conserve energy and survive in缺氧 conditions.

### Conclusion:
Options **A** and **I** are both true statements about facultative anaerobes, but the question is asking for how a facultative anaerobes differs from an obligatory anaerobes. Since both A and I describe correct features of a facultative anaerobes, but the question focuses on their differences, the most accurate answer is **A**, as it highlights a specific characteristic of facultative anaerobes that sets them apart from obligatory ones.
