Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Mayan culture. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking which option is NOT part of the central elements of Mayan culture as of 1900 B.P. The options are from A to J, each describing different aspects.

First, I need to remember what I know about the Mayan civilization. The Mayans were a pre-Columbian culture, known for their advanced society. They were highly organized, with a calendar system, economic systems, and cultural traditions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A hieroglyphic written language and calendar. I know the Mayans had a complex calendar system, including a long count and a yucatán calendar. They also had a writing system, but I think it's not just a simple hieroglyphic like the Egyptians. I'm a bit fuzzy on whether they had a fully written language. Wait, no, the Mayan wrote with a system that was more like their own, not a fully developed script like hieroglyphs. So maybe A is not correct.

Option B: Stratified societies ruled by kings. The Mayan were part of a complex society with a hierarchy. They had a central government, but also had regional governments. Hierarchical structures were common in their society, so B seems correct.

Option C: A sophisticated bronze industry. The Mayans did have advanced bronze production, especially in the Iznza culture, which was around 1900 B.C. So C is correct.

Option D: Construction of large-scale pyramids. Definitely, the Mayans built massive structures like the Great Pyramid, so D is correct.

Option E: Usage of gold currency. They did use gold, but it wasn't their primary currency. Their currency was the Quetzal, which was a mix of coins and a bullion. So E is correct.

Option F: System of slavery. The Mayans were against slavery, so F is not correct. They had their own labor system, and slavery wasn't part of their culture.

Option G: Ritual ball games and a reverence for precious jade. The Mayans were known for their art, including ritual ball games and their use of jade for jewelry and possibly spiritual reasons. So G is correct.

Option H: An established system of agriculture. The Mayans were known for their fertile land and the development of agriculture, so H is correct.

Option I: Advanced maritime trade routes. They did trade extensively, so I is correct.

Option J: Practice of human sacrifice. The Mayans had a complex religion with a significant proportion of people dying in wars, which was part of their rituals. So J is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which option did NOT include. Let's recheck.

Option A: Mayan had a calendar but only a written one (maybe not fully hieroglyphic), not a written language. Hieroglyphic was more like the Egyptians. So A is correct in that they didn't have a written language, but the question is about the central elements. Central elements would include the calendar, but what about the written language? Maybe they had a more advanced system, but I think their writing was more like their own, not fully hieroglyphic. So A is correct in that they didn't have a written language.

Wait, but the question is about what was NOT part of the central elements. The central elements are their complex society, economic systems, and cultural practices, including their calendar, the yucatán, and their advanced agriculture. So which of the options is not part of this?

Looking again:

The question is, which option is NOT part of the central elements.

The options are:

A: a hierarchy with calendar (Yes, they had a calendar and a complex society)

B: stratified societies (Yes, they were structured)

C: bronze industry (Yes)

D: pyramids (Yes)

E: gold currency (Yes, they used it)

F: slavery (No, they were against it)

G: jade and ball games (Yes)

H: agriculture (Yes)

I: maritime trade (Yes)

J: sacrifice (Yes)

So the option that is not part of the central elements is F) System of slavery.

Wait, but option F is part of the Mayan's system, so the question is about what was NOT included. Therefore, F is the correct answer.
