Okay, so I have this calculus problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the volume of a solid whose base is the region bounded by x² = 4y and the line y=2. Each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. The options are A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, alright. I remember that when dealing with volumes of solids with known cross-sections, the method of slicing or the method of integration is usually the way to go. Since each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square, that probably means that the cross-sectional area is a square whose side depends on y.

First, I need to visualize the region. The base is between the parabola x²=4y and the line y=2. So, let me sketch this out mentally. The parabola x²=4y opens upward, with vertex at the origin. The line y=2 is a horizontal line that intersects the parabola at some points. To find those intersection points, I can substitute y=2 into the equation of the parabola.

So, x² = 4*2 = 8. Thus, x = sqrt(8) and x = -sqrt(8), which simplifies to x=2√2 and x=-2√2. So the region is a sort of "parabolic segment" from (2√2, 2) to (-2√2, 2), bounded by the line y=2 and the parabola.

Now, each cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. That means for each y-value between y=0 (since the parabola starts at y=0) and y=2, the cross-section is a square whose side length is determined by the width of the region at that y.

Wait, but the base is between the parabola and the line y=2. So, the horizontal distance from the parabola to the line is the width at each y. Since the cross-section is a square, the side length is this width. So, basically, the area of each cross-section is (width)^2.

Let me think. The width is the distance between x=2√2 and x=-2√2 at y=2, but actually, for a given y, the parabola is x=±2√(y). So, the width of the region at each y is from x=2√y to x=-2√y, which is 4√y. So, the width is 4√y. But wait, no. Wait, the region is bounded by the parabola and y=2. So, for each y, the horizontal line at y slices through the region; the horizontal width is from x=-2√y to x=2√y, which is 4√y. That's the width of the region at each y.

But since each cross-section is a square, the side of the square is this width, so the side length is 4√y. Therefore, the area of the square is (4√y)^2 = 16y.

Wait, that makes sense. So, to find the volume, I need to integrate the area from y=0 to y=2. So, Volume = ∫ from y=0 to y=2 of (4√y)^2 dy.

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, (4√y)^2 is 16y. So the integral becomes ∫16y dy from 0 to 2.

The integral of y dy is (1/2)y². So, 16 times that evaluated from 0 to 2 is 16*( (1/2)(2²) - 0 ) = 16*( (1/2)*4 ) = 16*2 = 32.

Wait, but let me double-check if I set up the integral correctly. Because sometimes, when the cross-section is perpendicular to the y-axis, the slices might be in terms of x, but in this case, since it's perpendicular to the y-axis, the slices are vertical, so the width at each y is indeed 4√y, so the area is (4√y)^2 = 16y. So integrating that from 0 to 2 gives 32, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the cross-section. Another way: the cross-section is a square, so the side is the distance between the two curves at each y. But wait, no. The region is bounded by the parabola and the line. So, at each y, the horizontal points on the parabola are x=±2√y, so the width is 4√y. Thus, the side length is 4√y, so the area is (4√y)^2 = 16y. Therefore, integrating 16y dy from y=0 to 2.

Yes, that seems correct. So the volume is 32, which is option B.
</think>

The volume of the solid is found by integrating the area of the square cross-sections perpendicular to the y-axis. At each y, the width of the region is 4√y, so the side length is 4√y, and the area is (4√y)² = 16y. Integrating this from y=0 to y=2 gives:

V = ∫₀² 16y dy = 16 * (1/2 y²) from 0 to 2 = 16 * (2) = 32.

Answer: B
