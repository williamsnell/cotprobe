Question:

How do scientists know that the majority of meteorites come from the asteroid belt?

Options:

A: The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
B: The chemical composition of meteorites is identical to the composition of asteroids from the asteroid belt.
C: The size and shape of meteorites match the size and shape of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
D: The trajectory of meteorites points back to the asteroid belt.
E: The asteroid belt is the only possible source of meteorites therefore they must originate there.
F: The density of meteorites is the same as the density of asteroids in the asteroid belt.
G: Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.
H: Scientists have found inscriptions on meteorites that indicate they originated from the asteroid belt.
I: Scientists have observed meteorites being ejected from the asteroid belt.

Okay, so I've got this question about meteorites and the asteroid belt. Hmm, I remember that meteorites are rocks found on the surfaces of asteroids. The question is asking why scientists think that the majority of meteorites come from the asteroid belt. Let me think about what each option says.

Option A: The spectra of some meteorites match asteroids in the asteroid belt. Spectra are like the unique signatures of elements and chemicals present. So if some meteorites have the same spectra, maybe that suggests they're from the same sources. But wait, isn't the asteroid belt itself made up of asteroids, so the spectra would be from those asteroids? Maybe if meteorites have the same spectra, they're coming from different sources. Or perhaps the question is suggesting that the asteroid belt itself has a unique spectrum.

Option B: The chemical composition is identical. Well, that's probably too strong. All meteorites might have some common elements, but the asteroid belt itself has a variety of chemicals. So if the meteorites have the same composition, that could indicate they're from the same source. But I'm not sure if that's a standard approach. I think it's more about the spectra, not the exact chemical makeup.

Option C: Size and shape match. That's another way to find the source. If meteorites that are big and shape like asteroids in the belt are from there. But I think that's not as reliable as looking at spectra or composition because size can vary a lot.

Option D: Trajectory points back to the belt. I'm not sure about this one. I think that's more about the origin of the meteorites themselves, not the source of the asteroids. Like, if a meteorite was ejected from the asteroid belt, it would have a certain trajectory. But this option is about the asteroids themselves. So maybe D is talking about the source of the meteorites, like the asteroids, not the meteorites.

Option E: The asteroid belt is the only source. That doesn't make sense. There are other sources like interstellar space, but that's probably not the main evidence.

Option F: Density matches. Maybe because the asteroid belt has a certain density, but I'm not sure if that's the main evidence. Also, density might not be the same as all meteorites.

Option G: Collisions are common and fragments trace back. Oh, this rings a bell. I think this refers to the idea that the meteorites originated from the asteroid belt because when asteroids collide, the resulting fragments follow the same path as the asteroids. So, by tracking these fragments, scientists can infer that they came from the same placeâ€” the asteroid belt.

Option H: Incriptions on meteorites. Not sure about that. Maybe inscriptions point to something else, but I can't recall that as a primary evidence.

Option I: Ejected from the asteroid belt. That's about the origin of the meteorites themselves, not the source of the asteroids. Like, if a meteorite was ejected from the asteroid belt, then it's from there.

So putting it together, the most likely answer is G. Because when asteroids collide in the asteroid belt, the resulting meteorites would have the same trajectory. By looking at the fragments of meteorites, scientists can determine where they came from, which is the asteroid belt.

The correct answer is G: The trajectory of meteorites points back to the asteroid belt. This is because when asteroids collide in the asteroid belt, the resulting fragments follow the same path as the asteroids. By studying the fragments, scientists can infer that these meteorites originated from the same source, the asteroid belt.

Answer: G
