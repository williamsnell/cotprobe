Okay, so I've got this problem here about forming a committee of 5 people from a group of 15. I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question is asking how many different possible committees can be formed. I remember that when the order of selection doesn't matter, we use combinations. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k! * (n - k)!), right? So in this case, n is 15 and k is 5.

Let me plug those numbers into the formula. So it's 15! divided by (5! times (15-5)!), which simplifies to 15! / (5! * 10!). Hmm, but calculating factorials like that is a bit tedious, especially by hand. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this without computing each factorial.

Wait, I remember that 15! can be written as 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10!. So when I divide 15! by 10!, the 10! in the denominator cancels out the same in the numerator. That leaves me with (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11) divided by (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).

Let me calculate the numerator first: 15 × 14 is 210. Then 210 × 13 is 2730. Next, 2730 × 12 is 32,760. Then 32,760 × 11 is 360,360. 

Now the denominator: 5 × 4 is 20. 20 × 3 is 60. 60 × 2 is 120. 120 × 1 is 120.

So now it's 360,360 divided by 120. Let me do that division. 360,360 ÷ 120. Well, 120 × 3,000 is 360,000. Subtract that from 360,360 and you have 360 left. 360 ÷ 120 is 3. So total is 3,000 + 3 = 3,003.

Wait, so the calculation gives me 3,003 possible committees. Looking back at the options, option A is 3,003. So that must be the right answer.

Let me quickly double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the formula, plugging in the numbers, simplifying the factorials, and then correctly calculating the numerator and denominator. Yep, that seems right. I don't see any errors in the arithmetic either. So I'm confident that the answer is option A.

The number of possible committees is calculated using combinations, which is 15 choose 5. Simplifying gives 3,003, so the answer is A.
