Okay, so I have this question about who said, "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." I'm a bit rusty on my legal terms, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let me think about what the question is asking.

First, I remember that "Jurisprudence" is a term related to the practice of law, specifically about the science of laws. It's about the rules and principles that a government should follow, right? So the statement is saying that jurisprudence is the foundation or the main point of law. That makes sense because without the legal system, laws wouldn't exist.

Now, I need to find out who said that particular statement. The options are labeled from A to J. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Pound. I think there's a person named James Watt Pound. I remember hearing that he was a leading figure in the establishment of the British Empire. Was he involved with legal terms? I'm not sure, but I don't recall him making this particular statement.

Option B: Austin. I'm pretty sure Austin is a key figure in modern legal thought. He's the father of tort law, right? So he was a big proponent of legal principles, but I don't think he specifically said that jurisprudence is the eye of law.

Option C: Savigny. I'm not familiar with Savigny's name. Maybe he was a philosopher or a law student? I don't remember him being associated with this exact statement.

Option D: Hart. John Stuart Hart is known for his work on the structure of the English legal system, specifically the creation of the English Code of Hammurabi. While he made significant contributions to legal theory, I'm not sure if he's the one who said that jurisprudence is the eye of law.

Option E: Bentham. John Stuart Bentham is a philosopher known as the founder of utilitarianism. His work is in ethics and political philosophy, not directly in law. So he's probably not the one making that legal statement.

Option F: Dworkin. I think Dworkin is a contemporary lawyer and political philosopher. He wrote about legal ethics and public policy, but again, I don't recall him making that specific legal statement about jurisprudence.

Option G: Blackstone. I'm not sure what Blackstone is known for. Maybe he's a legal historian or something. I don't remember him being the one who said that.

Option H: Laski. Laski is a Greek lawyer and statesman. He was a prominent figure in the late Roman Empire, known for his legal acumen. I don't think he contributed to this particular legal statement.

Option I: Kelsen. Kelsen's name doesn't ring a bell in this context. Maybe he's a legal figure, but I can't recall.

Option J: Maine. Maine is a lawyer and a politician, but I don't think he made that statement about jurisprudence.

Wait, maybe I'm missing someone. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider other perspectives. Let me think about the legal terms again. "Jurisprudence" refers to the science of laws, so the person's contribution to that area. I think it's more likely that someone like James Watt or John Stuart Hart made significant contributions. But I'm not sure if they specifically said that jurisprudence is the eye of law.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the origin of the phrase. It might be a paraphrase or a misstatement. Wait, I'm pretty sure that the phrase "the eye of law" is a reference to jurisprudence being the foundation of law. So the correct answer is the person who proposed that.

Wait, another approach: I'll try to recall if any legal term is associated with that. Maybe I'm confusing it with another term. Oh, wait, perhaps it's not the person but the term that was said. Alternatively, maybe it's a phrase that's been attributed to someone else.

Wait, no, the question is asking who said that the statement. So the correct answer should be the person who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." I think that's a reference to the idea that jurisprudence is the science of laws, which is the basis of all legal systems. So perhaps it was a term from a particular person.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try another angle. I remember that in some legal contexts, the term "the science of laws" or "the art of law" is mentioned. Maybe it's attributed to a particular figure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misstatement and the correct term is "the science of law" or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is someone else. Wait, maybe it's not an American person. Let me think again. Option H is Laski, who was a Greek lawyer and statesman. He was a contemporary of Euclid, but I don't recall him making that statement.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are A to J, with each letter representing a person. I think the correct answer is H, Laski, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone else.

Wait, another idea: maybe the correct answer is D, Hart. Because I remember that Hart was a leading figure in legal theory, and perhaps he wrote about the structure of the law. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone else like Blackstone, though I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the exact statement. The statement is "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." The person who said that. So the correct answer is likely one of the options. 

Looking up in my memory, I think it's a reference to a specific person. I'm pretty sure that the correct answer is Laski, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone else. Wait, another thought: I think that this statement is often attributed to the person named John Stuart Hart. He wrote about the structure of the law, including the concept of jurisprudence.

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Blackstone. I'm not sure. Another approach: think of the names in terms of their roles. Laski was a Greek statesman and lawyer, but I don't think he was known for legal terminology. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, Laski. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone else. Wait, another thought: perhaps I should think about the question again. The question is about who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." 

Wait, I think the correct answer is Laski, H. Because I remember reading that the person said that. Alternatively, perhaps it's someone else. Wait, another angle: the phrase "the eye of law" is a term often used to refer to jurisprudence. So the person who made that statement is likely H, Laski.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, Hart. But I'm not certain.

The question asks who said, "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." After analyzing the options, the correct answer is identified as **H: Laski**. This conclusion is based on the understanding that Laski, a Greek statesman and lawyer, is associated with legal thought, particularly in the context of the phrase "the science of laws" or "the art of law," which relates to the foundation of law, hence the term "the eye of law." 

Answer: H: Laski
