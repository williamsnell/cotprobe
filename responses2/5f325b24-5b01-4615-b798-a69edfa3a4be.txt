Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let's see what the question says. 

Jason is a pool cleaner in a perfectly competitive market. He can charge $10 per pool to clean 9 pools a day. His total variable costs (TVC) are $80 and total fixed costs (TFC) are $20. The question is asking about whether he should clean 9 pools a day and what his economic losses would be, or if he should shut down or make profits.

First, I remember that in a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price taker, meaning they can't set their own prices. The firm's output is determined by comparing marginal cost (MC) with the market price. If the price is above marginal cost, the firm should produce; if not, it should shut down in the short run.

So, let's break it down step by step. 

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Price (P) = $10 per pool.
   - Quantity (Q) = 9 pools.
   - TVC = $80.
   - TFC = $20.

2. **Calculate Total Costs (TC):**
   TC is the sum of TVC and TFC. So, TC = 80 + 20 = $100. 

3. **Find the Average Variable Costs (AVC):**
   AVC is TVC divided by quantity. So, AVC = 80 / 9 ≈ 8.89 (but I'll just keep it as 80/9 for now).

4. **Determine Marginal Cost (MC):**
   Wait, do I know MC? Hmm, not directly. Oh, wait, but I know that since Jason is charging $10 per pool, and if he decides to produce, he should compare the price with his marginal cost. If the price is equal to marginal cost, he'll break even. If price is higher, he should produce; if lower, he should shut down.

   Alternatively, I can think about whether the market price is higher than the average variable cost. If the market price is above average variable cost, the firm should continue producing in the short run. If it's below, the firm should shut down because it can avoid losses by shutting down.

Wait, this is key. In the short run, a firm will produce as long as the market price is greater than or equal to the average variable cost. Because if price is higher than average variable cost, they cover their variable costs and can make some profit. If price is equal to average variable cost, they break even. If price is below average variable cost, they should shut down because they can't even cover their variable costs.

So, let's find the average variable cost (AVC) for producing 9 pools. 

AVC = TVC / Q = 80 / 9 ≈ $8.89 per pool.

Wait, but in the short run, if the price is above the AVC, the firm should produce. If price is equal to or below, they shut down.

Jason is charging $10 per pool. Since $10 is greater than $8.89, he should produce 9 pools, as the price is above the average variable cost. But wait, let me think again: the price is $10, which is higher than the average variable cost, so he should produce.

Wait, but the question is giving us information that's important for determining whether he should produce or shut down. So the options suggest that sometimes he's shutting down.

Wait, let's see the options. Option D says he should clean 9 pools, with economic losses of $20. Option B says he shuts down with losses of $10. Option G says he should clean 9, with $10 losses.

Wait, I need to calculate two things: whether he should produce or shut down, and what his economic loss would be if he decides to produce or not.

First, since the price is $10, and the average variable cost is about $8.89, the firm should produce because P > AVC. So, he is better off producing.

But let me think about the total revenue. If he produces 9 pools, he gets 9 * $10 = $90.

His total costs are $100 (TC). So, his economic profit would be TR - TC = 90 - 100 = -$10. So, a loss of $10 if he produces.

But wait, if he shuts down, he can't produce any pools, so TR is zero. His total costs are $20 (TFC). So, if he shuts down, his loss is 20.

So, comparing the two options:

- If he produces, he incurs a loss of $10.
- If he shuts down, he incurs a loss of $20.

Since $10 loss is better (lower in absolute terms) than $20, he should choose to produce and incur a loss of $10.

Looking back at the options, option D says he should clean 9 pools, with $10 loss. Option B says he shuts down with $10 loss.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is true. So, is D correct? Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the firm is making a positive profit or not. Because if the price is above average variable cost, the firm can at least cover all variable costs and contribute to fixed costs. So, the firm should produce, but the profit (or loss) would be negative.

Let me compute it again. 

TR = 9 * 10 = $90.

TC = 80 + 20 = $100.

Profit = TR - TC = -10. So, he makes a loss of $10.

So, option D is correct: he should clean 9 pools, with a loss of $10.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option E: He shuts down with $10 profit. No, that doesn't make sense. If he shuts down, he can't make any revenue, so his loss is TFC, which is $20. So, E is wrong.

Option B: He shuts down, with $10 loss. No, because if he shuts down, he loses TFC ($20) but not any revenue. So B is incorrect.

Option G: He cleans 9 pools, $10 loss. Correct.

Option H: He shuts down, $10 profit. No.

Option I: He shuts down, $10 economic profits. No, because he can't make any revenue.

Option J: He cleans 9, $10 profit. No, same reasoning as I.

So the correct answer is D. But wait, looking at the options, let me double-check. Wait, there's a catch.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the firm should shut down if the price is below average variable cost. Let me think again.

In the short run, any firm will produce as long as the price is at least equal to the average variable cost. If price is below average variable cost, the firm should shut down because it can't cover its variable costs and would incur additional losses in the long run by not producing.

So, in this case, the price is $10, which is above the average variable cost (≈8.89). Therefore, the firm should produce, not shut down.

So, if he produces, he incurs a loss of $10. So option D says he should clean 9 and have a $10 loss. That's correct.

But wait, another approach: the firm's economic loss is maximum when it's shut down. So, when price is below AVC, it will shut down, making a loss of TFC.

In this case, price is above AVC, so it will produce, making a loss of TR - (TFC + TVC).

Wait, TR is 90, TFC + TVC is 120. So, 90-120 = -30? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no. Because TFC is 20, and TVC is 80. So, TFC + TVC is 100. TR is 90. So, 90-100= -10. So, the loss is 10.

So, the correct answer is D.
</think>

Jason is a profit-maximizing pool cleaner in a perfectly competitive market. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the situation based on the given information:

1. **Given Data:**
   - Price (P) = $10 per pool.
   - Quantity (Q) = 9 pools.
   - Total Variable Costs (TVC) = $80.
   - Total Fixed Costs (TFC) = $20.

2. **Calculations:**
   - Total Costs (TC) = TVC + TFC = $80 + $20 = $100.
   - Average Variable Cost (AVC) = TVC / Q = $80 / 9 ≈ $8.89.
   - Total Revenue (TR) = P × Q = $10 × 9 = $90.
   - Economic Loss if Producing = TR - TC = $90 - $100 = -$10.

3. **Decision:**
   - Since the price ($10) is above the average variable cost ($8.89), Jason should produce 9 pools. This ensures he covers his variable costs and can contribute to covering fixed costs, minimizing losses.

4. **Economic Loss:**
   - If Jason produces, his economic loss is $10.

5. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option D:** Correct. Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with an economic loss of $10.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. If Jason shuts down, his loss would be $20 (only TFC). He should not shut down because the price exceeds the average variable cost.
   - **Options A, C, E, F, G, H, J:** Incorrect. These options either suggest shutting down or producing but with incorrect economic losses or incorrect conclusions about whether to produce or shut down.
