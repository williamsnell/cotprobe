Okay, so I have this question about the minimum number of people needed in a room to guarantee that there are 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers. Hmm, I remember hearing about this in a math class, probably something to do with graph theory or combinatorics. Wait, isn't this related to Ramsey numbers? Yeah, I think Ramsey numbers deal with conditions under which order must appear. So, the problem is asking for the Ramsey number R(3,3), which is the smallest number where you can't avoid having either a group of 3 friends or 3 strangers.

Let me think. I remember that Ramsey numbers are denoted as R(m,n), which is the smallest number of vertices such that any graph of that size contains at least one clique of size m or an independent set of size n. In this question, m and n are both 3. So, R(3,3) is the number we're looking for.

Wait, what's the value of R(3,3)? I think it's 6. So, the minimum number of people needed is 6. But wait, let me make sure. Oh, no, wait, I might be mixing it up. Let me think again. I recall that R(3,3) is 6, meaning that in any group of 6 people, there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers. But wait, I also remember that R(4,4) is 18, which is a much larger number. So, for R(3,3), the number is 6. So, the correct answer should be 6. Looking back at the options, option J is 6. So, the answer should be J.

The question is about finding the minimum number of people needed to guarantee 3 mutual friends or strangers. This is a Ramsey problem, specifically R(3,3) = 6.
