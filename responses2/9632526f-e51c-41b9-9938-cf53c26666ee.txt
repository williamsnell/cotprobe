Okay, so I have this equation here: 6a equals 72. And I need to find the value of 'a'. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on algebra, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that to solve for a variable, I need to isolate it. So in this case, 'a' is being multiplied by 6. To get 'a' by itself, I should perform the opposite operationâ€”so that's dividing by 6. Wait, but what exactly do I do? Let me think. If I have 6a = 72, and I want to get 'a' alone, I should divide both sides by 6. That way, I'm keeping the equation balanced.

So, dividing both sides by 6 would give me (6a)/6 on the left side, which simplifies to just 'a'. And on the right side, 72 divided by 6 is 12. So a should be 12. 

Let me look at the options again. Option A is "divide both sides by 6". That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option B is "multiply both sides by 6". Wait, if I multiply both sides by 6, that would give me 36a = 432, which doesn't help me find 'a' because 'a' would be multiplied by 36. So that's not the way to go. 

Option C is "add 6 to 72". That doesn't make sense because that would just give me 78, but I'm trying to solve for 'a', not a new value.

Option D is "add 6 to both sides". Again, adding 6 to both sides would change the equation to 6a +6 =78, but that doesn't help me isolate 'a' either.

Option E is "subtract 72 from both sides". That would give me 6a -72 =0, which doesn't help find 'a' because I'm not isolating it.

Option F is "add 72 to both sides". That would make it 6a +72 =144, which is also not helpful.

Option G is "divide both sides by 72". Wait, why would I divide by 72? If I have 6a =72, dividing both sides by 72 would give me a =72/6, which is 12. But that's the same as option A, just reversed. Wait, but option A is the correct step. Option G is actually incorrect because 72 divided by 6 is 12, which is the solution. Option A is correct, so G is not an option, but in any case, the correct action is to divide both sides by 6, not 72.

Option H is "multiply both sides by 72", which would give me 432a = 5184, which is even worse.

Option I is "subtract 6 from 72", which doesn't make sense because it's just an operation, not an algebraic manipulation.

Option J is "subtract 6 from both sides", which would give 6a -6 =72. That's correct in the sense that it's a step, but it's not the way to solve for 'a'. Because I need to get rid of the 6 on the left, I should divide, not subtract.

So the correct step is option A: divide both sides by 6. That's the one that gets me to a=12.

The correct step to solve for 'a' is to divide both sides by 6. This isolates 'a' and yields the solution 12.

Answer: A
