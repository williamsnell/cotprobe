Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a discounted note, and I need to calculate the proceeds. Hmm.

Okay, so the facts are: Owsen Company accepted a draft (which is a written note promising to pay someone at a future date) that's 90 days in sight. The amount drawn is $560. This draft is discounted 34 days before the due date at a discount rate of 6%. I need to find out the proceeds, which would be the amount the bank receives after discounting.

Wait, so the discounting period is 34 days before the due date. The due date is 90 days from now. So, 90 minus 34 is 56 days. That means the note is discounted 56 days before it's due. 

I remember that when a note is discounted, the bank subtracts the interest (discount) from the face value. The formula I think is: Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value * Discount Rate * Time). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Like, the amount received is Face Value minus the interest. So the discount is the interest.

Wait, let's clarify. The discount rate is 6%, and the time is 56 days. So the discount would be calculated on the face value for 56 days. 

Wait, but time in financial calculations is usually in days, but it's expressed as a fraction of the year, right? So 56 days out of 360 days (assuming a 360-day year) or 365 days. Hmm, I'm not sure which to use here. Let me think. In some financial contexts, 360 days are used for calculations, especially in the U.S. for loans. So maybe in this case, it's 360 days.

Wait, wait. I think the standard is to use 360 days for these calculations when dealing with discount notes. So the time factor would be 56/360, which is 56/360 = 0.155555...

So the discount amount is Face Value multiplied by the rate multiplied by the time.

Face value is $560, rate is 6% or 0.06, time is 56/360.

So, discount = 560 * 0.06 * (56/360).

Let me calculate that. 560 * 0.06 is 33.6. Then multiply by 56/360.

Wait, 56/360 is 0.155555... So 33.6 * 0.155555 is approximately 5.2. So the discount is about $5.20.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. 56/360 is 0.1555555556. So 33.6 * 0.1555555556.

Let me compute 33.6 * 56 = 1881.6. Then divide by 360. 360 goes into 1881.6 how many times?

1881.6 divided by 360 is 5.2. So the discount is $5.20.

So the proceeds would be Face Value minus discount: 560 - 5.20 = 554.80.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the time is 56 days, but the discount is calculated as the number of days the note is held before discounting. Hence, the discount is for 56 days.

Wait another approach: The formula for discount is D = F * R * T, where D is discount, F is face value, R is rate, T is time.

So D = 560 * 0.06 * (56/360) = 560 * 0.06 = 33.6, then 33.6 * 56/360.

Calculating 56/360 = 0.1555555556. 33.6 * 0.1555555556 is 5.2. So D is $5.20.

Proceeds are F - D = 560 - 5.20 = 554.80.

Looking at the options, option H is $556.83, D is $558.50, E is 562, etc. Wait, none of the options is $554.80. Hmm. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me double-check.

The note is 90 days in sight. It's discounted 34 days before due. So the time the bank holds the note is 90 -34 = 56 days. So that part seems right.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in discounting, the time is calculated as the number of days you hold it, but maybe in this case, the time is 90 days minus 34 days. So 56 days is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use 365 days instead of 360? Let me try that.

If T is 56/365, then 56/365 is approximately 0.1534246575.

Then D = 560 * 0.06 * 0.1534246575.

560 * 0.06 is 33.6. 33.6 * 0.1534246575 = 5.165. So D is approximately $5.17.

Proceeds would be 560 -5.17 = 554.83, which is approximately $554.83.

Wait, but that's still not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are: A:560, B:550, C:555, D:558.5, E:562, F:558, G:563.17, H:556.83, I:553.83, J:551.67.

Hmm, none of these are close to 554.80. Did I miscalculate the time?

Wait, perhaps the time is 34 days before due, so the note is discounted 34 days early, meaning 90-34=56 days. So the time is 56 days.

Wait, perhaps the way the question is phrased is that the discount is applied 34 days before, but that would mean that the note is discounted for 34 days, but the due date is 90 days.

Wait, maybe I got the time wrong. Let me think again. The note is accepted on day 0, and the due date is day 90. The bank discounts it 34 days before. So the note is discounted on day 34, and maturing on day 90. So the time the bank holds the note is 90-34 =56 days.

So I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe the discount is calculated as the number of days the bank has the note, so 56 days. So the discount is 560 * 0.06 * (56/360). Let me compute that more accurately.

560 * 0.06 = 33.6.

33.6 * 56 = 1,881.6. Then 1,881.6 divided by 360 is:

1,881.6 / 360 = 5.20.

So D is $5.20.

So proceeds are 560 -5.20 = 554.80.

But none of the options match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think about the formula again.

The formula is: Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value * Rate * Time). 

Is that correct? So the discount is Face * Rate * Time.

Yes, that's correct. So I think that's right.

Wait, another possibility: sometimes, the time is considered as the number of days the note is held, but perhaps it's being counted as 30 days per month. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the discount is calculated as 56 days, but the rate is 6% per 360 days. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, 56 days is roughly 0.1555555556 of a year. 0.06 is 6% per year. So 0.06 * 0.1555555556 is 0.00933333333. Then 560 * 0.00933333333 is 560 * 0.00933333333 = 5.2.

So same result.

Wait, perhaps the time is 34 days, not 56. Let me see. If the note is discounted 34 days before the due date, then the time is 34 days. So that would be 34/360. Let's check.

D would be 560 * 0.06 * (34/360).

54/360 is 0.0944444444.

So 560 * 0.06 =33.6.

33.6 * 0.0944444444 = 3.17333333.

So D is $3.17. Proceeds would be 560 -3.17 =556.83.

Which is option H.

Wait, that would give 560 - 3.17 =556.83.

Hmm, that's one of the options, option H.

So why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought the discount period was 56 days, which led to a different result. But the question says it's discounted 34 days before the due date. So the time is 34 days, not 56.

Wait, that's a key point. So the discount period is 34 days. So the time is 34 days.

So D = 560 * 0.06 * (34/360).

Let me compute that again.

34/360 is 0.0944444444.

560 * 0.06 =33.6.

33.6 * 0.0944444444 = let's calculate that.

33.6 * 0.09 =3.024. 33.6 * 0.0044444444 = approx 0.150666666. So total D is 3.024 +0.150666666 ≈3.17466664. So D is approximately $3.17.

Proceeds: 560 - 3.17466664 ≈556.825333.

Which is approximately $556.83, which is option H.

Wait, but wait, the question says 34 days before the due date. So the time the bank holds the note is 34 days. So discount period is 34 days.

So I think that's correct.

So the answer should be option H: $556.83.

Wait, but the initial calculation I did with 56 days resulted in 554.80, which is not an option. So that indicates a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is discounted 34 days before the due date, meaning that the discount is applied 34 days before. So the discount is for 34 days. Then the proceeds would be 560 - (560 * 0.06 * (34/360)) = 560 - (560 *0.06) * (34/360).

Which is exactly what I did.

So the correct answer is H: $556.83.

Wait, but the options include H as 556.83, which matches.

To determine the proceeds of the discounted note, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Proceeds} = \text{Face Value} - (\text{Face Value} \times \text{Discount Rate} \times \text{Time}) \]

1. **Face Value (FV):** $560  
2. **Discount Rate (R):** 6% or 0.06  
3. **Time (T):** 34 days (discounted 34 days before the due date)  
4. **Days in a year:** 360 (assumed for calculation purposes)  

First, calculate the time factor:

\[ T = \frac{34}{360} = 0.094444 \]

Then, calculate the discount:

\[ \text{Discount} = 560 \times 0.06 \times 0.094444 = 560 \times 0.0056666664 \approx 3.1733333 \]

Finally, calculate the proceeds:

\[ \text{Proceeds} = 560 - 3.1733333 \approx 556.8266667 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the proceeds are approximately **$556.83**.
