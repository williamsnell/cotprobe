Okay, so I've got this problem about a cylindrical pressure vessel, and I need to find the thickness required. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the formulas for pressure vessels involve the hoop stress and axial stress, but since this is about thickness, maybe I need to focus on the hoop stress part.

The problem says the vessel is cylindrical, so I should probably use the formula for hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder. Oh wait, but wait—oh, wait, sometimes pressure vessels can be thick-walled, but the question doesn't specify. Oh well, maybe we can assume it's a thin-walled one because they only give us some parameters like mean radius and internal pressure. Or maybe they want us to use the thin-walled formula.

Wait, the mean radius is 15 inches. So the diameter would be 30 inches. The internal pressure is 3500 psi. The yield strength is 120,000 psi, and the factor of safety is 1.5. Oh, and the welded connections have a factor of safety of 78%, but maybe that's not directly needed for the thickness calculation. Or maybe it's included in the yield strength? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the material's yield strength is given as sigma_y = 12 × 10^4 psi. So that's 120,000 psi. The factor of safety is 1.5. So the actual allowable stress would be sigma_y divided by the factor of safety. So 120,000 /1.5 = 80,000 psi.

Wait, but the problem is talking about the vessel's strength, so perhaps the internal pressure is within the yield strength. Or maybe not. But I think for the hoop stress calculation, we use the yield strength.

Wait, but the vessel's walls are made of a material that could possibly have a yield stress. So the maximum allowable hoop stress would be sigma_y / safety factor.

Oh, wait, the factor of safety is given for the vessel's strength. So the allowable stress is sigma_y divided by the factor of safety. So sigma_allow = 120,000 / 1.5 = 80,000 psi.

But wait, the vessel's material's yield strength is 120,000 psi, so the maximum allowable stress is sigma_allow = 80,000 psi.

So the hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder is given by sigma_hoop = (P * D) / (2*t), where P is the internal pressure, D is diameter, t is thickness.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is a thin-walled cylinder. The mean radius is 15 in, so the diameter is 30 inches. If the thickness is t, then for a thin-walled cylinder, the hoop stress is approximately (P * D)/(2t). 

So let's plug in the numbers.

P = 3500 psi
D = 30 inches
sigma_allow = 80,000 psi.

So sigma_hoop = (3500 * 30) / (2t) = (105,000)/(2t) = 52,500 / t.

Set this equal to sigma_allow, 80,000:

52,500 / t = 80,000

Solving for t:

t = 52,500 / 80,000 = 0.65625 inches.

Wait, that's approximately 0.656 inches. Looking at the options, option A is 0.65 in. So the thickness would be about 0.65 inches.

Wait, but wait, is this a thin-walled cylinder? Because for a thick-walled cylinder, the hoop stress is different. Oh, right, the formula for a thick-walled cylinder is sigma_hoop = (P * D)/(4t) and sigma_axial = P. But since the problem didn't specify if it's a thick or thin-walled, but the mean radius is 15 in, which is quite large compared to the pressure. Let's think: the pressure is 3500 psi and mean radius is 15 inches. So pressure per unit area is 3500 psi. The diameter is 30 inches, so the pressure per inch of diameter is 3500 psi per 30 inches. Hmm, 3500 psi per 30 inches is 116.67 psi per inch. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the stress formula.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives a factor of safety of 1.5, but perhaps that's for the vessel's strength, not the stress? No, I think the factor of safety for the vessel is 1.5, meaning the actual stress is 1.5 times the allowable stress.

Wait, let me double-check. The yield strength is the maximum stress the material can handle before yielding. So the allowable stress is sigma_y / factor_of_safety = 120,000 / 1.5 = 80,000 psi.

So the hoop stress must not exceed 80,000 psi. The formula for hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder is sigma_hoop = (P * D)/(2t). So set that equal to 80,000 psi.

So,

80,000 = (3500 * 30) / (2 t)
80,000 = 105,000 / (2t)
Multiply both sides by 2t:
160,000 t = 105,000
t = 105,000 / 160,000
t = 0.65625 inches, which is approximately 0.656 inches.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 0.65 in.

So the answer should be A.

To determine the thickness of the cylindrical pressure vessel, we use the formula for hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder:

\[
\sigma_{\text{hoop}} = \frac{P \cdot D}{2t}
\]

where:
- \( P = 3500 \, \text{psi} \) (internal pressure),
- \( D = 30 \, \text{in} \) (diameter, calculated as \( 2 \times 15 \, \text{in} \)),
- \( \sigma_{\text{allowable}} = \frac{\sigma_y}{\text{factor of safety}} = \frac{120,000}{1.5} = 80,000 \, \text{psi} \) (allowable hoop stress).

Setting the hoop stress equal to the allowable stress:

\[
80,000 = \frac{3500 \cdot 30}{2t}
\]

Simplify and solve for \( t \):

\[
80,000 = \frac{105,000}{2t} \implies 160,000t = 105,000 \implies t = \frac{105,000}{160,000} \approx 0.65625 \, \text{in}.
\]

The calculated thickness is approximately \( 0.656 \, \text{in} \), which rounds to \( 0.65 \, \text{in} \). Among the given options, the closest value is **0.65 in**.
