Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Chinese process of divining the future by examining fired animal bones. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I need to figure out what each option refers to. The question is asking what's called when people look at bones to predict the future. I'm trying to recall any traditional Chinese practices related to this.

I remember that in Chinese culture, there's a significant belief in animals, especially the dead. People often interpret bones as spirits or signs of the future. But I'm not exactly sure what the specific term is for this method. Let me think about the options provided.

Option A is "hang-t'u." I think that's a term I've heard before in Chinese culture, possibly related to divination or prognosis. It might be a traditional Chinese method. 

Option B is "scapulimancy." I'm not sure what that means. Maybe it's a term used in some contexts, but I'm not certain about its origin or relevance here.

Option C is "I Ching." Wait, isn't that the Chinese trigram, or hexagram, which is about the art of predicting the future using hexagrams? So that's more related to the I Ching or Chinese philosophy, not directly tied to looking at bones.

Option D is "geomancy." I'm pretty sure that's the correct term in English. Geomancy is the practice of divination using things like plants, animals, and symbols. I've heard it referred to in various Chinese contexts, but I'm not sure about the specific name.

Option E is "Kau Cim." I'm not familiar with this term. Maybe it's a term used in another language or region, but I don't think it's the standard term for this method.

Option F is "cylinder seal prophecy." That sounds like a Chinese myth or legend, not a recognized practice for divination. I don't recall cylinder seals being used for future predictions.

Option G is "Tung Shing." I'm not familiar with this term either. Maybe it's a term from another culture, but not relevant here.

Option H is "sarsen divination." I'm not sure about this term. Maybe it's a term used in another language, but I don't recall sarsen being a term used in divination practices.

So, putting it all together. The question is about a method in Chinese culture where people look at fired animal bones to predict the future. I'm pretty sure this is called "hang-t'u." It's a traditional method, and I think it's one of the oldest forms of divination in China.

I also remember that other terms like scapulimancy might refer to something else, but I'm not certain. So, the best fit here should be A: hang-t'u.

The correct answer is A: hang-t'u. This term refers to the traditional Chinese method of divination where individuals examine the remains of dead animals to predict the future. 

Answer: A
