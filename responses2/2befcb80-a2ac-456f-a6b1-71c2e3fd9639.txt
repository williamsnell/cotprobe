Question:

A man who owned a business believed that one of his employees was stealing computer equipment from the business. He decided to break into the employee's house one night, when he knew that the employee and her family would be away, to try to find and retrieve the equipment. The man had brought a picklock to open the employee's back door, but when he tried the door, he found that it was unlocked, so he entered. As the man was looking around the house, he heard sounds outside and became afraid. He left the house but was arrested by police on neighborhood patrol. What is the man's strongest defense to a burglary charge?

Options:

A: The back door to the house was unlocked.
B: The man was scared and left the house before committing a crime.
C: The man did not actually use the picklock.
D: The man was arrested outside, not inside, the house.
E: The man was only trying to retrieve his own property.
F: The man did not intend to commit a crime inside the house.
G: The man believed the stolen property was his.
H: The house was not occupied at the time of his entry.
I: The man did not take anything from the house.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a man who had a business and one of his employees was stealing computer equipment. He broke into the employee's house knowing she and her family would be away that night. He brought a picklock, tried to open the door, and it was unlocked. He went in, but then he got scared and left the house. He was arrested by police. 

The question is, what's the man's strongest defense if he's facing a burglary charge. The options are A to I, and the last answer has to end with the letter chosen.

So, let's break it down. burglary charges generally involve the unlawful entry into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony, or the unlawful entry without purpose or intent to commit a felony. Here, the man used a picklock to open the door, which might be evidence of breaking in. But he was aware the employee was away.

Wait, but the question says he broke into the house. So, the immediate defense is perhaps that the property was taken, but the options include whether he intended to commit a crime inside. Looking at the options, option F says he didn't intend to commit a crime. So, he was planning to steal, which makes sense because he thought the employee was away. But is that the strongest defense?

Alternatively, he knew the employee was away, so he might have had knowledge that she was not there, which could be a defense. But the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: The back door was unlocked. That's a direct physical evidence that he was able to enter. But in burglary, typically you need intent. If he didn't intend to commit a crime, just happened to break in, then that's a defense, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest.

Option B: He was scared and left before committing a crime. That's a defense because he believed he was about to commit the crime and didn't take action. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest. It's possible, but perhaps the intent defense is more direct.

Option E: He was only trying to retrieve his own property. So, he thought he was not about to steal, so he didn't intend to enter. That's a defense because he thought he was not going to commit a crime. But is that a stronger defense than the intent?

Option D: He was arrested outside. That seems less likely because he was at the house, and the police were there to arrest him in the house. So, not outside.

Option G: He believed the stolen property was his. So, he thought the computer was his, so he didn't take anything. But was that a defense? He thought it was his property, but he didn't intend to take it. So perhaps that's a defense.

Option F: He didn't intend to commit a crime. So, he thought he was not going to do it, but that's a pretty broad defense. But it's not clear if that's the strongest.

Option I: He didn't take anything. So he didn't steal anything, but again, that doesn't involve intent.

Option C: He didn't use the picklock. That's a defense because he thought he was not going to commit the crime, so he didn't take anything. So, option C would be that he didn't use the picklock, meaning he didn't actually break in. But wait, the question says he broke into the house with the picklock, so he did break in. So, option C would be incorrect because he did use it. So, that's not a valid defense.

So, the options are about intent. The intent defense. The strongest would be whether he had the intent to break in. Since he knew the employee was away, perhaps that's a defense. But the options don't have an option that says he knew or thought the employee wasn't there. But perhaps option A is about the door being unlocked, which is physical evidence.

But the options don't have an option that says he knew she was away or was under the impression she wasn't there. So, the strongest defense is probably that he didn't intend to commit a crime inside the house. Because the intent is a key element. So, F: he didn't intend to commit a crime.

Wait, but the options are A to I. Let me check each option again.

Option F: He didn't intend to commit a crime inside. That's a strong argument. Because if he knew the employee was away, he might have had the intent. But perhaps that's not a valid defense, because intent is often tied to knowledge or belief. So, perhaps the intent defense is more about the belief that he was about to commit the crime, which is a defense under the doctrine of "no knowledge" or "no belief" argument. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, the intent could be that he had the intent to break in, even without knowing she was away. So, the intent defense is that he intended to break into the house, knowing or not knowing the employee wasn't there. So, in that case, perhaps the intent defense is the strongest.

Wait, the options include option F (no intent), which is a common defense. The idea is that you can't commit a crime without intent. So, if he was thinking he was not going to commit a crime, that's a defense because intent is required for burglary.

So, the strongest defense would be F: he didn't intend to commit a crime.

The man's strongest defense would be based on the intent to commit a crime. Since he knew the employee was away or believed she was not there, he likely had the intent to steal. This intent is a critical element of burglary charges. Among the options, the strongest defense is that he did not intend to commit a crime inside the house, as this directly ties to the criminal intent required for burglary.
