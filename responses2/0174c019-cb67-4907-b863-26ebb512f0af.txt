Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the pH of a hydrogen peroxide solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The solution is 30% by weight H2O2. Wait, that's a lot. And the density is given as 1.11 g/cm³. Oh right, because density affects how much of the solution is present. And the dissociation constant (Ka) is 1.0e-12, which is pretty small. I remember that for weak acids, the pH calculation involves finding the concentration of H+ ions.

First, I think I need to find the molarity of the solution. Because for weak acids, we usually use the formula involving the square root of (2cKa), but wait, wait. Oh right, when the concentration is low, the dissociation isn't negligible, so maybe it's a case where we can't ignore the dissociation. Wait, but wait another thing: if the solution is dilute, the dissociation is small, but the dissociation constant is small, which would mean that the concentration isn't extremely high. Hmm, maybe I can proceed.

Wait, let's outline the steps.

1. Calculate the mass of H2O2 in a certain volume of solution.
2. Then calculate the mass of the solution to find the volume.
3. Convert that to molarity (moles per liter).
4. Use the dissociation to find [H+] and then pH.

Wait, let's start with step 1. The solution is 30% H2O2 by weight. So for every 100g of solution, there's 30g H2O2 and 70g water.

Wait, but to find the molarity, I need moles per liter. So first, I need to find the volume of solution corresponding to 1 liter.

But wait, the density is 1.11 g/cm³, which is 1.11 g/mL. So 1 liter is 1000 mL, so 1000 mL * 1.11 g/mL = 1110 grams of solution.

So in 1 liter of solution, there's 1110g. Of that, 30% is H2O2: 30% of 1110 is 333 g H2O2.

Wait, then the mass of H2O2 is 333g. Now, since H2O2 has a molar mass, I can find the number of moles.

The molar mass of H2O2 is 2*(1.008) + 16.00*2 = 34.016 g/mol.

So moles = 333g / 34.016 g/mol ≈ let's compute that. 333 ÷ 34 ≈ 9.8 (since 34 *9 = 306, 34*10=340 → 333-306=27 → 27/34 ≈ 0.794. So about 9.794 moles. Wait, but that's for 1110g of solution, which is 1 L. So the molarity is 9.794 M. But wait, wait, that can't be right because if the solution is 30% H2O2, and the concentration is high, the dissociation may not be negligible. Oh wait, but wait, the Ka is 1e-12, which is very small. So the solution is weak, so the dissociation is small.

Wait, but wait, let's proceed carefully.

So I have 9.794 moles in 1 liter → 9.794 M.

But wait, but the way I calculated, 30% by weight is 333g H2O2 in 1110g solution. So the density is 1.11 g/cm³. That's correct. So 1 liter is 1000 mL → 1000 *1.11 = 1110g solution.

So 30% is 30% of 1110 → 333g H2O2.

Molar mass of H2O2 is 34.016 g/mol.

333g /34.016 ≈ 9.794 mol. So 9.794 M.

But wait, that's a high concentration. For 9 M H2O2, the pH would be way higher. Let me think about whether that's correct.

Wait, but wait, wait, H2O2 is a weak acid, so it dissociates only slightly. So maybe my approach is wrong. Maybe the solution isn't that concentrated, because 30% by weight is a lot, but perhaps in a larger volume, the concentration would be lower.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the steps again.

The solution's density is 1.11 g/cm³, so 1 liter is 1000 cm³ → 1000 * 1.11 = 1110 grams.

30% H2O2 → 333g H2O2.

Molar mass of H2O2: 34.016 g/mol. So moles = 333 /34.016 ≈ 9.794 mol. So 9.794 M H2O2.

But wait, if the concentration is 9.794 M, then for H2O2 dissociation:

H2O2 ↔ 2 H+ + O^2-

Ka = [H+]² / [H2O2]

But wait, 9.794 M is a high concentration. I remember that for strong acids, you don't need to worry about dilution. But H2O2 is a weak acid, so perhaps I should use the approximation for weak acids, but when the concentration is very high, maybe the dissociation is still not negligible.

Wait, but if the concentration is 9.8 M, then the dissociation would be such that [H+] is approx sqrt(2 c Ka). But wait, Ka is 1e-12, so sqrt(2 *9.8 *1e-12)= sqrt(1.96e-11) ≈ 4.427e-6 M.

Wait, then pH would be -log(4.427e-6) which is around 5.35. But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option E (9.79) or F (3.13), which are 9.8 and 3.13. Hmm, but the options don't have 5.35.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 30% of 1110g is 333g H2O2.

333g /34.016 g/mol ≈ 9.794 mol. So that's correct.

The molarity is 9.794 M.

So for a weak acid, [H+]^2 = c * Ka → [H+] = sqrt(c * Ka)

So [H+] = sqrt(9.794 * 1e-12) = sqrt(9.794) *1e-6.

Wait, sqrt(9.794) is about 3.129. So [H+] = 3.129e-6 M.

Wait, then pH is -log(3.129e-6) ≈ 5.50.

Wait, but looking at the options, there's option F as 3.13. Hmm, that's about 3.13, which is much lower.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, what if the solution isn't 9.8 M? Because wait, perhaps the density is high, but the molarity is calculated as moles per liter. Hmm, perhaps I should have considered that the solution's density is 1.11 g/cm³, so 1 liter is 1000 mL → 1000 *1.11=1110 grams. Then, 30% H2O2 → 333 grams. Moles = 333/34.016=9.794, which gives 9.794 M. So that's correct.

Hmm, but then according to our calculation, the pH should be around 5.5, but none of the options are exactly that. Let's look at the options:

Options:

A:4.27

B:2.07

C:5.5

D: 1e-12

E:9.79

F:3.13

G:7.45

H:10.5

I:6.8

J:8.34

So option C is 5.5, which is close to our calculation of 5.50. So perhaps the correct answer is C:5.5.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me double-check.

Wait, 30% by weight of 1110g solution is 333g H2O2. Moles of H2O2 = 333 /34.016 = approximately 9.794 mol.

Yes, that's right. So [H+] is sqrt(9.794 *1e-12) → sqrt(9.794e-12) = approximately 3.129e-6 M.

pH is -log(3.129e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.129e-6) is log(3.129) + (-6). Log(3) is 0.477, log(3.129) is about 0.497. So 0.497 -6 = -5.503. So pH is 5.503. So about 5.5.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.5. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Hmmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the solution is so concentrated that the dissociation is not negligible. Oh, but the problem says to assume a dissociation constant of 1e-12, which is pretty low. So the solution is weak, so the assumption holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the question is phrased, the concentration is not 9.794 M. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, wait, the solution is 30% by weight, which is 333g H2O2 in 1 L.

Wait, but H2O2's density is 1.11g/cm³. So in 1 L (1000g), the solution would be 1000g /1.11g/cm³ = approximately 900 cm³ (since 1g/cm³ is 1 cm³ per gram). So 1000g is 900 cm³, which is 900 mL. So the solution is 30% by weight, so 30% of 900 mL would be 270 mL. Wait, no, wait, that's not correct. Because the total solution is 1000g, which is 900 mL (since 1g/cm³ is 1 mL). So 30% of 1000g is 300g H2O2 in the 1000g solution, which is 300g /1.11 g/cm³ = about 270.27 cm³ (270.27 mL). So the solution's volume is 270.27 mL. Oh wait, but wait, no. Because the density is 1.11 g/cm³, so 1000g is 900 mL (since 1g/cm³=1g/mL → 1000g=1000 mL → wait, that's not correct. Because density is mass/volume. So density = mass/volume → volume = mass/density. So 1000g /1.11g/cm³ ≈ 900.9 cm³, which is 900.9 mL.

So the solution is 900.9 mL. So 30% of 1000g is 300g in 900.9 mL.

Molar mass of H2O2 is 34.016 g/mol → moles = 300 /34.016 ≈ 8.82 moles.

Wait, that's different from the 9.794 I had earlier. Why is there a discrepancy?

Oh, because in the first approach, I assumed that the entire 1110 g is 1 liter, but the solution's volume is 900.9 mL. So my mistake earlier was taking the solution's volume as 1000 mL, but that's incorrect.

Ah, that's a key point. So I need to correct that.

So let me recalculate.

Density is 1.11 g/cm³ = 1.11 g/mL.

1 liter is 1000 mL. So the mass of 1 L is 1000 mL * 1.11 g/mL = 1110 g.

But the solution is 1110g, 30% H2O2: 333g H2O2.

But the volume of the solution is 1000 mL (since 1 liter is 1000 mL), but the solution's actual volume is less when considering the density. So that approach was wrong.

So the correct way is to find the volume of the solution given as 1 liter, but the solution is not 1000 mL because it's less dense. Wait, no. The density is 1.11g/mL, so 1000 mL * 1.11g/mL = 1110g. So for 1 L of solution (1000g), the volume would be 1000 /1.11 ≈ 900.9 mL. So 1 L solution has volume 900.9 mL.

So in 900.9 mL solution, 300g H2O2. So the molarity is moles H2O2 / volume in liters.

Molarity = (300g /34.016 g/mol) / (0.9009 L) = (8.82 mol) / 0.9009 L ≈ 9.8 mol/L.

Wait, wait, 300g /34.016 = 8.82 mol. 0.9009 liters.

So 8.82 / 0.9009 ≈ 9.794, same as before. So the initial calculation was correct.

So [H+] is sqrt( c * Ka ) → c is 9.794 M, Ka 1e-12. So [H+] = sqrt(9.794e-12) → sqrt(9.794)*1e-6 → approx 3.13e-6 M.

Wait, but wait, 3.13e-6 is 3.13 ×1e-6 → pH is -log(3.13e-6). Let's compute that.

Log(3.13) is about 0.495. So log(3.13e-6) = 0.495 -6 = -5.505. So pH is 5.505 → approx 5.5.

So the correct answer is option C:5.5.

But wait, in the options, option E is 9.79, option C is 5.5. Another possibility is I made a mistake in calculating the dissociation.

Wait, but another way: maybe I should consider the dissociation as a small fraction. Because if the solution is 30% H2O2, then the initial concentration is high, but the dissociation isn't so small that it can be ignored.

Wait, let's proceed with the correct approach. The solution is 9.794 M H2O2, which is a weak acid. So the dissociation is:

H2O2 ↔ 2 H+ + O^2-
Ka = [H+]²/(c - x) ≈ [H+]²/(c) → assuming x is small compared to c, which might not be the case if c is 9.794.

Wait, but 9.794 is a high concentration. So perhaps the assumption x << c isn't valid. We can't ignore the x.

Wait, so let's set up the exact equation:

Ka = ([H+]^2) / (c - x) 

But when c is large, and x is small, perhaps the denominator is approx c. Let's see:

Ka = (x^2) / (c) → x = sqrt(Ka * c)

But when c is high, but Ka is 1e-12. Let's compute x.

x = sqrt( (1e-12)(9.794) ) = sqrt(9.794e-12) → approx 3.129e-6 M.

Which is the same as before. So, [H+] = 3.129e-6 → pH ~5.5.

So the correct answer is option C:5.5.

To calculate the pH of a 30% by weight solution of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) with a density of 1.11 g/cm³ and a dissociation constant (Ka) of \(1.0 \times 10^{-12}\), the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine the mass of H₂O₂ in 1 liter of solution:**
   - The density of the solution is 1.11 g/cm³, so 1 liter (1000 mL) of solution weighs \(1000 \, \text{mL} \times 1.11 \, \text{g/mL} = 1110 \, \text{g}\).
   - Since the solution is 30% by weight, the mass of H₂O₂ in 1 liter is \(30\% \times 1110 \, \text{g} = 333 \, \text{g}\).

2. **Calculate the molarity of H₂O₂:**
   - The molar mass of H₂O₂ is \(2(1.008) + 16.00 = 34.016 \, \text{g/mol}\).
   - Molarity (\(c\)) is given by \(\text{moles of solute} / \text{volume of solution in liters}\):
     \[
     c = \frac{333 \, \text{g}}{34.016 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 9.794 \, \text{mol/L}.
     \]

3. **Determine the concentration of H⁺ ions:**
   - For a weak acid, the concentration of H⁺ ions is approximated as:
     \[
     [H^+] = \sqrt{c \cdot K_a}.
     \]
   - Substituting \(c = 9.794 \, \text{mol/L}\) and \(K_a = 1.0 \times 10^{-12}\):
     \[
     [H^+] = \sqrt{9.794 \times 1.0 \times 10^{-12}} \approx \sqrt{9.794 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 3.129 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{mol/L}.
     \]

4. **Calculate the pH:**
   - The pH is given by \(-\log[H^+]\):
     \[
     \text{pH} = -\log(3.129 \times 10^{-6}) \approx -\left(-5.503\right) \approx 5.50.
     \]

5. **Compare with the options:**
   - The closest option to the calculated pH of 5.50 is **C: 5.5**.
