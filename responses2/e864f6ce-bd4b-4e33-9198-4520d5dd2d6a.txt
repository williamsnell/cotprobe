Okay, so I have this question about self-instructional training for impulsive children. Hmm, the question is asking what helps them manage their impulsiveness. Let me think through each option.

First, the question is about self-instructional training, which means the training is done by the child themselves. So the answer should relate to what the child can learn and do on their own.

Option A: Use frequent breaks to manage energy levels. Well, impulsive kids often get stressed and can lose energy easily. Taking breaks might help them stay focused, but is that self-instructional? Or is it a more general approach? Not sure yet.

Option B: Change their self-statements to increase task-oriented behavior. Self-statements are statements made about oneself, like "I'm always too hard on myself." Changing these can make them more focused on the task at hand instead of getting distracted by their own behavior. That sounds like a good approach.

Option C: Incorporate more physical activities. Impulsiveness can be tied to impulsive behavior, maybe like jumping or running when they shouldn't. Adding physical exercises might help them develop better habits, which could reduce impulsiveness.

Option D: Use electronic devices to distract them. Wait, impulsive kids might be more susceptible to electronic distractions because they're often triggered by them. Using devices to distract could actually increase impulsive behavior, so this might not be helpful.

Option E:Suppress impulsive reactions through punishment-based tactics. But impulsive kids might not like punishment, and using it could make them worse off. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Option F: Increase social interactions. More social interactions might help a child become better at managing their impulses, like when they're dealing with a difficult situation, they might talk to others and weigh their options. That sounds positive.

So I'm considering B, C, and F. The question asks what the training should involve. Let's think about what self-instructional training entails. It's about the child's methods, so the training might include techniques they can do on their own.

Changing self-statements (B) could help them focus on tasks. Incorporating physical activities (C) might help them develop better habits, which reduces impulsive behavior. Social interactions (F) could help them learn to manage their emotions in a group setting, which is a good way to manage impulses.

Wait, the question is about the training. So self-instructional training would involve the child's methods to manage their behavior. So the correct answer should be one of these methods that the child can apply themselves.

Option B is about changing self-statements. That's a way to help them become more focused on the task, which is good for task-oriented behavior.

Option F is about increasing social interactions. That could help a child develop better coping mechanisms because they'd be interacting with others and learning to manage their emotions.

Option C is about physical activities. That might help them build better habits, but is it self-instructional? Or more of a general approach?

Alternatively, the question is about self-instructional training, which could involve teaching the child specific strategies. So perhaps the correct answer is B, as it's a direct method to help their behavior.

Another angle: Impulsive behavior is often linked to impulsive self-talk. So changing self-statements (B) would help them become less likely to engage in impulsive self-talk, leading to better behavior.

So I'm leaning towards B as the correct answer.

The self-instructional training of impulsive children involves methods that help them manage their impulsiveness. Among the options, changing their self-statements (B) is a key approach. This helps reduce impulsive self-talk, fostering better task-oriented behavior. 

Answer: B
