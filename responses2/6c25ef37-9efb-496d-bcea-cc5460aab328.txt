Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here. The question is about finding the equation of a tangent line to a curve defined by F(t) = (t² + 1, 2^t) at the point where y equals 4. Hmm, wait, I think I need to find the point on the curve where y is 4, and then find the tangent line at that point.

Let me think. The curve is given parametrically, right? So F(t) gives both x and y in terms of t. So x(t) = t² +1 and y(t) = 2^t. We need to find the value of t where y equals 4. So set y(t) =4 and solve for t.

So 2^t =4. I know that 4 is 2 squared, so 2^t = 2^2. So t must be 2. So t=2 is where y=4.

Then I need to find the corresponding x value. x(t) = t² +1. Plugging in t=2, x = 4+1=5. So the point is (5,4). Got it.

Now, to find the tangent line at this point. That requires finding the derivative of y with respect to x at that point. Since it's a parametric curve, the slope of the tangent is dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt).

So first, let's find dy/dt and dx/dt.

dy/dt is the derivative of y with respect to t. y(t) =2^t. The derivative of 2^t is ln(2) *2^t. So dy/dt = ln(2)*2^t.

Similarly, dx/dt is the derivative of x(t) = t² +1. So dx/dt = 2t.

At t=2, let's compute these derivatives.

dy/dt at t=2 is ln(2)*2^2 = ln(2)*4.

dx/dt at t=2 is 2*2 =4.

So dy/dx = (4 ln 2) /4 = ln 2.

So the slope of the tangent line is ln 2.

Now, the equation of the tangent line at (5,4) with slope ln 2 is y -4 = ln 2 (x -5).

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Let's check each option.

Option A: y –4 =5 ln 2 (x –2) → slope is 5 ln 2, which doesn't match.
Option B: y –4 = ln2 (x –5) → this looks like it's correct.
Option C: y –4 = ln2 (x –2) → same slope but different x-intercept.
Option D: y–4=4(x–5) → slope 4, which is different from our ln 2.
Option E: y–4=4 ln2 (x–2) → slope 4 ln2, which is not right.
Option F: y–4=2 ln2 (x–2) → different slope.
Option G: y–4=4 ln2 (x–2) → same as E, but with 4 ln2.
Option H: y–4=2(x–5) → slope 2, which is wrong.
Option I: y–4=5(x–2) → slope 5, wrong.
Option J: y–4=2(x–2) ln2 → the same as I but order changed, which is the same thing.

So the correct equation is option B.

To find the tangent line to the curve defined by F(t) = (t² + 1, 2^t) at the point where y = 4, we first determine the value of t where y = 4. Since y(t) = 2^t, we have 2^t = 4, which gives t = 2. Substituting t = 2 into x(t), we get x = 2² + 1 = 5. Thus, the point is (5, 4).

Next, we compute the derivatives dy/dt and dx/dt. For y(t) = 2^t, dy/dt = ln(2) * 2^t. For x(t) = t² + 1, dx/dt = 2t. At t = 2, dy/dt = ln(2) * 4 and dx/dt = 4. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line is dy/dx = (4 ln 2) / 4 = ln 2.

Using the point-slope form of the tangent line equation, y - 4 = ln 2 (x - 5), we find that the correct option is B.
