Question:

Which of the following statements about proteolysis is correct?


Options:

A: Proteolysis does not involve enzymatic processes.
B: Proteolysis only occurs in animal cells.
C: All tissue proteins undergo catabolism at more or less the same rate.
D: The rate of tissue protein catabolism is more or less constant throughout the day.
E: Proteolysis can only occur in the presence of light.
F: Proteolysis is the process of protein synthesis, not breakdown.
G: All proteins are catabolised at the exact same time.
H: All proteins that are to be catabolised are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin.
I: Ubiquitin is only attached to proteins that are to be synthesized, not catabolised.
J: Lysosomal enzymes provide the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about proteolysis. Hmm, I remember that proteolysis is the process of breaking down proteins, right? But wait, what exactly does that involve? Oh yeah, it's enzymatic processes. Proteins are made by the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, and when something happens, like stress, they get broken down.

Let me look at the options. Option A says proteolysis doesn't involve enzymatic processes. Wait, that's wrong because proteolysis definitely uses enzymes. So A is incorrect.

Option B claims proteolysis only occurs in animal cells. No, I think it's done by both animal and plant cells. I remember something about bacterial proteolysis too. So B is wrong.

Option C says all tissue proteins undergo catabolism at the same rate. Catabolism is breaking down, but I don't think all are the same. Some might break down faster, like in muscle vs. liver. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Rate is constant. No, I'm pretty sure the rate varies. It depends on things like the protein's size, how quickly it's tagged, and other factors. So D's wrong.

Option E: Occurs with light. I don't think light is a factor here. Proteolysis is usually done in darkness, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Proteolysis is for synthesis, not breakdown. That's not right. Proteolysis is the breakdown, so F is wrong.

Option G: All proteins are broken down at the same time. No, some are more active or have different affinities. So G is incorrect.

Option H: All to be broken down have ubiquitin tags. I remember that ubiquitin tagging is a way to signal for breakdown, but it's not the only way. Many proteins are tagged for degradation (ubiquitination) and others are broken down without. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Ubiquitin is only for synthesis. No, that's opposite. Proteins are synthesized, so ubiquitin would be on them to signal for breakdown. So I is correct.

Option J: Only lysosomal enzymes. No, there are other systems too. Like some bacteria use them, and maybe even some in the endodermatia. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be I.

The correct statement about proteolysis is option I. Proteolysis involves the breakdown of proteins by enzymes, and ubiquitin is a signal for this process. Proteins are typically tagged with ubiquitin to signal their breakdown, and this is not exclusive to lysosomal enzymes.

Answer: I
