Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the future value of an investment. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is about a $1,000 investment with an 8% interest rate compounded annually over 3 years. I need to find out what the future value is and choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, I remember that compound interest is calculated using the formula: FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Since it's compounded annually, n would be 1. So the formula simplifies to FV = P(1 + r)^t. Let me plug in the numbers here.

P is $1,000. The rate r is 8%, which is 0.08 in decimal. The time t is 3 years. Plugging these into the formula: FV = 1000 * (1 + 0.08)^3.

Wait, what's 1 plus 0.08? That's 1.08. So it's 1.08 raised to the power of 3. Let me calculate that. 1.08^3 is... let me think. I remember that 1.08 squared is 1.1664. Then multiplying that by 1.08 again: 1.1664 * 1.08. Let me compute that. 1.1664 * 1.08. Breaking it down: 1 * 1.08 is 1.08, 0.1664 * 1.08. 0.1664 * 1 is 0.1664, times 0.08 is 0.013312. So adding those: 0.1664 + 0.013312 = 0.179712. So total is 1.08 + 0.179712 = 1.259712. So 1.08^3 equals approximately 1.259712.

Now multiply that by $1,000: 1000 * 1.259712 = $1,259.712. Let me round that to two decimal places, so $1,259.71. Looking at the options, option E is 1259.71. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait a second, let me double-check. Maybe I should compute it step by step for each year. For the first year: 1000 * 1.08 = 1080. Second year: 1080 * 1.08. Let's calculate that. 1080 * 1 is 1080, 1080 * 0.08 is 86.4. So 1080 + 86.4 = 1166.4. Third year: 1166.4 * 1.08. Hmm, 1166.4 * 1 is 1,166.4, 0.08 * 1166.4 is 93.312. Adding those gives 1,166.4 + 93.312 = 1,259.712. So yes, same result. So the FV is approximately $1,259.71, which is option E. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the future value of a $1,000 investment with an 8% annual interest rate compounded annually over 3 years, we use the compound interest formula:

\[ FV = P \times (1 + r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P = 1000 \)
- \( r = 0.08 \)
- \( t = 3 \)

Plugging in the values:

\[ FV = 1000 \times (1 + 0.08)^3 = 1000 \times (1.08)^3 \]

Calculating \( 1.08^3 \):

\[ 1.08 \times 1.08 = 1.1664 \]
\[ 1.1664 \times 1.08 = 1.259712 \]

Thus:

\[ FV = 1000 \times 1.259712 = 1259.712 \]

Rounded to two decimal places, the future value is approximately $1,259.71. 

**Answer:** E: 1259.71
