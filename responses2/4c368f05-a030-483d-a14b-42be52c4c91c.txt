Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining which proposition is an immediate consequence in propositional logic from the given premises. Let me read the premises first.

The premises are:
1. (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D)
2. A ∨ B
3. ~C

And the options are A to H, each a different proposition. I need to find which one is a direct consequence of these premises.

Hmm, I remember that in logic, when we have implications, if the premise is true, the conclusion can follow. So I should probably use some rules of inference here, like modus ponens or hypothetical syllogism.

Let me first break down the premises. The first premise is (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D). So if either A or B is true, then either C or D must be true. The second premise is A ∨ B, which means at least one of A or B is true. The third premise is ~C, meaning C is false.

Since A ∨ B is true, according to the first premise, (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D) must hold. But since the premise is (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D), and we know that (A ∨ B) is true, then (C ∨ D) must also be true. Wait, but the third premise says ~C, so if C is false, then for (C ∨ D) to be true, D must be true because C is false. So D is true.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see D directly. Let me look at the options again. Option A is C ∨ D. But since C is false, D needs to be true for this to be true. So option A would require D to be true, which we just deduced from the premises. So A is C ∨ D. Since both C and D can't be true (C is false, but D is true), the disjunction C ∨ D is true. So option A is true.

Option B is (A ∨ B) → ~D. Wait, but from the premises, we've deduced that D is true, so ~D is false. So (A ∨ B) is true (from premise 2), and the implication (true) → false would be false. So option B is not necessarily true.

Option C: (A ∨ B) → ~~C. Well, ~C is given, so ~~C is C. But (A ∨ B) is true, so the implication would be true only if the conclusion is true. But C is false, so this whole implication is false because the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So C is false.

Option D: D ∨ ~C. Since D is true and ~C is true (because C is false), the disjunction is true. So D ∨ ~C is true.

Option E: ~~D. Well, double negation is the same as D. Since we know D is true, ~~D is also true. So E is true.

Option F: ~A ∨ ~B. We know from premise 2 that A ∨ B is true, so the negation of (A ∨ B) is false. But ~A ∨ ~B is the same as ~ (A ∧ B). Since A ∨ B is true, ~ (A ∧ B) is also true. So F is true.

Option G: B ∨ ~A. Hmm, that's the negation of (A ∧ B). If both A and B were true, this would be false. But since A ∨ B is true, either A or B is true, so the negation is false. So G is false.

Option H: ~D ∨ C. Since D is true, ~D is false. But C is false, so the disjunction is false. So H is false.

Option I: ~~C. As before, ~~C is C, which is false. So I is false.

So let's recap the options:

A: C ∨ D → True
B: (A∨B)→~D → False, since D is true, so ~D is false, making the implication False.
C: (A∨B)→~~C → False, since ~C is true but (A∨B)→True, so implication is True only if conclusion is True. Here, the conclusion is ~C, which is True. So implication is True only if conclusion is True. So (A∨B) is True, and conclusion is True, so implication is True. Wait, but wait: implication is True if the premise is True and conclusion is True. Wait, no. The implication is ( premise ) → ( conclusion ). So if premise is true, and conclusion is true, the implication is true. But in option C, the conclusion is ~~C, which is C. So when C is false, then the conclusion is false. So the implication is (A∨B) → (C). Since (A∨B) is true and C is false, the implication is False. So option C is False.

Wait, I might have gotten confused earlier. Let me double-check:

Option C is (A∨B) → ~~C. Since ~C is given, (A∨B) → (True). So the implication is True if (A∨B) is true, which it is. So option C is True.

Wait, no—wait. Let me clarify: the premises are (A∨B) → (C∨D), (A∨B), and ~C. So from these, we can derive D. Because (A∨B) → (C∨D) is True, and (A∨B) is True, so (C∨D) must be True. But since ~C is given ( premise 3 ), that makes (C∨D) True only if D is True. So D must be True.

So let me re-examine the options.

Option A: C∨D. Since C is false and D is true, C∨D is true. So A is True.

Option B: (A∨B)→~D. (A∨B) is True, and D is True, so ~D is False. So True → False is False. So B is False.

Option C: (A∨B) → ~~C. Since ~C is True, (A∨B)→True is True, so C is True.

Option D: D ∨ ~C. D is True, so regardless of ~C, the OR is True. So D is True, so D ∨ anything is True. So D is True.

Option E: ~~D. Which is D. But D is True, so E is True.

Option F: ~A ∨ ~B. Since A∨B is True, either A or B is True. So ~A and ~B can't both be True. So at least one of them is False. So ~A ∨ ~B is True because at least one is False. So F is True.

Option G: B ∨ ~A. Well, since A∨B is True, either A is True or B is True. So if A is True, ~A is False, but B is True, so B ∨ ~A is True. If A is False, then B is True, so B ∨ ~A is True. So G is True.

Option H: ~D ∨ C. D is True, so ~D is False. But C is False, so False ∨ False is False. So H is False.

Option I: ~~C. Which is C. C is False, so I is False.

So which propositions are true?

Looking at the options, A, C, D, E, F are True.

But wait, the question is asking for the immediate consequence. So from the premises, what can be directly concluded?

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the premises are (A∨B)→(C∨D), (A∨B), and ~C. So from (A∨B)→(C∨D) and (A∨B), we can infer (C∨D). Then, from (C∨D) and ~C, we can infer D (since if C is false, D must be true for C∨D to be true). So that gives us D.

Now, looking back at the options, which of the options is a consequence of the premises.

So looking at the options, let's see which ones are true:

Option A: C∨D → True (since D is true, so C∨D is true).

Option C: (A∨B)→~~C. But ~C is given, so (A∨B)→True is True. So C is True.

Option D: D ∨ ~C → True since D is true.

Option E: ~~D → D, which is true as D is true.

Wait, but the options are all individual propositions. So which of these propositions is a consequence of the premises.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following propositions is an immediate consequence in PL of the given premises." So I need to find which of the options is a logical consequence.

But perhaps I should consider each option as a possible conclusion.

Wait, but in the premises, from (A∨B)→(C∨D) and (A∨B), and ~C, I can derive D.

So D is a conclusion, but looking at the options, which one is D? Let me check the options:

Looking at the options, D is D ∨ ~C. So D ∨ ~C is True (since D is True), so D ∨ ~C is equivalent to D, which is True. So D ∨ ~C (option D) is True.

But wait, let me check. If I have (A∨B)→(C∨D), (A∨B), and ~C, then D must be true. So D is a conclusion.

So which options are true.

Option A: C∨D → True.

Option D: D ∨ ~C → D ∨ False (since ~C is False) → D → True.

Option E: ~~D → D → True.

Option F: ~A ∨ ~B → Since A∨B is True, either A or B is True. So if A is True, ~B is False, but if B is True, ~A is False. Either way, at least one is False, so ~A ∨ ~B is True.

So all options A, D, E, F are True. But wait, the question is asking for the immediate consequence, which is one-step.

Wait, but the problem is that I'm trying to find which of the options is a consequence of the premises. So perhaps only one of them is a consequence.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, from the premises, we can derive D. So which of the options is D?

Looking at the options, option D is D ∨ ~C. Since D is true, D ∨ anything is true, including ~C (which is false). So D ∨ ~C is true. So option D is a consequence.

But let me check other options. For example, option E is ~~D → D. Since ~D is the negation of D, so ~~D is D. So E is D → D, which is True.

So options A, D, E, F are True. But the question says "immediate consequence in PL of the given premises." So which of these is correct.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether it's one of them or which one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but another approach: using the premises, can we derive each option?

Let me check each option:

Option A: C∨D. Since D is true, C∨D is true.

Option B: (A∨B)→~D. Since D is true, ~D is false. So implication is false.

Option C: (A∨B)→~~C. Since ~C is true (as premise 3), the implication is True.

Option D: D ∨ ~C. Since D is true, this is true.

Option E: ~~D → D. Since ~D is false, ~~D is D. So implication is D→D, which is True.

Option F: ~A ∨ ~B. Since A∨B is True, at least one is True, so this is True.

Option G: B ∨ ~A. Since A∨B is True, this is True.

Option H: ~D ∨ C. Since D is true, ~D is false, and C is false. So False ∨ False = False.

Option I: ~~C. Since premise 3 is ~C, which is true, so ~~C is C, which is false. So this is false.

So which options are correct based on the premises?

So options A, C, D, E, F are True, and G, H, I are False.

But the question is asking for the proposition that is an immediate consequence, so which of these is a consequence of the premises.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider first which of the options logically follows.

Wait, the premises allow us to derive D, so any option that is a logical consequence of D would be correct.

Looking at the options, which of them is equivalent to D.

Option D is D ∨ ~C. Since D is true, this simplifies to D. So option D is equivalent to D, which is a consequence of the premises.

Similarly, option E is ~~D → D, which simplifies to D → D, which is a tautology and always true.

Option A is C∨D, which is true because D is true.

Option F is ~A ∨ ~B. Since A∨B is true, at least one of A or B is true, so their negations are both false. So F is false.

Wait, no. Wait, F is ~A ∨ ~B. If A is true, ~A is false. If B is true, ~B is false. If both are false? No, because A∨B is true, so at least one is true, meaning both can't be false. So F is always true.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider each option and see if it's a logical consequence.

Alternative approach:

We can derive D from the premises. So D is a consequence. So any option that is a logical consequence of D would be correct.

Looking at the options, which are consequences of D.

Option A: C∨D → True because D is true.

Option D: D ∨ ~C → True because D is true.

Option E: ~~D → D → True.

Option F: ~A ∨ ~B → True, since A∨B is true.

Option G: B ∨ ~A → True, since A∨B is true.

Option H: ~D ∨ C → False, because D is true, so ~D is false, and C is false. So Falsity.

Option I: ~~C → C → False, as premise 3 is ~C, so C is false.

So which options are correct? A, D, E, F, G, H, I. Only A, D, E, F are correct? But the question is about the immediate consequence, so which of the options is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which is an immediate consequence. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: Using the premises, can we derive each option?

Option A: C∨D. Since D is true, C∨D is true.

Option B: (A∨B)→~D. Since D is true, ~D is false. So implication is false.

Option C: (A∨B)→~~C. Since ~C is true, implication is true.

Option D: D ∨ ~C. Since D is true, D∨anything is true.

Option E: ~~D → D. Since ~D is false, the implication is true.

Option F: ~A ∨ ~B. Since A∨B is true, at least one of them is true, so their negations are both false. So F is false.

Wait, no. Wait, A∨B is true, so either A is true or B is true. So if A is true, ~A is false, but ~B is true. So F is True because at least one is negated.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If A is true, F becomes False ∨ True → True. If A is false and B is true, F becomes True ∨ False → True. So F is always True.

So Option F is True.

So the options that are True are A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I except for I, which is false.

But the question is about the immediate consequence. So which of these options is a consequence of the premises.

Wait, but the premises already allow us to derive D. So any option that is equivalent to D or a logical consequence of D.

Looking at the options, which options are true when D is true.

Option D: D ∨ ~C is True because D is true.

Option E: ~~D → D is True because D is true.

Option A: C∨D is True (since D is true).

Option F: ~A ∨ ~B is True because A∨B is true, so at least one is true.

Option G: B ∨ ~A is True.

Option H: ~D ∨ C is False because D is true, so ~D is false, and C is false.

Option I: ~~C is False because premise 3 is ~C.

So, the options that are true are A, C, D, E, F, G, H (but H is false), I (false). So the options that are consequences are A, C, D, E, F.

Wait, but the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence. So maybe the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the correct answer is D.

To determine the immediate consequence of the premises, we analyze each option:

1. **Premises**:  
   - (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D)  
   - A ∨ B  
   - ~C  

2. **Derivation**:  
   From (A ∨ B) → (C ∨ D) and (A ∨ B), we can infer (C ∨ D). Given ~C, we conclude D (since C is false, D must be true for (C ∨ D) to hold).

3. **Evaluating Options**:  
   Each option is evaluated to see if it is a logical consequence of the premises:
   - **A: C ∨ D** → True (D is true).  
   - **B: (A ∨ B) → ~D** → False (D is true, so ~D is false).  
   - **C: (A ∨ B) → ~~C** → True ( ~C is true).  
   - **D: D ∨ ~C** → True (D is true).  
   - **E: ~~D → D** → True ( ~D is false, so ~~D is D).  
   - **F: ~A ∨ ~B** → True (If A ∨ B is true, at least one is true, so their negations are both false).  
   - **G: B ∨ ~A** → True (If A ∨ B is true, at least one is true, so their negations are both false).  
   - **H: ~D ∨ C** → False (D is true, so ~D is false, and C is false).  
   - **I: ~~C** → False (Premise 3 states ~C, which is true).  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The immediate consequence is **D: D ∨ ~C**, as D is true and ~C is false, making the disjunction true.
