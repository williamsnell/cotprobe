Question:

Discuss Murray's theory of motivation and what influence it had on McClelland's development of the Achievement Motivation model.

Options:

A: McClelland's model was influenced by Hull's theory of survival instincts
B: McClelland's model expanded on Murray's theory by introducing the idea that motivation is primarily driven by social comparison, which wasn't a focus in Murray's work.
C: Murray's theory had no influence on McClelland's model
D: McClelland's model was a direct copy of Murray's ideas
E: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's theory of motivation that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives, and that anything leading to positive affect produces approach behavior and anything leading to negative affect produces avoidance behavior.
F: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's emphasis on psychosocial stages of development, which is not actually a part of Murray's theory.
G: McClelland's model disregarded Murray's focus on individual needs and instead proposed that environmental factors are the only determinants of human motivation.
H: McClelland's model was based on the premise that motivation is solely a product of external rewards and punishments, without any influence from Murray's theory.
I: McClelland's model was influenced by Murray's hierarchy of needs, which is a confusion with Maslow's theory, not Murray's.
J: Murray's theory suggested that motivation is derived from subconscious sexual and aggressive drives, which McClelland incorporated directly into his model.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about motivation theories. The question is about how Murray's theory influenced McClelland's model of achievement motivation. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that both theories are important in psychology, especially in the field of human motivation. So, I need to recall what each theory says.

Murray's theory, I think, is about how people derive motivation from their internal needs, like self respect, self-efficacy, and self-evaluation. He proposed that people are motivated by the sense of self that they have, which could be from their own achievements, fears, or fears of being judged negatively. So, his model focuses more on individual psychological needs rather than external factors like rewards or punishments.

On the other hand, McClelland's model is called the Big Five, which includes five factors: Need for Closure, Need for Security, Need for Affinity, Need for Power, and Need for Self-Direction. Each of these is an internal need that drives people to seek out certain outcomes. So his model emphasizes these internal needs as the primary drivers of motivation.

The options given are A to J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: McCleland's model was influenced by Hull's survival instinct. I don't think so. Hull's survival instinct is more about survival needs, like survival, which is different from motivation. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: McCleland expanded on Murray's theory by introducing social comparison. Hmm. I'm not sure. I thought that Murray focused on individual needs, not social comparison. Maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: Murray's theory had no influence on McCleland's model. That doesn't make sense. I think there was some overlap, but I don't remember exactly.

Option D: McCleland copied Murray's ideas. That sounds wrong. I don't think he was directly copying; his model is distinct, especially in its structure.

Option E: McCleland was influenced by Murray's idea that human behavior is influenced by needs and motives. That seems right. The paragraph in option E says that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives, and positive affect leads to approach, negative to avoidance. That aligns with what I know about McCleland's model. He said that people drive behavior based on their needs, so his model was influenced by the idea that behavior is shaped by these needs.

Option F: Influenced by Murray's psychosocial theory. But psychosocial theory is about development stages, not motivation. I don't think E is correct because psychosocial factors are a later concept. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: McCleland disregarded individual needs and incorporated environmental factors. No, that's opposite. He included individual needs as the primary drivers.

Option H: Influenced by Murray's hierarchy of needs. Wait, the question is about whether McCleland's model was influenced by Murray's theory. The options say "influenced by Murray's theory," so if H is saying that, that would be incorrect because H says it's a confusion with Maslow's theory. I think there was confusion between the two theories, but H is not correct. So H is wrong.

Option I: Influenced by Murray's hierarchy theory. Again, that's incorrect because McCleland's model isn't based on that. It's different, so I is wrong.

Option J: Influenced by Murray's idea about psychological drives. Yes, J says that Murray suggested that motivation is from psychological drives like sexual and aggressive drives, and McCleland incorporated that into his model. I remember that in his model, people are motivated by their needs, which include things like self-respect and self-efficacy, but also internal factors like sexual drives. So J is correct. So J's statement matches what I know.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is about which option is correct. The options are A-J, and the question is which influence occurred.

So, the correct answer would be E and J. But wait, the options are separate. The question is asking which option is correct. So looking at the options:

E says thatMcCleland's model was influenced by Murray's theory that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives.

J says that Murray's theory suggested that motivation is from subconscious drives, which McCleland incorporated into his model.

So both E and J are correct statements. But let me check the options.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, and each option is a separate statement. So the question is asking which statement is correct, and the options are A to J, each presenting a possible correct statement.

Wait, the question is "what influence it had on McClelland's development of the Achievement Motivation model." So, which of the options correctly describes that influence.

So looking again at the options:

Option E and J both seem correct, but let's see. E says that McCleland's model was influenced by Murray's theory that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives. That's correct.

Option J states that Murray's theory suggested that motivation is from psychological drives, which McCleland incorporated. That's also correct.

But the options are presented as separate, so which one is correct?

Wait, the original question says, "which influence it had on..." So I think both E and J are correct, but looking at the options, they are each presented as separate options.

Wait, but in the options given, only one can be correct. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is about which option is correct. So let's go through each option.

Option E: Correct. Because it's about how McCleland's model was influenced by Murray's theory.

Option J: Correct. Because it's about the idea that Murray's theory led to the incorporation of psychological drives into McCleland's model.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the influence on McCleland's model, so which of the statements is correct.

Wait, the question is: What influence did Murray's theory have on McCleland's model?

So, the influence is that McCleland's model was influenced by Murray's theory that behavior is influenced by individual needs and motives.

So, option E is correct. Option J is about the content of Murray's theory, not the influence on McCleland's model.

Wait, but let me re-examine the options. The options are:

E: Influenced by Murray's theory that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives.

J: Influenced by Murray's theory that motivation is derived from psychological drives, which McCleland incorporated into his model.

So, both E and J are correct statements. But the options are presented as mutually exclusive options. Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, each being a possible statement.

Wait, but in reality, both E and J are correct. But looking at the options, I'm to choose one as the correct answer. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, each option is a possible answer. So, the question is, which of the options is correct.

If both E and J are correct, but the options are presented as separate, maybe only one is correct. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the question is about the influence of Murray's theory on McCleland's model.

So, option E is about the influence on the model. Option J is about the content. So the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps only one option is correct. Let me think about what each option says.

The question is about the influence (i.e., what was the result of the theory being applied by someone else). So, which option describes the effect that Murray's theory had on McCleland.

Option E says that the model was influenced by Murray's theory. Option J says that the theory influenced the model's content.

So, the question is about the influence, so the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but earlier I thought that J was correct as well. So perhaps only E is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express the options.

E: The model was influenced by Murray's theory that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives.

J: The model was influenced by Murray's theory that motivation is from psychological drives, which McCleland included.

So, both E and J are correct statements, but the question is about the influence. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the theories again.

McClureland's model is known for its focus on individual needs. It includes things like self-efficacy, self-respect, etc. These are psychological needs. So, the idea that human behavior is influenced by individual needs and motives (from Murray) would have influenced the model.

Therefore, option E is correct.

However, another possibility: perhaps option J is correct because it's about the specific content of Murray's theory. But the question is about the influence, not the exact content.

So, the correct answer is E.
</think>

The question asks about the influence of Murray's theory on McClelland's theory of motivation, specifically the Achievement Motivation model. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Murray's theory does not emphasize survival instincts; it focuses on individual psychological needs.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Murray's theory emphasizes individual needs, not social comparison.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. There was a significant overlap between their theories.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. McCleland's model is distinct, not a direct copy of Murray's ideas.
- **Option E**: Correct. Murray's theory influenced McCleland's model by proposing that behavior is shaped by individual needs and motives.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Psychosocial factors are not part of Murray's theory.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. McCleland's model does not disregard individual needs; it includes them.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. There was confusion with Maslow's theory, not Murray's.
- **Option J**: Correct. Murray's theory suggested motivation arises from psychological drives, which McCleland incorporated into his model.

The question specifically asks about the influence of Murray's theory on McCleland's model, so the correct answer is **Option E**, as it directly addresses the impact of Murray's theory on McCleland's work.
