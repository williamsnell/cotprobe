Question:

Which of the following statements about human amino acid requirements in human nutrition is correct?


Options:

A: The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages.
B: The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages.
C: The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children.
D: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.

Okay, so I've got this question about human amino acid requirements in nutrition. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives four options, A to D, each making a statement about how amino acid requirements are determined. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, right? And the body's needs depend on how much protein is being consumed. So, the way the body calculates what proteins an individual needs to consume is based on their consumption of amino acids. But here, the question is about the patterns of these requirements.

Option A says that the adult-based requirement is assumed for all ages. Wait, I remember that when adults are eating, their body needs to account for their age, which affects metabolism. For example, older adults might need more amino acids because their bodies burn more calories, so more energy is needed. But the basic requirement for成人 is based on their age, but does it apply to all ages? I'm not sure. Maybe option A is incorrect because it's assuming that the same adult requirements apply to younger people. I think that's not right because younger individuals have different energy needs.

Option B claims it's the maintenance for all ages. Maintenance refers to the basic needs without considering activity levels. So, if someone is resting, they might not need as much as someone who's active. But would the adult's requirement apply to both? I'm not certain. Maybe B is wrong.

Option C suggests breast milk's amino acid pattern is for all children. Wait, breast milk is specifically for infants and young children. So if the body's requirements for breast milk are determined based on the baby's body, does that mean the same pattern applies to all children? Or is it that the pattern was determined specifically for the baby, not all children? I think the standard assumption is that the same pattern applies to all children, so that's probably correct. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should think about it more.

Option D states that human tissue protein's amino acid pattern is for infants and young children. Tissue proteins are typically given to infants, but I'm not sure how their amino acid needs are determined. I thought that the standard for infants is to have tissue protein given to them, but the amino acid content is usually lower. So does the pattern for this apply to all young children, or is it specific to infants? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe D is incorrect because it's not for all children; perhaps it's only for infants.

Wait, let's think about the options again. Let's break down each statement.

Option A:成人需求适用于所有年龄。I think this isn't correct because older adults require more because metabolism is higher. So, the same pattern would not apply to all ages. So A is incorrect.

Option B:成人需求是维持性的，适用于所有年龄。Again, maintenance doesn't account for activity levels. So if someone is resting, their maintenance would be less than someone who's active. But does the adult's need apply to both? Or would the pattern be different based on activity? I'm not sure. Maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: breast milk's amino acid pattern for all children. Since breast milk is given to infants, their requirements are determined based on their body. So does that mean all children would have the same pattern? Or is it that it's the standard pattern for all children? I think the standard is that the same pattern applies to all children, so C is correct.

Option D: tissue protein's pattern for all young children. Wait, I think that the standard is to give tissue protein to infants, but the amount and type of amino acids vary. So the pattern isn't the same for all young children. It's more specific to infants. So D is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question is about which statement is correct. So looking for the best option.

Option C says the breast milk's amino acid pattern is for all children. That's probably correct because breast milk is given to all infants, and the standard pattern is determined based on the baby's metabolism, so it's applicable to all children.

Option D talks about human tissue protein. I think tissue proteins are given to infants, but their amino acid requirement is determined based on the baby's needs. So the pattern is specific to infants, not all children. Therefore, D is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option C, because breast milk's amino acid requirement is the same for all children.

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option based on the principles of human nutrition:

- **Option A**: The statement claims that adult-based amino acid requirements apply to all ages. However, older adults consume more energy and thus require more amino acids due to higher metabolic demands. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This option suggests that adult requirements are maintenance patterns applicable to all ages. Maintenance refers to basic needs without considering activity levels, which vary among individuals. Thus, this statement is also incorrect.

- **Option C**: The amino acid pattern in breast milk is determined based on the baby's metabolism, making it suitable for all children. This statement aligns with the understanding that breast milk is given to all infants and young children, and the standard pattern is applicable to all children. Hence, this is correct.

- **Option D**: Human tissue protein is given to infants, but the amino acid requirement is determined based on the baby's needs. This makes the pattern specific to infants, not all young children. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

The correct answer is **C**, as the amino acid pattern in breast milk is applicable to all children.

**Answer: C**
