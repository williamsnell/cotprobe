Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a gas expanding in a gas engine. Let me read it again. The piston moves, and the gas does 2000 ft-lb of work at a constant pressure of 3000 lb/sq ft. I need to find how much the volume changes. The options are A to J, with various cubic feet values.

Hmm, I remember that work done by a gas is related to pressure and volume change. Oh right, the formula for work when the pressure is constant is W = PΔV. Wait, no, wait—actually, I think that's when pressure is constant, work done is pressure times change in volume. But wait, the volume here is the change, right? Because the piston moves, so the volume decreases or increases, depending on the direction.

Wait, in a gas engine, the piston moves, so the volume must be changing. If the work done is 2000 ft·lb, and the pressure is 3000 lb/ft², then I can plug into W = PΔV. So W is 2000, P is 3000, so ΔV is W/P. Let me calculate that: 2000 divided by 3000 is 2/3. So ΔV is 2/3 ft³. Wait, but wait a second. The units here are a bit tricky. Let me make sure.

In the problem, work is given in foot-pounds. I remember that 1 foot-pound is equal to 1 pound times 1 foot. So when pressure is in lb/ft², it's equivalent to lb per square foot. So when I multiply pressure (lb/ft²) by volume (ft³), I get ft·lb, which matches the unit of work. So yes, the formula should work.

So ΔV is 2000 / 3000 = 2/3 ft³. But wait, the piston moves, so is volume increasing or decreasing? Well, in a gas engine, when the piston moves, the volume typically decreases. Because as the piston moves inward, the volume of the gas inside the cylinder decreases. So, if the work is done by the gas, then the volume must have decreased. So ΔV would be negative, but since the question asks for the magnitude, the change in volume is 2/3 ft³.

Looking at the options, option E is (2/3) ft³. So the correct answer should be E.

Another angle: volume change is ΔV = V_final - V_initial. Work done is P*(V_final - V_initial) because pressure is constant. So 2000 = 3000*(V_final - V_initial). So (V_final - V_initial) = 2000/3000 = 2/3. So yes, that's the volume change. So answer is E.

The work done by the gas is given as 2000 ft·lb, and the constant pressure is 3000 lb/ft². Using the formula for work done at constant pressure, \( W = P \Delta V \), we solve for \( \Delta V \):

\[
\Delta V = \frac{W}{P} = \frac{2000 \, \text{ft·lb}}{3000 \, \text{lb/ft}^2} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{ft}^3.
\]

Since the piston moves, the volume decreases. Therefore, the volume change is \( \frac{2}{3} \, \text{ft}^3 \). The correct answer is:

**E: (2/3) ft³**
