Alright, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about outliers. I need to figure out which option correctly defines an outlier. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question asks, "An outlier is an observation that..." and then it gives several options. I remember that an outlier is a data point that's significantly different from other observations. Let me go through each option.

Option A says it's the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. That doesn't sound right because the outlier isn't necessarily the mode. The mode is just a single value, whereas an outlier could be any value, but it's not always the mode. So A is out.

Option B: Mean. The mean is the average, so an outlier doesn't have to be the mean. It can be anything, but the mean is just a measure. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Seen more frequently. Well, if something's seen more frequently, it's the mode. But we already ruled out A as the mode. So C is the same as A, which we don't consider correct.

Option D: Always larger. That's not necessarily true. An outlier could be either larger or smaller. It depends on what the other data points are. So D is not correct.

Option E: Always smaller. Similar to D, it doesn't have to be always smaller. So E is out.

Option F: Seen less frequently. Again, this refers to the frequency, which again is the mode. So F is the same as C, which we've already considered and ruled out.

Option G: Significantly different. This seems to fit. An outlier is a data point that's significantly different from the others, meaning it's either very high or very low compared to the rest. So G sounds correct.

Option H: An error in the data set. Hmm, errors can cause outliers, but the definition is that an outlier is an observation, not necessarily due to an error. So H might not be the best answer. Maybe it's not the definition but a cause. Wait, the question is about what the outlier is, not why it's there. So H is about the error, not the definition.

Option I: Median. The median is the middle value. An outlier doesn't have to be the median. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Exactly the same. If it's exactly the same as others, it's not an outlier. So J is wrong.

So the only option that makes sense is G: is seen more frequently than the other observations in the data set. Because if an observation is seen more often, it's the mode. But wait, the definition of outlier isn't about frequency but about being significantly different. Wait, did I get that right?

Wait, sometimes people confuse outliers with modes. For example, sometimes a data set can have multiple modes, but that's not the definition of an outlier. An outlier is defined as a value that is significantly different from the rest, meaning it's an outlier, not the mode.

Wait, no. Wait, another thought: an outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the rest. So the definition is about being significantly different, not about frequency. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but wait. The options are:

G: significantly different.

Is that the correct definition? Let me think: yes, because the outlier is a data point that is significantly different from others. So G is correct.

So the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: is seen more frequently than the other observations in the data set. This option refers to the mode, but the definition of an outlier is about being significantly different, not about frequency. Therefore, G is the correct choice.

Answer: G
