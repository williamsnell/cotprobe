Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the excerpts below.
This corruption is repeatedly designated by Paul by the term sin . . . such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture . . . we are, merely on account of such corruption, deservedly condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 2: Chapter 1, 1545
The covenant of life is not preached equally to all, and among those to whom it is preached, does not always meet with the same reception. This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.
—John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545

Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which justification Calvin used in the given context. Let's see. The question is about which justification from the options A to J is correct based on the passages provided.

First, I'll read the passages carefully. The first excerpt is from John Calvin's "The Institutes of Christian Religion," Book 2, Chapter 1545. It talks about corruption and sin, using terms like adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, etc. It also mentions that these sin fruits are to be condemned by God, but only those who are righteous receive it.

The second excerpt is from the same book, Book 3, Chapter 21, 1545. This one discusses Calvin's view on the covenant of life. It says that this covenant isn't equally preachable to everyone and that there's a diversity in reception. Calvin points out that this diversity shows unsearchable depth and is subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. If salvation is given spontaneously to some, others can't access it, leading to questions about election and predestination.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with Calvin's reasoning. Let's go through each option.

A: Everyone has direct access to God without priests or church hierarchy. Calvin doesn't mention priests here, so I don't think this is it.

B: Separation of church and state. Calvin does discuss the separation of church and state but not the separation of individuals. So maybe not B.

C: Religious tolerance and acceptance of different faiths. Calvin talks about the diversity in the covenant but doesn't mention acceptance of different faiths. So probably not C.

D: Religion used to challenge the authority of monarchs. Calvin mentions God using His grace to do that, but I don't think this is the justification he uses in the context.

E: Corruption of the Roman Catholic Church. Calvin's context is about the Catholic Church, but the passage doesn't specifically state this corruption; it's more about the effect of sin. So maybe E isn't directly applicable unless he's talking about the Church's issues, which isn't the main point here.

F: Church subordinate to state. Calvin does discuss the separation of church and state but not the state's role in governance. So F might not be the correct choice.

G: salvation is predetermined. The passage says God doesn't accept all; some get it spontaneously. Wait, Calvin said that not all have access. But wait, in the first passage, it's mentioned that those to whom sin is preached don't always receive the same. So in the second passage, he also talks about some having access and others not. So in the context, Calvin argues that salvation isn't given to everyone, but only those who are righteous. So G says "save... without good works is supported." Wait, that's more about the afterlife. Calvin's main point is about the spontaneous acceptance, not that salvation is predestined.

H: Churches should self-govern. Calvin talks about the structure of the covenant, but I don't remember it stating that churches should self-govern. So H isn't the correct one.

I: Religious teachings in vernacular. No, Calvin's approach is mainly in Latin, so I think this isn't it.

J: salvation from faith alone. The first passage says God does not accept all, but only those who are righteous. So Calvin doesn't believe that all individuals have access, which is J's belief. But wait, in the first passage, it's about those to whom sin is taught who don't always receive the same. So when Calvin says "those to whom it is preach'd..." don't always receive. So J's idea is that salvation is from faith, but Calvin is saying that it's not universal.

Wait, so looking back. The question is which justification is used by Calvin. The first passage is about sin and the fruits of sin being condemned. The second passage is about the covenant of life being not equally accessible and leading to questions about election and predestination.

The question is about the justification used by Calvin. The second passage's main point is that salvation is not available to all, only those who are righteous. So Calvin argues that not all have access, and that's part of the justification. But wait, the options don't directly mention that.

Looking again, option G says "Religion was used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs." That's about the Bible's role in governance, but I don't think that's Calvin's justification. 

Option D says "Religion used to challenge the authority of monarchs." Calvin's argument isn't about that. 

Wait, maybe I should think of Calvin's main points. He's talking about the covenant in the second passage. So he's saying that the covenant isn't equally given to all, so some are given and others aren't. So he's making a point that not all are given, but he's not giving a justification for that. 

But wait, the question is which justification was used. From the passages, the key point is that some are given and others aren't. So the idea that some are given and others aren't is a principle that Calvin is highlighting as a justification. So which option relates to that?

Looking at the options, option G is about salvation being predestined. Calvin says that God doesn't accept all, but some are given. So he doesn't believe that salvation is predestined for everyone. Therefore, option G is not correct.

Wait, but the question is about which justification is used. The second passage talks about the diversity, which is about whether all can be given. So perhaps Calvin is using that diversity as a justification. But in the options, it's not an option here.

Wait, looking at the options, the only one that relates to the idea of some being accessible is option G, but that's the one that says "save... without good works is supported." No, that's about God's judgment, not about access.

Wait, the question is which justification is used by Calvin. Let me re-read the passages.

First passage: "the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture." So it's not about personal access but about the nature of sin's effects.

Second passage: "they believe that salvation is not given to all..." No, that's Calvin's belief. He says that not all are given. But he doesn't justify it.

Wait, the question is about which justification is used by Calvin. The options given are all possible justifications he used.

Wait, perhaps looking for Calvin's argument that not all are given. The second passage is about the variety in the covenant and the lack of universal access. So when that happens, Calvin is trying to justify why some are given. So perhaps the idea that some are given is a justification, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is about the second passage's point. It says, "gcd is not preachable equally to all," so perhaps the idea that not all can be received is a justification. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options don't have that. So maybe I need to see which option is correct based on the passages.

The first passage: "such as adultery, fornication, theft, hatred, murder, revellings, he terms, in the same way, the fruits of sin." So sin's fruits are condemned, but only those who are righteous get it.

The second passage: "they believe that salvation is not given to all..." So Calvin believes that not all have access.

Which of the options reflects that?

Looking back, the options are:

A: Everyone has access without priests.

B: Separation of church from state.

C: Acceptance of different faiths.

D: Relig. challenges monarchs.

E: Roman Catholic Church corruption.

F: Church subordinate to state.

G: salvation predestined.

H: Churches self-govern.

I: Teach in vernacular.

J: Faith only.

So the correct answer must be G. But I thought Calvin doesn't believe that salvation is predestined. He says that God doesn't accept all, but some are given.

Wait, the second passage says that "some" are given. So Calvin's belief is that not all are given. So the idea that not all are given is a justification. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are the given statements. So the correct answer must be option G because it's a point that Calvin makes. But wait, the second passage says that the covenant isn't given equally, and that some are given. So Calvin is saying that some are given, which is a point he uses.

But the options are:

G: The idea that salvation is predetermined and not all individuals have access to it.

Wait, Calvin's belief is that God doesn't accept all, but he doesn't say that salvation is predetermined. So G is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the second passage's point. The second passage says that the covenant isn't equally given to all, which is a point of his own. So when Calvin says that, it's about the diversity, which doesn't directly correspond to any option except perhaps G is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the first passage. The first passage talks about the fruits of sin being condemned. But that's about the nature of sin, not a justification.

Wait, the question is which justification was used by Calvin. The second passage is about the diversity in the covenant, which is a point he uses.

Wait, the options don't have a point that directly matches that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says, "which of the following justifications used by Calvin..." and the options are statements. So the options are about Calvin's reasoning.

Looking again at the passages:

First passage: "the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture. . . we are [...] condemned by God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousness, innocence, and purity."

So the key point is that not all are acceptable. So when Calvin says that's he's saying that only those who are righteous are given salvation. So the idea that not all are given.

Looking at the options, the closest would be G: "The idea that salvation is predetermined and not all individuals have access to it." But wait, Calvin's belief isn't that salvation is predestined but that it's not given to all. So G isn't correct.

Wait, the only other option related to the first passage is that of the first option, but that's about access.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G because it's the only one that directly relates to Calvin's point in the second passage. Or perhaps I'm mixing up.

Wait, maybe the answer is option G. Because the second passage discusses the diversity in the covenant, which relates to the idea that not all are given. But I'm not sure if that's the justification. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because Calvin's view is that salvation is not predestined but is given with some conditions, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G because in the second passage, Calvin is emphasizing that the covenant isn't equally given to all, which is a point he uses as a justification. So perhaps the answer is G.

Wait, but the second passage says that the covenant isn't preachable equally, and that some are given. So Calvin is making a point about the diversity of the covenant. So when someone teaches in that way, the people who are taught in that way are not given the same treatment. So perhaps the idea that some are given is the justification. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G because it's the only one that directly relates to the first passage. Or perhaps not.

Wait, the question is about the justification used by Calvin. So the second passage is about the diversity, which is a point of his reasoning. So perhaps the correct answer is G, because that's the only option that relates to the idea that salvation is not given to everyone.

Alternatively, perhaps the second passage's main point is that some are received, so that's a justification. But I don't see that as an option.

Wait, looking again at the options:

G: The idea that salvation is predetermined and not all individuals have access to it.

So Calvin's point is that salvation isn't given to all, but some are. So perhaps in his mind, the idea that not all have access is the justification. So the answer would be G.

But I thought he says that God doesn't accept all, but perhaps he doesn't believe that it's predestined. So perhaps the answer is G because it's the only option that refers to the diversity in the covenant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.

The options are about what Calvin believed in.

The second passage discusses that the covenant is not equally given to all, and that some are given. So that's a point Calvin makes. So his belief is that not all are given, and this is a justification.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the closest is G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps looking at the first passage: It says that the fruits of sin are condemned, but only those who are righteous receive it. So Calvin's main point is that not all are given. So perhaps the idea that some are given is the justification.

But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is G because it's the only one related to the first passage.

Wait, perhaps I should recall Calvin's own beliefs. He believed that salvation is not predestined but is given with some conditions. But that's not exactly any of the options.

Wait, another angle: the second passage says that "the fruits of sin, though in various passages of Scripture." That's about the nature of sin, not about the justification.

Wait, the second passage also talks about the covenant's diversity. So the idea that not all are given is a justification. So perhaps the answer is G, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G. Wait, the second passage's main idea is that the covenant isn't equally given to all, which is a point of his own. So the answer would be G, which is the idea that salvation isn't predestined but is given with some conditions.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

The question is asking which justification Calvin used. The second passage discusses the diversity in the covenant. But the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G because it's the only one that relates to the idea of some being given, which is Calvin's point.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G because it's the only one that seems to directly relate to the first passage, which talks about sin's fruits and the diversity.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is G, the idea that salvation isn't predestined, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because Calvin says that not all can be given, so it's the idea that some are accessible.

Wait, the second passage says that some are given, so perhaps the idea that some are accessible is a point of his reasoning. So the answer is G.

But I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option G, the idea that salvation is not predestined.

Wait, another approach: look at the structure of the passages. The first passage is about sin's fruits, the second about the covenant's diversity. So the correct answer is likely the one related to the second passage, which is about the diversity. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the second passage's main point is that the covenant isn't equally given to all, and that's a point he uses. So the justification is that not all can be given, which relates to option G.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J because it's about faith. But the second passage doesn't mention faith.

Wait, the second passage also says that the fruits of sin are condemned to those who are righteous, but not all. So Calvin is saying that only some are given. So the justification is that not all can be given. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G because it's the idea that salvation is not predestined, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should check what the options are again. The options are:

A: Everyone has access without priests.

B: Separation of church and state.

C: Acceptance of different faiths.

D: Relig. challenges monarchs.

E: corruption of the Catholic Church.

F: Church subordinate to state.

G: salvation is predetermined.

H: Churches self-govern.

I: teach in vernacular.

J: faith alone.

The question is about the justification used. The second passage discusses divergence in the covenant, thus the diversity of access. So perhaps the idea that not all are accessible is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G because it's the idea that salvation isn't predestined, which is a point he doesn't make. So I'm not sure anymore.

In conclusion, perhaps the correct answer is G because it's the only option that relates to the diversity in the covenant.

Wait, perhaps another thought. The second passage says that the covenant isn't equally given to all, so some are. So Calvin is using that point as a justification. So the answer is G.

But I think I made a mistake because the second passage didn't directly state that salvation isn't predestined. So perhaps the correct answer is G because it's the idea that some are accessible.
</think>

The correct answer is G: The idea that salvation is predetermined and not all individuals have access to it.

**Explanation:**

The second passage discusses the diversity in the covenant of life, which Calvin references. Calvin's point is that the covenant isn't equally accessible to all individuals, meaning some are given while others aren't. This discussion aligns with the idea that salvation isn't predestined but is given with certain conditions. However, the options don't explicitly state this. Instead, Calvin's main point is the diversity in the covenant, which is best captured by the idea that salvation isn't predestined. Therefore, the correct answer is G.
