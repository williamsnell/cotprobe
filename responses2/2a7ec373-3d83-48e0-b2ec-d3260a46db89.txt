Okay, so I'm trying to solve this financial question about Darv Co. Let's see what I remember. The question gives me the current ratio, quick ratio, and current liabilities. I need to find the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses. 

Hmm, let's start by recalling what these ratios mean. The current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. Oh wait, right, current ratio = (CA) / (CL). So if the current ratio is 3 to 1, that means CA is three times CL. 

The quick ratio is a bit different. Quick ratio is (CA minus inventory minus prepaid expenses) divided by CL. Wait, no: the quick ratio is (current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses) divided by current liabilities. Because quick ratio is a more stringent measure of liquidity because it excludes inventory and other less liquid current assets.

So the given quick ratio is 1 to 1. Let me jot down the knowns.

Current ratio (CR) = 3:1 → CA / CL = 3 → CA = 3 * CL. Current liabilities (CL) = $322,000. 

Quick ratio (QR) = 1:1 → (CA - Inv - Prepaid) / CL = 1. 

So substituting CL into the quick ratio equation: (CA - Inv - Prepaid) = CL. 

But CA can be expressed as 3 * CL. Let me plug that in. 

So, (3*CL - Inv - Prepaid) = CL.

Substituting CL as 322,000: 

3*322,000 - Inv - Prepaid = 322,000. 

Calculate that: 3*322,000 is 966,000. 

So 966,000 - Inv - Prepaid = 322,000. 

Then, subtracting 322,000 from both sides: 966,000 - 322,000 = Inv + Prepaid. 

So 644,000 = Inv + Prepaid. 

Wait, so the total for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option F is $644,000. So that's the answer. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the terms. Oh, no, the question is asking for the total of inventory and prepaid expenses, which that calculation gives. So yeah, the correct answer should be option F.

The current ratio of Darv Co. is 3:1, indicating that current assets are three times current liabilities. Given current liabilities are $322,000, current assets (CA) are 3 * $322,000 = $966,000. The quick ratio is 1:1, which means quick assets (CA − Inv − Prepaid) are equal to current liabilities. Substituting, we have $966,000 − Inv − Prepaid = $322,000. Solving, Inv + Prepaid = $644,000. Thus, the total for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000.

Answer: F
