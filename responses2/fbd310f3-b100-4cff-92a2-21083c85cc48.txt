Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about art. The question is asking about an important formal characteristic of art. The options are A through J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, let me think about what each option means. Formal characteristics are usually about the structure, form, or rules that define an art piece. So, I need to find the option that describes a structural or rule-based aspect.

Option A is the artist's nationality. That's more about personal identity, not formal structure. So probably not the answer.

Option B: Its power to evoke strong emotions. That's more about emotional impact, which is subjective, not a formal characteristic.

Option C: Social meaning. Hmm, social meaning relates to cultural or societal significance, which is personal, not strictly formal.

Option D: Use of geometric shapes. That's more about the elements or forms used in art, which is structural but maybe not the formal characteristic itself.

Option E: Size of the artwork. The size is more about presentation rather than form or structure.

Option F: Faithful representation. That's about accuracy, which is a technical aspect, not formal.

Option G: Ability to depict historical events accurately. Again, that's about the content's correctness, more about truth than structure.

Option H: Coherence. Coherence refers to the consistency and structure of the art piece. Like how the pieces flow into each other or how the subject matter is organized. That sounds like a formal characteristic because it's about how the elements are connected.

Option I: Monetary value. That's about the worth in terms of money, which is practical, not structural.

Option J: Use of vibrant colors. Color choice is about visual appeal, not structure.

So, looking back, formal characteristics are about the structure itself. H, coherence, seems to fit. Coherence is about how the elements are organized and connected, which is a structural aspect. So the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: its coherence.
