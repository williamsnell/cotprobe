Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about four machines producing defective items, and we need to find the probability that a randomly selected defective item was produced by each machine. 

Alright, let's break down what's given. Four machines: A, B, C, D. Each has a certain percentage of their output, which is 10% (0.10), 20% (0.20), 30% (0.30), and 40% (0.40) respectively. Then, each machine has a certain defect rate: 0.10% (0.001), 0.05% (0.0005), 0.5% (0.005), and 0.2% (0.002) respectively.

Wait, so the probability that a machine produces a defective item is the product of its percentage output and the defect rate. Let me write that down.

Machine A: 0.10 * 0.001 = 0.0001
Machine B: 0.20 * 0.0005 = 0.0001
Machine C: 0.30 * 0.005 = 0.0015
Machine D: 0.40 * 0.002 = 0.0008

Wait, no, wait. Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.10 * 0.001 is 0.0001, which is 0.01%. But wait, isn't that a very low probability? Let me make sure I'm calculating this correctly. Oh wait, no, the percentages are already outputs, so multiplying by the defect rate gives the defective rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the question is worded is that the machines produce 10% of the output, 20%, etc. Then, each machine produces a defective percentage of its output. So, for example, machine A (10%) makes 0.10% of its output defective. So the probability that a randomly selected item is defective and produced by machine A is (0.10 * 0.001) = 0.0001. Similarly for the others.

So, each machine's defective items would be:

- A: 0.10 * 0.001 = 0.0001
- B: 0.20 * 0.0005 = 0.0001
- C: 0.30 * 0.005 = 0.0015
- D: 0.40 * 0.002 = 0.0008

Wait, but wait, 0.20 * 0.0005 is 0.0001, and 0.30 * 0.005 is 0.0015. Hmm, but that seems a bit low. Let me think—so the total number of defective items is the sum of all individual defective items.

Let me compute the total defective items across all machines:

Total defectives = 0.0001 (A) + 0.0001 (B) + 0.0015 (C) + 0.0008 (D) =

Adding them up: 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002; 0.0015 is 0.0015, and 0.0008 is 0.0008. So 0.0002 + 0.0015 = 0.0017; 0.0017 + 0.0008 = 0.0025.

So the total defective items are 0.0025. Wait, but that seems a bit small, but maybe that's correct.

Now, the question is, given that a randomly selected item is defective, what is the probability it was produced by each machine. This sounds like a Bayes' theorem problem. So, the probability that the item was produced by machine M_i given that it's defective is P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i) / P(defective overall).

So, let's compute P(defective | M_i) for each machine, which we've already calculated as:

- A: 0.0001
- B: 0.0001
- C: 0.0015
- D: 0.0008

And P(M_i) is given as 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40 respectively.

So, for each machine, the numerator is P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i), and the denominator is the total P(defective) = sum of all numerators.

So, let's compute each numerator:

Machine A: 0.10 * 0.0001 = 0.00001
Machine B: 0.20 * 0.0001 = 0.00002
Machine C: 0.30 * 0.0015 = 0.00045
Machine D: 0.40 * 0.0008 = 0.00032

Now, sum these up for the denominator: 0.00001 + 0.00002 = 0.00003; 0.00045 + 0.00032 = 0.00077. So total is 0.00003 + 0.00077 = 0.0008.

Wait, but wait—this can't be right. Because 0.00003 + 0.00077 is 0.0008, but that's only 0.0008. But from earlier, the total defective items are 0.0025, which should be the denominator. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recheck the math.

Wait, for machine A:

0.10 (A's output) * 0.001 (defective rate) = 0.10 * 0.001 = 0.0001.

Machine B: 0.20 * 0.0005 = 0.0001.

Machine C: 0.30 * 0.005 = 0.0015.

Machine D: 0.40 * 0.002 = 0.0008.

Adding those together: 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002; 0.0015 + 0.0008 = 0.0023. So total defective is 0.0002 + 0.0023 = 0.0025.

So the denominator is 0.0025.

Wait, but when I calculated each numerator as 0.00001, 0.00002, 0.00045, 0.00032, their sum is 0.00001 + 0.00002 = 0.00003; 0.00045 + 0.00032 = 0.00077. So 0.00003 + 0.00077 = 0.0008.

Wait, but that's way smaller than the total defective of 0.0025. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake. Where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait a second. Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the defective items per machine is incorrect. Let me re-examine.

Wait, each machine's defective rate is given as a percentage, but I think I might have confused the units. The problem states that machine A produces 10% of the output, and has a defect rate of 0.001 (which is 0.1%). So the defective rate is 0.1%, yes.

So, for machine A, 10% of the output is defective, and 0.1% of that is defective. So 0.1% of 10% is 0.001 (because 0.1% of 10% is 0.0001). Wait, no, 0.1% is 0.001 in decimal. 10% is 0.1. So 0.001 * 0.1 = 0.0001.

Wait, but that's correct. So machine A's defective items are 0.0001.

Same for machine B: 20% output, 0.05% defect rate.

Wait, 20% is 0.2. 0.05% is 0.0005. So 0.2 * 0.0005 = 0.0001.

Wait, that's correct. So machine B's defective items are 0.0001.

Machine C: 30% output (0.3), defect rate 0.5% (0.005). 0.3 * 0.005 = 0.0015.

Machine D: 40% (0.4), defect rate 0.2% (0.002). 0.4 * 0.002 = 0.0008.

So adding them: 0.0001 (A) + 0.0001 (B) = 0.0002; 0.0015 (C) + 0.0008 (D) = 0.0023. Total is 0.0002 + 0.0023 = 0.0025.

So, the denominator in Bayes' theorem is 0.0025.

Now, the numerator for machine A is 0.10 * 0.0001 = 0.00001.

Similarly:

A: 0.00001

B: 0.00002

C: 0.3 * 0.005 * 0.10? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. The formula is P(defective) = sum( P(defective | M_i) P(M_i) ).

So for each machine, it's (P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i)).

So, for each machine, compute that product.

So:

A: 0.1 * 0.0001 = 0.00001.

B: 0.2 * 0.0001 = 0.00002.

C: 0.3 * 0.0015 = 0.00045.

D: 0.4 * 0.0008 = 0.00032.

Adding all these:

0.00001 + 0.00002 = 0.00003.

0.00045 + 0.00032 = 0.00077.

Total: 0.00003 + 0.00077 = 0.0008.

Wait, but the total of the numerator is 0.0008, but the total defectives are 0.0025. That doesn't add up. Because 0.0008 is much smaller than 0.0025. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm adding. Let me check again.

Wait, 0.00001 + 0.00002 = 0.00003.

0.00045 + 0.00032 = 0.00077.

0.00003 + 0.00077 = 0.0008.

But the total defective is 0.0025, which is much larger than 0.0008. So I must have made a mistake in the way I calculated the numerator.

Wait, perhaps I should have calculated each P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i) correctly.

Wait, for machine A: 0.1 * 0.0001 = 0.00001.

Machine B: 0.2 * 0.0001 = 0.00002.

Machine C: 0.3 * 0.0015 = 0.00045.

Machine D: 0.4 * 0.0008 = 0.00032.

So adding 0.00001 + 0.00002 = 0.00003.

0.00045 + 0.00032 = 0.00077.

Total: 0.00003 + 0.00077 = 0.0008.

Wait, but that's 0.0008, but the total defective is 0.0025. So the sum of the numerators is 0.0008, which can't be right because that's much less than the actual total. So where's the mistake here?

Wait, maybe I should have done 0.1 * 0.001, but wait, no. Wait, maybe the way I computed the defectives per machine was correct, but perhaps the initial calculation of the total defective is wrong.

Wait, let me re-calculate the total defective items.

Machine A: 0.10 * 0.001 = 0.0001.

Machine B: 0.20 * 0.0005 = 0.0001.

Machine C: 0.30 * 0.005 = 0.0015.

Machine D: 0.40 * 0.002 = 0.0008.

So sum: 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002; 0.0015 + 0.0008 = 0.0023. Total is 0.0002 + 0.0023 = 0.0025.

So total defective is 0.0025. So the denominator is 0.0025.

But according to the numerator, the sum is 0.0008, so perhaps the way I'm calculating the numerator is wrong. Wait, perhaps I should have multiplied P(M_i) by P(defective | M_i). So for each machine, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have been calculating each P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i) as a numerator, but the total is 0.0025, so the sum of numerators is 0.0008. That's impossible because the denominator is 0.0025, which should be the sum of the numerators.

Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the numerator. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should have multiplied the products correctly.

Wait, for machine A: 0.10 * 0.001 = 0.0001.

Machine B: 0.20 * 0.0005 = 0.0001.

Machine C: 0.30 * 0.005 = 0.0015.

Machine D: 0.40 * 0.002 = 0.0008.

Now, adding all these up: 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002; 0.0015 + 0.0008 = 0.0023. So total is 0.0002 + 0.0023 = 0.0025. So that's correct.

So the denominator is 0.0025.

Now, let's compute each machine's P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i):

A: 0.1 * 0.001 = 0.0001.

B: 0.2 * 0.0005 = 0.0001.

C: 0.3 * 0.005 = 0.0015.

D: 0.4 * 0.002 = 0.0008.

So the four numerators are 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.0015, 0.0008.

Adding them: 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002; 0.0015 + 0.0008 = 0.0023. So total is 0.0002 + 0.0023 = 0.0025.

Wait, but that's the same as the denominator. So each numerator is a part of the denominator. So the sum of the numerators is 0.0025, which matches the denominator.

So each numerator is a fraction of the total, which is 0.0025.

Wait, but how does that help me in finding the probabilities? Oh, right, I need to compute the probability that a randomly selected defective item is from each machine. So, using Bayes' theorem, it's (P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i)) / P(defective overall).

So each numerator is the numerator (P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i)), and the denominator is P(defective overall) = 0.0025.

So for each machine, the probability is (P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i)) / 0.0025.

Let's compute each:

A: (0.1 * 0.001) / 0.0025 = 0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04.

B: (0.2 * 0.0005) / 0.0025 = 0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04.

C: (0.3 * 0.005) / 0.0025 = 0.0015 / 0.0025 = 0.6.

D: (0.4 * 0.002) / 0.0025 = 0.0008 / 0.0025 = 0.32.

Wait, but wait, let me check these calculations again.

Wait, for machine A:

0.1 * 0.001 = 0.0001.

Divided by 0.0025: 0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04.

Similarly, for machine B:

0.2 * 0.0005 = 0.0001.

0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04.

Machine C:

0.3 * 0.005 = 0.0015.

0.0015 / 0.0025 = 0.6.

Machine D:

0.4 * 0.002 = 0.0008.

0.0008 / 0.0025 = 0.32.

So the probabilities are:

A: 0.04, B: 0.04, C: 0.6, D: 0.32.

Wait, but let me check the sum of these probabilities. 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.08; 0.6 + 0.32 = 0.92; total 0.08 + 0.92 = 1.00. Perfect. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, the probabilities for each machine are:

A: 0.04, which is 4%.

B: 0.04, same as A.

C: 0.6, which is 60%.

D: 0.32, which is 32%.

So the answer should be the option where each machine's probability is as above.

Looking at the options provided:

Option C shows:

P(M_1) = 0.1, P(M_2) = 0.2, P(M_3) = 0.3, P(M_4) = 0.4.

P(defective | M_i): A: 0.001, B: 0.0005, C: 0.005, D: 0.002.

So option C's probabilities are correct for each machine.

Wait, but let me double-check if the way I computed the total of the numerators is correct. Because according to the Bayes' formula, the numerator should be the sum of P(M_i) * P(defective | M_i) for each machine. So, in this case, that sum is 0.0001 + 0.0001 + 0.0015 + 0.0008 = 0.0025, which is correct. So the denominator is 0.0025, so each probability is that numerator divided by 0.0025.

So, for example, for machine A: 0.0001 / 0.0025 = 0.04.

For machine B: same.

For machine C: 0.0015 / 0.0025 = 0.6.

For machine D: 0.0008 / 0.0025 = 0.32.

So the probabilities are correct.

Looking back at the options, option C's probabilities are:

P(M_1) = 0.1, P(M_2) = 0.2, P(M_3) = 0.3, P(M_4) = 0.4.

P(defective | M_i): A: 0.001, B: 0.0005, C: 0.005, D: 0.002.

So option C's probabilities are correct for each machine.

So the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The correct probabilities are as follows:

Option C lists the correct probabilities for each machine:

- P(M1) = 0.1, P(M2) = 0.2, P(M3) = 0.3, P(M4) = 0.4.
- P(defective | M1) = 0.001, P(defective | M2) = 0.0005, P(defective | M3) = 0.005, P(defective | M4) = 0.002.

Thus, option C is correct. 

ANSWER: C
