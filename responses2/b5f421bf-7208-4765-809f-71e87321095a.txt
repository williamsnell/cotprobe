Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about production costs, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that producing one unit of good Y requires 3 workers and 7 units of capital. The wage rate is $4, and the rental rate for capital is $1. We're being asked about the marginal physical product of capital (MPPK) and the total cost when the marginal physical product of labor (MPPL) is $2. 

Wait, let me make sure I got all the details right. So, each unit of Y needs 3 workers and 7 capital. The wage is $4 per worker, and capital costs $1 per unit. So, each worker's wage is $4, and each capital unit is $1. 

I remember that in the cost minimization condition, the ratio of the wage rate to the rental rate should be equal to the ratio of the marginal physical products of the inputs. Oh right, the condition is (MPL / MPK) = (w / r), where w is the wage rate and r is the rental rate. 

So, in this case, the wage rate w is $4, and the rent rate r is $1. So, w/r is 4/1 = 4. Therefore, the ratio of MPL to MPK should be 4. That is, MPL/MPK = 4 → MPL = 4 * MPK.

But wait, the question is asking about MPPK when MPL is $2. Oh, right. So we can set MPL to 2. Then, 2 = 4 * MPK → MPK = 2 / 4 = 0.5. So the MPPK is 0.5. 

Wait, but the options are about MPPK being one of the options. So, MPPK is 0.5, which is option B. Then, what's the total cost?

Hmm, the total cost would depend on the quantities of capital and labor used. But wait, how many units of Y are being produced? Oh, the question doesn't specify, but I think the question is about the marginal physical product in terms of minimizing costs, so maybe the quantity isn't specified. Oh wait, no — perhaps the question is just about the ratio condition, and then the cost is calculated based on that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the production function. If each unit of Y requires 3 workers and 7 capital, then if you produce Q units of Y, you need 3Q workers and 7Q capital. But that might not be the case here because the question might be referring to the marginal physical product, which is the additional output per unit of input. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of the cost minimization condition. The condition is that the ratio of the MPP to the wage rate should be equal to the ratio of the MPK to the rental rate, but wait, no: the ratio is (MPL / w) = (MPK / r). Or is it (MPL / w) = (MPK / r) ?

Wait, no, the cost minimization condition is that the ratio of the marginal products to the input prices is equal. So (MPL / w) = (MPK / r). So, in this case, (MPL / 4) = (MPK / 1). So, MPPK = (MPL / 4) → MPPK = 2 / 4 = 0.5.

So, MPPK is 0.5, which is option B. Now, what's the total cost? Hmm, I need to figure this out. 

Wait, total cost would be the cost of labor plus the cost of capital. So if we're producing one unit of Y, we need 3 workers and 7 capital units. But wait, the question doesn't state how many Y units are produced; it's just asking about the ratio of MPPK and the total cost. Oh, but perhaps the question is about the condition for minimizing cost when producing one unit of Y.

Wait, but in that case, the total cost would be 3 workers * $4 + 7 capital * $1 = $12 + $7 = $19. But that's if you produce one unit, but the options are for each unit — perhaps each unit requires 3 workers and 7 capital. 

Wait, no, looking at the problem again, it says "the production of a unit of good Y requires the employment of 3 workers and 7 units of capital." So, each unit requires 3 workers and 7 capital. So, to produce one unit, you need 3 workers and 7 capital. Therefore, the total cost would be (3*4) + (7*1) = 12 + 7 = $19. 

Wait, but the options list total costs, so for each unit, the total cost is $19. But the options for MPPK are given, and the question is for the MPPK and total cost.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-examine the question. The question is asking what should be the MPPK in order for the production to be carried out at the least cost when the MPPL is $2. Then, what is the total cost in that scenario.

Wait, wait. The question gives us that MPPL is $2, and we're to find MPPK.

So, as I said earlier, the cost minimization condition is (MPL / w) = (MPK / r). So, MPPK = (MPL / w) * r.

Wait, wait, let me write it correctly. The condition is:

(MPL / w) = (MPK / r)

So, rearranged, MPK = (MPL * r) / w.

Given that MPPL (MPL) is $2, w is $4, r is $1.

So, MPK = (2 * 1) / 4 = 2/4 = 0.5. So MPPK is 0.5. So option B.

Now, what is the total cost? Well, the question is about the cost of producing a single unit of Y. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about how many units of Y are produced and the total cost. 

Wait, no, looking again, the question says: "What should be the marginal physical product of capital in order for the production to be carried out at the least cost and what is this cost if the marginal physical product of labor is $2?"

Wait, perhaps it's asking for both MPPK and the total cost of producing one unit of Y. But let's think again. Alternatively, perhaps the production of one unit requires 3 workers and 7 capital, so the total cost is 3*4 +7*1=12+7=19. But that would be if each unit requires that much.

But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the condition for cost minimization, which we've already calculated MPPK =0.5. Then, the total cost for producing one unit would be 3 workers *4 +7 capital *1 = $12 +7= $19. So the total cost would be $19.

Looking at the options, option B says MPPK=0.5 and total cost=19, which would correspond to the scenario of producing one unit. So the correct answer would be option B.
</think>

To determine the marginal physical product of capital (MPPK) and the total cost of producing a unit of good Y, we use the cost minimization condition, which states that the ratio of marginal physical products to input prices must be equal:

\[
\frac{\text{MPL}}{w} = \frac{\text{MPK}}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( \text{MPL} = \$2 \) (marginal physical product of labor),
- \( w = \$4 \) (wage rate),
- \( r = \$1 \) (rental rate for capital).

### Step 1: Calculate MPPK
Rearranging the cost minimization condition:

\[
\text{MPK} = \frac{\text{MPL} \times r}{w}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{MPK} = \frac{2 \times 1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
\]

Thus, the MPPK is \( 0.5 \).

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost
The total cost is the sum of the costs of labor and capital. Since each unit of good Y requires 3 workers and 7 units of capital, the total cost for producing one unit is:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = (3 \times \$4) + (7 \times \$1) = \$12 + \$7 = \$19
\]

### Final Answer
The marginal physical product of capital is \( 0.5 \), and the total cost of producing one unit of good Y is \( \$19 \). This corresponds to **Option B**.
