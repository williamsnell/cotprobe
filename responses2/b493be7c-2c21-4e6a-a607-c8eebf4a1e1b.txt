Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electric fields and curved charged rods. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a charge distributed along a bent rod forming a circular arc. The rod has a length of 4.0 meters, and it's bent into a circle with a radius of 2.0 meters. The charge is 20 nC, which is 20 times 10^-9 coulombs. I'm supposed to find the electric field at the center of curvature of this arc.

Hmm, I remember that when a charge is distributed along a straight line, the electric field it produces at the center is straightforward because each point's contribution is linear. But when the charge is on a curved path, like a circular arc, the situation is different. Each infinitesimal charge element on the arc contributes to the electric field at the center.

Wait, right, the electric field is a vector quantity, so each segment of the rod contributes a vector to the total field. Because the rod is symmetric around the center of curvature, maybe the contributions from opposite segments cancel out in certain directions. But I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the setup. The rod is a circular arc with radius 2m, and its total length is 4m. Wait, the circumference of a full circle is 2πr, so 2π*2 is about 12.566 meters. But the rod is only 4m long. So it's a small arc, but not a full circle.

Wait, the angle theta (θ) of the arc can be found using the length. The length of the arc is 4m. The formula for arc length is rθ, where θ is in radians. So θ = 4 / 2 = 2 radians. So the rod forms a 2 radian angle in a circle of radius 2m. That's about 114 degrees, since π radians is 180 degrees, so 2 radians is approximately 114.59 degrees.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, r is 2 m, the arc length is 4 m. So θ (radians) = 4 / 2 = 2 radians. Yep, that's correct.

So each small segment of charge is at a distance of 2 m from the center. The charge per unit length (lambda) is Q divided by the length of the rod. Q is 20 nC, which is 20e-9 C. So lambda = 20e-9 / 4 = 5e-9 C/m.

Each small charge dq is lambda * dl, where dl is the length element. So dq = lambda * dl.

The electric field contribution from a small segment is dE = (k dq) / r², where r is the distance from the segment to the center. But since r is the same for all segments (because it's a circular arc with radius 2m), the magnitude of each dE is (k * lambda * dl) / (r²) = (k lambda dl) / (4) because r is 2. So (k * 5e-9 * dl) / 4.

Wait, but direction matters. Each dE vector is tangential to the arc. Since the rod is symmetric, the contributions from opposite sides might cancel. But wait, for a small segment, the direction depends on where it is. For example, a segment at angle theta from the x-axis would have a direction of the tangent at that point, which is at angle theta + π/2. So the contributions from opposite sides might indeed cancel each other out because the vectors point in opposite directions.

Wait, but maybe not. Let me consider two opposite points. Suppose we have a segment at angle theta and another at angle theta + π. The vectors for their dE fields would point in opposite directions because the tangents at those angles are perpendicular. So the x-components might cancel, and the y-components might cancel too, leaving a net zero electric field? Or is that not the case when the angles are small?

Wait, actually, no. Because the arc is a small angle (theta = 2 radians, so about 114 degrees), not a full semicircle. So the contributions from opposite points may not fully cancel. Hmm, perhaps I should model this mathematically.

The electric field at the center is a vector sum. Since the rod is symmetric, but not symmetrically placed in terms of angles. Wait, but for each small segment dq at angle theta, its contribution to the electric field would have both radial and tangential components. The radial component would point from the center to the segment, and the tangential component is perpendicular to that.

But wait, the electric field at the center is a vector sum. So each segment's dE vector is the vector sum of the radial and tangential contributions. But due to the symmetry of the setup, the radial components (which are in the direction of the segment) would all add up.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The electric field from dq is dE = (k dq) / r². Since each segment is at radius r (2 m), r² is 4. So each dE is (k lambda dl) /4, which is (8.988e9) * (5e-9) * dl /4.

Wait, but dl is a small element, and the direction of each dE is radial. So the angle that each dE makes with the radial direction is 90 degrees? Wait no, the direction of the electric field due to a segment on a circular arc is tangential to the arc at that point.

Wait, I'm getting confused. The electric field at the center due to a small segment at angle theta is directed along the tangent at theta. So the tangent is perpendicular to the radius. So each dE vector is tangential, which is perpendicular to the radial direction.

But the vector sum of all these dE vectors would be the integral of the tangential vectors from 0 to theta, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem in terms of integration. Let's model the rod as an arc of θ radians. Each tiny segment at angle φ (from 0 to θ) contributes a dE vector. The angle of each dE vector is at angle φ + 90 degrees (since tangent is perpendicular to radius). So the dE vector points in the direction of φ+90 degrees.

So the x and y components of each dE would be:

dE_x = (dE) * cos(phi + 90°) = -dE * sin(phi)
dE_y = (dE) * sin(phi + 90°) = dE * cos(phi)

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. The electric field direction is along the tangent, which is at an angle of phi + 90 degrees from the positive x-axis. So the components would be:

dE_x = dE * cos(phi + 90°) = -dE sin(phi)
dE_y = dE * sin(phi +90°) = dE cos(phi)

Wait, but each segment contributes a vector in the direction of its tangent. So for each phi, the components are as above.

But when summing over all phi from 0 to theta, the x and y components may not cancel because the contributions are vectors. But wait, considering that the rod is symmetrically placed, perhaps the sum in x and y directions would be zero?

Wait, no. Because the rod is symmetric around the center of curvature, but not symmetrically arranged in all directions. For example, imagine the rod being a small arc. The contributions from segments on opposite sides of the arc might not cancel. So the net electric field could have both x and y components.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by using integration in polar coordinates.

The electric field at the center due to a small element dq is dE = (k dq) / r², where r is 2 m. So dE = (k * 5e-9 C/m * dl) / (4 m²) ) = (k *5e-9 * dl) /4.

But dl is 2 dφ (since dl = r dφ, and r is 2 m). So dl= 2 dφ.

So substituting, dE = (k *5e-9 * 2 dφ) /4 = (k *5e-9 * dφ)/2.

But wait, the direction of dE is tangential to the arc at each point, which is at angle phi + pi/2. So the components would be:

dE_x = dE * cos(phi + pi/2) = -dE sin(phi)
dE_y = dE * sin(phi + pi/2) = dE cos(phi)

So the total E_x is the integral from phi=0 to theta of dE_x, and similarly E_y is the integral from phi=0 to theta of dE_y.

So E_x = ∫ [ -dE sin(phi) ] from phi=0 to theta = - (5e-9 k /2 ) ∫ sin(phi) d phi from 0 to theta.

Compute that integral: ∫ sin(phi) d phi from 0 to theta is [ -cos(theta) + cos(0) ] = 1 - cos(theta).

So E_x = - (5e-9 k /2 ) (1 - cos(theta)).

Similarly, E_y = ∫ [dE cos(phi) ] d phi = (5e-9 k /2 ) ∫ cos(phi) d phi from 0 to theta.

The integral of cos(phi) is sin(phi), so from 0 to theta, it's sin(theta) - 0 = sin(theta).

So E_y = (5e-9 k /2 ) sin(theta).

Wait, but wait, what about the actual setup. The arc is a small angle theta=2 radians. So let's compute these terms.

First, compute theta in radians: 2 radians.

Compute cos(theta) = cos(2) ≈ -0.4161.
Compute sin(theta) = sin(2) ≈ 0.9093.

So E_x = - (5e-9 * 8.988e9 / 2) * (1 - (-0.4161)) = -(5e-9 * 4.494e9 ) * (1.4161 )

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Compute E_x:

E_x = - (5e-9 * 8.988e9 / 2 ) * (1 - cos(theta)) = -(5e-9 * (8.988e9 / 2 )) * (1 - (-0.4161)).

Compute 8.988e9 /2 = 4.494e9.

Multiply by 5e-9: 5e-9 * 4.494e9 = 5 * 4.494 * 1e0 = 22.47.

Multiply by (1 - (-0.4161 )) = 1.4161: 22.47 * 1.4161 ≈ 31.86.

But E_x is negative, so -31.86 N/C.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations:

Compute 5e-9 * (8.988e9 / 2) = 5e-9 * 4.494e9 = 5 * 4.494 * 1e0 = 22.47.

Multiply by (1 - (-0.4161)) = 1.4161.

22.47 * 1.4161 ≈ 31.86.

So E_x ≈ -31.86 N/C.

Now E_y:

E_y = (5e-9 * 8.988e9 / 2 ) * sin(theta) = same 22.47, multiplied by 0.9093.

So 22.47 * 0.9093 ≈ 20.48 N/C.

Wait, but wait a second. The contributions from each segment are in the direction of the tangent, so for each segment, the x-component is dE_x = -dE sin(phi), and the y is dE cos(phi). So integrating these gives E_x and E_y as above.

So the net electric field E is the vector sum of E_x and E_y.

Thus, the magnitude is sqrt( (E_x)^2 + (E_y)^2 ) = sqrt( (31.86)^2 + (20.48)^2 )

Compute 31.86²: about 1014. 20.48² is about 419. So sum is 1433. Square root is about 37.85 N/C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 38, which matches approximately here.

But wait, another thing to consider: is the angle theta in radians 2, which is small. For such angles, the approximation sin(theta) ≈ theta (in radians) might be more accurate. Wait, theta is 2 radians, which is about 114 degrees, not small. So maybe the more accurate approach is to compute the exact integral.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I used exact theta as 2 radians. So perhaps the approximate approach for small angles isn't applicable here. But wait, wait, no: the rod is a small arc, but the exact angle isn't necessarily small. So the exact calculation should be done.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the electric field.

Wait, when I integrated, I considered that each dE_x is negative because the direction is to the left (assuming theta is measured from the positive x-axis). But the exact direction of the tangent depends on the position, so perhaps the integral of dE_x is a negative value, and dE_y is positive.

Wait, but let me see: for each segment, the electric field is pointing tangentially. So for a segment at angle phi, the tangent is at phi + 90 degrees. So the x-component is negative (cos(phi +90)= -sin(phi)), and the y-component is positive (sin(phi +90) = cos(phi)).

So when I integrate over phi from 0 to theta, the E_x is negative, because sin(phi) is positive in 0 to theta. Wait, no: sin(phi) is positive for phi between 0 and pi, which is 0 to 180 degrees. But theta here is 2 radians, about 114 degrees, which is less than 180. So sin(phi) is positive in 0 to 114 degrees.

Wait, but wait, phi ranges from 0 to 2 radians. So sin(phi) is positive throughout.

So E_x would be negative, and E_y positive.

So, when computing the integral:

E_x = - (5e-9 * 8.988e9 / 2 ) * (1 - cos(theta)) = - (5e-9 * 4.494e9 ) * 1.4161.

Wait, wait, 1 - cos(theta) is positive because theta is 2 radians. So that term is positive, so E_x is negative.

Wait, but then E_y is positive. So the total E is the vector sum of E_x (negative) and E_y (positive). So in terms of magnitude, the answer is sqrt(E_x^2 + E_y^2). But wait, let me compute the exact numbers.

Wait, let's compute the exact values:

Compute E_x first.

E_x = - (5e-9 * 8.988e9 / 2 ) * (1 - cos(2 radians)).

Compute 5e-9 * 8.988e9 /2: 5e-9 * 4.494e9 = 22.47.

Multiply by (1 - cos(2)): 1 - (-0.4161) = 1.4161. So 22.47 * 1.4161 ≈ 31.86.

So E_x = -31.86 N/C.

E_y = (5e-9 * 8.988e9 /2 ) * sin(2).

Compute 22.47 * 0.9093 ≈ 20.48. So E_y = 20.48 N/C.

So the electric field vector is (-31.86, 20.48) N/C. The magnitude is sqrt( (31.86)^2 + (20.48)^2 ).

Compute 31.86 squared: 31.86 *31.86 ≈ (30^2 is 900, 1.86^2≈3.46, 2*30*1.86=111.6 → 900 + 111.6 + 3.46 ≈ 1015.06).

20.48 squared is approx 419.3.

Sum is 1434.36, square root is about 37.86 N/C. Looking at the options, option C is 38 N/C. So the answer is C.

To determine the magnitude of the electric field at the center of curvature of a charged rod bent into a circular arc, we analyze the contributions from each infinitesimal segment of the rod. The rod has a total length of 4.0 m, forms a circular arc with a radius of 2.0 m, and is uniformly distributed with a charge density of \( \lambda = 20 \, \text{nC/m} \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Arc Length and Angle**:  
   The length of the arc is \( r\theta \), where \( r = 2.0 \, \text{m} \) and \( \theta = 4.0 / 2.0 = 2.0 \, \text{radians} \). Thus, \( \theta = 2.0 \, \text{radians} \).

2. **Electric Field Contribution**:  
   Each infinitesimal segment \( dq \) contributes an electric field \( d\vec{E} = \frac{k \, dq}{r^2} \) at the center of curvature, where \( r = 2.0 \, \text{m} \). The magnitude of the electric field is \( dE = \frac{k \lambda \, dl}{r^2} = \frac{k \lambda \, r \, d\theta}{r^2} = \frac{k \lambda \, d\theta}{r} \). Substituting \( \lambda = 20 \, \text{nC/m} = 20 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C/m} \), \( r = 2.0 \, \text{m} \), and \( d\theta = d\theta \), we find:
   \[
   dE = \frac{k \cdot 20 \times 10^{-9} \cdot d\theta}{2.0} = 5 \times 10^{-9} \cdot d\theta \, \text{N}.
   \]

3. **Direction of the Electric Field**:  
   The electric field at the center of curvature points tangentially to the arc at each point. For a segment at angle \( \phi \), the tangential direction is \( \phi + \pi/2 \). The electric field components are:
   \[
   dE_x = -dE \sin\phi, \quad dE_y = dE \cos\phi.
   \]

4. **Integration**:  
   The total electric field is obtained by integrating \( dE_x \) and \( dE_y \) over the arc:
   \[
   E_x = -\int_0^\theta dE \sin\phi \, d\phi = -\int_0^\theta 5 \times 10^{-9} \sin\phi \, d\phi = -5 \times 10^{-9} \left[ -\cos\phi \right]_0^\theta = -5 \times 10^{-9} (1 - \cos\theta),
   \]
   \[
   E_y = \int_0^\theta dE \cos\phi \, d\phi = \int_0^\theta 5 \times 10^{-9} \cos\phi \, d\phi = 5 \times 10^{-9} \left[ \sin\phi \right]_0^\theta = 5 \times 10^{-9} \sin\theta.
   \]

5. **Evaluating the Integrals**:  
   Using \( \theta = 2.0 \, \text{radians} \), \( \cos(2.0) \approx -0.4161 \), and \( \sin(2.0) \approx 0.9093 \):
   \[
   E_x = -5 \times 10^{-9} (1 - (-0.4161)) = -5 \times 10^{-9} (1.4161) \approx -31.86 \, \text{N/C},
   \]
   \[
   E_y = 5 \times 10^{-9} (0.9093) \approx 20.48 \, \text{N/C}.
   \]

6. **Magnitude of the Electric Field**:  
   The total electric field is the vector sum of \( E_x \) and \( E_y \):
   \[
   E = \sqrt{E_x^2 + E_y^2} = \sqrt{(-31.86)^2 + (20.48)^2}.
   \]
   Compute \( (-31.86)^2 = 1015 \), \( (20.48)^2 = 419 \), so:
   \[
   E = \sqrt{1015 + 419} = \sqrt{1434} \approx 37.86 \, \text{N/C}.
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:  
   The magnitude of the electric field is approximately \( 38 \, \text{N/C} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
