Okay, so I have this economics question here about marginal cost and average variable cost. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think about what I remember from my microeconomics class.

So, the question is asking where the marginal cost (MC) intersects average variable cost (AVC). The options are various points related to cost curves like minimum average total cost, average variable cost, etc.

Wait, I remember that MC and AVC both relate to the cost of producing each additional unit. But how do they interact? Oh right, the MC curve is the derivative of the total cost. On the other hand, average variable cost is total variable cost divided by the quantity.

I think when you're producing the first units, the MC will be less than the average variable cost because you're just starting. Once you start producing more, at some point, the MC will equal the AVC. That's the point where the average variable cost starts to rise or maybe the minimum point.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. When you're producing, the marginal cost is the cost of the next unit. So, as you produce more units, the marginal cost can be either lower or higher than the average variable cost.

Wait, no, I think that the MC curve and the AVC curve touch each other at the minimum point of the AVC curve. Because at the minimum point, the MC equals the AVC. So, the MC intersects the AVC at the minimum average variable cost.

So looking at the options, option G is the minimum of average variable cost. But wait, the question is about where MC intersects AVC. So, the MC curve and the AVC curve meet at the minimum point of the average variable cost curve.

Wait, let me think again. The MC curve is always U-shaped, and the AVC curve is also U-shaped but below the MC curve. The point where MC and AVC intersect is the minimum point of the AVC. So, the intersection is at the minimum of AVC, which is option G.

So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: the minimum of average variable cost.

**Answer:** G
