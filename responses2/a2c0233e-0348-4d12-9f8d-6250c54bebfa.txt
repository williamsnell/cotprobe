C: 4 * ['Hi!']
D: ['Hi!4']
E: Error
F: ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']
G: ['Hi!Hi!Hi!Hi!']
H: ['Hi!'] * 4
I: ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']
J: None of the above.

Okay, so I have this Python question here, and I need to figure out the correct output when I run ['Hi!'] multiplied by four. Hmm, let's think about what the question is asking.

The question is in Python 3, and the code is ['Hi!'] * 4. Oh right, in Python, when you use the multiplication operator on a list, it duplicates the list that many times. So the list ['Hi!'] is being multiplied by 4, which means it's creating a new list that has four copies of ['Hi!'].

Wait, but when I look at the options, option B is ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!'], which seems to be the case. Let me double-check. So each multiplication by four would create four elements in the new list.

What about the other options? Option A says it's an array with ['Hi!',4], which doesn't make sense in Python. Lists are immutable, so you can't multiply a list by an integer and expect it to add elements. So A is incorrect.

Option C is 4 multiplied by ['Hi!'], but that's just a syntax error because 4 is an integer and you can't multiply a list by an integer like that. So C is not valid Python syntax.

Option D is ['Hi!4'], which would be if you concatenated the strings but that's not the case here. So that's not correct.

Option E is an error. Wait, why would that be? Well, perhaps I'm forgetting something. Wait, no, the multiplication is valid, so E might not be the right answer.

Option F is the same as option B, which is correct. So F is the same as B. Oh wait, looking back, option B is exactly that.

Option G is ['Hi!Hi!Hi!Hi!'], which would be the result of concatenating four 'Hi!' strings together, but that's not what the multiplication operator does. Multiplication duplicates the list, not concatenates the elements.

Option H is the same as option B, which is correct.

Option I is ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!','Hi!','Hi!', 'Hi!','Hi!'] which is eight elements, which is more than four. So I's incorrect.

Option J is None of the above, but since F is correct, J is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B, which is ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!'], matching what we expect from the multiplication.
</think>

In Python, multiplying a list by an integer duplicates the list. Thus, `['Hi!'] * 4` results in a list with four elements, each being `['Hi!']`. 

Checking the options, option B and option H both correctly output the same result. Since the question asks for the output, the correct answer is option B.

Answer: B
