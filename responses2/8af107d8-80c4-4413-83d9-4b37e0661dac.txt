Question:

When estimating the total number of Calories required by a personin a day, we consider such factors as sex, amount of activity, and the temperature in which the person lives. Why arethese factors necessary?

Options:

A: Caloric requirements are only influenced by the environmental temperature, not by sex or activity level.
B: Temperature has no effect on caloric requirements.
C: Each person's Caloric requirement differs according to sex, amount of activity and environmental temperature.
D: Caloric requirements are determined by age and sex only, without taking into account activity level or temperature.
E: Only the sex of the person matters for caloric requirements.
F: Caloric requirements are determined by a fixed formula that applies universally, regardless of individual differences.
G: Caloric requirements decrease with increased activity and are independent of sex or environmental factors.
H: Caloric requirement is the same for everyone.
I: Caloric requirements increase only with the amount of activity and are unaffected by sex or temperature.
J: Caloric requirements are solely based on an individual's weight and height, with no consideration for sex, activity, or temperature.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about why certain factors like sex, activity, and temperature are important when estimating the total Calories needed each day. Let me think this through step by step.

The question asks why these factors are necessary. The options are A to J. First, I'll try to understand each factor:

1. **Sex**: I remember that men and women have different caloric needs. For example, women might burn more fat and use more energy in certain activities. So, sex is a big factor.

2. **Activity Level**: People who are active (like athletes or people who exercise) will consume more calories than those who are less active. So activity definitely plays a role.

3. **Environmental Temperature**: I recall that body temperature affects metabolic rate. Higher body temperature might increase metabolic activity, leading to more calories burned. So, the environment's temperature is a key factor.

Now, looking at the options:

- **Option A**: Says Caloric needs are only influenced by temperature. But I know it's not just temperature; sex and activity are also important. So A is incorrect.

- **Option B**: Says temperature has no effect. Definitely wrong because higher temps usually increase energy expenditure.

- **Option C**: Claims each person's needs differ based on sex, activity, and temperature. That sounds right because all these factors can change a person's caloric requirements.

- **Option D**: Talks about age and sex only. But the question includes activity and temperature, so D is incorrect.

- **Option E**: Says sex is the only factor. No, because activity and temperature are also important, so E is wrong.

- **Option F**: States it's a fixed formula. That's not how it works; it's person-specific based on factors.

- **Option G**: Claims requirements decrease with activity. No, activity is directly linked, so this is not correct.

- **Option H**: Says requirements increase with activity and are independent of sex or temp. That's not right because all three factors are variables that influence it.

- **Option I**: Says activity increases requirements, unaffected by sex or temp. No, all three are important.

- **Option J**: Talks about weight and height. I don't think that's correct because factors like sex, activity, and environment are more relevant. Weight can vary, but it's not the sole determinant.

So, the correct answer should be C, which states that each person's needs vary based on sex, activity, and environmental temperature. All three are important factors influencing caloric needs.

The correct answer is C: Each person's Caloric requirement differs according to sex, amount of activity, and environmental temperature. These factors are crucial because they significantly influence metabolic rate and energy expenditure, making them essential for accurate estimation.

Answer: C
