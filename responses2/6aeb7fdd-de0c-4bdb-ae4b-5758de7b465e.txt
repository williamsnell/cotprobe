Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Australia during the Holocene epoch. The question is asking what Australia has in common with the rest of the world at that time. Let me think through each option.

First, I need to recall what the Holocene epoch is. It's the last Ice Age, from about 114 million to 141 million years ago. During this time, a lot of the Earth's ecosystems were affected, leading to changes in the environment and societies.

Looking at the options:

A: emergence of complex social hierarchies and political systems. I remember that in the past, different societies had different structures. Australia might have had some complex hierarchies, maybe influenced by other regions like Europe or Africa. But I'm not sure if this was common in the entire world then.

B: growth in cultural diversity. From what I know, there were definitely lots of cultural developments, like pottery, writing systems, and trade. But was this the case for Australia specifically compared to other regions? Or was this a global trend that evolved over time?

C: Formation of a single global civilization. That doesn't sound right. I thought the world was fragmented, with distinct civilizations. Australia was part of that, but it wasn't the only one. Also, maybe some regions were more advanced than others.

D: Onset of a new ice age. That's the opposite of what the question is asking. Australia would not have the new ice age; that would have come later.

E: Introduction of farming. I know that farming did start a bit later, maybe with European colonization. Australia wasn't really colonized until much later, so I don't think that's accurate.

F: Complete extinction of megafauna. That sounds like a completely different scenario. Megafauna include things like whales, bears, et al. Australia's ecosystems were definitely more diverse, so this doesn't fit.

G: Independent domestication of wheat and cattle. I'm pretty sure that wheat and cattle were domesticated in Australia. That was a big domestication event, which allowed agriculture to spread. So this seems likely.

Putting it all together, the common feature is the domestication of crops, which would make option G the correct answer.

The correct answer is G: the independent domestication of wheat and cattle.

Answer: G
