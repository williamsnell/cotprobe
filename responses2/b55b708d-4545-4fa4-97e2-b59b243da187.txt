Okay, so I've got this question here about two statements regarding neural networks and machine learning. Hmm. Let me try to think through each part step by step.

The first statement says that RELUs are not monotonic, but sigmoids are. I remember that RELU stands for Rectified Linear Unit. Monotonic functions are ones that either always increase or always decrease. But wait, RELU has a problem with gradient. Oh right! Because when the input is negative, the derivative is zero. So the function doesn't have a consistent increase or decrease. It's like a flat spot for negative values, which means it's not strictly increasing or decreasing. So that makes sense why it's not monotonic.

Sigmoid functions, on the other hand, are smooth and have a clear slope that always increases. The derivative is always positive, so they are strictly increasing. That makes them monotonic. So statement 1 seems to be true.

Now, the second statement is about neural networks trained with gradient descent and high probability converging to the global optimum. Wait, I remember that gradient descent is an iterative method that can get stuck in local minima, especially in complex loss landscapes. So the idea that it will always find the global minimum with high probability is probably not correct. I think that the convergence is more likely to be to a local minimum, not necessarily the global one. So statement 2 might be false.

Putting it together, statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false. So looking at the options, statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false.

Let me check the options:

A: True, False → This matches what I'm thinking.

B: True, True → No, statement 2 is false.

C: Both partially true → No, both are facts.

D: Statement 1 can't be determined; 2 is false → I don't think statement 1 is undetermined because I know it's true.

E: Both can't be determined → No, because statement 1 is true.

F: Both false → No, statement 1 is true.

G: Statement 1 is false, 2 can't be determined → No, 1 is true.

H: 1 can't be determined, 2 is true → No, 1 is true, 2 is false.

I: 1 is true, 2 can't be determined → No, 2 is false.

J: 1 is false, 2 is true → No, 1 is true.

So the correct answer should be option A: True, False.

The first statement is true because RELUs are not monotonic, while sigmoids are. The second statement is false because neural networks don't necessarily converge to the global optimum. 

Answer: A: True, False
