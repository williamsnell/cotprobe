Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question here. Let me see what it's about. The question is about an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas. Hmm, I remember that isothermal means the temperature stays constant. Right, so the process is at a constant temperature. 

The question says the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings. Wait, I think work done by the gas is positive work, right? So W is positive. But since it's an expansion, the gas is doing work on the surroundings, so positive work.

Now, the process is isothermal, so the internal energy change should be zero. Because for ideal gases, ΔU is zero at constant temperature. Oh wait, that's the first law of thermodynamics, right? ΔU = Q + W. But since ΔU is zero, Q must equal -W. But wait, wait, no. Let me get that straight.

The first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So in an expansion, the system does work, so W is positive. So if the gas is doing work, then Q would be the heat added to the system. But wait, since ΔU is zero, Q = W.

Wait, wait no. Let me think again. Suppose the system (the gas) is doing work on the surroundings. So the work W is positive, and the system is losing energy as work. Since ΔU is zero, Q must be equal to -W. But wait, that would mean Q is negative, which implies the system is losing heat. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me structure this. The first law is:

ΔU = Q - W,

where W is the work done by the system. So if the system does work (like expansion), W is positive. Since the gas is expanding, it's doing work. And for isothermal processes, ΔU is zero. So 0 = Q - W. So Q = W. 

So here, W is 150 J. So Q would be 150 J. But wait, that's heat added to the system. Because if the system is doing work, it must be absorbing heat. So the gas is gaining heat, so Q is positive.

Wait, but I've got to make sure about the signs. Let me double-check. In one convention, work done by the system is positive and heat absorbed is positive, so ΔU = Q - W. So if system does work, W is positive. So for an isothermal process, ΔU is zero. So Q must be equal to W. 

Wait, so Q is positive 150 J. So that would mean 150 J of heat is added to the gas. So the gas absorbs heat, so the heat transfer Q is positive.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the process again. When a gas expands isothermally, it’s doing work. The gas is losing internal energy (since ΔU is zero), so it must be absorbing heat. So yes, Q is positive.

So the gas is receiving heat. So looking at the options, option A is 150 J added. That would mean Q is positive. So the correct answer is A.

Now, let me look at the options. The choices are:

A: 150 J of heat added.
B: 300 J added.
C: 200 J added.
D: 75 J removed.
E: No heat.
F: 250 J added.
G: 200 J removed.
H: 75 J added.
I: 300 J removed.
J: 150 J removed.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The question involves an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, where the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings. For an isothermal process, the internal energy change (ΔU) is zero because the temperature remains constant. According to the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]

where \( Q \) is the heat transfer and \( W \) is the work done by the system. Since \( \Delta U = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
Q = W
\]

Here, \( W = 150 \, \text{J} \), so \( Q = 150 \, \text{J} \). This indicates that 150 J of heat is added to the gas. 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is **A: 150 J of heat was added to the gas**.
