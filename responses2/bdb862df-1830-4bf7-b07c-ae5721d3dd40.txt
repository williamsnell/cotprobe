Question:

Two brothers who were in need of money approached their wealthy uncle's housekeeper and asked her to poison him. The brothers would inherit the uncle's estate when he died. The housekeeper agreed, but on the condition that they would pay her $10,000 from their inheritance. After the brothers agreed to her demand, the housekeeper decided to place some cyanide in the uncle's tea one morning. As the housekeeper was preparing the tea, the uncle was visited by his personal physician. When the housekeeper was ready to serve the tea, the uncle asked her to fix some tea for his physician also. The housekeeper did so and then carefully set the tea on the table so that the uncle's cup was facing him. However, when the physician reached over to get some sugar, he inadvertently took the uncle's cup with the cyanide and drank it. Seconds later, the physician died from the poison. Which of the following crimes are the brothers guilty of?

Options:

A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.
B: Murder of both their uncle and the physician.
C: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.
D: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician.
E: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle and the physician.
F: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the housekeeper.
G: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.
H: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.
I: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle only.
J: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about criminal law, specifically about the crimes that the brothers could be guilty of. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the scenario is about two brothers who needed money and approached their uncle's housekeeper to poison him. The housekeeper agreed but would pay $10,000 in return. They agreed to this, so the housekeeper puts cyanide in the uncle's tea one morning. When the brothers agreed, the uncle's physician visited. The housekeeper prepared the tea, and then she set it so the uncle was facing it. But then, the physician accidentally took the cup with cyanide and drank it. The physician died from that.

The question is about which crimes the brothers are guilty of. The options are A through J, each a combination of different crimes.

Let me think about the possible crimes involved here. The key here is the actions of the housekeeper and the consequences of her actions.

First, the brothers requested money from their uncle. The housekeeper agreed, but she took money from their inheritance. So, this seems like solicitation of funds. That's a crime, right? They were providing money, and the housekeeper took their money. So that's a first degree or second degree? Well, if they're providing money and the housekeeper is accepting it, that's a solicitation.

Wait, but the houses are involved. The uncle's estate, the uncle's physician, and the housekeeper's business—maybe that's another angle. But the immediate point here is the brothers requesting money and the housekeeper taking it.

So, the brothers are involved in the requesting of funds. They might be considered as the solicitation for the uncle. So that's one crime: solicitation.

Then, the housekeeper put cyanide in the tea. That's a classic murder. So, she did the murder. But wait, did she kill the physician? Because the physician drank the cup with the cyanide, presumably after the cup was placed on the table. So the housekeeper committed murder while serving the tea. That's the murder of the physician.

But hold on, the housekeeper was the one who prepared the tea. She was in the uncle's estate, so perhaps she's also considered involved in the murder. Or is the murder separate?

Hmm, the situation is that the housekeeper put cyanide into the tea, which the physician drank. So she was the one committing the murder. But wait, the brothers might also be involved in the murder.

Wait, let me think again. The uncle's physician visited the brothers. The housekeeper was responsible for the tea. She placed the poison, and the physician drank it. So, the murder is the housekeeper's doing. But what about the brothers' actions? Did they interfere in the process? The brothers were the ones who approached the housekeeper, so they might have done something wrong by providing the money. So, did they have any other crimes?

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are responsible for the murder because they were the ones who approached the housekeeper. So, as the ones who approached, they could be considered as a participant in the murder.

Wait, but the housekeeper's action is the murder. So the murder is a separate crime from what the brothers did. But the brothers might be responsible for the murder as a result of their actions—like, perhaps, the brothers themselves caused the murder by providing the money.

Wait, no. Because the brothers were approached by the uncle's housekeeper, who then took their money. So the brothers are the ones who requested the money. So, is the brothers' solicitation included here?

Wait, let me clarify. The brothers are the ones requesting the money. The housekeeper is the one who agreed but took it. So, the brothers could be considered as the ones who provided the money, which is a form of solicitation. So that's a first-degree or second-degree murder?

Well, the situation is that the brothers (as the parties requesting the money) are the ones who are being asked to provide the funds. So, the brothers might be charged with solicitation. Because they were providing the money, and the housekeeper took it, that's a form of solicitation.

So, the brothers could be guilty of solicitation of funds, which is a crime. Then, the housekeeper committed murder by placing cyanide in the tea, which the physician drank. So, the murder is separate.

But wait, the options include combinations of different crimes. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and attempted murder of physician.

Option E: Conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and attempt to murder physician.

So, the brothers might be responsible for the murder because they were involved in the process. Wait, no. Because the brothers were the ones who approached the housekeeper. The housekeeper's actions led to the murder. So, perhaps the brothers are not the ones responsible for the murder. Or are they?

Alternatively, maybe the brothers are the culprits. Because, for example, when the brothers approached the housekeeper, they might have had a reason to provide the money, but perhaps the situation caused the housekeeper to take it, putting the brothers in a position where they could have committed the murder themselves. But that's probably stretching it.

Wait, maybe the brothers' actions are not directly responsible for the murder. Or perhaps the brothers are the ones who were in the same boat as the uncle, but the situation led to the housekeeper taking the money. Hmm, perhaps the situation puts the brothers in a position where they could have committed the murder themselves if they had acted differently.

Wait, but the brothers were approached by the uncle's housekeeper. If the uncle was using the housekeeper to obtain money, the housekeeper might have been acting in someone else's interest. So, the brothers, perhaps, didn't know that and were in need of money themselves, which could have led them to act in a way that caused the housekeeper to take their money. So, they might be responsible for the murder because they were in the same boat and the situation led to the murder. Or perhaps the brothers' actions, together with the situation, led to the murder.

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are not directly responsible for the murder. The only direct action they took is providing the money, which is a solicitation. The housekeeper's actions (murder) are separate from their actions. But if the brothers were in the position to kill the physician, perhaps they could have, but that's more about their own actions.

Wait, but in the scenario, the brothers approached the housekeeper, and the housekeeper took their money. So, their own actions are the solicitation, while the housekeeper's actions are murder. So, the brothers are guilty of solicitation, and the housekeeper is guilty of murder.

But looking at the options, the possible options are:

Option A: solicitation, murder of uncle, attempt murder of physician.

Option E: murder of uncle, attempt murder of physician.

Wait, no. The options don't have both the uncle's and the physician's murder. Let me check each option.

Option A: solicitation, conspiracy to murder uncle, attempt murder of physician.

Option E: conspiracy to murder uncle, attempt murder of physician.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.

B: Murder of both.

C: Conspiracy to murder uncle, murder of physician.

D: Solicitation, conspiracy to murder uncle, involuntary manslaughter of physician.

E: Conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, attempt to murder physician.

Wait, let me re-express the options:

E: Conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and attempt to kill the physician.

Wait, if the brothers are responsible for the murder, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are not directly responsible for the murder but are just the ones who were approached, making them the culprits in the murder.

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are the ones who were part of the situation leading to the murder. For example, if the uncle's estate was being preserved, the brothers might have been in a position to kill the physician, but that doesn't align with the facts.

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are not directly responsible for the murder, but the situation (the housekeeper's actions) and the brothers' actions led to the murder. But that would be more about the actions of the housekeeper, not the brothers.

Wait, the brothers are the ones who approached the housekeeper and were in need of money. The housekeeper agreed but took the money. So, perhaps the brothers were the ones who wanted to get the money, but the situation led them to take it. So, the brothers' own actions (solicitation) and the housekeeper's actions (murder) are separate.

So, the brothers are guilty of solicitation. The housekeeper is guilty of murder. So, which options include this?

Looking at the options:

Option A: solicitation, conspiracy to kill uncle, attempt to kill physician.

Option E: conspiracy to kill uncle, attempt to kill physician.

Wait, neither E nor A include the housekeeper's murder. Option E includes the uncle's murder and attempt to kill the physician.

Wait, but the brothers are the ones who approached the housekeeper. The situation led to the housekeeper taking money, which is a form of murder. So, the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves. Instead, the situation caused the housekeeper to take the money, which led to the physician drinking cyanide. So, the brothers are not directly responsible for the murder.

But then, is the murder of the physician a separate crime from the brothers' actions?

Hmm, perhaps the brothers are not directly responsible for the murder. So, the only direct criminal action is the solicitation. But let's think about the options again.

Option B: murder of both. Maybe the brothers are to blame for the murder.

Wait, if the brothers are in the same boat as the uncle, and the uncle's actions (using the housekeeper) led to the brothers being in a position to kill the physician, perhaps the brothers are guilty of murder because they were the ones who were in the same boat. So, the situation caused the uncle's death, leading the brothers to be in the position to kill the physician.

But is that a reasonable basis? The situation could be considered a mutual arrangement, and the brothers being the culprits would be a conspiracy.

But I'm not sure. The question states that the brothers approached the housekeeper to poison him. So, perhaps the brothers were the ones in the same boat, and the uncle's death was a result of the situation. So, perhaps the brothers are responsible for the murder of the physician.

Wait, but the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves, but the situation led to the housekeeper taking the money, which allowed the brothers to be in the position to kill the physician.

Alternatively, maybe the brothers' actions, together with the situation, led to the murder. But I'm not sure if that's a common law consideration. Alternatively, it's possible that the brothers are the culprits because they were part of the situation that led to the murder.

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are not directly involved in the murder but are the ones who are now in a position to kill the physician. So, the murder of the physician is a separate crime, and the brothers are the culprits.

Wait, but the options don't include both the uncle and the physician in the same option. Let me look again:

Looking at the options:

Option E: conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and attempt to kill the physician.

But the options don't have the option that includes killing the physician directly. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the brothers are both the ones who were approached (solicitation) and the ones who committed the murder (mutual), leading to the physician's death. So, that would be a conspiracy.

Wait, in that case, the brothers would be guilty of conspiracy to commit murder of uncle. But the options don't have that option either.

Looking again, the options:

Option A: solicitation, conspiracy to kill uncle, attempt to kill physician.

Option E: conspiracy to kill uncle, attempt to kill physician.

Hmm, perhaps the brothers are guilty of the murder of the uncle and the attempt to kill the physician. Wait, but the brothers didn't attempt to kill the physician; they were just the ones who were in the position. So, perhaps the attempt is not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are not guilty of the murder of the uncle, but the situation led to the uncle's death, so the brothers could have been the ones to kill him. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the brothers are the culprits because they were the ones who were in the same boat as the uncle and the situation led to the uncle's death, so the brothers were the ones to kill the uncle and the physician. So, perhaps the brothers are guilty of murder of uncle and attempt to kill the physician.

But the options don't have that. Let's re-examine the options.

Wait, perhaps the situation is that the uncle's estate was being preserved, so the brothers were in a position to kill the physician. So, perhaps the brothers are the culprits, leading to the murder of the physician.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try to think of the elements of each crime:

1. Solicitation: The brothers approached the housekeeper and asked for money. So, that's a form of solicitation.

2. Murder: The housekeeper placed cyanide in the tea, which the physician drank. So, that's murder.

But the brothers are not directly responsible for the murder. Or are they? Because the situation led to them being in a position to kill the physician.

Wait, but the housekeeper's actions are the direct cause of the murder. The brothers' actions are merely the ones who approached. So, the brothers are not directly responsible for the murder.

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are the culprits because they were the ones who were in the position to kill the physician. So, the brothers are the ones who committed the murder.

But in that case, the brothers would be guilty of murder, but the options don't have that as a separate crime. So, looking at the options, which include the uncle's murder.

Wait, option B is murder of both, C is conspiracy to kill uncle and murder of physician, D includes solicitation, and E is conspiracy to kill uncle and attempt to kill physician.

Wait, perhaps the brothers are guilty of the murder of the uncle and the attempt to kill the physician. But the options don't have that as a combination. So, perhaps none of the options directly address this.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and attempt murder of physician.

B: Murder of both.

C: Conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and murder of physician.

D: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of physician.

E: conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and attempt to kill the physician.

Hmm, the correct scenario is that the brothers are in the position to kill the physician, but their actions didn't result in the physician's death. So, perhaps they are not directly responsible for the murder of the physician.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation caused the uncle's death, so the brothers were in a position to kill him, so the brothers are the culprits, leading to the uncle's death and the physician's death. But that's stretching it.

Wait, but the brothers were the ones who approached the housekeeper. If the uncle's estate was being preserved, the brothers were in a position to kill the physician, perhaps. So, perhaps the brothers are the culprits. So, the brothers are guilty of murder of the uncle and attempt to kill the physician. But the options don't have that as an option.

Wait, looking back:

Option A: solicitation, conspiracy to kill uncle, attempt to kill physician.

Option E: conspiracy to kill uncle, attempt to kill physician.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of both the uncle's murder and the physician's murder. But I don't think that's right because the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves.

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.

The key point is the situation: the brothers approached the housekeeper, who agreed to take the money but refused, leading to the housekeeper taking it. The housekeeper then put cyanide in the tea, which the physician drank, killing him.

So, the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves. The situation led to the housekeeper's death, and thus, the brothers were in a position to kill the physician. But I think in criminal law, the act of placing cyanide in the tea would be considered murder, regardless of whether the person killed. So, the housekeeper is guilty of murder, but the brothers are not directly responsible for the murder of the physician.

But looking at the options, the only one that includes the murder of the uncle is options A and C.

Now, what about the attempt to kill the physician? The brothers didn't attempt to do that; they just approached. So, the attempt is not applicable.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder, but that's not an option in the given choices.

Wait, perhaps another angle. The brothers were approached by the uncle's housekeeper, who agreed to give the money but refused. The housekeeper took the money, leading to the housekeeper's death. So, the brothers were in a position to kill the physician, but perhaps they didn't do that. So, perhaps the only direct criminal action is the solicitation of money, which is a first-degree crime.

But the options include both the uncle and the physician.

Wait, perhaps the brothers are the culprits because they were the ones who were in the same boat as the uncle and the situation led to the uncle's death, so the brothers were in a position to kill him. But I'm not sure if that's a common law consideration.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation caused the uncle's death, so the brothers were the culprits in the murder of the uncle. So, that would make the brothers guilty of the murder of the uncle.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes the uncle's murder is option B and option C (which refers to the uncle's murder and the physician's murder).

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the brothers are the culprits in the murder of the uncle. If that's the case, then the options would include that. So, which option includes that?

Option C states that the brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and murder of the physician.

Wait, but no, the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves. The situation led to the uncle's death, but the brothers were just the ones in the boat. So, perhaps the brothers are guilty of the murder of the uncle, but not the physician.

Wait, but that's not an option either. Looking at the options again:

Option A: solicitation, conspiracy to kill uncle, attempt to kill physician.

Option E: conspiracy to kill uncle, attempt to kill physician.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E. Because the brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and they attempt to kill the physician. But the attempt to kill the physician isn't a separate crime, so perhaps option E is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because the brothers are guilty of both the uncle's murder and the physician's murder.

But no, the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves. The situation led to the uncle's death, and the brothers were in a position to kill him. So, the brothers are guilty of the murder of the uncle, but not the physician's.

So, perhaps the correct option is E, which is conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and attempt to kill the physician. But the attempt to kill the physician is not a separate crime, so perhaps that's incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the brothers are guilty of the murder of the uncle and the attempt to kill the physician, but the attempt isn't a separate crime.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician. But in reality, the attempt isn't applicable, so perhaps the correct answer is option E, which includes both the uncle's murder and the attempt. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the situation led to the uncle's death, so the brothers were the culprits in the murder of the uncle. So, the brothers are guilty of the murder of the uncle. But the options don't have that. The closest options are A and E, which include the uncle's murder.

But the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves. So, they are not guilty of the physician's murder.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician. But the attempt isn't a separate crime, so perhaps that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are the culprits in the murder of the uncle and the attempt to kill the physician. But in reality, the attempt isn't applicable, so perhaps the correct answer is that they are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E is conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and attempt to kill the physician. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician, which would be option E.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the brothers are not guilty of the murder of the uncle, but the situation led to the uncle's death, so the brothers are the culprits in the murder of the uncle. So, the correct answer would be that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician.

But in reality, the attempt isn't applicable, so perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and murder of the physician.

But the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves, so they are not guilty of the physician's murder.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the possible correct answer.

The correct scenario is that the brothers were approached by the uncle's housekeeper, who agreed but refused to give the money. The housekeeper took the money, leading to the housekeeper's death. So, the brothers were in a position to kill the physician, but they didn't. So, perhaps the brothers are the culprits in the murder of the uncle, but not the physician.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes the uncle's murder is option B and option C.

Wait, option C says conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and murder of physician.

So, if the brothers are guilty of both the uncle's and the physician's murder, that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves. So, perhaps the correct answer is that they are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician.

But the attempt isn't a separate crime, so perhaps the correct answer is that they are guilty of the uncle's murder.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the elements.

The housekeeper's actions (murder) and the brothers' actions (approaching and possibly committing the murder of the uncle).

In criminal law, the situation where the brothers were in a position to kill the physician but didn't do so leads to them being the culprits in the murder of the uncle, but not the physician.

Wait, but the brothers are not guilty of the physician's murder, so the correct answer would not include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician.

But in reality, the attempt isn't applicable, so perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option E: conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and attempt to kill the physician.

But the attempt is not applicable, so perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician, which would be option E.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician, making option E the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician, making option E correct.

But I'm not fully confident. Let me try to approach it again.

In criminal law, the situation where the brothers were in a position to kill the physician but didn't do it leads them to be the culprits in the murder of the uncle. So, the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder.

But the options don't have any option that includes that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician, making option E correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder.

But looking at the options, option C includes the uncle's murder and the physician's murder, but that's not accurate because the brothers didn't kill the physician.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder, making the correct option C, but that's not correct because the brothers didn't kill the physician.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look for the correct answer.

Well, according to the scenario, the brothers were approached by the uncle's housekeeper, who agreed to give the money but refused. The housekeeper took the money, leading to the housekeeper's death. So, the brothers were in a position to kill the physician, but they didn't. So, perhaps the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician. But in reality, the attempt isn't applicable, so perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder.

But looking at the options, the only one that includes the uncle's murder is option B and option C.

So, I think the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician, making option E correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder.

But given that the situation led to the uncle's death and the brothers were in a position to kill the physician, perhaps the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician, which is option E.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the elements again.

To be guilty of murder, you must have the elements of the crime, which include the commission of the act (placing cyanide in the tea), the commission of the act (the act of death), and the commission of the act of causation (placing cyanide in the tea as the cause of death).

So, in this case, the brothers did not place cyanide in the tea, but the situation led to the housekeeper's death, which led the brothers to be in a position to kill the physician. But I don't think that's a sufficient basis for the brothers to be guilty of the murder of the physician.

Wait, but perhaps the situation led to the uncle's death, so the brothers were in a position to kill the physician. So, perhaps the brothers are guilty of the murder of the uncle and the attempt to kill the physician, which would be option E.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder, making option C incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of it differently.

The brothers approached the housekeeper and refused to give the money, leading to the housekeeper taking it. The housekeeper then put cyanide in the tea, which the physician drank, killing him.

So, the brothers are in a position to kill the physician. So, perhaps the brothers are guilty of the murder of the physician.

Additionally, the brothers were the ones who approached the situation, leading to the uncle's death. So, perhaps the brothers are also guilty of the murder of the uncle.

So, in option C, the brothers are guilty of both the uncle's murder and the physician's murder.

Wait, but the brothers didn't kill the physician themselves. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician, making option E correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the brothers are guilty of the uncle's murder.

Wait, I'm not sure. I think I'll go with option E, which includes both the uncle's murder and the attempt to kill the physician.
</think>

The correct answer is option E: conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and attempt to kill the physician.

**Explanation:**

1. **Solicitation of Money**: The brothers approached the housekeeper and approached the situation, leading to the housekeeper's death. This constitutes a form of solicitation and is a first-degree crime.

2. **Murder of the Murderer (Uncle)**: The brothers were in a position to kill the uncle. This is a form of murder of the uncle and is included in the options.

3. **Attempt to Kill the Physician**: The brothers were in a position to kill the physician. However, the situation led to the uncle's death, which prompted the brothers to attempt to kill the physician. This is an attempt to kill the physician and is included in the options.

4. **Conclusion**: The brothers are guilty of both the murder of the uncle and the attempt to kill the physician. This makes option E the correct answer.

ANSWER: E
