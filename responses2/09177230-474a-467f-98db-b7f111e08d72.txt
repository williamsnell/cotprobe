Answer:

Okay, so I've got this finance problem here, and I need to figure out the first monthly payment for the loan Mr. and Mrs. Golden took out. Let me read the question again.

They borrowed $18,000 at 6% interest for a 20-year term. I remember that to calculate the monthly payment on a fixed-rate loan, the formula I should use is something called the "amortization formula." I think the formula is:

M = P [ i (1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1 ]

Where:
- M is the monthly payment,
- P is the principal loan amount,
- i is the monthly interest rate,
- n is the number of payments.

So let me break it down. The principal is $18,000. The interest rate is 6% per annum, but since payments are monthly, I need to convert that to a monthly rate. 6% divided by 12 months is 0.5% per month, or 0.005 as a decimal.

The term is 20 years, so the number of monthly payments is 20 * 12 = 240 months. 

Now plugging these into the formula: 

M = 18000 [ 0.005 (1 + 0.005)^240 ] / [ (1 + 0.005)^240 - 1 ]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can compute each part step by step.

First, calculate (1 + i), which is 1.005. Then, I need to raise that to the power of 240. Let me think—what's 1.005^240? I don't remember the exact value, but I can estimate it or use a calculator. Wait, I remember that for larger exponents, you can use logarithms or approximate, but perhaps I should just recall the formula.

Alternatively, I can compute the numerator and denominator separately.

The numerator is 0.005 * (1.005)^240. Let's call (1.005)^240 equal to X. So numerator is 0.005X.

Denominator is X - 1.

So the formula becomes M = 18000 * (0.005X) / (X - 1).

But without knowing X, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for monthly payments or look up a standard table. Wait, I remember that for a fixed-rate loan, the monthly payment can be calculated using the present value annuity formula.

Wait, I think another way to compute the monthly payment is using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of months.

So if I rearrange that to solve for PMT:

PMT = PV / [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] = (PV * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

So let me compute that.

PV is $18,000, r is 0.005, n is 240.

So numerator: 18000 * 0.005 = 90.00.

Denominator: 1 - (1.005)^-240.

Wait, what is (1.005)^-240? That's the same as 1/(1.005)^240. I think that's a small number. Let me compute it approximately.

Wait, 1.005^240 is e^(240 ln 1.005). Let's compute ln(1.005): approximately 0.004979 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 for small x). So 0.004979 *240 = about 1.195. So e^1.195 is approximately 3.303. So (1.005)^240 ≈ 3.303. Therefore, (1.005)^-240 ≈ 1/3.303 ≈ 0.3029.

So denominator is 1 - 0.3029 = 0.6971.

So PMT = 90.00 / 0.6971 ≈ 127.55.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is $128.96, and this is approximately that. So the first payment is roughly $128.96.

Alternatively, I could have used the present value formula. But maybe I should confirm the exact calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can use the formula for the monthly payment another way.

Alternatively, I can think about the present value of the loan. The loan amount is $18,000, which is the present value of the 240 monthly payments.

So PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We have PV = 18000, r=0.005, n=240. So solve for PMT.

PMT = PV * r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

So as before, let's compute each part.

Compute 1 + r = 1.005.

Compute (1.005)^240. Let's compute it more accurately. Maybe I can use logarithms.

ln(1.005) = approximately 0.004979.

Multiply by 240: 0.004979 *240 = let me compute 0.004979 * 200 = 0.9958, and 0.004979 *40= 0.19916, so total is 1.19496.

So e^1.19496 ≈ e^1.195. Since e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.195 = approximately 1.216. So 2.71828 *1.216 ≈ 3.304. So (1.005)^240 ≈ 3.304.

Thus, (1.005)^-240 = 1/3.304 ≈ 0.3027.

Denominator: 1 - 0.3027 = 0.6973.

So numerator: 18000 * 0.005 = 90.

So PMT = 90 / 0.6973 ≈ 127.55.

Wait, 90 divided by 0.6973: 0.6973 * 127 is about 90? Let me check 0.6973 * 127.

127 * 0.7 = 88.9, so 0.6973*127 ≈ 127*(0.7 - 0.0027) = 88.9 - 0.3429 ≈ 88.557. That's less than 90. So 127.55 would be approximately (127.55 * 0.6973) ≈ 90.

So 127.55 is the monthly payment.

Looking at the options, option B is $128.96, which is close but a bit higher than our calculation. Hmm... maybe I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of (1.005)^240. Let me think of it as (1.005)^240. Maybe using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can use a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact value using the formula:

ln(1.005) = 0.00497901.

Multiply by 240: 0.00497901 *240 = let's compute 0.00497901 * 200 = 0.995802, and 0.00497901 *40 = 0.1991604. Total is 1.1949624.

e^1.1949624 = e^(1.1949624). Let me compute that. Let me think of it as e^(1.1949624) = e^(1 + 0.1949624) = e * e^0.1949624.

e^0.1949624 is approximately, since e^0.19 is about 1.209, and e^0.2 is about 1.2214. So 0.1949624 is about 0.195. So e^0.195 ≈ 1.216.

So then e^1.1949624 ≈ e * 1.216 ≈ 2.71828 *1.216 ≈ let's compute that.

2.71828 *1 = 2.71828.

2.71828 *0.2 = 0.543656.

2.71828 *0.016 = 0.04349248.

Add those: 2.71828 + 0.543656 = 3.261936 + 0.04349248 = 3.305428.

So (1.005)^240 ≈ 3.305428.

Thus, (1.005)^-240 ≈ 1 /3.305428 ≈ 0.30256.

So denominator: 1 - 0.30256 = 0.69744.

So now, PMT = (18000 * 0.005) / 0.69744.

18000 *0.005 is 90.

So 90 / 0.69744 ≈ let me compute that.

90 ÷0.69744.

Let me compute 0.69744 × 127.5 = ?

0.69744 * 120 = 83.6928.

0.69744 *7.5 = 5.2308.

Total: 83.6928 +5.2308= 88.9236.

That's less than 90. So 127.5 would give 88.9236. We need 90, so we need 1.0764 more.

Each additional 0.01 in the payment increases the total by 0.69744 * 0.01 = 0.0069744 per 0.01. Wait, no: wait, 0.69744 × 0.01 = 0.0069744. So to get 1.0764 over 88.9236, each 1 unit of payment adds 0.69744. So:

1.0764 / 0.69744 ≈ 1.544.

So 127.5 + 1.544 = 129.044. Hmm, that's higher than our earlier estimate.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier and the correct value is around $128.96.

Wait, let me think. Let me use a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can input the exact calculation into a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the monthly payment for a $18,000 loan at 6% for 20 years is about $128.96. So option B is $128.96, which would make sense.

So looking at the options, option B is $128.96, which is the correct first payment.

Wait, but earlier I was calculating 90 / 0.69744 = about 127.55. But the correct answer is $128.96, which is higher. So why is that?

Ah, because perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.005)^240 accurately. Let me compute the natural log approach again.

ln(1.005) = 0.004979012.

Multiply by 240: 0.004979012 * 240 = 1.19496288.

So e^1.19496288 is approximately ?

Wait, e^1 is about 2.71828, e^0.19496288 is ?

Well, 0.19496288 is approximately 0.195, so e^0.195 ≈ ?

Using the Taylor series for e^x around x=0: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6.

x=0.195.

x^2 =0.038025, divided by 2 is 0.0190125.

x^3=0.00741375, divided by6 is 0.001235625.

So e^0.195 ≈ 1 + 0.195 + 0.0190125 + 0.001235625 ≈ 1.215248.

Multiply by e^1 (2.71828) gives:

2.71828 * 1.215248 ≈ let me compute.

2 * 1.215248 = 2.430496.

0.71828 *1.215248 ≈ ?

0.7 *1.215248=0.8506736.

0.01828 *1.215248 ≈approx 0.02216.

So total is 0.8506736 + 0.02216 ≈ 0.8728336.

So 2.430496 + 0.8728336 ≈ 3.3033296.

So (1.005)^240 ≈3.3033296.

Thus, (1.005)^-240 is ≈1/3.3033296 ≈0.3028.

So denominator: 1 - 0.3028=0.6972.

So numerator: 18000 *0.005=90.

So PMT=90/0.6972≈127.55.

Wait, earlier calculation says approximately $127.55, but the options have B as $128.96. That's about $1.41 difference. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would give a higher number.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, $128.96, which is a standard approximation for a 18k loan at 6% for 20 years.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately using a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the monthly payment using the formula and maybe the exact value is $128.96.

Wait, perhaps I can use a better approximation. Let me think of the formula:

M = P [ r (1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator or another method. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for monthly payment:

M = P * [ (r (1 + r)^n ) / ( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) ]

r=0.005, n=240.

So let's compute (1.005)^240.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as follows:

Using the formula, (1.005)^240 = e^(240 * ln(1.005)).

ln(1.005)=0.004979012.

240 *0.004979012=1.19496288.

e^1.19496288= ?

Wait, e^1.19496288 is e^{1 + 0.19496288} = e * e^0.19496288.

e^0.19496288: approx 1.216.

So e^1.19496288= e *1.216≈2.71828 *1.216≈3.3033.

So (1.005)^240≈3.3033.

Thus, 1/(3.3033)=0.3028.

So now, PMT= (18000 *0.005)/(1-0.3028) = 90 / 0.6972 ≈ 127.55.

But option B is $128.96, so perhaps the exact calculation is higher. Maybe I should use more precise intermediate steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, another approach: the monthly payment can be calculated as M = P * [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ]^{-1} * r.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact value using a series expansion or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as the present value of an ordinary annuity, where the present value PV is 18000, the rate is 6% per annum, so 0.5% per month, and the number of periods is 240.

So PV = PMT * [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] / r.

So rearranging, PMT= PV * r / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ].

So let's compute (1 + r)^n = (1.005)^240. Let's compute that accurately.

Using a calculator, I can compute (1.005)^240.

Wait, 1.005^240 is approximately 3.308. So (1.005)^240≈3.308.

So [ (1.005)^240 - 1 ] = 2.308.

So denominator is 2.308.

So PMT = 18000 *0.005 / 2.308.

Wait, 0.005 is 0.005, so 18000 *0.005=90.

So PMT=90 /2.308≈38.88. Wait, that's way less than 128.96. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in this setup, PMT is the monthly payment, and the present value of the annuity is PV = PMT * [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] /r.

Wait, so if I have PV = 18000, and I need to find PMT, then PMT= PV * r / [ (1 + r)^n -1 ].

So, PMT=18000 *0.005 / (3.308 -1) = 90 /2.308≈38.88. That's incorrect because PMT should be $128.96.

Wait, I think I have a misunderstanding here. Let me think of the formula again.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] / r.

So rearranged, PMT = PV * r / [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ].

So if I have PV=18000, r=0.005, n=240, then:

PMT = 18000 *0.005 / [ (1.005)^240 -1 ].

So compute denominator:

(1.005)^240 =3.308 approximately. So (1.005)^240 -1 =2.308.

So PMT= (18000 *0.005) /2.308=90/2.308= approx 38.88.

But that's way too low, so I must be making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me look it up again.

Ah, I think I have made a mistake. The present value of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 + r)^n -1 ] / r.

So, given PV, to find PMT, it's:

PMT = PV * r / [ (1 + r)^n -1 ].

So in this case, PV=18000, so PMT=18000 *0.005 / [ (1.005)^240 -1 ].

Which is 90/2.308≈38.88.

But that's incorrect, because the first payment is supposed to be about $128.96. So perhaps I should have used a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is for the present value of an annuity due, not an ordinary annuity.

Wait, perhaps I should use the annuity due formula. The present value of an annuity due is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 + r)^n -1 ] / r * (1 + r).

Wait, perhaps that's incorrect. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT * [ 1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

Which is what I used earlier.

So in that case, the first payment is $127.55, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B, $128.96.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the first payment is PMT, and the present value is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 + r)^n -1 ] /r.

Thus, to find PMT, it's PV / [ (1 + r)^n -1 ] * r.

So, PMT= PV * r / [ (1 + r)^n -1 ].

Which is exactly what I did earlier.

So, I think I did the correct calculation, but the answer is approximately $127.55, but the closest option is $128.96.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (1.005)^240 using a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a series expansion to approximate (1.005)^240.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as:

ln(1.005)=0.004979012.

Multiply by 240: 0.004979012 *240=1.19496288.

Now, e^1.19496288=?

Hmm, e^1.19496288 is approximately?

Let me compute e^1.19496288 using the Taylor series.

Let me compute e^x around x=1.19496288.

But perhaps it's easier to use the fact that e^(1.19496288) = e^(1 + 0.19496288) = e * e^0.19496288.

As before, e^0.19496288 can be approximated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for e^x.

Well, perhaps it's easier to just accept that the first payment is $127.55, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B, $128.96. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute (1.005)^240 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator to compute the exact value.

Wait, but since I can't do that, perhaps I can accept that the first payment is approximately $127.55, which is not one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, $128.96.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct payment is $128.96, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the monthly payment using the formula:

M = P [ r (1 + r)^n / ( (1 + r)^n -1 ) ]

Wait, perhaps I can compute that.

So, M = 18000 * [ 0.005 * (1.005)^240 / ( (1.005)^240 -1 ) ]

We have:

(1.005)^240 ≈3.308.

So numerator: 0.005 *3.308≈0.01654.

Denominator:3.308 -1=2.308.

So M=18000 * (0.01654)/2.308.

Compute 0.01654 /2.308 ≈0.00716.

Multiply by 18000: 18000 *0.00716=128.88.

So approximately $128.88, which is close to option B, $128.96.

Thus, the correct answer is option B.
</think>

To calculate the monthly payment for a $18,000 loan with a 6% annual interest rate over 20 years, we use the formula for the monthly payment of an amortized loan:

\[
M = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$18,000 \) (principal loan amount),
- \( r = 0.005 \) (monthly interest rate, 6% annual rate divided by 12),
- \( n = 240 \) (total number of monthly payments, 20 years × 12 months).

Plugging in the values:

\[
M = 18000 \times \frac{0.005 \times (1 + 0.005)^{240}}{(1 + 0.005)^{240} - 1}
\]

Calculating \( (1 + 0.005)^{240} \approx 3.308 \):

\[
M = 18000 \times \frac{0.005 \times 3.308}{3.308 - 1}
\]

\[
M = 18000 \times \frac{0.01654}{2.308}
\]

\[
M = 18000 \times 0.00716 \approx 128.88
\]

Thus, the first monthly payment is approximately $128.96, which matches option B.

ANSWER: B
