Okay, so I've got this question about the government budget and the Federal Reserve's actions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says that the government has a budget deficit of $30 billion. So, that means the government is spending more than it's earning, resulting in a negative government budget. The FED, the Federal Reserve, doesn't want to increase the money supply by more than $40 billion. I need to figure out by how much the national debt must increase, given that the legal reserve requirement is 20%.

Wait, I remember that the money supply is related to the monetary base and the reserve requirements. Let me think. The money multiplier is how much the money supply can expand given the reserve requirement. The reserve requirement (RR) is 20%, which is 0.2 in decimal. The money multiplier formula is 1/rr. So in this case, 1/0.2 is 5. So the money multiplier is 5.

But wait, the FED wants the money supply to increase by no more than $40 billion. Hmm, so if the money supply is M, then the change in M (ΔM) is 40 billion. But how does that relate to the money multiplier?

Alternatively, the money multiplier (M) is the factor by which the monetary base (MB) affects the money supply. The formula is M = MB × multiplier. So if MB is the monetary base, and M is the money supply, then MB = M / multiplier.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I might have it reversed. The money supply (M) is equal to the monetary base (MB) multiplied by the money multiplier. So M = MB * (1/rr). So MB = M / (1/rr) = M * rr. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if MB increases, M increases, but the question is about the required increase in the national debt.

Alternatively, maybe we're looking at the relationship between the budget deficit and the money creation. The government spending leads to a deficit, which is a negative balance of payments, and this can be used to create money via the banking system's lending and deposit creation.

Wait, another approach: The government's budget deficit is $30 billion. This represents a negative debt. The FED is concerned about the money supply increasing too much, but it wants to keep it within $40 billion. So the money supply might be a target, and the government is trying to manage the debt in a way that the money supply doesn't balloon beyond what the Fed wants.

I think the key is using the concept that the money multiplier is 5, as before. So for each dollar of reserves, the monetary base can expand. But the government's deficit is a source of liquidity. How much money can the banking system create from this deficit?

Wait, the money multiplier is the inverse of the reserve requirement. So if the reserve requirement is 20%, the money multiplier is 5, as I thought. So each $1 of reserves can create up to $5 in money.

But the government's deficit is $30 billion. So, if the reserve requirement is 20%, the FED can create $30 billion × 5 = $150 billion in the money supply. But wait, the FED's restriction is that the money supply can increase by no more than $40 billion. That doesn't seem right because $150 billion is way more than $40. So perhaps I'm thinking about this incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the national debt increasing in a way that the money supply doesn't increase beyond $40 billion. So, the money supply is growing only by $40 billion, but the government is trying to keep the money supply within that, so the debt might need to be adjusted to prevent that.

Wait, perhaps it's about managing the debt in a way that the money supply doesn't balloon. Let me think about the relationship between the budget deficit and the money supply.

The government's deficit is a negative liability, and it's being used to replenish reserves. The more it spends, the more reserves it depletes, which can lead to a decrease in the money supply if the Fed doesn't intervene. But in this case, the Fed wants to prevent the money supply from increasing by more than $40 billion.

Wait, no, perhaps the money multiplier is 5, so a $1 billion deficit would lead to a $5 billion increase in the money supply. But the Fed doesn't want the money supply to increase by more than $40 billion. So, the maximum allowed ΔM is $40 billion. Let me see: ΔM = MB × multiplier. So MB = ΔM / multiplier. So MB = $40 billion / 5 = $8 billion.

But the money multiplier is 5. So for each $1 billion deficit, the money supply can increase by $5 billion. But the Fed wants to keep ΔM at $40 billion. So MB needs to be $8 billion. But wait, the question is about the national debt increasing by how much, not the monetary base.

Alternatively, maybe the national debt is using the reserves to create money. Let's think again: The money multiplier is 5, so each dollar of reserves can create $5 in the money supply. The government's deficit is $30 billion, which is the amount of reserves it must hold. But the money multiplier is 5, so the money supply would increase by 30 ×5= $150 billion. But the Fed's target is to not have the money supply increase by more than $40 billion. So the initial deficit could be offset by the money created. But I might be getting confused here.

Wait another approach: The money multiplier is 5. So for each dollar of reserves, the money supply can increase by 5 dollars. But the government's budget deficit is $30 billion, which is the amount of reserves it must hold. So without the Fed's intervention, the money supply would be higher. But the Fed wants the money supply not to go beyond a certain level.

Wait, perhaps the money supply is being used to create the debt. So the government's deficit is a negative liability, and the money created from reserves can be used to pay off that deficit. But the Fed's concern is that the money supply can't increase too much, so the debt can't be increased too much.

Wait, the formula I remember is that the money multiplier is 1/rr. So 1/0.2 =5. So if the bank has $1 billion of reserves, it can create $5 billion in the money supply.

The government's deficit is $30 billion, which is a liability. So this $30 billion is the reserves the banks must hold. But the banks can create $5 × $30 billion = $150 billion in the money supply. But the Fed wants this not to happen. So the money supply would go up by $150 billion, but they allow it to go up by a maximum of $40 billion. So the banks can only create $40 billion, which would mean that the reserves would be $40 /5 = $8 billion. But the government's deficit is $30 billion, so the money created is $8, which is less than $30. So the deficit would need to be offset by the money created. Hmm, but this doesn't add up because the money created can't cover the deficit.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 5, so each dollar of reserves can create $5 in the money supply. The government's budget deficit is $30 billion, which is the amount of reserves it holds. So the money supply would increase by 30 ×5 = $150 billion. But the Fed wants the money supply to increase by no more than $40 billion. So the actual money supply can only go up by $40 billion. That means that the money created is $40 billion. So the reserves (which are related to the money) must be $40 /5 = $8 billion. But the government's deficit is $30 billion, so this can't be right because $8 isn't enough to cover $30.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the money multiplier refers to how the money supply is created from reserves. So for each $1 billion in reserves, the money supply increases by $5 billion. The government's deficit is $30 billion, so if they have to hold $30 billion in reserves, the money supply would increase by $150 billion, but the Fed wants it not to go beyond $40 billion. So the maximum allowed ΔM is $40 billion. Therefore, the money created can be $40 billion, which would mean the reserves are $40 /5 = $8 billion. But the government's deficit is $30 billion, so how does that fit?

Wait, perhaps the money multiplier is part of the problem. So for the money to increase by $40 billion, the reserves must be $40 billion /5 = $8 billion. But the government's deficit is $30 billion, so the money created from that is $30 ×5= $150 billion. But the Fed wants the total money supply not to go beyond $40 billion. So the money created is $40 billion, which would mean that only $8 billion is available for the budget deficit. But the government's deficit is $30 billion, which is more than $8. So this doesn't make sense because the money created can't cover the entire deficit.

Wait, perhaps the money multiplier is 5, so each dollar of reserves creates $5. So if the money supply is allowed to increase by $40 billion, then the reserves (which are part of the monetary base) would be $40 /5 = $8 billion. But the government's budget is a deficit of $30 billion, which is a liability. How does that work?

Another approach: The money multiplier tells us that for each dollar of reserves, the money supply increases by 5. So if the money supply is allowed to increase by $40 billion, the reserves would be $8 billion. But the government's budget deficit is $30 billion, which is a liability. So the money created from reserves is $8 billion. But the government needs to create $30 billion in money to cover the deficit. So the total money available is the reserves ($8) plus the money that can be created from it, which is $8×5= $40 billion. So the total money would be $48 billion, but the Fed only allows up to $40. So perhaps the money created is capped at $40, but the government needs to create $30. So the money multiplier would be limited to $40, not 5.

Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. The money multiplier is 5, so each dollar of reserves can create $5 in money. The FED wants the money supply not to increase by more than $40 billion. So the maximum ΔM is $40 billion. Therefore, the maximum reserves that can be created is $40 /5 = $8 billion. But the government's budget deficit is $30 billion. So the money created from this deficit would be $30 ×5 = $150 billion. But the Fed's limit is $40 billion. So the money that can be created is capped at $40 billion, which would mean that the reserves can't be created beyond $8 billion. But the government needs to create $30 billion in reserves to cover the deficit, which is more than the Fed allows. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let's try a different approach. Let's think about the money multiplier. If the FED wants the money supply to increase by no more than $40, then the money created is capped at $40. The money multiplier is 5, so reserves (MB) would be $40 /5 = $8 billion. But the government's budget is a liability of $30 billion. How does that fit in?

Wait, maybe I should think about the required money creation to eliminate the budget deficit. The money multiplier is 5, so the reserves needed to cover a $30 billion deficit would be $30 ×5 = $150 billion. But the Fed can only create up to $40 billion. So the money can't cover the full deficit, which means the government might have to increase its debt to cover the remaining deficit.

Wait, but the question is about how much the national debt must increase. The national debt is the total amount that the country owes. If the money supply can't increase beyond $40, and the money created from the $30 billion deficit is $150, but the Fed limits it to $40, then the total money available is $8 billion (as in reserves) plus the money that can be created, which is $40. So the total is $48 billion, but the money multiplier is 5, so the money supply would be 48 /5 = 9.6 billion. But I'm not sure if this is relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply about the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 5. The government's budget deficit is $30 billion. The FED wants the money supply not to increase beyond $40. So the money created by the budget deficit is $30 ×5 = $150. But the Fed allows only $40, so the money can't be more than $40. Therefore, the money created is capped at $40, so the budget deficit must be covered by the money available. But the money available is $40, which is less than $30 billion? Wait, no, $40 is more than $30. So perhaps the deficit can be covered because the money is enough.

Wait, I'm confused. Let me try to structure this.

1. The budget deficit is $30 billion. This represents the money that the government is spending beyond what it can borrow, which is a negative liability. So this $30 billion is a liability.

2. The FED uses this liability to create money. The money multiplier is 5. So each $1 billion of reserves can create $5 billion in money. So the $30 billion deficit would generate $150 billion in money.

3. However, the Fed wants this not to happen. The maximum money supply increase allowed is $40 billion. So the money created must be capped at $40 billion.

4. Therefore, the maximum reserves that can be used to create $40 billion of money is $40 /5 = $8 billion.

5. So the government's $30 billion deficit requires $150 billion in reserves to create, but the Fed can only use $8 billion. Therefore, the money available is $8 billion created plus any reserves that are not used, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the national debt increasing in such a way that the money supply doesn't exceed $40 billion. So, the money multiplier is 5, so the money supply is M = MB ×5. If the money supply can't increase beyond $40, then MB = 40 /5 = 8 billion. 

But the budget deficit is $30 billion, which is a liability. So, the money supply is M = MB ×5 = 8 ×5 = $40 billion. That matches the Fed's limit. So, the money that can be created is exactly $40 billion. But the government's budget deficit is $30 billion, which is less than $40. So, how much of the budget deficit is covered by the money created?

Wait, maybe the money created is $40 billion, which is more than the $30 billion deficit. So the deficit is covered, and the money supply is at the Fed's limit. So the national debt must not exceed $30 billion because the money created is enough to cover it, and the Fed's limit is reached.

Wait, but the question is about the national debt increasing. So, the national debt would be the initial budget deficit plus the money created. But the money created is capped at $40. So, the national debt would be $30 + $40 = $70 billion? But that's not one of the options. The options go up to $50 billion.

Hmm, this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Another angle: The money multiplier is 5. The government's budget deficit is $30 billion. The money multiplier is 5, so the money supply could increase by 30×5= $150 billion. But the Fed wants this not to exceed $40 billion. So the money created is $40 billion, which would imply that the reserves are $40/5 = $8 billion. But the government's deficit is $30 billion, which is a liability. So the money created from this is $8×5= $40. So the money supply is $8 (from reserves) + $40 (from creation) = $48. But the Fed allows up to $40, so maybe the money can't go beyond that.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should approach it with the formula.

The money multiplier is 1/rr. So money multiplier = 1/0.2 =5.

The money created (ΔM) is the budget deficit multiplied by the money multiplier: ΔM = 30 ×5= $150 billion.

But the Fed's maximum allowed ΔM is $40 billion.

So the money created is $40 billion, which is less than the required $150. So, the money created is only $40. 

Now, how much of the budget deficit is covered by this $40? The money created is $40, so the budget deficit is $30, which is less than $40. That suggests that the money created is enough to cover the deficit, and the money supply has reached the Fed's limit.

Wait, but if the money supply is $40, then the money created is $40. So the budget deficit of $30 is covered by the $40. So the national debt must not exceed $30, which is option B. But the options include higher amounts.

Wait, but the question is about the national debt increasing. If the money supply is allowed to reach $40, then the national debt (which is the current budget deficit plus the money created) would be $30 + $40= $70. But that's not an option either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to find the required national debt such that the money supply doesn't increase beyond $40. So, the money multiplier is 5, so the money supply is M= MB ×5. The money supply can't exceed $40. So MB=40/5=8. 

The MB is the monetary base, which is the sum of reserves plus other reserves. But in this case, the government has a budget deficit, which is a negative liability. So the money created from the reserves is 30×5=150. But the money can't go beyond $40. So perhaps the money created is limited to $40, which would mean that the money created from the budget deficit is only $40. So the budget deficit is $40 /5= $8. But the budget deficit is $30, which is more than $8. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the budget deficit is a negative liability, so it reduces the money supply. The money multiplier is 5, so each dollar of reserves reduces the money supply by $5. So, the government's budget deficit is $30, which would require reserves to be $30. The reserves are part of the monetary base. So the monetary base (MB) is $30. But the money multiplier is 5, so the money supply is $30 ×5= $150. But the Fed's limit is $40. So the money created is $40, which is less than the required $150. So the money supply is capped at $40. So the national debt must not increase beyond $30, because the money created from it is enough to cover it. So the national debt is $30, which is option B.

Wait, but then the money created is $40, which is more than the $30 deficit. So the money supply is $40, which is the Fed's limit. So the national debt can't increase beyond $30 because the money created can cover it. So the answer is option B, $30 billion.

But wait, the question is about how much the national debt must increase. So the initial budget deficit is $30. The money created is $40. So the money supply is $40, which is the Fed's limit. So the national debt must not increase beyond $30 because the money created can cover it. Therefore, the national debt must not exceed $30. So the answer is B, $30 billion.
</think>

The problem involves understanding the relationship between the government's budget deficit and the money supply. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Money Multiplier**: The legal reserve requirement is 20%, so the money multiplier is 1/0.2 = 5.

2. **Government's Budget Deficit**: The government has a budget deficit of $30 billion.

3. **Money Creation Constraint**: The Fed wants the money supply to increase by no more than $40 billion.

4. **Calculating the National Debt**:
   - The money multiplier tells us that for each dollar of reserves, $5 is added to the money supply.
   - The government's $30 billion budget deficit requires $30 billion in reserves.
   - With a money multiplier of 5, the money supply would be $30 × 5 = $150 billion if the reserves were all kept.
   - However, the Fed's constraint limits the money supply to $40 billion.
   - To cover the $30 billion deficit within the $40 billion money supply, the national debt must not increase beyond $30 billion, as the money created ($40 billion) can cover the deficit ($30 billion), and the money supply is capped at the Fed's limit.

Therefore, the national debt must not increase beyond $30 billion to ensure the money supply does not exceed the Fed's constraint of $40 billion.

ANSWER: B
