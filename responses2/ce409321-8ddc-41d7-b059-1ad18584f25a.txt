Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it says to calculate the approximate molar weight of 35.0 grams of a non-electrolyte in solution with 100ml of water. Oh wait, the boiling point of the solution is 102.16 degrees Celsius. The options are A to J, each giving a different ratio of grams to moles.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. I remember that when you have a solution, the boiling point elevation is related to the molality of the solute. The formula is ΔTb = K_b * m, where K_b is the boiling point elevation constant, and m is the molality.

But wait, I'm not told what K_b is for water. Oh, wait, maybe it's a common value. I think for water, K_b is 0.512°C·kg/mol. Yeah, I think that's right. So if I can find the molality, I can relate it to the grams and molar mass.

So the solution's boiling point goes from 100°C (standard) to 102.16, so ΔT is 2.16°C. Using the formula, m = ΔT / K_b. Let me compute that: 2.16 / 0.512. Hmm, let's calculate that. 2.16 divided by 0.512. Let me do the division. 2.16 ÷ 0.512. Well, 0.512 times 4 is 2.048, which is just a bit less than 2.16. So 4.25? Because 0.512 * 4 is 2.048, and 0.512 * 0.25 is 0.128, so 2.048 + 0.128 is 2.176. Oh wait, that's over 2.16. So maybe 4.24? Let me do it more accurately.

Let me compute 2.16 / 0.512. Let's think of 0.512 as 512/1000. So 2.16 * (1000/512) = (2160 / 512). Let's divide 2160 by 512. 512 * 4 is 2048. 2160 - 2048 is 112. So 4 + (112/512). 112 ÷ 512 is 0.21875. So total is 4.21875 mol/kg. So the molality is approximately 4.21875 m.

Wait, molality is moles per kilogram of solvent. The solvent here is water, which is 100ml. Oh wait, 100ml of water is 0.1 kg. So m = 4.21875 mol/kg, which means the solution contains 4.21875 moles per kilogram of water. Since the solvent is 0.1 kg, the moles of solute would be 0.1 kg * 4.21875 mol/kg = 0.421875 moles.

Wait, but wait. The solution has 35 grams of solute. So the molar mass (M) can be found using the formula: mass (g) = moles * molar mass. So rearranged, molar mass M = mass / moles.

So M = 35 g / 0.421875 mol. Let's calculate that. 35 divided by 0.421875. Let me compute 35 / 0.421875. Hmm, 0.421875 is approximately 0.422. 35 / 0.422 ≈ 83.3 g/mol. Wait, 0.422 * 83 is 35. So 83 g/mol is an approximate value.

But looking at the options, the options are:

A: 100 g solute / mole solute → that would imply molar mass is 100 g/mol. Our calculation is around 83, so this would be option D: if my calculation is 83, but let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, molality m is ΔT / K_b. So 2.16°C / 0.512 = 4.21875 m. Wait, yes. So m = 4.21875 mol/kg. With 0.1 kg solvent, moles = 0.1 * 4.21875 = 0.421875 mol.

Mass is 35 g, so molar mass = 35 / 0.421875 ≈ 83.3 g/mol. So the ratio is 35 g / 0.421875 mol ≈ 83.3 g/mol. Looking at the options, option D is 120 g/(mol), which is higher than my value. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 35 / 0.421875. Let me compute 0.421875 times 83.3: 0.421875 * 80 = 33.75, 0.421875 * 3 = 1.265625, 0.421875 * 0.3 = 0.1265625. Adding up: 33.75 +1.265625 is 34.015625 + 0.1265625 = 34.1421875. Wait, that's less than 35. So maybe 84?

Wait, 0.421875 * 84 = 35.421875. Which is more than 35. Hmm. So 84 gives 35.42g, which is higher than the actual mass of 35g. So the molar mass would be a bit less than 84, maybe 83.3. So the ratio is 35 g / 0.421875 mol ≈ 83.3 g/mol. So looking at the options, the closest one is D: 120, which is way too high. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molality calculation.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I miscalculated the boiling point. Let me think again. The solution's boiling point is 102.16°C, the solvent is water at 100°C. So ΔT is 2.16°C. K_b for water is 0.512°C·kg/mol. So m = 2.16 / 0.512 = 4.21875 m. That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the mass of the solvent as 0.1 kg. Oh wait, the solution is 35 grams solute and 100ml of water. Wait, mass of water is 100ml, which is 100 grams? No, wait, no, 100ml of water is 100 grams if it's water, but wait, no. Wait, 100 ml of water is 0.1 kg, because 1 liter is 1 kg, so 100ml is 0.1 kg.

Wait, but the question is about a non-electrolyte, so it doesn't dissociate, so molality is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the exact value again.

Molar mass M = 35g / 0.421875 moles. Let's compute 35 / 0.421875.

Wait 0.421875 is 4218.75/10000. Wait another approach: 0.421875 = 4218.75/10000.

Wait, 35 ÷ 0.421875 = 35 * (10000/4218.75) = (35 * 10000) / 4218.75.

Let me compute that:

35 * 10000 = 350000. 

350000 ÷ 4218.75: Let's see. 4218.75 * 83 = ?

4218.75 * 80 = 337,500

4218.75 * 3 = 12,656.25

Adding up: 337,500 +12,656.25= 349,156.25.

Which is less than 350,000. The difference is 350,000 - 349,156.25= 843.75.

So 83 + (843.75 /4218.75) = 83 + 0.2003...= 83.2003.

So M≈83.2 g/mol.

Looking back at the options, option D is 120, which is way higher. Option H is 110, closer but not there. Option J is 90. Hmm, but 83 isn't any of them. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Let me think again. The formula is m = (ΔT) / K_b. So m is molality = 2.16 / 0.512 = 4.21875 mol/kg.

Wait, but the mass of the solute is 35g. So moles = m * kg of solvent. Solvent is 100ml (water) which is 100 grams? Wait, no, 100ml is 100 grams only if the density is 1g/ml, which it is for water. So yes, 100ml is 100g. So kg is 0.1 kg.

So moles = 0.1 kg * 4.21875 mol/kg = 0.421875 mol.

So M = 35g / 0.421875 mol ≈ 83.3 g/mol.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match, but the closest is option H: 110, I:84, D:120. Hmm, 84 is closer. Wait, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, perhaps the solution is 35.0 grams of solute in 100ml of water. So the solvent is 100ml of water, which is 100 g (assuming 1g/ml). So the molality is 4.21875 m, so 0.421875 moles. So M=35/0.421875=83.3.

So the options don't have 83.3, but option H is 110, which is too high. Option I is 84 g/mol. Hmm, 83.3 is closer to 84 than 110.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 83.3 and see which option is closest. The options are:

A: 100g per mol → 100g/mol → that's higher than our calculation.

B:95 → lower.

C:130 → higher.

D:120 → higher.

E:75 → lower.

F:65 → lower.

G:70 → lower.

H:110 → higher.

I:84 → 84 is close.

J:90 → still lower.

Hmm, so 84 is the closest. So the correct ratio would be 35 g / 0.421875 moles = approximately 83.3 g/mol, which is closest to option I (84) or option H (110). Wait, but 83.3 is exactly between 84 and 80, but 80 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molality calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the boiling point. Let me check the problem again. Oh wait, the solution’s boiling point is 102.16, so the increase is 2.16, which is correct. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, another thought: Is the solution considered a dilute solution? Because if it's a non-electrolyte, the molality is the same as the mole fraction multiplied by the total moles. But I think that's complicating it. Let me think, perhaps the question is referring to molality, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the solution's boiling point, but the molar mass. Wait, the question says "the molar weight of the solute in solution." Wait, no, that's not right. Molar mass is a property of the solute, regardless of the solution. So the question must be about calculating the molar mass based on the solution's properties.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the molar mass.

Molar mass M = mass (g) / moles.

Mass is 35.0 grams.

Moles = (ΔT / K_b) * kg of solvent.

ΔT is 2.16, K_b is 0.512.

So m = 2.16 / 0.512 = 4.21875 m.

Solvent is 100ml of water, which is 100 grams (since density is 1g/ml).

So solvent mass is 0.1 kg.

Moles = 4.21875 * 0.1 = 0.421875 moles.

So M = 35 / 0.421875 ≈ 83.3 g/mol.

Looking at the options, the only one close to 83 is option I:84. So the answer should be option I.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option I is 84 g solute per mole. So the correct ratio is 35 / 0.421875 ≈ 83.3, which is approximately 84. So option I is 84 g/mol. So the answer should be I.

To calculate the approximate molar weight of the non-electrolyte in solution, we use the boiling point elevation formula:

\[
\Delta T_b = K_b \cdot m
\]

where \( \Delta T_b \) is the boiling point elevation, \( K_b \) is the boiling point elevation constant for water (0.512°C·kg/mol), and \( m \) is the molality of the solution. The problem states that the boiling point of the solution is 102.16°C, while the boiling point of pure water is 100°C. Thus, the increase in boiling point is:

\[
\Delta T_b = 102.16 - 100 = 2.16 \, \text{°C}
\]

Using the formula, the molality \( m \) is:

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T_b}{K_b} = \frac{2.16}{0.512} \approx 4.21875 \, \text{mol/kg}
\]

The solute is dissolved in 100 ml of water, which corresponds to 0.1 kg of solvent. The number of moles of solute is:

\[
\text{moles} = m \cdot \text{kg of solvent} = 4.21875 \cdot 0.1 = 0.421875 \, \text{moles}
\]

The mass of the solute is given as 35.0 g, so the molar mass \( M \) of the solute is:

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{moles}} = \frac{35.0}{0.421875} \approx 83.3 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The closest option to the calculated molar mass is **84 g/mol**, which corresponds to **Option I**.
