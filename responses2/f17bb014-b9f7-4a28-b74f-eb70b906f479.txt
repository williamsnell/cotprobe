Question:

Which of the following is true about dietary calcium:


Options:

A: Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day
B: Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium
C: There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures.
D: Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about dietary calcium. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what each option says.

The question is asking which statement is true about dietary calcium. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day. I remember that the recommended daily intake for adults is about 0.8-1.2 mg, but maybe it's lower for some groups. Wait, but the average for most adults is around 200-300mg, but that's for adults over 18, I think. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the average for most adults is around 200-300mg per day, but the question says 0.5-2.0, which seems way too low. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the units. Oh, right, 1 mg is a thousandth of a gram. So 0.5mg is a small amount. Wait, but the typical is higher. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no. 0.5mg is very low, like for infants. For adults, I think the typical is about 0.8-1.2 mg. So option A says 0.5-2.0, which doesn't seem right for adults. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium. Wait, I remember that Vitamin D is involved in calcium metabolism. I think people with higher levels of D (like in men) have higher calcium absorption. But I'm not sure about this. I think the statement here is incorrect because I don't recall it being a true statement. Or maybe it's a common misconception. Alternatively, if B is saying that activated Vitamin D (like from supplements) decreases absorption, that would be true. But the option says "Vitamin D decreases absorption," without specifying if it's activated. I'm not certain, but I don't think B is correct.

Option C: There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures. This rings a bell. I remember reading that high calcium intake can lower bones because it may help in bone formation and strength. So if someone has too much, they might have lower risk. So C seems correct.

Option D: Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low. Wait, no. Absorption efficiency is more about how well the body processes it. So if someone takes less calcium, maybe absorption is lower, not higher. So this option is saying that when you take less (lower intake), absorption is higher, which doesn't make sense. So D is incorrect.

So putting it together:

A: Incorrect. Adults are typically more than that.
B: Not sure, but I think it's a false statement.
C: Correct.
D: Incorrect.

So the correct answer is C.
</think>

The correct answer is C. Here's why:

- **A** is incorrect because the typical daily intake for adults is much higher than 0.5–2.0 mg, around 0.8–1.2 mg.
- **B** is not necessarily true, as the statement might be a common misconception.
- **C** is correct because high calcium intake is linked to reduced bone fractures.
- **D** is incorrect because absorption efficiency is not inversely related to intake; rather, higher intake generally improves absorption.

Answer: C
