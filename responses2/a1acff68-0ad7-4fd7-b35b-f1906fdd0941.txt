Question:

In over 90% of cases, the concentration of ethanol (C_2H_5OH, density = 0.80 g/ml) in blood necessary to produce intoxication is 0.0030 g/ml. A concentration of 0.0070 g/ml is fatal. What volume of 80 proof (40% ethanol by volume) Scotch whiskey must an intoxicated person consume before the concentration of ethanol in his blood reaches a fatal level? Assume that all the alcohol goes directly to the blood and that the blood volume of a person is 7.0 liters.

Options:

A: 30 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
B: 100 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
C: 110 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
D: 120 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
E: 150 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
F: 65 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
G: 50 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
H: 75 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
I: 45 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey
J: 88 ml of 80 proof Scotch whiskey

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this ethanol concentration problem. Let's start by breaking it down step by step.

So, the question says that in over 90% of cases, the concentration of ethanol in blood necessary to produce intoxication is 0.0030 g/ml. And a concentration of 0.0070 g/ml is fatal. The person is already intoxicated, which means their blood has a concentration of 0.0030 g/ml. Now, they need to drink some amount of 80 proof Scotch whiskey to reach the fatal level. The question is, how much should they drink?

First, I need to find out how much ethanol is needed. The blood volume is given as 7 liters, but wait, the concentration given is in g/ml. Oh, wait, the concentration is 0.0030 g/ml, but the blood volume is 7.0 liters. So I need to find the total grams of ethanol in the blood before drinking.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The blood is 7 liters. Each liter is 1000 milliliters. So total blood volume is 7000 ml. The concentration is 0.0030 g/ml. So the total ethanol in blood is 7000 * 0.0030 g. Let me compute that: 7000 * 0.003 is 21 grams. So the blood has 21 grams of ethanol.

Now, the person needs to reach 0.0070 g/ml in their blood. So the total ethanol needed is 7000 ml * 0.0070 g/ml = 49 grams. Because 7000 * 0.007 is 49.

So the person needs an additional 49 -21 = 28 grams of ethanol.

Now, I need to determine how much volume of 80 proof Scotch they need to drink to get 28 grams of ethanol. 

But wait, the question says "before the concentration reaches a fatal level." So the total ethanol in their blood after drinking should be 49 grams. So the ethanol from the whiskey must add 28 grams.

The concentration of ethanol in the whiskey is 80 proof, which is 40% ethanol by volume. So ethanol is 40% of the total volume. But I think I need to calculate the volume of ethanol in the whiskey, not the volume of the whiskey itself. Or wait, maybe the question is about the alcohol content in terms of mass.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused here. The question states that the concentration is by volume, 80 proof is 40% ethanol. So, in 100 ml of the Scotch, 40 ml is ethanol (by volume). But wait, ethanol's density is about 0.789 g/ml. So the mass of ethanol in the volume would be 40 ml * 0.789 g/ml = about 31.56 grams.

But wait, I think I'm mixing up mass and volume. Let me think again. The problem says the ethanol is 80 proof by volume, so 40% ethanol by volume. So, if I have V ml of 80-proof Scotch, the volume of ethanol is 0.4 V, and the ethanol's mass is 0.4 V * density of ethanol.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration in blood. The blood's concentration is given in g/ml. So, they need 28 grams of ethanol in their blood.

So each ml of 80-proof (40% ethanol by volume) will contribute (0.4 * V) * density_of_ethanol. Let me compute the mass.

Density of ethanol is about 0.789 g/mL. So for each 100 ml of the Scotch (which is 40 ml ethanol), the mass is 40 * 0.789 = 31.56 grams.

Wait, but wait. The problem is to find out the volume of 80-proof Scotch needed to get 28 grams of ethanol. Because the person is already at 21 g in their blood, so they need 28 g more.

Wait, but wait, the given ethanol concentration is in the blood before drinking. So the person's blood is 21 g of ethanol. They need to reach 49 g. So they need to add 28 g.

So, how much volume of 80-proof (40% ethanol by volume) will give 28 grams of ethanol.

Let me think: Each ml of 80-proof (40% ethanol by volume) contains 0.4 ml of ethanol (assuming 100ml Scotch is 40ml ethanol by volume). The density of ethanol is about 0.789 g/ml, so the mass contributed by 0.4 ml of ethanol is 0.4 * 0.789 = 0.3156 grams.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question is about the concentration in the blood. The 28 grams is the total ethanol in the blood after drinking. The person's current blood has 21 g, and they need 28 more. So the 28 grams must come from the ethanol in the 80-proof Scotch they drink.

So, each ml of 80-proof (40% ethanol by volume) will contribute 0.4 ml * density_of_ethanol. Let me compute the mass per ml of the alcohol.

Wait, no, the concentration is given as ethanol by volume. So, the 80-proof is 40% ethanol by volume. So, if someone drinks X ml of 80-proof, the volume of ethanol is 0.4 X.

The ethanol's mass is 0.4 X * density_of_ethanol. The density of ethanol is approximately 0.789 g/mL. So, the mass is 0.4 X * 0.789 g/mL = 0.3156 X grams.

Wait, but wait, that would be the mass of ethanol in X ml of 80-proof. So, to reach 28 g, we have:

0.3156 X = 28 g

Wait, that can't be right because 0.3156 is about 0.316, so X = 28 / 0.3156 ≈ 88 ml.

Wait, that's option J: 88 ml. But let me double-check.

Alternative approach: The concentration of alcohol in the blood after drinking should be 0.0070 g/ml. So, the total ethanol in the blood would be 7000 ml * 0.0070 g/ml = 49 grams.

The person already has 21 grams, so the amount needed is 28 grams.

Now, each ml of 80-proof (40% ethanol by volume) contains 0.4 ml ethanol (by volume). But wait, the ethanol's mass would be 0.4 ml (ethanol volume) * density of ethanol (0.789 g/ml) = 0.3156 grams.

So, each ml of the 80-proof gives 0.3156 grams of ethanol. So, to get 28 grams, we need 28 / 0.3156 ≈ 88 ml.

Wait, but wait a second. Another point to consider: the concentration of ethanol in the blood is 0.0070 g/ml. So, that's a mass concentration. So, the alcohol content is 0.0070 g per mL of blood.

But the problem states that the concentration is given in terms of ethanol in blood. So, the 0.0030 g/ml is the mass concentration. So, the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

So, the correct volume is 88 ml, which is option J.

Wait, but let me make sure about the steps again to avoid mistakes.

1. Current blood ethanol: 7000 ml * 0.0030 g/ml = 21 g.

2. Required final ethanol: 7000 ml * 0.0070 g/ml = 49 g.

3. Additional needed: 49 -21 =28 g.

4. Each ml of 80-proof (40% ethanol by volume) provides 0.4 ml ethanol by volume. But the mass is 0.4 ml * 0.789 g/ml = 0.3156 g.

5. So, volume V: 28 g / 0.3156 g/ml ≈ 88 ml. So option J.
</think>

To determine how much 80-proof Scotch whiskey an intoxicated person must consume to reach a fatal ethanol concentration in their blood, we proceed as follows:

1. **Current ethanol in blood**:  
   The blood volume is 7.0 liters (7000 ml), and the ethanol concentration is 0.0030 g/ml.  
   Total ethanol = \( 7000 \, \text{ml} \times 0.0030 \, \text{g/ml} = 21 \, \text{g} \).

2. **Ethanol required for fatal concentration**:  
   The fatal ethanol concentration is 0.0070 g/ml.  
   Total ethanol needed = \( 7000 \, \text{ml} \times 0.0070 \, \text{g/ml} = 49 \, \text{g} \).

3. **Additional ethanol needed**:  
   Additional ethanol required = \( 49 \, \text{g} - 21 \, \text{g} = 28 \, \text{g} \).

4. **Ethanol contribution from 80-proof Scotch**:  
   - 80-proof Scotch has a concentration of 40% ethanol by volume.  
   - For each 100 ml of 80-proof Scotch, 40 ml is ethanol (by volume).  
   - The mass of ethanol in 100 ml of 80-proof Scotch is:  
     \[
     40 \, \text{ml} \times 0.789 \, \text{g/ml} = 31.56 \, \text{g}.
     \]
   - Thus, each 100 ml of 80-proof Scotch contributes 31.56 g of ethanol.

5. **Volume of 80-proof Scotch needed**:  
   To obtain 28 g of ethanol:  
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{28 \, \text{g}}{31.56 \, \text{g/100 ml}} = \frac{28}{0.3156} \approx 88 \, \text{ml}.
   \]

Thus, the person must consume approximately **88 ml** of 80-proof Scotch whiskey to reach the fatal ethanol concentration in their blood.
