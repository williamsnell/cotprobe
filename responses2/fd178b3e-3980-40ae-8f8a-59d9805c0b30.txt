Question:

A defendant and his college roommate went home together for the holiday vacation. The defendant was to go back to college by himself. The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates. The defendant agreed, and the roommate gave him a small package, which the defendant placed in his glove compartment. While driving back to school, the defendant was stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, he reached into the glove compartment. As he did, the package that his roommate had given him fell onto the floor. When it hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. If the defendant is later brought to trial for this charge, his best defense is that

Options:

A: the package didn't belong to him.
B: the cocaine was illegally seized.
C: the trooper didn't have a search warrant.
D: the defendant didn't know what was in the package.

Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question to tackle. Let me read through it carefully and figure out the right answer.

So, the scenario is about a defendant who went home with his roommate to celebrate a holiday. The defendant was supposed to drive back to college alone but instead agreed to deliver a package to a classmate. His roommate gave the package, which turned out to be cocaine. The state trooper stopped him for speeding. When the trooper checked into the glove compartment, the package fell onto the floor, and a plastic envelope with an envelope of something was found. That something was identified as cocaine.

The question is about the defendant's best defense if he's brought to trial for possession of illegal narcotics. The options are A to J.

Hmm, so let's break down the evidence. The defendant was driving back, stopped for speeding. He had a package from his roommate. The package contained cocaine. But when the trooper checked his glove compartment, it looked like the package was there. But the package fell onto the floor, and the envelope opened to find the substance.

Wait, so the package was in his glove compartment, but the roomie's package fell on the floor. Does that mean the roomie's package is the actual evidence of the crime? Or is the roomie's package considered evidence of the defendant's possession?

In evidence law, evidence of someone else's property is generally not admissible unless there's clear exceptions. But in this case, the roomie's package is being delivered, so it's the defendant's own property. When the defendant is stopped, he's supposed to search for their own vehicle or the package. But how does the roomie's package relate to the defendant's own?

Wait, the defendant is carrying the package, so when he's stopped, he should check the glove compartment. But the package fell on the floor. Is that considered evidence of the defendant's possession? Or is it more about the roomie's package being the real evidence?

Wait, the roomie's package is the actual evidence. Because the package was given to the defendant, which was part of the roomie's. So the court would want to see the roomie's package as the original evidence. Because the defendant's own gloves can't be used as evidence of someone else's property.

Wait, but the package fell onto the floor. So the roomie's package is on the floor when the trooper checked. So the evidence is that the package fell onto the floor, and the envelope was found. So the roomie's package is the evidence of the defendant's possession because it's the one that's being delivered.

So, the defendant's gloves can be searched, but the roomie's package is the real evidence. So the evidence of the defendant's own property (the package) is the roomie's package.

Looking at the options, option B says the package was illegally seized. But that's a factual issue. The question is about the defense against the charge of possession.

Wait, but in this case, the roomie's package is the evidence. So the defendant's gloves can't be used because the roomie's package is the evidence. So the best defense would be that the package didn't belong to him because the roomie's is the real evidence.

Wait, but the package is a delivery, so the roomie's package is the evidence. The defendant's gloves can't be used as evidence of the roomie's package. So the best defense is that the roomie's package was the evidence, so the defendant's gloves were not the source of the package.

Wait, but the roomie's package was part of the defendant's possession. So when the defendant was stopped, he was supposed to search for the package. But when the package fell, the roomie's own package was being searched. Wait, no, the roomie's package is not in the defendant's gloves. The gloves are from the defendant, who was carrying the package.

Wait, the defendant's gloves would be the one he's carrying, which includes the package. So when he's stopped, he's supposed to check the gloves. But the package fell on the floor. So the roomie's package is on the floor. So the defendant's gloves could be searched for the package, but perhaps he didn't know or wasn't supposed to search the roomie's package.

Wait, but the roomie's package was given to the defendant. So when the defendant was stopped, he had to search for his own package, but the roomie's package was a separate entity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The roomie gave the package to the defendant, so the roomie's package is part of the defendant's property. So when the defendant is stopped, he's supposed to check the glove compartment for the package. But the package fell onto the floor, which is a separate location. So the roomie's package isn't in the defendant's own gloves, but is the evidence of the defendant's own package.

So the court would want to see the roomie's package as the evidence of the defendant's possession because the defendant was carrying the package, which was given by the roomie. Therefore, the evidence that the defendant has the package is the roomie's package, not the defendant's gloves.

So the best defense would be that the package didn't belong to the defendant because the roomie's package was the evidence. So looking at the options, option B is "the package didn't belong to him." That seems correct.

Wait, but option B is about the package being illegal. But the question is about the best defense, not about the actual charge. So the best defense is that the roomie's package is the evidence, so the defendant's gloves were not the cause. So the best defense is that the package didn't belong to him.

Wait, but the options are labeled as the best defense. So which option is that?

Looking at the options, the choice that says "the package didn't belong to him" is B.

Wait, but the options are:

A: package didn't belong.

B: package illegal.

C: trooper no search.

D: defendant didn't know.

E: roomie charged.

F: roomie charged.

Wait, the options are:

A: package didn't belong.

B: the package was illegal.

C: the trooper didn't have a search warrant.

D: defendant didn't know.

E: roomie charged.

F: roomie charged.

Wait, the options are such that F is "the roommate should be the one charged." That's not correct because the roomie gave the package to the defendant. So F is incorrect.

So the best defense is that the package didn't belong to him because it's the roomie's. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The defendant was stopped for speeding, and his roommate gave him a package. He agreed to deliver. The package fell onto the floor when he checked the glove compartment. So the package wasn't his own, but the roomie's. So the evidence is the roomie's package, so the defendant's gloves can't be used as evidence of the roomie's package. So the best defense is that the package didn't belong to him, so option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-read the charge. The state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. So the defendant is charged with possession of a controlled substance.

The best defense would be that the roomie's package was the real evidence, so the defendant's own package wasn't the cause. So the best defense is that the package didn't belong to him, which is option A. So the best answer is option B or A?

Wait, the options are presented as individual options, so the answer needs to be one of A-J.

So, reviewing the options:

A: the package didn't belong to him.

B: the package was illegally seized.

C: the trooper didn't have a search warrant.

D: the defendant didn't know what was in the package.

E: the roommate should be the one charged.

F: the roommate should be the one charged.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The options are A to J, each the name of an option. The question is about the best defense. So the best defense is that the package didn't belong to him. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but wait, the package did belong to him in the sense that it's the roomie's. So the evidence is the roomie's package, so the defendant's own gloves can't be used. So the best defense is that the package didn't belong to him. So the answer is option A.

Alternatively, the charge is that the defendant has a package, but the package is the roomie's. So if the defendant is later brought to trial, he can argue that the roomie's package was the evidence, and the defendant didn't have the package. So the best defense would be that the package didn't belong to him. So option A is correct.

Wait, but the options are:

A: the package didn't belong to him.

So the answer would be A.

But I'm a bit uncertain because in some cases, evidence from the roomie's package is admissible. Wait, no. Evidence of someone else's property is not admissible unless it's clear from the context. But in this case, the defendant is carrying the package, which is the roomie's. So when the defendant is stopped, he's supposed to check the roomie's package if it's in the glove compartment. But in this case, the package fell onto the floor when he searched. So the evidence is the roomie's package.

The defendant's gloves can't be used as evidence of the roomie's package because the roomie's package is a separate entity. So the best defense is that the package didn't belong to him because it's not his own. Thus, option A ("the package didn't belong to him") is correct.

Wait, but what about the roomie's package being on the floor when he checked the glove compartment? Does that mean the roomie's package is the actual evidence? Yes, because the defendant was stopped for speeding, and he was supposed to check for his own package, but the package fell away. But since the roomie's package was given to him, it's the evidence of his possession.

So the best defense is that the package didn't belong to him. So the answer is A.
</think>

The defendant was stopped for speeding and gave a package containing cocaine to a roommate. The roomie's package fell onto the floor, and the defendant checked his gloves, where there was no evidence of the package. The best defense is that the package did not belong to the defendant, as it is the roomie's property. This defense is supported because the evidence of the defendant's own property (the package) is the roomie's package, which is separate and not admissible as evidence of the defendant's own property.

ANSWER: A
