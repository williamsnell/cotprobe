Question:

A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?

Options:

A: Nitroprusside
B: Verapamil
C: Alteplase
D: Furosemide
E: Phentolamine
F: Atorvastatin
G: Carvedilol
H: Metoprolol
I: Lisinopril
J: Warfarin

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right answer to this multiple-choice question. Let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 25-year-old man who developed chest pain and shortness of breath one hour ago. He snorted cocaine for the first time and rated his pain a 7 out of 10. The pain is radiating down his left arm. His medical history is unremarkable, so no issues with liver, kidneys, or heart problems. He's on no medications or illicit drugs. His height is 178 cm (5'10") and weight is 70 kg (154 lbs), with a BMI of 22 kg/m². His blood pressure is 200/100 mm Hg, which is a bit high for his age, but with chest pain, that's a bit concerning. He's diaphoretic, which I think means he's more sensitive to cold or shock. 

Looking at vital signs: temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), which is normal. Pulse is 110/min, which is quite high. Respiration is 16/min, which is also quite high. Blood pressure is 200/100, which is a bit elevated but not necessarily dangerous on its own. Pupil size is normal, so not myopia or hyperopia. His eyes are reactive to light and can adjust, which is a bit concerning but not necessarily indicative of any specific condition. His lungs are clear, so no smoke or infection issues. 

The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, meaning the heart rate is too fast. No ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. That's a red flag because sinus tachycardia usually points to either electrolyte imbalances or electrolyte imbalances in a different way. Wait, sinus tachycardia can also be due to electrolyte imbalances, like high sodium or potassium, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances like sodium hyperkalemia or potassium hyperprolactamia. But the question also mentions that the patient is diaphoretic, which might imply a problem with the brain or nervous system, or perhaps a condition like hypokalemia or hyperprolactamia.

Since the patient is on several medications: 325-mg aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam. Aspirin is used for pain relief, nitroglycerin is for heartburn, and lorazepam is for anxiety. But his chest pain is the primary issue, and he's receiving oxygen and these drugs, but the problem persists despite therapy.

The options given are various medications. Let's look at each:

A: Nitroprusside - This is used for the treatment of arrhythmias, especially sinus tachycardia. It's a diuretic, which can cause edema. But the patient has no edema signs, like cyanosis or clubbing. Also, diuretics can cause edema, but this patient's ECG doesn't show that. Plus, he's on a low dose of nitroprusside, so maybe not the right choice here.

B: Verapamil - This is used for the treatment of electrolyte imbalances, like hyperkalemia or hyperprolactamia. It's an electrolyte agent. If the patient's sodium is high, this could help lower it. However, the patient's blood pressure is elevated, so he might have high sodium levels as well, but I'm not sure. Verapamil is a common first-line treatment for electrolyte imbalances.

C: Alteplase - This is a diuretic, used for sinus tachycardia. It's a potassium inhibitor, so it reduces the amount of water excreted, which can cause heart muscle weakness and tachycardia. Alteplase can cause edema, but in this case, there's no cyanosis or clubbing of the digits, and the ECG doesn't show ST-segment changes. Also, the patient's symptoms are more likely related to electrolytes than diuretics.

D: Furosemide - This is a potassium-sparing agent, used to treat electrolyte imbalances. It works by increasing potassium levels, which can lower potassium levels in the blood. Furosemide is a good option if the patient has high potassium levels. However, the patient's blood pressure is elevated, so I'm not sure if potassium is high. Also, he's on aspirin, which contains a high amount of potassium, so that could be a problem.

E: Phentolamine - This is used to reduce heart rate and blood pressure in severe cases, often used with the first-line medications if they cause severe symptoms. It might be used if there's a sudden heart failure or if the patient's heart rate is too high. Phentolamine can also cause edema, but again, the patient's ECG doesn't show that.

F: Atorvastatin - This is a statin, which is an anti-inflammatory drug. It can lower blood pressure, but in this case, the patient's blood pressure is high, so maybe he's taking statins for another issue, like high cholesterol, but that's not indicated here.

G: Carvedilol - This is a diuretic, used for electrolyte imbalances. It's a potassium inhibitor, similar to Alteplase. But again, the patient's ECG doesn't show any issues with diuretics, so this might not be the answer.

H: Metoprolol - This is used to treat electrolyte imbalances. It's a potassium/sodium blocker that can lower potassium levels, which may help with electrolyte imbalances. However, the patient's blood pressure is elevated, so I'm not sure about the effect on that. Metoprolol also causes edema. 

I: Lisinopril - This is a potassium-sparing agent used to treat electrolyte imbalances. It can help lower potassium levels, which might help with the patient's condition. However, the patient's blood pressure is high, so this might not be the first choice.

J: Warfarin - This is a blood-thinning agent. It's used to prevent clots, but it doesn't directly address the chest pain or heart issue. The patient's symptoms are more likely due to electrolyte imbalances rather than blood thinning.

Looking back, the patient's chest pain and shortness of breath are due to an electrolyte imbalance. He's on aspirin, which can cause high potassium, and he's taking nitroglycerin and lorazepam. However, the primary issue is the electrolyte imbalance. The ECG doesn't show sulfuric acid or other acid-base issues.

Verapamil is a common first-line treatment for electrolyte disorders like hyperkalemia or hyperprolactamia. It's a potassium or sodium-sparing agent, so it could lower potassium levels, which might help with his symptoms. However, if the patient's sodium is high, this might not be the first choice. 

Another option is Alteplase, but that's more for sinus tachycardia and causes edema. Since the patient's symptoms are not due to diuretics, maybe that's not the best fit.

Alternatively, if the patient's potassium is high due to aspirin, Alteplase might not be appropriate because it also affects potassium. So, maybe Verapamil is more suitable here.

Wait, but the patient's blood pressure is elevated. If he's on aspirin, which is a diuretic, the diuretics can cause edema. But the patient's symptoms are chest pain and shortness, not edema. So maybe the underlying issue is electrolyte imbalances.

So, the next step is to look for an electrolyte agent. Verapamil and Alteplase are both electrolyte agents. Alteplase is a potassium inhibitor, which can cause tachycardia and edema, but if the patient's symptoms are primarily related to the heart, maybe Alteplase is okay.

Wait, but the patient is on 325 mg aspirin, which is a diuretic. So, perhaps the patient's condition is caused by high potassium. Aspirin can cause high potassium, which can be treated with either Alteplase or Verapamil.

But Verapamil is a potassium-sparing agent, so if he's on aspirin and needs a potassium-sparing agent, Verapamil would be more appropriate. Alteplase is a potassium inhibitor, which can cause edema, but that's not indicated here.

So, the correct answer would be B: Verapamil.

Alternatively, some patients might take both, but in this case, the primary issue is electrolyte imbalance.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the next treatment. The patient is on several medications, but the primary issue is electrolyte imbalance. The next step is to treat that. Verapamil is a potassium-sparing agent, which can lower potassium levels, which may help in his condition.

Alternatively, Alteplase is a potassium inhibitor, which can cause tachycardia and edema. Since the patient's chest pain is the primary issue, perhaps Alteplase is still more appropriate because it's a viable option for sinus tachycardia, even if it causes edema. But the patient's ECG doesn't show any edema, so maybe Alteplase is not the answer here.

Alternatively, maybe another electrolyte agent is more suitable, but given the options, the best fit is Verapamil.

The patient is a 25-year-old man with chest pain and shortness of breath, radiating to his left arm, who has unremarkable medical history and is on several medications including aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam. Vital signs indicate a high temperature (37.5°C), high blood pressure (200/100 mm Hg), and no edema or cyanosis. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which could be due to electrolyte imbalances if sodium is elevated, but the patient's blood pressure is high, suggesting a possible hyperkalemia or hyperprolactamia.

Given the patient's condition, the next step is to address electrolyte imbalances. Verapamil is a potassium-sparing agent, which can help lower potassium levels, potentially improving symptoms. It is a suitable option for treating electrolyte disorders like hyperkalemia or hyperprolactamia. Alteplase, on the other hand, is a potassium inhibitor that causes tachycardia and edema, which may not be indicated here since the patient's ECG does not show edema.

Other options like nitroprusside, bisphosphonate, or carvedilol are diuretics that could cause edema, which is not indicated. Alteplase and Alprazolam are not listed as options. Therefore, the most appropriate next pharmacotherapy is Verapamil.
