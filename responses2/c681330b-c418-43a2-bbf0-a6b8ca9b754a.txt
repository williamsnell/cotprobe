Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about hyperfine lines in an EPR spectrum. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says that a matrix isolated Na atom shows four hyperfine lines in its X-band EPR spectrum. The resonant fields are at 3074, 3174, 3274, and 3374 Gauss. I need to find the g value of the atom.

Hmm, I remember that hyperfine splitting in atoms comes from the interaction between the electron's magnetic dipole and the nuclear magnetic dipole moments. The splitting is a result of the magnetic dipole interaction between the electron and the nucleus. I think the splitting energy depends on the g-factor of the nucleus.

Wait, the g-factor is a dimensionless quantity that accounts for the magnetic dipole interaction. For electrons, the g-factor is usually around 2, but when the nucleus is involved, it can be different. Also, the hyperfine splitting is related to the nuclear magneton and the electron g-factor.

The formula for the hyperfine splitting energy (E) is something like E = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_e * μ_n) * (g/2) * (1/(r^3)), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, I recall that the splitting in EPR is given by Δ = (μ0/4π) * (μ_e * μ_n) * (g/2) * (1/(r^3)), but maybe there's a more simplified approach for this problem.

Wait, another angle: the splitting in the spectrum corresponds to the hyperfine structure, and the number of lines suggests a certain g-factor. The number of hyperfine lines usually depends on the symmetry of the nucleus. For example, if the nucleus has a higher symmetry, say, like a cube, the splitting would be more complex, but for a simple nucleus like the alkali metals, maybe it's a certain number of lines.

Wait, the number of hyperfine lines usually corresponds to the number of possible transitions due to the nuclear spin. For a nucleus with a spin of I, I think the number of lines would be 2I + 1. But wait, that's more for the splitting in the spectrum. Alternatively, the splitting might be a result of the hyperfine structure leading to multiple lines based on the nuclear spin.

Wait, but in this question, we have four hyperfine lines. If the nucleus has a spin I, then the number of lines would be 2I + 1. So, if there are four lines, that would imply 2I + 1 = 4, so I = 1.5. Wait, that can't be right because spin is usually integer or half-integer. So, 2I +1 must equal 4, which would mean I is 1.5. But that's impossible because most nuclei have integer or ½ spin. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to the Zeeman effect, but that's when the atom is in a magnetic field. But in this case, the question is about hyperfine splitting, so perhaps a different approach is needed.

Let me think about the hyperfine splitting formula. The energy levels splitting is given by the formula:

ΔE = (μ0/4π) * (μ_e * μ_n) * (g/2) * (1 / r^3)

But wait, perhaps there's a simpler way. I remember that in EPR, the hyperfine splitting is often quantified by the splitting between the lines, which is proportional to the g-factor. The splitting ΔE can be expressed in terms of the hyperfine coupling constant, which depends on the g-factor.

Wait, another approach. The hyperfine splitting in EPR is usually described by the formula:

ΔE_n = (μ_n * μ_e * g / 2) * (1/r^3) * (μ0/(4π))

But I'm not entirely confident about the exact expression. Alternatively, I've heard that for hyperfine structure, the splitting is given by ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_n * μ_e) * (g/2) * (1/r^3), where μ_n is the nuclear magneton and μ_e is the electron's magneton.

The nuclear magneton μ_n is approximately 5.05 x 10^-27 Am², and the electron's magnetic moment μ_e is about (eħ)/(2m_e c), but I'm not sure if I need the exact value here.

Wait, perhaps the splitting in the EPR spectrum is given by a formula where the number of lines corresponds to the number of possible transitions. For example, if the splitting leads to four lines, then there are three possible transitions between the states. Or perhaps each line corresponds to a different spin state.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine splitting in the EPR spectrum is related to the g-factor via the formula:

g = (ΔE) * 4π r^3 / (μ0 μ_n μ_e)

Wait, I'm a bit tangled up here. Let me think about the EPR line splitting. The hyperfine splitting leads to a particular line spacing in the EPR spectrum. The line spacing is given by the energy difference between adjacent lines, which is proportional to the g-factor.

Another angle: the splitting in the EPR spectrum is often given by:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_e * μ_n) * g / 2 * (1/r^3)

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the hyperfine splitting in EPR for a given atom is given by:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (g * μ_e * μ_n) / (2 r^3)

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is determined by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the exact formula, so maybe I should focus on the information given. The task is to find the g-value of the Na atom. 

The given hyperfine lines are at 3074, 3174, 3274, 3374 Gauss. Wait, but that's the resonant fields, but the actual magnetic field strength in the EPR spectrum is given by B = B0 * (1 - 0.0009 f), where f is the field frequency. But wait, the question says the resonant fields are at 3074, 3174, etc. So perhaps those are the resonant fields of the EPR spectrum? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the actual field strength in the EPR spectrum is given by B = B0 * (1 - 0.0009 f), where f is the field frequency. But wait, the resonant fields given are 3074, 3174, etc. Oh wait, maybe those are the values of (f - 12.25 GHz) (in MHz) at which the resonances occur. So, for example, if f is 12.25 + 3074 MHz, the field B is 3074 * (1 - 0.0009) = approx 3074 * 0.9991 ≈ 3072 Gauss. But wait, perhaps for the purpose of this calculation, the exact field strength isn't needed, and the splitting is more about the g-factor.

But perhaps I should focus on the hyperfine splitting. The number of lines in EPR for a given nucleus depends on the nuclear spin. For example, if the nucleus has spin I=1, then there would be 2I+1=3 lines. But in this case, the question says four lines, so 2I +1=4 → I=1.5, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm mistaken. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to a combination of hyperfine and Zeeman effects, leading to more lines.

Wait, another thought: the hyperfine splitting in EPR for a nucleus with spin I would lead to 2I + 1 lines if the nucleus is in a state where the spin is fixed, but perhaps when the magnetic field is varying, different spin states are possible. Alternatively, perhaps the number of lines isn't directly related to the spin, but more to the number of possible transitions or the g-factor.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is given by the formula:

g = (ΔE * 4π r^3) / (μ0 μ_n μ_e)

But without knowing the exact values of μ0, μ_n, μ_e, and r, this doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can find a relation between the splitting and the g-factor.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is given by a formula where the number of lines corresponds to the number of possible transitions. For example, if the splitting leads to four lines, then there are three possible transitions between the states. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the hyperfine splitting in EPR is often quantified by the g-value. The g-factor is a dimensionless quantity that accounts for the magnetic dipole interaction. For the EPR spectrum, the splitting energy ΔE is proportional to g.

Wait, another approach: the number of hyperfine lines is given as four. If the nucleus is in a spin state that allows for transitions between multiple states, the number of lines can be related to the possible transitions. For example, if the nucleus has spin I=2, then there are 2I + 1 =5 states, but that's not the case here. Wait, but the number of lines is four, which would imply that there are four possible transitions, perhaps between states with different m_I values.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of lines is equal to the number of possible m_I states. So if m_I can be -1, 0, 1, 2 → four states, which would lead to four lines. But that would require I=2. But wait, I'm not sure. 

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to think about the splitting formula for hyperfine structure. The hyperfine splitting energy (ΔE) is given by:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_n * μ_e) * (g/2) * (1/r^3)

But I'm not confident about the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

ΔE = (μ0 * μ_n * μ_e * g) / (4π r^3)

Wait, the hyperfine splitting is a result of the interaction between the electron's magnetic dipole and the nucleus's magnetic dipole. The strength of this interaction is given by the formula:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_n * μ_e) * (g) * (1/r^3)

But I'm not sure about the exact proportionality. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_n * μ_e) * (g/2) * (1/r^3)

Wait, that makes more sense because the magnetic dipole interaction would cause a splitting that's proportional to g. But without knowing the exact value of g, I can't compute the energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. The problem gives the resonant fields of the EPR spectrum, which are 3074, 3174, etc., but perhaps these are the actual magnetic field strengths experienced by the EPR atoms. Hmm, but the actual B field in the EPR spectrum is B = B0 * (1 - 0.0009 f), where f is the field frequency. But in this case, the question doesn't provide the actual field strength, so perhaps I can ignore that part.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each hyperfine line corresponds to a different state of the nucleus, and the number of lines is four, so the g-factor is determined via the splitting between these states.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the hyperfine splitting leads to a specific line spacing, and the number of lines (or the spacing) can be used to calculate the g-factor. But I'm not sure how without the exact relation.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is given by the formula:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_n * μ_e) * (g/2) * (1/r^3)

But without knowing μ0, r, or other values, I can't compute this directly.

Wait, but perhaps the value of r is not needed because the problem is asking for the g-factor, which is a dimensionless quantity. So perhaps the formula that relates the splitting to the g-factor is something like:

g = (ΔE * 4π r^3) / (μ0 μ_n μ_e)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting in the EPR spectrum is given by:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (μ_n * μ_e) * (g) * (1/r^3)

If that's the case, then rearranging for g would give:

g = (ΔE * 4π r^3) / (μ0 μ_e μ_n )

But again, without knowing any of the values, I can't compute this. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a simplified version of the formula. For example, the hyperfine splitting in EPR is given by:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (g * μ_e * μ_n) * (1/r^3)

But I might need to think back to the hyperfine structure. The hyperfine splitting is typically given by ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (g * μ_e * μ_n) * (1/r^3) * (I think that's correct), where I is the nuclear spin.

Wait, but in this problem, the number of hyperfine lines is four. So perhaps I can find the possible g from the splitting.

Wait, another approach: The hyperfine splitting causes the energy levels to split into a set of lines, each corresponding to a different state of the nucleus. The number of lines would depend on the possible m_I values. For example, if the nucleus has a spin I=2, it can have m_I = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 → five states. But in this problem, four lines are observed. Hmm, perhaps the nucleus's spin is I=1.5, which is not possible because spin is usually integer or half-integer. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting leads to four lines because the nucleus has I=2, but that gives five states, which would lead to five lines. So perhaps the given four lines are a result of the hyperfine structure, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The number of hyperfine lines is four, which suggests that the splitting is such that there are four possible transitions between m_I values. For example, if the nucleus has I=2, the m_I can take values -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 → five states, but perhaps the number of transitions between these is four. So, maybe the number of lines is four, which would correspond to I=2, so g-factor is 2. But then which option has g=2? Option A is 2.005, which is close to 2.0.

Wait, but wait. If the splitting is four lines, then the number of possible transitions is four. So, if the m_I can take values from, say, -1 to +2, that's four states. Then, the possible transitions are between m_I = -1 to 0, 0 to +1, +1 to +2. So, three transitions. Hmm, not four.

Wait, perhaps the four lines come from the combination of the splitting and the Zeeman effect? Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the splitting in the EPR spectrum to find the g-factor. But I'm not recalling the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the g-factor can be determined from the number of lines. For example, if there are four lines, perhaps it's because the splitting is such that the g-factor is 2.2 or somewhere else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the hyperfine splitting in EPR leads to a specific line spacing. The line spacing in the EPR spectrum is given by Δν = ν_split / (1 - (g/2)), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible g-values. The options are:

A: 2.005
B: 1.950
C: 2.200
D: 2.250
E: 1.990
F: 2.002
G: 2.100
H: 2.020
I: 2.010

I recall that the g-factors for alkali metals are often around 2 for the 1s state. For example, Na has a g-factor of about 2.005, which is option A. So, perhaps the correct answer is A.

But wait, the number of hyperfine lines is four. Why? If the g-factor is 2, the hyperfine splitting would lead to a certain number of lines. But in this case, with four lines, perhaps the g-factor is higher, like option C (2.2) or G (2.100).

Wait, another thought. The hyperfine splitting in the EPR spectrum is given by:

ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (g * μ_e * μ_n) * (1/r^3)

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is given by ΔE = (μ0/(4π)) * (g * μ_e * μ_n * 1/r^3). Then, solving for g gives:

g = (ΔE * 4π r^3) / (μ0 μ_e μ_n)

But again, without knowing the exact values of these constants, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the hyperfine splitting in terms of the number of hyperfine lines. If the number of lines is four, then the maximum possible g-factor would be around 2. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible g-factor values and see which one would lead to four lines. Let's say that for each possible g, the number of lines is four. For example, if the splitting is such that the maximum g is around 2.2, then perhaps the number of lines is four. But I'm not certain.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the g-factor of Na is approximately 2.0, which is option A. But why four lines then?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the number of lines but the g-factor based on the magnetic field strength. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option G (2.100). Because I remember that the g-factor for alkali metals is around 2.0 to 2.2, depending on the state. So, if the g-factor is 2.1, which is option G, then the number of lines would be four.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the correct answer is option G, which is 2.100. But I'm not entirely confident, so I'll have to go with that.

The problem involves determining the g-factor of a matrix metal (Na) based on the hyperfine splitting observed in its EPR spectrum. The resonant fields provided (3074, 3174, etc.) correspond to the actual magnetic field strengths in the EPR spectrum, but the key to solving the problem lies in the number of hyperfine lines observed (four lines). 

The hyperfine splitting in EPR is typically related to the magnetic dipole interaction between the electron's magnetic moment (μ_e) and the nucleus's magnetic moment (μ_n). The splitting energy (ΔE) is proportional to the g-factor, which accounts for the nuclear spin and magnetic dipole interaction. For alkali metals, the g-factor is often close to 2.0, with variations depending on the nuclear spin and state.

Given the four hyperfine lines observed, the problem becomes determining the g-factor that corresponds to this splitting. The options provided include g-factors ranging from 1.950 to 2.250. Based on the reasoning that the g-factor for Na is typically around 2.0 to 2.2, the most plausible answer is **G: 2.100**, as it represents a reasonable g-factor for the observed splitting.
