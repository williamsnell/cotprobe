The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The Opposition tells us that we ought not to govern a people without their consent. I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?â€¦Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny."
Albert J. Beveridge, "The March of the Flag," 1898
Which of the following rationales does Beveridge employ in his argument?

Options:

A: Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.
B: The United States is obligated to expand its territory for the sake of national security.
C: The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.
D: Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out which option Beveridge uses in his argument. Let me read the question again. The passage is about Albert J. Beveridge's "The March of the Flag," 1898. The question is about which rationale he employs, given the argument he presented.

The argument goes like this: Beveridge says that the opposition points out that governments should respect the consent of the governed. He then argues against self-government, saying he's governed the Indians and our children without their consent. He's asking the readers to consider whether the people of the Philippines would prefer a just government over the villainous legacy of pillage and extortion.

He then goes on to talk about the necessity of expanding the U.S. territory, as men without a desire for self-rule might just want the same. He even mentions that powerful nations have a moral duty to govern the less developed ones. 

So, looking at the options:

Option A: "Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations." Hmm, does Beveridge mention this? His argument seems more about self-governance and the moral duty of powerful nations. So probably not A.

Option B: "The U.S. is obligated to expand its territory for the sake of national security." Again, his argument doesn't mention national security. He's talking about self-governance and moral duty. So B is probably not the correct choice.

Option C: "Closing the western frontier impels the U.S. to expand overseas." This seems more like a historical fact about the U.S. expanding, not directly related to his moral duty argument. So C is not the answer.

Option D: "Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations." That's exactly what Beveridge says. He's arguing that powerful nations should take over less developed areas because they have the moral obligation. 

So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D: " Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations."

**Answer: D**
