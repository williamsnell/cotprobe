Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?

Options:

A: Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.
B: How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other
C: How the threat of steppe nomads shaped China's military strategy in the 1300s
D: Why China and Europe had different military strategies during the Middle Ages
E: How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion
F: Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era
G: How the development of gunpowder weaponry influenced the outcomes of wars in the Middle Ages
H: How the geopolitical environment influenced the development of military technology in different regions
I: Why China chose to invest in horse archer units instead of gunpowder weaponry during the medieval period
J: How the development of gunpowder weaponry was influenced by the economic status of countries

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about gunpowder Weaponry and European vs. Chinese military strategies. Let me try to break it down.

The passage talks about how in Western Europe, from the 1200s to the 1400s, early cannons were useful for sieges. These cannons were heavy and slow to fire, which made them more valuable because they could be used in prolonged sieges. That probably means the rulers gave money and experimental units to develop gunpowder. But contrastingly, in China, especially after the mid-1300s, they were threatened by steppe nomads. Early gunpowder weapons were unwieldy and not useful there. So China focused on improving horse archers, which are more mobile, to combat the nomads.

The question is about which large-scale historical question this relates to. The options are A to J, each a different question. I need to figure out which one matches the scenario presented.

Looking at the options:

A: Silk Road commerce declining after 1500 CE. That doesn't seem related because the passage is about medieval Europe and China, not after 1500.

B: Societies sharing technologies. Not sure, but the passage is more about military strategies and resources.

C: Steppe nomads shaping China's military. That's exactly what the passage says. It's about China's response to a highly mobile steppe nomad.

D: Why Europe and China had different strategies. Hmm, the passage isn't comparing Europe and China; it's about how each group used their resources. So D might be more about the causes than the comparison.

E: Medieval climate affecting cultural diffusion. Not directly related to the topics here.

F: Why European superiority. The passage doesn't discuss why Europe became superior, just the methods used.

G: Gunpowder's influence on wars. The passage says that gunpowder was used in Europe to increase the efficiency of sieges, but Europe used it, China didn't. So this relates to how gunpowder affected military outcomes.

H: Economic status influencing military tech. The passage doesn't mention economic factors, but the focus is on military effectiveness.

J: Gunpowder's development influencing tech. The passage discusses how the development of gunpowder was a factor in Europe's strategy.

Wait, looking at the options, C and G are both possible. Let me read the passage again.

The passage says: Europe used gunpowder for heavy, slow cannons, which were more effective in sieges. China's steppe nomads were highly mobile, so they didn't use gunpowder. So the question is about China's strategy towards steppe nomads, which is option C.

Alternatively, G is about gunpowder's influence on military outcomes in the Middle Ages. But the passage doesn't directly state that gunpowder was the reason for Europe's military success. It says Europe used it, but in the passage, the focus is on the effectiveness of their cannons (so G is a possible answer). But the question is about the geopolitical environment influencing military tech, so H is about that.

Wait, the question is about the argument presented in the passage. The passage argues that Europe used gunpowder (which allowed them to make heavier, slower cannons that were efficient in sieges) and thus invested in developing it. China, on the other hand, faced highly mobile opponents and focused on horse archers. So the argument relates to why China prioritized horse archers over gunpowder, given the threat of steppe nomads. That's exactly what option C says. So the correct answer should be C.

The passage discusses the effectiveness of gunpowder in Europe for heavy, slow cannons and its use in sieges, while China focused on horse archers to combat highly mobile steppe nomads. This highlights China's strategic choice to invest in horse archers over gunpowder, given the threat of nomads. 

**Answer: C**
