H: 2 only
I: 1 and 2 only
J: 2 and 3 only

Okay, so I've got this question about autocorrelation estimates and determining which coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me a sample of autocorrelation coefficients at lags 1, 2, and 3. The coefficients are 0.2, -0.15, and -0.1 respectively. The sample size is 250 data points. They say that the coefficients are approximately normally distributed, so I think that means we're assuming a t-distribution for the coefficients.

First, I remember that in time series analysis, the standard approach when dealing with autocorrelation (like in the Box-Johnson method) involves calculating the coefficients and then determining if they are significantly different from zero. But since the question states that the coefficients are approximately normally distributed, maybe we're not dealing with any issues like heteroskedasticity or non-normality, which would complicate things.

Wait, but without knowing the standard errors, how can we calculate the t-statistics? Oh wait, the question doesn't provide standard errors. So maybe the options are about whether we can determine significance based on the given information. Let me think. The question says that they are approximately normally distributed, but perhaps it implies that we don't have the standard errors. So without standard errors, we can't calculate the t-statistics, which are used to test significance.

So, if the standard errors are not given, we can't compute the t-statistics. That would mean that we can't determine whether any of the coefficients are statistically significant because all we have is the coefficient values. Unless the question is tricking me and maybe there's another way.

Wait, another thought: Autocorrelation coefficients are usually calculated using methods like the Durbin-Watson test or the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure. But the question says they're using 250 data points and they're assuming normal distribution. Hmm.

Let me think about the t-test for coefficients. The t-statistic is calculated as the coefficient divided by the standard error. If the coefficient is, say, 0.2, and the standard error is 0.05, then t = 4. So, in a two-tailed test with 247 degrees of freedom (250-1=249), what's the critical value at 5%? The critical value is about 1.96 for large degrees of freedom, so for a two-tailed test, the critical value is 1.96. If the t-statistic is greater than 1.96 in absolute value, it's significant.

But without standard errors, we can't compute t. So without knowing the standard errors, we can't assess significance. So, the question is whether we can determine significance based on given data. Since the standard errors are not provided, the answer must involve that we can't determine significance.

Looking at the options, option G says: "It is not possible to determine the statistical significance since no standard errors have been given." So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the options don't include G being the correct answer. Let me read the options again. The options are from A to J. Let me check the options:

A: 1, 2, and 3 only

B: All coefficients are significant

C: None are significant

D: 1 and 3 only

E: 1 only

F: 3 only

G: Can't determine because no standard errors

H: 2 only

I: 1 and 2 only

J: 2 and 3 only

So, the correct choice is G. But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The question says "the coefficients are approximately normally distributed." Does that mean their distribution is normal, but we don't know the standard errors? Without standard errors, we can't compute t-statistics. So, without knowing SE, we can't assess significance. So, the correct answer is G.
</think>

The question asks which autocorrelation coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level, given that the coefficients are approximately normally distributed. However, the standard errors (SE) are not provided, making it impossible to calculate the t-statistics required for significance testing. Since the SEs are not given, all we can conclude is that we cannot determine the significance of the coefficients. 

Thus, the correct answer is that it is not possible to determine the statistical significance without the standard errors.

ANSWER: G
