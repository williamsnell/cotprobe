Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything off the top of my head, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about two lenses, A and B. They have equal focal lengths but A is twice the diameter of B. Then there are three parts: part (a) about the energy collected, (b) about the areas of diffraction patterns, and (c) the ratio of energy per unit area in the patterns.

Hmm, I think I remember that the amount of energy collected by a lens is related to the power of the lens. Power is 1/f, where f is the focal length. Since both lenses have the same focal length, their power should be equal. Wait, but wait—what about the size? So if A is twice the diameter of B, does that affect the energy collected? Or is it just the focal length that matters here?

Wait, the question says the diameters are different but the focal lengths are the same. So the power (which determines how much light is collected) is the same for both. So the energy collected (which depends on power) should be the same, right? So the ratio for part (a) would be 1:1. But wait, maybe there's something else. Oh, wait, the power is same, so the energy per unit time is same, but wait, energy collected depends on the intensity and the area. Hmm, no, wait, the power is the same so the energy per unit time is same if they're both collecting light equally. Or maybe the question is considering the area of the lens. No, I think for part (a), the energy collected depends on the power and the time. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify time, so I think part (a)'s ratio is 1:1.

Wait, but am I missing something? I'm a bit unsure about how the size affects it. Let me think again. The power of a lens is 1/f, which is same for both. So the amount of power (which is energy per unit time) is same. But the area of the lens ( aperture area) affects how much light you collect. Because the lens is a lens, not a point, so the amount of light collected depends on the area. So for part (a), the ratio of energy collected by A to B would be (Area_A / Area_B) since their powers are same. Because the power is same, the energy per time is same, but the total energy collected depends on the area. So since A has bigger area, it collects more energy. So energy_A / energy_B = (A_A)/(A_B). Since A's diameter is twice B's, the radius is twice, so area is pi*(2r)^2 = 4 pi r^2, while B's area is pi r^2. So A's area is 4 times B's. So ratio (4:1). So part (a) would be 4:1.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait! Oh, wait, no. The power is same, and the energy collected is the power multiplied by time. But if both lenses are collecting light from the same source, the time is same. So energy is same, but the area is different. So the energy per unit area collected would be (Power) / (Area). Because energy per area is power divided by area. So for part (a), the energy per unit area is same? No, wait, no. Because Power is same, but A has bigger area. So (Power_A)/(Area_A) = (Power_B)/(Area_B). Since A is twice the diameter, Area_A is 4 Area_B. So (Power_A)/(4 Area_B) = (Power_B)/(Area_B). But if they have same power, then (Power)/(4 Area_B) equals (Power)/Area_B. Which would mean (Power)/(Area_A) = (Power)/(4 Area_B). So the energy per unit area is (Energy per area) = Power / Area. So for A: (Power) / (4A), for B: (Power)/(A). So the ratio is (A_A)/(A_B) = 4, so the energy per unit area in A is 1/4 that of B. So if the question is about the energy per unit area, the ratio A:B would be 1:4. But wait, part (a) is about the ratio of energy collected by A to that of B. Oh, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, let's clarify. The question says (a) what is the ratio of energy collected by lens A to that collected by B. But if they're collecting light from the same source, the time is same, so the energy is same only if the power is same. But here, the power is same because their focal lengths are same. So energy collected depends on the area. So for part (a), the energy collected by A is (Area_A) * (Power), and energy collected by B is (Area_B) * Power. So the ratio would be (A_A) / (A_B) = 4. So (a) ratio is 4:1. Hmm, but then earlier I thought the answer for (a) is 4:1, but I'm not sure. Wait, but wait. The problem says: (a) energy collected by A compared to B. If both are using the same light source, then yes, the energy depends on their areas. So ratio is 4:1.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. If the power is same, but the area is larger for A, then the energy per unit area (like in a beam) is same for both. Because energy per area is (Power) / area. Since A's area is 4 times B's, the energy per area is 1/4. So if the question was about energy per unit area, the ratio is 1:4. But the question for part (a) is about the ratio of energy collected. So if the time is same, then the energy is proportional to the area. So for A, energy is (pi r_A^2 * P), and for B, (pi r_B^2 * P). Since r_A is twice r_B, r squared is 4, so E_A = 4 E_B. So the ratio is 4:1.

So part (a) is 4:1.

Then, part (b) is the ratio of the areas of the diffraction patterns. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Diffraction patterns depend on the diameter of the source, but wait, in this case, the setup isn't given. Wait, the setup. Oh, wait, the question doesn't specify whether the lenses are collecting light from a point source or from an extended source. Hmm, the problem says "lenses A and B" but doesn't specify whether the light is coming from a source. If the light is coming from a point source, then the diffraction pattern (like a circular aperture) would have a certain diameter. But if the light is from a source that's a finite size, then the diffraction pattern might be larger or smaller. But without more information, perhaps the problem assumes that the diffraction pattern is determined by the diameter of the lens. Wait, but the question says 'diffraction patterns', which would be from the lens. So the diameter of the diffraction pattern is determined by the lens's size (diameter) and the wavelength of the light. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern (like the Airy disk) has a diameter given by 1.22λ/D, where D is the diameter of the aperture (lens in this case). So if the lens is larger (diameter larger), the diffraction pattern is wider.

So if lens A is twice the diameter of B, then the diffraction pattern of A is twice as wide as that of B. So the ratio of areas (assuming the diffraction pattern is circular) would be (2D)^2 / (D)^2) = 4. So the area ratio is 4:1.

Wait, but wait: the question says (b) the ratio of the areas of the diffraction patterns. So if A's pattern is twice the diameter, then area is (2D)^2 =4 D², while B's is D². So the ratio (A's area)/(B's area) is 4:1. So part (b) would be 4:1.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the question refers to the area based on the lens's diameter. Wait, no, the area of the diffraction pattern is a different story. I think the diffraction pattern's diameter is larger for a larger lens, so the area would be larger. So if A is diameter 2D, B is D, the area of A's pattern is π(2D)^2, B's is π D^2. So ratio is 4:1.

So part (b) is 4:1.

Then part (c) is the ratio of the energy per unit area in the two patterns. So, energy per unit area is power divided by area. So for each pattern, it's (power)/(pattern area). Since both lenses have same power, the energy per unit area would be inversely proportional to the pattern area (which is the diffraction area). So since A's pattern is larger, energy per unit area is (A pattern area) * (Power/A) )?

Wait, no. Let me think: the energy per unit area is (Power) / (pattern area). So for each, E = P / A_pattern. Since P is same for both, the ratio of energy per unit area is (1 / A_A) : (1 / A_B) ) = (A_B : A_A). Since A_A is larger, 1/A_A is smaller than 1/A_B. So the ratio is (1/4) A_B : (1/1) A_A. Wait, no.

Wait, if A_A is 4 times A_B, then 1/A_A is 1/4 of 1/A_B. So for energy per unit area, which is P / A, the ratio (A_A energy per unit area) / (A_B energy per unit area) ) is ( P/(A_A) ) / ( P/(A_B) ) ) = (A_B) / (A_A) ) = (A_B) / (4 A_B) ) = 1/4. So the ratio is A_A energy per unit area : A_B energy per unit area = (P/A_A) : (P/A_B) ) = (1/4 A_B) : (1 A_B) ) → 1:4. Because P/A_A is 1/(4 A_B), and P/A_B is 1/(A_B). So the ratio is (1/(4 A_B)) / (1/(A_B)) ) = 1/4. So the ratio is 1:4.

Wait, but wait. Let me recast it: 

Energy per unit area (E) = Power / Pattern Area.

So E_A = P / A_A.

E_B = P / A_B.

The ratio E_A : E_B = (P/A_A) : (P/A_B) ) = (1/A_A) : (1/A_B) ) = (A_B) : (A_A) ) → since A_A is 4 A_B, this becomes A_B : 4 A_B → 1:4.

So the ratio is 1:4.

Wait, but let me think again: part (c) is the ratio of the energy per unit area in the two patterns. So if A's pattern area is larger, then each unit area in the pattern has less energy. So the energy per unit area in A's pattern is less than that in B's. So E_A is less than E_B. So the ratio E_A : E_B is 1:4.

So combining the three parts:

(a) Energy collected by A to that by B: 4:1.

(b) Area ratio of diffraction patterns: 4:1.

(c) Energy per unit area ratio: 1:4.

Looking at the options:

Option F: 2:1, 1:2, 1:1 → no.

Option G: 2:1, 1:2, 4:1 → no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Because earlier, I thought that part (a) is 4:1, but let me re-examine.

Wait, if the power is same, then the energy collected depends on the area. So if A is 4 times the area of B, then E_A = 4 E_B. So the ratio (A's energy)/(B's energy) is 4:1. So part (a) is 4:1.

But wait, the question says (a) is energy collected by A to that collected by B. So in this case, E_A is 4 times E_B, so ratio is 4:1.

Wait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose the lenses are collecting light from the same source. The luminosity (energy per second) is the same for both because power is same (P = 1/f, same for both). But the time is same. So E = P × t. Since t is same, E is same for both. So the ratio is 1:1. But then, the area is a factor. That's where the confusion comes.

Wait, but no: the question says "energy collected". If the lenses are collecting light from the same source, then yes, same power, same time. So the energy collected is same. But wait, but wait, diameter may affect the beam's divergence. Oh, but the question is about the energy collected, not the beam's intensity. So unless the problem says they're collecting from the same source with same intensity, perhaps the time is same, but the beam's area is different.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify the time. So perhaps the assumption is that the energy collected is the same, but wait, that can't be because the area is different. So without knowing time, it's impossible to determine the energy collected. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption that the problem is considering the beam's intensity (which depends on area) is correct. So energy per unit area is considered.

But perhaps the question is simpler. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that the problem is about the power (energy per second) of the lenses. Both have same focal length, so same power. So the energy per second (power) is same for both. But the question is about the energy collected, which is the power multiplied by the time. If the time is same, then energy collected is same. But without knowing time, perhaps the problem assumes that it's the same light source, so same power and same time, so same energy. So the ratio is 1:1 for part (a). But that contradicts earlier reasoning. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "energy collected by lens A to that collected by lens B." So if both are collecting the same light source, their collected energies would be same. So ratio is 1:1. But then, why does the problem mention the diameters? Because without knowing time, unless the time is same, the energy would be same. Hmm, maybe the problem is assuming that the lenses are collecting from a source that's a point source. So the amount of light per unit area is same, but the beam divergence affects how much energy is collected. But wait, no—wait, if the lenses are collecting light from a point source, then the beam's divergence would affect the amount of flux (energy) collected by each lens. So if A is twice the diameter, it would have a divergent beam that's wider, so perhaps it collects more flux than B.

Ah, this complicates things. So the initial approach was incorrect because it didn't account for the divergence of the beam. So we need to consider the beam's divergence.

Ah, right! Because the problem is likely considering the beam's divergence. So the diameter of the lens (A) is twice that of B, so the beam diverges more. But unless we know the divergence angle, it's hard. Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the beam's divergence such that the area of the beam is the same, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe the problem is simpler and the beam is considered as a point source. So the power (energy per second) is same, and the energy collected is same. So the ratio for part (a) would be 1:1. But that seems to conflict with the initial approach I had.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me read the question again.

The problem states: Two lenses, A and B, have equal focal lengths but A has twice the diameter of B. (a) What is the ratio of energy collected by lens A to that collected by lens B? (b) What is the corresponding ratio of the areas of the diffraction patterns? (c) What is the ratio of the energy per unit area in the two patterns?

So for part (a), the energy collected is likely the power (energy per second) multiplied by the time. So if the same time is used, and same power, then the energies are same. But without that information, perhaps the problem is considering that both lenses are collecting from the same source, so the same power, so same energy. So part (a) ratio is 1:1.

But earlier, I thought that if the energy collected depends on the area, which is 4:1 for A, but that was under the assumption that the time is same. But if the time is same, then the energy would be same. So perhaps the initial assumption is correct, and part (a) ratio is 1:1.

But wait, this seems conflicting with the initial approach. So perhaps I'm confused.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the beam's divergence. The beam diameter of a lens is related to its divergence angle.

The beam's divergence can be approximated by the formula θ ≈ λ/(2D), where D is the lens diameter.

So, if lens A has a diameter twice that of B, then θ_A = λ/(2*(2D)) ) = λ/(4D) = (1/2)(λ/(2D)) ) = (1/2)θ_B.

So θ_A is half of θ_B. So lens A's beam is less divergent than B's.

But the question is about the energy collected. Energy per unit time (power) is same for both.

But the amount of light collected depends on the area of the beam. So A's beam is a circle with diameter 2D, area π(2D)^2 =4πD². B's is π D².

So the area of A's beam is four times that of B's. So if the power is same, the energy collected by A is 4 times that of B. Because Power is energy per second. So if the time is same, then E_A = 4 E_B.

But wait, no, because the beam's area is the area that the lens is illuminating. So if the source is a point source, then the beam from A is a circle of diameter 2D, so the area is 4 π D². So the flux (power) is same, so E_A = Power * t, E_B = same Power * t. So E_A = E_B. Therefore, ratio is 1:1.

But that's conflicting with the earlier thought that the beam's area is larger for A, so the energy collected would be more. But if the time is the same, then no. So perhaps the answer is 1:1 for part (a).

But I'm not confident. Another approach: Perhaps the question is considering the beam's divergence, and thus the beam's area is the same, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the beam's divergence such that the area is same, but that's not given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the beam's area. Maybe the question is about the beam's divergence, and thus the energy per unit area (from the beam) is same. But I'm not sure.

Well, perhaps I should move to the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option F: 2:1, 1:2, 1:1 → No.

Option G: 2:1, 1:2, 4:1 → No.

Option H: 4:1, 1:4, 1:1 → No.

Option I: 1:4, 4:1, 1:1.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the question is assuming that the energy collected is same, but that's not correct because A's beam is larger, but if the time is same, then E_A and E_B are same. But that would imply that the ratio is 1:1.

Wait, but the energy collected by A is 4 times that of B. So part (a) is 4:1.

But earlier, I thought that the energy per unit area is (Power)/(Area). So for A, it's (P)/(4A) and for B, it's (P)/A. So the ratio (A's EA) : (B's EA) is (1/(4A)) ) : (1/A) ) = 1:4.

So part (c) is 1:4.

Wait, but no. Part (c) is the ratio of the energy per unit area in the two patterns. Let me re-express this.

Energy per unit area (E) is P divided by the area of the diffraction pattern. So E_A = P / (A_A) and E_B = P / (A_B). So the ratio E_A : E_B = (1/A_A) : (1/A_B) ) = (A_B) : (A_A).

Since A_A is 4 A_B, then 1/A_A = 1/(4 A_B). So (A_B)/(A_A) = (A_B)/(4 A_B) ) = 1/4. So E_A is 1/4 of E_B.

So part (c) ratio is 1:4.

So for the three parts:

(a) 4:1.

(b) 4:1.

(c) 1:4.

Looking at the options, option F is 2:1, 1:2, 1:1.

Option G is 2:1, 1:2, 4:1.

Option H is 4:1, 1:4, 1:1.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about it again.

Another approach: The question uses the term "energy collected" for part (a). Let's think that if the same amount of light (same power) is being collected into the lenses, then since A is twice the diameter, it's 4 times the area, so it would collect 4 times the energy. So part (a) is 4:1.

For part (c), the energy per unit area in the patterns is the same as (power) / (pattern area). So pattern area is proportional to the square of the lens diameter. So for A, pattern area is 4 A, so energy per unit area is (P)/(4A) = (P/(A)) /4. So the ratio is 1/4. So part (c) is 1:4.

So the three parts are:

(a) 4:1.

(b) 4:1.

(c) 1:4.

Looking at the answer options, which of these match?

Option F: 2:1, 1:2, 1:1 → No.

Option G: 2:1, 1:2, 4:1 → No.

Option H: 4:1, 1:4, 1:1 → Yes! Option H matches.

Wait, wait. Option H is: 4:1, 1:4, 1:1.

Wait, let me check what each option says.

Option H: (a) 4:1, (b) 1:4, (c) 1:1.

Wait, no. Option H says (a) 4:1, (b) 1:4, (c) 1:1. So that's correct. But wait, according to our calculation, (c) is 1:4, which matches option H.

But wait, in the earlier steps, part (c) was 1:4, which is option H.

So the correct option is H.

Wait, no. Let me double-check.

Wait, the answer options are:

A. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

B. 2:1, 1:2, 1:1

C. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

D. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

E. 1:4, 1:4, 1:1

Wait, perhaps I should look again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the correct approach would be:

(a) 4:1.

(b) 4:1.

(c) 1:4.

Looking at the options, option H is that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

B. 2:1, 1:2, 1:1

C. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

D. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

E. 1:4, 1:4, 1:1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b). Let's recalculate.

Part (b): The areas of the diffraction patterns. So if lens A has 2D diameter, and lens B has D diameter. The diffraction pattern's diameter is proportional to the lens's diameter. But the question says, "the ratio of the areas of the diffraction patterns." So if the diameters are 2D and D, then the areas are (pi (2D)^2) and (pi D^2). So ratio is (pi 4D²)/(pi D²) =4:1.

So part (b) is 4:1.

Part (c): The energy per unit area in the patterns. So E_A is (P) / (4 pi D²), E_B is (P)/(pi D²). So the ratio E_A : E_B is (P/(4 pi D²)) : (P/(pi D²)) ) → (1/(4 pi D²)) : (1/(pi D²)) → (1/4) : 1 → 1:4.

So part (c) is 1:4.

So the three parts are:

(a) 4:1,

(b) 4:1,

(c) 1:4.

Looking at the options, option H is 4:1, 1:4, 1:1. So option H is correct.

Wait, but in the earlier part (c) calculation, I thought it was 1:4, which is option H.

So the correct answer is option H.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the options don't have option H correctly.

Wait, no, the options are:

A. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

B. 2:1, 1:2, 1:1

C. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

D. 4:1, 1:2, 1:1

E. 1:4, 1:4, 1:1.

Wait, option E is 1:4, 1:4, 1:1. Option H is 4:1, 1:4, 1:1.

So our correct answer is option H, which is (a) 4:1, (b) 4:1, (c) 1:4.

So the answer is option H.
</think>

The problem involves two lenses, A and B, with equal focal lengths but A having twice the diameter of B. The goal is to determine the ratios for energy collected, diffraction patterns, and energy per unit area in the patterns.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Energy Collected (Part a):**
   - Both lenses have the same focal length, implying the same power (energy per second).
   - Unless the time is specified, the energy collected depends on the area of the lens.
   - Lens A has a diameter twice that of B, so its area is \(4\) times that of B.
   - Therefore, if the time is the same, the energy collected by A is \(4\) times that of B.
   - **Ratio (a): \(4:1\).**

2. **Diffraction Patterns (Part b):**
   - The diffraction pattern's diameter is proportional to the lens's diameter.
   - Lens A has a diameter twice that of B, so its diffraction pattern is \(2\) times wider than B's.
   - The area of a diffraction pattern is proportional to the square of its diameter.
   - Lens A's diffraction pattern area is \(4\) times that of B's.
   - **Ratio (b): \(4:1\).**

3. **Energy Per Unit Area in Patterns (Part c):**
   - Energy per unit area is the power divided by the pattern area.
   - For A, the energy per unit area is \(P / (4 \times \text{Area of B})\).
   - For B, the energy per unit area is \(P / (\text{Area of B})\).
   - The ratio of energy per unit area for A to B is \((P / (4 \times \text{Area of B})) : (P / (\text{Area of B}))\).
   - Simplifying, this ratio becomes \(1:4\).
   - **Ratio (c): \(1:4\).**

### Final Answer:

The ratios are:
- (a) \(4:1\),
- (b) \(4:1\),
- (c) \(1:4\).

From the provided options, the correct choice is **Option H**, which matches these ratios.

ANSWER: H
