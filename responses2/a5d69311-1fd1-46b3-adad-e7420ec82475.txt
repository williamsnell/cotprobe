Question:

Mosquitoes resistant to the pesticide DDT first appeared in India in 1959 within 15 years of widespread spraying of the insecticide. Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?

Options:

A: The mosquitoes reproduced at such a fast rate that they evolved to become resistant to DDT.
B: Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.
C: Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.
D: The mosquitoes developed a resistance because the DDT used was of a lesser concentration.
E: The mosquitoes developed a resistance to DDT over time due to constant exposure.
F: DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.
G: The resistant mosquitoes were imported from a different area where DDT was not used.
H: All the mosquitoes were initially resistant to DDT, but the resistant ones were better at surviving.
I: Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.
J: The mosquitoes were initially resistant to DDT, but due to a mutation, they lost their resistance.

Okay, so I have this question about mosquitoes and pesticides. Hmm, I need to find out why mosquitoes became resistant to DDT in India after a certain period. Let me think.

The question says that mosquitoes resistant to DDT first appeared in India in 1959, and this happened within 15 years of spraying. So the exposure was recent.

Looking at the options, the question is about how the resistance arose. I need to figure out the best explanation.

Option A says the mosquitoes reproduced quickly and evolved. That makes sense because evolution happens over time, but it's about how quickly they evolved. But the timeframe is in 1959, which is a few years post-spraying. So maybe A is possible.

Option B says DDT isn't effective against mosquitoes. But that's not true, right? I remember that DDT is a common insecticide used effectively against mosquitoes. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Some mosquitoes got a mutation exposed to DDT and became resistant. Then they started surviving. That could be possible. But wait, I'm not sure if mutations are the main way in nature. Or perhaps the question refers to natural mutation. But I'm not sure about that.

Option D: Mosquitoes developed resistance because the DDT used was less. That doesn't make sense. The DDT used would be the same over time, so the effectiveness should be similar. So D is unlikely.

Option E: mosquitoes developed resistance over time because of exposure. That's plausible. As the population grows, more mosquitoes are exposed to DDT, and some mutate and become resistant. Over many years, some would accumulate resistance and start dominating the population.

Option F: DDT is very effective. No, that's not correct. So F is wrong.

Option G: imported from another area where DDT wasn't used. That's possible, but I'm not sure if that's the best explanation. The fact that it appeared in India suggests it was introduced there, perhaps, but why would it take that long.

Option H: All mosquitoes were resistant, but the good ones survived. But that doesn't fit because the question is about development of resistance.

Option I: Some were already resistant, then all susceptible were gone. So that would mean that in the population, the resistant ones outcompete the others. But why? That could happen, but it's a bit more complex. Like, if the resistant ones reproduce faster, they become more dominant. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Option J: Mosquitoes were initially resistant, but mutation led to loss. That sounds like natural selection against the resistant, but that might not explain a quick development.

Wait, the question is which statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose. So, the key is the mechanism of their evolution.

I remember that the development of resistance in mosquitoes is often due to mutations. So, some mosquitoes might have a mutation that confers resistance. Or perhaps the environment introduced certain mutations.

Option A says they evolved quickly. But I'm not sure if that's the best or only explanation. But it's a possibility.

Option E says they developed resistance due to continuous exposure. That's more about selection, not necessarily evolution. But the question is about the mechanism of their development, not just survival.

Wait, another angle: DDT is a synthetic pesticide. When used in areas where it's effective, it's more likely to kill the mosquitoes. But if the population has some mutations that confer resistance, then those mosquitoes survive better. So over time, as the population grows, more mosquitoes have the resistance. Those with resistance can reproduce better, leading to their population increasing. But that's more about the process of adaptation, not just exposure leading to some developing resistance.

So, if DDT was used, and the mosquitoes had mutations, those that could survive better with DDT (i.e., resistant) would increase in number. So that's directional selection. But how quickly did that happen?

Wait, the question is about how the resistant mosquitoes arose. So the process of their development (why they became resistant) would involve mutations.

So, option A says they evolved quickly. That's about the rate of evolution. But I'm not certain if that's the best explanation.

Option E says they developed resistance over time due to exposure. That's about the process of natural selection as exposure leads to some mosquitoes being selected for.

So which is more the correct explanation? The question is about the mechanism how the resistance arose, i.e., the cause of their development.

Another thought: Mosquitoes may have acquired resistance mutations over time. So the process is that the exposure leads to some mosquitoes that can survive better, and over time, these become more common in the population.

But the options don't seem to include that. So I have to choose between the given options.

Looking at the options again, the best fit is likely option E. Because exposure over time would lead to some mosquitoes being resistant, which could then increase in number, leading to their population becoming dominant. So the mosquitoes' resistance developed over time because of the exposure, not necessarily through mutations.

Wait, but why did they develop it quickly in 1959? That's the timeframe. So perhaps the answer is E, because the selection over time leads to the development of resistance.

Alternatively, option A suggests that the mosquitoes evolved quickly, but what's the mechanism? Mutation is the key. So the correct answer may be E or A.

Wait, the question is about how the resistant mosquitoes arose. So the correct answer would be about the mechanism of their development.

If the question is about the process of development, then the correct answer would be E. Because exposure over time allows for some mosquitoes to survive better, which increases their chances of reproduction and thus their population's increase. But that seems more about the process of natural selection rather than evolution. However, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, if it's about the rate of development, perhaps E is the correct because it's about the selection over time, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: DDT is a synthetic agent. When it's introduced, some of the mosquitoes that can survive better with it (the resistant ones) will dominate. So over the years, the resistant ones become more prevalent.

But why did they develop resistance quickly in 1959? That's the timeframe. So perhaps the answer is E, because the selection over time leads to the development of resistance.

Alternatively, option A suggests that the mosquitoes evolved quickly, but what's the reason for that? If the environment changed and there was mutation, then some mosquitoes could have developed resistance.

But I think the correct answer is E: the mosquitoes developed resistance over time due to exposure. Because the question is about the mechanism of their development, which is about natural selection, not mutation.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think about the biological process. Mosquitoes that have mutations that confer resistance to DDT will survive better, leading to their population growing faster. Over time, this can lead to the accumulation of resistance in the population.

But the question is about how the mosquitoes arose to be resistant. So the process is selection. So maybe the correct answer is E.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is A, because they quickly evolved.

Hmm. Another approach: The first study on DDT's use in mosquitoes. I remember that in 1959, after spraying, some mosquitoes became resistant. The first study to show that DDT caused a mutation leading to resistance. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the options, the correct answer is E because it's about the process of selection over time leading to some mosquitoes becoming resistant.

Wait, but the question is about the mechanism of how the mosquitoes developed resistance. So the correct answer would be E, as the exposure led to selection for resistant mosquitoes.

Alternatively, I'm getting more uncertain. Maybe the best answer is E: because the exposure over time leads to some mosquitoes being resistant, which then increase in population, leading to their development.

Wait, but the option says that they "developed a resistance because the DDT used was of a lesser concentration." That doesn't make sense because the DDT used is the same as when it was sprayed. So E is saying that over time, due to exposure, they developed resistance.

So, the correct answer is E.

The question asks about the mechanism by which mosquitoes became resistant to DDT in India in 1959, following widespread spraying. The best explanation must relate to the process of how resistance arose.

- **Option A**: The idea that the mosquitoes "evolved" to become resistant is plausible, but it doesn't fully explain the mechanism. Evolution typically involves mutations, not just the speed of the process.

- **Option B**: Incorrect. DDT is a highly effective insecticide, so it's not effective against mosquitoes.

- **Option C**: Suggests some mosquitoes developed resistance through mutation after exposure. While mutations can lead to resistance, the question emphasizes the process of development, not just mutation.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The DDT used is the same as the one sprayed, so its effectiveness is consistent over time.

- **Option E**: Correct. The development of resistance over time due to exposure to DDT makes sense. Mosquitoes with mutations that confer resistance to DDT are better at surviving and reproducing, leading to their population's increase over time.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. DDT is not very effective, so it's not about manufacturing issues.

- **Option G**: Suggests importation, but the question suggests DDT was introduced, not imported.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. All mosquitoes being resistant does not explain the selective survival of resistant ones.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The process of mutual selection doesn't explain the quick development of resistance.

- **Option J**: Incorrect. While some mosquitoes were resistant, this doesn't explain the rapid development.

The best explanation is **E**, as it aligns with the process of natural selection over time, where exposure to DDT led to the accumulation of mutations that confer resistance.
