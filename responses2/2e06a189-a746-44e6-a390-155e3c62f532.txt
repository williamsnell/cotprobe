Okay, so I've got this problem here. Mr. Josephson put $200 in a savings account that earns 4% interest, compounded semiannually. I need to find the present value after 2 years. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is asking for the present value. Hmm, but wait, the problem says he put $200 in the account, so I think I might be confusing present value and future value here. Let me read it again.

Wait, the question says, "Find the present value of his account after 2 years." Wait, that doesn't make sense because the present value is the current value of a future sum. But if the account is earning interest, the present value should be the amount you would need to invest now to have $200 in 2 years. Wait, but the question is phrased as if the account is growing, so maybe I'm looking for the future value. Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me see.

Wait, no, the question says "Find the present value of his account after 2 years." Wait, that would mean the present value at the end of 2 years. Wait, but that's not how present value works. Oh, maybe I got it backwards. Let me think. The present value is the value today, given a future value, so if the account is growing, the present value would be the amount that, if invested, would grow to $200 in 2 years.

Wait, but the problem says he put $200 in the account, which is the present value. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the future value, not the present value. Because the present value of $200 after 2 years would be less than $200, but the question says "present value of his account," which might mean the present value at the time when the account is used, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the question is correctly stated. Let me re-read the question. It says, "Mr. Josephson put $200 in a savings account which receives 4% interest compounded semiannually. Find the present value of his account after 2 years."

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the present value is the current value. So if the account is growing, the present value would be less than $200. But the question says "present value of his account after 2 years," which is a bit confusing. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the future value after 2 years, but it's labeled as present value. That seems unlikely. So maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the question is asking for the future value, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick question.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct. Let me think again: "Find the present value of his account after 2 years." But present value is the value today, so the account is growing, meaning the present value is less than $200. But the options are all above $200. Wait, no, the options are all different. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options: A is $212.36, B is $220.50, and so on. Wait, but the present value is likely less than $200 because it's the value today. But all the options are higher than $200. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says, "Find the present value of his account after 2 years." Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the question is asking for the present value at the end of 2 years, which would be the original $200. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the future value, but stated as present value. That doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. Let me clarify: present value is the value today, future value is the value at a certain time in the future. So if the account is growing at 4% compounded semiannually, then the present value (today) would be less than $200. But the options given are all higher than $200. So perhaps the question is actually asking for the present value, but it's a trick. Alternatively, maybe the question is correctly worded, and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct, and I should proceed. Let's think about the formula. The future value is calculated as:

FV = PV * (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- FV is the future value,
- PV is the present value,
- r is the annual interest rate,
- n is the number of times interest is compounded per year,
- t is the time in years.

But the question is asking for the present value, not the future value. So perhaps I should find the present value given the future value and the time and rate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe the question is a setup for the present value, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the options are all present values after 2 years. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, no, because the present value is $200, which is the starting point. If the interest is being earned, the present value is $200, but the options are showing higher amounts, which suggests that perhaps the question is asking for the future value, but the options are labeled as present values. That seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: "Find the present value of his account after 2 years." So the account is growing, so the present value would be the initial amount that leads to the account growing to a certain amount in the future. But since the present value is given as $200, perhaps the question is a trick, and the answer is $200, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the options are present values, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the future value. Let me think: If we calculate the future value of $200 at 4% compounded semiannually for 2 years, that would be the amount at the end of 2 years. Let's compute that.

First, the rate per period: 4% per annum, compounded semiannually, so each period is 6 months. So n = 2 periods per year, t=2 years. So the formula is:

FV = 200 * (1 + 0.04/2)^(2*2) = 200*(1 + 0.02)^4.

Calculating that: 1.02^4 is approximately 1.08243216. So 200 * 1.08243216 = 216.486432, which is approximately $216.49. Looking at the options, that's E: $216.49.

Wait, so the present value would be $200, but the question says "present value after 2 years," which would be the future value, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the options are all present values. Wait, no, because the present value is the initial amount, so it's $200. But all the options are higher than $200.

Wait, perhaps the question is misworded, and it's actually asking for the future value. Because the options are all higher than $200. So perhaps the correct answer is E: $216.49.

Wait, but the question clearly says present value. Hmm. Maybe the question is correct, and I'm being tricked, but I don't see how. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to say the future value. But given the options, the calculation I did for future value is E: $216.49.
</think>

The question asks for the present value of an account that will have $200 after 2 years, compounded semiannually at 4%. However, the options are all higher than $200, which suggests the question might be misworded. If we interpret the question as asking for the future value, the calculation gives $216.49, which corresponds to option E. 

Answer: E: $216.49
