Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about two statements related to free abelian groups, and I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

First, let me understand what a free abelian group is. From what I remember, a free abelian group is an abelian group that has a basis, much like how vector spaces have bases. The basis is a set of elements such that every element in the group can be uniquely expressed as a finite linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients. So, in other words, a free abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the integers ℤ.

Now, Statement 1 says: "Every free abelian group is torsion-free." Torsion-free means that the only element of finite order is the identity element. In other words, there are no non-identity elements in the group that have finite order. So, if a group is torsion-free, no element except the identity can be raised to some integer power and still be the identity. 

Wait, but free abelian groups do have no torsion because their basis consists of torsion elements (since each element can be written as a multiple of a basis element, which is order 1, so no torsion). So Statement 1 should be true. 

Moving on to Statement 2: "Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group." Hmm, so a finitely generated group means that its underlying set can be expressed as a finite combination of generators. Torsion-free means no non-identity element has finite order. 

I remember that for finitely generated abelian groups, there's a theorem called the structure theorem which classifies them. It says that every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups. But specifically, for torsion-free groups, the cyclic components must be infinite cyclic. So, a finitely generated torsion-free abelian group would be a direct sum of a finite number of copies of ℤ. That is, it's free abelian. 

Wait, but can any finitely generated torsion-free abelian group be expressed as a free abelian group? Yes, because if it's finitely generated and torsion-free, all its torsion components must be trivial, so they're free. So Statement 2 should also be true.

Wait, but wait a second. Isn't there a difference between finitely generated and countably generated? No, in this case, the statement says "finitely generated." So, according to the structure theorem, yes. So both statements are true.

Looking back at the options:

Option I is "True, True," which would be the answer. But wait, let me cross-verify. Statement 2: Is every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group free? Yes. So both statements are correct. So the correct option is I: True, True.

Wait, but let me think again. Statement 2 says "every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group." Since finitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free, yes. So both are true.

Looking at the options, option I says both are true. So the correct answer should be I: True, True. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J. Looking at the options:

Option I: True, True. So that's the one.

The correct answer is I: True, True.
