Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mary O'Grady's earnings for the week. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, she worked 44 hours during a regular week, which is Monday to Friday. Then she worked 4.5 hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday. The question says that time and a half is paid for all hours over 40 during the regular week. Also, double time is paid for all Sunday hours. Her regular rate is $3.10 an hour. I need to find her gross earnings for the week and pick the correct option.

Hmm, let me break this down. Regular hours are Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. She worked 44 hours total, but I think that's all during the regular week. So, regular hours would be 44 hours minus any Saturday or Sunday hours? Wait, no. Wait, the regular week is Monday-Friday, so any hours worked on Saturday and Sunday are considered extra time, not part of the regular week.

So, let's see. She worked 44 regular hours (Monday-Friday). But wait, 44 hours is 40 regular hours plus 4 hours? Because 40 is a regular week, and 4 hours over 40. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 44 hours in a regular week? Wait, no. Wait, the regular week is Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the regular hours she worked would be 44 hours during that 5-day week. So, 44 hours. But 40 is regular, so 4 hours over 40. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 44 hours in a regular week? Wait, the problem says she worked 44 hours during a regular week (Monday-Friday). So that's 44 regular hours.

Wait, but 44 hours in a 5-day week? No, that's not possible because each day can't have more than 8 hours, I think. But perhaps that's just the calculation, not the real-world scenario. So, let's proceed.

So, her regular pay is $3.10 per hour. So, for regular hours, she gets $3.10 per hour for the first 40 hours. Any hours over 40 are paid at time and a half, which is 1.5 times the regular rate. So, let's calculate that.

Her regular hours are 44. So, the first 40 are at $3.10, and the remaining 4 hours are time and a half.

So, regular pay calculation: 40 * $3.10 + 4 * (1.5 * $3.10).

Let me compute that. 40 * 3.10 is 124. 4 * (1.5*3.10) is 4 * 4.65 = 18.60. So, total regular pay is 124 + 18.60 = 142.60.

Wait, but wait, that's just the regular pay. Then we have Saturday and Sunday hours.

On Saturday, she worked 4.5 hours, which are paid at time and a half. So, 4.5 * 1.5 * 3.10.

And on Sunday, 3 hours, paid at double time. So 3 * 2 * 3.10.

So, let's compute each part.

First, Saturday's pay: 4.5 * 1.5 = 6.75. 6.75 * 3.10. Let's compute 6 * 3.10 = 18.60. 0.75 *3.10= 2.325. So total Saturday pay is 18.60 + 2.325 = 20.925.

Sunday's pay: 3 * 2 = 6. 6 * 3.10 = 18.60.

So, total pay is the sum of regular pay, Saturday pay, and Sunday pay.

Wait, but let me check: regular pay was 142.60, plus 20.925 for Saturday, plus 18.60 for Sunday.

Wait, 142.60 + 20.925 = 163.525. Plus 18.60: 163.525 +18.60 = 182.125.

So, approx $182.13.

Looking at the options, option D is $182.13.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the regular pay calculation. 44 regular hours at $3.10 and any over 40.

Wait, 44 regular hours. 40 at $3.10, 4 at 1.5*3.10.

40 *3.10 = 124.

4 * (3.10 *1.5) = 4 *4.65= 18.60.

Total regular: 124 +18.60= 142.60.

Saturday: 4.5 hours at 1.5 rate.

1.5 *3.10=4.65 per hour. 4.5 *4.65.

Let me compute 4 *4.65=18.60, 0.5 *4.65=2.325. Sum: 20.925.

Sunday: 3 hours at double time.

Double time is 2 *3.10 =6.20 per hour. 3 *6.20=18.60.

So total pay is 142.60 +20.925 +18.60.

Wait, 142.60 +20.925 is 163.525. Plus 18.60 is 182.125, which is $182.13.

So that's option D.

To determine Mary's gross earnings, we break down the hours and calculate pay for each segment:

1. **Regular Hours (Monday-Friday):** 44 hours at $3.10/hour.
   - Regular pay: \(40 \times 3.10 = 124\) dollars.
   - Overtime (hours over 40): \(4 \times (1.5 \times 3.10) = 4 \times 4.65 = 18.60\) dollars.

2. **Saturday Hours:** 4.5 hours at 1.5 times the regular rate.
   - Saturday pay: \(4.5 \times (1.5 \times 3.10) = 4.5 \times 4.65 = 20.925\) dollars.

3. **Sunday Hours:** 3 hours at double time.
   - Sunday pay: \(3 \times (2 \times 3.10) = 3 \times 6.20 = 18.60\) dollars.

**Total Gross Earnings:**  
- Regular pay + Saturday pay + Sunday pay  
- \(124 + 18.60 + 20.925 + 18.60 = 182.125\) dollars.

Rounded to two decimal places, Mary's gross earnings are $182.13.
