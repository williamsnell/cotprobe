Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about a box on an inclined plane as the angle increases. I need to determine what happens to the normal force.

Hmm, I remember that when an object is on an inclined plane, the normal force is the force perpendicular to the surface. Oh right, because the plane is inclined, the normal force changes depending on the angle. 

Wait, what's the formula again? I think the normal force (N) is given by N = mg cos(theta), where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and theta is the angle of the incline from the horizontal. Oh, right, because as the angle increases, the component of gravity perpendicular to the plane decreases.

So if theta increases, cos(theta) decreases. Because cosine of an angle is highest at 0 degrees (flat surface) and decreases as the angle goes up. So as the plane becomes steeper, the normal force should decrease.

Looking at the options, option B says it decreases linearly. But wait, cos(theta) decreases nonlinearly. The rate of decrease depends on the cosine function, which is a non-linear decrease. So the normal force doesn't just decrease at a constant rate; it drops more steeply as the angle increases.

What about option J? That says the normal force does not change. No, that's not right because as theta increases, cos(theta) changes, so N changes.

Option F says it remains constant until a certain angle, then decreases linearly. That doesn't make sense because the normal force is always dependent on theta. It's not a flat line; it's a curve that gets smaller as the angle increases.

So the correct behavior is that the normal force decreases, but not linearly. So looking at the options, which ones say that. 

Option B says decreases linearly. I don't think that's correct because the rate of decrease is not linear. The function is cos(theta), which is a non-linear decrease. So it's not linear.

Option E and I are about exponential decrease. I remember that the normal force is proportional to cos(theta), which is a trigonometric function, not exponential. So E and I don't fit.

Option J is wrong. 

So the options left are C, D, F, and B. Wait, F says it remains constant until a certain angle, which is incorrect because it's not constant.

Option C: first increases, then decreases. No, because as theta increases, the angle from horizontal increases, so cos(theta) decreases. So N decreases, not increases. So C isn't right.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. When the angle is 0 degrees, cosine is 1, so N is max. As the angle increases, N decreases. So the normal force is always decreasing. So the correct behavior is that it decreases, but not linearly. So which option matches that?

Looking back, option B says decreases linearly. No, but in reality, the decrease is not linear. So which option correctly reflects the behavior?

Wait, but let me look at the options again. 

Option C: first increases, then decreases. That would imply a peak, but no, as the angle increases, it's decreasing. So C is incorrect.

Option F says remains constant until a certain angle then decreases linearly. That's incorrect because it's not a constant.

So the correct behavior is that the normal force decreases, but not linearly. So what's the correct option?

Looking at the options, perhaps option B is the intended answer. Wait, but the problem is about whether it decreases linearly. Since the decrease is not linear, perhaps the answer is E or I.

Wait, another way to think: the normal force is proportional to cos(theta), which is a non-linear function. So the decrease is not linear. So the correct option is E or I, but I don't think so because the change isn't exponential.

Wait, but the problem is about the behavior of the normal force as theta increases. So as theta increases, cos(theta) decreases. The decrease is as theta increases, cos(theta) decreases, so N decreases, but not linearly. So which option says that N decreases and not linearly.

Looking at the options:

Option E: decreases nonlinearly. That's correct because it's proportional to cos(theta), which is a non-linear function.

Wait, but the options are E, I, etc. So option E is about the normal force decreases nonlinearly. So that would be correct.

Wait, let me recheck. The options are:

A: oscillates... no, no.

B: decreases linearly... no.

C: first increases, then decreases. No.

D: decreases exponentially... no.

E: decreases nonlinearly. Yes, because it's proportional to cos(theta), which is non-linear.

F: remains... no.

G: increases... no.

H: increases... no.

I: increases... no.

J: no change... no.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The normal force on an inclined plane is given by \( N = mg \cos(\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle of inclination from the horizontal. As \( \theta \) increases, \( \cos(\theta) \) decreases, causing the normal force to decrease. However, the decrease is not linear because \( \cos(\theta) \) is a non-linear function. Therefore, the normal force decreases, but it does so in a nonlinear manner.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, F, G, H, J**: Incorrect. These options describe scenarios that do not match the behavior of the normal force as \( \theta \) increases.
- **D**: Incorrect. Exponential decrease is not applicable here because the normal force decreases proportionally to \( \cos(\theta) \), not exponentially.
- **E**: Correct. The normal force decreases nonlinearly as \( \theta \) increases.
- **I**: Incorrect. The normal force does not increase as \( \theta \) increases.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.
