Okay, so I have this question about the main fuel for muscle contraction during intense activities like sprinting. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that during intense exercise, the body needs a lot of energy. Muscle contraction is definitely a big part of that. But what's the main fuel here? The options are various substances, so I need to figure out which one is the primary fuel.

I know that when your muscles use energy, it's often glucose because it's the main fuel for carbohydrates. But wait, during intense activity, especially in sprinting, the body might not be relying solely on glucose. I've heard about something called glycogen, which is a form of stored energy.

Plasma glucose (option H) is the blood sugar level, so it's about energy in the body. But during intense activity, the cells might be using glucose for muscle work. On the other hand, muscle glycogen (option C) is stored in the muscle cells, right? So when you need energy, your body breaks down muscle glycogen rather than relying on plasma glucose.

Wait, but during intense exercise, the cells might start breaking down their own glycogen to meet the demands. So when you're running, your muscles need a lot of energy, so they'll break down muscle glycogen from inside. That makes sense because muscle glycogen is the stored form that would be released for use during exercise.

So, the main fuel for muscle contraction would be muscle glycogen, which is option C. The other options: plasma lactate is from lactate accumulation, which is a secondary energy source. Liver glycogen is also a stored form but maybe used during recovery. Ingested carbohydrates are more about what you eat, but if you're on a diet, that's different. Muscle protein (D) and amino acids (I) are components of muscles but not the primary fuel. Muscle triacylglycerol (G) is a lipid, not directly the fuel. VLDL is a type of lipoprotein, not fuel.

So the correct answer should be C: Muscle glycogen.

The main fuel for muscle contraction during intense activities like sprinting is **muscle glycogen**. This is because muscle glycogen is the stored form of energy within the muscle cells that is released to meet the energy demands of exercise. During intense activity, the body may break down muscle glycogen as a primary energy source. 

Answer: C
