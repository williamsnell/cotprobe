The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A bank teller was on trial for embezzlement. The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?

Options:

A: Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.
B: No, because the records are considered public documents and do not need further authentication.
C: No, because the defense did not provide any counter evidence to dispute the records.
D: Yes, because the prosecution must also prove the bank teller had access to manipulate these records.
E: Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.
F: No, because the records are self-authenticating and do not require additional proof of authenticity.
G: No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.
H: Yes, because the prosecution failed to provide a chain of custody for the records.
I: No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.
J: Yes, because the records must be certified by a public official, not just a bank employee.

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about whether certain bank records are admissible in a trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that a bank teller is on trial for embezzlement, which means the bank used funds for personal expenses. The prosecution presented their daily deposit and tally records over six months. They wanted to show that the total deposits didn't match the funds received and recorded. But the defense objected because they tried to enter the records without the testimony of a bank custodian.

The question is whether the court will order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity. The options are from A to J, each giving different reasons.

First, I remember that hearsay is when a statement is made in evidence that can be proven by other evidence. For business records, under the Federal Rules of Evidence 8, they have an exception to hearsay called business records kept regularly. These records are considered enough in themselves, so they don't need to be certified or verified by a third party unless the record is kept for a significant time or there's a good chance of fraud.

Looking at the options, option F says the records are self-authenticating and don't need further proof. That aligns with what I just thought. Business records kept regularly fall under the exception and can be admitted without additional certification. So the defense's objection here is based on trying to enter the records without someone's involvement, which doesn't apply if they're regular records.

But wait, option G says business records kept on a regular basis are allowed without qualification. So both F and G seem relevant, but I'm trying to recall which rule applies here. The rule for business records kept regularly is that they are admissible without further proof, so option F is correct. Option G's wording is similar but phrased a bit differently.

Another point: the question says the defense tried to enter the records without the testimony of a bank custodian. Since the records are business records kept regularly, they don't need that unless there's a good chance of fraud or it's a very significant time. So the defense's argument might not be valid.

So the court would likely admit the records without needing further proof. The correct answer there would be option F. Alternatively, option G is another way to state the same thing, but I think F is the more direct answer. So looking at the options, F is an option (F: No, because the records are self-authenticating and do not require further authentication).

The correct answer is F. The bank's daily deposit and tally records, being business records kept regularly, fall under the Federal Rules of Evidence 8, Rule 704, which allows them to be admitted without additional proof of authenticity. 

Answer: F: No, because the records are self-authenticating and do not require further authentication.
