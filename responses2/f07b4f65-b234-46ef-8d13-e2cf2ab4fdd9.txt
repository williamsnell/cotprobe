Question:

Four years ago the owner of a shopping center leased a store in the center for a 10-year term to a pharmacistfor use as a drugstore. The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel wasimproved with a building that, at the time of the owner's purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied inpart by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assignedto the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine themso that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the ownerplanned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore. The pharmacist protested the proposed new lease, but the owner declared his intention to go forward with it. The pharmacist brought an appropriate action to enjoin the new lease to the discount drugstore as a violationof the covenant in the pharmacist's lease. If the court finds for the owner, what will be the likely reason?

Options:

A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.
B: The owner's purchase and integration of the adjacent parcel of land effectively nullifies the existing covenant.
C: The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist firstentered into the lease.
D: The discount drugstore on the adjacent parcel is not considered a 'new' lease, but a continuation of an existing one.
E: A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant wascreated.
F: The owner has the right to lease any part of his property to any business, regardless of existing leases.
G: The pharmacist did not adequately express his concerns to the owner before initiating legal action.
H: A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with theland.
I: The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shoppingcenter premises.
J: The covenant is not applicable as the shopping centers were considered separate entities at the time of the lease agreement.

Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a lease agreement between a pharmacist and a shopping center. The pharmacist leased the shopping center for 10 years, and that's the original agreement. Now, some time ago, the owner bought an adjacent parcel of land and built a new building there. This new building has a lease with a discount drugstore that was already in place before. The owner was planning to lease that space to another drugstore once again, and the pharmacist is suing the owner for enjoining that new lease, saying it's a violation of the original covenant.

So, the problem is about whether the owner's new lease with the discount drugstore is a violation of the original covenant set in the pharmacist's lease. The options given are A through J, each with different legal interpretations or principles.

I need to determine the likely reason why the court would find the owner's action in favor of the pharmacist. Let me think about the facts step by step.

First, the initial covenant in the pharmacist's lease was that the owner wouldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. The owner leased the entire shopping center to the pharmacist for 10 years. Now, the owner bought an adjacent parcel of land. He built a new building there, which had a lease with a discount drugstore. The original owner of that drugstore had a lease with the owner of the shopping center for ten years, I suppose, because the original term was 10 years and the new one was also for ten years.

The owner is planning to lease the new area to another drugstore, and the pharmacist is suing for the new lease to be unenforceable because it's a violation of the original covenant.

Now, the key issue is whether the new lease with the discount drugstore is a violation of the original covenant that the owner made. So, the court is probably looking at whether the new lease is a continuation or a violation of the prior covenant.

I remember that in common law, when a covenant is made, it can be modified, extended, or void. Also, if a new lease is made with land that was already leased, it's possible that the original covenant is still in place, and the new one might be a violation.

Wait, but the owner bought the new parcel and integrated both shopping centers. So, when the owner's new lease is made with the discount drugstore, the drugstore's lease was with the original owner's previous owner. The original owner's previous owner had a ten-year lease with the current owner. Now, the new owner is planning to lease the area, and the new lease includes the drugstore's original lease.

But the original covenant was that the owner wouldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, if the new lease includes the drugstore's original ten-year lease, is that a violation?

I think the key here is that the new lease is extending the original covenant. The original covenant was that the owner couldn't lease to another drugstore. The new lease includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore. If the original owner's previous owner had a ten-year lease with the current owner, then the new lease is a continuation of that original covenant.

Wait, but the new lease includes the original owner's previous lease with the current owner. So, the new lease is with a different drugstore, not the same one. So, would that be a violation?

Alternatively, perhaps the original covenant was that the owner couldn't lease any part of the center to another drugstore. If the owner is now leasing another drugstore, that's a violation. But perhaps the original owner's previous lease was with the current owner, and the current owner is now leasing another drugstore, which is a violation of the original covenant.

Wait, no. The original covenant was that the owner wouldn't lease any part of the shopping center to "another drugstore." So, when the owner bought the new parcel, he integrated it with the existing shopping center. Now, the new lease is with a different drugstore. So, is that a violation of the original covenant?

Or, perhaps the original covenant was that the owner couldn't lease the entire shopping center to "another drugstore." So, if the owner is now leasing another drugstore, that's a violation of the original covenant.

In that case, the new lease is a violation. But I'm not sure if the court would hold that it's a violation because the new lease includes the original drugstore's ten-year lease, which was part of the initial setup.

Wait, no, because the new lease includes the original owner's previous lease with the current owner, but the original covenant was about the owner not leasing the entire center to another drugstore. So, maybe the court would say that the new lease includes the original owner's ten-year lease, which was part of the original covenant.

Wait, perhaps the original covenant was that the owner couldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the new lease includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore. That would be a violation because the drugstore is a different business, and the original covenant was about the owner not leasing to another drugstore. So, the new lease is a violation of the original covenant.

But wait, the owner's new lease is with a different drugstore. So, is the original covenant about the owner not leasing to another drugstore, or about the owner not leasing any part of the center to another drugstore?

The wording is that the owner would not lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the entire shopping center is part of the property, and the owner is leasing it. So, if the new lease includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore, that's a violation because the original covenant was about the owner not leasing the center to another drugstore.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. The original covenant was about the owner not leasing any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the new lease is with a different drugstore, which is a violation of the original covenant.

Alternatively, perhaps the new lease is a new lease for a part of the shopping center, but the original covenant was about the entire shopping center. So, if the owner is now leasing another drugstore, that's a violation of the original covenant.

Wait, but the problem is about the new lease being unenforceable. The owner is trying to enforce it.

Wait, but the owner is the one who's trying to go back and try to get that new lease. The pharmacist is suing for the new lease to be unenforceable because it's a violation of the original covenant.

So, the court would find the owner's action in favor of the pharmacist because the new lease is a violation of the original covenant.

Looking at the options, which one corresponds to that reasoning.

Option A says the covenant does not apply because the owner didn't directly lease the space but bought a new property with a lease. Hmm. No, because the original covenant was about the entire shopping center being leased to the pharmacist. The owner bought a new parcel, integrated it, and now is considering a new lease. So, the new lease is a new agreement, which could be a violation if it's a continuation or a new lease.

Option B says the owner's purchase and integration of the land nullifies the original covenant. But I don't think that's the case. The original covenant was about the specific arrangement where the owner leased the entire shopping center. The owner's new situation is about a new lease with a different drugstore, which is a different business.

Option C says the drugstore's use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and pharmacist first entered the lease. Hmm, not sure about that. The new lease is about using the adjacent land, but the original covenant was about the entire shopping center, not just the adjacent part.

Option D says the new lease is not new but a continuation. The original owner (the current owner) had a ten-year lease with the original owner (the previous owner). Now, the new owner is purchasing a new parcel and then the new owner is considering a new lease with the same drugstore. No, the new owner is now the previous owner's new tenant, so the new lease is a new agreement.

Option E says a covenant cannot restrict competition when it was created. But that's more about whether the covenant is enforceable as a restriction on the use of land, which is a broader issue. The previous owner had a ten-year lease with the current owner. The new lease is with another drugstore. So, the existing covenant is about the current owner's previous owner, not the new one.

Option F says the owner has the right to lease any part of his property regardless of existing leases. But this seems incorrect because the original covenant is a specific clause that applies only to the original owner. The new lease would be a new covenant, which is a separate matter.

Option G says the pharmacist didn't express adequate notice, but the question doesn't provide evidence of that. So, probably not the main issue.

Option H says the covenant can't restrict competition if it's in place. But that's a different issue. The problem is about whether the new lease is a violation of the original covenant, not about competition.

Option I says the covenant applies only to the original center. I think that's not correct because the new lease is with another drugstore, so it's a new covenant.

Option J says the covenant doesn't apply because the centers were separate at the time. But now, they're integrated; so that's not the case.

So, back to the original point. The new lease includes a ten-year lease with the original owner's previous owner. The original covenant was that the owner couldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the new lease is a violation because it includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore, which is a violation of the original covenant.

So, the court would find that the new lease is unenforceable because it's a violation of the original covenant. So, the correct answer is probably option A or E or something else.

Wait, option E says a covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. Hmm, but that's about the covenant being enforceable as a restriction on land use, which is different from whether it's a violation of the original agreement.

Wait, the original covenant was that the owner (the current owner) couldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. The new lease is with a different drugstore, so it's a violation.

So, looking at the options, the correct reasoning is that the new lease is a violation of the original covenant, so the court should find the owner's action.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore. Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the original covenant was about the entire shopping center, not just part of it.

Option B: The owner's purchase and integration of the land effectively nullifies the existing covenant. I don't think so; the original covenant was part of the original lease, not the new integration.

Option C: The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist first entered into the lease. Not relevant here.

Option D: The new lease is not new, but a continuation of an existing one. No, because the new lease is with a different drugstore.

Option E: A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. Hmm, not sure. The covenant was created when the original owner (the current owner) had a lease with the previous owner. The new owner is now the previous owner's tenant. So, the new lease is a new agreement. The covenant was about the previous owner's previous owner, not the new one.

Wait, no. The original covenant was that the owner (the current owner) would not lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the new lease is with a different drugstore, which is a violation of that original covenant.

So, the court would find that the new lease is unenforceable because it's a violation of the original covenant. So, the correct answer is that the court will find the owner's action because it's a violation of the original covenant.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is A? Or is it E?

Wait, option E says a covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. So, the covenant was created when the original owner had a lease with the previous owner. The new owner is now purchasing a new parcel and integrating it, but the new owner is considering a new lease with a different drugstore. So, the covenant was created, but the new lease is a new agreement, which is a separate matter.

Option A says the covenant doesn't apply to the owner's actions because he didn't directly lease the space but bought a new property with a lease. That's incorrect because the original covenant was about the specific arrangement, and the new lease is a new agreement.

So, I think the correct option is E or perhaps another. Alternatively, perhaps option A is incorrect because the covenant does apply, but the reasoning is that the new lease is a new covenant, not a violation.

Wait, the original covenant is about the entire shopping center being leased to the original owner. Now, the new owner is considering a new lease with another drugstore. So, that's a new agreement that violates the original covenant. Therefore, the court would find the owner's actions in favor of the pharmacist because the new lease is a violation.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be that the court finds the owner's action because the new lease is a violation of the original covenant. So, looking at the options, which one says that.

Looking again, option E says a covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. But that's about the covenant being enforceable as a restriction, not about whether it's a violation.

The court is looking for a violation, so the correct option should state that.

Wait, the options:

A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.

Hmm, I think this is incorrect because the original covenant was about the entire shopping center, not just part of it. So, the new lease includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore, which is a violation.

Alternatively, maybe the court considers that the new lease is a new covenant, and the original covenant was a part of the existing arrangement. So, the new lease includes the original owner's ten-year lease, which is part of the original covenant.

Wait, perhaps the court would say that the new lease is a new agreement that violates the original covenant. So, the court would find that the new lease is in fact a violation of the original covenant. So, the correct answer would be that the court finds the owner's action because the new lease is a violation.

Looking at the options, which one matches that.

Option A says the covenant doesn't apply because the owner didn't directly lease the space but bought a new property with a lease. That's incorrect because the original covenant was about the specific arrangement, and the new lease includes a different drugstore.

So, the correct option is A or E? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The original covenant was that the owner cannot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the new lease with a different drugstore is a violation because it's a different business. Therefore, the court would find the owner's action in favor of the pharmacist because the new lease violates the original covenant.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is likely option A or E.

Wait, let me re-read option E: "A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with the land." This is about whether a covenant is enforceable as a restriction on land use. It's not directly related to whether the new lease is a violation of the original covenant, but about enforceability. So, perhaps the court wouldn't find a violation of the original covenant because the covenant was created when the original owner had a lease with the previous owner. The new lease is with a different drugstore, which is a separate matter.

So, the court would look at the new lease, which is a new covenant, and find that it's a violation of the original covenant, thus finding the owner's action.

So, the correct answer is A? Or is it E? I'm not sure.

Wait, the options:

A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.

Hmm, incorrect because the original covenant was about the entire shopping center being leased to the original owner, not just part of it. So, the new lease includes that, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the court would find that the new lease is a violation of the original covenant because it's a new agreement, not an extension or a new covenant. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another point: the original covenant was that the owner wouldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the new lease is with a different drugstore, which is a violation of that original covenant.

Therefore, the court would find the owner's action because the new lease violates the original covenant.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is A, because the court would say that the covenant doesn't apply to the actions because the owner didn't directly lease the space but bought a new property with a lease. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the court would say that the new lease is a new covenant, and the original covenant was about the entire shopping center, so the new lease includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore, which is a violation.

So, I think the answer is E? No, E is about restricting competition. The question is about a violation of the original covenant, not competition.

Wait, perhaps the court would find the new lease as a violation of the original covenant because the new lease is with a different drugstore. So, the correct answer is that the court finds the owner's action because the new lease is a violation of the original covenant. The options indicate that the correct answer is A, E, etc.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.

No, that's incorrect because the original covenant was about the entire shopping center, not just part of it.

B: The owner's purchase and integration of the land nullifies the existing covenant.

No, the existing covenant was part of the original lease, not integrated.

C: The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist first entered into the lease.

No, the new lease is about the adjacent parcel, not the original owner's previous owner.

D: The new lease is not new but a continuation of an existing one.

No, the new lease is with a different drugstore, so it's a new agreement.

E: A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with the land.

Hmm, that's about whether a covenant can restrict competition. The question is about a covenant that restricts a business. So, E is about whether a covenant can be used to restrict a business, but it's not directly related to whether it's a violation of the original covenant.

So, perhaps the court would find that the new lease is a violation of the original covenant because it's a new agreement, and the original covenant was about the entire shopping center. Therefore, the court would find that the new lease is a violation of the original covenant, so the owner's action is correct.

So, which option matches that reasoning?

Looking at the options, the correct answer is not listed. Wait, no, option A is incorrect because it's about the owner not directly leasing, but the problem is about whether the new lease is a violation of the original covenant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: The original covenant was that the owner would not lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. The new lease is with a different drugstore, so it's a violation. Therefore, the court would find that the new lease is unenforceable because it's a violation of the original covenant.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is A? Or E?

Wait, perhaps the court would find that the new lease is a violation because the original covenant was about the entire shopping center. So, the new lease includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore, which is a violation. So, the court would find that the owner's action is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Wait, no, because option A is incorrect because it's about the owner not directly leasing but buying a property with a lease.

Wait, no, the correct answer is probably E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The original covenant was that the owner wouldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. The new lease is with a different drugstore. So, the new lease is a violation of the original covenant.

Therefore, the court would find that the new lease is unenforceable because it's a violation of the original covenant. So, the correct answer is the one that states that.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is A, E, or another.

Wait, perhaps the court would find that the new lease is a new covenant, which is a separate matter, and thus the court would look for whether the new covenant is a violation of the original covenant.

In that case, the court would find the owner's action correct because the new lease is a violation.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be A because it's about the owner not directly leasing, but the problem is about whether the new lease is a violation of the original covenant.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Option A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.

No, that's incorrect because the original covenant was about the entire shopping center, not part of it.

Option B: The owner's purchase and integration of the land effectively nullifies the existing covenant.

No, the existing covenant was part of the original lease, so the new integration with the new owner wouldn't nullify it.

Option C: The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist first entered into the lease.

No, the new lease is about the adjacent parcel, not the original owner's previous owner.

Option D: The new lease is not new, but a continuation of an existing one.

No, the new lease is with a different drugstore, so it's a new agreement.

Option E: A covenant that attempts to restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with the land.

This is about whether a covenant can restrict the use of land. It's not directly about whether the new lease is a violation of the original covenant.

So, the court would look for a violation, which would be option A or E.

Wait, perhaps the court would find that the new lease is a violation of the original covenant because it's a new agreement that includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore.

So, the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the court would find that the new lease is a violation of the original covenant because the original covenant was that the owner could not lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore, and now the owner is considering a new lease with a different drugstore, which is a violation.

So, the correct answer would be A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.

Wait, no, that's incorrect because the original covenant was about the entire shopping center, not part of it.

I think I'll go with option A, but I'm not confident.
</think>

The court would find the pharmacist's action in favor of the owner because the new lease with a different drugstore constitutes a violation of the original covenant. The original covenant specified that the owner could not lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore, but the new lease includes a ten-year lease with a different drugstore, which is a separate matter. The court would determine that the new lease violates the original covenant and find the owner's action correct.

ANSWER: A
