Alright, so I've got this economics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about how certain factors affect the demand curve for the Mexican peso. The options are A to G, and I need to pick which one will shift the demand curve to the left. 

Okay, let's start by recalling what the demand curve for a currency represents. The demand curve shows the relationship between the demand for a currency and the exchange rate. If the demand decreases as the exchange rate increases, the curve shifts to the left. That makes sense because higher exchange rates would mean more demand, so if demand drops when the rate goes up, the curve moves left.

Now, the question is about the demand for the mexican peso. So factors that affect a country's demand for another currency would impact the demand for the mexican peso. I remember that the demand for a foreign currency is influenced by several things. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: An increase in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles. Well, if more people want to buy Mexican products, that could mean people want to buy more mexican currency because they might need it for these goods. So that would increase the demand for the mexican currency. So that would shift the demand curve to the right, not left. So A is not the answer.

Option B: Speculation that the peso will increase in value. If people expect the mexican peso to appreciate (get stronger), they'll want to buy more of it. So that would increase demand, shifting the curve to the right. Not the one we’re looking for.

Option C: A decrease in the international demand for mexican-made textiles. If less people want to buy Mexican products, they'll need less mexican currency. So the demand for the mexican currency would decrease. That would shift the demand curve to the left. So C might be the answer, but let me check the other options.

Option D: An increase in the international demand for Mexican tourism. More people want to visit Mexico, so they might want to exchange their money for mexican currency to buy tickets or things. This would increase the demand for the mexican currency, shifting the curve right. So no, D isn't the one.

Option E: A stable rate of inflation in Mexico relative to others. If Mexico's inflation is the same as others, people might think the exchange rate won't change much, so they'll hold more of their own currency, which is mexican. So that might decrease demand for the mexican currency, shifting the curve left. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure. I think when inflation is stable, the demand for the base currency (in this case, mexican) might decrease because people expect the exchange rate to stabilize and won't need to buy more of it. So E could be a possible answer.

Option F: A lower rate of inflation in Mexico relative to others. If Mexico's inflation is lower, maybe people expect the mexican currency to strengthen because their own currency is stronger. That would make them want to buy more mexican, decreasing demand. So F would shift the curve left.

Option G: An increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to others. Higher interest rates attract foreign investors. They'll want to invest in mexican assets, which would increase the supply of mexican currency in the market. So that would decrease demand, shifting the curve left. Hmm, that's another option.

Wait, so now I'm looking for which of these options would cause a decrease in demand for the mexican currency. Let me reevaluate.

The demand for mexican currency (the foreign currency of Mexico) is affected by factors like inflation expectations, interest rates, and tourism. 

- If the inflation rate in Mexico is higher compared to others, people might hold onto more of their own currency because it's safer. So their demand for mexican would decrease, shifting the curve left. So E and F are possibilities, but only if the inflation is higher.

Wait, in option E, it's a stable rate. In F, it's lower. So if Mexico's inflation is higher, wouldn't that decrease demand? So E would be a shift left.

Similarly, if inflation is lower in Mexico, more people might want to buy mexican, leading to higher demand, so F would shift the curve right. So F would not be the correct answer.

Option G: Higher interest rates attract foreign capital, which increases demand for mexican assets, so more people want to invest in mexican, which reduces the demand for mexican currency. So G would shift the demand curve left.

So now I'm considering options C, E, F, G as possible answers.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because each of these factors affects the demand for the mexican currency differently.

Let me think again about the factors.

The demand for the mexican currency is influenced by factors that affect the demand for it. So:

- Speculation about the value: If people expect the mexican currency to increase in value, they'll buy more, increasing demand. So B would shift the curve right.

- Speculation that it will increase: C would shift it left.

- Speculation that it will decrease: Not covered in the options, but if it's expected to drop, demand decreases.

Inflation: If inflation is higher in Mexico, people hold onto their own currency. So demand for mexican would be lower, shifting left.

Interest rates: Higher rates attract foreign investors, increasing demand for mexican assets, so mexican demand goes down. So E and G would cause shifts left.

So the options that could cause a shift left are C, E, F (wait, no, F is about lower inflation, which would make demand for mex increase), G makes demand decrease.

Wait, the question is asking which of these shifts the demand curve left. So the options are from A to G.

So looking back at the options:

Options C, E, G would all cause the demand for mexican to decrease, thus shifting the curve left.

Wait, but the options are single letters, so which one is correct? The question says, which of the following will shift the demand curve... So only one correct answer.

Wait, but in the options, option C is a decrease in international demand for mex made textiles—so that would mean that less mex is bought, so demand is lower. So C would shift the demand left.

Similarly, option E is stable rate of inflation—so mex's currency’s value is expected to stay the same, so people hold more own currency, thus mex demand decreases. So E would shift the curve left.

Option G is higher interest rates, which also makes people hold more mex, so demand shifts left.

So which of these options is correct? The question is asking which of the following will shift the demand curve left. So all of C, E, G would do that.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question states that we have to pick from A to G.

Wait, but the options are from A to G, each a possible factor.

Wait, the question is which one of these will shift the demand curve left. So all of C, E, G could do that.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The demand for the mexican currency is influenced by factors like the level of inflation. So when inflation is high in Mexico, people hold onto their own currency, so demand for mex decreases—so E would cause that.

Alternatively, if mex's inflation is higher than others, people buy less mex, so demand decreases. So E.

Similarly, if the rate of inflation in Mexico is lower than others, people expect mex to appreciate, so demand for mex increases. So F would shift the curve right.

Option G: Higher interest rates attract foreign capital, which increases demand for mex, so demand decreases—so G would cause a shift left.

So the options that cause a shift left are C, E, G.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the following will shift the demand curve for the mex left. So the correct answers could be any of these.

But the options are presented as options A to G. So the choices are A to G, each a possible factor.

So the question is which of these options (A to G) would cause a left shift.

So if the question gives four options (A to D, E, F, G), then the correct answers would be C, E, G.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct option. So perhaps the question is designed to pick the most accurate.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the demand for the mexican currency. The demand for the mex would depend on how it compares to other currencies. So:

- If the mex's demand is higher, the curve is shifted right.

- If the mex's demand is lower, the curve is shifted left.

So which of the options affect the mex's demand to decrease.

Option C: decrease in international demand for mex made textiles. So less mex is bought, so mex demand goes down—so curve left.

Option E: stable rate of inflation. So mex's currency is expected to stay the same, so more people hold mex—so mex demand decreases.

Option G: higher interest rates. So more foreign investment in mex. So mex demand decreases.

So all three options C, E, G would cause the demand for mex to decrease, shifting the curve left.

But wait, the options are A to G, each being a possible answer. So the question is, which of the following is correct.

Hmm, but the question is from the options, so only one of these options is correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Let me think about each option.

Option C: decrease in the international demand for mex made textiles.

That would mean less demand for mex, so the demand for mex decreases. So C would cause the demand curve to shift left.

Option E: stable rate of inflation in Mexico.

If the mex's inflation is higher than others, people will hold less mex because it's more expensive. So E would cause the demand to decrease.

Option G: higher interest rates in Mexico.

Attractive foreign capital may cause more mex to be held by foreigners, so demand for mex would decrease.

So all three (C, E, G) would cause a left shift.

Wait, but the question's options are A to G. So the correct answers would be C, E, G.

But the way the question is worded, it's presented as multiple-choice with one correct option. So perhaps only one of these options is correct, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's effect on the demand for mex.

The demand curve for a currency is affected by factors that influence the demand for that currency. So, for the mex, the demand is influenced by:

- Expected future value: if mex's value is expected to appreciate, demand increases; if expected to depreciate, demand decreases.

- Inflation expectations: higher inflation in mex makes people hold more own currency.

- Interest rates: higher rates attract foreign capital.

- Level of economic activity: higher economic activity might lead to higher demand (like increased tourism).

So, option C: decrease in international demand for mex made textiles → less demand for mex → demand curve shifts left.

Option E: stable inflation → people hold more mex because it's expected to remain strong → demand for mex increases → demand curve shifts right.

Option G: higher interest rates → more foreign investment in mex → demand for mex decreases → demand curve shifts left.

So, options C and G cause a left shift. Option E causes a right shift.

So the correct answers would be C and G. But the question is, which of the following will shift the demand curve left. So if the options include both C and G, but the question asks for one correct answer, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options don't have both C and G as possible answers. Let me re-read the options.

Looking again, the options are:

A: increase in international demand for mex-made textiles → decrease in demand → left shift.

B: speculation about mex increasing → increase in demand → right shift.

C: decrease in international demand for mex made textiles → decrease → left shift.

D: increase in international demand for mex tourism → increase → right shift.

E: stable rate of inflation → people expect mex to stay strong → higher demand → right shift.

F: lower rate of inflation → people expect mex to appreciate → lower demand → left shift.

G: higher interest rates → more foreign investment → higher demand? Wait, no: higher interest rates attract foreign capital. So people would invest more in mex, so demand for mex would decrease.

Wait, G is about higher interest rates. So higher rates make people invest abroad, which would increase the supply of mex, so demand for mex would decrease, shifting the curve left.

So options C, G would cause the demand to shift left.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting answers. Let me think again. The correct answer is either C or G.

Wait, maybe the question is in the way it's phrased. Let me think about the demand for mex. If more people buy mex, demand increases. If fewer buy, demand decreases.

So for the demand for mex to decrease, the factors must make people want to buy less.

Option C: less mex is bought because international demand is lower. So this would cause a decrease in demand for mex.

Option G: higher interest rates attract foreign capital. So more people want to buy mex, which would increase demand, not decrease. Wait, that's opposite. So if G is higher interest rates, people invest in mex, so demand for mex increases. So G would shift the demand to the right, not left.

Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. So G would cause demand for mex to increase, which is a right shift.

So the correct options are C and F.

Wait, option F is lower rate of inflation in Mexico. If the rate of inflation is lower, people expect mex to be stronger, so they'd want to hold mex more. So the demand for mex would increase, which shifts the curve right.

So the options that cause a left shift are C and F.

Wait, but in the options given, option F is about lower inflation. So if F is correct, then it's a shift right. So only C would cause a shift left.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option G. Let me think again.

Option G says: "An increase in the interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries." So, higher interest rates attract foreign capital. That would make more people hold mex, thus increasing demand for mex. So demand curve shifts right.

So only option C would shift the demand curve left.

Wait, but earlier I thought option G would cause a shift left. Now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the issue is the interpretation of the interest rate. Generally, the interest rate affects the demand for a currency when it's seen as a foreign asset. So higher interest rates in the country attract foreign capital, which would increase the demand for that currency.

So, this would cause a right shift in the demand curve.

Hence, option G would cause demand to increase, so it's a right shift, not left.

So, the only options that cause demand to decrease are C and F.

Wait, option F is about lower inflation. If the rate of inflation is lower than others, people expect mex to appreciate. So they would buy more mex because it's stronger. Hence, demand increases, so it's a right shift.

So the only option that causes a left shift is C.

Wait, but that would mean that option C is the correct answer. Because when there's less international demand for mex, people don't want to buy it, so the demand decreases.

So I think the correct answer is C.

But wait, another thought. What about tourism demand? Option D is an increase in international tourism demand for Mexico. That would increase the demand for mex, so right shift.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find a source.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that the demand for a currency is influenced by factors like inflation expectations. If the mex's inflation is higher than others, people hold less mex.

So, the correct answer is C.

So, answering the question: which will shift the demand curve for mex to the left? The correct answer is C.
</think>

To determine which factor will shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left, we analyze each option based on its impact on the demand for the mexican currency. The demand curve shifts to the left when the quantity demanded decreases at every given exchange rate.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A: An increase in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles**  
   If more people want to buy Mexican-made textiles, the demand for mex increases, shifting the demand curve to the right. This is not correct for a left shift.

2. **Option B: Speculation that the peso will increase in value**  
   If the mex increases in value, people will buy more mex, increasing demand and shifting the curve to the right. This is not correct for a left shift.

3. **Option C: A decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles**  
   If less mex is demanded due to decreased demand for Mexican-made textiles, the demand for mex decreases, shifting the demand curve to the left. This is correct for a left shift.

4. **Option D: An increase in the international demand for Mexican tourism**  
   More people wanting to visit Mexico would increase the demand for mex, shifting the curve to the right. This is not correct for a left shift.

5. **Option E: A stable rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries**  
   If inflation is stable, people expect mex to remain strong, increasing demand for mex. This shifts the curve to the right, not left. This is not correct for a left shift.

6. **Option F: A lower rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries**  
   If inflation is lower, people expect mex to appreciate, increasing demand for mex. This shifts the curve to the right, not left. This is not correct for a left shift.

7. **Option G: An increase in the interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries**  
   Higher interest rates attract foreign capital, increasing demand for mex. This shifts the curve to the right, not left. This is not correct for a left shift.

### Conclusion:
The only factor that will shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the left is **Option C: A decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles**. This would reduce the demand for mex, causing the demand curve to shift to the left.
