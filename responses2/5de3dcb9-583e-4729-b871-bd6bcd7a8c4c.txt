Okay, so I've got this question about which test is best for a nonverbal adolescent's general cognitive abilities. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, the question is asking for a measure suitable for a nonverbal adolescent. That means it's for a child who's not yet fluent in words, so the tests should be nonverbal. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–IV. That's a big one, but it's for children aged 6-15, right? It's pretty broad, covering various areas, but I'm not sure if it's specifically for nonverbal assessments. Also, I think it's more about overall intelligence, not just specific areas like memory or IQ.

Option B: Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children–II. That rings a bell. I remember it's often used in children and adolescents, especially for intelligence and developmental purposes. It's known for assessing various cognitive skills in a nonverbal way. Maybe it's good for assessing aspects like reasoning, problem-solving, and executive functioning.

Option C: Cognitive Assessment System–II. Hmm, I'm not as familiar with this. It's a bit vague, but I think it might assess cognitive abilities in a more structured way, perhaps using tests like the Wechsler or other scales. But I'm not sure if it's the best fit for an adolescent.

Option D: Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities. That's a well-known test set. The Woodcock IV is typically used for adults, but maybe there's an adolescent version. Wait, I think the Woodcock has several levels, but the basics include the Cognitive Abilities Test (CBT-III and IV). The IV might be for a younger age, like 8-11, but if the adolescent is older, maybe it's not the best fit. Alternatively, if the adolescent is in a different age range, another version might be better.

Option E: Differential Ability Scales–II. I know DAS-2 is often used in gifted programs because it assesses both abilities and potential. It's more about identifying gifted individuals rather than general cognitive abilities. So probably not the right answer here.

Option F: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence–IV. This is specifically for children aged 3 to 15, but it's more about early childhood development and foundational skills. It's not focused on assessing general cognitive abilities in a broader sense for an adolescent.

Option G: Ravens Progressive Matrices. That's a nonverbal test used to assess problem-solving and reasoning skills, especially in a visual way. It's more about pattern recognition and understanding relationships between shapes, so it might be suitable for an adolescent who's dealing with visual-spatial challenges.

Option H: Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales–5. That's a well-known and widely used test for assessing intelligence, often used in children. It's a bit older, but it's still a solid choice. The Stanford-Binet is more about general cognitive abilities, which fits the question.

Option I: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–IV. That's for adults, so not suitable for an adolescent.

Option J: Leiter–R. I'm not sure about this one. I think the Leiter-R is another name for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, and it's for adults. So it's probably not the right choice here.

So putting it together: the question is about a nonverbal adolescent. We need a test that's nonverbal, measures cognitive abilities, and is suitable for a child around that age.

Kaufman Battery (B) is good for nonverbal assessments. It's often used for children and adolescents to check for potential delays or giftedness. It assesses various cognitive functions like memory, problem-solving, and reasoning in a visual way, which might be ideal for an adolescent.

Woodcock-Johnson IV (D) is more for adults, but perhaps an adolescent version exists. However, I'm not as confident about the age range for that.

Leiter-R (J) is for adults, so out.

Ravens (G) is good for visual reasoning, but perhaps more about pattern recognition in images.

Stanford-Binet (H) is a good general intelligence test for children, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit for this specific context.

Kaufman Battery (B) seems the best fit because it's designed for assessing cognitive abilities in a nonverbal way, and it's suitable for children. It's also designed to evaluate developmental milestones, which could be relevant for an adolescent.

Wait, another thought: Woodcock-Johnson IV (D) is the more standardized version. If the adolescent is, say, 10 years old, would the older version (IV) be better? Or perhaps the standard version (III) is better for younger children. But the question says "nonverbal adolescent," which might indicate a 10-year-old or above. However, the options don't specify age, so I have to go with the most appropriate general test.

I think the right answer is B: Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children–II.

The most appropriate measure for assessing the cognitive abilities of a nonverbal adolescent would be the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children–II (Option B). This test is specifically designed for nonverbal assessments, suitable for children aged 6-15, and evaluates various cognitive functions like memory, problem-solving, and reasoning in a visual way. It is also intended for evaluating developmental milestones, making it highly relevant for an adolescent's cognitive development.
