Okay, so I've got this group theory question about group elements and their orders. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two statements and asks whether each is true or false. Let's start with Statement 1.

Statement 1 says: If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. Hmm. I remember that the order of an element divides the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem). Also, the number of elements of a particular order relates to the structure of the group.

Wait, the number of elements of order d in a group G is related to the number of cyclic subgroups of order d. For a cyclic group of order n, the number of elements of order d is φ(d), where φ is Euler's totient function. So, for d=15, φ(15) is 8 because 15 factors into 3*5, and φ(15)= (3-1)(5-1) = 2*4=8.

So, if G has an element of order 15, then it must contain at least one cyclic subgroup of order 15. But how many elements of order 15 does that correspond to? Well, each cyclic subgroup of order 15 has φ(15)=8 elements of order 15. So, if the group has more than one cyclic subgroup of order 15, then the total number would be more than 8. But the statement says "at least 8," which would be true if there's at least one such subgroup, but wait—what if there are multiple?

Wait, but the group could have multiple subgroups of order 15. For example, if the group is abelian and has multiple cyclic subgroups of the same order, each contributing φ(15) elements. So, in that case, it's possible to have more than 8 elements of order 15.

But wait, the statement says "must have at least 8 elements." That's only necessarily true if there's at least one cyclic subgroup of order 15. So, if the group has at least one such element, then the number of elements of order 15 is at least 8 (if there's only one subgroup) or more (if there are multiple). So, Statement 1 is true because it's not possible for there to be fewer than 8 elements of order 15 in that case.

Wait, but what if the group is of a different structure? Let me think about non-cyclic groups. Oh, wait, if the group has an element of order 15, it must have a cyclic subgroup of order 15, which contains φ(15)=8 elements of order 15. So the group must have at least 8 elements of order 15, regardless of whether there are multiple subgroups. So Statement 1 is true.

Now Statement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. Hmm. So, if the group has say 16 elements of order 15, does it necessarily have at least 16? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

No, wait, the statement says that if there are more than 8 elements of order 15, then there must be at least 16. Wait, that would mean that you can't have exactly 9 elements. Because 9 is more than 8 but less than 16. So if you have 9 elements, you don't have at least 16. So the statement is false.

Wait, but let me think again. Each cyclic subgroup of order 15 contributes 8 elements. If there are two such subgroups, each contributes 8, so total elements of order 15 would be 8*2=16. So, if the group has two subgroups of order 15, then the number of elements is 16. But if it has only one subgroup, then it's 8 elements. So, the number of elements of order 15 is either 8 or a multiple of 8 (like 16, 24, etc.), depending on how many subgroups of order 15 exist.

So, Statement 2 says that if there are more than 8 elements of order 15, then you must have at least 16. But wait, if there are 9 elements, that's more than 8, but less than 16. So the statement is saying that 9 must have at least 16, which is false. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because maybe the group could have multiple subgroups but each contributes 8, so you can't have a number of elements that's not a multiple of 8 beyond 8 itself. So, for example, 8 is possible (one subgroup), 16 is possible (two subgroups), 24 is possible (three subgroups), etc. So the number of elements of order 15 can be 8, 16, 24, etc. So, if you have 9, that's more than 8 but less than 16, which would make Statement 2 incorrect because the group can have 9 elements of order 15 without having at least 16. So Statement 2 is false.

So, putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, option C is True, False (Option C: A: True, True; B: False, False; C: True, False; D: False, True). So the answer would be C.

The analysis of the two statements reveals the following:

- **Statement 1**: If a group contains an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of that order. This is true because, in a cyclic group of order 15, there are φ(15) = 8 elements of order 15. Any other structure would either have the same number or more elements of order 15, but at least 8.

- **Statement 2**: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16. This is false because the number of elements of order 15 can be 8 (for one cyclic subgroup) or a multiple of 8 (e.g., 16 for two subgroups). Having 9 elements does not meet the requirement of at least 16.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: True, False**.
