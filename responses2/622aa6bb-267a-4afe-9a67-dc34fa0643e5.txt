Okay, so I have this Fourier transform problem to solve. The function is f(t) = e^{-2t} sin(6t - 18) u(t-3). Hmm, I remember that the Fourier transform of a function multiplied by a unit step u(t - a) involves shifting the frequency domain representation. Let me think about the steps.

First, I should probably rewrite the function in a form that fits the standard Fourier transform formula they gave. The formula is F[e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t)] = [ω_0 / ( (a + jω)^2 + ω_0^2 ) ] e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is F{ e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t) } = [ω_0 / ( (a + jω)^2 + ω_0^2 ) ] e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t), but actually, that doesn't seem right because when you take the Fourier transform, the e^{-a t} part is handled in the transform.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look at the standard Fourier transform pairs. Oh right, I remember that the Fourier transform of e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t) is ω_0 / ( (a + jω)^2 + ω_0^2 ). So that's the key part.

But in this problem, the function is e^{-2t} sin(6t - 18) u(t-3). So I need to break this down into parts. Let's separate the exponential and the sinusoid, and also the unit step.

The unit step function u(t - 3) means that the function is zero for t <3, and for t >=3, it's e^{-2t} sin(6t-18). Wait, but the argument of the sine is 6t - 18, which is 6(t - 3). So that looks like a phase shift in the time domain. So sin(6(t -3)).

So, combining this, the function is e^{-2(t-3)} sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3). Because for t >=3, we have e^{-2(t-3)} and sin(6(t-3)), and the unit step ensures it's zero before that.

So, maybe I should perform a substitution to make it easier. Let me let τ = t -3. Then, when t >=3, τ >=0. So f(t) becomes e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ). So in terms of τ, the function is e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ).

Now, the Fourier transform of e^{-a τ} sin(ω_0 τ) u(τ) is ω_0 / ( (a + jω)^2 + ω_0^2 ). Wait, but let me think: the standard Fourier transform pair is F{e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t)} = (ω_0) / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω_0^2 ] multiplied by e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t). No, wait, no, the actual transform is:

The Fourier transform of e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t) (for t >=0) is [ω_0 / ( (a + jω)^2 + ω_0^2 ) ] e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t). Alternatively, more accurately, the Fourier transform F{ e^{-a t} sin(ω_0 t) u(t) } is [ ω_0 ] / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω_0^2 ) ].

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The Fourier transform of e^{-at} sin(ω t) u(t) is (ω) / ( (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ), but I might have the exponents mixed up.

Wait no, the standard transform is:

F{ e^{-at} sin(ω t) u(t) } = ω / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ].

Wait, no, perhaps the correct expression is F{ e^{-at} sin(ω t) u(t) } = ω / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ] ? Or is it the other way around?

Wait I think I'm mixing up the time domain and frequency domain. Let me clarify. The standard Fourier transform for e^{-a t} sin(ω t) u(t) is (ω) / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ].

Wait, no, perhaps the correct expression is different. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is F{ e^{-at} sin(ω t) u(t) } = ω / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ]. Let me get this right.

Another approach: using the definition of Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of f(t) is F(ω) = integral from -infty to infty of e^{-iω t} f(t) dt.

For f(t) = e^{-at} sin(ω0 t) u(t), the integral is zero for t < 0, so we integrate from 0 to infty.

So the integral becomes:

∫_{0}^{infty} e^{-at} sin(ω0 t) e^{-iω t} dt.

This can be written as:

∫_{0}^{infty} e^{-at} sin(ω0 t) e^{-iω t} dt.

Let me simplify the integrand:

e^{-at} e^{-iω t} = e^{-(a + iω) t}.

So the integral is:

∫_{0}^{infty} e^{-(a + iω) t} sin(ω0 t) dt.

Hmm, I remember that the integral of e^{-s t} sin(ω t) dt from 0 to infty is ω / (s^2 + ω^2), where s is the complex variable (s = a + iω in this case).

So substituting s = a + iω, the integral becomes ω0 / ( (a + iω)^2 + ω0^2 ). 

So yes, that's correct. So the Fourier transform of e^{-a t} sin(ω0 t) u(t) is ω0 / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω0^2 ].

Wait, but in this problem, the function is e^{-2t} sin(6t -18) u(t-3), so we can make a substitution τ = t-3, as I did earlier, so that t = τ +3, and when t >=3, τ >=0.

So f(t) = e^{-2(τ +3)} sin(6(τ +3) -18) u(τ). Let's compute that.

Simplify the exponent: e^{-2τ -6} = e^{-6} e^{-2τ}.

The argument of the sine: 6τ + 18 -18 = 6τ. So sin(6τ).

Thus, f(t) = e^{-6} e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ).

So, in terms of τ, the function is e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ), multiplied by e^{-6} and u(τ). So F transformed is e^{-6} times the Fourier transform of e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ).

So, the Fourier transform of e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ) is:

(6) / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 6^2 ].

Because a is 2, ω0 is 6.

So putting it all together, the Fourier transform of f(t) is:

e^{-6} * (6) / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ].

So the whole thing is 6 e^{-6} / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ].

Wait, let me check the options. The options given are:

A: 6e^-6 [e^-3jω / {(jω - 2)^2 + 36}]
B: 6e^-2 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 36}]
C: 3e^-6 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 36}]
D: 6e^-18 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 36}]
E: 6e^-6 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 72}]
F: 6e^-6 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 36}]
G: 3e^-2 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 18}]
H: 6e^-6 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 18}]
I: 6 [e^-3jω / {(jω + 2)^2 + 36}]

Wait, from my calculation, it's 6 e^{-6} times [6 / ( (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ) ].

So that's 6*6 e^{-6} / ( (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ), which is 36 e^{-6} / ( (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ). Wait no, wait: the denominator is (2 + jω)^2 + 36, and the numerator is 6 multiplied by 6? No, wait, the transform is 6/( (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ), so it's 6 * [6/( (2+jω)^2 +36 ) ]? No, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait no, when I substituted τ = t-3, the function became e^{-6} times e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ), so the Fourier transform is e^{-6} times the transform of e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ), which is (6) / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ].

So putting it together, the Fourier transform is e^{-6} * (6 / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ] ), which is 6 e^{-6} / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ].

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option F is 6e^-6 [e^{-3jω} / { (jω + 2)^2 +36 } ]

Wait, but my expression is 6 e^{-6} / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ].

Wait, but the options' denominator is in terms of (jω + 2)^2, which is the same as (jω +2)^2. So, (2 + jω) is same as (jω +2). So, that's correct.

So the Fourier transform is 6 e^{-6} multiplied by [ 6 / ( (2 + jω)^2 +36 ) ]? Wait no, no, no, wait: wait, the transform is 6 e^{-6} / [ (2 + jω)^2 +36 ].

Wait wait, no! Wait, in my calculation, the transform is 6/( (2 + jω)^2 +36 ), multiplied by e^{-6}.

So the entire expression is 6 e^{-6} divided by ( (2 + jω)^2 +36 ), but wait, no, the transform is 6/(denominator), and then multiplied by e^{-6}.

Wait, no. Wait, the Fourier transform is e^{-6} multiplied by [6/( (2 + jω)^2 +36 ) ].

So, the overall expression is 6 e^{-6} divided by [ (2 + jω)^2 +36 ].

Looking at the options, option F is 6e^-6 [e^{-3jω} / { (jω + 2)^2 +36 } ].

Wait, but in my calculation, the numerator is 6, not e^{-3jω}. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me reevaluate. Wait, I have f(t) = e^{-2(t-3)} sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3).

So, substituting τ = t -3, we get f(t) = e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ), multiplied by e^{-6}.

The Fourier transform of e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ) is (6) / [ (2 + jω)^2 +36 ].

So the overall transform is e^{-6} * [6/( (2 + jω)^2 +36 ) ].

Which is 6 e^{-6} / [ (2 + jω)^2 +36 ].

Wait, but option F is 6e^-6 multiplied by [ e^{-3jω} / denominator ].

Hmm, that's 6e^{-6} e^{-3jω} / denominator.

But my calculation doesn't have that; I have 6e^{-6} / denominator.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the shift in the exponential part. Because, another approach is to note that the function is e^{-2(t -3)} sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3).

Which can be expressed as e^{-2(t-3)} sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3).

So, that's e^{-2(t-3)} sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3) = e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ), where τ = t-3.

So, the function is e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ), multiplied by e^{-6}.

Wait, but wait:

Wait, the function is e^{-2(t-3)} sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3). So, substituting τ = t-3, we have e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ), multiplied by e^{-6}, because when τ = t-3, t = τ+3. So e^{-2*(τ+3)} = e^{-2τ} e^{-6}.

So that part is e^{-6} e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ).

So the Fourier transform is e^{-6} times the transform of e^{-2τ} sin(6τ) u(τ).

Now, the transform of e^{-a τ} sin(ω τ) u(τ) is ω / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ].

In our case, a is 2, ω0 is 6.

So the transform is (6) / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 6^2 ] = 6 / [ (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ].

So the overall Fourier transform is e^{-6} * [6 / ( (2 + jω)^2 +36 ) ].

So the expression is 6 e^{-6} / [ (2 + jω)^2 +36 ].

Looking at the options, option F is 6e^-6 [e^{-3jω} / { (jω + 2)^2 +36 } ].

Wait, but in my calculation, the numerator is 6, not e^{-3jω}.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should also account for the shift in the exponential in the Fourier transform. Because when you have e^{-a t} u(t) in the time domain, the Fourier transform is 1/(a + jω), but when you have e^{-a(t - t0)} sin(ω(t - t0)) u(t - t0), the Fourier transform would be e^{-a t0} * [ ω / ( (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ) ].

Wait, but in our case, the function is e^{-2(t-3)} sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3). So the exponential is e^{-2(t-3)}. So the shift is t0=3, a=2.

So the Fourier transform would be e^{-2*3} [6 / ( (2 + jω)^2 +36 ) ].

Which is e^{-6} [6 / denominator ].

So that's 6 e^{-6} / denominator.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is 6e^-6 multiplied by e^{-3jω} in the numerator.

Wait, but I don't see that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the shift.

Wait, let me think about it again. The time shift in Fourier transform: If a signal is delayed by t0, the Fourier transform is multiplied by e^{-jω t0}.

Wait, no, more accurately: F{ f(t - t0) } = e^{-jω t0} F{ f(t) }.

But in the case of e^{-a (t - t0)} sin(ω (t - t0)), the Fourier transform would be e^{-a t0} e^{-jω t0} times F{ e^{-a t} sin(ω t) u(t) }.

Wait, but wait, the formula I used earlier was for e^{-a t} sin(ω t) u(t) which gives ω / [ (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ].

So for e^{-a (t - t0)} sin(ω (t - t0)) u(t -t0), the transform is e^{-a t0} e^{-jω t0} times [ ω / ( (a + jω)^2 + ω^2 ) ].

Wait, but in our problem, the function is e^{-2(t-3)} sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3).

So a is 2, and t0 is 3.

So the Fourier transform is e^{-2*3} e^{-jω*3} times [6 / ( (2 + jω)^2 + 36 ) ].

So that's 6 e^{-6} e^{-j3ω} / ( (2 + jω)^2 +36 ).

Which can be written as 6 e^{-6} e^{-j3ω} / ( (jω + 2)^2 +36 ).

Looking at the options, option F is 6e^-6 [e^{-3jω} / { (jω +2)^2 +36} ].

So that's exactly what I have.

So the correct option is F.

Wait, but in the transformed expression, the term is e^{-j3ω}, which is the same as e^{-3jω} because j^3 = j^2 j = (-1) j = -j, so j^3 ω = (-j ω) ω = -j ω^2. Wait, no, wait: j^3 = j * j * j = j^2 * j = (-1) j = -j. So j^3 ω = -j ω. So e^{-j3ω} is e^{-j*(3ω)}, which is the same as e^{-j3ω}.

But in the options, it's written as e^{-3jω}, which is the same as e^{-j3ω} because multiplication is commutative.

Wait, actually, e^{-j3ω} is the same as e^{-j*(3ω)}, and e^{-3jω} is the same as e^{-j3ω} as well. Wait, no, no, no. Wait, no, j3ω is 3 times j times ω, while 3jω is 3 times j times ω. Oh, no, wait, j3ω is the same as 3jω because multiplication is commutative. So yes, e^{-3jω} is the same as e^{-j3ω}.

So the term in the Fourier transform is e^{-3jω}, which matches option F.

So the correct answer is option F.

Wait, but I thought my initial approach was correct, but upon reviewing, I see that the function's Fourier transform is 6e^{-6} multiplied by e^{-3jω} divided by ( (jω +2)^2 +36 ), which matches option F.

So the answer should be option F.

To determine the Fourier transform of the given function \( f(t) = e^{-2(t-3)} \sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3) \), we can break down the problem into steps:

1. **Substitution**: Let \( \tau = t - 3 \). This transforms the function into:
   \[
   f(t) = e^{-2\tau} \sin(6\tau) u(\tau)
   \]
   with \( t = \tau + 3 \).

2. **Fourier Transform of \( e^{-a\tau} \sin(\omega_0 \tau) u(\tau) \)**: The Fourier transform of \( e^{-a\tau} \sin(\omega_0 \tau) u(\tau) \) is:
   \[
   \frac{\omega_0}{(a + j\omega)^2 + \omega_0^2}
   \]

3. **Applying the Formula**: Here, \( a = 2 \), \( \omega_0 = 6 \), so the Fourier transform becomes:
   \[
   \frac{6}{(2 + j\omega)^2 + 36}
   \]

4. **Accounting for the Exponential Shift**: The function \( e^{-2(t-3)} \) introduces an exponential shift in the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of \( e^{-a(t-t_0)} f(t) \) is \( e^{-a t_0} e^{-j\omega t_0} \) times the original Fourier transform.

   Thus, the Fourier transform of \( e^{-2(t-3)} \sin(6(t-3)) u(t-3) \) is:
   \[
   e^{-6} \cdot \frac{6}{(2 + j\omega)^2 + 36} \cdot e^{-3j\omega}
   \]

5. **Simplifying the Expression**: Combining the terms, we get:
   \[
   \frac{6 e^{-6} e^{-3j\omega}}{(2 + j\omega)^2 + 36}
   \]

6. **Matching the Options**: Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option F**:
   \[
   6e^{-6} \frac{e^{-3j\omega}}{(j\omega + 2)^2 + 36}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: F**
