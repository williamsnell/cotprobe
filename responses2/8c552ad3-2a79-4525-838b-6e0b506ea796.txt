Okay, so I've got this insurance policy question to tackle. Let me read it again carefully. The policy was bought on March 10th with a $155 premium. Then, on September 6th, the owner of the car canceled the policy. I need to find out how much the refund would be.

Hmm. I remember that insurance policies often have terms about how long they're valid. Usually, they're valid for a certain period. But wait, sometimes policies have a term of validity. I'm not entirely sure, but I think they're usually for a few years, like 3 years. So, if the policy was purchased on March 10, then it would be valid for, say, 3 years from that date. Let me check that. March 10 to September 6 is about 7 months, which is less than a year. So, maybe the policy is valid for 3 years. That would make it valid until March 10 of the fourth year.

Wait, but what determines the refund when the policy is canceled? Oh right, there are two common types: a refund and a refund plus interest. I think the refund is usually calculated based on the time the policy was in effect. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method. Let me think. The policy was purchased on March 10, and it's canceled on September 6. So, how many months is that? Let's count. March 10 to March 31 is 21 days. April has 30 days, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 6. Let me add those up. 21 (March) +30 (April)=51, +31 (May)=82, +30 (June)=112, +31 (July)=143, +31 (August)=174, +5 (September 6th)=179 days. So that's about 6 months. But wait, maybe it's 6 months and a few days. But for the purposes of calculating the refund, the exact number of days isn't the main factor—perhaps the number of months.

Now, the policy had a $155 premium. If it's valid for 3 years, then the refund would be the full premium. But wait, sometimes the refund is prorated based on the time the policy was in effect. But I think if the policy is valid for the entire term, the refund is just the premium. So if the policy is valid for 3 years, and it was canceled on September 6, which is within the 3-year period, the refund would be $155. Wait, but let me think again—if the policy was valid for 3 years, then the entire 3 years would give a refund of $155. So the answer would be B: $155.

Alternatively, another way to think is that if the policy is canceled, the refund is typically the amount of premium paid, because the policy is canceled, and you're losing the coverage. But I'm not entirely sure if there's an interest involved. Wait, sometimes policies have an option for a refund plus interest. So, if you cancel a policy, you might get the premium back plus some interest. But I'm not certain about that. Let me think about the standard terms. 

In general, the refund for a policy canceled within its validity period is just the premium, as the policy is void. So, if the policy was held for 3 years, and you cancel it on time, you get the full $155 back. So the answer would be B. But wait, let me think again. The policy was purchased on March 10, and it's canceled on September 6, which is within the 3-year term. So the refund is $155. So the correct answer is B.
