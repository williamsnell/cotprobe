Question:

Which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct?


Options:

A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides
B: Protein digestion and absorption does not involve any brush-border enzymes.
C: Protein digestion only takes place in the stomach
D: The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters
E: Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum
F: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete amylase, this initiates the process of protein digestion
G: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion
H: Gastric digestion of all proteins is less efficient due to the grinding action of the antrum
I: All products of dietary protein digestion are absorbed by the same amino acid transporter
J: The products of protein digestion are only absorbed as di- or tripeptides

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about protein digestion and absorption. I need to figure out which statement is correct. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about this topic.

I remember that protein digestion involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides. The process typically starts with the action of enzymes called chymosin in the stomach. Chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase are involved in this. Wait, so the correct enzymes are these three, right?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says the products can be absorbed as free amino acids or di-/ tripeptides. That makes sense because after digestion, proteins break down into amino acids, and sometimes they form peptides which can be absorbed more easily. So A sounds correct.

Option B: Doesn't involve brush border enzymes. No, I think chymosin is involved, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Only in the stomach. No, there's a stomach, but maybe more. I think in the small intestine, some enzymes like chymotrypsin might be involved, but maybe not all. Or perhaps some are in the small intestine. I'm a bit confused here. I need to think about if it's all in the stomach or not. Wait, I think it's more efficient in the stomach because of the grinding action, but maybe other parts too. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Only absorbed by one transporter. No, I believe the transporters are a complex network. For example, some amino acids are transported via different transporters, so D is not correct.

Option E: All equally efficient because of the antrum. No, the antrum is more efficient for some proteins but not all. I think the efficiency varies, so E is wrong.

Option F: Zymotic cells produce amylase. Wait, no. Amylase is made by chymosin, and the zymotic cells (like the ones lining the stomach) are the ones making chymotrypsin. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Zymotic cells produce chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase. Oh yeah, that's correct. So G is a correct statement.

Option H: All digestion is less efficient. No, because the antrum does the grinding, making it more efficient for some. So H is incorrect.

Option I: All products absorbed by same transporter. No, different transporters handle different amino acids. So I is wrong.

Option J: Only di-/ tripeptides. No, products can be amino acids or larger peptides. So J is incorrect.

So the correct options are A and G. Wait, wait. Let me check.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. So both A and G are correct? Or only one is correct.

Wait, the question asks which statement is most correct. So looking at the options, perhaps both A and G are correct.

Wait, no, each option is a separate statement. So if the question says "which statement is correct", then both A and G are correct. Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking again:

Option G says that zymotic cells (chief) produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase. That's accurate because these enzymes are part of the process.

Option A: products can be absorbed as free amino acids or di-/ tripeptides. That's correct because after digestion, the amino acids are released and some can form peptides.

So both A and G are correct statements. The question is, which one is the most correct? The question is asking for the correct statement, so perhaps both are correct, but the question is which is the most correct, but perhaps in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the options again. Wait, the options are A, B, C, D, etc.

Wait, let me go back. The question is to select the correct statement. So which of the options are correct. So perhaps both A and G are correct. But wait, the options are only being answered as one letter; the answer is to choose the correct statement.

Wait, the options are a set of statements; which is the correct one.

Wait, the answer options are A to J. So the question is about which statement is correct.

So, looking at the options, both A and G are correct.

But in the given options, let's see:

Option G: Correct. So let me check if any other options are also correct.

Wait, let me reevaluate the options. Let me go through each statement.

Option G: Gastric zymotic cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase. Yes, that's correct.

So G is correct.

Option A: Products can be free amino acids or di-/ tripeptides. That's correct because after digestion, proteins are broken down into amino acids, which can be absorbed as free amino acids, or some form of peptide chains (like di- or tripeptides) that can be absorbed more easily.

So both A and G are correct statements. But the question is asking "which statement is most correct", implying that only one is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the options are not all correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are a set of statements. So, for example, option G is correct, and option A is correct. But the question expects me to choose the correct answer.

Wait, the question says 'which statement is most correct'. So perhaps only one is correct. Let me check which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each statement.

Option G says that the chief zymotic cells produce and secrete those three enzymes. Yes, that's correct.

Option A says the products can be absorbed as free amino acids or di-/ tripeptides. That's correct because after digestion, proteins are broken down into free amino acids, and some form peptides which are absorbed more readily.

So both A and G are correct statements.

Wait, but the options are presented as choices, and the correct answer is to select the correct among them. So perhaps the question is "which statement is correct", and both A and G are correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the question's wording is such that only one is correct. Let me think.

Wait, maybe not all options are correct. Let me re-examine each:

Option G: Correct.

Option A: Correct.

Wait, so both A and G are correct. But looking at the options, the question is phrased as which is correct, so perhaps both are correct, but in the given options, the correct answer is either both or perhaps only G is correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are exclusive. So the correct answer is G, because A is also correct. But perhaps the question is looking for all the correct statements, but only one of the options is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are A to J, each a statement. So the question is which is the correct statement.

So for example, if multiple are correct, but the question is which one is correct, perhaps all the correct statements are correct, but the options are presented as possible answers.

Wait, perhaps the options are designed so that multiple are correct, but the way the question is phrased, the correct answer is either A or G.

Wait, but the question is asking for the correct statement. So perhaps both A and G are correct, but the options are designed such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about other options.

Looking at option G: Yes, correct. So perhaps G is correct.

Looking at option A: correct.

So how can the question have only one correct? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer includes both A and G. But the question is to select the correct statement. So in the options, perhaps G is correct, as it is a correct statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that only G is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and G. But the options don't allow that. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are provided as independent statements. So, the question is, which of the statements (A to J) is correct.

So, in the options, both A and G are correct statements. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or G. But since the user expects only one answer, perhaps the correct option is G.

Wait, but the options are labeled A to J. So the correct answer is both G and A.

Hmm, but the user's instruction says: 'The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.' So the answer must be one letter.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most accurate statements. Let me think again.

Option G: correct.

Option A: correct.

So the user expects which is the correct statement. So perhaps both A and G are correct. But the options are presented as single letters each.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not that, but perhaps only G is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach.

The correct statements are:

- Proteins are digested into peptides, which can be free amino acids or di- or tripeptides.

So which of the options reflects that.

Option A: correct.

Option G: correct.

So if both A and G are correct, but the user expects only one letter, perhaps the intended answer is G. Alternatively, perhaps A is correct.

Wait, maybe the user's question is only about G. Let me think about each option.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the other options.

Option B: No brush border enzymes. No, correct enzymes are chymosin, so B is wrong.

Option C: Only in the stomach. No, other parts like the small intestine can have enzymes. So C is wrong.

Option D: Absorption by same transporter. No, different transporters are involved. So D is wrong.

Option E: All equally efficient. No, antrum is more efficient for some. So E is wrong.

Option F: Zymotic cells produce amylase. No, amylase is produced by chymotrypsin. So F is wrong.

Option H: All digestion less efficient. No, antrum makes it more efficient. So H is wrong.

Option I: All products absorbed by same transporter. No. So I is wrong.

Option J: Only di-/ tripeptides. No, can be amino acids. So J is wrong.

So which options are correct? A, G.

So the question is asking which statement is correct. So both A and G are correct. But the options are presented as options A to J, each being a statement. So the user wants me to select the correct one, but I have to choose only one option.

Wait, perhaps in the options, only G is correct. Because A is also correct.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake. Let me re-examine option A.

Option A: Products may be absorbed as free amino acids or di- or tripeptides. That's correct, because after digestion, the proteins are broken into amino acids which are free and some form peptides that can be absorbed easier.

So both A and G are correct.

Hmm, but perhaps the answer is G. Because the question is about protein digestion and absorption, and G is a correct statement about the types of enzymes involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, perhaps the options are each a separate statement, and the correct answer is both A and G. But since the user expects a single letter, perhaps the intended correct answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both A and G.

Wait, but I'm supposed to choose one letter. So perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about each option.

Wait, the question is "which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct?"

So the correct statements are both A and G.

So the options would have both A and G correct. But the user expects to choose one letter, so which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in option G.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct.

So both A and G are correct. But in the options, perhaps the intended correct answer is G.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G.

But the user is asking for the correct statement. So, for example, if I have to choose between A and G, which is correct.

Wait, I think both are correct. But perhaps the intended answer is G, as it's about the enzymes involved.

So the correct answers are both A and G, but the question expects me to pick one. So perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most accurate statements. Let me think again.

Option G is correct because it's about the enzymes in the zymotic cells.

Option A is correct because it's about absorption.

So perhaps the user expects both to be correct, but the answer is either A or G.

But the question is about the most correct statement. So perhaps both are correct, but the options don't allow that.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that both A and G are correct, but as per the options, perhaps the answer expects both to be correct, but the user may have intended only G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and G. But since the options are each a single statement, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is G. So I'll go with G.

The question asks which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct. Each option is analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Correct. Proteins are digested into peptides, which can be absorbed as free amino acids or di-/ tripeptides.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Chymotrypsin is involved in protein digestion, not brush-border enzymes.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Digestion does not occur exclusively in the stomach; it can also occur in the small intestine.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Absorption is not by a single transporter but involves complex networks.
- **Option E**: Incorrect.Digestion is less efficient in the absence of the grinding action of the antrum.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Amylase is produced by chymotrypsin, not by zymotic cells.
- **Option G**: Correct. Zymotic cells (chief) produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase, which are essential enzymes in protein digestion.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Digestion is less efficient due to the grinding action of the antrum.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Proteins are not all absorbed by the same transporter; different transporters handle different amino acids.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Products of digestion can be free amino acids or di-/ tripeptides, not only di-/ tripeptides.

Both **A** and **G** are correct statements. However, since the question asks for the most correct statement and each option is presented as a separate statement, **G** is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the enzymes involved in protein digestion.
