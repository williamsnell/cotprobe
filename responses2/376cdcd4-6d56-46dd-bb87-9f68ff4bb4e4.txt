Okay, so I have this question about inventory methods and how changes in methods affect ending inventory and income tax. Let me try to think this through.

The question says that mast Co. switched from FIFO to LIFO. They're asking what happens to ending inventory and income tax payable when there's inflation. Hmm. I remember that FIFO and LIFO are different inventory valuation methods. Under FIFO, the cost of goods sold is based on the cost of the oldest inventory items, while LIFO uses the most recent. 

Wait, but what's the impact of using FIFO versus LIFO on ending inventory? I think when using FIFO, older, cheaper inventory is sold first, so the ending inventory would be more expensive. Or wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think again. FIFO would report lower ending inventory because the older, cheaper items are sold first, leaving more expensive items to be in the ending inventory. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in inflation, the prices are going up. So, if you use FIFO, you're selling the lower-priced items first, which would mean more of the older, cheaper inventory is sold. So, the ending inventory would consist of more recent, higher-priced items. So, under FIFO, the ending inventory would be lower, because the cost of goods sold (COGS) would be based on lower prices. Whereas under LIFO, since you're selling the more recent, higher-priced items first, the COGS would be higher, leading to higher ending inventory.

Wait, but for the question, it's about the effect on ending inventory and tax. So, if mast used FIFO, then during inflation, they sold lower-priced items first, so the ending inventory is more of the higher-priced, more expensive stuff. So ending inventory would be higher if using FIFO, lower with LIFO? Or wait, maybe not. Because if it's FIFO, the older, lower prices are sold first, so the remaining inventory would be higher-priced. So, ending inventory would be higher when using FIFO? Wait no, when using FIFO, the cost of goods sold is lower because they're selling cheaper items first, so ending inventory is higher. Or wait, maybe I got it backwards.

Wait, perhaps I should think of a simple example. Let's say you have two products, Product A and B. Product A was bought at $10, Product B at $20. If you sell Product A first, FIFO would have COGS as $10, leaving $20 in ending inventory. So, under FIFO, you have more higher-priced items in ending inventory. Under LIFO, you sell Product B first, so COGS is $20, leaving $10 in ending inventory. So, under FIFO, ending inventory is higher than under LIFO because more high-priced items are there.

Wait, but the question is about inflation. So prices are going up, so the FIFO method would result in lower ending inventory because you sell the lower-priced items first. Let me correct that. So, if the prices are higher, and FIFO is used, then the older items are cheaper. So you sell more of the lower-priced items, which are sold at lower prices, leading to lower COGS. So, ending inventory would be higher because more of the newer, higher-priced items are left.

Under LIFO, you sell the higher-priced items first. So, during inflation, you sell the more expensive items first. That means COGS is higher, leading to higher ending inventory. So, with LIFO, ending inventory is higher than FIFO. Because in FIFO, you have more high-priced items in ending inventory, while in LIFO, you have fewer but higher-priced items.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Let's say the company has two products: Product X at $10 and Product Y at $20. They sell 100 units of X and 100 of Y. 

FIFO: Sell X first. So COGS is 100*$10 = $1000. Ending inventory is 100*$20 = $2000.
LIFO: Sell Y first. COGS is 100*$20 = $2000. Ending inventory is 100*$10 = $1000.

So, under FIFO, ending inventory is higher, and under LIFO, ending inventory is lower.

Now, how does this affect tax? Because the taxable income is different. COGS affects the income statement. For FIFO, COGS is lower, so taxable income is lower. For LIFO, COGS is higher, so taxable income is higher.

Taxation depends on the tax rate. But in inflation, the higher prices mean that the difference between FIFO and LIFO is more pronounced. Also, when you use LIFO, you have to pay taxes on higher COGS, which means higher taxable income, so higher tax expense.

So, the question is: when using LIFO during inflation, what's the impact on ending inventory and income tax payable compared to FIFO?

Starting with ending inventory: Under FIFO, ending inventory is higher; under LIFO, it's lower. So, if mast used LIFO, their ending inventory would be lower. So, in the case of switching from FIFO to LIFO, if they were using FIFO before, now they're using LIFO. So, their ending inventory would be lower than if they had used FIFO. Wait, no. Because they switched from FIFO to LIFO. So, before the switch, if they used FIFO, ending inventory was higher. After the switch, using LIFO, ending would be lower. So, ending inventory would be lower. So, if they switched from FIFO to LIFO, ending inventory would be lower.

Wait, no, the question is about the effect of using LIFO after switching from FIFO. So, if they were using FIFO before, and now switch to LIFO, ending inventory would be lower because LIFO leads to lower ending inventory (in this example, lower than FIFO). So, their ending inventory would be lower now, not higher.

Wait, but the question is, when mast switched from FIFO to LIFO, what is the effect on ending inventory and income tax.

So, after the switch, using LIFO, the ending inventory is lower than FIFO. So, their ending inventory is lower than before. Because they switched to LIFO, which leads to lower ending inventory.

Now, about the income tax. COGS is lower in FIFO, so taxable income is lower. So, lower taxable income leads to lower income tax. But with LIFO, COGS is higher, so taxable income is higher. So, higher taxes.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on both ending inventory and tax. So, in the question, mast has switched from FIFO to LIFO, and is considering this during inflation. So, when using LIFO, the ending inventory is lower than if they had used FIFO. And because COGS is higher, the taxable income is higher, so the income tax payable is higher.

So, if mast used FIFO, their ending inventory is higher. If they use LIFO, ending inventory is lower. So, the ending inventory is lower when using LIFO during inflation.

As for income tax, COGS is higher under LIFO, leading to higher taxable income, so higher income tax. So, using LIFO during inflation when prices are going up, mast's ending inventory is lower and income tax is higher.

Looking at the options, the question is asking: ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO would be higher or lower than FIFO?

Wait, no. Wait, the options are about the change compared to FIFO. So, when mast switched from FIFO to LIFO, which would be the case during inflation. So, their ending inventory would be lower (because LIFO leads to lower ending inventory when prices are going up), and income tax would be higher because COGS is higher.

But the options are about the effect of LIFO compared to FIFO. So, if they switch from FIFO to LIFO, using LIFO, their ending inventory is lower than FIFO, and their tax is higher than FIFO.

Wait, but the question is phrased: "using LIFO would ending inventory and income tax payable be higher or lower than FIFO?"

Wait, no, the question says: "during a period of inflation," so mast's inventory method switched from FIFO to LIFO. So, when they do this, ending inventory and tax would be compared to FIFO.

Wait, I think I got the question wrong before. Let me read it again.

The question is: mast Co. switched from FIFO to LIFO. During inflation, what happens to ending inventory and income tax? The options are whether they are same, higher, lower, etc.

Wait, the question is, when mast switched from FIFO to LIFO, during inflation, what is the effect on ending inventory and tax.

So, before the switch, they were using FIFO. After the switch, they're using LIFO.

So, during inflation, the impact on ending inventory is: LIFO leads to lower ending inventory (because more high-priced items are left), so ending inventory is lower than FIFO.

As for tax, COGS is higher under LIFO, so higher taxable income, leading to higher tax. So, using LIFO during inflation would result in lower ending inventory and higher income tax.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "ending inventory and income tax payable using LIFO be higher or lower than FIFO."

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Because after the switch, they are using LIFO, which would mean lower ending inventory and higher tax. So, compared to FIFO, their ending inventory is lower, and tax is higher.

But the question is phrased as, "using LIFO would ending inventory and income tax payable be higher or lower than FIFO?" So, the question is: when they switch to LIFO during inflation, their ending inventory is lower than FIFO, and their tax is higher than FIFO. So, the effect is: ending inventory is lower, tax is higher.

Looking at the options, option G says "Lower Higher." Wait, the options are:

Options:

A: Same Higher

B: Same Lower

C: Lower Higher

D: Lower Lower

E: Same Same

F: Higher Higher

G: Lower Same

H: Higher Same

I: Higher Lower

J: No change in either ending inventory or income tax payable.

Wait, so the correct answer should be: ending inventory is lower, and tax is higher. So, lower for inventory, higher for tax. So option G says "Lower Higher." So, the answer would be G.

But wait, I thought when you switch from FIFO to LIFO, the ending inventory is lower because you're holding more of the higher-priced items. So, using LIFO gives lower ending inventory. And higher taxes because COGS is higher.

Yes, so G is correct.
</think>

When mast Co. switched from FIFO to LIFO during a period of inflation, the following occurs:

1. **Ending Inventory**: Under FIFO, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is based on the older, cheaper inventory items, leaving more expensive, recently purchased inventory to be in ending inventory. During inflation, this results in a higher ending inventory because the higher-priced items are retained. Conversely, under LIFO, the newer, more expensive inventory is sold first, leading to a lower ending inventory. Thus, using LIFO results in **lower ending inventory** compared to FIFO.

2. **Income Tax Payable**: COGS is a critical component of taxable income. Under FIFO, COGS is lower because the cost of goods sold is based on older, cheaper inventory. This reduces taxable income, leading to lower income tax payable. Under LIFO, COGS is higher because the cost of goods sold is based on newer, more expensive inventory. This increases taxable income and, consequently, higher income tax payable. Therefore, using LIFO during inflation results in **higher income tax payable** compared to FIFO.

Combining these effects, using LIFO during inflation leads to **lower ending inventory** and **higher income tax payable** compared to FIFO.
