Okay, I need to figure out the right answer to this question about how Rogers explains Peter's parents' attitude. Let me think through it step by step.

So, the scenario is that Peter is deciding to become an artist, despite his parents claiming he's a good doctor. They feel upset about his choice. The question is about Rogers' theory, which I remember relates to the Five Sages and the five Ms: Motivation, Magnitude, Medium, Medium, Message. Wait, no, wait. I think Rogers's theory is about how people respond to certain messages. The five Ms are Motivation, Magnitude, Medium, Medium, and Message.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me recall: Rogers' five Ms theory is about the five elements that people need to fulfill their needs. The five Ms are: Magnitude (what they need), Motivation (why they need it), Medium (how they access it), Medium (how they experience it), and Message (the way they are communicated).

But wait, in the context of the question, it's about how the parents' attitude is explained. The question is about why the parents feel upset, so perhaps it's about their own needs and how they are being communicated.

Looking at the options, the question is about how Rogers would explain the parents' attitude. So, the parents have a strong love for their son, but Peter's decision is against their values.

Rogers might explain it as a conflict between the parents' desire to maintain their family's traditions and Peter's decision to follow a different path, which is more in line with their values.

Looking at the options, let me read them again.

Option B: Peter's parents' attitude can be explained by the threat to their self-structure, which contains the notion that to be of value, a male family member must be a doctor. This idea is incongruent with their love for their son, causing distress.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, Rogers might argue that their son's parents think that the only way to be valuable is by being a doctor, which they believe is a traditional value. So, if Peter chooses an alternative, it's a threat to their self-structure and doesn't align with their love for their son, leading to distress.

Alternatively, option A says Peter's parents wanted him to continue the family legacy. That could be another way to frame it, but the question is about Rogers's explanation.

Option D says they are afraid Peter is not talented enough. That might be more about a lack of self-efficacy, but Rogers' theory focuses more on the message they are sending.

Option B seems to fit. The parents think their son's value is tied to being a doctor, which is a traditional expectation. If Peter chooses to be an artist, it's a deviation from that expectation, leading to dissatisfaction.

Another option is option F, which is about social stigma. But Rogers would likely explain it more in terms of their values, not just social stigmatizing.

So, the best fit seems to be B. The parents think the only way to be valuable is to be a doctor (their belief), and Peter's choice of art is a threat to that, causing distress.

The correct answer is B. Peter's parents' attitude can be explained by their belief that their son's value is tied to being a doctor, a traditional expectation, and their fear that Peter's choice of art, a different tradition, contradicts this.

Answer: B
