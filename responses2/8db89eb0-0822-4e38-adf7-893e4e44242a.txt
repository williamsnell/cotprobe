Okay, so I need to figure out the value of this investment. Let me read the question again. The investment generates income that grows at 5% per annum, and the current market discount rate is 15%. The next payout is $10. I'm supposed to find the investment's value. Hmm, I think this is about calculating the present value of a growing perpetuity.

Wait, what's a growing perpetuity again? Oh right, it's a cash flow that grows at a constant rate each period, and it goes on forever. The formula for the present value of a growing perpetuity is PV = C1 / (r - g), where C1 is the first cash flow, r is the discount rate, and g is the growth rate. 

So in this case, the first payout is $10, so C1 is 10. The growth rate g is 5%, which is 0.05. The discount rate r is 15%, so 0.15. Plugging these into the formula: 10 / (0.15 - 0.05) = 10 / 0.10 = 100. 

Wait, that gives me $100, which is option I. Let me cross-check. So the next payment is 10, and each subsequent payment is 5% higher. The discount rate is higher than the growth rate, so the present value exists and is finite. So I think option I is the right answer.

The correct answer is the present value of the growing perpetuity. Using the formula \( PV = \frac{C_1}{r - g} \), where \( C_1 = 10 \), \( r = 0.15 \), and \( g = 0.05 \), we calculate \( PV = \frac{10}{0.15 - 0.05} = \frac{10}{0.10} = 100 \).

Answer:
I: $100
