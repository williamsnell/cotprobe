Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these games isn't played with cards. The options given are A to I, with each being a different game. Let me go through each one step by step.

Option A: Euchre. I remember hearing that Euchre is played with cards. It's a card game, so that's one that uses cards.

Option B: Craps. Definitely a card-based game. People usually use dice and cards in craps, so it's definitely cards.

Option C: Bridge. Oh, bridge! That's definitely a game that uses cards. People use a deck of cards to play bridge.

Option D: Solitaire. Solitaire doesn't use cards. It's a card-free game. You just have a set of cards and a playing surface, right? So solitaire isn't a card game.

Option E: Poker. That's another card game. People use jacks, queens, kings, and cards to determine the winner.

Option F: Blackjack. Definitely a card game. Players use cards and a dealer's face-up card to reach a certain sum without going over.

Option G: Hearts. Oh, Hearts! That's a card game too. People use a deck of cards and play through the game.

Option H: Baccarat. That's a card game as well. Players draw cards from a shoe and compete against each other.

Option I: Rummy. Rummy is a card game. It involves drawing cards and using them according to specific rules.

So, looking back, the question asks which game is NOT played with cards. Solitaire (Option D) is the only one that doesn't use cards. The others all involve playing cards in some way, except solitaire.
