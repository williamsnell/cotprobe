Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about moral obligations, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says: "Mill claims that the distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds perfectly to the distinction between:"

Then there are options from A to J. I'm supposed to pick the correct one, and the answer has to be the letter I choose, with the last character being the letter I picked.

Hmm, I remember that moral obligations and duties often relate to concepts like duty, oaths, or the different types of legal obligations. I think Mill's views might be connected to his concept of duties as duties, or maybe to the distinction between absolute and relative obligations.

Wait, the question is about the difference between justice and other moral obligations. So Mill is making a claim about how justice fits into a broader moral framework. I think Mill might have discussed the difference between duties and obligations, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact points.

I recall that Mill's concept often distinguishes between absolute and relative duties. Absolute duties are those that must be fulfilled regardless of one's personal circumstances, like serving the public interest. Relative duties, on the other hand, are based on one's personal capacity. So, justice might be considered a relative duty because it's about one's own actions and abilities.

Looking at the options, option D is "absolute and relative obligations." That might be the right answer. But wait, the question is about justice and other moral obligations. So, does justice fall under absolute or relative? I think justice is more about duties owed to others in general, which could be seen as a general obligation, or absolute, but not sure. Alternatively, it might not be absolute, so it's relative.

But wait, another angle: Mill's concept of duties. He distinguishes between duties (which are owed to others) and obligations (which are owed to oneself). So, justice is an obligation, but it's a duty rather than an obligation. So perhaps the distinction Mill is making is between duties (which are owed to others) and obligations (which are owed to oneself), which would correspond to absolute and relative duties.

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again. The question is about justice specifically. So, according to Mill, justice as a moral obligation might align with relative duties because it's about one's own actions and abilities. So, justice is a relative moral obligation, perhaps.

Alternatively, I think the key is that Mill's distinction is between duties and obligations, which are absolute and relative. So, for example, if someone has a duty to help others, it's an absolute duty, but if someone has an obligation to keep a promise, it's a relative one.

But the question is about justice, which is a moral obligation. I'm a bit confused. Wait, I remember reading that Mill argued that justice is a duty that is relative because it's owed to others, not to oneself. So the distinction between justice and other moral obligations (which are duties owed to others) would be the same as the distinction between absolute and relative duties.

Wait, the options are:

A: strong and weak duties.

B: personal and public duties.

C: conscious and unconscious.

D: absolute and relative.

E: positive and negative.

F: moral and ethical.

G: direct and indirect.

H: legal and illegal.

I: perfect and imperfect.

J: urgent and non-urgent.

So, if justice is a relative moral obligation, then the answer would be D: absolute and relative. Because Mill might have said that moral duties can be absolute (like paying taxes) or relative (like owing a debt). So justice as a moral obligation would be a relative one.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing up the concepts. Let me think of another approach. The question says "the distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds perfectly to the distinction between". So, if justice is a type of moral obligation, and other obligations are duties (like duties owed to others or personal ones), then the difference between justice and others would be the same as the difference between absolute and relative duties.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is D: absolute and relative. Because justice is a relative moral obligation, and others would be absolute (like duties owed to others). So the distinction is between absolute and relative duties.

The correct answer is D: absolute and relative obligations.

**Explanation:**
Mill argued that moral obligations can be categorized into absolute and relative duties. Absolute duties are duties owed to others, such as paying taxes, while relative duties are based on one's personal abilities, like owing a debt. Justice, as a moral obligation, is a relative duty because it is owed to others, not to oneself. Therefore, the distinction between justice and other moral obligations aligns with the distinction between absolute and relative obligations.
