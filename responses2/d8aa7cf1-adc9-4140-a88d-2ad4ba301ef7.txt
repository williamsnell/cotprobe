Question:

A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial artists' studios in that city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial figure drawer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the drawer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of an artist's studio in the city. A gallery, located in a neighboring state, has been sending two itinerant artists into the city. Their practice is to draw a picture of a pedestrian, ask him to order a finished painting, and collect a payment of $2. 00. The drawing is sent to a studio, which frames it and mails the framed painting to the customer. The neighboring state does not impose a tax on artists' studios. The gallery challenges the constitutionality of the $100 per year excise tax that is imposed upon its itinerant artists in the city. The court will most likely declare this tax

Options:

A: constitutional, as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce.
B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.
C: constitutional, as it is a valid usage fee for public property.
D: constitutional, as the tax is a valid exercise of the city's power to regulate commerce.
E: unconstitutional, as it violates the principle of equal protection under the law.
F: constitutional, since the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures.
G: unconstitutional, since the tax unfairly burdens out-of-state businesses.
H: unconstitutional, since a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be perfonned in another state.
I: unconstitutional, since it amounts to double taxation.

Okay, so I've got this question about excise taxes and their constitutionality. Let me try to break it down. 

The question describes a city imposing two types of excise taxes. The first is a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial artists' studios. The second is a $100 tax per year on itinerant commercial figure drawers. But here's the catch: there's a credit allowed against the latter tax if the drawer or their employer pays the city for the maintenance of the artist's studio. 

Now, the gallery is bringing up this tax as unconstitutional. They claim the $100 tax is discriminatory because it's applied to itinerant artists from neighboring states, not to local commercial artists. 

I remember that excise taxes are taxes on the use or enjoyment of goods, services, or other property. They are typically valid as long as they're applied consistently and don't disproportionately affect certain groups. 

In this case, the $100 tax is a credit against the city's taxes. So it's like a usage fee. The requirement is that the city must collect the full amount to be eligible for the credit. 

The issue here is whether this credit is fair. The city is allowing it because it's a valid use fee for public property. The key point is that the tax is levied on the activity (itinerant artists) but the credit is given based on the amount collected. 

The gallery is arguing that this is a privilege tax, which is unfair because it's applied to people outside their state. However, privilege taxes are sometimes considered discriminatory if they disproportionately affect certain groups. 

Wait, but this is an excise tax, not a privilege tax. Excise taxes are on specific goods or services. In this scenario, the tax is on the activity of drawing pictures, which is a service provided by commercial artists. The city is considering it as an expense, so it's a usage fee. 

I think the Supreme Court has held that usage fees are valid if they're applied equitably. The idea is that the tax should not disproportionately burden certain groups. The limitation is that the city has to collect the full amount to get the credit. 

So the tax is constitutional because it's a valid use fee for public property. The credit ensures that the city can use the funds to pay for the artists' studios. The gallery's concern about out-of-state businesses might be a red herring because this tax is specifically on local activity. 

Looking at the options: option C says it's constitutional as a valid usage fee. Option A says it's constitutional as a valid ad valorem tax. Hmm. Wait, usage fee is a specific term for a tax on the use or enjoyment of goods, services, etc. Ad valorem taxes are based on value. So this isn't an ad valorem tax, it's a usage fee. 

Wait, the tax is on the activity (itinerant artists) but the amount is a credit. So it's a usage fee. The key is whether it's a valid tax under the constitutional framework. 

The Supreme Court has held that usage fees are constitutional as they're applied equitably and don't cause discrimination. So the court would likely say the tax is constitutional. 

Let me think about the options again. Option C says it's constitutional because it's a valid usage fee. Option A is about ad valorem, which is a different type. So the correct answer is probably C. 

Wait, but what about option F? It says the tax is constitutional because it's applied not to the whole business but to local activity. That's part of why it's valid. So yes, that makes sense. 

Alternatively, option E says it's unconstitutional because it violates equal protection. But the issue here is that the tax is on the activity of artists from another state. But since the city is covering it as a local activity, it's not discriminatory. 

So the court would likely say the tax is constitutional, option C. But wait, what about option G? It says it's unconstitutional because it unfairly burdens out-of-state businesses. No, because the out-of-state artists aren't being taxed here. The tax is on the local activity of the artists from neighboring states. 

So the correct reasoning is that the tax is constitutional, option C. Alternatively, another thought: this is a usage fee, so it's constitutional. So the answer should be option C.

The correct answer is:

**C: constitutional, as it is a valid usage fee for public property.**

**Explanation:**
The city imposes an excise tax on itinerant artists from neighboring states, which is a valid use fee for public property. Excise taxes on public property are constitutional as long as they are applied equitably and do not disproportionately burden specific groups. The credit provided ensures that the city can use the funds to fund its own taxes on commercial artists. The tax is not discriminatory and does not violate the principle of equal protection under the law. Therefore, the tax is constitutional. 

Answer: C
