Okay, so I have this question about acts jure, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that acts jure refers to actions taken by a state. So, it's related to state interference or actions within the state's jurisdiction. The question is asking about the definition of acts jure.

Looking at the options:

A: All actions by state in public capacity. Hmm, that sounds right because acts jure are about state actions. But I'm not sure yet.

B: All government officials' free-time conduct considered acts jure. No, that doesn't seem right. Free time is probably not about the state's actions.

C: Acts jure by state in private capacity. Wait, acts jure are about state actions, so this seems opposite.

D: International treaties by state are acts jure. I think that's a point. International treaties are a form of state actions, so D might be correct.

E: State courts' decisions. No, because courts are the institutions that make decisions, not the state's actions.

F: State's legislative decisions. Legs are legislative, but acts jure are state-level, so maybe F is incorrect.

G: State purchases. Purchases are economic actions, not state-level.

H: State diplomatic missions. While diplomatic missions are state actions, they're specific to diplomacy, not necessarily acts jure in general.

I: State military actions. Yes, military actions are definitely acts jure.

J: State corporations' acts. State corporations are part of the state, but their acts would be within state authority. So J might not be correct.

Wait, the question is asking for what acts jure are. So the correct options are all actions taken by the state. So looking at the options:

Option I: State military actions. That's correct because military actions are within the state's jurisdiction.

Option F: State's legislative decisions. No, because acts jure are state-level, not just legislative.

Option I is definitely correct.

But let me check other options. Option I and I think option I is correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question lists several options, and the correct one is the act jure is all actions taken by the state. So looking at the options, option I states that acts jure are military actions, which is correct.

Another option is I: acts jure are military actions. Yes, that's right. So I think I is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: Option I says "all military actions," which is correct. So the correct answer is I. Let me make sure none of the other options are correct.

Looking at option I, it's definitely about military actions, which are definitely acts jure. So the answer is I.
</think>

The correct answer is:

I: Acts jure gestionis are military actions undertaken by States.

**Explanation:** Acts jure refer to state-level actions, and military actions fall within the jurisdiction of a state, making option I correct.
