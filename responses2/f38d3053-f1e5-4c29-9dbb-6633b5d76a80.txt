Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Critical Security Studies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the referent object of security within Critical Security Studies. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's start by recalling what I know about Critical Security Studies (CSS).

CSS, I remember, is a field that examines the security of state and state apparatus. It's more about the specific structures and systems within a state that have been targeted for security analysis. So it's not about general security principles but rather the internal aspects of the state.

Looking at the options:

A: Technological systems — Well, technology is part of the state's security, but I think CSS specifically focuses on the state's own structures. Technological systems might be a part of it, but I'm not sure if that's considered the referent object.

B: The people and their collectives — That's more about civil liberties and individual rights, not necessarily the state's security structures.

C: International organizations — These are more about diplomacy and foreign security, which might not be the focus of CSS since it's state-centric.

D: Economic structures — Again, this is more about how resources are organized and managed, not the state's security.

E: There is no specific referent point. Well, that doesn't make sense. CSS must have a specific object.

F: The environment — That's too vague. Environment could refer to a lot of things, not a specific object.

G: Military power — The military is part of state security, but CSS's referent object would be more about the state's own structures rather than just military power.

H: Non-state actors — These are external entities, not the state itself.

I: Political ideologies — Also about people's views, not the state's own security systems.

J: The state and state apparatus — This seems to fit because CSS is about the state's security structures. The referent object would be the state and its apparatus, right?

Wait, but let me think again. The referent object is the object that is being studied for security. In CSS, the referent is the state and its state apparatus. So the answer would be J: The state and state apparatus.

Alternatively, could it be A: Technological systems? Because TLS, for example, is part of state security. But I think CSS is specifically about state's own structures. So J seems correct.

The referent object of security in Critical Security Studies is the state and its state apparatus. CSS focuses on the state's security structures, so the correct answer is J.

Answer: J: The state and state apparatus.
