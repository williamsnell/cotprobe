Okay, so I have this question about different types of data collection methods, specifically something related to behavioral studies. The question is asking which type of data involves counting the number of occurrences of a behavior observed during a specified time period. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that there are several methods used in behavioral research to observe and measure behaviors. Each method has its own way of data collection. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Partial-interval recording. I think this is a method where a participant is observed during a specific interval, but only a part of the behavior is measured. So they might not get every single data point, but only some. So this doesn't count all occurrences during the time period.

Option B: Whole-interval recording. I believe this is where the entire behavior is observed within the interval, and all the data points are collected. So this method is good for counting occurrences because it ensures that every instance of the behavior is noted. That sounds like the answer because it directly counts occurrences.

Option C: Duration recording. This one probably refers to measuring the duration of a behavior rather than counting occurrences. Like, how long the behavior takes. So this isn't about counting, just measuring duration. So I can probably eliminate C as the answer.

Option D: Time sampling recording. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Time sampling is a method where the researcher observes the subject at fixed intervals but only notes the behaviors that occur at those times without necessarily recording every single event. So it's more about capturing behaviors at specific times but not necessarily counting every occurrence. So D might not be the one.

Option E: Continuous recording. This is about recording behavior continuously, maybe using a watch stating when the behavior occurs. This method is used to get a real-time count, but it's not a traditional method used in behavioral studies. I think it's more about continuous monitoring, not counting occurrences.

Option F: Rate recording. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Rate recording might involve measuring the rate at which a behavior occurs. Like, how many times per minute or something. If it's about counting occurrences, maybe this isn't it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a type of data collection where counts are made, but I'm not certain.

Option G: Frequency recording. This term is a bit confusing. Frequency is about how often something happens, but I'm not sure how this relates to counting. Maybe it's related to duration or something else. I'm not certain about this one.

Option H: Momentary time sampling. This is when the researcher observes the behavior at specific moments in time, not necessarily at regular intervals. So this method might not collect all occurrences because they're spread out in time, not necessarily all during the interval. So I don't think this is the right choice.

Option I: Event recording. I think this is about identifying specific events, like when a behavior occurs, but not counting how many times. So it's more about presence rather than occurrence counts.

Option J: Latency recording. This seems to be about the time it takes from a stimulus to a response. It's about the process, not the count. So not relevant.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is about counting occurrences. So looking back, the only method that directly counts occurrences during a specified time period is whole-interval recording. Because in whole-interval, the entire behavior is observed, and all data points are recorded. Partial-interval, as I thought, only records part of it. Duration uses duration, rate uses rate, etc.

So the correct answer should be option B: Whole-interval recording.

The correct answer is **B: Whole-interval recording**. This method ensures that all occurrences of a behavior are counted during the specified time period, as it observes the entire behavior, including every instance.

Answer: B
