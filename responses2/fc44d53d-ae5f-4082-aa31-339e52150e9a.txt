Okay, so I've got this problem here about Grady and his brother Noah riding bikes. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that Grady rides 60% faster than Noah. So, if Noah's speed is, say, 'v' miles per hour, then Grady's speed would be v plus 60% of v. Let me write that down. 

Grady's speed = v + 0.6v = 1.6v. That makes sense because 60% more is the same as multiplying by 1.6.

Now, it also says that in two hours, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah. Hmm, so in two hours, the distance Grady covers is 12 miles more than Noah's. 

Distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So, the distance Noah rides in two hours is 2v miles. Grady's distance would then be 2 * 1.6v because he's faster. Let me calculate that: 2 * 1.6v = 3.2v miles.

According to the problem, Grady's distance is 12 miles more than Noah's. So, 3.2v = 2v + 12. That equation should help find 'v'.

Subtracting 2v from both sides, I get 3.2v - 2v = 12. That simplifies to 1.2v = 12. To find 'v', I divide both sides by 1.2. 

v = 12 / 1.2. Let me compute that. 12 divided by 1.2 equals 10. So Noah's speed is 10 mph.

Wait, let me double-check. If Noah is going 10 mph, Grady is 1.6 * 10 = 16 mph. In two hours, Noah goes 20 miles (10 mph * 2 hours), and Grady goes 32 miles (16 * 2). The difference is 12 miles, which matches the problem statement. Yep, that makes sense.

The problem states that Grady rides 60% faster than Noah. Let Noah's speed be \( v \) mph. Then Grady's speed is \( 1.6v \) mph. In two hours, Noah covers \( 2v \) miles and Grady covers \( 3.2v \) miles. The difference between Grady's and Noah's distances is 12 miles:

\[
3.2v - 2v = 12 \\
1.2v = 12 \\
v = 10 \text{ mph}
\]
