Okay, so I have this question about affective disorders as described in the DSM-III. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking me to select the correct option that describes what affective disorders are in DSM-III. There are options from A to J. Let me try to recall what I know about the DSM and affective disorders.

First, I remember that the DSM-III categorizes mental disorders into different sections, including affective disorders. Affective disorders are related to mood, so I think they involve feelings of happiness, sadness, anger, etc. They can be categorized into different types like depressive disorders, manic disorders, or bipolar disorder. 

Looking at the options:

A: Affective disorders are always chronic and long lasting. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think that might be more about depression, but I'm not certain. Also, I think some affective disorders can be short-lived, like maybe mild mood changes.

B: They are categorized based on duration, regardless of mood. Wait, I thought mood state is more important. So B might be incorrect because mood state is another factor, not just duration.

C: Only based on predominant mood. That doesn't sound right. Mood isn't the only factor; other symptoms and mood changes are considered.

D: They have mood disturbances and are divided into depressed, manic, or bipolar. Plus, theyâ€™re further divided into episodic, chronic, and atypical. That sounds familiar from what I've read. So D seems correct.

E: Emphasizes external environmental factors. Wait, affective disorders are not limited to external factors. They can be internal as well, like mood swings from stress. So E is probably wrong.

F: Only extreme happiness or mania. Definitely not. There are other forms like sadness, anger, etc.

G: Not recognized before. I think that's incorrect. I remember DSM-III did introduce them, so G is wrong.

H: Single episode without recurrence. No, I think most affective disorders require multiple episodes, so H is incorrect.

I: Only depressive episodes. No, it's not limited to that; manic or hypomanic can also occur.

J: Categorized by cognitive impairments. I don't think so. They're more about mood, not necessarily cognitive issues.

So looking back, the correct option is D. It accurately describes affective disorders as mood-related, with the categories as per DSM-III.

The correct answer is D: Affective disorders are characterized by a disturbance of mood accompanied by related symptoms, and can be categorized into depressed, manic, or bipolar. They are further divided into episodic, chronic, and atypical affective disorders in DSM III.
