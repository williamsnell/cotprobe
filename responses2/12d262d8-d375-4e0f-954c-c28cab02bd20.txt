Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find the range of the function f(x) = 1/(1 - x). Hmm, ranges can sometimes be tricky. So, the range is all the possible output values (y-values) that the function can take.

First, I remember that for a function like this, which is a rational function, the range depends on the behavior of the function as x approaches certain values and its horizontal asymptotes. Let me think about the steps to find the range.

I can start by setting y = f(x), so y = 1/(1 - x). To find the range, I need to solve for x in terms of y and see for which y values this equation has a solution. 

So, let's rearrange the equation:

y = 1/(1 - x)

Multiply both sides by (1 - x) to get rid of the denominator:

y(1 - x) = 1

Expanding the left side:

y - yx = 1

Now, let's get all terms involving x on one side. Let me subtract y from both sides:

-yx = 1 - y

Now, to solve for x, I can divide both sides by -y:

x = (1 - y)/(-y)

Simplify that:

x = (y -1)/y

Wait, checking that step again: (1 - y)/(-y) = (y - 1)/y because (1 - y) is -(y -1). So, yes, x = (1 - y)/(-y) simplifies to (y - 1)/y.

So, x = (y - 1)/y. Now, for this equation to have a solution, the denominator y cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. So y cannot be zero. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, if y = 0, then in the original function f(x) = 1/(1 - x), would y equal zero ever? Let's see: 1/(1 - x) = 0. But 1 divided by something can't be zero because the numerator is 1. So indeed, y cannot be zero.

But wait, is that the only restriction? Let me think again. So, for any y except y=0, there exists an x such that y = f(x). Wait, but let's consider the possibility of y being zero: we've just concluded it's impossible because 1/(1 -x) is never zero. So the range is all real numbers except y=0?

Wait, that can't be right because the function f(x) = 1/(1 - x) can take any value except y=0, but let me think again. Wait, no, that's incorrect because when x approaches 1, 1 - x approaches zero, so y approaches infinity or negative infinity. So the function can take any real value except y=0.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about what y can be. The function f(x) is 1/(1 - x). The denominator 1 - x can't be zero, so x can't be 1. So, the function is defined for all x except x=1. Now, let's see what y can be.

Looking at the function, as x approaches 1 from the left (x approaches 1-), 1 - x approaches zero from the positive side, so y approaches positive infinity. As x approaches 1 from the right (x approaches 1+), 1 - x approaches zero from the negative side, so y approaches negative infinity. 

Now, what about when x is very large positive or negative? Let's take x approaching positive infinity: 1/(1 - x) approaches 0 from the negative side because 1 - x is negative. Similarly, when x approaches negative infinity, 1 - x is positive, so 1/(1 - x) approaches 0 from the positive side. 

So, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, y approaches 0. But y can never actually be zero because that would require 1/(1 - x) = 0, which is impossible.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the cases when y is positive or negative. Let's take y positive: y = 1/(1 - x) > 0. Then, 1 - x must be positive because the reciprocal is positive. So 1 - x > 0 → x < 1. So for y positive, x can be any number less than 1. In this case, y can take any positive value except zero. Wait, but no, for y positive, x can be any real number less than 1, but y can be any positive number. Because as x approaches negative infinity, y approaches zero from the positive side, and as x approaches 1 from below, y approaches positive infinity. So y can take all positive real numbers except zero, but wait, did we just conclude that y can't be zero? That's correct because f(x) can never be zero.

Now, for y negative: y = 1/(1 - x) < 0. That implies that 1 - x must be negative because the reciprocal is negative. So 1 - x < 0 → x > 1. Now, for x > 1, let's see what happens to y. As x approaches 1 from above, y approaches negative infinity. As x approaches positive infinity, y approaches zero from the negative side. So as x increases beyond 1, y becomes a large negative number. So for y negative, y can take any negative value except zero.

Wait, so combining the two cases: y can be any positive or any negative number except zero. So the range is all real numbers except zero.

Wait, but checking the options, I don't see any option that says "All real numbers except 0". Let me look at the options:

Option F is (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞) which is exactly all real numbers except zero. So that's F.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake. Let me think again: when y is positive, x < 1, so y can be any positive number but not zero. Similarly, when y is negative, x > 1, so y can be any negative number but not zero. So the range is all real numbers except zero. So the correct interval notation is (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞), which is option F.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the inverse function. Let me set y = f(x) = 1/(1 - x). Then, solving for x in terms of y gives x = (1 - y)/y, as I did earlier. Now, the denominator y can't be zero, so y ≠ 0. So x exists for every y except y=0. Therefore, the range is all real numbers except zero, so option F.
</think>

The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} \) can be analyzed by expressing y in terms of x: \( y = \frac{1}{1 - x} \). Solving for x gives \( x = \frac{y - 1}{y} \), which is valid for all y except y = 0. This means the range of f(x) is all real numbers except zero. The correct interval notation is \( (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty) \), which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
