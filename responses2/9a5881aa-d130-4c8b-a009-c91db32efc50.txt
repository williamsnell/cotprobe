Question:

Define and describe incidental memory and subliminal perception(subception).

Options:

A: Incidental memory and subliminal perception are both processes that involve a high level of conscious effort and attention in order to encode and retrieve stimuli.
B: Incidental memory is the conscious recall of stimuli
C: Incidental memory is the intentional memorization of stimuli for later retrieval, while subliminal perception refers to stimuli that are too weak to be noticed but still influence behavior.
D: Subliminal perception is the ability to perceive and recall stimuli that are presented at high speeds, whereas incidental memory is a type of memory that is used for routine tasks.
E: Incidental memory and subliminal perception both require the subject's awareness
F: Incidental memory is the retrieval of information that was encoded during a state of distraction, whereas subliminal perception refers to the perception of stimuli that have been consciously ignored.
G: Subliminal perception is consciously perceiving high intensity stimuli
H: Incidental memory involves the unconscious retention of information from daily experiences, while subliminal perception is the perception of stimuli that are presented above the conscious threshold but not remembered.
I: Incidental memory refers to the recall of stimuli that never reached the subject's state of awareness. Subliminal perception, also called subception, is when a stimulus is presented just below the threshold at which it can be consciously perceived.
J: Incidental memory is the deliberate memorization of information using mnemonic devices, and subliminal perception is the conscious perception of low intensity stimuli.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about incidental memory and subliminal perception. I need to figure out which options are correct. Let me start by understanding each term.

First, I'll try to remember what each term means. Incidental memory, if I recall, is about the spontaneous recollection of information. It's not something you consciously notice or do, but rather something that happens without effort. I think it's a type of unconscious memory. So, in the options, I should look for statements that describe it as involving no conscious effort or involving a high level of conscious effort.

Subliminal perception, I'm not as sure about. Subliminal is something I've heard related to psychology, maybe about stimuli that are just beyond the conscious threshold. So, when a stimulus is just high enough to be detected but not enough to be noticed, that's subliminal. It's about stimuli that are too weak to be noticed but still influence behavior. So, I should look for options that describe subliminal perception as involving stimuli too weak to notice but influencing behavior.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both involve high conscious effort. Well, I thought subliminal doesn't require conscious effort, but both might. Incidental requires no conscious effort because it's spontaneous, while subliminal might involve some, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is incorrect because subliminal perception doesn't require conscious effort.

Option B: Incidental is conscious recall. That sounds more accurate because I remember that incidentals are conscious. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Incidental is about intentional memorization, subliminal is weak stimuli. That seems correct. Incidental is intentional, right? And subliminal is stimuli just too weak to notice, so C seems accurate.

Option D: Subliminal is about high-speed presentation, and incidental is routine tasks. No, that seems mixed up. Subliminal is about stimuli presented at high speed but not consciously perceived. Incidental is about spontaneous recall, not about speed. So D seems incorrect.

Option E: Both require awareness. Hmm, subliminal doesn't require awareness, as it's about stimuli just above threshold. Incidental doesn't need awareness either. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval during distraction, subliminal is consciously ignored. That makes sense. Incidental is when you recall info without being aware of it, like during a moment of distraction, whereas subliminal is when you're aware but not noticing. So F sounds correct.

Option G: Subliminal is consciously perceiving high-intensity. No, I think subliminal is about low-intensity, not high. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Incidental is mnemonic devices, and subliminal is conscious perception of low stimuli. Wait, H says incantational devices, but I thought it's about mnemonic devices. Also, H says subliminal is conscious, which contradicts my earlier understanding. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Incidental is deliberate memorization, subliminal is conscious perception. Wait, I'm a bit confused. From what I remember, subliminal perception is when you're aware but not noticing the stimuli. Incidental is when you just recall without conscious effort. So I think I might be mixing things up. Option I says subliminal is conscious, which is correct, but I'm not sure about the incantational part. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Option J: Incidental is deliberate memorization, subliminal is conscious perception of low stimuli. Wait, subliminal perception is about just above the threshold, not high. So J's second part is incorrect. So J is wrong.

Going back to the options, which ones are correct.

C and F seem correct. Let me think again.

C: Incidental is intentional memorization, subliminal is too weak to notice but influence.

F: Incidental is retrieval during distraction, subliminal is conscious perception of ignored stimuli.

I think I had the options wrong earlier.

Wait, going back to the definitions:

Incidental memory is when you recall something without being aware of it. It's spontaneous. So in F, it's about retrieval during a state of distraction, which aligns.

Subliminal perception is when you're aware but the stimuli are just above the threshold. So F's second part is correct.

So looking at the options:

Which options are correct?

Option C: Incidental involves intentional, subliminal is too weak.

Option F: Incidental is about retrieval during distraction, subliminal is conscious.

So let's see the options again.

Option C: Incidental involves intentional; correct.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval during distraction; correct.

So both C and F would be correct? But looking through the options, only one of the options should be correct, or perhaps the correct answer is a combination of some.

Wait, the question is to choose the correct description. Let's look at options again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the exact options.

Looking again:

Option C: Incidental is intentional memorization, subliminal is too weak.

Option F: Incidental is retrieval during distraction, subliminal is consciously perceived.

So both C and F seem correct. But wait, the options are single choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me think about what each term actually is.

Incidental memory: This is the spontaneous, automatic recall of information without conscious effort. It's not a conscious process; it's just a memory.

Subliminal perception: This is the perceiving of stimuli that are just above the threshold for conscious perception. It's a phenomenon where stimuli are presented in a way that's just beyond the conscious threshold but are perceived.

So, looking at the options, option C seems correct. Option F's first part is correct, but the second part of F is incorrect because subliminal is not conscious perception but just above the threshold, not conscious. So F's second part is incorrect. Therefore, only option C is correct.

Wait, but option F's second part: "subliminal perception refers to the conscious perception of stimuli that have been consciously ignored." No, that's not right. Subliminal is the perception of stimuli that are too weak to be noticed but still influence behavior. So option F's second part is incorrect. Therefore, only option C is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

C: Incidental is intentional, subliminal is too weak.

F: Incidental is during distraction, subliminal is conscious.

So, the correct answer would be either C or F.

Wait, the question is about what each term is.

So, the correct statements are:

Incidental memory is the spontaneous recall, which is a type of memory (non-conscious, no conscious effort). Subliminal perception is stimuli just above the threshold.

Looking at the options, the correct options are C and F.

But the options are single choice, so perhaps the answer is two options, but the way the question is asked, I have to choose one.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each is a statement. So the correct answer is the option that correctly describes both terms.

Wait, perhaps only one of the options is correct. So which one is correct?

Let me look at each option:

A: Both involve high conscious effort. I'm not sure. Subliminal doesn't involve any conscious effort. So A is incorrect.

B: Incidental is conscious recall. No, because it's spontaneous. B is incorrect.

C: Correct as per definitions.

D: Subliminal is high speed, incorrect. Incidental is for routine tasks. So D is incorrect.

E: Both require awareness. No, subliminal doesn't. So E is incorrect.

F: Correct. Incidental is during distraction, subliminal is conscious.

G: Subliminal is consciously perceiving high. No, that's wrong.

H: Incidental is mnemonic devices. No, that's wrong. Also, subliminal is not conscious, so H is incorrect.

J: Incidental is deliberate memorization. Subliminal is conscious perception of low. Hmm, J's second part is wrong, so J is incorrect.

Thus, the correct options are C and F. But the options are single choices, so perhaps the correct answer is C and F. But looking at the options, maybe only one is correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-express the options.

Looking at C, the first part is correct. The second part says subliminal is too weak to be noticed but still influence. That's correct.

But the other option, F, is correct too, but perhaps in the options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look at the possible answers again.

Which of the options correctly describe both terms.

Looking at the options, option C correctly states both. Option F says Incidental is about retrieval during distraction (correct), and subliminal is conscious perception (incorrect). So F's second part is wrong.

Therefore, the correct option is C.
</think>

The correct answer is **C**: Incidental memory is the intentional memorization of stimuli for later retrieval, while subliminal perception refers to stimuli that are too weak to be noticed but still influence behavior. This option accurately describes both terms. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because it suggests both processes involve high conscious effort, which is not true for subliminal perception.
- **Option B** is incorrect because it describes incidental memory as conscious recall, which is not accurate.
- **Option C** correctly identifies incidental memory as intentional memorization and subliminal perception as stimuli just above the conscious threshold.
- **Option D** is incorrect because it misrepresents subliminal perception and incidental memory.
- **Option E** is incorrect because it claims both processes require awareness, which is false for subliminal perception.
- **Option F** is partially correct but misdescribes subliminal perception as conscious perception, which is incorrect.
- **Option G** is incorrect because it states subliminal perception is consciously perceiving high intensity stimuli.
- **Option H** is incorrect because it misrepresents incidental memory and subliminal perception.
- **Option J** is incorrect because it misdescribes incidental memory as deliberate memorization and subliminal perception as conscious perception of low stimuli.

Thus, the correct option is **C**.
