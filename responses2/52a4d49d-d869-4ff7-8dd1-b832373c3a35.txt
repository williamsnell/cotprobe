Okay, so I've got this question about Dry Ice and a wine bottle. Let me see what I can remember. Dry Ice is CO2, right? And the question says a 20g chunk is placed in a 0.75 liter wine bottle that's tightly corked. The temperature is 25°C. I need to find the final pressure in the bottle after CO2 evaporates and the temperature is 25°C.

Hmm, I remember that when you stuff dry ice into a bottle, it sublimes, right? So it turns from solid to gas without changing temperature. The CO2 will first be in the solid form, then it turns into a gas as it sublimes. The bottle is sealed, so the volume is fixed, and the temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K.

The question is about the pressure when all the CO2 has evaporated. Wait, but since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 can't escape. So, the pressure would be the vapor pressure of CO2 at 25°C, right? Because the bottle's volume is constant, and the amount of CO2 doesn't change (it's all gone into vapor). So the pressure it exerts is the vapor pressure of CO2 at that temperature.

Wait, but how do I calculate that? The ideal gas law comes into play here. PV = nRT. But wait, the amount of CO2 is in grams, so I need to find moles first. CO2 has a molar mass of about 44 grams per mole. So 20 grams divided by 44 g/mol. Let me compute that: 20 /44 ≈ 0.4545 moles.

The volume is 0.75 liters, which is 0.00075 m³ or 0.75 dm³. Wait, no, wait: 1 liter is 0.001 m³. So 0.75 liters is 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 m³? Wait, no, wait, 1 L is 1e-3 m³. So 0.75 L is 0.75 * 1e-3 = 0.00075 m³? No, wait, 1 L is 0.001 m³. So 0.75 L is 0.75 * 0.001 m³ = 0.00075 m³? No, wait, no, 1 L is 1 cubic decimeter, which is 0.001 cubic meters. So 0.75 L is 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 m³. Correct.

Temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K.

R is the gas constant. I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using those units. So n is 0.4545 mol, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 298 K, V is 0.75 L.

Wait, but wait. Using PV = nRT, so solving for P: P = nRT/V.

So let me plug the numbers in.

n = 0.4545 mol
R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
T = 298 K
V = 0.75 L

So P = (0.4545 * 0.0821 * 298) / 0.75

Let me compute numerator first: 0.4545 * 0.0821 = approx 0.03735. Multiply by 298: 0.03735 * 298 ≈ 11.186.

Then divide by 0.75: 11.186 / 0.75 ≈ 14.915 atm.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I should be more precise.

Wait, n = 20g /44g/mol = 0.454545... moles exactly. So 0.454545 mol.

R = 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K) (I think that's a more precise value).

So 0.454545 * 0.082057 = let's compute:

0.454545 * 0.082057 ≈ 0.03735.

3735 * 0.000001? Wait, maybe better to compute 0.454545 * 0.082057.

Let me calculate 0.45 * 0.08 = 0.036.

Wait, exact calculation: 0.454545 * 0.082057.

0.454545 * 0.08 = 0.0363636.

0.454545 * 0.002057 = let's compute 0.454545 * 0.002 = 0.00090909, 0.454545 * 0.000057 ≈ 0.0000259.

So total ≈ 0.0363636 + 0.00090909 + 0.0000259 ≈ 0.03730.

Multiply this by T =298: 0.03730 * 298 = ?

0.03730 * 300 = 11.19. But subtract 0.03730*(2) =0.0746, so 11.19 -0.0746≈ 11.1154.

So numerator is ~11.1154.

Divide by V=0.75 L: 11.1154 /0.75 ≈ 14.8205 atm.

So about 14.82 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 14.81 atm. So the answer should be A.

To determine the final pressure in the wine bottle after all the CO₂ has evaporated, we use the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), where \( P \) is the pressure, \( n \) is the number of moles, \( R \) is the gas constant, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( V \) is the volume. Since the bottle is sealed, the volume is constant, and the CO₂ is entirely in the gas phase after evaporation, so the pressure corresponds to the vapor pressure of CO₂ at 25°C.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of CO₂
The mass of CO₂ is 20 g, and its molar mass is 44 g/mol. Thus:
\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{20}{44} \approx 0.4545 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert temperature to Kelvin
The temperature is 25°C, which is:
\[
T = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Use the ideal gas law to calculate pressure
The volume of the bottle is 0.75 L, and the gas constant \( R \) is \( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \). Substituting into \( PV = nRT \):
\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P = \frac{(0.4545)(0.0821)(298.15)}{0.75}.
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculations
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
0.4545 \times 0.0821 \approx 0.03735,
\]
\[
0.03735 \times 298.15 \approx 11.115.
\]
Then divide by the volume:
\[
P = \frac{11.115}{0.75} \approx 14.82 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
The calculated pressure of approximately 14.82 atm corresponds to option A.
