Section 22 of the city's reform act of 2010, which is to become effective on January 1, 2010, provides: "Any parent or guardian financially responsible for the education of his ward may claim a direct tax credit against his income tax liability equal to the amount of tuition of a child or children of high school age who does not attend a public high school. " Other provisions define "tuition" very broadly but limit the credit to tuition paid to schools meeting the educational requirements as determined by the state. On December 1, 2009, the parents of two students who attend a public high school in the state sue for a declaratory judgment and injunction in federal court, claiming that Section 22 violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the First Amendment and whether the state law violates it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The state imposes a graduated income tax on net income calculated under federal law. Section 22 allows parents of high school students to claim a direct tax credit for tuition paid to public high schools. The issue is that on December 1, 2009, the parents sue for a declaratory judgment and injunction because Section 22 might violate the establishment clause.

Okay, so the question is about whether the state's law is violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Establishment Clause prohibits states from requiring their citizens to engage in a state's essential way of life. So, if Section 22 is requiring parents to pay tuition, that's part of the essential way of life because it's a fundamental right.

The plaintiffs argue that Section 22 is part of the state's essential way of life, so it violates the Establishment Clause. But how do they stand?

I remember that the Establishment Clause requires that a state's laws not be used to deny a citizen the right to a fundamental way of life. So, the state can't make a parent pay their own tuition to a public high school because that would require them to engage in a life that's considered essential. 

But wait, the question mentions the " educational requirements as determined by the state." So, the state might have certain criteria for what counts as a public high school. If the state defines public high school as those that meet those criteria, then the parents could be justified in claiming the credit.

Wait, but the problem is that the state's definition might be problematic. If the state's definition is arbitrary, it's unclear whether that's part of the state's fundamental way of life. The law could be using a policy (the definition) to deny the parent the right to education, which might be seen as a violation.

Alternatively, the parental claim is about the tax credit. But the question is about the law being used to deny their right as a taxpayer. So, if Section 22 is part of the state's essential way of life, then the parental claim that it violates the Establishment Clause would be valid.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What's the exact line here. The state law is requiring parents to pay tuition. That is a right. If the state's law is part of their fundamental way of life, then the parental claim against it is valid.

But I recall that the Establishment Clause requires that the state's laws do not interfere with the right to engage in a state's essential way of life. So, if Section 22 is part of that essential way of life, then it's a violation.

Alternatively, the state's definition of public high school might be considered a policy that the state is using to deny the parent the right to go to school, which is part of their essential way of life. So, the state's law might be using a policy that's a part of their essential way of life, thus violating the Establishment Clause.

Wait, another angle: the question is whether the state's law requires parents to engage in a state's essential way of life. If the law is a requirement to pay tuition, then yes. But if the law is meant to restrict the right to education, that's a different matter. But in this case, the law is a requirement to pay tuition, which is part of the essential way of life.

So the parents are claiming that their right as a taxpayer is being violated because the state law imposes this requirement. If the law is part of the state's essential way of life, then their claim is valid.

But I'm not sure whether the state's definition of public school is part of the essential way of life. If the state's definition is arbitrary, it's unclear. However, the law's claim is that it's a requirement to pay tuition, which is a state's essential way of life, making the parental claim valid.

Wait, but the issue is whether the state's law is actually part of the state's essential way of life. The law is a requirement to pay the tuition, which is part of the essential way of life because it's a fundamental right.

So the parents are correct, and the court should uphold the action. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes states' definitions can be seen as arbitrary and thus not part of the essential way of life.

Alternatively, the state's definition might be part of the essential way of life, so the parental claim is valid. But if the definition is arbitrary, then the state isn't using the law to interfere with the parent's right as a taxpayer.

Wait, but the question is about whether the law violates the establishment clause. The law is requiring parents to pay tuition, which is part of a state's essential right. So the parental claim is valid.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. The state's law is a requirement to pay tuition. The establishment clause prohibits the state from requiring citizens to engage in a state's essential way of life. Here, the state's essential way of life includes the right to education. The law is imposing a requirement on parents to pay tuition, which is part of that essential way of life. So, the parental claim that the law violates the Establishment Clause is valid.

Wait, but another perspective: the law is a requirement to pay tuition, which is a state's right. So, the parents are correctly suing because the state's law is part of their essential way of life, thus violating the Establishment Clause.

So, looking at the answer options, option C says "upset the action because the plaintiffs have a valid claim under the First Amendment." That sounds correct.

Alternatively, some might argue that the law is a requirement to pay tuition, which is a state's right, so it's not a violation. But that's not the case because the law is imposing a requirement on a right, which is part of the state's essential way of life.

Wait, but another point: the law is a requirement to pay tuition. The state's essential way of life includes the right to education. So, the law is imposing a requirement on a state's essential right, so the parental claim is valid. So the court should uphold the action.

Wait, but the issue is that the law is a requirement to pay tuition, which is a state's essential right. So the law is part of the state's essential way of life, which means the parental claim is valid.

So the action should be upheld, which points me towards option C.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me recap: The question is whether Section 22 violates the establishment clause. The state's law requires parents to pay tuition, which is a state's essential right. So the state's law is a requirement to engage in a state's essential way of life, thus violating the Establishment Clause.

So the court should order the parents to pay, which is option C.

The question revolves around whether Section 22 of the city's reform act of 2010 violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Section 22 requires parents of high school students to pay tuition, which is a state's essential right. The Establishment Clause prohibits states from imposing requirements that interfere with citizens' access to their state's essential way of life.

The plaintiffs argue that Section 22 is part of the state's essential way of life, making their claim valid under the Establishment Clause. The court must determine whether the state's law imposes a requirement that violates this clause.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The court would not uphold the action if the state law does not discriminate against public school students, as the Essential Way of Life Clause requires no such discrimination.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The suit involves a political question, not a factual issue, so the court would not dismiss it.
- **Option C**: Correct. The parents have a valid claim under the Establishment Clause as Section 22 is a state's essential right.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The plaintiffs have suffered actual harm, so there is no need for standing.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The parental claim is not based on lack of standing.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The issue is not moot; the law is relevant.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The issues are ripe; the law is currently in effect.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The law does not violate the Establishment Clause; the state is not using it to interfere with a right as a taxpayer.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The court does not have jurisdiction over a state's law that affects a citizen's rights.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The law does not violate the Establishment Clause because it is a requirement to engage in a state's essential way of life.

The court should uphold the action because Section 22 is part of the state's essential way of life, violating the Establishment Clause.

**ANSWER: C**
