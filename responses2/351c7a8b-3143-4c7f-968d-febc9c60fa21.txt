Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what fraction of India's population used the internet in the past three months as of 2017. Hmm, I remember a bit about demographic trends, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I know that India's internet penetration has been growing over the years, but I'm not certain about the exact data for 2017. I think it's around 50% or so, but I might be mixing that up with other countries. Wait, no, I think India's internet penetration rate was higher back then. Maybe it was around 60% or even 70% by 2017. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

I should consider the historical context. India has been a rapidly urbanizing country, so a larger population would have more internet users. Also, the internet was becoming more accessible, especially with the growth of mobile networks. But I'm not sure about the exact percentage.

Another approach is to look at the data from sources. I remember that the World Bank or other official statistics might have this information. But since I don't have access right now, I'll have to rely on what I can recall. From what I've heard, India's internet penetration rate in the mid to late 2000s was around 50-60%. 

Looking at the options provided, option D is 60%, which seems plausible. Let me check the options again. The options are A:37, B:33, C:22, D:60, E:15, F:48, G:56, H:41, I:11, J:26%. So 60% is an option, and I think that's the correct one. 

Wait, but sometimes people might refer to the number as a percentage of the population, not the internet usage. So, if the internet usage was 60%, that would mean 60% of the population was using the internet. But I think the question is asking for the fraction of the population in the past three months, which would be the same as internet usage since it's the same group. So yeah, 60% is the correct answer.

The correct answer is D: 60%. This is because India's internet penetration rate in the past three months as of 2017 was approximately 60%, reflecting a significant portion of the population being connected to the internet at that time. 

Answer: D
