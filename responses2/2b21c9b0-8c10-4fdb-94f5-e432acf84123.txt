Okay, I have to calculate the force on an alpha particle passing a gold nucleus at a certain distance. Hmm... I remember that alpha particles are helium nuclei, so they're positively charged. The gold nucleus is a gold atom, which has a specific charge and mass.

Wait, I think the formula for the electric force between two charged particles is Coulomb's law. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant. Coulomb's constant is about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C², right?

First, I need to find out the charges of the particles. An alpha particle is He²+, which means it has a +2 charge. The gold nucleus, Au, has a charge of +118 since gold has 118 protons. So each alpha particle has a charge of +2e, where e is the elementary charge (1.602 x 10^-19 C). So q1 is +2e and q2 is +118e.

Wait, but in Coulomb's law, the product of the charges' magnitudes is what matters, so the signs can be ignored because we're dealing with the magnitude. So |q1 * q2| is (2e)(118e) = 236 e².

Next, the distance between them is given in angstroms. Oh wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. The distance is 0.00300 Å, so that's 0.00300 * 1e-10 = 3e-13 meters.

Now, the force F would be k * (2e * 118e) / (r²). Let me plug in the numbers. Let's compute step by step.

Wait, let me write out the equation:

F = (8.988e9) * (2 * 1.602e-19) * (118 * 1.602e-19) / ( (3e-13)^2 )

Wait, wait, but wait a second: the formula is F = k * q1 * q2 / r². So each e is 1.602e-19 C, so 2e is 3.204e-19, 118e is 190.96e-19? No, wait, 118 * e is 118 * 1.602e-19 = let me compute that.

Wait, 1.602e-19 C * 118 = 1.602 * 118 = 190.076, so it's 1.90076e-17 C. So q1 is 3.204e-19 C, q2 is 1.90076e-17 C.

So the product is (3.204e-19) * (1.90076e-17) = let's compute that.

3.204 * 1.90076 ≈ 3.204 * 1.9 is approximately 6.0876. Wait, but more precisely, 3.204 * 1.90076: 1.90076 is approximately 1.9008. Let me multiply 3.204 by 1.9008.

3.204 * 1.9008 = let me compute:

3 * 1.9008 = 5.7024
0.204 * 1.9008 = 0.204 *1.9 = 0.3876, and 0.204 * 0.0008 = 0.0001632. So total 0.3876 + 0.0001632 = about 0.3877632.

So the product is 5.7024 + 0.3877632 = 6.09016 C².

So the numerator is k * 6.09016e-36 (since 1e-19 * 1e-17 = 1e-36). Wait, wait, let me check the exponents. Each e is 1e-19, so 2e is 2e-19, 118e is 118e-19. So 2e *118e = 236 e-38, which is 236e-38 C².

Wait, wait, no: 2e is (2 * 1e-19) C, 118e is (118 * 1e-19) C. So product is (2e-19) * (118e-19) = 236 * (1e-38) C². So 236e-38 → 2.36e-36 C².

So the numerator is 8.988e9 * 2.36e-36 = ?

Calculating 8.988e9 * 2.36e-36 = (8.988 * 2.36) * 1e9 * 1e-36.

8.988 * 2.36 → let's compute that.

Approximately, 9 * 2.36 is 21.24, but 8.988 is 0.012 less, so 21.24 - (0.012 * 2.36) → 21.24 - 0.02832 = 21.21168. So about 21.2117.

So 21.2117 * 1e(9-36) = 21.2117e-27 → 2.12117e-26.

Denominator is r squared. r is 3e-13 m, so r squared is (3e-13)^2 = 9e-26 m².

So F = (2.12117e-26) / (9e-26) → 2.12117 /9 = approx 0.2357 N.

Wait, that's about 0.236 N. Let me double-check that, because I'm not sure about the exponents.

Wait, let me recount:

Numerators: 8.988e9 * 236e-38 = 8.988 * 236 * 1e9 * 1e-38 → 8.988 * 236 = let's compute 8 * 236 = 1888, 0.988 *236 is about 232.768 → total 2120.768. So 2120.768e-29? Wait, because 1e9 *1e-38=1e-29. So 2120.768e-29 → 2.120768e-26.

Denominator: (3e-13)^2 = 9e-26.

So F = 2.120768e-26 / 9e-26 = 0.23564 N.

Wait, 0.23564 is approximately 0.236 N.

Looking at the options, let me check which one is around that. The options are:

A: 0.508, B:0.505, C:0.605, D:0.305, E:0.105, F:0.405, G:0.302, H:0.509, I:0.205, J:0.705.

Oh wait, option I is 0.205, option D is 0.305. My calculation is approx 0.236, which is closest to option I (0.205) or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me go through the calculations again, perhaps I messed up a step.

Alternative approach: let me compute everything more precisely.

Compute q1 = 2e = 2 * 1.602176634e-19 C = 3.204353268e-19 C.

q2 = 118e = 118 * 1.602176634e-19 C = let's compute that.

118 * 1.602176634 = let's calculate:

100 * 1.602176634 = 160.2176634

18 * 1.602176634 = 28.83917941

Adding those gives 160.2176634 + 28.83917941 = 189.05684284 → so q2 = 1.8905684284e-17 C.

So product q1*q2 is 3.204353268e-19 * 1.8905684284e-17.

Multiply 3.204353268 * 1.8905684284.

Let me compute this:

3 * 1.890568 is about 5.6717.

0.204353 * 1.890568 → Let's compute 0.2 *1.890568 = 0.3781136, and 0.004353 *1.890568 ≈ 0.00825. So total 0.3781136 + 0.00825 = 0.38636.

So total product is approx 5.6717 + 0.38636 = 6.05806.

So 6.05806e-36 (since 1e-19 * 1e-17 = 1e-36).

So F = (8.988e9) * (6.05806e-36) / ( (3e-13)^2 )

Denominator r² = (3e-13)^2 → 9e-26.

So F = (8.988e9 * 6.05806e-36) / 9e-26.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *6.05806e-36 = 8.988 *6.05806 *1e9 *1e-36 → 8.988 * 6.05806 = approx 54.45 → 54.45e-27 → 5.445e-26.

Denominator 9e-26.

So F = 5.445e-26 / 9e-26 → 5.445 /9 = 0.605 N.

Wait, that's about 0.605 N. So that corresponds to option F, which is 0.405, no wait option F is 0.405, but 0.605 isn't one of the options. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait let me recheck the calculations. Maybe I messed up a step.

Wait, let me recalculate the product q1*q2.

q1 = 2e → 2 * 1.602176634e-19 = 3.204353268e-19 C.

q2 = 118e → 118 * 1.602176634e-19 = let me compute 118 * 1.602176634.

118 * 1.602176634:

Let me compute 100 * 1.602176634 = 160.2176634.

18 * 1.602176634 = 28.839179412.

Adding 160.2176634 +28.839179412 = 189.0568428.

So q2 is 189.0568428e-19 C → 1.890568428e-17 C.

So q1*q2 = 3.204353268e-19 * 1.890568428e-17.

Multiply 3.204353268 *1.890568428.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.204353268 * 1.890568428.

I can compute using a calculator-like approach:

3 * 1.890568428 = 5.671705284.

0.204353268 * 1.890568428.

Calculate 0.2 *1.890568428 = 0.3781136856.

0.004353268 *1.890568428 = approximately 0.00825.

Adding 0.3781136856 + 0.00825 = 0.3863636856.

So total product is 5.671705284 + 0.3863636856 = 6.05806897 N.

Wait, so q1*q2 = 6.05806897e-36 C².

So the numerator is 8.988e9 * 6.05806897e-36.

Compute 8.988e9 * 6.05806897e-36.

Multiply 8.988 by 6.05806897 ≈ 54.45.

So numerator is 54.45e-27 → 5.445e-26.

Denominator: (3e-13)^2 = 9e-26.

So F = 5.445e-26 / 9e-26 = 5.445 / 9 = 0.605 N.

So the force is about 0.605 N, which is option F: 0.405 is not, but option F is 0.405. Wait, wait, no. Let me check the options. Oh, no—option F is 0.405. Hmm, but according to my calculation, I get 0.605, which is option F. But looking back, the options are:

A: 0.508

B:0.505

C:0.605

D:0.305

E:0.105

F: 0.405

G:0.302

H:0.509

I:0.205

J:0.705

Wait, so option C is 0.605 N, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C, 0.605 N.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated, I thought I got 0.605, but I thought the options might have 0.236, but that was a miscalculation.

Wait no, wait, I think I made a mistake when recalculating. Let me recheck:

Wait, when I calculated the product q1*q2, I thought it was 6.058e-36, which is correct, right? Then, 8.988e9 multiplied by that gives 5.445e-26.

Denominator is 9e-26, so 5.445e-26 /9e-26 = 5.445/9 = 0.605. So the force is 0.605 N, which is option C.

So the correct answer is option C.

To calculate the force on an alpha particle passing a gold nucleus at a given distance, we use Coulomb's law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the charges and constants
- The alpha particle has a charge of \( q_1 = +2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). Thus, \( q_1 = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \).
- The gold nucleus has a charge of \( q_2 = +118e \), where \( 118e = 1.890 \times 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{C} \).
- Coulomb's constant is \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the product of charges
\[
q_1 \cdot q_2 = (3.204 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (1.890 \times 10^{-17}) = 6.058 \times 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{C^2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the denominator \( r^2 \)
The distance between the alpha particle and the gold nucleus is \( r = 0.00300 \, \mathrm{\AA} = 0.00300 \cdot 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} = 3.00 \times 10^{-13} \, \mathrm{m} \). Thus:
\[
r^2 = (3.00 \times 10^{-13})^2 = 9.00 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{m^2}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the force
\[
F = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (6.058 \times 10^{-36})}{9.00 \times 10^{-26}}
\]

1. **Numerators**: \( 8.988 \times 6.058 = 54.45 \), so:
\[
8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 6.058 \times 10^{-36} = 54.45 \times 10^{-27} = 5.445 \times 10^{-26}
\]

2. **Denominator**: \( 9.00 \times 10^{-26} \)

3. **Force**:
\[
F = \frac{5.445 \times 10^{-26}}{9.00 \times 10^{-26}} = \frac{5.445}{9.00} = 0.605 \, \mathrm{N}
\]

### Step 5: Match the result with the options
The calculated force is \( 0.605 \, \mathrm{N} \), which corresponds to **option C**.
