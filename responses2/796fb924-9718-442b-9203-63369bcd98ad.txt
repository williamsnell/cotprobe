Okay, so John got a job where he can earn $49 by handing out flyers. He worked 3.5 hours, and he wants to find out his hourly rate. The problem uses the equation 3.5x = 49, where x is the hourly rate. I need to find x, which is his pay per hour.

Hmm, let me think. So, the equation is 3.5 multiplied by x equals 49. To find x, I should divide both sides of the equation by 3.5. That way, I can solve for x.

Let me write that down: x = 49 / 3.5. Now, I need to compute that division. 3.5 goes into 49 how many times? Well, 3.5 times 10 is 35, which is smaller than 49. Let's try 14. 3.5 times 14 is 49 because 3.5 times 10 is 35, and 3.5 times 4 is 14, so 35 plus 14 is 49. So, 3.5 multiplied by 14 equals 49.

Wait, let me double-check that. 3.5 multiplied by 14: 3 times 14 is 42, and 0.5 times 14 is 7, so 42 plus 7 is 49. Yep, that's correct.

So, x is 14 dollars per hour. Looking at the options, option H is $14.00. So, the answer should be H.

The equation 3.5x = 49 represents the total earnings ($49) divided by the hours worked (3.5 hours). Solving for x, the hourly rate, we divide 49 by 3.5, which equals 14. Thus, John's hourly rate is $14.00.

Answer: H
