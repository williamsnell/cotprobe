Alright, let's try to figure out this question. So, the question is about Erich Fromm and his statements regarding society. The key point here is understanding what societal behavior can facilitate a person realizing their true nature.

From what I remember, Erich Fromm talked about how society imposes structures and pressures, and that in some cases, it can actually help people realize their true self. The question is asking which societal behavior allows someone to realize their true nature of being loving, creative, and productive.

Looking at the options, I need to think about what each term means. 

- Option A: authoritative. I'm not sure how authoritative behavior would help realize true nature. It might help in handling situations, maybe, but I don't think it directly leads to realizing true self.

- Option B: productive. This seems relevant because productive behavior is about making things, which could relate to creativity and maybe even the creative aspects of being productive.

- Option C: destructive. That seems opposite, as destructive behavior is against societal norms and might not help realizing true self.

- Option D: exploitative. Exploitation is about taking advantage of others, which doesn't seem to help realize true self.

- Option E: manipulative. Manipulative can be about controlling others, but I don't see how it directly helps realize true nature.

- Option F: marketing. Marketing is about selling or promoting, which doesn't seem to relate to realizing true self.

- Option G: hoarding. This is about storing things, which doesn't seem to align with realizing true nature.

- Option H: submissive. This is about being controlled, which might not help realize true self but could help in adapting to societal expectations.

- Option I: controlling. This is similar to authoritative, and I'm not sure how controlling behavior would help realize true nature.

- Option J: receptive. This term refers to accepting or responding to what society expects. I think receptive can lead to recognizing one's true nature because it's about accepting the system, which might be part of realizing true self.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says the societies prevent realizing true nature. So societal demands that don't impose too much pressure might allow realization. Replying to societal demands, which are sources of pressure, but perhaps some allow for the realization.

From what I recall, Fromm's point is that some societal structures, like constructive ones, can help people realize their true nature. So the options that don't impose too much, like being receptive, might be the ones that help.

Looking back, option J says receptive. So when society expects you to respond to it, it's like taking in the information and recognizing your true nature. That makes sense.

So the correct answer should be J: The receptive allows a person to realize its true nature, to be loving, creative, productive.

The correct answer is **J: The receptive allows a person to realize its true nature, to be loving, creative, productive**.

**Explanation:**
The question revolves around understanding how societal behaviors can facilitate the realization of one's true nature. From Erich Fromm, we know that certain societal behaviors can help individuals recognize their true self. The term "receptive" refers to accepting societal expectations, which is crucial for realizing one's true nature. This behavior helps in recognizing and integrating with one's true self, aligning with Fromm's assertion that societal structures can sometimes aid in this realization.
