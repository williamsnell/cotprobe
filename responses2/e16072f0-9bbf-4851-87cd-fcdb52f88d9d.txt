Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the ground-state energy of positronium. Hmm, let's see. Positronium is like a positronium atom, right? It's just an electron and a positron orbiting each other. Wait, both particles have the same charge, +e and -e, but since they're the same mass, their masses are equal. Oh wait, the positronium is similar to a hydrogen atom, but with electrons and positrons instead of a proton and electron.

I remember that the ground state energy in hydrogen is -13.6 eV. But wait, that's for a hydrogen atom with a single proton and electron. But here, since both particles are identical and their masses are the same, the energy should be a bit different. Oh right, the formula for the energy in the hydrogen atom is -13.6 eV multiplied by (1/(n^2)), where n is the principal quantum number. But in positronium, because there are two particles, each effectively being in the same state.

Wait, in hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV * (1/(n^2)). For the ground state, n=1, so E is -13.6 eV. But positronium is like a two-electron system (well, same as a one-electron system with both particles), so each contributes equally.

Wait, but the energy for a two-body system (like two electrons) should be the same as the hydrogen's, because each electron is effectively in the same orbit. So the ground state energy for positronium should be the same as hydrogen's, right? So that would be -13.6 eV. But looking at the options, option F is -13.6 eV. But wait, wait, no. Wait, isn't the formula different when you have two particles? Or do they just effectively act like a single particle?

Wait, another approach: the energy of each particle in the positronium atom depends on their mutual Coulomb repulsion. The potential energy is (but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here) the potential between two positive charges (positron and electron) should be the same as the potential between a proton and electron.

Wait, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k_e * q1 * q2) / r. For a hydrogen-like atom, the ground state energy is -13.6 eV. But when you have two particles, each with charge e and mass m, the reduced mass comes into play.

Oh right! For two-body systems, the reduced mass μ is (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2). Since the electron and positron have the same mass, m1 = m2 = m_e. So μ = m_e^2/(2m_e) ) = m_e/2.

Wait, so the reduced mass is half of the electron mass. But since the electron and positron have the same mass, the reduced mass is (m_e * m_e) / (m_e + m_e) ) = m_e/2. So μ = m_e/2.

Then, the formula for the energy of a hydrogen-like atom is E_n = - (μ e^4) / (2 hbar^2 n^2) ) * (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) ? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to recall the formula using the reduced mass.

Wait, the standard formula for the energy levels in hydrogen-like atoms is E_n = - (μ e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 hbar^2) ) * (1/(n^2)).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. So the potential energy is related to the kinetic and potential energies. The total energy of the system is the sum, but for the ground state, perhaps each particle contributes to the potential energy.

Wait, but the potential energy between the two particles is U = (e^2)/(4πε0 r) * (1/2), because each has charge +e and -e, so the product is e^2. Wait, but if I'm considering the two particles, they each have a potential energy with each other. Or maybe the total potential energy is (e^2)/(4πε0 r), and that's the potential energy of the system. Because each contributes, but since the charges are opposite, each contributes half of the potential energy.

Wait, the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = (1/(4πε0)) * (q1 q2)/r. So for electron and positron, U = (e * e)/(4πε0 r) = (e²)/(4πε0 r). But wait, the kinetic energy of the system would then be considered as well. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, since we're being asked about the ground state energy, it's about the total energy, which includes kinetic and potential.

Wait, but in hydrogen-like atoms, the total energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. So for hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -(13.6 eV)/(n²). But for positronium, which is a hydrogen-like system with two particles, the energy is the same as Hydrogen's because each contributes their own potential and kinetic energies, but the total is the same as the single electron in a hydrogen atom.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the reduced mass. The correct approach is to calculate using the reduced mass. So let's do that.

The formula for the ground state energy (n=1) is E = - (μ e^4) / (8 ε0^2 hbar^2 ) * (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) ) * (1/(2 m_e)) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that the ground state energy for hydrogen is -13.6 eV, which is (1/2) the energy of a single particle. Because in hydrogen, the energy is E = -(μ e^4)/(8 ε0^2 hbar^2) * (1/(n²)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let's approach this systematically.

The formula for the ground state energy of a hydrogen-like atom is E = - (R_H * Z²) / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant, and n is the principal quantum number. But here, Z is 1 because it's a single proton and electron, but in this case, we have two particles, so does that change the Rydberg value?

Wait, no. The Rydberg constant R_H is a property of the vacuum and depends on fundamental constants. It's (m_e e^4)/(8 ε0^2 hbar^2 (4 π ε0)), I think. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the energy using the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ of the two particles (electron and positron) is (m_e * m_e)/(2 m_e) ) = m_e/2. So μ = m_e / 2.

Then the energy of the system is given by E = - (μ e^4)/(8 ε0^2 hbar^2) * (1/(n²)).

Wait, but wait, the Rydberg energy is E_R = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε0^2 hbar^2 (4 π ε0)) ) * (1/(4 π ε0)) ), but I might not remember the exact expression.

Alternatively, the ground state energy for hydrogen-like is E = - (m_e e^4)/(8 ε0^2 hbar^2) * (1/(n²)).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy using the formula for the energy levels in hydrogen-like atoms, using the reduced mass.

So, E_n = - ( (μ e^4 ) ) / (8 ε0^2 hbar^2) ) * (1/(4 pi ε0)) ) * (1/(n²)).

Wait, I'm not very confident. Let me think. The unit of energy is eV. So perhaps I can compute it another way.

The Coulomb potential energy between two particles of charge e and e separated by r is U = (e^2)/(4 π ε0 r).

For the ground state, the expectation value of r would be approximately the Bohr radius for hydrogen, which is (4 π ε0 hbar²)/(m_e e²).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy for the system is half that of a single electron in a hydrogen atom because the particles are identical.

Wait, another approach: the ground state energy for a single electron in hydrogen is -13.6 eV. Since there are two particles, each with mass m_e, but the system's energy is the same as that of a single particle if the particles are in the same orbit. So the ground state energy should be -13.6 eV. But that doesn't match any of the options except F, which is -13.6 eV.

But wait, the options include H and others. Let me look again.

Options:
A: -10.0 eV
B: -6.8
C: -5.4
D: -11.0 eV
E: -4.1 eV
F: -13.6 eV
G: -3.4 eV
H: -9.4 eV
I: -7.2 eV
J: -8.2 eV

So option F is -13.6 eV. So if my reasoning is correct, the energy would be -13.6 eV. So the answer would be F.

But wait, I'm not so sure because perhaps the reduced mass affects it. Let me compute using the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ = (m_e * m_e)/(m_e + m_e) ) = m_e/2.

The potential energy between the two particles is (e^2)/(4 π ε0 r ), and the kinetic energy is (μ v^2)/2, where v is the velocity of each particle.

In the Bohr model, the kinetic energy is (e^2)/(8 π ε0 r), and the potential is -(e^2)/(4 π ε0 r), giving a net energy of - (e^2)/(8 π ε0 r), which is -13.6 eV when r is the Bohr radius.

Wait, but with the reduced mass, maybe the energy is the same as in the hydrogen atom? Because the reduced mass affects the velocity, but perhaps the product of μ and e^2/(4 pi epsilon_0) gives the same as for the single electron.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reduced mass, so the energy would be E = -(μ e^4)/(8 ε0^2 hbar^2) * (1/(n²)).

But let's compute this. We know that for the Rydberg energy R_H = (m_e e^4)/(8 ε0^2 hbar^2 (4 pi ε0)) ) * (1/(4 pi ε0)) )? Not sure.

Alternatively, let me compute the energy using the reduced mass.

Given μ = m_e/2.

The Coulomb potential energy is U = (e^2)/(4 pi epsilon0 r), and the kinetic energy is (μ v^2)/2.

In the ground state, the kinetic energy is (1/2) μ v^2. But what's v in terms of the Bohr radius?

In the Bohr model, v = (e^2)/(4 pi epsilon0 r μ) ) * something. Wait, perhaps better to compute using the expression for energy.

The total energy is E = K + U = (1/2) μ v^2 - (e^2)/(4 pi epsilon0 r).

For the ground state, n=1, so E = - (e^2)/(8 epsilon0 r), where r is the Bohr radius.

Wait, but the Bohr radius for a single electron is a0 = (4 pi epsilon0 hbar^2)/(m_e e^2). So when we have two particles, what's the effective Bohr radius?

In the hydrogen atom, the Bohr radius is a0. For a system with reduced mass μ, the Bohr radius is a0' = a0 * (m_e)/(μ), since μ is less than m_e.

In our case, μ = m_e/2, so a0' = a0 * (m_e)/( (m_e/2) ) ) = 2 a0.

So the Bohr radius for positronium is twice that of hydrogen. So the potential energy would be U = (e^2)/(4 pi epsilon0 r) = (e^2)/(4 pi epsilon0 (2 a0)) ) = (e^2)/(8 pi epsilon0 a0).

But from hydrogen's formula, U = (e^2)/(4 pi epsilon0 a0), which is twice the potential energy in positronium's case.

Wait, but the energy of the ground state is E = - (13.6 eV) * n². So for n=1, E is -13.6 eV. But in this case, since the particles are in a system that's similar to a hydrogen atom, but with a different a0, perhaps the energy remains the same.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about it in terms of energy. The potential energy is (e^2)/(4 pi epsilon0 r) and the kinetic energy is (μ v^2)/2. The total energy is the sum, which for the ground state is -(13.6 eV) if we have the same n. But if the Bohr radius a0' is larger (twice as much), then the energy is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the formula for energy in a hydrogen-like atom. The energy levels are E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (Z²) / n². But in positronium, Z is 1, and n is 1. So E = -13.6 eV. Therefore, the correct answer should be F: -13.6 eV.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident because the reduced mass affects the energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the reduced mass.

Alternatively, another approach. The ground state energy can be calculated using the formula E = - ( (μ e^4) / (8 ε0^2 hbar^2) ) * (1/(n²)) ). 

Compute this. But perhaps I can compute it using known values.

The reduced mass μ = m_e / 2.

The Coulomb constant is k = e²/(4 pi epsilon0) = 8.988e9 N m²/C². But in terms of eV, perhaps it's better to compute using eV units.

Alternatively, the energy can be written as E = - (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon0^2 hbar^2) * (1/n^2).

Wait, that might be the case. Let me compute the value.

I know that the Rydberg energy is E = (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon0^2 hbar^2 (4 pi epsilon0)) ) * (1/(4 pi epsilon0)) ) ) * (1/(4 pi epsilon0)) )

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, I can think about the formula for the energy of hydrogen-like atoms in terms of the reduced mass.

Wait, another approach: in hydrogen, the energy is E = -13.6 eV for n=1. The ground state energy is E = -13.6 eV. But since positronium has a reduced mass of half, perhaps the energy is different. Or perhaps not, because the formula already accounts for the fact that the particles are identical and thus have a reduced mass.

Wait, no, the formula for the energy of hydrogen-like atoms already uses the reduced mass. So E = -13.6 eV in this case because μ is m_e/2, but the formula includes the reduced mass, so the energy remains the same as the hydrogen case.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of it another way. The potential energy between two charges is U = (e^2)/(4 pi epsilon0 r). The kinetic energy is K = (μ v^2)/2. The total energy is E = K + U.

In the Bohr model, the total energy is E = - (13.6 eV) * (1/n²). So for n=1, E = -13.6 eV.

But if the particles are in a system with a different a0, perhaps the energy remains the same. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is the same as hydrogen because the electrons are identical, so the formula uses the reduced mass, and the energy is the same as if it were a single particle.

Wait, but that can't be right, because the reduced mass affects the velocities, but perhaps the product μ e²/(4 pi epsilon0) is the same as the e²/(4 pi epsilon0) of a single particle? No, because μ is (m_e m_e)/(2 m_e) ) = m_e/2.

So μ e²/(4 pi epsilon0) = (m_e/2) * e²/(4 pi epsilon0) = (1/2) (m_e e²/(4 pi epsilon0)) ) = (1/2) (k_e), where k_e is Coulomb's constant? Wait, Coulomb's constant is k_e = e²/(4 pi epsilon0). So μ e²/(4 pi epsilon0) = (m_e/2) * k_e.

Wait, but in the energy formula, the energy E is (μ e^4)/(8 epsilon0^2 hbar^2) * (1/(n²)).

Let me compute that. 

E = (μ e^4)/(8 epsilon0^2 hbar^2) * (1/n²).

But substituting μ = m_e/2:

E = ( (m_e/2) e^4 )/(8 epsilon0^2 hbar^2) * (1/n^2).

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed with this. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy in terms of the Bohr radius.

The Bohr radius a0 is (4 pi epsilon0 hbar^2)/(m_e e²). So a0 = (hbar^2)/(m_e e² epsilon0) * (4 pi epsilon0) )

So a0 = ( hbar^2 (4 pi epsilon0) )/( m_e e² epsilon0 )) )

Wait, that's confusing. Let me compute a0 in terms of eV.

The formula for the Bohr radius in SI units is a0 = (4 π ε0 ħ²)/(m_e e²).

But converting that to eV, perhaps it's easier to compute using the Rydberg energy formula.

Wait, the Rydberg energy is E = (m_e e^4)/(8 epsilon0^2 hbar^2) ) * (1/(4 pi epsilon0)) ).

Wait, perhaps the formula for E_n is:

E_n = - ( (m_e e^2)^2 )/( (8 epsilon0^2 ħ^2) (4 pi epsilon0) ) ) * (1/(n^2)).

Hmm, perhaps this is getting me stuck. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the energy of a two-body system is the same as a single particle because of the way the formula is written.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me answer based on the standard formula for hydrogen-like atoms. Since in positronium, the particles are identical, the formula for the ground state energy remains the same as in hydrogen. Therefore, the energy is -13.6 eV.

So the correct answer is F: -13.6 eV.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the ground-state energy of a system consisting of a positron and an electron, analogous to a hydrogen atom. The key points to consider are:

1. **Identical Particles**: In a hydrogen-like atom, the ground-state energy is given by \( E = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \) for \( n = 1 \). For a system with two identical particles (e.g., positronium), the reduced mass \( \mu = \frac{m_e}{2} \) affects the energy calculation.

2. **Reduced Mass**: The formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom includes the reduced mass \( \mu \) as:
   \[
   E_n = -\frac{\mu e^4}{8 \varepsilon_0^2 \hbar^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n^2}.
   \]
   For the ground state (\( n = 1 \)), the energy depends on \( \mu \), but the formula inherently accounts for the reduced mass.

3. **Comparison with Hydrogen Atom**: The ground-state energy of a hydrogen atom is \( -13.6 \, \text{eV} \) for \( n = 1 \). For positronium, the particles are identical, and the formula for the ground-state energy remains the same as in hydrogen. Thus, the energy remains \( -13.6 \, \text{eV} \).

4. **Options Analysis**: Among the given options:
   - **Option F (-13.6 eV)**: Matches the calculated energy for positronium.
   - Other options do not correspond to the correct energy for this system.

Thus, the ground-state energy of the system is \( -13.6 \, \text{eV} \), corresponding to **Option F**.

ANSWER: F
