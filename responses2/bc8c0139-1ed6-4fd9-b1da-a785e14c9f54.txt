Okay, so I have this question about the effects of different mutations on mRNA and which would cause the most severe disadvantage. The question starts with the start codon and asks which change would most likely be the worst.

Hmm, I remember that the start codon is AUG in mRNA. When mutations occur, they can affect the protein synthesis. The key factors here are whether they're in the same codon or different codons, and where they are located.

So the options are A to J. Let's go through them.

Option A: Deletion of a nucleotide triplet. That would remove a codon. Like, if the triplet is deleted, the mRNA would have a truncated codon, so the protein would be shorter. But since it's a triplet, the effect is more severe than a single nucleotide.

Option B: Deletion of a nucleotide doublet. Wait, doublet? Or is that a typo? Because a nucleotide can't be double. Oh, maybe it's a deletion of a doublet of nucleotides? Like two triplets? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, perhaps it's a deletion of a codon (one nucleotide triplet) but presented as a doublet. Or maybe it's a double-deletion, like two triplets. But I think this might actually be a single codon. Alternatively, perhaps each option refers to a single nucleotide change, but sometimes the options are written in a way that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps each option's meaning is a single nucleotide change. Wait, the options are all about changes, but the wording is a bit tricky.

Wait, the question lists each option as a possible mutation. Option B says a deletion of a nucleotide doublet. Wait, a nucleotide can't be a doublet. Oh, maybe they meant a deletion of a codon with two nucleotides? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each option refers to a deletion of a triplet. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible effects.

Option C: multiple nucleotide substitution in the first, second, and third codon positions. So, each of the three codons has a substitution. That's a lot of changes. Each codon is a triplet, so a substitution in each would severely disrupt the first three amino acids.

Option D: single nucleotide insertion after the first codon position. So, an insertion in between the start codon and the first amino acid. That's a frameshift mutation, because inserting a nucleotide changes the reading frame. The subsequent codons would be wrong, leading to a premature stop codon and a truncated protein.

Option E: single nucleotide substitution at the first codon position. Wait, the first codon is AUG. If a single nucleotide is changed, the first amino acid (which is usually Val) would change. Could that cause a problem? Maybe, but perhaps not as severe as a frameshift or a premature stop.

Option F: double nucleotide substitution in first and second codon. So, two nucleotides in each codon. That would change the first two codons. That's a big change, possibly leading to a premature stop or a completely different protein.

Option G: deletion of a single nucleotide. That's a deletion of one triplet, so a codon is missing. So mRNA is truncated, leading to a shorter protein.

Option H: substitution of the third codon's nucleotide. So, the third codon is altered. That would change the amino acid corresponding to that codon.

Option I: deletion of a quadruplet of nucleotides. That's a deletion of a codon, same as option A. So mRNA is missing a codon, leading to a shorter protein.

Option J: single substitution in the second codon. So, the second codon's nucleotide is changed. That would alter the second amino acid, possible leading to a different one.

Now, the question is which change is the most deleterious. Let's rank the effects.

A and G and I are deletions of single nucleotides (triplets), so they cause a loss of a codon, leading to a shorter protein. But which one is worse? If it's a single nucleotide, the effect is more severe because it deletes a whole codon. Wait, but option A is a triplet—so deleting a triplet removes the entire codon, making the protein one nucleotide shorter. Similarly, G and I are single nucleotide deletions.

Between options A, G, I—what's worse? The deletion of a single nucleotide (G and I) would lead to a frameshift, which changes the reading frame and could result in a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. But a deletion of a triplet (A, G, I) would mean the mRNA is missing a codon, so the start codon is shifted. So a single nucleotide deletion would likely cause a frameshift and a shorter protein.

Wait, but a deletion of a triplet (like option A) would delete a codon. For example, if the mRNA is ...AUG..., and you delete the last triplet, it becomes ...AUG... without the last three. So the first amino acid is still present. It's a deletion, so the protein is shorter.

Now, comparing the options, A is a triplet deletion (which is a big deletion), G is a single nucleotide (which leads to a frameshift and truncation). But option G's effect would be a frameshift, which is worse because it changes the reading frame, leading to a wrong start codon and a premature stop. Whereas option A's deletion would make the protein shorter but not necessarily stop prematurely, but perhaps a frameshift would make it even shorter and the protein might not stop.

Wait, but the question is about the most deleterious effect. The most severe would be the insertion of a nucleotide, or a deletion of a codon. For example, a frameshift would cause the protein to be shorter and the reading frame to be wrong—so maybe a frameshift is more harmful. But sometimes, the effect of a single deletion (like option A) is just a shorter protein but the reading frame is correct. Whereas frameshift would change the reading frame.

Alternatively, a deletion of a single nucleotide (G) would cause a frameshift, which is a big change. So the first codon's amino acid would be wrong (like Val to something else), and the protein would be truncated, perhaps ending earlier.

So between A and G: if it's a single nucleotide deletion, the effect is worse because it's a frameshift, which changes the protein structure. But if it's a triplet deletion (A), just a shorter protein but correct reading frame.

Wait, but the options are about the consequences. So, which is more harmful? I think a frameshift (G) would lead to a shorter protein but potentially a different amino acid. But a triplet deletion (A) would lead to a shorter protein, but the reading frame is the same, so the protein is shorter but starts with the same amino acids.

The question is about the 'most deleterious effect.' So if a frameshift causes the protein to be shorter but the amino acids are different, that's bad. But if you delete a triplet, the protein is shorter but starts with correct amino acids.

So the worst effect would be a frameshift mutation, such as in option G, which is a single nucleotide substitution.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. In an mRNA, the start codon is AUG. So if the first nucleotide is changed (option J), that would change the first amino acid (e.g., Val becomes something else). But I thought option J is a substitution in the second codon. Wait, no, option J is a substitution in the second codon. So the second codon is changed, meaning the second amino acid is altered.

Wait, no, option J is a substitution in the second codon (position 2). So the first codon is the same, and the second codon is changed. So the first amino acid is the same, and the second is different.

Wait, let's think about each option:

Option A: deletion of triplet. mRNA is shorter, first codon missing. The protein is one nucleotide shorter. The reading frame is correct, so the protein is shorter but starts with the same amino acids. So the protein is shorter but still functional.

Option G: deletion of single nucleotide. mRNA is missing a codon. The reading frame is wrong. So the protein is truncated, and the amino acids would be wrong. This leads to a truncated protein, perhaps ending earlier than the normal case.

Option E: substitution in first codon. That would change the first amino acid (from Val to another), leading to a premature stop if that's the case.

Wait, in E, the substitution is in the first codon position. So the substitution is in the first nucleotide of the first codon. So the mRNA would have a different first nucleotide. For example, if the first codon was AUG, and the first nucleotide is changed to, say, ATG (but that's impossible because A is the start). Wait, no, wait, the first codon is AUG, so if the substitution is in the first nucleotide, it's like changing the first A to something else. But the first codon is the start, so any substitution would change the first amino acid. But if the substitution is in the first codon (like the first nucleotide), it's possible to cause a frameshift, leading to a truncated protein. But if the substitution is in the first codon, it's a single nucleotide substitution.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of each option:

Option G: a single nucleotide deletion—this is a frameshift. So the reading frame is messed up, leading to a truncated protein, perhaps. So the protein is shorter and the amino acids are wrong.

Option J: substitution in the second codon. So the second codon has a changed nucleotide. That would change the second amino acid. So the protein would be shorter by two amino acids (since the first is unchanged and the second is changed), perhaps leading to a premature stop. But in reality, the third codon could be altered as well, but the question only says the second codon is altered.

Wait, no. The second codon is altered. So the second amino acid is now different. But the start codon is the same (A). So the protein would still start with Val, but the second amino acid is changed. That's a possible effect. But how does that compare to a frameshift?

Alternatively, a frameshift would result in a much shorter protein (e.g., one amino acid fewer and a different one), which is more harmful than a substitution in the second codon, perhaps. Or not? It depends.

Alternatively, perhaps a frameshift (G) would cause the protein to be shorter and have a different reading frame, leading to a premature stop codon. So the protein would be shorter and the amino acids would be wrong.

Option E: substitution in first codon. Let's say the first codon was AUG. If the first nucleotide is changed, say to ATG, but that's not possible because the first codon starts with A. Alternatively, if the substitution is in the first nucleotide, like changing A to T, the mRNA would have T instead of A, so the first codon would be TGG (if the original was AGG?), wait no, original is AUG. Wait, no, the first codon is always AUG. So any substitution in the first codon would change that, leading to a different amino acid. So the protein would be shorter by one amino acid, and the first amino acid is changed. That's a possible effect.

Between G and E: a frameshift (G) leads to a truncated protein with the reading frame messed up. E changes the first amino acid, leading to a shorter protein but no reading frame shift.

Now, which effect is more severe? A frameshift results in the start codon being wrong (since the reading frame is wrong), leading to a premature stop codon. So the protein is shorter and the amino acids are wrong. This would be a more severe effect than a substitution in the second codon (J) or the first (E), which only changes the first amino acid.

So among the options, the worst would be a frameshift (G) or a triplet deletion (A)—wait, no, triplet deletion (A) is a shorter protein but correct frame. So G (frameshift) is worse because it changes the start codon and leads to a different protein.

Wait, but the question is about the most deleterious effect. So the most severe change would be a frameshift. So option G is the most deleterious.

Alternatively, option H: substitution of the third codon's nucleotide. So the third codon is altered. That would change the amino acid corresponding to the third codon. That's a moderate change, perhaps a major mutation but not as severe as a frameshift.

Option F: double substitution in first two codons. That's a big change, changing the first two codons—so the first two amino acids are altered. Maybe leading to a premature stop or a different amino acid. That's a serious mutation.

Wait, but the question is about the first codon's substitution, which is option J.

Wait, let me re-examine all options:

Looking for which mutation is the most harmful.

The most harmful would be a frameshift mutation (G), which shifts the reading frame, leading to a truncated protein and possibly a premature stop codon.

But in the options, which option is a frameshift? G is a single nucleotide deletion. So the mRNA has the first codon missing. That's a frameshift, but the reading frame is incorrect.

Wait, but if the first codon is missing, the mRNA is truncated at the first codon. So the protein is shorter. But the reading frame is correct — the rest of the protein is in the same reading frame, so the amino acids are correct beyond that point. So the protein is shorter, but the amino acids match.

Alternatively, a triplet deletion (A) would lead to a shorter protein with the correct reading frame.

So between options A and G, G's effect is more severe because the protein is shorter and the first amino acids are wrong.

Wait, but if you delete a triplet (option A), the mRNA is missing the first codon, so the protein is shorter by one amino acid. For example, if the mRNA is AUG followed by other codons, it's missing the first codon, so the protein starts at the next amino acid. So the protein is shorter, but the amino acids are still correct for the rest of the protein.

In contrast, a frameshift (G) would cause the reading frame to be wrong. So the first codon's amino acid is changed, and the rest are in a wrong frame. So the protein would be shorter and the amino acids are wrong beyond the first nucleotide.

So the effect of G is a much shorter protein with wrong amino acids, which is more harmful.

Alternatively, a substitution in the first codon (E) changes the first amino acid, but doesn't cause the reading frame to shift. So the protein is shorter by one amino acid, but the rest of the protein is in the same frame.

So the most deleterious is a frameshift (G) because it changes the amino acids early on and causes a premature stop.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

G: a single nucleotide deletion (triplet) => mRNA missing a codon.

So the mRNA is shorter, but the reading frame is correct. The protein is shorter but continues with the correct amino acids beyond that point.

Whereas option A is a triplet deletion. So the mRNA is missing a codon, but the reading frame is correct.

So, G's effect is a frameshift, which is worse.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of each change's effect.

Option G: mRNA has a codon missing. So the protein is shorter. But the reading frame is correct. So the first amino acids are the same as the rest. So the protein is shorter, but not leading to a frameshift.

Option A: mRNA missing a codon (triplet). So the protein is shorter, but the amino acids are correct because the reading frame is correct. So no frameshift.

So between G and A, G would cause a frameshift, leading to a shorter protein with wrong amino acids, which is more harmful.

So the worst change is option G.

Wait, but option J is a substitution in the second codon. So the second codon's nucleotide is changed. That would affect the second amino acid, making the protein shorter by two amino acids, perhaps.

But option G's effect is a frameshift, which would result in a shorter protein and a premature stop.

So the most deleterious is a frameshift mutation, which is option G.

Looking back at the options, option G is the correct answer.
</think>

To determine which mutation would have the greatest deleterious effect on mRNA, we need to analyze the options based on their impact on the protein's structure, sequence, and stability. The key factors to consider are frameshift mutations, premature stop codons, truncation, and altered amino acids.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: Deletion of a nucleotide triplet**  
   - This results in a completely missing codon, leading to a short mRNA. The protein is shorter, but the reading frame remains correct, so the amino acids are unchanged. This is a common mutation but does not cause a frameshift.

2. **Option B: Deletion of a nucleotide doublet**  
   - This is not a standard genetic mutation, as a nucleotide cannot be double. It is likely a typo, but it would still result in a short mRNA with a frameshift mutation.

3. **Option C: Multiple nucleotide substitution in the first, second, and third codon positions**  
   - This causes a frameshift mutation, altering the reading frame and potentially resulting in a premature stop codon. The protein is truncated, and the amino acids are incorrect.

4. **Option D: Single nucleotide insertion after the first codon position**  
   - This is a frameshift mutation, as it disrupts the reading frame. The protein is truncated, and the amino acids are incorrect.

5. **Option E: Single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position**  
   - This changes the first codon's nucleotide, altering the first amino acid. The protein is truncated by one amino acid, but the reading frame remains correct.

6. **Option F: Double nucleotide substitution in the first and second codon positions**  
   - This causes a frameshift mutation, altering the first two codons. The protein is truncated, and the amino acids are incorrect.

7. **Option G: Deletion of a single nucleotide**  
   - This results in a short mRNA with a frameshift mutation. The protein is truncated, and the amino acids are incorrect due to the altered reading frame. This is one of the most severe mutations.

8. **Option H: Substitution of the nucleotide in the third codon position**  
   - This changes the third codon's nucleotide, altering the third amino acid. The protein is truncated by two amino acids, but the reading frame remains correct.

9. **Option I: Deletion of a quadruplet of nucleotides**  
   - This is equivalent to a triplet deletion (Option A), resulting in a short mRNA with the correct reading frame. The protein is truncated but continues with the original amino acids.

10. **Option J: Substitution of the nucleotide in the second codon position**  
    - This changes the second codon's nucleotide, altering the second amino acid. The protein is truncated by two amino acids, but the reading frame remains correct.

### Conclusion:
The mutation with the greatest deleterious effect is **Option G: Deletion of a single nucleotide**. This results in a short mRNA with a frameshift mutation, truncating the protein and altering the amino acids beyond the first nucleotide. This is the most severe mutation among the options, as it causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.
