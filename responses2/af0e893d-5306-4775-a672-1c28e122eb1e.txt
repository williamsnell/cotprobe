Question:

The Extruded Plastics Company distributes overhead to each of its six departments according to the ratio of total overhead to the total direct labor costs. During January, the total overhead for the factory was $20,000; the total direct labor cost $140,000. Find the ratio to be applied to all departments. Then find the amount to be charged to the Quality Control Department whose direct labor costs for the month were $16,000.

Options:

A: $5,000
B: $2,285.71
C: $4,000
D: $4,285.71
E: $3,428.57
F: $1,142.86
G: $3,500
H: $1,000
I: $1,714.29
J: $2,857.14

Okay, so I have this problem about overhead allocation in a company, and I need to figure it out. Let me read the question again carefully.

The company distributes overhead to each department based on the ratio of total overhead to total direct labor costs. In January, the factory had $20,000 in total overhead and $140,000 in total direct labor. I need to find the ratio to apply to all departments. Then determine how much the Quality Control Department gets charged, which has $16,000 in direct labor costs.

Hmm, so the ratio for overhead allocation is probably overhead divided by direct labor. That makes sense because overhead is usually allocated based on some cost driver, which in this case is direct labor.

Wait, let me think: if the overhead is $20k, and the direct labor is $140k, the ratio might be 20k / 140k. Let me compute that. 20 divided by 140 is the same as 2/14, which simplifies to 1/7. So the ratio is 1:7. But wait, no, the question says the ratio is overhead to direct labor, so that's 20,000 / 140,000. Yeah, that's 1/7.

Wait, but the question says the ratio is applied to all departments. So the amount each department gets is (overhead ratio) multiplied by their direct labor costs. So the ratio is 1/7 per department.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the allocation is based on the ratio of total overhead to total direct labor. So the allocation rate is (Total Overhead)/(Total Direct Labor) per dollar of direct labor. So for each dollar of direct labor, the overhead allocated is (20000)/(140000) = 1/7. So the allocation rate is $1/7 per direct labor dollar.

So for each department, the overhead allocated is (direct labor cost) * (1/7).

So for the Quality Control Department, which has $16,000 in direct labor, the allocated overhead is 16,000 * (1/7) = 16,000 รท 7.

Let me calculate that. 16,000 divided by 7. Hmm, 7 goes into 16 once (7), remainder 9. Then 90 divided by 7 is about 12 (84), remainder 6. Then 60 divided by 7 is about 8 (56), remainder 4. Then 40 divided by 7 is about 5 (35), remainder 5. Then 50 divided by 7 is 7 (49), remainder 1. So it's approximately 2,285.71. Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

7 into 16 is 2.285714... So 16,000 /7 = 2,285.714285... So rounded to two decimal places, that's $2,285.71. Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The ratio is 20,000 overhead, 140,000 direct labor. So the allocation rate is 20,000 /140,000 = 1/7 per direct labor dollar. So each $1 of labor costs is allocated 1/7 of an overhead dollar. So for $16k, it's 16,000 * (1/7) = 2,285.71.

So the correct answer should be B, $2,285.71.

The ratio of overhead to direct labor costs is calculated as:

\[
\frac{\text{Total Overhead}}{\text{Total Direct Labor}} = \frac{20,000}{140,000} = \frac{1}{7}
\]

This ratio is applied to each department by multiplying the direct labor costs of the department by \(\frac{1}{7}\). For the Quality Control Department with direct labor costs of $16,000:

\[
\text{Overhead allocated} = 16,000 \times \frac{1}{7} = 2,285.71
\]

ANSWER: B
