Question:

Margaret's Toyland can sell x bags of marbles at a price of p cents per bag where p = 20 - 0.03x. If the cost of x bags is C = 3 + 0.02x, then how many bags will the store have to sell to maximize the profit?

Options:

A: 250 bags
B: 500 bags
C: 425 bags
D: 450 bags
E: 275 bags
F: 333 bags
G: 300 bags
H: 350 bags
I: 200 bags
J: 400 bags

Okay, so Margaret's Toyland wants to figure out how many bags of marbles they need to sell to maximize their profit. Hmm, profit is revenue minus cost, right? So I need to find the profit function and then find its maximum.

The price per bag is given by p = 20 - 0.03x. Wait, that's the price per bag when selling x bags. So the revenue R would be price multiplied by quantity, so R = p * x. Substituting p, that's R = (20 - 0.03x) * x. Let me write that down: R = 20x - 0.03x².

The cost C is given as 3 + 0.02x. So cost is straightforward; it's a linear function. So profit P is R minus C. So P = (20x - 0.03x²) - (3 + 0.02x). Let me compute that: P = 20x - 0.03x² - 3 - 0.02x. Combining like terms: 20x minus 0.02x is 19.98x, and the -0.03x² remains. So P = -0.03x² + 19.98x - 3.

Now, this is a quadratic equation. Since the coefficient of x² is negative (-0.03), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point. The x-coordinate of the vertex gives the x-value where the profit is maximized. The formula for the vertex is x = -b/(2a), where a is the coefficient of x², and b is the coefficient of x.

In this case, a = -0.03 and b = 19.98. Plugging into the formula: x = -19.98/(2 * -0.03). Let me calculate that. The denominator is 2*(-0.03) = -0.06. So x = -19.98 / -0.06. Dividing two negatives gives a positive. So 19.98 / 0.06.

Let me compute that division. 19.98 divided by 0.06. Maybe think of it as 19.98 * (1/0.06). 1/0.06 is approximately 16.6667. So 19.98 * 16.6667.

Alternatively, I can think of 19.98 divided by 0.06. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 1998 / 6. 6 goes into 1998 how many times? 6 * 333 = 1998. So it's 333.

Wait, so x = 333. So the maximum profit is achieved when selling 333 bags. Looking at the options, option F is 333 bags. So the answer should be F.

The profit function is derived from revenue minus cost. Revenue R is (20 - 0.03x)x, and cost C is 3 + 0.02x. Profit P = R - C = 20x - 0.03x² - 3 - 0.02x = -0.03x² + 19.98x - 3. The vertex of this parabola (opening downward) gives the maximum profit. Using x = -b/(2a) with a = -0.03 and b = 19.98, x = 333. Thus, the correct option is F.

Answer: F
