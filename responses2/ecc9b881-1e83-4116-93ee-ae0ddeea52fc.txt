Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about taxonomic ranks. Hmm, I need to figure out which is the highest level. Let me think about the options given: A through J. 

I remember that in biology, the taxonomic hierarchy goes from the smallest to the largest units. So starting from the most basic. The smallest unit is the species, right? Like, each individual with its own characteristics is a species. So the options I see are from that point up.

Looking at the options, E is Species. Then F is Phylum, which is above the family. G is Family. H is Class. I is Subspecies, which is a bit more specific than a species. J is Kingdom, which I think is the highest rank. Wait, but I thought Kingdom is the highest, and then came Phylum, then Class, Order, Family, etc., down to the lowest being species.

Wait, but is there a progression where Kingdom is the highest? Like, in some classifications, Kingdom is the last one, but is that correct? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me try to recall. The order of ranks is generally: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.

So the hierarchy starts from the broadest (Kingdom) to the most specific (species). So the highest is Kingdom. That would make J the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Sometimes in some classifications, the order might be slightly different, but I think the standard is that Kingdom is the highest.

So the options are:

E: Species
F: Phylum
G: Family
H: Class
I: Subspecies
J: Kingdom

So the highest is J: Kingdom. So the answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: Kingdom. The taxonomic hierarchy starts from the most general (Kingdom) to the most specific (species). 

Answer: J
