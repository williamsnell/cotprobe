Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the definition of overweight. The options are all different BMI ranges. Hmm, I remember that BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a way to assess someone's weight based on their height and weight. But wait, what exactly defines overweight?

I think the BMI formula is BMI = weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. So, a BMI of 22-26 might be the cutoff for normal weight, right? But wait, sometimes people define overweight differently. Some sources say that a BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight, while others might have different ranges. Oh wait, maybe the question is referring to a specific definition.

Looking at the options, option F says BMI 26-30 kg/m². That seems like a higher threshold. Option G is BMI 25-29.9 kg/m². So which one is correct?

I think the standard definition is that a BMI of 25 is the cutoff for overweight, but some sources might include higher numbers. Wait, I've also heard that some people use a BMI of 25 as the lower bound for overweight, and 30 as the upper for obesity. So maybe option G is the correct definition, considering that it's 25 to about 30 kg/m². 

Alternatively, option F is 26-30. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The common definition is BMI 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30+ is obesity. So option G would be correct if they're using that definition.

So the options are A to J. The correct definition is BMI 25-29.9 kg/m², which is option G.
