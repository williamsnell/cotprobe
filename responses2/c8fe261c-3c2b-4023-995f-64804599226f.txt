Okay, so I have this question about convolutional neural networks and convolutional filters. Hmm, I remember that convolutional layers process images by applying filters, which are like small matrices. The question is about how many filters are in the first layer of a CNN given the input and output dimensions.

The input is a color image of 28x28x3 pixels. So, each image is 28x28 pixels in size, and each pixel has 3 color channels (RGB). Then, the first layer's output tensor is 26x26x64. So, the output image is 26x26 pixels, but each channel now has 64 feature maps, I think.

Wait, how does that happen? Oh right, in the first convolutional layer, each filter applies to a 3x3 kernel, and the output size depends on the padding and the stride. But wait, I'm not sure if the stride is 1 here. Because the output size is 26x26, which is (28-2)/1 +1, right? Because for each dimension, the output size is (input size - kernel size) + padding divided by stride plus 1. If the stride is 1 and padding is 0, then (28-3) +1 = 26. So that makes sense.

Now, the output volume's dimension is 26x26x64. So each of the 26x26 positions has 64 feature maps. These feature maps are generated by convolving the input with multiple filters. Each filter in the first layer contributes to a specific feature, hence the 64.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find how many filters are in the first layer. Wait, no, the question is about the number of filters in the first layer. Hmm, wait no. Wait, no, each filter in the first layer contributes to the output. So the number of filters is the number of feature maps per position.

Wait, no. Wait, the number of feature maps per filter is 64? Or each filter produces 64 feature maps. Wait, no, each filter is one parameter. Wait, no, each filter is 3x3x3 (assuming RGB), but wait, in convolutional layers, the filters are 3D. So each filter is a 3x3x3 tensor. Wait, no, no. Wait, the filters are 3x3 in 2D and 1 in the third dimension (for RGB), so each filter is 3x3x1, but wait, the initial image has 3 color channels. So when you apply a filter, you're convolving each channel with the filter. So the number of feature maps per filter is equal to the number of filters, I think. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the number of filters in the first layer is the number of feature maps, which is 64. Because each filter contributes to a single feature map. So the output is 26x26x64, which is 26 rows, 26 columns, 64 filters. So the number of filters in the first layer is 64. But wait, the options have 64 as option D. But wait, isn't the number of filters equal to the number of feature maps across all the filters, but each individual filter is just one? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms.

Wait, no. The first layer's output is 26x26x64, which is 64 feature maps. Each feature map is generated by a single filter. So each filter is used for all 64 feature maps. So the number of filters in the first layer is 64. So the answer would be option D:64. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because each filter in the first layer produces one feature map. So if the output is 26x26x64, that means there are 64 feature maps, each of size 26x26. So each of the 64 feature maps is produced by a single filter. So the number of filters is 64. So the correct answer would be D, 64.

The question involves determining the number of filters in the first layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) given the input and output dimensions. The input image has a size of 28x28x3 pixels, and the output of the first layer is 26x26x64. Each filter in the first layer contributes to a feature map, and the number of feature maps per filter is equal to the number of filters. Therefore, the output dimension of 26x26x64 indicates that there are 64 feature maps in the first layer. Each feature map is generated by a single filter, so the number of filters is 64.

Answer: D
