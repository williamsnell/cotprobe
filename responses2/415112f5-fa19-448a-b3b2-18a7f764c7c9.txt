Okay, so I need to solve this flooring problem. Let me read it again carefully. The user just red redesigned their kitchen, changing the floor dimensions from 7'6" by 11'8". They want to cover the floor with linoleum that sells for $1.79 per running foot, in 6' width. The question is, what's the best way to cover the floor, and how much will it cost? The options are A to J, with varying costs from about $20 to $48.

Hmm, first, I should figure out the area of the kitchen floor. The dimensions are given in feet and inches, so I need to convert them to all feet or all inches to make calculations easier. Let's convert the inches to feet.

Starting with 7 feet 6 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 6 inches is 0.5 feet. So 7.5 feet.

Next, 11 feet 8 inches. 8 inches is 8/12, which is 2/3 or approximately 0.6667 feet. So 11.6667 feet.

Now, the area is length multiplied by width. So 7.5 ft multiplied by 11.6667 ft. Let me calculate that. 

7.5 * 11.6667... Hmm. 7 * 11 is 77, 7 * 0.6667 is about 4.6669. 0.5 * 11 is 5.5 and 0.5 * 0.6667 is about 0.3333. Adding all these together: 77 + 4.6669 = 81.6669, plus 5.5 is 87.1669, plus 0.3333 is 87.5. So approximately 87.5 square feet.

Wait, another way to calculate it: 7.5 * 11.6667. Let me do the multiplication more accurately. 

11.6667 is 11 and 2/3. So 7.5 * (11 + 2/3) = 7.5*11 + 7.5*(2/3) = 82.5 + 5 = 87.5. Yep, same result. So area is 87.5 sq ft.

Now, the linoleum is sold in 6' width. I need to figure out how much running foot they need. Running foot is the length of the roll, so it's the area divided by the width. The width is 6 feet.

So running feet needed = 87.5 / 6 ≈ 14.5833 running feet.

But linoleum is sold by the running foot, so the customer needs to buy the next whole number if they can't buy a fraction. Alternatively, sometimes they can buy partial runs, but the options might require exact calculation.

Wait, wait, no, the question is about covering the entire floor. So if you need 14.58 running feet, you'd need to buy 15 running feet since you can't have a fraction if you're buying in 6-foot widths. But perhaps the store sells in 6-foot widths, so you need to calculate how many runs are needed.

Wait, no. The linoleum is sold in 6' width, but the way it's sold is in running foot. So the roll is 6 feet wide, and the length is the running foot. So for example, a 6' width running foot roll is 6 feet long. So to cover 87.5 square feet, you'd need 87.5 / 6 ≈ 14.5833 running feet. Since you can't buy a fraction, you'd need to buy 15 running feet. However, some stores might round up to the next foot. But perhaps the question is considering that 15 running feet would be enough, so the area is 87.5 sq ft, and you need 15 running feet.

Wait, no, wait again: running foot is the length of the roll. So if you need 14.5833 running feet, you can't buy 14.5833, so you have to buy 15 running feet. Alternatively, sometimes it's possible to buy in 6' widths, so 15 running feet would be 15 * 6 = 90 square feet, which is more than needed. But wait, that seems excessive. Alternatively, maybe the store sells rolls in 6-foot widths, so each 6-foot roll is 6 feet wide and L feet long. If you have a 15 running foot needed, you'd buy one 15-foot roll, which is 15 *6=90 sq ft. But that's more than necessary. Alternatively, you might buy 15 running feet, but sometimes the store doesn't round up, they just want to cover the area. So perhaps you need to calculate how many 6-foot wide rolls are needed to cover 87.5 sq ft.

Wait, actually, the formula is area = length × width. So the length (running foot) of each roll is, for a 6-foot width: length = area / width. So area is 87.5, width is 6, so 87.5 / 6 ≈14.5833 running feet. So you need about 14.5833 running feet. So you can't buy a fraction, so you have to buy 15 running feet. But wait, each roll is 6' wide, so the length is how much you need. Each roll is 6 feet wide, and the length is the running foot. So 15 running feet would be 15 *6 = 90 sq ft, but wait, that's more than needed. Alternatively, perhaps the store sells rolls in increments, like 6', 12', etc. So if 14.5833 running feet is needed, you'd need to buy 15 running feet, but the question is whether the store rounds up or not. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the 6-foot width is the width of the roll, so the length is the running foot. So for example, if you need 14.5833 running feet, you need to buy 15 running feet (since you can't have 0.5833 of a roll). So you'd need one 15-foot running foot roll, which is 15 *6=90 sq ft. But wait, that's way more than the area needed. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it. The area is 87.5 sq ft. Each running foot roll is 6 feet wide. So the length of the roll needed is 87.5 /6 ≈14.5833 running feet. So you can't buy a fraction, so you have to round up to the next whole number. So 15 running feet. Each running foot is 6 feet. So 15 *6 =90 square feet. Wait, but that's just the area of the roll. The area of the floor is 87.5, so buying 90 would be more than needed. But the question is, what is the best way to cover the floor. So maybe the store sells in 6' wide, so you have to buy the minimum number of rolls that can cover the area.

Wait, perhaps the question is that each roll is 6 feet wide and L feet long, so one roll is 6L square feet. So to cover 87.5, you need 87.5 / (6L) where L is the length of the roll. Wait, no, that's getting confusing. Let me think differently.

The total running feet needed is 14.5833. So you have to buy 15 running feet. Each running foot is 6 feet, so the length of the roll is 15 feet. So the area of the roll is 15 *6 =90 sq ft. But the floor is 87.5, so buying 90 is more than enough. But the question is about the cost. So the cost is 15 running feet times $1.79 per running foot.

So 15 *1.79 = ?

Let me calculate that: 10*1.79=17.90, 5*1.79=8.95. So 17.90 + 8.95=26.85. So the total cost is $26.85, which is option B. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because the question says "cover the floor" — if you can't buy a fraction, you'd have to buy 15 running feet, which would cost $26.85. So the answer would be B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects you to calculate the square footage and then divide by the width of each roll. Wait, let me confirm the formula again. The area of the floor is 87.5 sq ft. Each running foot roll is 6 ft wide. So the length of each roll (running foot) is 87.5 /6 ≈14.5833. Since you can't buy a fraction, you have to buy 15 running feet. Each running foot is 6 ft, so 15 *6=90 sq ft. But that's 90, which is more than needed. But the question says "cover the floor". So perhaps the store allows you to buy partial runs, but the cost is based on the required running feet. Alternatively, maybe the store sells 6-foot width rolls, and you need 15 running feet, which would be one 15-foot roll. So the cost is 15 *1.79= $26.85, which is option B.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question is considering the area in terms of the 6' width. So, the area of the floor is 87.5. Each 6' wide running foot roll is 6 feet long. So the area covered by one roll is 6 * L, where L is the length. But no, that's not how it's set up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the roll is 6 feet wide and L feet long. So each running foot is 1 foot long, so a running foot is 6 feet in length. So each running foot roll is 6ft wide and 1ft long, so the area is 6*1=6 sq ft per running foot. So to cover 87.5 sq ft, you need 87.5 /6 ≈14.5833 running feet. So you can't buy a fraction, so you have to buy 15 running feet. So the cost is 15 *1.79=26.85, which is option B.

But wait, another way: maybe the roll is 6 feet wide and the length is the running feet. So the area of one running foot is 6*1=6. So to cover 87.5, you need 87.5 /6 ≈14.5833 running feet. So you need 15 running feet. So cost is 15 *1.79=26.85, which is option B.

Alternatively, maybe the store sells in 6-foot wide rolls, and you can buy the minimum number of runs that, when multiplied by 6, covers the area. So 87.5 /6 ≈14.5833. So you have to buy 15 runs, so 15*6=90 sq ft. But that would be overbuying. But the question says "cover the floor", so perhaps it's enough to cover, not necessarily exactly. So the cost is 15 runs at 1.79 each.

So the total cost is 15 *1.79=26.85, which is option B.

Looking at the options, option B is $26.85. So the correct answer should be B.

The kitchen floor measures 7'6" (7.5 ft) by 11'8" (11.6667 ft), giving an area of 87.5 square feet. The linoleum sells in 6' width rolls, each providing 6 feet of running length. To cover the area, you need 87.5 / 6 ≈ 14.5833 running feet. Since you can't purchase a fraction, you round up to 15 running feet. Each running foot costs $1.79, so the total cost is 15 * $1.79 = $26.85.
