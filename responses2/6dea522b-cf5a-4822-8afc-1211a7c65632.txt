Question:

Stock A has a beta of 0.8, while Stock B has a beta of 1.4. The expected return on the market is 10% and the risk-free rate is 7%. Using CAPM and this stock information, what is the required rate of return for Stocks A and B, respectively?

Options:

A: −2.6% and 4.9%
B: 5.4% and 9.5%
C: 9.4% and 11.2%
D: 6.4% and 10.5%
E: 4.3% and 7.4%
F: 11.4% and 14.2%
G: 10.4% and 13.2%
H: 6.7% and 11.3%
I: 7.2% and 10.1%
J: 8.1% and 12.6%

Okay, so I've got this CAPM question in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what CAPM stands for. Hmm, Capital Asset Pricing Model. Right, CAPM is a model that determines the expected return of a financial asset. It relates the expected return of an asset to its beta, which measures its volatility compared to the market.

The question gives me the betas of two stocks, A and B. Beta of 0.8 for A and 1.4 for B. The expected return on the market is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 7%. I need to find the required rate of return for each stock using CAPM.

I remember the formula for CAPM is: Required Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). So, R = Rf + β*(Rm - Rf).

Let me calculate for Stock A first. Beta is 0.8. So the calculation would be 7% + 0.8*(10% -7%). Wait, 10% minus 7% is 3%, multiplied by 0.8 is 2.4%. Adding 7% gives 9.4%. So A's required return is 9.4%? Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option C has 9.4% and 11.2%. Option H is 6.7% and 11.3%, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, option C is correct for A.

Now for Stock B, beta is 1.4. So it's 7% +1.4*(10-7) = 7% +1.4*3% = 7% +4.2% = 11.2%. So Stock B requires 11.2% return. Now looking at the options, option C says A:9.4% and B:11.2%. But wait, option C's B is 11.2? Let me check the options again.

Wait, all the options are given with pairs. Let me see the options. Oh, option C is 9.4% and 11.2%, which matches what I calculated. So the answer should be option C. But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Alternative approach: 10% is the market return, 7% is Rf.

For A: 0.8*(3%) = 2.4%. So 7% +2.4% =9.4%. For B: 1.4*3% =4.2%, 7%+4.2=11.2%. So option C is correct. But looking at the options, option C is the first one. So the answer should be option C.

The required rate of return for Stock A is calculated as follows:  
**CAPM Formula**:  
\[ \text{Required Return} = \text{Rf} + \beta \times (\text{Rm} - \text{Rf}) \]  

For Stock A (β = 0.8):  
\[ \text{Required Return} = 7\% + 0.8 \times (10\% - 7\%) = 7\% + 0.8 \times 3\% = 7\% + 2.4\% = 9.4\% \]  

For Stock B (β = 1.4):  
\[ \text{Required Return} = 7\% + 1.4 \times (10\% - 7\%) = 7\% + 1.4 \times 3\% = 7\% + 4.2\% = 11.2\% \]  

Thus, the required returns are **9.4% for Stock A and 11.2% for Stock B**. Among the options, this corresponds to **option C**.
