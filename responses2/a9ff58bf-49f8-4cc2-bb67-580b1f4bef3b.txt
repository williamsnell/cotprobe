Question:

A large island is devastated by a volcanic eruption. Most of the horses die except for the heaviest males and heaviest females of the group. They survive, reproduce, and perpetuate the population. Since weight is highly heritable and the distribution of weights approximates a binomial distribution, the offspring of the next generation would be expected to have

Options:

A: a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population
B: the same mean weight as members of the original population
C: a lower mean weight compared with their parents
D: the same mean weight as their parents
E: a lower mean weight compared with members of the original population
F: a greater range of weights compared to the original population
G: a weight distribution skewed towards lighter weights

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about genetics and evolution, specifically related to volcanic eruptions and the effects on horse populations. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question says that a large island is destroyed by a volcanic eruption, and most of the horses die except for the heaviest males and heaviest females. These survivors manage to reproduce and perpetuate the population. The key points here are about the heritability of weight and how weight distribution changes from one generation to the next.

Weight is highly heritable, which I remember from biology. So, traits like weight can be passed down from parents to offspring because parents are genetically related. Also, the distribution of weights approximates a binomial distribution, which I think refers to the fact that each horse's weight is a combination of inherited and possibly environmental factors, but here it's more about genetic factors.

So, in the original population, most horses are lighter, except for a few heaviest males and females. Those survivors carry the highest weight. When they reproduce, they'll pass on their weights to their offspring.

Wait, in a typical scenario, if parents have high weights, their offspring would also have high weights, right? Unless there's some environmental or other factors that reduce it. But here, the question says weight is highly heritable, so the offspring should have a similar or higher mean weight compared to the parents.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. If parents are all heavy, their offspring should also tend to be heavy. So, in this case, the survivors (males and females) are the heaviest. So when they reproduce, their offspring would inherit those heavy weights. So the mean weight in the next generation would be higher than the parents.

But wait, there's another consideration here. Because the original population has a few heavy individuals, but the majority are light. When they reproduce, the mean would be influenced more by the heavier individuals. So the mean of the offspring group would be higher than the mean of the parents.

Wait, let me think again. The original population has a mean that's higher than the light horses, because the heavy males and females are present. The mean of the survivors would be higher than the average of the lighter horses. But when they reproduce, the offspring inherit their parental weights. So the mean of the offspring should be higher than the parents.

Wait, but I might be mixing things up. Let me step back. The original population's mean weight is higher because of the heavy males and females. The parents (males and females) have a mean that's higher than the lighter ones. So when they produce offspring, the offspring's mean would be higher than the parents.

So the next generation's offspring would have a higher mean weight than the parents. That would point to option A. Let me double-check the options.

Options:

A: higher mean weight compared with members of the original population.

B: same as original.

C: lower than parents.

D: same as parents.

E: lower than original (unlikely, since parents are heavier)

F: greater range (so more variation, maybe but the mean is higher)

G: skewed towards lighter (maybe if parents were lighter, but parents are heavier)

So yes, the offspring should have a higher mean. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember some heritable traits might be subject to environmental factors that could lower them, but the question says weight is heritable, so it's more likely to be passed on.

Alternatively, maybe the environment affects the offspring, but the question states that weight is highly heritable. So it's about genetic inheritance, not environmental. So the offspring should have a mean equal or higher than parents.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let's think about the concept of heritability. High heritability means that a trait is passed on genetically. So since the parents are heavy, their offspring should be heavy. Therefore, the mean of the offspring should be higher than the parents.

Wait, but the parents (males and females) are the heaviest. So the offspring would have a mean higher than the parents. So the next generation would have a higher mean weight than the parents.

But wait, the original population's mean is higher than the lighter horses because of the heavy males and females. So the parents' mean is higher than the overall population. Then, the offspring mean is higher than the parents. So the offspring have a higher mean than the parents, which are higher than the original population. So the offspring have a higher mean than the original population. That would make option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the parents' mean is higher than the original's, so the offspring mean is higher than the parents. So yes, higher than the original.

So the answer should be A.

The question involves a scenario where a large island is devastated by a volcanic eruption, killing most horses except for the heaviest males and females. These survivors, known as heaviest males and heaviest females, reproduce and perpetuate the population. The distribution of weights approximates a binomial distribution, and weight is highly heritable. The task is to determine how the mean weight of the offspring compares to the original population.

Weight heritability implies that traits like weight are passed down genetically. The survivors (males and females) have the highest weights, which are inherited by their offspring. Since the parents (males and females) are the heaviest, their offspring inherit these heavy weights, leading to an **increased mean weight** in the next generation compared to the parents. The parents themselves have a mean weight higher than the lighter horses, and the offspring inherit this higher mean.

Considering the options:
- **A**: A higher mean weight compared with members of the original population. This is correct because the offspring inherit the heavy weights of the parents.
- **B**: The same mean weight as members of the original population. Incorrect, as offspring have a higher mean.
- **C**: A lower mean weight compared with their parents. Incorrect, as offspring have a higher mean.
- **D**: The same mean weight as their parents. Incorrect, as offspring have a higher mean.
- **E**: A lower mean weight compared with members of the original population. Incorrect, as the parents are already heavier than the original population.
- **F**: A greater range of weights compared to the original population. Incorrect, as the question focuses on mean weight, not range.
- **G**: A weight distribution skewed towards lighter weights. Incorrect, as the offspring inherit the heavy weights of their parents.

The correct answer is **A**, as the offspring have a higher mean weight than the parents, who themselves have a higher mean weight than the original population.
