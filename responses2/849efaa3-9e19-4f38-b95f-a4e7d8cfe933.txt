Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about trade discount. The question says that the list price is $4.95 and the net price is $2.95. I need to find the trade discount amount. Hmm, I remember that the trade discount is the difference between the list price and the net price. So, I should subtract the net price from the list price.

Let me write that down: Trade Discount = List Price - Net Price. Plugging in the numbers, that's 4.95 minus 2.95. Let me do the subtraction. 4.95 minus 2.95. Well, 4 minus 2 is 2, and 0.95 minus 0.95 is 0. So, the trade discount should be $2.00. Looking at the options, option I is $2.00. So I think the answer is option I.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes when dealing with money, small errors can happen. Let me add it back. If the list price is $4.95 and the discount is $2.00, then the net price should be 4.95 - 2.00 = 2.95. Yep, that matches. So the trade discount is indeed $2.00.

The trade discount is the difference between the list price and the net price.

**Trade Discount = List Price - Net Price**
**Trade Discount = $4.95 - $2.95 = $2.00**

**Answer: I: $2.00**

Answer: I
