Okay, so I've got this question about root mean square speed. Hmm, I remember that the rms speed depends on the molar mass of the gas. Wait, the formula is something like sqrt(3RT/M), right? Oh right, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. So the higher the molar mass, the lower the rms speed.

The question says the rms speed of H₂ is 1600 m/s. And they're asking about O₂'s speed at the same temperature. So I need to find the ratio between the rms speeds of O₂ and H₂.

Wait, let's think about the molar masses. Hydrogen has a molar mass of about 2 g/mol, O₂ is 32 g/mol. So the molar mass is 16 times higher for O₂ compared to H₂. Since rms speed is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass, the ratio would be sqrt( (M_H) / (M_O₂) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The rms speed is proportional to sqrt(1/M). So v_rms ∝ 1/sqrt(M).

So if M_O₂ is 16 times M_H₂, then v_O₂ = v_H₂ * sqrt(M_H2 / M_O2). So that's 1600 * sqrt(2/32). Simplify 2/32 is 1/16, so sqrt(1/16) is 1/4. So 1600 * (1/4) is 400 m/s.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Oh right, the formula is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M). So when M increases, v decreases. So for O₂, M is 32 g/mol, which is 16 times H₂'s M. So v_H is 1600. v_O would be 1600 * sqrt( (32)/(2) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. It's v_rms ∝ 1/sqrt(M). So if M increases, v decreases.

So M_O₂ = 32, M_H₂ = 2. The ratio is M_H₂ / M_O₂ = 2/32 = 1/16. So the ratio of v's is v_O / v_H = sqrt( (M_H₂)/(M_O₂) ) = sqrt(1/16) = 1/4. So v_O = v_H * (1/4) = 1600 * 0.25 = 400 m/s.

So the answer should be 400 m/s. Looking at the options, that's option A:400. So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, none of the options after A is 400. Let me check the options again. The options are A to J. So option A is 400. So the correct answer is A.

The root mean square (rms) speed of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass, according to the formula \( v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} \). For hydrogen (\( \text{H}_2 \)) and oxygen (\( \text{O}_2 \)) at the same temperature, the molar masses are \( M_{\text{H}_2} = 2 \, \text{g/mol} \) and \( M_{\text{O}_2} = 32 \, \text{g/mol} \), respectively. The ratio of their rms speeds is given by:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{rms, O}_2}}{v_{\text{rms, H}_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{H}_2}}{M_{\text{O}_2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{32}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{16}} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Given that \( v_{\text{rms, H}_2} = 1600 \, \text{m/s} \), the rms speed of \( \text{O}_2 \) is:

\[
v_{\text{rms, O}_2} = 1600 \times \frac{1}{4} = 400 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **400 m/s**, corresponding to option **A**.
