Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question presents two statements about groups of order 42 and whether they have certain normal subgroups. The options are A to J, each with a combination of truth values for the two statements.

First, let me understand the question. Statement 1 says every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7. Statement 2 says every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8. I need to determine if each statement is true or not.

I remember that in group theory, the existence of normal subgroups is related to the structure of the group. For a group of order n, it must have a normal subgroup of order d if d divides n, provided that the group satisfies certain conditions.

Wait, but for these statements, the orders are 7 and 8. Let me think about the possible group structures of order 42 first. The order is 42, which factors into 2 * 3 * 7. So the possible group structures are limited based on the Sylow theorems.

Sylow theorems tell us about the number of Sylow p-subgroups. For a group of order 42, which is 2*3*7, let's consider the Sylow 7-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 2-subgroups.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering that the group of order 42 is isomorphic to the cyclic group C42, or perhaps some other group like the dihedral group, or maybe a semidirect product of these cyclic groups.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that a group of order 42 is solvable. Because 42 is the product of distinct primes (2, 3, 7), and any group with order pqr where p, q, r are distinct primes is solvable.

Wait, but even more specifically, the Sylow subgroups in a group of order 42 would have orders 2, 3, and 7. Hmm.

Now, for statement 1: every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.

I think Sylow 7-subgroups are of order 7. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n7, must divide 6 (since 42/7=6) and be congruent to 1 mod 7. The possible values of n7 are 1 and 6. If n7=1, then the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal. Similarly, if n7=6, then there are 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, none of which are normal.

But wait, in a group of order 42, are there groups where the Sylow 7-subgroups are not normal? For example, if n7=6, then the Sylow 3-subgroups would have some properties.

Wait, let me think about the Sylow 3-subgroups. The order is 3, so they have order 3. The number of Sylow 3-subgroups, n3, divides 14 and is 1 mod 3. So possible n3=1 or 4 or 14?

Wait, 14 is possible. Let's see, 14 is 1 mod 3? 14 mod3 is 2. Oh, wait, 14 is not 1 mod3. 14 divided by 3 is 4 with remainder 2. So 14 is 2 mod3. So that's not possible. So possible n3 values are 1 and 4. Wait, 4 is 1 mod3? 4 mod3 is 1. Yes. So n3 could be 1 or 4.

Hmm. So if n3=1, then the Sylow 3-subgroup is normal. If n3=4, then there are 4 Sylow 3-subgroups. Similarly, for n7=1, the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal.

Wait, but I think in a group of order 42, the Sylow subgroups can sometimes be normal. But does that mean that for each group, the Sylow subgroups are normal in some cases?

Wait, but the question is about whether every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7. So if in any group of order 42, there's always at least one normal subgroup of order 7, then statement 1 is true.

Wait, but is it possible for a group of order 42 to not have a normal Sylow 7-subgroup? Because if that's possible, then statement 1 would be false.

Wait, let's think about the structure of a group of order 42. Since 42 is 2*3*7, it's a solvable group, so it has a normal subgroup. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the Sylow 7-subgroup is of order 7. Let's see, 7 is prime, so the Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic, hence normal in its own Sylow series. But whether it's normal in the entire group depends on the number of Sylow 7-subgroups.

If n7=1, then the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal in the group. If n7=6, then it's not normal. So for a group of order 42, it's possible that n7=6, so the Sylow 7-subgroups are not normal.

Wait, but wait! I think all groups of order 42 are solvable, but does that imply anything about the Sylow subgroups? Or is it possible for a group of order 42 to have Sylow 7-subgroups that are not normal?

Hmm, yes, perhaps. For example, in the case where n7=6, the Sylow 7-subgroups are not normal. So the group of order 42 may not have a normal Sylow 7-subgroup.

Wait, but statement 1 says every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7. If in some group of order 42, the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal, then statement 1 would be false.

So, can such a group exist? Let me try to construct one or determine if it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Wait, perhaps all groups of order 42 have a normal Sylow 7-subgroup. Let me think again.

Wait, the Sylow 7-subgroups have order 7. Since 7 is prime, each Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic, hence normal in itself. But whether it's normal in the larger group depends on the number of Sylow 7-subgroups.

If n7=1, then it's normal. If n7=6, then there are 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, none of which are normal.

So, does a group of order 42 necessarily have a normal Sylow 7-subgroup?

Wait, I think that's not the case. Let me think of the dihedral group D_21 (which has order 42). D_21 is the dihedral group of order 42, which has a normal subgroup of order 21 (the cyclic subgroup generated by a rotation). But does D_21 have a normal Sylow 7-subgroup?

Wait, the dihedral group D_n has a normal subgroup of order 2, which is the cyclic subgroup generated by a rotation of order 2. But are there any Sylow 7-subgroups? Well, in D_21, the rotations form a cyclic group of order 21, which is prime? No, 21 is not prime. Wait, D_21 is a dihedral group of order 42, which is 2*3*7.

The dihedral group D_n has order 2n. So in this case, n=21, so the rotations form a cyclic group of order 21, which has a subgroup of order 7, which is cyclic. So that Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic and hence normal in the cyclic rotation subgroup. But is this Sylow 7-subgroup normal in the entire dihedral group?

Wait, in D_n, the dihedral group, the rotation subgroup (which is cyclic of order n) is normal. So any subgroup of this rotation subgroup would also be normal in D_n. So in D_21, the cyclic subgroup of order 7 is normal. So in that case, statement 1 would be true, because there's a normal subgroup of order 7.

Wait, but that's only in the dihedral group. Are there other groups of order 42 where the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal?

Wait, perhaps another group structure. Let me think of another group of order 42. For example, the alternating group A_7? Wait, no, A_7 is of order 7! / 2, which is much larger than 42. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps all groups of order 42 have a normal Sylow 7-subgroup. Let's double-check.

Wait, the Sylow 7-subgroups have order 7. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n7, divides 6 and is congruent to 1 mod7. So possible n7 is 1 or 6. If n7=1, then it's normal. If n7=6, then it's not normal.

But wait, can n7=6 in a group of order 42? Let me think. For example, take the cyclic group C_42. Its Sylow 7-subgroup is unique, so it's normal. But what about the dihedral group D_21? Its Sylow 7-subgroup is of order 7, and since the rotation subgroup is cyclic of order 21, the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal in D_21.

Wait, what about the direct product of C_3 and C_14? No, wait, 3 and 14 are coprime, so that's not the case. Maybe another group.

Wait, perhaps the group is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 7 and a cyclic group of order 6, making it cyclic of order 42. So in that case, the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal.

Wait, but maybe there's a non-abelian group of order 42. Let me think, 42=2*3*7. So a non-abelian group of order 42 would be a semidirect product of the Sylow subgroups.

Wait, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups in such a group would be 1 or 6. But perhaps in some cases, n7=6, and the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal.

Wait, but if n7=6, then the number of Sylow 7-subgroups is 6. Since each Sylow 7-subgroup is of order 7, and 6*7=42, which is the group order. So 6 Sylow 7-subgroups.

But then, if there are 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of order 7, and they all intersect trivially, but wait, in a group of order 42, the Sylow 7-subgroups would have to intersect only at the identity, since their orders are coprime.

So, if 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of size 7, their total number is 6*7=42, so they must partition the group. But wait, 6 Sylow 7-subgroups each of size 7, so 6*7=42. So each Sylow 7-subgroup would have to be the entire group, but that's impossible because the group has more elements than 7. Wait, no. Wait, each Sylow 7-subgroup has 7 elements, including the identity. So, 6 Sylow 7-subgroups would contribute 7*6=42 elements, but that's all of the group. So the group would be the union of all Sylow 7-subgroups. But each Sylow 7-subgroup is of order 7, and they all intersect at the identity. So the group is their join, which is the entire group.

But in that case, each Sylow 7-subgroup is a maximal subgroup. But if n7=6, then the group would have 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of order 7, and each of the Sylow 3-subgroups would have to have n3=1, because 42/(7*6) isn't possible. Wait, no. Wait, n3 would have to divide 14 (since 42/3=14) and be 1 mod3. 14 mod3 is 2, which is not 1, so n3 can be 1 or 4. But if n7=6, then the group's structure would be such that the Sylow 3-subgroups are not all normal.

But wait, in the case of n7=6, the group has 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of order 7. Each Sylow 7-subgroup's normalizer would be the group itself, perhaps. So in that case, the group of order 42 would have 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of order 7, and the group is their union.

In that case, the group would have 6*(7-1) =36 elements of order 7. But the group is of order 42, so 6 elements are the identity, 36 of order 7, and remaining 6 elements would be of order 3 or 14 or 6. Wait, because 6 divides 42, but 6 is 2*3.

Wait, 42 = 6 *7. So the remaining elements (after Sylow 7 and Sylow 3 subgroups) would have to account for the rest.

But perhaps that's not the right way to think about it. The key point is whether having n7=6 is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps a group of order 42 can't have 6 Sylow 7-subgroups because that would require 6*(7-1)=36 elements of order 7, but 42 is 6*7, so the group would have 6 elements of order 7, which is possible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to find if such a group exists. Maybe the group is the direct product of a Sylow 7-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup, but that would be C7 × C3, which is cyclic of order 21, not 42. That can't be right.

Wait, no, the order would be 7*3=21, which is too small. So perhaps the group isn't a direct product.

Wait, perhaps the group is the dihedral group D_21, which has order 42. In D_21, the Sylow 7-subgroup is the cyclic subgroup of order 7. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups in D_21 is 1, because the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal in the rotation subgroup, and since D_21 has a normal subgroup of order 21, the Sylow 7-subgroup would be normal in the entire group. So in D_21, n7=1, so statement 1 is true.

Hmm, but I thought earlier there might be a group where n7=6. Maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps all groups of order 42 have a normal Sylow 7-subgroup. But wait, that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the group is the wreath product of C_2 and C_3, but I'm not sure. Wait, the wreath product of C_2 and C_3 would be of order 36, which is not 42. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the group is the direct product of C_7 and C_6. But C_7 is cyclic of order 7, and C_6 is cyclic of order 6. The direct product would have order 42. The Sylow 7-subgroup would be C_7, which is normal in the direct product. So in this case, statement 1 is true.

Hmm, so in these cases, statement 1 is true. But wait, perhaps the group isn't a direct product. Are there groups of order 42 where the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal?

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me consider the number of elements of order 7. In a group of order 42, the elements of order 7 are 6 (since each Sylow 7-subgroup has 6 non-identity elements). So if the group has 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, then each Sylow 7-subgroup contributes 6 unique elements of order 7. But 6*7=42, which would imply that all elements of order 7 are in the Sylow 7-subgroups, but that doesn't make sense because the Sylow 7-subgroups are of order 7, which can only have 6 elements of order 7 each, and 6*7 would be 42, but then the group would have all elements of order 7, which would mean that the group is abelian? Because in an abelian group, all elements of order 7 would commute, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, but wait. In an abelian group of order 42, which is the product of 2, 3, and 7, all Sylow subgroups would be normal. Because in an abelian group, every Sylow subgroup is normal. So in that case, statement 1 is true.

But what about non-abelian groups? Let me think of the group G = C_7 ⋊ C_6, where the semidirect product is defined by some action. The order would be 7*6=42. Now, the Sylow 7-subgroup would be of order 7, and if it's normal in the group, then statement 1 is true. But if it's not normal, then statement 1 is false.

Wait, but in the semidirect product, the Sylow 7-subgroup is a normal subgroup if the action is trivial. But if the action is non-trivial, then the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal.

Wait, but in the case where the Sylow 7-subgroup is normal, then statement 1 is true. But in some cases, it's not. So, can there be a group of order 42 where the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal?

Wait, perhaps yes. Let me think of a group of order 42 where the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal. For example, in the group G = C_7 ⋊ C_6, where the action of C_6 on C_7 is non-trivial, leading to a group where the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal.

Wait, but in that case, the Sylow 7-subgroup would have order 7 and be a subgroup of G, but not necessarily normal. So statement 1 would be false in such a group.

But wait, does such a group exist? Let me try to find an example. Let me think of G as a group where the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal. Let me take G as the group of order 42, constructed as a semidirect product of C_7 and C_6, with a non-trivial action.

Wait, but then, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups in G would be equal to the number of orbits of C_6 on C_7, which is determined by the action. The number of orbits would be equal to the number of elements in C_7 fixed by the action of C_6. Since C_6 is cyclic of order 6, it acts on C_7 by multiplying elements by some power, say, a generator of C_7.

Hmm, perhaps the action is non-trivial, leading to some elements of C_7 not being fixed. Let me think: suppose the action of C_6 on C_7 is such that it sends each element of C_7 to another element, but the number of fixed points is zero. Then, the number of orbits would be 7 / 6, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the action is such that each element of C_7 is moved to another element, but there are no fixed points, leading to a number of orbits equal to the greatest common divisor of 7 and 6, which is 1. So perhaps the action is such that there's only one fixed point, leading to 7 -1=6 orbits, but 6 doesn't divide 6. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the action is such that the number of orbits is 6, leading to 6*(7-1)=36 elements, but that's only 36 elements, but the group has 42 elements, so perhaps there are 6 more elements outside of the Sylow 7-subgroup. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of a specific example of a group of order 42 where the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal.

Wait, perhaps take G as a group of order 42 constructed as a semidirect product of C_7 and C_6, where the action of C_6 on C_7 is such that the stabilizer of each element is trivial. Then, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups would be 6, leading to n7=6.

But would such an action exist? For example, if the action of C_6 on C_7 is such that it's a cyclic permutation of the elements of C_7, then perhaps each element is moved to another, but no element is fixed. Let me think: If C_6 acts on C_7 by cyclically permuting the elements, then each element is moved to another, but the number of fixed points is zero. So, in this case, the number of orbits would be 7, but since C_6 acts on it, perhaps the orbits are 7 / gcd(6,7) = 7 /1 =7 orbits. But 7 is not compatible with the group order.

Wait, perhaps the number of Sylow 7-subgroups is 6, leading to n7=6.

Wait, so if G is constructed as a semidirect product of C_7 and C_6, with the action of C_6 on C_7 being a cyclic permutation, then each element is moved to another, but perhaps no elements are fixed. So, the number of orbits would be 7, and each orbit would have 6 elements, but 7*6=42, which matches the group order.

But wait, that can't be the case because C_7 is cyclic of order 7, so it's a single orbit under the action. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the group as being the direct product of C_7 and C_6, but that's of order 42. Wait, no, C_7 is order 7, and C_6 is order 6, so their direct product is order 42, but in that case, the Sylow 7-subgroup would be C_7, which is normal. So statement 1 would be true.

But perhaps there's a group of order 42 where the Sylow 7-subgroup is not normal. Let me think of the group as being constructed as a semidirect product of C_7 and C_6, but with the action being non-trivial, leading to n7=6.

In that case, the group of order 42 would have 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of which is a cyclic subgroup of order 7, and each has 6 elements. So the total number of elements of order 7 would be 6*6=36, but the group has only 42 elements. So that would leave 6 elements that are not of order 7. Wait, that can't be, because every group must have elements of order equal to the group's order divided by its greatest common divisor with the group's order.

Wait, the group order is 42. The group's order divided by the greatest common divisor with the group's order is 42 / gcd(42, n) for each element n in the group. Let me see, for each element n, the order of n must divide 42. So, possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.

Wait, but if n is an element of order 14, then 14 divides the group order (42), which it does. Similarly for 21 and 42.

Wait, but the group of order 42 would have elements of each of these orders. So, how many elements of each order?

Well, in an abelian group, elements of the same order commute, but non-abelian groups can have more complicated structures.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let me think of the group as having 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, each of order 7, and each contributing 6 elements of order 7. 6*7=42, which would mean that all elements of order 7 are accounted for. But that would require that every element of order 7 is in a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which would imply that all Sylow 7-subgroups are normal, which can't be the case if n7=6.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. If the number of Sylow 7-subgroups is 6, then each Sylow 7-subgroup would contain 7 elements, including the identity. So, the total number of elements contributed by all Sylow 7-subgroups would be 6*(7) =42, which includes the identity element once. So, the total number of elements of order 7 would be 6*(7-1)=36.

But the group has 42 elements, so 36 elements of order 7 and 6 elements of order 1. That would mean that the group is made up of a normal Sylow 7-subgroup (order 7) and a normal Sylow 3-subgroup (order 3), leading to a normal subgroup of order 21, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, but if the group has 36 elements of order 7 and 6 elements of order 1, that would imply that the group has a normal subgroup of order 21, which is the product of a Sylow 7-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup. Then, the quotient group would be of order 2, which is cyclic. So, the group would be abelian, which can't be the case because Sylow 7-subgroups are not normal.

Wait, so perhaps the group cannot have 6 Sylow 7-subgroups. Therefore, perhaps n7 must be 1, making statement 1 true.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of the number of elements of order 7. Each Sylow 7-subgroup contributes 6 elements of order 7. So, if there are 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, that would account for 6*6=36 elements of order 7. But 36+6=42, which would account for all the elements. But that would imply that the group has a normal subgroup of order 21, but that would make the group abelian, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, perhaps n7 cannot be 6, meaning that the only possible case is n7=1, which makes statement 1 true.

So, statement 1 is true, and statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct option is C: statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: the number of elements of order 7 is 6*(n7-1), where n7 is the number of Sylow 7-subgroups. So, 6*(n7-1) must be less than or equal to 42.

But in our earlier analysis, if n7=6, then 6*(6-1)=30 elements of order 7, leaving 12 elements of order 1. That can't be right, as the group would have a normal subgroup of order 21, leading to a contradiction.

Therefore, perhaps n7 cannot be 6, meaning that n7=1 is the only possibility, making statement 1 true.

So, in conclusion, statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false. So, the correct option is C: statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false.
</think>

The correct answer is C: statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false.

**Explanation:**

1. **Statement 1: Every group of order 42 has a subgroup of order 7.**
   - The order of the group is 42, which factors as 2 × 3 × 7.
   - By Sylow's Theorem, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n7) must divide 6 and be congruent to 1 mod 7. The only possibility is n7 = 1.
   - Therefore, there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, which is cyclic of order 7. Hence, every group of order 42 has a subgroup of order 7.
   - **Conclusion:** Statement 1 is true.

2. **Statement 2: Every group of order 42 has a subgroup of order 21.**
   - A subgroup of order 21 must be the product of a Sylow 7-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup.
   - If the Sylow 7-subgroups are normal (n7 = 1), then the product of any Sylow 7-subgroup and a Sylow 3-subgroup forms a subgroup of order 21.
   - However, if the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n7) is not 1, then the Sylow 7-subgroups are not normal, and their product might not form a subgroup of order 21.
   - Specifically, if n7 = 6, the group would have 6 Sylow 7-subgroups, each contributing 6 elements of order 7, totaling 36 elements of order 7. This would leave 6 elements of order 1, which are the identity element. This would imply the existence of a normal subgroup of order 21, leading to a contradiction since the Sylow 7-subgroups would not be normal.
   - Therefore, the only possible case is n7 = 1, making statement 2 true.
   - **Conclusion:** Statement 2 is true.

**Final Answer:** C: statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false.
