Alright, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Harlow's monkey experiment. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

So, the question is asking which statement was illustrated by Harlow's monkey experiment. The options are A through G. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to recall.

I remember that Harlow's experiment was a study in the 1980s. I think it was one of the first experiments regarding primates and their abilities. It was part of a broader field called neuroanatomy, which looks at how the nervous system works in animals.

So, Harlow's experiment probably showed that primates can learn complex tasks. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Language is a uniquely human skill. That doesn't fit because Harlow's work was about primates.

Option B: Physical contact is important for development. I'm not sure. I think some studies have shown contact, but Harlow's was about learning, not necessarily physical contact.

Option C: Hierarchy based on physical strength. Again, Harlow's might not directly address hierarchy but more about learning.

Option D: Monkeys prefer inanimate objects. That sounds more like a preference study, maybe something like a preference test, but I'm not sure Harlow's was about that.

Option E: Primates can learn complex tasks. That rings a bell. Harlow's experiment was about whether primates can learn tasks, like a maze, which would suggest they can handle complex tasks. So E seems correct.

Option F: Recognize themselves in mirrors. That's more about behavior recognition and self-referential abilities, which I think might be studied in another experiment, maybe like the "mirror study" by Harlow.

Option G: Make and use tools. That's more about tool use, which wasn't the focus of Harlow's original experiment.

Putting it together, I think the correct answer is E. Harlow's monkey experiment was about whether primates could learn to navigate a maze, implying they could perform complex tasks. So the statement that matches would be E: that primates can learn complex tasks.

The correct answer is E: that primates can learn complex tasks.
