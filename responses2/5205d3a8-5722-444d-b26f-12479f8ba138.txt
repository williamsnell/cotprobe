Alright, so I have this problem here: compute the product (20)(-8) in Z_26. Hmm, Z_26 is the ring of integers modulo 26. So, I'm trying to remember how multiplication works in modular arithmetic.

First, I should probably compute 20 multiplied by -8 first, and then take the result modulo 26. Wait, but what's 20 times -8? Let's calculate that. 20 times 8 is 160. So, 20*(-8) is -160. Now, I need to find what -160 is congruent to modulo 26.

But wait, maybe it's easier to compute 20 * (-8) mod 26. Alternatively, I can compute 20 * (-8 mod 26) first. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because -8 mod 26 is the same as 18, right? Because 26 -8 is 18. So, -8 is congruent to 18 in Z_26.

So, 20 multiplied by 18. Let me compute that. 20 * 18 is 360. Now, I have to find 360 mod 26. Let me see how many times 26 fits into 360.

26 times 13 is 338 because 26*10 is 260, and 26*3 is 78, so 260+78=338. 360 minus 338 is 22. So, 360 mod 26 is 22. Therefore, the product (20)(-8) in Z_26 is 22.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again because I might have messed up. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 20 mod 26 first, which is obviously 20. And -8 mod 26 is 18. So 20 * 18 = 360. Now, 360 divided by 26: 26*13 is 338, as I thought. 360-338=22, so yes, 22 is the correct remainder. So the answer should be 22, which is option I.

The product (20)(-8) in Z_26 is computed by first finding each element modulo 26: 20 mod 26 is 20, and -8 mod 26 is 18. Then, 20 Ã— 18 = 360. Dividing 360 by 26 gives a remainder of 22. Therefore, the product is 22.

Answer: I: 22
