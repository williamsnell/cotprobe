Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

A person walks 3 miles east, then 10 miles north, then 6 miles west, and finally 16 miles south. I need to find out how far they are from the starting point. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick one.

Hmm, I think I should break this down into directions. Maybe I can model this as a coordinate system where each direction changes the position. Let me imagine starting at the origin point (0,0). 

First, walking east. East is the positive x-direction, so moving 3 miles east would take us to (3,0). 

Next, turning north and walking 10 miles. North is the positive y-direction, so adding 10 to the y-coordinate. Current position is now (3,10). 

Then, turning west and walking 6 miles. West is the negative x-direction, so subtracting 6 from the x-coordinate. That brings us to (3-6, 10) = (-3,10). 

Finally, turning south and walking 16 miles. South is the negative y-direction, so subtracting 16 from the y-coordinate. So, our final position is (-3,10-16) = (-3,-6).

Wait, so from (0,0) to (-3,-6). To find the distance from the starting point, I can use the distance formula. The formula is sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 ). Here, (x1,y1) is (0,0) and (x2,y2) is (-3,-6).

So the differences are (-3 - 0) = -3 (x) and (-6 -0) = -6 (y). Squaring those gives 9 and 36. Adding them together: 9 + 36 = 45. The square root of 45 is approximately 6.708 miles. Looking at the options, option G is 6.7, which seems to fit.

The person's movements form a path that ends at (-3,-6) from the origin. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from the origin is sqrt(3² +6²)=sqrt(45)=approximately 6.7 miles. The closest option is G: 6.7.

Answer: G
