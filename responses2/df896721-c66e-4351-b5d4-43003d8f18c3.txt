Question:

Watson and Noble (2005) lay out a five-step model for circular evaluation. At which step should pre-testing of strategy and tactics be carried out?

D: The pre-testing step is not included in the model
E: 1
F: 4
G: 6
H: 3
I: At the beginning of the process
J: 5

Okay, so I have this question about Watson and Noble's model for circular evaluation. It's asking where pre-testing of strategy and tactics should be placed in their five-step model. The options are A through J, with each step numbered from 1 to 6.

First, I'll try to remember what each step in the circular evaluation process entails. I think the steps generally involve planning, execution, evaluation, etc. But Watson and Noble's model might have a different structure.

I recall that Watson and Noble's circular evaluation model includes planning, implementation, evaluation, and sometimes a final review. Each step has its own place. Let me try to outline it. 

Wait, the model they describe is a five-step process. So maybe the steps are something like: planning, evaluation, pre-testing, feedback, and then in some cases, further steps. Or perhaps the steps are planning, evaluation, testing, assessment, and then another step for review.

Alternatively, I think the model might be similar to the Lean methodology's steps. In Lean, you have plan, execute, measure, analyze, act. But in a circular model, maybe the steps are a bit different.

Wait, according to what I remember, Watson and Noble's model typically includes planning, evaluation, testing, assessment, and then actions. So if the steps are 1 to 5, perhaps the order is:

1. Planning
2. Evaluation
3. Testing
4. Assessment
5. Actions

So in that case, pre-testing would fall under testing. But wait, the question is about where pre-testing is placed. Or maybe I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, another idea: maybe the steps are planning, evaluation, testing, assessment, and finally actions. So pre-testing is part of the testing step. So it would be placed after evaluation but before action. 

Looking at the options, option H is 3, which is the third step. Option B is 2, which is evaluation. So if pre-testing is part of testing, which is step 3, then the correct answer would be H.

Alternatively, let me think again. Let me try to outline the steps as I remember. The model is called a circular evaluation process, which I think involves planning, evaluation, testing, assessment, and then taking action.

Wait, perhaps the steps are planning, evaluation, testing, assessment, and then in the last step, actions. So pre-testing would be part of the testing step, which is the third step. So H would be the right answer.

Wait, another thing: in some models, pre-testing is part of evaluation. Or maybe it's considered part of testing. So if the model is planning (step 1), evaluation (step 2), testing (step 3), assessment (step 4), and actions (step 5), then pre-testing would be part of the testing phase, which is step 3. So the answer would be H.

Alternatively, I might have the order wrong. Let me think again. In the circular evaluation, the process is structured so that after planning, you evaluate the plan, then test it by implementing it to see if it works. Then you assess the results, and then take action based on that. So the steps would be:

1. Planning
2. Evaluation
3. Testing
4. Assessment
5. Actions

So pre-testing would be part of the testing phase, which is the third step. So the correct option is H, which is 3.

The correct answer is H.
