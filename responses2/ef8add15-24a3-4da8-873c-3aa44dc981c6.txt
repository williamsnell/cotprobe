Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Nussbaum's views on virtues and their specifications. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about what Nussbaum claims about the specification of particular virtues. The options are A to J. I remember that Nussbaum is a sociologist who wrote about virtues and deviant behavior. His main idea is that virtues are not absolute or fixed but are shaped by cultural contexts. I think he argues that virtues are not universal or personal but depend on the specific culture and social norms.

Looking at the options:

A: Can only be determined by religious institutions. Hmm, I don't think that's right. Nussbaum says it's not religious, it's cultural.

B: Strictly based on personal belief systems. No, that doesn't sound right either. I think he thinks it's more about social and cultural factors.

C: Can be universally agreed upon without cultural differences. That doesn't make sense. If it's culture-dependent, it can't be agreed upon universally.

D: Can be settled in such a way as to be no longer revisable. Not sure about this. I don't recall him making that specific claim.

E: Might sometimes turn out to be a disjunction. Disjunction sounds like a logical problem, not sure if that's his view.

F: Will always be consistent across all societies. I think that's a point he makes. He says virtues are consistent within societies but can vary between them.

G: Is influenced solely by an individual's personal experiences. No, that seems too narrow. Nussbaum says it's about culture, so it's more about social and cultural influences.

H: Is always subject to change and cannot be finalized. Wait, Nussbaum's view is that virtues can be changed and not fixed. So if H says it can't be finalized, that's opposite of what he said.

I: Will always consist of a single answer. I don't think that's right. Virtues can be complex, not just a single trait.

J: Is necessarily relative to a culture. That sounds correct. He argues that virtues are relative and depend on the culture.

Wait, let me double-check the options. So the question is, which option does Nussbaum claim. From what I remember, J is a correct statement. Let me think if any other options fit better.

Option B says it's strictly based on personal belief systems. No, Nussbaum says it's more about the context.

Option F says it's consistent across all societies. Does he say that? Let me think again. I think he does claim that virtues are consistent within a society but can vary between. So F is correct but the question is about what he claims.

Wait, the question is asking which option Nussbaum claims. So the correct answer would be J: is necessarily relative to a culture.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

E: Might sometimes turn out to be a disjunction.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about Nussbaum's main idea. He argues that virtues are not absolute but are shaped by culture, so they're relative and vary across societies.

So for each option:

A: Incorrect, Nussbaum says it's not religious.

B: Incorrect, he doesn't think it's personal.

C: Incorrect, not universal.

D: I don't know, maybe not.

E: Not sure, but I think he doesn't say that.

F: Correct, but the question is which he claims. So perhaps F is correct but it's not the one.

Wait, the question is about which option Nussbaum claims.

Wait, the options:

The question is about what Nussbaum claims. So the correct answer is J: is necessarily relative to a culture.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that F was correct (that virtues are consistent across societies). But I thought Nussbaum claims that F is correct, but perhaps he also claims that J is correct. Wait, the question is, which of the above is what Nussbaum claims.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the options.

The options are statements about what Nussbaum claims. So the correct answer would be the one he says. So, for example, if it's option F, then the correct answer is F. But from my initial thought, I thought F was correct, but I'm not entirely certain. Wait, I think Nussbaum says that virtues are consistent within a society but not across all societies. So F is correct, but the question is which option he claims. So the answer is J: is necessarily relative to a culture.

Wait, wait. Wait, let's think again. The question is which answer Nussbaum claims. So looking at the options:

Option F: "will always be consistent across all societies." I think that's correct according to Nussbaum. Because he says that virtues are consistent within a culture but don't necessarily hold across all societies. So F is correct, but the question is which one he claims.

Wait, no, wait. The options are A to J, each a claim. So the question is, which of these is what Nussbaum claims.

So Nussbaum's claims are:

- Virtues are relative and vary by culture.

- Virtues are not absolute; they're shaped by culture.

So looking at the options, the correct answer is J: is necessarily relative to a culture.

Alternatively, the option F is correct, but the question is about what he claims. So which option is correct.

Wait, but the question says Nussbaum claims that the specification of particular virtues is... Let me think again.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about each option.

Option A: can only be determined by religious institutions. I think Nussbaum says it's not about religion.

Option B: strictly based on personal belief systems. No, he doesn't think so.

Option C: can be universally agreed upon without cultural differences. No, that's the opposite.

Option D: settled in such a way as to be no longer revisable. Unrelated.

Option E: might turn out to be a disjunction. Not sure.

Option F: will always be consistent across all societies. I think Nussbaum says that virtues are consistent within a society but not across all. So F is correct, but if the question is about what he claims, perhaps F is correct, but I'm not certain.

Option G: influenced solely by personal experiences. No, culture is involved.

Option H: always subject to change and cannot be finalized. That's the opposite of what he said. So H is incorrect.

Option I: always consist of a single answer. No, he says they're complex.

Option J: is relative to culture. That's correct.

So the correct answer should be J.
</think>

The question asks which option Nussbaum claims about the specification of virtues. To determine the correct answer, it's essential to recall Nussbaum's views on virtues. He argues that virtues are not absolute or fixed but are relative and vary by culture. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Nussbaum does not claim that virtues are only determined by religious institutions.
- **B**: Incorrect. He claims that virtues are not strictly based on personal belief systems.
- **C**: Incorrect. Virtues cannot be universally agreed upon without cultural differences.
- **D**: Incorrect. He does not claim that virtues can be settled in a way that is no longer revisable.
- **E**: Incorrect. Nussbaum does not suggest that virtues might turn out to be a disjunction.
- **F**: Correct. Nussbaum claims that virtues are consistent within a society but not necessarily across all societies.
- **G**: Incorrect. Virtues are influenced by cultural and social factors, not solely by personal experiences.
- **H**: Incorrect. Nussbaum does not believe virtues are always subject to change and can be finalized.
- **I**: Incorrect. Virtues are complex and not always consist of a single answer.
- **J**: Correct. Nussbaum claims that virtues are necessarily relative to a culture.

Thus, the correct answer is **J: is necessarily relative to a culture**.
