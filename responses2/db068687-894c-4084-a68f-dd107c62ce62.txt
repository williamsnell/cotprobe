Okay, so I have this question about vitamins and their functions. The question asks which of the options is not a function of vitamin A. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, I remember that vitamin A is called retinol, and it's a fat-soluble vitamin. It's essential for the skin, eyeight, and the immune system. So, let's go through the options.

Option A: Synthesis of blood clotting proteins. I think vitamin A is involved in blood clotting. It's a cofactor for proteins like fibrin, which help form blood clots. So A is a function, so it's not the answer.

Option B: Prevention of bone loss. Oh wait, I'm not sure about this. I remember that vitamin A is important for bone health. I think the main ones are vitamin A2 and A3, but maybe A is also involved. Wait, no. Wait, another thought: bone health is more about vitamin A1, which is found in animal products. So if A is vitamin A, it's more for eye and skin, not directly preventing bone loss. Or wait, maybe the question is about which isn't a function. If A is a function, then the incorrect one would be another.

Option C: Regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation. That definitely sounds like a function. Vitamin A affects gene expression by helping the cell sense its environment, which might influence differentiation. So C is a function.

Option D: Boosting immune system function. Yes, vitamin A does that. It helps the immune system recognize and fight viral infections by aiding in the production of antibodies.

So, the options that are functions of vitamin A: A, C, D. The one that isn't is B. Because I'm trying to recall if A directly helps prevent bone loss. Wait, I think bone health is more dependent on vitamin A1, which is a different vitamin. So vitamin A might not be directly involved in preventing bone loss, making option B not a function of vitamin A.

The correct answer is B: Prevention of bone loss. Vitamin A is not directly involved in preventing bone loss but is more important for other functions like immune system activation and blood clotting. 

Answer: B
