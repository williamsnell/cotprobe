Question:

Johnstown Mills manufactures cotton fabrics. Overhead is allocated to each department according to the ratio of total overhead to the total prime cost. During February, total direct labor costs came to $216,000 and the cost of materials to $84,000. The total overhead for the month was $45,000. Find the overhead percent of prime cost to be charged to each department. Then find the amount of overhead to be charged to the Design Department with a prime cost of $18,500.

Options:

A: 20%, $3,700
B: 22%, $4,070
C: 18%, $3,330
D: 30%, $5,550
E: 10%, $1,850
F: 25%, $4,625
G: 28%, $5,180
H: 15%, $2,775
I: 35%, $6,475
J: 12%, $2,220

Okay, so I've got this problem here about overhead percentages for Johnstown Mills. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The question says that overhead is allocated to each department based on the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. Oh right, prime cost is the sum of direct materials and direct labor. So first, I need to calculate the total prime cost for the month.

Wait, the problem gives me the direct labor costs as $216,000 and materials as $84,000. So adding those together, the total prime cost is 216,000 plus 84,000. Let me add that: 216k + 84k is 300,000. So total prime cost is $300,000.

The total overhead for the month was $45,000. So the overhead allocation ratio is overhead over prime cost. That would be 45,000 divided by 300,000. Let me calculate that: 45k /300k is 0.15. So that's 15%, right? So the overhead percent is 15%, which is option H. That's one part done.

Now, the second part asks for the amount of overhead to be charged to the Design Department, which has a prime cost of $18,500. Since the overhead is allocated based on the prime cost, I need to find what 15% of $18,500 is.

Calculating 15% of 18,500. Let me do that: 0.15 * 18,500. Hmm, 10% is 1,850, 5% is 925. So adding them, 1,850 + 925 is 2,775. So the overhead charge is $2,775. Wait, but looking back at the options, H is 15% and $2,775. So that would be option H, but wait, I thought the first part was 15%, option H. But I thought the question is about the Design Department's overhead. But wait, the options are A to J, and the choices are each with a percentage and a dollar amount. So for each department, we calculate the percentage of prime cost times the total overhead.

Wait, no: the first question was to find the overhead percent of prime cost, which is 15%, so that's option H. Then the second part is to find the overhead charged to the Design Department with prime cost $18,500. So the calculation is 15% of 18,500, which is $2,775, but that's not an option I see. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, H is 15%, 2775. So the second part's answer is $2,775. But wait, the options only have each option as a percentage and a dollar amount. So the Design Department will have 15% * 18,500 = 2775, which is option H. But wait, looking at the options, option H is 15%, $2,775. So the answer for the second part is H's value. But looking at the options, each option is a separate choice. Wait, the question says "then find the amount of overhead to be charged to the Design Department...". So the options are each a pair of percentage and dollar amount.

Wait, the options are A to J, each with a percentage and a dollar. So the Design Department's overhead is 15% of 18,500, which is $2,775. Therefore, the answer would be H. So the first part is 15% (option H), the second part is $2,775 (option H as part of the pair). But wait, the options are each a separate choice, so the second part's answer would be option H as the second item. But the problem is, the options are labeled A to J, each with a pair. So the second part's answer is H.

Wait, let me check all the options again.

The options are:

A: 20%, $3,700

B: 22%, $4,070

C:18%, $3,330

D:30%, $5,550

E:10%, $1,850

F:25%, $4,625

G:28%, $5,180

H:15%, $2,775

I:35%, $6,475

J:12%, $2,220

So for the Design Department, the overhead is 15% of 18,500, which is $2,775. So that's option H. So the answer for the second part is H.

Wait, but the question is asking for the amount of overhead to be charged to the Design Department. So the first part is 15% and the second is $2,775. So the correct pair would be option H, but looking back, the options are each a pair, and the question is, after finding the overhead percent, then calculating the specific amount. So the options are each a combination of percentage and dollar. So the correct answer is H: 15% and $2,775. So the correct option is H. But wait, the question is asking for both the percentage and the amount. So the correct answer is H.

The overhead percent of prime cost is calculated as 15%, so option H. The amount of overhead charged to the Design Department is 15% of $18,500, which is $2,775. Therefore, the correct pair is H.

Answer: H
