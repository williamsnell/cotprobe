Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember from my group theory class that certain sets are groups under specific operations, and other times they're not. The question involves two statements about group theory and modular arithmetic. 

Statement 1 says that for n > 1, the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n. Hmm, wait. I think I remember that this is only true under certain conditions. Let me think. I remember that for a group, the set needs to satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses. 

So, closure under multiplication modulo n means that any two elements multiplied together should result in another element in the set. But wait, what's the identity element here? Oh right, 1 is the multiplicative identity. So 1 times any element leaves it unchanged, which is definitely in the set. So that's covered.

Associativity is also a property that holds for multiplication in general, so modulo n doesn't affect that. 

The tricky part is the inverses. For every element a in the set, there must exist some element b in the set such that a * b ≡ 1 mod n. But not every number less than n has a multiplicative inverse modulo n. For example, if n is not a prime, then some numbers won't have inverses. Specifically, a number a has an inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime. So, the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} forms a group under multiplication modulo n only if all elements are coprime with n. But wait, that's not necessarily the case. If n is composite, some elements won't have inverses. 

Wait, let me think again. I thought that the multiplicative group modulo n exists when n is a prime. Because if n is prime, every number from 1 to n-1 is coprime with n, so inverses exist for all elements. But if n is composite, some elements won't have inverses. So Statement 1 is only true when n is prime. But the statement doesn't specify that n is prime. It just says for n > 1. So Statement 1 is False because it's not always true. For example, take n=4. The set {1,2,3} under multiplication mod 4. Let's check inverses: 

1's inverse is 1.
2's inverse would be a number b such that 2b ≡1 mod4. Let's see: 2*1=2 mod4, 2*2=0, 2*3=6≡2 mod4. So no inverse for 2.
3: 3*3=9≡1 mod4, so inverse is 3. 

So in this case, 2 doesn't have an inverse. So the set {1,2,3} isn't a group under multiplication mod4 because not all elements have inverses. Thus, Statement 1 is False.

Now, Statement 2: There exists an integer x such that 63x ≡1 mod100. Hmm, this is about finding the modular inverse of 63 modulo 100. The inverse exists if and only if 63 and 100 are coprime. Let's check their greatest common divisor (GCD). Using the Euclidean algorithm: 

100 divided by 63 is 1 with remainder 37. 
63 divided by 37 is 1 with remainder 26. 
37 divided by 26 is 1 with remainder 11. 
26 divided by 11 is 2 with remainder 4. 
11 divided by 4 is 2 with remainder 3. 
4 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 1. 
3 divided by 1 is 3 with remainder 0. 

So the GCD is 1. That means 63 and 100 are coprime, so an inverse exists. So Statement 2 is True.

Now the options are about whether these statements are True or False. Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is True. So looking back at the options, which ones match? 

Looking at the options provided:

Options A: False, True → That would match our analysis (False for 1, True for 2). 

But the options are combinations of True/False for both statements. Let's go through each option:

Option A: False, True → Both are True and False. That would mean both statements are correct, which is not the case. Because Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is True. So option A is False, True. But the first part is False (Statement 1), second part is True (Statement 2). So Option A says both are correct? No, that's wrong. So Option A is False, True. Wait, no. Wait, no, the first part is False (Statement 1 is False), second part is True (Statement 2 is True). So the option is False, True. 

Looking at the options:

A: False, True → yes, that's correct. Because Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is True.

Other options: 

Option B: False, False and x is less than 100. But Statement 2 is True, not False. So no.

Option C: False, True and x is an odd number. No, Statement 2 is True, but Statement 2's truth doesn't imply anything about x's value. So perhaps that's a red herring.

Option D: True, True and x is a prime number. No, because Statement 1 is False, so D is wrong.

Option E: False, True and x is a prime. Again, Statement 1 is False, so E is False.

Option F: True, True and x is a multiple of 7. Statement 1 is False, so F is wrong.

Option G: True, False and x is a multiple of 10. Again, Statement 1 is False, so G is wrong.

Option H: True, True. No, because Statement 1 is False.

Option I: False, False. No, because Statement 2 is True.

Option J: True, False. No, because Statement 2 is True.

So the correct option is A: False, True. So the answer is option A.

The analysis shows that Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is True. Thus, the correct option is A: False, True.
