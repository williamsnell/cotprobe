Okay, so I've got this question about the Bohr radius and the corresponding frequency of light. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the Bohr radius is a physical constant that's used in atomic models. The problem says the Bohr radius is 0.5292 × 10^-8 cm. I need to find the frequency of a light wave that has the same wavelength as this radius.

Wait, right, frequency and wavelength are related by the speed of light. Oh yeah, the formula is c = λν, where c is the speed of light, λ is the wavelength, and ν is the frequency. So, if I rearrange that, ν = c / λ. That makes sense because higher frequency means shorter wavelength, and vice versa.

But wait, what are the units here? The Bohr radius is in centimeters, but the speed of light is usually given in meters per second, right? Oh, I need to convert the Bohr radius into meters because the speed of light is 3.00 × 10^10 m/s. So, 0.5292 × 10^-8 cm is equal to 0.5292 × 10^-10 meters. Because 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1e-8 cm is 1e-10 m.

So λ is 0.5292 × 1e-10 meters. Then, ν = c / λ. Let me plug in the numbers. c is 3e8 m/s. So, ν = 3e8 / (0.5292e-10) m. Let me compute that.

Wait, let me think about the units again. cm to m: 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 0.5292e-8 cm is 0.5292e-8 * 0.01 m = 0.5292e-10 m. Yep. So, λ = 0.5292e-10 m.

So, ν = 3e8 m/s / (0.5292e-10 m) = (3e8) / (5.292e-11) [because 0.5292e-10 is 5.292e-11]. Let me compute that.

3e8 divided by 5.292e-11. Let me compute 3e8 / 5.292e-11. 3 divided by 5.292 is approximately 0.566, and 1e8 divided by 1e-11 is 1e19. So, 0.566e19 is 5.66e18 Hz. Hmm, let me calculate more accurately.

3e8 = 3 *1e8. 5.292e-10 m is 5.292 * 1e-10. So dividing 3e8 by 5.292e-10 is same as (3 / 5.292) * (1e8 / 1e-10) ) → 0.566 * 1e18 → 5.66e18.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that option A is 5.665e17, B is 7.665e17, etc. Wait, my calculation gives around 5.66e18. But that's not an option. Oh wait, the options are all in the 1e17 or 1e18 range.

Wait maybe I made a mistake in the exponent. Let's redo the calculation.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 0.5292e-8 cm. Oh wait, no, that's 0.5292e-10 m. So, 3e8 / (0.5292e-10) = (3e8) / (5.292e-11) → 3e8 /5.292e-11 = (3 / 5.292) * 1e(8 - (-11)) → (3/5.292) * 1e19.

Wait, 8 - (-11) is 19. So 3 divided by 5.292 is approximately 0.566. Multiply by 1e19 gives 5.66e18. So the frequency is 5.66e18 Hz. Oh, but looking at the options, option D is 3.665e18, E is 6.665e18, etc. Wait, none of the options match 5.66e18. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait another possibility: Did I mix up the exponent? Because 0.5292e-8 cm is 0.5292e-10 m. So 3e8 / 0.5292e-10 m is 3e8 / (5.292e-11) = (3 / 5.292) * 1e19. Let me compute 3 divided by 5.292. Let's do this more accurately.

5.292 × 0.5 is 2.646, which is less than 3. 5.292 × 0.56 is 2.96032. 5.292 × 0.57 is about 3.000 (because 5.292 × 0.004 is 0.021168, so 0.57 ×5.292 is 2.998). Wait, 0.57 *5.292 is 5.292 *0.5=2.646, 5.292 *0.07=0.37044; sum 2.646 +0.37044=3.01644. Oh wait, that's more than 3, but perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, 5.292 × x =3. Let me compute 3 /5.292. Let's write it as 3000 / 5292.

Dividing 3000 by 5292:

5292 goes into 30000 5 times (5*5292=26460), remainder 3540 (30000−26460=3540). Bring down zero, 35400.

5292 × 6=31752. 6×5292=31752. 35400−31752=3648.

Bring down a zero: 36480. 5292 ×6=31752. 600*5292? Wait, 5292 ×6=31752. So subtract 31752 from 36480→ 4728.

Hmm, this is getting tedious. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach isn't feasible here, but perhaps using an approximate value. So 3/5.292 is approximately 0.566.

So 0.566 multiplied by 1e19 is 5.66e18 Hz. But looking at the options, none of them have 5.66e18. Instead, the options are in the 1e17 or 1e18 range.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent. Oh wait, perhaps the Bohr radius is in meters? Let me check. Oh wait, the question says the Bohr radius is 0.5292 ×10^-8 cm. So that's 0.5292e-8 cm, which is 0.5292e-10 meters.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the calculation, and the exponent was wrong? Let's think again: 0.5292e-8 cm = 5.292e-10 m.

So, 3e8 /5.292e-10 = (3e8) / (5.292e-10) = (3 /5.292) * 1e8 + 10 → 1e18? Wait, because 10 exponents: 8 +10 =18.

So 3/5.292 is about 0.566 → 0.566e18 → 5.66e17? Wait, no, because 0.566e18 is 5.66e17? No, wait, 0.566e18 is 5.66e17. Because 0.566 *1e18 is 5.66e17.

Wait, wait, 1e18 is 10^18, which is 10 times 1e17. So 0.566e18 is 5.66e17. So the frequency is 5.66e17 Hz.

Looking back at the options, option A is 5.665 ×1e17, which matches.

But wait, the options don't have any other option with 5.66e17 except option A. So why are the other options higher? Let me check if I made a mistake somewhere again.

Wait, another way to compute 3e8 / 5.292e-10: 3e8 is 300,000,000. 5.292e-10 is 0.0000000005292.

So 300,000,000 divided by 0.0000000005292. Let me compute this as 3e8 /5.292e-10 = (3 /5.292) * 1e18.

Wait, no: 3e8 is 3 * 1e8. 5.292e-10 is 5.292 * 1e-10.

So when you divide 3e8 by 5.292e-10, it's (3 /5.292) * (1e8 /1e-10) = (0.566) * 1e18 → 0.566e18 → 5.66e17, which is 5.66 ×1e17.

So the frequency is 5.66e17 Hz. Looking at the options, option A is 5.665e17.

Wait, but the question is about the same wavelength as the Bohr radius. The Bohr radius is 0.5292e-8 cm. So the wavelength is 0.5292e-8 cm, which is 5.292e-10 meters. So the frequency is c / λ, which is 3e8 m/s / 5.292e-10 m = (3e8)/(5.292e-10) Hz.

Wait, 3e8 /5.292e-10 is 3e8 * 1/(5.292e-10) = 3e8 / 5.292e-10 = 3 /5.292 * 1e(8+10) → 3/(5.292) is approximately 0.566, 1e18 → 5.66e18 Hz. So why the discrepancy, because 5.66e18 is option E? Or A?

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute 3e8 divided by 5.292e-10: 3e8 /5.292e-10 = (3e8) / (5.292e-10) = (3 /5.292) * (1e8 /1e-10) = (0.566) * 1e18 → 5.66e17 Hz.

So that's 5.66 × 1e17, which is option A: 5.665 ×1e17.

But wait, the calculation I just did gives 5.66e17, but option A is 5.665e17. Close enough. So the answer is option A.

To determine the frequency of a light wave with the same wavelength as the Bohr radius, we use the relationship between wavelength (λ), frequency (ν), and the speed of light (c): 

\[
c = \lambda \nu \quad \Rightarrow \quad \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}.
\]

The Bohr radius is given as \( 0.5292 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \). Converting this to meters:

\[
\lambda = 0.5292 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} = 0.5292 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}.
\]

The speed of light is \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting into the formula for frequency:

\[
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{0.5292 \times 10^{-10}}.
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
\nu = \frac{3.00}{0.5292} \times 10^{8 + 10} = 0.566 \times 10^{18} = 5.66 \times 10^{17} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Thus, the frequency of the light wave is approximately \( 5.66 \times 10^{17} \, \text{Hz} \). Among the given options, the closest match is **option A: \( 5.665 \times 10^{17} \, \text{sec}^{-1} \)**.
