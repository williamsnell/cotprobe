Question:

Suppose we are told that an industry is composed of a small number of firms. Can we immediately call this industry oligopolistic? Explain.

Options:

A: An oligopoly is determined solely by the size and number of firms, without considering market dynamics or inter-firm interactions.
B: An oligopoly is indicated by the presence of only government-owned firms in a market.
C: An oligopoly exists when each firm in an industry must contemplate the possible reactions of its rivals in deciding its own behavior.
D: An oligopoly exists when there are few sellers.
E: An oligopoly refers to an industry dominated by a single firm.
F: An oligopoly is present when firms are price takers and have no control over the market price of their goods.
G: An oligopoly is characterized by many small firms that each hold a negligible fraction of the market share.
H: An oligopoly is defined by having a single firm with significant market power, while the rest have very little influence.
I: An oligopoly exists when there are many sellers in a market, each with a differentiated product.
J: An oligopoly is defined by the number of firms in an industry.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the industry described as having a small number of firms is oligopolistic. Let me break this down. I remember from my microeconomics class that oligopolies are characterized by certain conditions. 

Wait, the question says the industry is composed of a small number of firms. But does that alone mean it's oligopolistic? I think another key factor is whether these firms have market power. Oh right, oligopolies involve a few firms, but they also need to consider the reactions of other firms to their actions. Like, if one firm lowers its price, others might lower theirs too because they're in a competitive race to get the market share.

Looking at the options, option A says oligopolies are determined solely by the size and number of firms, without considering market dynamics. That doesn't sound right. Because just having a few might not be enough; the firms should also react to each other. So A is incorrect.

Option B talks about government-owned firms. That's more about ownership, not necessarily oligopolistic. So B is probably not the right answer.

Option C says an oligopoly exists when each firm considers rivals' reactions. That sounds correct because oligopolies involve strategic interactions. So C could be a contender.

Option D says few sellers. Wait, oligopolies can have many, but if they have many, they might not be oligopolistic. Hmm, I'm not sure. For example, a market with a lot of sellers but each has a small market share might not be oligopolistic. So D is a bit unclear, but maybe it's not the defining factor.

Option E says oligopolies are dominated by a single firm. Wait, that sounds like a monopoly, not oligopoly. Monopolies have one seller, oligopolies have more. So E is incorrect.

Option F is about price takers versus price setters. Monopolies are price setters, so oligopolies aren't just price takers. So F is not correct.

Option G says many small firms with negligible market share. That does fit with oligopolies, but I'm not sure if it's the only condition. The reaction aspect is also important. So G could be part of the condition, but the main thing is the reaction.

Option H says a single firm with significant power. That's more of a monopoly. So H is incorrect.

Option I says many sellers, each with a differentiated product. That sounds more like perfect competition, because in perfect competition, there are many firms with homogeneous products. So I is incorrect.

Option J says oligopolies have many firms. Wait, that's the opposite of what I was thinking earlier. Wait, no, wait. Wait, J is about many sellers, each with differentiated products, which is more like perfect competition. So J is incorrect.

Wait, going back to option C. It says each firm must consider rivals' reactions. That's the key condition, right? Because oligopolies are characterized by firms acting strategically. So without that consideration, it's not an oligopoly. So option C describes the condition correctly.

So the correct answer is C. Because the question says the industry has a small number of firms, but for it to be oligopolistic, each firm must think about what others do. So option C is the answer.

To determine whether an industry composed of a small number of firms is oligopolistic, we need to evaluate the conditions under which an oligopoly is defined. An oligopoly involves a few firms, but it also requires that each firm considers the reactions of its rivals when making decisions. Option C correctly identifies this crucial condition: "An oligopoly exists when each firm in an industry must contemplate the possible reactions of its rivals in deciding its own behavior." This accurately describes the defining feature of oligopolies.

Answer: C
