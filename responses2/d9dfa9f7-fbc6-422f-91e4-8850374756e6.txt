Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see, the question is about diluting a sulfuric acid solution. Hmm, I need to find out the final volume after dilution. 

The problem says that we have 50 ml of 3.50 M H2SO4, and we want to dilute it to 2.00 M. I remember that dilution involves concentration and volume, so I think I should use the dilution formula. Wait, right, the formula is M1V1 = M2V2. Oh yeah, M stands for molarity and V is volume.

So, in this case, M1 is 3.50 M, V1 is 50 ml. M2 is 2.00 M, and V2 is what we're trying to find. Right, let me plug in the numbers. 3.50 * 50 = 2.00 * V2. Doing the math: 3.5 *50 is 175, so 175 = 2 * V2. To find V2, I divide 175 by 2. That gives me 87.5. So the final volume should be 87.5 ml. 

Wait, but wait—sometimes dilution problems can be a bit tricky. Like, when you dilute and maybe consider the volume change due to the solution becoming more dilute. But in this case, it's just a straightforward dilution. So no, I don't think there are any other factors here. Just use the formula.

Looking at the options, option J is 87.5 ml. So I think that's the right answer. I should make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Oh wait, wait—no, M1V1 is the initial moles. So 3.50 M * 0.05 L (since 50 ml is 0.05 L) equals 0.175 moles. Then, 0.175 moles should equal 2.00 M * V2. So V2 is 0.175 / 2.00 = 0.0875 L, which is 87.5 ml. Yep. So the correct answer is J.

To solve the problem of diluting 50 ml of 3.50 M H₂SO₄ to 2.00 M, we use the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \). Here, \( M_1 = 3.50 \, \text{M} \), \( V_1 = 50 \, \text{ml} \), and \( M_2 = 2.00 \, \text{M} \). 

Applying the formula:
\[
3.50 \times 50 = 2.00 \times V_2
\]
\[
175 = 2.00 \times V_2
\]
\[
V_2 = \frac{175}{2.00} = 87.5 \, \text{ml}
\]

Thus, the final volume after dilution is 87.5 ml. 

ANSWER: J
