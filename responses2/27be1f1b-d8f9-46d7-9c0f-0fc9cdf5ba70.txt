Okay, so I have this problem here about profit maximization, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The question says that the price of a product is $50. The cost per unit is given by a function C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x², where x is the number of units produced, and C(x) is also in dollars. 

Part (a) asks for the profit function. I remember that profit is revenue minus cost. So first, I need to find the revenue function.

Revenue (R) is usually calculated as the price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Since the price is constant at $50, R(x) would be 50 times x. So R(x) = 50x.

Now, the cost function is given as C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x². So the total cost is 1000 plus 0.01x² dollars.

Profit (P) is then R(x) minus C(x). So substituting in the expressions, I get:

P(x) = R(x) - C(x)
P(x) = 50x - (1000 + 0.01x²)
Let me simplify that. Distribute the negative sign:
P(x) = 50x - 1000 - 0.01x²
I can rearrange the terms in descending order of x:
P(x) = -0.01x² + 50x - 1000

Wait, looking at the options, option H is P(x) = -0.005x² + 50x -500, and option A is -0.01x² +30x -1000. Hmm, my calculation here is -0.01x², so that's option A or H. Wait, no. Wait, I have -0.01x², which is option A. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back, option A is P(x) = -0.01x² +30x -1000.

Wait, but I got 50x -1000 -0.01x², so the coefficient of x is 50, not 30. Oh, so option H has 50x, but it's -0.005x², which isn't matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the cost function and revenue. The cost per unit is C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x². So, when x is zero, the cost is 1000. If x is 1000, then C(1000) = 1000 + 0.01*(1000)^2 = 1000 + 0.01*1e6 = 1000 + 10,000 = 11,000. So that's correct.

Wait, then revenue is 50x. So profit is 50x minus 11,000 when x is 1000. So when x is 1000, profit is 50,000 - 11,000 = 39,000. So in the profit function, the constant term is -1000, which comes from the fixed cost.

So putting it all together, P(x) = -0.01x² + 50x -1000. Now, looking at the options, option A is P(x) = -0.01x² +30x -1000. Wait, that doesn't match. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine the cost function. Oh wait, wait a minute. Wait, is the cost function 1000 +0.01x², which is correct. So the cost is fixed plus variable.

So, profit is correct: P(x) = R(x) - C(x) =50x - (1000 + 0.01x²) = -0.01x² +50x -1000.

Looking at the options, option A has 30x, but I have 50x. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see.

Wait, maybe the problem says that the cost per unit is C(x) =1000 +0.01x². So perhaps the fixed cost is 1000, but maybe the revenue is not just 50x? Wait, no. If the price is fixed at $50 per unit, then revenue per unit is 50x, yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I forgot to consider that the cost is per unit, so C(x) is the total cost, which is 1000 +0.01x². So my setup is correct.

So the profit function is -0.01x² +50x -1000. Now, let's look at the options again.

Option A: -0.01x² +30x -1000, x=1500.

Option H: -0.005x² +50x -500, x=1000.

Wait, none of the options seem to match exactly except perhaps I might have miscalculated. Let me check the math again.

Wait, wait a second. I think I might have miscalculated the revenue. Because cost per unit is given as C(x) =1000 +0.01x². So if x is the number of units, then the total cost is 1000 +0.01x². So that's right.

Revenue is definitely 50x. So profit is 50x minus (1000 +0.01x²) = -0.01x² +50x -1000. So this matches option A's P(x) = -0.01x² +30x -1000, but the x term is 30 instead of 50. Hmm. Wait, that suggests that I must have made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I got the revenue wrong. If the price is $50, and x is the number of units sold, then revenue is indeed 50x. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I misread the cost function. Let me check again. The cost per unit is C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x². So, the fixed cost is 1000, and the variable cost is 0.01x². So that's correct.

So profit is correct at -0.01x² +50x -1000. But looking at the options, option A is P(x) = -0.01x² +30x -1000, which suggests a different x coefficient.

Hmm, maybe I should check the cost function again. Wait, perhaps the question is reversed? Maybe the cost per unit is C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x², which is the total cost, so yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the cost per unit is given as C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x². So, perhaps it's a quadratic cost function, so the correct profit function is as I derived.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, but assuming I'm correct, let's proceed. Let me consider that the correct profit is option A's P(x) = -0.01x² +50x -1000, but none of the other options have the correct x coefficient except perhaps option H, which has 50x and a different constant. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the cost function is C(x) =1000 +0.01x^2, which is the same as 1000 + 0.01x². So revenue is 50x. So profit is 50x - (1000 +0.01x²) = -0.01x² +50x -1000.

Looking back at the options, option A has 30x, which is different. Option H has 50x but a different constant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the profit function is being considered as revenue minus cost, but I might have missed something, but I can't think of another way. So perhaps I should proceed to the second part of the question and see if that helps.

Part (b) is asking for the value of x where profit is maximized. Since the profit function is a quadratic function of the form P(x) = ax² +bx +c, where a is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the maximum is at the vertex. The vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a).

In my case, a is -0.01, and b is 50. So x = -50/(2*(-0.01)) = -50 / (-0.02) = 2500.

So the profit is maximized at x=2500. Now, looking at the options, option C says x=2500. But I thought option A also had x=2500.

Wait, option A is x=1500, option C is x=2500, option H is x=1000. So if the correct x is 2500, then option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the profit function was -0.01x² +50x -1000, which gives a maximum at x=2500, so option C is correct.

But why is option A present? Option A's profit function is -0.01x² +30x -1000, which would have a maximum at x= -30/(2*(-0.01)) = 1500. So that's option A's x=1500.

Wait, so that suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, because option C is the correct x for profit maximization.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the profit function. Let me re-derive it. 

Revenue: R(x) = price per unit * number of units = 50 * x.

Cost: C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x².

Profit: P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 50x - (1000 + 0.01x²) = -0.01x² +50x -1000.

So the profit function is correct as option A has 50x, but the other options have different coefficients.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A has 30x, which would come from a different setup. So perhaps I made a mistake in the revenue.

Wait, perhaps I overlooked something in the problem statement. Let me read it again: 

"The price of a product p is $50. The cost per unit is C(x) =1000 +0.01x², where x is the number of units produced and C(x) is in dollars."

So the revenue is 50x. So the setup is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that would have a different x value for the maximum. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have a different cost function, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if I consider that perhaps the units are priced at $50 each, but the cost per unit is 0.01x², so the total cost would be 1000 (fixed cost) + 0.01x² (variable cost). So that's correct.

So the profit is 50x - (1000 +0.01x²) = -0.01x² +50x -1000.

Looking at the options, that's option A's profit function, which is -0.01x² +30x -1000. Hmm, but the x coefficient is 30, which doesn't match. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but I have to choose the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed to part (b) and see what the correct answer would be.

Wait, part (b) says, at what value of x is profit maximized? So I can use the formula x = -b/(2a). For my profit function, a is -0.01, b is 50.

So x = -50/(2*(-0.01)) = -50 / (-0.02) = 2500. So x=2500.

Looking at the options, option C is P(x)= -0.01x² +50x -1000, x=2500. So the correct answer for part (b) is x=2500, which is option C. So the correct options are (a) P(x)= -0.01x² +50x -1000, and (b) x=2500.

But looking back, the options for (a) are A and H. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, but in reality, my calculation is correct.

Wait, looking at option H, the profit function is P(x)= -0.005x² +50x -500. So a=-0.005, b=50. So x= -50/(2*(-0.005))= -50 / (-0.01) = 5000. So option H's maximum is at x=5000.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the maximum is at x=2500, so option C is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the revenue calculation. Let me think again. If the cost per unit is 0.01x², then the fixed cost is 1000, so the total cost is 1000 +0.01x². So revenue is 50x. So profit is 50x - (1000 +0.01x²) = -0.01x² +50x -1000.

So option A's P(x) has 50x and -1000, so that's correct. But the x value is 1500, not 2500. But according to the calculation, the maximum is at 2500.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but the options are conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the cost per unit is C(x)=1000 +0.01x^2, but the revenue is not 50x, but 50 times the number of units. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about marginal cost and marginal revenue, but that's for maximizing profit by setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost. But that's a different approach. Let me see.

Marginal cost is the derivative of cost with respect to x. So dC/dx = 0.02x.

Marginal revenue is the derivative of revenue, which is dR/dx = 50.

Setting them equal: 0.02x = 50 → x=50/0.02 = 2500. So again, x=2500.

So that's confirming that the profit is maximized at x=2500.

So looking at the options, the profit function is option A, which is correct because its x coefficient is 50 and the constant term is -1000. The maximum x is 2500, which is option C. So the correct answer for part (a) is option A, and part (b) is option C.

Wait, but the options for (a) are A and H, which have x coefficients of 50 and 50 respectively. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is option C for part (b).
