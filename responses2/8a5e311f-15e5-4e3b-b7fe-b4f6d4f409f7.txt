Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. Alright, an electric iron with a resistance of 24 ohms is connected to a 120-volt line. I need to find the power being used. The options are from A to J, all in different watt values.

Hmm, I remember something about power in circuits. Oh right, power can be calculated using the formula P equals V squared over R. Or wait, another way is P equals I squared R, but I don't think the current is given here. So maybe the first formula is better.

Wait, let me think about the steps. The voltage is 120 volts, and the resistance is 24 ohms. So using P = VÂ² / R should work. Let me plug in the numbers. V squared is 120 squared. 120 times 120 is 14,400. Then divide that by R, which is 24. So 14,400 divided by 24. Let me calculate that.

Hmm, 14,400 divided by 24. Let me see: 24 times 600 is 14,400. So 14,400 /24 is 600. So the power is 600 watts. Looking at the options, option A is 600 watts. So the answer must be A.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Oh right, power is also equal to current squared times resistance. But since I don't know the current, using V squared over R is the way to go. Another approach is to find the current first. Oh wait, V equals I R, so I equals V/R. So I would be 120 divided by 24, which is 5 amps. Then power is I squared times R. 5 squared is 25, times 24 is 600. Yep, same answer. So definitely 600 watts.

To determine the power used by the electric iron, we can use the formula \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), where \( V \) is the voltage and \( R \) is the resistance. 

Given:
- Voltage (\( V \)) = 120 volts
- Resistance (\( R \)) = 24 ohms

Substituting the values:
\[
P = \frac{120^2}{24} = \frac{14400}{24} = 600 \text{ watts}
\]

Thus, the power being used is 600 watts.

Answer: A
