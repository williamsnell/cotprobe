Okay, so I have this problem here: find the GCD of 25 and 55. Hmm, GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, right? I remember that the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that can divide both 25 and 55 evenly.

Let's think about the factors of each number. Starting with 25. The factors are numbers that multiply together to give 25. Well, 1 times 25 is 25, and 5 times 5 is 25. So the factors are 1, 5, and 25.

Now for 55. The factors of 55 would be 1, 5, 11, and 55. Because 5 times 11 is 55. So the factors are 1, 5, 11, 55.

Now, to find the GCD, I need to look for the common factors between both lists. Let's see: the factors of 25 are 1,5,25. The factors of 55 are 1,5,11,55. The common factors are 1 and 5. 

Out of these, the largest one is 5. So the GCD of 25 and 55 is 5. Let me cross-check that. 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 55 divided by 5 is 11. Both are whole numbers, so 5 is indeed a common divisor. Are there any larger numbers that divide both? Well, 10 doesn't divide 25 because 25 divided by 10 is 2.5, which isn't a whole number. Similarly, 11 divides 55 but not 25. So 5 is the correct answer.

The GCD of 25 and 55 is found by identifying their common factors. Factors of 25: 1, 5, 25. Factors of 55: 1, 5, 11, 55. The common factors are 1 and 5, with 5 being the greatest. Thus, the GCD is 5.

Answer: G: 5
