Question:

The rational-economic model of decision-making is based on the assumption that:

Options:

A: decision-makers can predict the outcome of their decisions with 100% accuracy.
B: individuals are better than groups at making decisions, especially under stressful conditions.
C: decision-makers place more emphasis on the costs of certain decisions than on other consequences of their decisions.
D: decision-makers will always choose the alternative that yields the greatest personal benefit.
E: decision-makers are incapable of making rational decisions due to cognitive limitations.
F: decision-makers’ knowledge about possible alternatives is always incomplete.
G: decision-makers prioritize the immediate benefits of a decision over its long-term consequences.
H: decision-makers often base their decisions on the opinions of others, rather than on a thorough analysis of the options.
I: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.
J: decision-makers are influenced by their emotions and personal biases when making decisions.

Okay, so I have this question about the rational-economic model of decision-making. Hmm, I remember that decision models are different from more human-like models. Let me think about what I learned in my economics class.

The question asks which assumption the model is based on. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Decision-makers can predict outcomes with 100% accuracy. That doesn't sound right. Rational models aren't about predicting outcomes perfectly; they're about maximizing value based on available information.

Option B: Individuals are better than groups at decisions under stress. That's more about collective behavior or groupthink. I don't think that's what a rational model assumes.

Option C: Emphasize costs over consequences. Wait, the rational model is about maximizing value, so maybe it's about considering the "marginal benefit per cost" or something like that. But does it say anything about prioritizing costs over other outcomes? I'm not sure, but I think it's more about considering both benefits and costs.

Option D: Always choose the alternative with the greatest personal benefit. That's too simplistic. People make decisions based on more than just the immediate benefit; sometimes they consider risks, long-term consequences, etc.

Option E: Can't make rational decisions due to cognitive limitations. That makes some sense. People have cognitive biases, so models assume they can't do perfect decisions.

Option F: Knowledge about alternatives is incomplete. I think the rational model assumes that people have some knowledge, but it's incomplete. So the model doesn't require perfect information but allows for uncertainty.

Option G: Prioritize immediate benefits over long-term. That's not what a rational model does. It focuses on the best possible outcome, considering both immediate and future benefits.

Option H: Base decisions on others' opinions. That's more of a group decision-making approach, not the rational model which focuses on individual analysis.

Option I: Base on others' opinions. Wait, no, that's H. Wait, I think I got it wrong earlier. Option I says decision-makers have complete info before making. So the model assumes they have information, but maybe incomplete.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The rational model, I think, is based on the assumption that decision-makers have information but not perfect, and they use that information to make decisions. So which option matches that?

Option E says they can't make rational decisions due to cognitive limitations. So the model doesn't require perfect information but relies on having some understanding.

Option F says knowledge is incomplete. So the model assumes that people have some knowledge but not complete.

Wait, the question is about what the model is based on. The rational model is based on the assumption that decision-makers have some information, but perhaps not perfect. So which option reflects that?

Wait, looking at the options:

Option G says prioritize immediate benefits. That's not part of the rational model; the model focuses on considering both immediate and future consequences.

So the correct assumption would be that decision-makers have incomplete knowledge. So the question is which option says that.

Wait, let me read the options again:

Option F: Decision-makers’ knowledge about alternatives is always incomplete. So the model assumes that they don't have complete info.

Option E: Decision-makers can't make rational decisions due to cognitive limitations. So they have some info, but can't handle it well.

So both E and F are possible. But the question is about the assumption the model is based on.

Wait, the rational model is more about considering all possible outcomes and their consequences, but not necessarily perfect. So the model doesn't require perfect information but relies on limited knowledge.

So the assumption is that decision-makers have incomplete knowledge. So the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but option G is about prioritizing immediate benefits, which is a different assumption.

Wait, the model's assumption is about the quality of information and the way decisions are made with that info. So the model doesn't require perfect information but assumes that decision-makers have some but not all. So the correct answer would be F.

Alternatively, the model might be that decision-makers assess all possible outcomes, but without perfect knowledge. So I think option F is correct.
</think>

The rational-economic model of decision-making is centered on the assumption that decision-makers have incomplete knowledge about alternatives. This means they do not possess perfect information but rely on their existing understanding to make decisions. 

**Answer:** F
