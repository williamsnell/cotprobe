Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about citric acid and pH. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. The question says that lemon juice has a pH of 2.1, and the only acid is citric acid. The dissociation constant (Ka) for citric acid is given as 8.4 × 10^-4. I need to find the concentration of citric acid in the lemon juice.

Wait, so citric acid is a diprotic acid, right? That means it can donate two protons. So the reaction steps are: HCit → H+ + Cit^- first, and then H+ + HCit → H2O + HCit^2-. 

But how do I model this when the pH is given? Oh right, the pH is 2.1, which is the concentration of H+ ions. So [H+] = 1e-2.1, which is approximately 7.94e-3 M. Maybe I need to use the acid dissociation to find the concentration.

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the only acid is citric acid, and no citrate salts are present. So I think that means that the solution is mostly undissociated citric acid, and not much of the ionized form. So the solution is in the acidic region, and the majority of the HCit is in its protonated form (H+) and the conjugate base (Cit^-).

But how do I relate the concentration of the acid to the pH? I remember the formula for the pH of a weak acid. For a monoprotic weak acid, the pH is given by pH = ½ (pKa - log C), where C is the concentration. But wait, is that correct for a weak acid?

Wait no, that formula is for a monoprotic acid when it's in its first dissociation. Let me think. The general formula for weak acids is pH = pKa - ½ log(C), but wait, maybe I'm mixing some concepts here.

Alternatively, the pH is determined by the first dissociation step. Since citric acid is diprotic and it's the first proton to lose, but if the pH is low, meaning that the solution is more acidic than the first dissociation. Let me think about the Ka.

The given Ka is 8.4e-4. So pKa is log(1/(8.4e-4)) = let's compute that. Wait no, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa = -log(8.4e-4) → log(8.4e-4) is 3.099 (since 1e-3 is 0.001, 8.4e-4 is 0.00084, which is lower. Let's calculate it more accurately.

log(8.4e-4) = log(8.4) + log(1e-4) = 0.9243 -4 = -3.0757. So pKa = 3.0757. Wait, no, because pKa is -log(Ka). Since Ka is 8.4e-4, log(8.4) is about 0.9243, so log(8.4e-4) is 0.9243 -4 → -3.0757. So pKa is 3.0757.

Wait another way, pKa is the negative log, so pKa = 3.0757. So approximately 3.08.

Now, the pH is 2.1, which is lower than the pKa. Oh, but wait, because the pH is lower than pKa, that would mean that the solution is more acidic than the first dissociation. Wait, but wait: for a diprotic acid, the first ionization is the main contributor to pH. So if the pH is lower than pKa, that suggests that the concentration of HCit is lower than what would be expected for a solution with pH higher than pKa.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again about the formula. For a weak acid, the pH is given by pH = pKa - (1/2) log(C), but that's when the acid is in its first dissociation, and the solution is more acidic than the first pKa.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The formula for the pH of a weak acid is pH = pKa - (1/2) log C. Wait, let's rederive it.

The dissociation is HCit ↔ H+ + HCit^-.

The expression for Ka is [H+][HCit^-]/[HCit] = Ka.

Assuming that [H+] ≈ [HCit^-], since the acid is weak. So [H+]^2 = Ka [HCit].

So [H+] = sqrt(Ka * [HCit]).

But pH is -log[H+], so pH = ½ (pKa) - (1/2) log [HCit].

Wait, that rearranges to pH = pKa - (1/2) log C.

Yes, that's correct. So pH = pKa - 0.5 log C.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. The pH is 2.1, pKa is 3.08. So, 2.1 = 3.08 - 0.5 log C.

Rearranging: 0.5 log C = 3.08 - 2.1 → 0.98.

So log C = 1.96. Therefore, C ≈ 10^1.96 ≈ 91.2e0 → approximately 9.1e1 M.

Wait, that's way higher than the given options. So either I made a mistake or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with the exact equation. Let me redo the equation.

pH = pKa - (1/2) log C → 2.1 = 3.0757 - (1/2) log C.

So 3.0757 - 2.1 = (1/2) log C → 0.9757 = (1/2) log C → log C = 1.9514 → C ≈ 8.9 × 1e1 → 89 M?

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps this formula applies only when the solution is in the region where the [H+] is much less than the first Ka (i.e., the solution is more acidic than the first pKa). So in this case, the pH is lower, so the formula would give us a concentration that's higher than expected for a solution with pH higher than pKa.

But the given options are all much lower than 89 M. So maybe I should use the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given problem involves the first dissociation, but maybe the assumption is that the solution is mostly the first ionization, so the concentration of HCit is lower than what this formula suggests.

Wait, another approach: since citric acid is a diprotic acid, the first ionization is more important than the second. So if the pH is 2.1, which is lower than pKa (3.0757), that means the concentration of HCit is much lower than the formula suggests.

Wait, perhaps the assumption is that the solution is mainly from the first dissociation, and the second is negligible. So using the formula for a diprotic acid, but considering only the first dissociation.

Wait, but the problem says that the only acid is citric acid, and no citrate salts are present. So the solution is mainly undissociated. So it's in the region where the solution is more acidic than the first pKa. So, the formula I used before, pH = pKa - (1/2) log C, should apply.

But that gives a concentration of ~9e1 M, which isn't among the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the problem using the formula for a diprotic acid. Let's think, the first dissociation is the main contributor.

The first dissociation equation: HCit ↔ H+ + HCit^-.

The equilibrium expression is Ka = [H+][HCit^-]/[HCit].

Assuming that the concentration of HCit is C, and that [H+] is much smaller than C (since pH is 2.1, which is high, so [H+] is about 1e-2.1 ≈ 7.9e-3 M.

Wait, but wait, if pH is 2.1, [H+] is about 7.94e-3 M. So in the first dissociation, [H+] ≈ [HCit^-], which is 7.94e-3 M. Then [HCit] is approximately C - [H+] ≈ C (since C is much larger than 7.9e-3).

So Ka = (7.94e-3)^2 / C → C = (7.94e-3)^2 / 8.4e-4.

Let me compute that. 7.94e-3 squared is approximately (7e-3)^2 = 49e-6, but more accurately, 7.94^2 is 63.0436. So (7.94e-3)^2 = 63.0436e-6 = 6.30436e-5.

Divide that by 8.4e-4: 6.30436e-5 / 8.4e-4 = (6.30436 / 840) → Wait, 6.30436e-5 is 0.00006304, and 8.4e-4 is 0.00084.

So 0.00006304 / 0.00084 = approx 0.075 M.

Wait, that's 7.5e-2 M. Looking at the options, option A is 7.5e-2 M. So that would be the concentration of HCit.

But wait, that's under the assumption that the second dissociation is negligible. Because if the solution is so acidic, the second dissociation may contribute, but in that case, the formula should account for both.

Hmm, but the problem states that no citrate salts are present. So perhaps the second ionization doesn't contribute, which would mean that the concentration is 7.5e-2 M, which is option A.

But wait, in the question, they say that the only acid is citric acid. So does that suggest that the second ionization is negligible? Or that the solution is more acidic than the first pKa, so the second ionization is not contributing significantly.

Wait, the first pKa is 3.0757. The pH is 2.1, which is lower than the pKa, meaning the solution is more acidic than the first dissociation. So the second ionization (H+ + HCit → H2C+ + HCit^2-) is the next step, but the solution is so acidic that the concentration of HCit is determined by the first ionization.

Wait, but if the pH is 2.1, then the concentration of HCit^- is about 7.94e-3 M, and the concentration of HCit is much higher. Let's compute:

Ka = (7.94e-3)^2 / C = 8.4e-4 → C = (7.94e-3)^2 / (8.4e-4)

Calculating: (7.94e-3)^2 = 6.304e-5 → 6.304e-5 / 8.4e-4 = approx 0.075 M.

So 0.075 M is 7.5e-2 M, which is option A.

But wait, the problem states that the only acid is citric acid. So the solution doesn't have any citrate ions, but the second dissociation would produce HCit^2-.

In the first dissociation, the concentration of HCit^- is 7.94e-3 M, and in the second, it's (assuming negligible contribution) much less.

So, given that the pH is 2.1, which is lower than the pKa of the first dissociation, this implies that the concentration of HCit^- is significant, and the concentration of HCit is much less because the second dissociation is negligible.

So the concentration of HCit is 7.5e-2 M, which is option A.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The problem says that the pH is 2.1, which is lower than the first pKa. So the solution is more acidic than the first dissociation. The second dissociation is the next step, but if the solution is so acidic, perhaps it's in a region where the second dissociation is less significant, but not negligible.

Wait, but the calculation using the first dissociation gives us a concentration of 7.5e-2 M, which is option A. But why is the first dissociation's pH (2.1) lower than pKa (3.0757)? Because the solution is more acidic, which would suggest that the concentration of HCit is lower than what the formula would suggest.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me correct my earlier calculation.

Wait, the formula I used was:

pH = pKa - (1/2) log C → 2.1 = 3.0757 - (1/2) log C.

So, (1/2) log C = 3.0757 - 2.1 = 0.9757 → log C = 1.9514 → C = 10^1.9514 ≈ 90.5 M.

But this gives a concentration of HCit as about 90.5 M, which is way higher than any of the given options. So this approach must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should model this using the acid dissociation for the first step, but including the second step as well. Because the problem says that the only acid is citric acid, but if the solution is so acidic, the second ionization may contribute a small amount, but the problem states that no citrate salts are present. So that suggests that the solution is mainly in the first dissociation.

But perhaps the problem is that the solution is so acidic that the second ionization isn't negligible, but the question says there are no citrate ions present. So maybe the second ionization isn't contributing significantly, but the first is the main factor.

Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach.

The problem gives the pH as 2.1, which is lower than the first pKa. So in the first dissociation, the [H+] is 1e-2.1 = 7.94e-3 M. So [H+] = [HCit^-] = 7.94e-3 M.

Using the dissociation equation:

Ka = [H+][HCit^-]/[HCit] = (7.94e-3)^2 / [HCit] = 8.4e-4.

So [HCit] = (7.94e-3)^2 / (8.4e-4) → let's compute that.

7.94e-3 squared is (7.94)^2 = 63.0436 → 63.0436e-6 = 6.30436e-5.

Divide by 8.4e-4 → 6.30436e-5 / 8.4e-4 = (6.30436 / 840) → because 8.4e-4 is 84e-5, so 6.30436e-5 / (8.4e-4) = (6.30436e-5) / (8.4e-4) = 0.075 M.

So [HCit] is 0.075 M → 7.5e-2 M, which is option A.

But in the problem statement, it says that the only acid is citric acid. So why is the second ionization not considered? Because if no citrate ions are present, then the second dissociation can't occur. So the concentration of HCit is indeed 7.5e-2 M, which is option A.

Wait, but why is the pH 2.1? It's lower than the first pKa, suggesting that the concentration of HCit is higher than what this formula suggests. But in this case, the problem states that the solution is in the acidic region relative to the first pKa, but since no conjugate base is present, the solution is mostly from the first dissociation. So the calculation I did (using the first dissociation) gives the correct concentration.

So the correct answer should be option A: 7.5 × 10^-2 M.

Wait, but looking at the other options, option H is 3.7e-4. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Let me recompute (7.94e-3)^2.

7.94e-3 is 0.00794.

0.00794 * 0.00794 = (7.94)^2 * (1e-4)^2 → 63.0436 * 1e-8 = 6.30436e-7? Wait, no, wait: 0.00794 is 7.94e-3, so (7.94e-3)^2 = (7.94)^2 * 1e-6 = 63.0436 * 1e-6 = 6.30436e-5.

Ah, so 6.30436e-5 / 8.4e-4 = (6.30436 / 840) → 6.30436 divided by 840. Let me compute that.

840 goes into 6.30436 how many times? Well 840 × 0.0075 = 6.3 → 0.0075 is 0.0075 as a decimal. So 6.30436 / 840 = 0.0075004... So approximately 0.0075.

So 7.5e-2 M gives the correct concentration when considering the first dissociation.

Thus, the correct answer is option A: 7.5 × 10^-2 M.
</think>

To determine the concentration of citric acid (HCit) in the solution, we use the given pH (2.1) and the dissociation constant \( K_a = 8.4 \times 10^{-4} \). The dissociation of citric acid is represented as:

\[
\text{HCit} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{HCit}^-.
\]

The relationship between pH, \( K_a \), and the concentration of citric acid is given by:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a - \frac{1}{2} \log C,
\]

where \( C \) is the concentration of citric acid. Rearranging for \( C \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \log C = \text{p}K_a - \text{pH}.
\]

Substituting \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(8.4 \times 10^{-4}) = 3.0757 \) and \( \text{pH} = 2.1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \log C = 3.0757 - 2.1 = 0.9757,
\]

\[
\log C = 1.9514,
\]

\[
C = 10^{1.9514} \approx 90.5 \, \text{M}.
\]

However, this result is inconsistent with the given options, which are all much lower than 90.5 M. To reconcile this, we focus on the first dissociation of citric acid, since the pH (2.1) is lower than the first \( \text{p}K_a \) (3.0757). Using the formula for weak acid dissociation:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{HCit}^-]}{[\text{HCit}]},
\]

where \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-2.1} \approx 7.94 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \), and \( [\text{HCit}^-] = [\text{H}^+] \approx 7.94 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \). Substituting \( K_a = 8.4 \times 10^{-4} \):

\[
8.4 \times 10^{-4} = \frac{(7.94 \times 10^{-3})^2}{[\text{HCit}]}.
\]

Solving for \( [\text{HCit}] \):

\[
[\text{HCit}] = \frac{(7.94 \times 10^{-3})^2}{8.4 \times 10^{-4}}.
\]

Calculating \( (7.94 \times 10^{-3})^2 \):

\[
(7.94)^2 = 63.0436 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (7.94 \times 10^{-3})^2 = 6.30436 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Dividing by \( 8.4 \times 10^{-4} \):

\[
[\text{HCit}] = \frac{6.30436 \times 10^{-5}}{8.4 \times 10^{-4}} = 0.075 \, \text{M} = 7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
\]

This result matches option A: \( 7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \). While the first \( \text{p}K_a \) suggests a higher concentration, the pH being lower than the first \( \text{p}K_a \) implies that the solution is primarily from the first dissociation, and the second dissociation is negligible. Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: A**
