Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about average total cost. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which statement is correct regarding average total cost (ATC). I remember that ATC is calculated by dividing total costs by the number of units produced. Let me write down what I know.

ATC = Total Costs / Number of Units Produced.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ATC = Total fixed costs + Total variable costs. Wait, that doesn't sound right. ATC is about the average per unit cost, not the sum. Fixed and variable costs add up to total costs, but ATC isn't the sum. So A is incorrect.

Option B: ATC = Total costs divided by marginal cost. Hmm, marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. ATC is about the average, so this seems off. The division here is wrong. B is incorrect.

Option C: ATC = Total variable costs / number of units. No, that's only part of the total costs. Because ATC includes fixed costs as well. So C is missing the fixed part. So C is wrong.

Option D: ATC = Total fixed costs / number of units. Wait, no. Because ATC includes both fixed and variable costs. So this would be only the fixed part divided by units. But ATC should include variable costs too. So D is incorrect.

Option E: ATC = Average variable cost + marginal cost. I'm not sure. Let me think. Average variable cost (AVC) is variable costs per unit. Marginal cost (MC) is the cost to produce one more unit. So adding them together would give the sum of the next unit's variable and marginal. How does that relate to ATC? Well, ATC includes all variable costs and fixed costs. If you add MC (which is the cost of the next unit) to the previous total (which is TVC), you get the new TVC. But ATC is TVC / n. Adding MC to TVC/n would not give you the correct ATC, unless the fixed costs are zero. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: ATC = Total revenue / number of units. No, that's the average revenue (AR), which is different. ATC is about costs, not revenue. So F is incorrect.

Option G: ATC = Marginal cost / number of units. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because marginal cost is the cost per additional unit, not an average. So if you divide marginal cost by the number of units, you're getting a rate per unit which doesn't add up correctly. G is incorrect.

Option H: ATC = Average variable cost + Average fixed cost. Oh, wait, that's right! Because ATC is the total cost divided by the number of units, which is (TVC + TFC)/n. So TVC/n is AVC, and TFC/n is AFC. So ATC is the sum of AVC and AFC. So H is correct.

Option I and J: I says ATC = average fixed cost minus average variable cost. That can't be right because ATC should be positive, and subtracting AFC (which is positive) from AVC (which could be less than AFC) would give a negative number. J is similar, but it's ATC = AFC / units, which is not correct because AFC is TFC/n, not (TFC)/units.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The correct answer is **H: Average total cost = average variable cost plus average fixed cost.**

This is because average total cost (ATC) is calculated as the total cost divided by the number of units produced. Total cost consists of average variable cost (AVC) multiplied by the number of units, and average fixed cost (AFC) multiplied by the number of units. Therefore, ATC = AVC + AFC. 

ANSWER: H
