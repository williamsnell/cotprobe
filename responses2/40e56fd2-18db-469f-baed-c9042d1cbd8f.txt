Question:

A businessman living was an avid baseball fan who frequently traveled to a casino and placed wagers on baseball games. One October, his beloved baseball team was playing in the playoffs and he wanted to place a large bet on his team. He told one of his employees that he wanted to bet $10,000 on his team to win the championship, but that he did not have the time to travel to the casino to place the bet. He then told his employee that he wanted the employee to travel to the casino and place the bet for him. The businessman and the employee agreed that the employee would travel to the casino, place a $10,000 bet for the businessman and then immediately return. In exchange, the employee would be paid $500. The parties reduced this agreement to writing. After the agreement was signed, the businessman handed the employee $10,000 and a round-trip airline ticket. The businessman then told the employee that he would be paid $500 after the employee returned. The employee arrived the next day and immediately went to the casino. There he noticed that the marquis in the parking lot was unlit and covered in a banner that read, "Casino Temporarily Closed Due to Renovations. " Unable to reach the businessman by telephone, the employee placed the bet at another gaming establishment located next door to the casino. The following morning, the employee flew back and gave the betting receipt to the businessman. When the businessman saw that the bet had been made at another gaming establishment, he angrily told the employee, "I purposely directed you to wager that $10,000 at the casino. Since you failed to follow my instructions, the deal's off. " As a result, the businessman refused to pay the employee the $500. If the employee initiates suit for breach of contract, the court will most likely determine that placing the $10,000 wager at the other gaming establishment, rather than at the casino, constituted a

Alright, let's try to figure out this legal question. So, the scenario is about a contract between a businessman and his employee. I need to determine what kind of breach occurred when the employee tried to do something the businessman didn't intend.

Okay, so the initial agreement was that the employee would travel to a casino, place a $10,000 bet for the businessman, and he'd return immediately. In exchange, the employee would get paid $500. But then the agreement was written, and the employee handed over $10,000 and a ticket. The businessman then told the employee that he would get paid $500 after returning. The employee went to the casino the next day because the marquis was unlit and the casino was closed. He placed the bet there instead.

So, the question is about the employee's breach when he chose the casino instead of the other establishment. I need to figure out what kind of contract clause this falls under. The options are about different types of contract breaches like material, constructive condition precedent, etc.

Let me think about the elements of a contract. A contract requires mutual consideration, clear and specific terms, offer and acceptance, and consideration. Also, the terms need to be binding and enforceable.

In this case, the initial arrangement was that the employee would go to the casino. But the employee didn't do that; he went to a different place. That's a breach. But the question is whether the breach is material or not, and what kind of condition or purpose prevented the employee from doing the required action.

Wait, the problem says that the employee initially told the businessman he would be paid $500 after returning. But the employee didn't do that. Instead, he went to the casino and placed the bet there. So, the employee was supposed to go to the casino, but he didn't. Instead, he went to another place.

The key here is whether the casino was a "constructive" condition precedent. Constructive condition precedent is when a promise includes a condition that must be fulfilled for the promise to be made. So, if the promise requires the promiseee to perform a certain action, and that action can't be performed without violating an implied condition, then the promise becomes enforceable only if that implied condition is fulfilled.

In this case, the contract was to go to the casino. The casino was closed, so the employee can't go there. But the employee didn't go there; he went to a different place. So, did the casino's closure create a condition that prevented the employee from fulfilling the promise? Or was it something else?

Wait, the initial agreement required the employee to go to the casino. The casino was closed, so the employee couldn't go there. But the employee chose another casino. So, the initial promise was to the one closed casino, but the employee wasn't allowed to go there because it was closed. So, maybe the initial promise is no longer enforceable because the implied condition of the casino being closed prevented the employee from fulfilling the promise.

Wait, but the contract was written, so maybe it's about whether the promise was broken because the implied condition wasn't met. For example, if the promise to go to the casino was a constructive condition precedent, and the employee didn't meet that condition (because the casino was closed), then the promise became unenforceable.

Alternatively, the employee's decision to go to the other place might have created a breach because the promise wasn't fulfilled as intended. So, the breach was material because the employee didn't perform the action required by the contract.

Wait, but the contract was written. Let me think about what the contract terms were. The employee was supposed to go to the casino, place the bet, and return. He didn't. Instead, he went to another place and got the bet. The business decided that the employee would get $500 after returning. But the employee didn't return. So, perhaps the contract didn't require the employee to return. The initial terms weren't clear about that.

Wait, the problem says the employee handed over $10k and a ticket. The businessman told the employee that he would pay $500 after the employee returned. The employee didn't return, so the $500 wasn't paid. He went to another place instead.

So, the employee didn't perform the promise to go to the casino and place the bet. Instead, he went to another place, thus breaking the contract. But the contract was to the casino. So, the breach would be on the part of the employee because he didn't go to the casino, even though the casino was closed.

But wait, the casino was closed. So, the promise was to go to a closed casino. So, the employee couldn't have gone there. So, the contract wasn't binding because the promise wasn't fulfilled. Or, the promise was broken because the condition wasn't met.

So, the breach is material because it was a clear breach of the contract. The contract required the employee to go to the casino. The employee didn't go there, so the promise wasn't made. The breach is material because it was a clear, specific condition.

Wait, but the initial agreement included the promise that the employee would return. So, the contract was that the employee would return. But the employee didn't. So, the breach is that the employee failed to return, which was a breach of the promise to return. But the promise to go to the casino was a constructive condition precedent that was not performed because the casino was closed.

So, the breach is on the employee's part because he didn't return, which is a breach of contract. The contract was that the employee would go to the casino, place the bet, and then return. The employee didn't return, so that's a breach. The issue is whether the promise to go to the casino was a constructive condition precedent that was performed or not.

Wait, the contract required the employee to go to the casino. The casino was closed. So, the promise to go to the casino was a constructive condition precedent. The employee didn't perform it because the casino was closed. So, the breach is on the part of the contract: the promise to go to the casino was broken because the condition wasn't met.

So, this would be a case of the promise being a constructive condition precedent that was performed. But wait, the problem is that the casino was closed. So, the condition wasn't met. So, the breach is because the promise to go to the casino wasn't performed.

Wait, but the promise to go to the casino was a part of the contract. So, the employee should have gone there. But he didn't. So, the breach is that the promise to go to the casino wasn't fulfilled.

So, the breach is on the part of the employee because he didn't perform the promise that he would go to the casino. The condition precedent was that the casino was closed, so the promise wasn't fulfilled.

Thus, the breach is a breach of condition precedent. But wait, the options include "discharge by impossibility" (A), "constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed" (B), "modification" (C), "material breach" (H), etc.

Wait, the question is about whether the breach was material and which type.

Wait, the employee's breach was that he didn't perform the promise to go to the casino. The initial promise was that the employee would go to the casino and place the bet. The casino was closed, so the promise wasn't made. So, the breach is material because it was a clear and specific promise that was broken.

But the employee's breach was that he didn't go to the casino. The contract required that. So, the breach is on the part of the employee. Since the promise to go to the casino was a condition precedent, the employee breached it.

So, the breach is a breach of a constructive condition precedent. So, the answer would be B.

Wait, but the options are A: discharge by impossibility, B: constructive condition precedent, C: modification, D: material breach, etc.

Wait, but let me think again. The contract was: employee would go to the casino, place the bet, return. Now, the employee went to another place and placed the bet. The contract wasn't about returning, so maybe the contract didn't require the employee to return. So, the employee didn't return, which was a breach.

But the original promise to the casino was a condition precedent. So, the employee didn't perform that condition. So, the breach is that he breached the condition precedent, making the promise unenforceable.

So, this is a breach of a constructive condition precedent. So, the employee violated the condition, making the promise invalid.

So, the answer would be B: constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.

Wait, but the employee didn't perform the condition, which was that the employee would go to the casino. So, he breached the condition. So, yes, it's a breach of a constructive condition precedent.

Wait, but wait, what's the difference between "substantially performed" and "did not perform"? The condition precedent is that the promiseee must perform it. So, the breach is on the part of the promiseee because he didn't perform it.

So, the breach is on the part of the employee because he didn't perform the condition precedent.

So, the answer is B: constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.

Wait, but option B is "constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed". So, the breach was because the promise to go to the casino was performed (substantially) because the condition precedent was met.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. The condition precedent is a promise that must be fulfilled for the promise to be performed. So, if the promiseee didn't perform the condition, the promise is broken.

In this case, the condition was to go to the casino. The employee didn't go there, so he breached that condition, making the promise unenforceable. So, the breach is due to the condition precedent being breached.

Hence, the breach is a breach of a constructive condition precedent. So, the answer is B.

Alternatively, considering that the contract required the employee to go to the casino, which is a constructive condition precedent. The employee didn't perform that condition, so he breached it.

So, the correct answer would be B.
</think>

The scenario involves a breach of contract where the employee failed to perform a condition precedent that was required by the contract. The initial agreement required the employee to go to a casino to place a bet and then return. However, the employee chose a different casino and failed to return, resulting in a breach.

The breach is material because it was a clear and specific promise that was broken. The condition precedent, which was the promise to go to the casino, was breached because the employee did not perform it. This breach occurred on the employee's part, as the promise to go to the casino was a constructive condition precedent that was not performed.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.**

ANSWER: B
