Okay, so I've got this question about Arthur's beliefs regarding certain values. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking which of the options A through D is a value Arthur believes is more fundamental than rights and desert. The options are justice, fairness, respect for other persons, and all of the above.

First, I need to understand what each option means. Let's see:

A: Justice. I remember that justice is about treating everyone equally and fairly, ensuring that no one is treated unfairly. It's about fairness and equality.

B: Fairness. Fairness is similar to justice but I think it might have a slightly different nuance. It's about being just in general, maybe not necessarily equal in all aspects.

C: Respect for other persons. Respect for others is about treating people fairly, whether they're rich, poor, or whatever, and not just about equality but also about treating others without discrimination.

D: All of the above. So this option suggests that all three are considered more fundamental than just rights and desert.

Wait, what's desert? I'm not exactly sure what desert means here. Maybe desert refers to the absence of rights, or perhaps it's a concept from certain philosophical or ethical theories. I'm not certain, but I think desert might relate to the absence of rights or the idea of equality being a fundamental principle.

The question is about Arthur's beliefs. The question is whether each of these values is more fundamental than rights and desert. So, are justice, fairness, and respect for others more important than just rights and desert?

Let me think about what each option represents. Justice and fairness are both about equality and fairness, which are part of rights. Respect for others is about treating others fairly, which is also part of fairness. So if desert is the absence of rights, then perhaps desert is the opposite of what these values represent.

So, if desert is the absence of rights, then values like justice, fairness, and respect for others are more fundamental than desert because they're about equality and fairness, which are more about rights and the absence of them.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what desert exactly is. Maybe desert isn't one of the options. Alternatively, maybe desert is a concept that Arthur considers as less important than the other values.

So, looking at the options again, the question is about which is more fundamental. So if all three (justice, fairness, respect for others) are more about equality and fairness, then they would each be more fundamental than desert, which is about the absence of rights.

So, the correct answer would be D: all of the above, because each of these is a value that's more fundamental than desert.

The correct answer is D: all of the above. 

**Explanation:**
- **Justice and Fairness**: These are more about equality and fairness, which are fundamental aspects of rights.
- **Respect for Other Persons**: This emphasizes treating others fairly, which is also related to fairness but focuses on equality among all individuals.
- **SD desert**: If desert refers to the absence of rights, then the other values are more fundamental as they represent equality and fairness, which are crucial for rights.

All three values (justice, fairness, respect for others) are more integral than desert, which is the absence of rights. Therefore, the correct choice is D: all of the above.

Answer: D
