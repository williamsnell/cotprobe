Question:

Okay, so I've got this problem here about restaurant tips in California. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about comparing the standard tip method and someone's method of tipping by doubling the sales tax. I need to find out by how many cents the person's tip exceeds the standard one on a $60 bill.

Wait, so the standard tip is 15% before tax. And someone is suggesting to double the sales tax, which is 8.25%. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll calculate the standard tip. 15% of $60. Let's see, 10% of 60 is 6, so 15% is 6 + (5% of 60), which is 3, so total 9 dollars. So standard tip is $9.

Now, the other method is doubling the sales tax. The sales tax here is 8.25%, so doubling that would be 16.5%. Wait, wait, no—wait, wait. Oh no, actually, I think I misread. The standard tip is 15% of the bill before tax. The alternative is to double the sales tax. So the sales tax is 8.25%, so doubling that would be 16.5%. Is that correct? Or wait, perhaps the tax is 8.25%, so doubling the tax amount would be 16.5% of the bill? Or is it 8.25% multiplied by 2? Like 8.25% times 2 is 16.5 percent. So yes, the tip is 16.5% of $60.

Wait, but wait another thing. Am I supposed to calculate the total bill including tax, or is the tip calculated before tax? Hmm, the question says "many people in California find the tip by doubling the sales tax, which is 8.25%." So probably the tip is 16.5% of the bill amount, which is $60.

Wait, but let me clarify. If the sales tax is 8.25%, the total bill including tax would be 60 + (60 * 0.0825). But the tip is calculated before tax. So the standard tip is 15% of $60, which is 9 dollars. The other method is to double the sales tax—so that would be 16.5%, so the tip is 16.5% of $60.

Let me compute both.

Standard tip: 15% of 60 is 0.15 * 60 = 9 dollars.

Method suggested: 16.5% of 60. Let me calculate that. 16.5% is 0.165. 0.165 * 60 = 9.9 dollars.

Wait, but wait, wait. Alternatively, someone could have doubled the tax, which would be 8.25 * 2 = 16.5%. But the tip is 16.5% of the bill. So 16.5% of 60 is 9.9 dollars. 

So the standard tip was $9, and the suggested tip is $9.9. The difference would be 0.9 dollars. But the question is by how many cents does the suggested tip exceed the standard. So 0.9 dollars is 90 cents. But wait, let me check my calculation again.

Wait, wait, 0.165 * 60. Let me compute 60 * 0.165. 60 * 0.1 is 6, 60 * 0.06 is 3.6, 60*0.005 is 0.3. Adding them up: 6 + 3.6 = 9.6, plus 0.3 makes 9.9. So yes, 9.9 dollars.

So the standard tip is 9 dollars, the suggested is 9.9. The difference is 0.9 dollars, which is 90 cents. So the answer is 90 cents, which is option B:90.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The tip is calculated as the tax doubled? So the tax is 8.25%, so doubled is 16.5%. So the tip is 16.5% of 60, which is 9.9. So that's 9 dollars plus 90 cents. So the tip is 9.9, which is 0.9 more than 9. So that's 90 cents. So the answer is 90 cents, which is option B.

The standard tip is 15% of $60, which is $9. Doubling the sales tax (8.25% becomes 16.5%) and applying this to a $60 bill gives a tip of $9.90. The difference is $0.90, which is 90 cents. Thus, the tip exceeds the standard by 90 cents.

Answer: B: 90
