Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about a segment of length 10, and points A and B are chosen randomly such that they divide the segment into three smaller parts. I need to find the probability that these three parts can form a triangle. The options are given from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I remember from my geometry class that for three lengths to form a triangle, they have to satisfy the triangle inequality. That means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, if the three lengths are x, y, and z, then x + y > z, x + z > y, and y + z > x. Since the total length is 10, x + y + z = 10. So, each of the sums of two sides must be greater than the third, which is the same as saying each side must be less than half of 10, because if one side is more than 5, then the sum of the other two would be less than 5, which doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality.

Wait, so each of the three segments must be less than 5. Because if any one is 5 or more, the other two can't add up to more than 5, which would make the triangle inequality fail. So, the probability we're looking for is the probability that all three segments are less than 5.

Now, how do we model the positions of points A and B? Since the points are chosen randomly along the segment, it's a uniform distribution. Let me think, the segment is of length 10, so let's model it as a line from 0 to 10. Points A and B are somewhere along this line. The lengths of the segments will depend on where A and B are.

It's often easier to model this by considering the positions of A and B as two random variables, say X and Y, uniformly distributed between 0 and 10. But since the order of A and B doesn't matter (because the segments are just the lengths between them), we can assume without loss of generality that X ≤ Y. That way, the segments would be X, Y - X, and 10 - Y.

But wait, actually, since the points are chosen randomly, the positions can be in any order. So, to account for all possibilities, perhaps it's better to parameterize the problem. Alternatively, we can fix one point and consider the other relative to it.

Let me approach it step by step.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose two points A and B on the segment. Since the points are chosen randomly, their positions can be anywhere along the 10-unit line. So, the pair (A, B) can be represented as a point in a square with sides of length 10. The area of this square is 100.

But since the order of A and B doesn't matter, we can consider the possible positions where A ≤ B, which would be a triangular region of area 50 in the square. So, the probability space is actually this triangular area.

Wait, no, the probability is calculated as the area where the condition is satisfied divided by the total area. But in this case, since the selection is uniform over the entire square, the probability is the area of the region where the triangle inequality is satisfied divided by the total area of the square.

Wait, but actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The problem is that the three segments must each be less than 5. So, the maximum length of any segment must be less than 5. So, we can model this with an interval of 10, and we need to select two points such that all three segments are less than 5.

So, let me model the problem: Let’s say the segment is from 0 to 10. Let’s pick two points, A and B, anywhere on this segment. The lengths of the three segments are X, Y, and Z, where X = min(A, B), Y = |A - B|, and Z = 10 - max(A, B). But wait, actually, if I model this as positions, then the three segments are |X - 0|, the distance between X and Y, and the distance from Y to 10.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem by considering two points, say X and Y, on the interval [0,10], and then the segments are X - 0, Y - X, and 10 - Y. But since X and Y can be in any order, we can assume without loss of generality that X ≤ Y, so the segments are X, Y - X, and 10 - Y.

But wait, no, that's not quite right because if X is less than Y, then the segments are X, Y - X, and 10 - Y. If Y is less than X, then the segments are Y, X - Y, and 10 - X. So, in either case, the segments are the differences between the ordered points and the endpoints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as selecting two points on the 10-unit segment, and then considering the three segments as the distances between these points. But I need to make sure that all three segments are less than 5.

Wait, another approach: The condition that all three segments are less than 5 can be translated to the requirement that the maximum length of any segment is less than 5. So, the maximum of X, Y - X, and 10 - Y must be less than 5.

But perhaps it's easier to consider the positions of A and B such that none of the segments exceeds 5.

Since the sum of the three segments is 10, if all three are less than 5, then each must be less than 5. So, for the maximum segment to be less than 5, the other two must sum to more than 5 because 10 - (max segment) must be greater than 5, but wait, that's not necessarily correct.

Wait, actually, if the maximum segment is less than 5, then the sum of the other two must be greater than 5 because the total is 10. Because, for example, if the maximum is 4, the sum of the other two is 6, which is more than 5. So, if the maximum is less than 5, the sum of the other two is more than 5. But does that help me?

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the positions. Let me consider the positions of A and B as x and y, where 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10. Then the lengths are x, y - x, and 10 - y.

We require that all three are less than 5. So:

x < 5,

y - x < 5,

10 - y < 5.

So, let's write these inequalities:

x < 5,

y - x < 5 → y < x +5,

10 - y <5 → y >5.

So, combining these, we have:

y >5,

x <5,

and y < x +5.

But since y >5 and y < x +5, and x <5, let's see what that implies.

Since x <5 and y >5, then x must be less than 5, and y must be greater than 5 but less than x +5.

So, let's substitute x <5 into the last inequality: y < x +5.

But since x <5, then y <5 +5 → y <10, which is already true because y is at most 10.

Wait, but y must be greater than 5, so 5 < y < x +5, and x <5.

This seems a bit tricky. Let me try to sketch this out in the x-y plane.

We have 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤10. The condition is 5 < y < x +5, and x <5.

So, for each x between 0 and5, y must be between 5 and x +5. But since y must also be ≥x, and since x <5, x +5 can be as high as 10, but y can't exceed 10.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express x in terms of the region. Let me consider x as the variable from 0 to5, and for each x, y ranges from max(x,5) to x +5. But wait, since x <5, x +5 can be up to 10, but y must be ≤10.

Wait, but let's think about the possible x. For each x, the minimum y is 5, and the maximum y is x +5. But since y can't exceed 10, we need to ensure that x +5 ≤10. Since x <5, x +5 <10.

So, for each x, the y ranges from 5 to x +5.

So, the area we're looking for is the integral over x from 0 to5 of (x +5 -5) dx, which is the integral of x dx from 0 to5.

Wait, because the width of y for each x is x +5 -5 =x.

So, the area is ∫(x) dx from 0 to5.

Which is [0.5 x²] from 0 to5 → 0.5*(25) = 12.5.

But wait, the total area of the triangle where 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤10 is (10*10)/2 =50. So, the area where all three segments are less than5 is 12.5?

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check.

Wait, the region where 5 < y <x +5 and x <5. Hmm, but when x is 0, y must be between5 and5 (since x+5=5), but y can't be greater than5. That seems contradictory. Wait, no, because when x is 0, y must be between5 and5, which is just y=5. But that's the boundary.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the integral. Let me think again.

If x is between0 and5, then y must be between5 and x +5. But since x is up to5, x +5 is up to10.

Wait, but when x is 0, y must be more than5 but less than5, which is impossible. So, perhaps x cannot be 0? Or maybe I'm misapplying the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the region where y >5 and y <x +5 and x <5 is a triangle with vertices at (0,5), (5,5), and (5,10). Because when x=0, y must be greater than5 but less than5, which is just 5, but for x approaching zero, y approaches5. Then, when x increases, y can go up to x +5.

Wait, let's plot this:

At x=0, y must be between5 and5, which is just y=5.

As x increases, y can go up to x +5.

So, the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,5), (5,5), and (5,10). Because when x=5, y can be up to 10.

Wait, but when x=5, y must be between5 and10. So, from x=0 (y=5) to x=5 (y=10), forming a triangle.

So, the area of this triangle is (base * height)/2. The base is 5 (from x=0 to x=5) and the height is 5 (from y=5 to y=10). So, area = (5 *5)/2 = 12.5.

Wait, so the area where the condition is satisfied is12.5, and the total area is50, so the probability is12.5 /50 = 0.25, which is25%.

But wait, when I thought about the integral, I had ∫x dx from0 to5, which was (5)^2/2 =12.5, so that's correct. So the area is12.5, and total area is50.

Therefore, the probability is12.5 /50 =0.25, which is25%. So, the answer is25%, which is option A.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the triangle inequality requires each segment to be less than5, but in this case, the area of the region where that happens is12.5, leading to a25% chance.

Wait, but the options have A as25%, which is what I'm getting. So, perhaps the answer is A:25%.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the area.

Wait, another approach: Let's model x and y as two points on [0,10], with x ≤ y. The three segments are x, y -x, and10 -y. We need x <5, y -x <5, and10 -y <5.

Which simplifies to x <5, y <x +5, and y >5.

So, the region is a triangle where x ranges from0 to5, and for each x, y ranges from5 tox +5.

As before, the area is the integral from0 to5 of (x +5 -5) dx = integral x dx from0 to5 → 0.5 * (5)^2 =12.5.

Total area is50, so probability is12.5/50=0.25, which is 25%.

So, the correct answer should be A:25%.

The problem involves determining the probability that three segments formed by two randomly chosen points on a 10-unit segment can form a triangle. For three lengths to form a triangle, each must be less than the sum of the other two (triangle inequality). Since the total length is 10, each segment must be less than 5. The valid region is a triangle with vertices at (0,5), (5,5), and (5,10), yielding an area of 12.5. Dividing by the total area of 50 gives a probability of 25%.
