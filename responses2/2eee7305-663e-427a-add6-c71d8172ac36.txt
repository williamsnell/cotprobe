Alright, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that events A, B, and C are mutually independent. I remember that mutual independence means that the occurrence of one event doesn't affect the probability of the others. So, if I want to find the probability that all three occur together, I can just multiply their individual probabilities. That makes sense because for independent events, P(A and B and C) is P(A) * P(B) * P(C). 

Given the probabilities: P(A) is 0.5, P(B) is 0.8, and P(C) is 0.9. So I just need to multiply these together. Let me compute 0.5 * 0.8 first. Hmm, 0.5 times 0.8 is 0.4. Then, multiply that result by P(C), which is 0.9. So 0.4 * 0.9. Let me calculate that: 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36. 

Wait, let me double-check. 0.5 * 0.8 is indeed 0.4. Then 0.4 * 0.9 is 0.36. Yeah, that seems right. So the probability that all three events occur is 0.36. Looking at the options, option I is 0.36. 

I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Since they're mutually independent, multiplying the probabilities is the correct approach. So the answer should be I: 0.36.

To find the probability that all three mutually independent events A, B, and C occur, we multiply their individual probabilities:

P(A and B and C) = P(A) * P(B) * P(C) = 0.5 * 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.36.

The correct answer is **0.36**, which corresponds to option **I**.

Answer: I: 0.36
