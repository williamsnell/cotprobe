This question refers to the following information.
Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
What traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?

Options:

A: That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies
B: That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation
C: That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts
D: That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about gunpowder Weaponry between Europe and China. The question is asking which traditional view of world history this passage challenges. Let me try to break this down.

First, I'll read the passage again. It says that during the 1200s to 1400s in Western Europe, early cannons were heavy and slow, and they were useful enough for the sieges that dominated the period. So they were paid for and used for experimentation, leading to gunpowder weapons that were more powerful and easier to move. That's great because it shows that Europe was innovative.

But then it contrasts with China. After the mid-1300s, China was threatened mainly by steppe nomads, who were mobile. Early gunpowder weapons were unwieldy, so they didn't help much. So China focused on improving horse archers to combat the dead-heavy foe, which made sense because horses could be moved more easily.

The question is about what traditional view this challenges. The options are A to D.

Let me look at each option.

Option A: That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies. Hmm. The passage says Europe was more advanced. So this might not be the correct answer because the passage suggests Europe was ahead.

Option B: That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation. The passage talks about China improving their military tactics, not suppressing. So this doesn't seem to match.

Option C: That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts. The passage doesn't mention anything about religion or fundamentalism. So probably not relevant here.

Option D: That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change. Wait, the passage says Europe used gunpowder to create more powerful and easier cannons, which might have helped them dominate. So if China didn't notice that, maybe it couldn't compete. But I know that Europe was more powerful than China historically, so I'm not sure if this is the right answer.

Wait, but the passage suggests that Europe was more advanced, leading to better technological advancements. So the passage is pointing out that China didn't exploit the benefits of gunpowder as thoroughly as Europe did. So the traditional view that China was behind Europe in this area is what the passage is challenging.

Wait, looking again at the options, D says China was surpassed because it turned a blind eye to the benefits. But if China didn't pay attention, maybe they didn't make the necessary technological improvements. But the passage indicates that Europe did make gunpowder weapons, which were more effective. So maybe the traditional view was that China was less advanced, and the passage is saying Europe was ahead. So the passage is challenging the idea that China was behind.

Wait, the passage says Europe was able to use gunpowder, which China didn't do. So the traditional view might have been that China didn't exploit the benefits of gunpowder as much as Europe did, leading to a relative decline in global power.

So the question is, what view does the passage challenge? The passage is showing that Europe's use of gunpowder, allowing them to be more advanced, whereas China didn't, so perhaps China was behind. So the traditional view that China was less advanced or didn't exploit gunpowder was challenged by the fact that Europe was more advanced.

Looking at the options, the question is about what traditional view this challenges. So the passage is suggesting that China didn't use gunpowder as effectively as Europe did, so the traditional view that China was behind but Europe was ahead was the one it's challenging.

So the options are:

A: China is less technologically adept. No, the passage shows Europe was better.

B: China's dictatorial rule. No.

C: Religious fundamentalism. No.

D: China surpassed Europe because it didn't notice the benefits. Hmm.

Wait, the passage says that China invested in horse archers, which allowed them to fight more effectively. Europe, through gunpowder, became more powerful. So the traditional view might have been that China's rigid rule and lack of technological innovation made them weaker. But the passage shows that Europe was ahead, so the traditional view that China was behind is being challenged.

Option D says China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to the benefits of gunpowder. But wait, the passage says Europe used gunpowder; China didn't. So the traditional view was that China didn't exploit gunpowder, thus being less advanced. But the passage shows that Europe did. So the passage is saying that China wasn't using the benefits, so the traditional view was correct. The passage is refuting the idea that China was less advanced.

Wait, no, the passage is about Europe being more advanced, so perhaps the passage is supporting the traditional view that Europe was ahead. But the question is which view the passage is challenging.

Wait, the passage says Europe was able to pay for their cannons and experiment, leading to gunpowder. China didn't invest as much, so their gunpowder was less effective. So the passage is presenting a case where Europe was more advanced, which contradicts the traditional view that China was behind.

So the passage is challenging the traditional view that China was behind Europe in technological advancement. So the correct answer is D?

Wait, the question is, what traditional view is this passage challenging? So the passage is showing that Europe was better, which would challenge the traditional view that China was behind.

Wait, the options are:

A: China is less technologically adept. No, the passage says Europe was better.

B: China's dictatorial rule suppressed innovation. The passage says China improved military tactics, not suppressed.

C: Religious issues. No.

D: China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to gunpowder benefits. Wait, the passage says Europe used gunpowder, China didn't. So it's the opposite. So the passage points out that China didn't make use of the benefits, so the traditional view that China was behind Europe is correct. Therefore, the passage is not challenging that view. Instead, it's supporting the idea that Europe was ahead.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

The passage says that during that period, Europe used gunpowder to create more powerful and easier cannons. China, on the other hand, didn't have gunpowder, and their cannonballs were unwieldy. So Europe was more advanced. The traditional view might have been that China hadn't capitalized on gunpowder as much as Europe did, so they were underdeveloped. The passage seems to contradict that, showing that Europe was the better model.

So the traditional view was that China wasn't as advanced as Europe. The passage's point is that Europe had a better technological system, so the traditional view was challenged.

Looking back at the options, D says that China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to the benefits of gunpowder. Wait, no, because the passage shows Europe did pay for their cannons. So the passage is showing that Europe was using gunpowder, which China didn't. So the passage is saying that China was not using the benefits, thus supporting the traditional view that China was behind.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about each option.

Option D says that China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to the benefits of gunpowder. But the passage says that Europe did pay for their cannons and developed gunpowder, while China didn't. So the passage is presenting a situation where Europe was more advanced because of gunpowder, not because China didn't notice.

So the passage is not challenging the idea that China was behind, but it is showing that Europe was ahead. Therefore, the traditional view that China was underdeveloped is being challenged, but the passage is supporting that view.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is, which traditional view does the passage challenge? So the passage is pointing out that Europe was a better example of technological advancement, which would challenge the idea that China was less advanced.

Looking at the options, option D says that China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to the benefits of gunpowder, which might not be correct. Because the passage says Europe used gunpowder. So the passage is not saying that, but the traditional view was that China was less advanced, so the passage is showing that Europe was better.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps it's better to go through the options.

Option D: That China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change. The passage says that Europe used gunpowder, whereas China didn't. So the passage is supporting the idea that Europe was ahead, which would mean the traditional view was correct. Therefore, the passage is not challenging the traditional view of China being less advanced.

Similarly, the passage is challenging the view that China was less advanced. So which option is about that?

Looking at the options, option D is not about that. Option A says China is less advanced. The passage is showing Europe was more advanced, so that doesn't challenge option A.

Wait, the question is asking which traditional view does the passage challenge. So the passage is showing that Europe used gunpowder, which China didn't, so the passage is the opposite of the traditional view. The traditional view was that China was behind, and the passage is showing Europe was ahead. So the passage is supporting the traditional view.

But the question is, which traditional view does the passage challenge? So perhaps the passage is not challenging it, but rather supporting the idea that Europe was ahead.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look again. The question is, the passage seems to challenge which traditional view.

If the passage is showing that Europe was more advanced because of gunpowder, then the traditional view of China being behind is correct. Therefore, the passage doesn’t challenge that. It’s supporting it.

Wait, maybe the passage is showing that Europe was a model of innovation, whereas China didn't make that. So the traditional view was that China hadn't capitalized on gunpowder, so the passage is showing that Europe was ahead, which would correct the traditional view that China was behind.

So the passage is challenging the traditional belief that China was less advanced. Therefore, the correct answer is D, but wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is suggesting that China didn't make use of gunpowder because they were too rigid, so the traditional view that China wasn't as advanced is challenged, because the passage shows Europe was more advanced.

So the passage is supporting the traditional view that China was behind, so it's not challenging it.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think in terms of the options.

The question is, what traditional view is this passage challenging.

The passage says that European cannons were heavy and slow but were paid for and experimentational, leading to gunpowder. China's cannons were unwieldy and not as useful, so they invested in horse archers instead. The passage suggests that Europe was more advanced.

So the passage is showing Europe was better, so it's not challenging the traditional view of China being less advanced. Instead, it's supporting the idea that Europe was ahead.

Therefore, the passage does not challenge the traditional view that China was behind Europe in technological advancement. So which option is about that?

Looking at the options again.

Option D says that China was surpassed by Europe because of a blind eye to gunpowder benefits. But it's the opposite: Europe used it, so the passage is supporting the traditional view.

So the passage is not challenging the traditional view. But the question is which it does challenge.

Wait, maybe I'm not seeing it. The passage is showing that Europe was a better model, so the traditional view that China was less advanced is correct. Therefore, the passage is supporting that view, not challenging it.

Hmm. Maybe the question is looking for the opposite. Let me think again.

If the passage is showing that China didn't use gunpowder as effectively as Europe, then the traditional view that China was underdeveloped is challenged. So the passage is pointing out that China didn't take advantage of a better technology, so the traditional view that China was behind is being challenged.

In that case, the passage is challenging the traditional view that China was less advanced. So which option is about that?

Option D says that China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to the benefits of gunpowder. Wait, no, the passage shows Europe did pay for their cannons, which China didn't. So the passage is not supporting the idea that China was underdeveloped.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to answer the question again.

The question is what traditional view is this passage challenging. It's about gunpowder Weaponry.

The passage states that Europe was able to experiment with gunpowder and pay for it, while China didn't invest in gunpowder and used their own cannonballs. So Europe's use of gunpowder suggests that they were more advanced.

The traditional view might have been that China hadn't capitalized on gunpowder as much, so they were less advanced. The passage is showing that Europe was more advanced, so the traditional view is correct. So the passage does not challenge that view.

But the question is which traditional view does the passage challenge. So perhaps the passage is the opposite of the traditional view. So the passage is presenting the opposite, so the traditional view was incorrect. Therefore, the passage is challenging the traditional view that China was behind.

In that case, the passage is the correct answer. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is presenting that Europe was more advanced, so the traditional view that China wasn't was challenged. So the correct answer is D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the passage is suggesting that China didn't use gunpowder, so the traditional view that China hadn't capitalized on it would be supported. Therefore, the passage is not challenging that.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is suggesting that Europe used gunpowder, so the traditional view that China hadn't been advanced enough is correct. Therefore, the passage is not challenging that view either.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the options again.

Option D says that China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to the benefits of gunpowder. But the passage shows Europe did pay for their cannons. So the passage contradicts the traditional view that China wasn't using gunpowder as effectively. So the passage is challenging the traditional view that China was behind.

So the answer would be D. Therefore, the passage is challenging the traditional view that China was underdeveloped.
</think>

The passage discusses the historical context of gunpowder Weaponry in Europe and China. During the 1200s–1400s, European cannons were heavy and slow but were experimentally paid for, leading to the development of gunpowder. In contrast, China faced unwieldy steppe nomads and invested in horse archers, not experimenting with gunpowder. This suggests that Europe was more technologically advanced than China.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This claims that China is less technologically adept than many Afro-Eurasian societies. However, the passage shows Europe was more advanced, so this does not challenge the traditional view.

- **Option B**: This states that China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed military or technological innovation. The passage focuses on the use of gunpowder, not dictatorial rule, so this does not apply.

- **Option C**: This suggests religious fundamentalism hindered modernization in China. The passage does not mention religious factors, so this is irrelevant.

- **Option D**: This claims that China was surpassed by Europe because it turned a blind eye to the benefits of gunpowder. The passage shows Europe used gunpowder, which China did not, indicating Europe was more advanced. This directly challenges the traditional view that China was less advanced.

The passage challenges the traditional view that China was underdeveloped by highlighting Europe's superior use of gunpowder, showing that China didn't capitalize on technological advancements effectively.
