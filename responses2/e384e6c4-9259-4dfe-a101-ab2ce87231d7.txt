Alright, I'm trying to find the remainder when 25^1059 is divided by 23. Hmm, okay, I think I should use modular arithmetic for this. Let's see, 25 mod 23 is 2, right? Because 23 times 1 is 23, and 25 minus 23 is 2. So 25 ≡ 2 mod 23.

So now the problem simplifies to finding 2^1059 mod 23. That's easier. I remember something about Fermat's Little Theorem, which says that if p is a prime and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 mod p. Since 23 is prime and 2 is not divisible by 23, Fermat applies here.

So, 2^22 ≡ 1 mod 23. That means the powers of 2 repeat every 22 exponents. So I can write 1059 as 22 times some number plus a remainder. Let's divide 1059 by 22.

Calculating 22 * 47 = 1034. Subtracting that from 1059 gives 25. So 1059 = 22*47 +25. So 2^1059 = (2^22)^47 * 2^25. Since 2^22 ≡1 mod23, this simplifies to 1^47 * 2^25 ≡ 2^25 mod23.

Now I need to compute 2^25 mod23. Instead of calculating 2^25 directly, which would be a huge number, I'll find a pattern or use exponentiation by squaring.

Let me compute the powers step by step:

2^1 = 2 mod23 → 2
2^2 = 4 →4
2^3=8→8
2^4=16→16
2^5=32→32-23=9→9
2^6=18→18
2^7=36→36-23=13→13
2^8=26→26-23=3→3
2^9=6→6
2^10=12→12
2^11=24→24-23=1→1
2^12=2^11 *2=1*2=2

Wait, at 2^11, I get 1 mod23. That's interesting. So 2^11 ≡1 mod23. That means every 11 exponents, the cycle repeats.

So, 2^11 ≡1. So 25 divided by 11 is 2 with a remainder of 3. So 25 = 11*2 +3. Therefore, 2^25 = (2^11)^2 * 2^3 ≡1^2 * 8 =8 mod23.

Wait, but earlier I thought 2^25 was 2^25 mod23. Let me check that again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Let me try another approach.

Another way: Since 2^11 ≡1, then 2^22 ≡1. So 2^1059 =2^(22*47 +25)= (2^22)^47 *2^25 ≡1^47 *2^25 ≡2^25.

Now, 25 mod 11 is 3, because 11*2=22, so 25-22=3. So 2^25 = (2^11)^2 *2^3 ≡1^2 *8=8 mod23.

Wait, but earlier when I computed 2^11, I thought 2^11 is 1 mod23. Let me verify that again.

Calculating 2^11:

2^1=2
2^2=4
2^3=8
2^4=16
2^5=32 →32-23=9
2^6=18
2^7=36 →36-23=13
2^8=26 →26-23=3
2^9=6
2^10=12
2^11=24 →24-23=1.

Yes, so 2^11=1 mod23. That's correct.

So, 2^25 = (2^11)^2 *2^3 → (1)^2 *8=8 mod23.

So the remainder is 8, which is option I.
