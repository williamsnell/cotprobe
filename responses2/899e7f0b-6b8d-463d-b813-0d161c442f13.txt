Question:

 Which of the following potentially morally relevant differences between Fred's behavior and the behavior of the consumers of factory-raised meat does Norcross not discuss?

Options:

A: Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, whereas the behavior of meat-eaters "merely" involves the suffering of chickens, pigs, cows, calves, sheep, and the like.
B: The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.
C: Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume.
D: none of the above

Okay, so I've got this question here about ethics and consumer behavior, specifically involving factory-raised meat. The question is asking which of the options doesn't discuss a morally relevant difference between Fred's behavior and the consumers of factory-raised meat.

Hmm, let's break it down. The question is about comparing Fred's actions with that of consumers who eat factory-raised meat. I need to find the option that doesn't address a potential moral difference.

The options are A, B, C, and D (which is "none of the above").

Looking at each option:

Option A: Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, whereas meat-eaters just deal with the suffering of animals. So, this is comparing the suffering experienced by the animals (puppies for Fred, animals for the meat-eaters). That seems like a moral difference because it's about the suffering of the animals. So A discusses a difference, so it's not the answer.

Option B: The suffering of puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, which I think refers to taste. Meanwhile, the suffering for meat-eaters is just a by-product of the economic conditions. So this is talking about the necessity of the sensory experience. That's a moral point because it's about the necessity of the pleasure. So B also discusses a difference, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Fred can prevent the suffering of puppies, but meat-eaters can't. So this is about whether the suffering can be controlled. It's a moral question about the ethical responsibility to prevent suffering. So C is a difference, so it's not the answer.

Option D: "None of the above." But since options A, B, and C each discuss a difference, D can't be the correct answer. Because the question is asking which option does NOT discuss a difference, and if all the others do, D is the only possible correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Did any option not touch on a moral difference?

Wait, I'm trying to remember if any of these points are about the ethics of the situation. Let me read each option carefully.

A: It's about the suffering of animals. So that's a moral consideration. So A is a difference.

B: The necessity of the suffering for pleasure. That's a moral consideration because it's about the value of the experience, not just the suffering. So B is a difference.

C: The ethical responsibility to prevent suffering. That's definitely a moral issue. So this is another difference.

So all options A, B, and C are about differences that relate to the moral implications. Only D says none of the above, which would be the correct answer if all options A, B, C discuss differences. So the correct answer must be D, as it's the only option that doesn't discuss a difference.
</think>

The correct answer is D: none of the above. 

**Explanation:** Each of the options A, B, and C discusses a potential moral difference between Fred's behavior and the consumption of factory-raised meat. These differences revolve around the suffering experienced by the animals, the necessity of sensory experiences, and the ethical responsibility to prevent suffering. However, since all options A, B, and C address these differences, the only option that does not discuss a morally relevant difference is D.

**Answer:** D
