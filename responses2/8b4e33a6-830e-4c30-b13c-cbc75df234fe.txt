Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about three contrasting explanations of anxiety. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me options A to J, each with three different theories or explanations. I need to figure out which three are correct and then pick the right letter from A to J.

First, I'll try to remember what each of these theories is about. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Psychoanalytic theory, social learning theory, and control theory. I'm pretty sure the psychoanalytic theory deals with unconscious thoughts and past experiences, social learning theory is about how we learn behaviors through observing others, and control theory is about how the body regulates internal conflicts. That sounds plausible.

Option B: Cognitive dissonance theory, behavioral perspective, and the diathesis-stress model. Cog dissonance is about feeling discomfort when internal conflicts arise. The behavioral perspective is more about observable behaviors, and the diathesis-stress model explains anxiety as a result of internal factors triggered by external stressors. That fits the idea of contrasting theories.

Option C: Psychoanalytic theory, stimulus-response theory, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Wait, Maslow's is more about the biological drive hierarchy, but I don't think it's a theory of anxiety. stimulus-response theory is more about conditioning and responses to stimuli, not about internal conflicts or stress. So maybe C isn't a correct theory for anxiety. Or perhaps the question includes this as a choice.

Option D: Fight or flight response, psychoanalytic theory, and control theory. Fight or flight is a biological response, and psychoanalytic deals with internal factors, while control theory is about body mechanisms. That makes sense as three distinct theories explaining anxiety.

Option E: Attachment theory, psychodynamic explanation, and behavioral genetics. Attachment theory focuses on family structures and bonding, psychodynamic on unconscious mind and emotions, and behavioral genetics on heredity and environment. All three are different frameworks, so this could be a correct trio.

Option F: Social learning theory, existential analysis, and the biomedical model. Social learning is about observing behavior, existential analysis is about free will and reality vs. illusion, and the biomedical model looks at genetics and environment. They're all different approaches, so F is a possible answer.

Option G: Psychoanalytic theory, stimulus-response explanation, and concepts of control and helplessness. Wait, the stimulus-response explanation is similar to E's behavior genetics, not the same as the biological perspective. Also, concepts of helplessness are more psychological than biological. So G might not be correct.

Option H: Cognitive-behavioral approach, humanistic perspective, and evolutionary psychology. The CB approach is a therapeutic method, humanistic is about personal growth and self-actualization, and evolutionary psychology looks at biology and environment influencing behavior. These are all distinct, so H could be correct.

Option I: Evolutionary psychology, biopsychosocial model, and the fight or flight response. Evolutionary psychology looks at heredity and environment, the biopsychosocial model combines biology, psychology, and social factors, and the fight flight is a biological response. These are different theories, so I is correct.

Option J: Biological perspective, cognitive theory, and existential analysis. Biological perspective is about genetics and environment, cognitive theory is about mental processes, and existential analysis is about free will and reality. These are all different, so J is a possible option.

Now, the question asks for three contrasting explanations. So each option presents three theories or explanations, and I need to pick the one where all three are indeed contrasting.

Looking back, which options have three theories that are all distinct and not overlapping?

Option A: All three are separate: psycho, social, and control. Seems okay.

Option D: Fight flight, psycho, and control. Not sure if they're distinct. Alternatively, perhaps they are.

Wait, but what about the other options. Let me see:

Option B: All three are different: cognitive dissonance, behavioral, and diathesis model. They are all distinct theories.

Option C: psycho, stimulus-response, and Maslow. Maslow is more about needs hierarchy, not about anxiety as a specific psychological construct. So perhaps C is not correct in that sense.

Option G: Concepts of helplessness are part of psychology, but I think it's more about psychological constructs than biological. So maybe G is not the best choice.

Option E: All three are distinct: attachment theory, psychodynamic, and behavioral genetics.

Option H: All are distinct: cognitive-behavioral approach, humanistic, and evolutionary. These are very different.

Option I: All are distinct: evolutionary psychology, biopsychosocial, and fight flight.

Option J: All are distinct: biological, cognitive, and existential.

Looking for which option has three theories that are entirely separate and not overlapping.

Option D: Fight flight is a biological response, psycho is about internal conflict, and control is about body mechanisms. But wait, is the fight flight considered a theory? No, it's a biological response. So D's theories may be biological and psychological, but are they all distinct?

Wait, the question is about three contrasting explanations. So each group should provide explanations that are different in their approaches. Let me check each option:

A: All three are different approaches, so this trio is a candidate.

B: All three are theories about anxiety. Yes, they're all distinct. So B is a possible trio.

C: Maslow is more about needs, not about anxiety. So this trio isn't correct.

D: Fight flight is a biological response, psycho is internal conflict, control is body response. These are all separate. So D is a possible trio.

E: All three are distinct theories. So E is a candidate.

F: Social learning, existential, biomedical. All are distinct.

G: Concepts of helplessness, which is psychological, may not be as distinct as others. Possibly not the best.

H: All three are distinct approaches, so H is a candidate.

I: All three are distinct: evolutionary, CB, and fight flight.

J: All three are distinct: biological, cognitive, existential.

So which options have three theories that are entirely different?

Looking for which option's three are not overlapping in their focus.

A: All are different approaches. So A is a correct trio.

D: Fight flight, psycho, control. Are these all different? Fight flight is a biological response, psycho is internal conflict, control is about body regulation. Yes, so D is a correct trio.

Wait, the question is about three contrasting explanations. So each group should have three theories that are distinct in their explanations.

Let me check each option:

Option A: All three are distinct approaches. So A is a correct trio.

Option B: All three theories are about anxiety, each explaining it in a different way. So B is a correct trio.

Option E: All three are distinct. So E is a correct trio.

Option I: All three distinct. So I is correct.

Option J: All three distinct. J is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking for three contrasting explanations. So each option is a group of three theories, and I need to pick which group is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question says "three contrasting explanations of the phenomenon of anxiety." So each of these options (A to J) lists three theories, and I need to choose the one where all three are correct and contrasting.

Now, which of these options correctly lists three contrasting theories about anxiety.

Let me think about each theory:

Option B: Cognitive dissonance, behavioral perspective, diathesis-stress model.

- Cognitive dissonance deals with decision-making and internal conflicts.
- Behavioral perspective looks at observable behaviors and reactions.
- Diathesis-stress is about how certain stimuli trigger internal stress.

These are three different theories, so B is a possible correct set.

Option E: Attachment theory, psychodynamic, behavioral genetics.

These are all distinct theories that address anxiety in different ways. So E is correct.

Option I: Evolutionary psychology, biopsychosocial, fight flight.

These are all different in their focus: evolutionary psychology looks at biology and heredity, biopsychosocial combines biology and psychology, and fight flight is a biological response. So I is a correct trio.

Option J: Biological perspective, cognitive theory, existential.

These are about biology, mental processes, and free will. So J is correct.

Wait, but the question asks for three contrasting explanations, so each of these options is a group of three explanations, and I need to pick the one that lists three theories that are all correct and distinct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Let me think why.

Because attachment theory, psychodynamic, and behavioral genetics all address anxiety in different ways. For example, attachment theory is more about family and bonding, psychodynamic looks at unconscious thoughts, and behavioral genetics looks at heredity and environment.

Alternatively, option B: Cognitive dissonance is about internal conflict, behavioral perspective is about observable behaviors, and diathesis-stress is the body's response to stress.

Another thought: perhaps the correct answer is E, as it includes theories about how anxiety is explained genetically, through biological processes, and through social structures.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about what each option says about the theories being 'constrasting' explanations.

Option A: Psycho, social, control. These are all distinct.

Option B: All three are different theories about anxiety, so they're contrasting.

Option D: Fight flight, psycho, and control. Fight flight is a biological response.

So if I have to choose, perhaps E is the best option because it includes theories that are more about biological explanations and different approaches.

Alternatively, thinking about each option, perhaps the correct trio is E. Because:

- Attachment theory (biological)
- Psychodynamic (unconscious mind)
- Behavioral genetics (heredity, environment)

These all address anxiety in different ways, so they contrast with each other.

Another angle: the options that have three explanations that are all distinct in their approaches are the correct ones.

Option B: All three are distinct theories. So B is correct. But I'm not sure if that's the correct trio.

Wait, the question is about why anxiety exists, so each theory explains it in a different way. So all three in an option are correct.

So for example, Option B includes cognitive dissonance (internal conflict), behavioral (observable behaviors), and diathesis-stress (internal stress triggers anxiety).

So each of these is a distinct theory about anxiety.

Thus, the trio in option B is a correct set of contrasting explanations.
