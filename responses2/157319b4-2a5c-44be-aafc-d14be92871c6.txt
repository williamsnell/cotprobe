Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the town's tax rate in Williamsville. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that the town requires $360,000 for educational purposes and $115,000 for health and welfare. The total assessed valuation of the property is $6,250,000. I need to find the tax rate per $100. 

Hmm, I remember that tax rates are usually calculated based on the assessed value. So I think the formula is something like tax rate = total tax needed / total assessed value. But wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right.

Wait, the town is collecting money for education and health, so I guess those are the two parts. So the total tax collected is 360k + 115k. Let me add those up. 360k is 360,000 and 115k is 115,000. Adding them together gives 475,000 dollars. 

So total tax needed is $475,000. The total assessed value is $6,250,000. So the tax rate per dollar would be 475,000 divided by 6,250,000. Let me calculate that. 

Wait, 475,000 divided by 6,250,000. Let me see, 6,250,000 is like 6.25 million. So 475,000 is 0.076 times 6.25 million. Because 0.076 *6,250,000 = 475,000. So that would make the tax rate 0.076 dollars per dollar. But the question asks for per $100. So I need to multiply 0.076 by 100, which gives 7.6 dollars per $100. 

Looking at the options, option E is $7.60 per $100. So the correct answer should be E. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. Another way: 475,000 divided by 6,250,000. Let me compute 475,000 divided by 6,250,000. 

I can simplify this fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 25,000 maybe? Let's see: 475,000 divided by 25,000 is 19, and 6,250,000 divided by 25,000 is 250. So now it's 19 divided by 250. 

19 divided by 250 is 0.076. So 0.076 per dollar, which is 7.6 per $100. Yep, that's the same result. So the answer is E.

The town's tax rate is calculated by dividing the total tax needed ($360,000 + $115,000 = $475,000) by the assessed valuation ($6,250,000). This gives a tax rate of $0.076 per dollar. Multiplying by $100 yields $7.60 per $100. 

Answer: E
