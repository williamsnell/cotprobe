Okay, so I've been given this chemistry problem about pH and percentage ionization. Hmm, I need to figure out which acid, when dissolved in water, gives the highest percentage ionization. The options are H2S, HNO2, HClO4, H3PO4, and H2CO3.

Wait, let's think about what I know. Percentage ionization is the percentage of the acid that has dissociated into ions. Higher percentage means it's more ionized. So which of these acids is the strongest or most fully ionized?

I remember that for acids, the strength can be determined by their acid dissociation constants (Ka). The higher the Ka, the stronger the acid and the more it will ionize. But wait, some of these are strong acids, like HClO4, which is a strong acid. Oh, wait, HClO4 is a strong acid, so it should have 100% ionization. But wait, wait, is HClO4 a strong acid? I thought HClO4 is a strong acid, but wait, wait, no, wait—no, wait, HClO4 is a strong acid. Because it's a diprotic acid, and the first dissociation is complete. But wait, wait, isn't HClO4 a strong acid? Or is it a very strong one?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. HClO4 is a strong acid, but wait, isn't it a very strong acid, stronger than any others in the options? Let me check the options again. The options include HClO4 (option C), which is a very strong acid.

Wait, but wait another thing. HClO4 is a strong acid, so it's a strong electrolyte, meaning it completely ionizes. That would have 100% ionization, which is the highest possible. So why is the question asking about the percentage ionization, implying that perhaps some of these are weak acids?

Wait, the options also include H3PO4 and H2CO3. Those are weak acids.

So HClO4 (option C) would have 100% ionization, which is the highest. But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each option.

Option A: H2S. It's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much. Percentage is low.

Option B: HNO2. Nitrous acid is a weak acid, so it's not very ionized.

Option D: H3PO4. Phosphoric acid. I think it is a weak acid, but not as strong as HClO4. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that H3PO4 is a weak acid, but maybe not as weak as some others. Alternatively, maybe it's a stronger acid than H2CO3.

Wait, H3PO4 has a Ka of about 7.5 x 10^-3 for the first dissociation. H2CO3 has a Ka of about 4.3 x 10^-7 for its first dissociation. So comparing the first dissociations, H3PO4 has a higher Ka than H2CO3, so it should be a stronger acid. So if H3PO4 has a higher Ka than H2CO3, it would have more ionization than H2CO3.

Wait, but if HClO4 has a higher Ka than all of them, then it would be the strongest, giving 100% ionization. But wait, can HClO4 actually dissociate completely? Or is that in the strong acid context?

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let's get my facts correct.

Strong acids are those that completely ionize in water. Strong acids include HCl (100%), HBr (100%), HNO3 (100%), H2SO4 (but only partially; wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but in solution, it's a diprotic acid. The first H+ is fully ionized, and the second H+ is only partially. Wait, but I'm getting confused.)

Wait, HClO4 is a strong acid, so when you dissolve it in water, it would dissociate completely. So, 100% ionization. That would make option C have 100% ionization.

But wait, wait another thing. Some of the other options might have higher Ka than some of the others. Let's compare.

HClO4: strong acid, Ka is very high.

H3PO4: Ka1 is about 7.5e-3, but the first dissociation is more than H2CO3's first (4.3e-7).

Wait, but HClO4 is a stronger acid than H3PO4. Because its Ka is higher. So HClO4 would have higher percentage ionization than H3PO4.

Wait, but then if HClO4 is a strong acid, why would the question have H3PO4 as an option? Because if it's a strong acid, it would have 100% ionization.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the strength in terms of their ability to fully ionize. So the highest Ka corresponds to the strongest acid, which would have the highest percentage ionization.

So let's list the acids and their Ka values:

A: H2S → pKa around 7. So it's a weak acid, low Ka.

B: HNO2 → pKa around 1.34. So, weak acid.

C: HClO4 → very strong acid. So Ka is very large.

D: H3PO4 → first Ka is ~7.5e-3.

E: H2CO3 → first Ka is ~4.3e-7.

So comparing the KAs:

HClO4 has a Ka of 1e12 or higher (exact value is 8.4e12?), which is way higher than all the others. So it's a stronger acid than H3PO4, H2CO3, HNO2, and H2S.

Wait, but wait, HClO4 is a strong acid, so it would have 100% ionization, so the percentage is 100%.

So the answer would be option C, HClO4.

But wait, wait, wait a second. Is HClO4 a strong acid? I thought HClO4 is a strong acid because it's a strong diprotic acid. So when you dissolve it in water, it completely ionizes into H+ and ClO4^-.

So, the percentage ionization is 100%, which is the highest possible. So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, what about H3PO4? Let me think, what's the Ka for H3PO4.

H3PO4 (triprotic) → first dissociation, H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-.

Ka1 is about 7.5e-3. So that's a moderately strong acid.

H2CO3 is carbonic acid. Its first dissociation is about 4.3e-7. So it's a weaker acid than HClO4 but stronger than H2S and HNO2.

So the order of strength (lowest to highest):

H2S (pKa ~7.0) < HNO2 (pKa ~1.34) < H2CO3 (pKa ~6.4) < H3PO4 (pKa ~2.2) < HClO4 (pKa ~-1). Wait, wait, no, pKa is negative for strong acids. HClO4 has pKa around -9, which is very strong.

Wait, no, wait, the pKa is the negative log of Ka. So a lower pKa means a higher Ka, stronger acid.

So HClO4 (pKa ~-1) is stronger than H3PO4 (pKa ~2.2) because -1 is lower than 2.2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the lower the pKa, the higher the Ka.

So HClO4 has a pKa of about -1.

H3PO4 has a pKa of about 2.2 (so Ka ~6e-3).

H2CO3 has a pKa of 6.4 (Ka ~3e-7).

HNO2 has a pKa of about 1.34 (Ka ~5e-10).

H2S has a pKa of about 7.0 (so Ka ~1e-7).

So the order of Ka from highest to lowest (strongest acid to weakest) is:

HClO4 (Ka ~8.4e12), H3PO4 (Ka ~7.5e-3), H2CO3 (Ka ~4.3e-7), HNO2 (Ka ~5e-10), H2S (Ka ~1e-7).

So HClO4 has the highest Ka, so it's the strongest acid, so it would have 100% ionization.

But wait, but wait, wait. Wait, isn't HClO4 a strong acid and a very strong one? So the percentage ionization would be 100%, which is the highest possible. So the answer is option C.

But wait, looking at the options again, the options have HClO4 as option C.

So the correct answer should be C.

To determine which acid, when dissolved in water, results in the highest percentage ionization, we analyze the strength of each acid based on its acid dissociation constant (Ka). The higher the Ka, the stronger the acid, and the greater its percentage ionization. Additionally, the percentage ionization approaches 100% for strong acids like HClO4, which completely dissociate in water.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: H₂S**  
   Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) is a weak acid with a pKa of approximately 7.0. It does not fully dissociate in water, resulting in a low percentage ionization.

2. **Option B: HNO₂**  
   Nitrous acid (HNO₂) is a weak acid with a pKa of approximately 1.34. It also does not fully dissociate in water, leading to a low percentage ionization.

3. **Option C: HClO₄**  
   Perchloric acid (HClO₄) is a very strong acid with a pKa of approximately -1. This means it completely dissociates in water, resulting in a 100% ionization. This is the strongest acid among the options.

4. **Option D: H₃PO₄**  
   Phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is a weak acid with a pKa of approximately 2.2. It does not fully dissociate in water, resulting in a lower percentage ionization compared to HClO₄.

5. **Option E: H₂CO₃**  
   Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) is a weak acid with a pKa of approximately 6.4. It does not fully dissociate in water, leading to a lower percentage ionization compared to HClO₄.

### Conclusion:
HClO₄ (Option C) is the strongest acid with a very high Ka, resulting in a 100% ionization. Therefore, it has the highest percentage ionization among the given options.
