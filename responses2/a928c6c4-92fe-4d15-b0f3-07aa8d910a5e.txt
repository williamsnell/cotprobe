Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct basic laws of Boolean algebra from the given options. Hmm, I remember that Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra where the variables have only two possible values, typically true (1) or false (0). The laws are essential for simplifying and manipulating Boolean expressions.

Let me recall the basic laws. There are a few key laws I remember. The first thing that comes to mind is the De Morgan's laws. They state that the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations, and vice versa. So, De Morgan's laws are ¬(A ∧ B) = ¬A ∨ ¬B and ¬(A ∨ B) = ¬A ∧ ¬B. Those are definitely part of the laws.

Then there's the distributive law, which I think says that AND distributes over OR and OR distributes over AND. So, A ∧ (B ∨ C) = (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) and A ∨ (B ∧ C) = (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C). That's part of the laws too.

Another important law is the complement law, which states that the complement of a complement returns the original value: ¬(¬A) = A. This is also known as the double negative law.

Wait, what about the law of identity? I think that's the law that says A ∧ A = A and A ∨ A = A. That's the identity elements for AND and OR operations.

Oh, right, the law of distribution is another term. Or is that distributive law? No, I think distributive law refers to how AND and OR distribute over each other, which I've already mentioned.

Wait, are there other laws? Oh, the absorption law. That's when A ∨ (A ∧ B) = A and A ∧ (A ∨ B) = A. These simplify expressions by absorbing one term into another. So, that's part of the laws.

And the identity law again: A ∧ 0 = 0, A ∨ 1 = 1, where 0 and 1 are the identity elements for AND and OR, respectively.

Hmm, wait, I think I also remember De Morgan's law being part of the laws. Let me check each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It lists Idempotent, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Law of Union, Law of Intersection, Double Negative Law or Involution Law, Law of complement and deMorgan's law. Wait, that's a lot. Wait, the 'Law of Intersection' doesn't ring a bell as a law. Plus, 'Law of Union' is a concept, but I'm not sure if it's a standard law. Also, 'Law of complement' is part of the laws, but distributive law is also a law. I'm a bit confused here.

Option B: It says only addition, multiplication, and complement. That's too narrow. I remember there are more laws like De Morgan's and distributive law.

Option C: Talks about scalar multiplication, vectors, etc. That doesn't sound right because Boolean algebra is about binary variables and operations, not vectors.

Option D: Associative, Distributive, Commutative, and Identity. But it's missing the law of complement and De Morgan's law, so it's incomplete.

Option E: Law of excluded middle, law of non-contradiction, law of identity. Wait, I'm not sure about these terms. Law of excluded middle is that a proposition is either true or false, which is a tautology. Law of non-contradiction is that a proposition cannot be both true and false at the same time. Oh wait, those are related to the laws of logic, but are they part of Boolean algebra? Hmm, I think Boolean algebra includes the law of idempotency, which is A ∧ A = A. Not sure about the others.

Option F: Idempotent, Non-Commutative, Associative, Exclusive OR. Wait, non-commutative and idempotent? Let me think. The commutative law is A ∧ B = B ∧ A, which is correct. Idempotent is A ∧ A = A. Exclusive OR is another operation, which is a form of OR with negation. So, I don't think this includes distributive law or De Morgan's law.

Option G: Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, Inverse. But the question is about the basic laws, not all laws. I think the basic laws are fewer, but this option includes more. Wait, the question is about the basic laws. So, commutative, associative, distributive, identity, and involution (which is the double negative law). So that's G's first five points.

Wait, but what about De Morgan's law? I'm not sure if it's included in G. Because G lists Involution, which is ¬A = A. Wait, no, the involution law is actually A = ¬¬A, which is the double negative. So G includes the double negative law under Involution. So G's items are commutative, associative, distributive, identity, and involution.

But what about De Morgan's law? I don't think it's listed in G. So perhaps the correct options are A or G.

Wait, maybe I should think again. The basic laws of Boolean algebra are: commutative, distributive, associative, identity, complement, and De Morgan's law. Or perhaps it's a subset.

Wait, let me list the laws I'm familiar with:

1. Commutative: A ∨ B = B ∨ A; A ∧ B = B ∧ A.

2. Associative: (A ∨ B) ∨ C = A ∨ (B ∨ C); (A ∧ B) ∧ C = A ∧ (B ∧ C).

3. Distributive: A ∨ (B ∧ C) = (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C); A ∧ (B ∨ C) = (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C).

4. Identity: A ∨ 0 = A; A ∧ 1 = A.

5. Complement (De Morgan's law): A ∨ ¬A = 1; A ∧ ¬A = 0.

6. Involution: A = ¬¬A (which is the double negative law).

Wait, but wait, the involution law is part of the laws. So, the basic laws include:

Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, Complement, Involution.

So, that's six laws. So, which option includes these?

Looking back at the options:

Option G: Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, Inverse.

Wait, Inverse is the same as the complement law. Because inverse is like the complement, but perhaps inverse refers to ¬A. So, G includes Com, Ass, Dist, Id, Inv.

So, that's the correct set of laws. So the correct option is G.

Other options don't list all of them. Option A includes a lot but might have incorrect terms. Option E includes some laws but not all, and others (like law of complement and De Morgan's) are not in E.

So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: The basic laws of Boolean algebra are Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, and Inverse.
