Question:

A collector owned a rare 16th-century tapestry. The collector contracted in writing to sell the tapestry to a tapestry dealer for $100,000. The contract stipulated that delivery would be "F. O. B. at the dealer's shop," with payment to be made one week after tender. When the dealer received the tapestry, he noticed that it had been damaged in transit. The dealer immediately contacted the collector and notified him that he was rejecting the tapestry because it had ripped apart and was becoming unwoven. The collector told the dealer that he would get back to him with re-shipping instructions. The collector did not make any further contact with the dealer. After four weeks, the dealer then sold the tapestry to a buyer for $120,000. If the collector sues the dealer for damages, the collector should recover

Options:

A: $20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.
B: $110,000, which includes a 10% penalty on the resale.
C: $100,000, which is the contract price.
D: $120,000, which is the resale price.
E: Nothing, because the dealer acted within his rights after the collector failed to respond.
F: $100,000, because the dealer is entitled to the contract price.
G: $20,000, for the loss of potential profit due to the damaged tapestry.
H: $120,000, for conversion.
I: $108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale.
J: $130,000, including the contract price and a penalty for unauthorized resale.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

So, there's a collector who owns a rare 16th-century tapestry. He contracted a dealer to sell it for $100,000. The contract specifies delivery with F.O.B. at the dealer's shop and payment one week after tender. 

Then, the dealer received the tapestry, noticed it was damaged. He immediately told the collector he was rejecting it because it was ripped and unwoven. The collector said he would ship instructions back once he gets a response. After four weeks, the dealer sold the tapestry to a buyer for $120,000.

The question is about how much the collector can recover if he sues the dealer for damages. The options are A through J, with letters as possible answers.

Hmm, I remember something about F.O.B. terms. F.O.B. stands for Free On Board, meaning the seller is responsible for the shipping costs and the buyer is responsible for the goods' damages. So, in this case, the dealer is responsible for the cost of shipping the damaged tapestry, and the collector is liable for any damages the dealer caused to the tapestry or the seller.

Wait, but in this scenario, the dealer rejected the tape because it was damaged. The collector didn't contact the dealer again, and the dealer sold it after four weeks. So, the dealer had to pay the collector for the damage. But the contract had a payment term of one week after tender. So, the dealer got the tape four weeks after the contract was entered into. Did that time frame affect anything?

Let me think about the contract terms again. The delivery is F.O.B., so the dealer is responsible for the shipping. The contract allows payment one week after tender, which I think is the date of delivery. So, the dealer must pay the $100,000 by the time the delivery arrives. But in this case, the dealer sold it after four weeks, which is more than a week. So, did the dealer have to pay the $100k, or could they have sold it without paying?

Wait, no. The contract specified that delivery would be F.O.B. when it arrives. But the payment is made one week after tender. So, the delivery date isn't included in the payment terms. That means the collector could have delayed payment, but since the contract didn't specify a payment date, the dealer might have to pay upon delivery.

But wait, the contract says delivery is F.O.B., not when it arrives. So, the dealer is responsible for the shipping costs, but the contract doesn't say anything about payment after delivery. So, the delivery date is when the goods are received by the dealer. But payment is due one week after tender, which I'm not sure what 'tender' refers to. Maybe 'tender' is the date of delivery. So, if the delivery was four weeks later, the dealer would have to pay after that.

Alternatively, maybe the payment is due when the goods are delivered, but the contract doesn't specify a payment date, so the dealer has to pay upon delivery. But in this case, the dealer sold it after four weeks (so 4 weeks after delivery? Because delivery is when it's F.O.B., and the contract says one week after tender. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me clarify. The contract's terms: delivery is F.O.B., meaning the seller (collector) is responsible for the shipping costs to the buyer (dealer). The payment is made one week after tender. "Tender" I think refers to delivery. So, delivery is when the goods are at the dealer's shop, and payment is due one week after that date.

In this scenario, the dealer received the tape after four weeks, which is more than a week. So, the dealer would have to pay the $100k when the goods arrive, but the contract doesn't say when the payment is due. So, the dealer is responsible for paying upon delivery. So, the contract doesn't specify a payment date, so the dealer is required to pay the $100k when the goods arrive, but the contract didn't say when. So, the dealer could have sold it without paying, but the contract didn't specify.

Alternatively, the contract might have required payment at delivery, but since it doesn't say, the dealer must pay upon delivery, which would be after four weeks. So, the dealer would have to pay $100k when the goods arrived, but the contract says payment is due one week after tender. So if the delivery was four weeks after tender, payment would be 5 weeks after delivery, which the dealer can't do.

Wait, that can't be right because the contract didn't specify a payment date. So the dealer must pay when the goods arrive, but the contract didn't say when. So the delivery was four weeks after tender, meaning four weeks after the contract was entered. But the contract didn't state a payment date. So, the dealer would have to pay when the goods arrived, which is after four weeks. But the contract didn't say the payment is due at that time. So the dealer is required to pay the $100k when the goods are delivered, but the contract doesn't state that.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract's payment term was that payment is due one week after tender, which I'm not sure. Maybe 'tender' is the date of delivery. So, the dealer is responsible for paying the $100k when the goods arrive, but the contract doesn't specify a payment date beyond the delivery date. So, when the goods are delivered, the dealer has to pay, but the contract doesn't say when. So, the dealer might have to pay upon delivery, but the contract doesn't specify a payment date. So, the dealer's liability is whether they can get the $100k when the goods arrive, but the contract's payment term is one week after delivery. So, if the delivery was four weeks after tender, the payment is due five weeks after delivery, but the dealer can't pay then. So, the dealer can't pay, but the contract doesn't require payment at that time. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the contract's payment term is one week after tender. So, perhaps the payment is due one week after the goods are delivered.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about when the contract is enforced. The contract's terms specify delivery at F.O.B., but payment is due one week after tender. 'Tender' could refer to delivery. So, if the goods are delivered, and the payment is due one week after delivery, then the payment is due 7 days after delivery. But if the goods were delivered four weeks after tender, the payment is due five weeks after the contract was entered into. So, the contract didn't set the payment date beyond delivery, so the contract requires payment upon delivery, but the payment is due then. But the contract didn't specify a payment date, so the dealer could have sold it without paying, but the contract doesn't require that.

Wait, but the contract says delivery is F.O.B., which the collector is liable for. So, the collector must pay for any damages the dealer caused because of the damaged tape. The dealer did reject it, and the collector didn't respond. The dealer then sold it at a higher price, $120k.

So, the collector's intent was to sell for $100k, but the dealer rejected it because it was damaged. The dealer is responsible for the damage, so the collector can recover from the dealer the difference between the contract price and what the dealer actually received. But wait, the contract didn't specify a payment date, so the dealer's liability is the difference between the contract price and the sale price.

Wait, but the contract's delivery term was F.O.B., and the payment is one week after tender. So the delivery date is when the goods are at the dealer's shop. But the contract didn't specify a delivery date, so the payment is due when? Maybe the contract didn't specify a payment date, so the dealer must pay when the goods are delivered. But the contract doesn't say so. Wait, no. The contract says delivery is F.O.B., which means the collector is responsible for shipping. But the payment is due one week after the goods are delivered? Or is it that the delivery is when it arrives, and the payment is due one week after delivery?

Wait, perhaps the payment is due one week after delivery. Because the contract states delivery is F.O.B., and payment is one week after tender. So, if the goods are delivered, the payment is due one week after delivery. But the contract didn't specify the payment date beyond delivery, so the dealer might be liable for the difference between the contract price and the actual sale price, but not for the payment, because the payment is due upon delivery. But the contract didn't specify whether payment is due at delivery or a week after.

This is getting complicated. Let me think about what the legal implications are.

If the contract requires payment one week after tender, and if the goods are delivered (F.O.B.), then the payment is due when they arrive. So, the payment is due 7 days after delivery. But the contract doesn't specify a payment date, so the dealer might be liable for any damages, including the difference between the contract price and the actual sale price.

Wait, but the collector didn't make any further contact, and the dealer sold the tape for more than the contract price. The contract price was $100k. The dealer sold it for $120k. But the contract's payment term says one week after tender. So, the payment is due when the goods arrive, which is four weeks after the contract was entered into. So, the dealer would have to pay the $100k when the goods arrived, but the contract didn't say when the payment is due. So, the dealer might be able to sell the tape at any time, but the contract's payment term is one week after the goods are delivered, which is four weeks after the contract was entered into.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me try to recap. The contract says delivery is F.O.B. The payment is one week after tender. So, the delivery is when the goods are at the dealer's shop, and one week after that is when payment is due.

So, if the goods are delivered four weeks after tender (delivery), the payment is due five weeks after the contract was entered into. But the contract doesn't specify that the payment is due at that time. So, the dealer must pay when the goods arrive, but the payment is due five weeks after the contract was entered into. Since the goods arrive four weeks after the contract, the dealer would have to pay the $100k upon delivery, but the contract doesn't require that payment at that time.

So, the dealer is liable for the difference between the contract price and the sale price, and also for the damages the collector incurred. Because the collector rejected the tape, the collector had to pay for the damages, which is the difference between the contract price and the actual price the dealer received. Wait, but the dealer sold it for more than the contract price. Or did he?

Wait, the contract says delivery is at the dealer's shop, and the payment is due one week after tender. The collector contracted to sell for $100k, but the dealer sold it for $120k. So, the contract's price is $100k, but the dealer sold it for $120k. But the contract didn't specify a price, just delivery and payment. So, perhaps the contract's price is irrelevant, because the delivery was at the dealer's shop, and payment is due one week after delivery.

Wait no, that's not right. The contract's price is just a nominal amount. Wait, no. The contract's price is the price the collector agreed to pay, which is $100k. But the dealer, knowing the tape was damaged, sold it for $120k. So, the dealer's sale price is $120k, which is higher than the contract price of $100k.

Wait, but the contract's payment term is one week after tender, which I think is the date of delivery. So, if the goods arrived four weeks after the contract, the payment is due five weeks after the contract was entered into. But the contract doesn't require the dealer to pay at that time. So, the dealer is liable for the difference between what the contract price was and the actual price he received, because the contract didn't specify a payment date beyond delivery. Or wait, perhaps the contract's payment term is only for that one week, but nothing beyond that.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract's payment term is that the delivery is F.O.B., and payment is due one week after tender. So, the delivery is when the goods arrive, and payment is due one week after that. So, the goods arrive four weeks after tender, so the payment is due five weeks later. But the dealer sold the goods for $120k, which is more than $100k. So, the dealer could have sold it for $120k, but the contract didn't specify that. So, the contract was for $100k, and the dealer sold it for $120k, but since the goods arrived after four weeks, perhaps the contract's payment term doesn't affect the dealer's liability.

Wait, but the contract's payment term is one week after tender, which is the date of delivery. So, if the goods are delivered four weeks after tender, the payment is due five weeks later. So, the dealer can't pay the $100k until then. But the dealer sold it for $120k, which is more than the contract price. So, the dealer may have sold it at a loss, but the contract didn't specify that. Wait, no, the contract didn't say anything about the price; the delivery is F.O.B., and payment is one week after tender. So, the contract's price is irrelevant unless it's a fixed price, which it isn't. So, the contract's price is just a nominal amount that the collector agreed to, and not a fixed amount. So, the dealer's sale price is $120k, which is more than the contract price of $100k.

So, the dealer could have sold the tape for $100k if the contract was for that price. But since the goods arrived four weeks after the contract, the dealer couldn't have paid the $100k yet. So, the dealer's liability is the difference between what the contract price was and the actual price the dealer received. But wait, the contract's price is $100k, but the delivery is in F.O.B., so the dealer is responsible for the shipping costs. So, the dealer may have had damages due to the damaged tape, which the collector had to pay. The collector, being the one who contracted, could have done this, but the dealer didn't pay the $100k because the contract didn't specify a payment date beyond delivery.

Wait, but the contract didn't say anything about payment after the goods were delivered. So, when the goods are delivered, the payment is due one week later. So, the dealer is liable for the difference between the contract price and the sale price. But since the goods arrived four weeks after the contract, the dealer can't pay the $100k until then. But the contract didn't say anything about payment then, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract's payment term is that the payment is due one week after the goods are delivered. So, if the goods arrived four weeks after tender, the payment is due five weeks later. But the dealer can't pay the $100k until then. So, the dealer is liable for the difference between the contract price and the sale price, because the contract didn't specify payment after delivery.

Wait, but the collector didn't make any further contact, so the dealer didn't get a response. So, the dealer's liability comes from the damage caused by the damaged tape, which the collector didn't pay for because the contract didn't require payment until the goods were delivered.

So, the collector's damages would be the difference between what he paid ($100k) and what the dealer actually received. But wait, the dealer sold the tape for $120k, which is more than the contract's price. So, the dealer's actual sale price is $120k, but the contract's price is $100k. So, the difference is $20k. But the contract's payment term is one week after tender, which is the date of delivery. So, the dealer can't pay the $100k until then because the goods arrived four weeks later.

Wait, but the contract didn't specify the payment date after delivery. So, the dealer might have to pay the $100k when the goods arrive, but the contract's payment term is one week after tender. So, if the goods are delivered four weeks after tender, the payment is due five weeks after tender. So, the dealer can't pay the $100k until then. But since the contract didn't require the payment at that time, the dealer is liable for the difference between what he sold for and the contract's price. Because the contract's price was $100k, but the dealer sold it for $120k, which is a profit. However, the contract didn't specify any penalties beyond the one week after tender. So, perhaps the collector's damages would be the difference between the contract price and the sale price, which is $20k.

So, looking back at the options, option A says $20k, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.

Alternatively, option G says $20k for the loss of potential profit due to the damaged tape. The loss of potential profit is the difference between what the contract price would have been (if the goods were delivered and payment was made) and the actual sale price. But wait, the contract's payment term is one week after tender. So, if the goods are delivered four weeks later, the payment is due five weeks after tender. So, the dealer can't pay the $100k because the goods arrived four weeks later, and the payment is due five weeks later. So, the dealer isn't liable for the difference between the contract's price and what he sold for, because the contract's payment term is one week after delivery, not one week after tender.

Wait, perhaps the contract's payment term is that payment is due one week after the goods are delivered. So, if the goods are delivered, and payment is due in one week, then the dealer would have to pay the $100k in one week after the goods arrived. But the goods arrived four weeks after tender, so the payment is due five weeks after tender. So, the dealer can't pay until then. But the contract didn't require payment at that time. So, the dealer is liable for the difference between the contract price and the actual sale price.

Alternatively, the contract's delivery date is the date of delivery, which is the date when the goods are at the dealer's shop. The payment is due one week after delivery. So, if the goods arrived four weeks after tender, the payment is due five weeks after tender, not five weeks after delivery. Wait, no. If delivery is four weeks after tender, then the payment is due five weeks after tender, which is one week after delivery. Because four weeks after tender is the same as five weeks after tender.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the terms as:

- The goods are delivered at the dealer's shop, which is four weeks after the contract was entered into.

- The payment is due one week after delivery, which would be five weeks after the contract was entered into.

So, the dealer can't pay the $100k until five weeks after the contract was entered into, but the goods arrived four weeks after the contract. So, the dealer can't pay the $100k until five weeks later, but the goods arrived four weeks after. So, the dealer would have to wait until five weeks after the contract was entered into to pay the $100k, but the goods arrived four weeks after. So, the dealer can't pay the $100k until then, but the goods are delivered four weeks after. So, the dealer is liable for any damages, including the difference between the contract price and the actual sale price.

Alternatively, the contract's delivery date is the date when the goods are at the dealer's shop, and the payment is due one week after delivery. So, the goods arrive four weeks after the contract, and the payment is due five weeks after the contract. The dealer can't pay the $100k until five weeks after the contract, but the goods arrived four weeks after. So, the dealer can't pay the $100k until then, but the goods arrived four weeks after. So, the dealer is liable for the difference between the contract price and the actual sale price.

So, the collector's damages would be the difference between the contract price and the actual sale price. But wait, the contract's price was $100k, and the actual sale price was $120k. So, the difference is $20k. So, the collector's damages would be $20k, which is option A.

Alternatively, the collector's damages would be the difference between the contract price and the price he actually had to pay. But since the goods arrived four weeks after, the payment is due five weeks after. So, the dealer can't pay the $100k until then, but the goods arrived four weeks after. So, the dealer is liable for the difference between the contract price and the actual sale price.

So, the answer would be option A: $20k.

But wait, the collector didn't have any damages because he didn't pay the $100k. The dealer's damages are the difference between what he sold for and the contract's price. But the contract's price is $100k, and the dealer sold it for $120k, which is higher. So, the dealer made a profit of $20k, but the contract's price was $100k. So, the difference is $20k. So, the collector's damages would be $20k, which is option A.

Wait, but the contract's payment term is one week after delivery, which doesn't affect the dealer's liability for damages. So, the collector's damages are the difference between the contract's price and the sale price, which is $20k. So, the answer is option A.
</think>

The collector contracted to sell the tape for $100k, but upon delivery, the goods arrived four weeks later. The dealer, knowing the tape was damaged, sold it for $120k, making a $20k profit. However, the contract's payment term was one week after delivery, which did not affect the dealer's liability for damages. The collector's damages are the difference between the contract's price and the actual sale price, which is $20k. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A. $20,000**
