Okay, so I just came across this math problem, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

The question says: A basketball player scored 18 points in his first game. This is 4 points fewer than he scored in his second game. We need to write an equation to find p, the number of points he scored in his second game. Then choose the correct option.

Hmm, so the first game he scored 18 points. The second game is 4 points more than that. Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says that 18 is 4 points fewer than the second game. So the second game is higher by 4 points. So if first game is 18, second is 18 + 4. But wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me make sure I get this right.

Wait, the first game he scored 18. That's 4 points fewer than the second game. So the second game is 4 points more than the first. So if first game is 18, second is 18 + 4 = 22. So p is 22. But let's look at the options to see which one matches this.

Looking at the options, I see option F: 18 + p = 4; 22. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if 18 + p =4, then p would be -14, which doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the equation setup.

Wait, let me think again. If 18 points is 4 fewer than the second game, then the second game is 18 +4. So p=22. So looking for an equation that leads to p=22.

Wait, looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option A: 18 = p - 4; 14. If 18 = p -4, then p=22. So this equation would yield p=22, which matches. So the equation is correct. The second part (14) is probably wrong, but the question says to select the correct equation, not necessarily the correct answer for p. Wait, the question is to write and solve an equation to find p. So maybe any equation that correctly represents the relationship is acceptable as long as it's correct.

Wait, but let's make sure. The equation is 18 = p -4. So solving for p, 18 +4 = p → p=22. So that's correct. So option A presents the equation correctly. The second part is 14, which is wrong. But the question is about the equation, not the correct answer. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options to see if any others also satisfy.

Option B: 18 - p =4; 22. Solving this: 18 - p=4 → p=14. But according to our earlier calculation, p should be 22. So this option would give p=14, which is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: 18 -4 = p; 14. So 18-4=14 → p=14. Again, that's wrong because p should be 22. So C is incorrect.

Option D: p = 18 -4; 14. So that would give p=14, which is wrong. So D is incorrect.

Option E: 18 =4 -p; 14. So 18 =4 -p → 18-4= -p → 14 =-p → p= -14. That's not correct. So E is wrong.

Option F: 18 +p =4; 22. 18+p=4 → p= -14. Again wrong.

Option G: 18 = p+4; 22. So 18 = p +4 → p=14. That's wrong.

Option H: 18 = p-4; 22. So 18 = p -4 → p=22. So this equation is correct, and the second part is 22, which is correct. So H is correct.

Wait, so both options A and H are correct equations. But the question says to select the correct equation, so both A and H are correct in their setup. But the problem is looking for an equation, and each option gives one equation and a possible answer. Wait, but the question is to write and solve an equation to find p. So any equation that correctly represents the relationship is acceptable, but the other part is given as options (the answer to p). So the correct equation would be one where p is 22.

So let's see. The equation in option A is 18 = p -4. Solving this gives p=22, which is correct. The equation in option H is 18 = p -4. So both equations are same, so perhaps the options are correct.

Wait, but looking back, the initial setup: first game is 18, which is 4 points fewer than the second. So second game is 18 +4=22. So p=22.

So the equation is 18 = p -4 (since 18 is 4 less than p). So equation is correct, and the answer p=22 is correct.

Looking at the options, both A and H are correct equations, but in reality, both are same equations. Wait, let me check each equation again.

Option A: 18 = p -4 → p=22. Correct.

Option H: 18 = p -4 → same. So both A and H are correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the user probably expects one correct answer. So perhaps the way the options are presented, each equation is presented with the correct answer. Let me check.

Wait, the options are presented as equations and then the answer for p. So if the correct equation is 18 = p -4, then the answer is 22. So which option includes this equation? Both A and H have that equation.

Wait, but looking at the options, maybe the question only expects one correct option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, alternative approach: The problem says that the first game is 18, which is 4 fewer than the second. So the second game is 18+4=22. So p=22.

So the equation is 18 = p -4. So the equation is in option A and H. So both equations are the same.

But the options may have multiple correct equations, but only one will match. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the equation in terms of the second game being 4 points more than the first. So 18 is 4 less than p, so p =18 +4 =22. So the equation is 18 = p -4. So that's correct.

So among the options, equations A, H would both correctly represent the relationship.

But perhaps the options are given as:

Option H: 18 = p -4; 22

So both equations are same. But perhaps the correct equation is one of the options. Wait, is there any other way to set up the equation?

Wait, another way: The first game is 18, which is 4 points fewer than the second. So second game is 18 +4=22. So the equation is 18 = p -4 → p=22.

So equation is 18 = p -4. So that's option A and H.

But in the options given, only one can be the correct one. So perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A. Because in option A, the equation is 18 = p -4, which gives p=22, which is correct.

Wait, but why would option H be presented as 18 = p -4? Because H is same as A. So if both are correct, but the question expects us to pick the correct equation, then both A and H would be correct. But in reality, perhaps only one of them is correct in the options.

Wait, perhaps the options are written with different equations. Let me check again.

Looking back, option A is 18 = p -4.

Option H is 18 = p -4.

So both are same. So perhaps the question is correct, but the options may have two same equations, but only one is correct. Or perhaps the answer is either A or H, but in reality, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is option A. Because option H seems to duplicate the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation as 18 = p -4 → p=22.

So equation is 18 = p -4 → so equation is correct.

So looking at the options, which one has this equation?

Option A: 18 = p -4; 14 → this would mean p=14, which is wrong.

Option H: 18 = p -4; 22 → correct equation and correct p.

But in the options, perhaps only option H is correct because it's presented differently. Wait, no. The options have both A and H as same equations.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is H, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the question only expects to write the equation, not the answer. But the problem says to find p, so the equation must lead to p=22.

So the correct equation is 18 = p -4, which is option A and H.

But in the options, only one can be selected. Wait, perhaps the options are not all correct, but the correct equation is A.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the equations in the options again.

The first equation in option A is 18 = p -4, which is correct.

Option H is the same equation, but presented as 18 = p -4.

Wait, perhaps the options are duplicated, but I need to select the correct equation.

But in reality, both A and H are same. So perhaps the correct answer is option H, because it's written as 18 = p -4, and the answer is 22, which is correct.

Wait, but in the options, each option presents an equation and then the correct p. So if option A is correct, that's one option. But the question is to choose the equation that correctly represents the relationship, which is 18 = p -4, and p=22.

So in the options, the correct equation is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is H, because both are same.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try again.

The first game: 18 points.

Second game: p points.

The first is 4 points fewer than the second. So 18 = p -4.

So equation is 18 = p -4 → which can be rewritten as p =18 +4=22.

So the equation is 18 = p -4, which is option A and H.

But in the options given, only one can be the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, because in option A, the equation is 18 = p -4, which is correct. The second part is 14, which is wrong, but the question is about the equation. So perhaps the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is H, but in reality, both are same.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H, because it's presented as 18 = p -4, and the p is 22.

So the correct option is H.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, as it is in the first part.

But I think the correct equation is 18 = p -4. So the correct option is either A or H.

But in the given options, perhaps only one option is correct, so I think the correct equation is option A.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is written in option A, and the other part is the answer. So the correct equation is A.

So the answer is option A.

The problem involves setting up an equation where the first game score (18) is 4 points less than the second game score (p). The equation derived is 18 = p - 4, which correctly represents the relationship. Solving this gives p = 22. Among the options, option A presents this equation correctly with the second part as 14 (which is incorrect). However, since the question asks for the correct equation, option A is the correct choice.
