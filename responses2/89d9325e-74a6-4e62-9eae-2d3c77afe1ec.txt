Alright, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me take a deep breath and think it through step by step. The question is about finding the probability of drawing a face card first and then an ace in two consecutive draws without replacement from a standard deck. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to remember what a standard deck has. There are 52 cards in total. Now, the face cards are Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. But wait, do Aces count as face cards? Oh, right! In some definitions, face cards are only Jack, Queen, and King, but sometimes Aces are included. I think this problem includes Aces as face cards, so that's 12 face cards in total: 3 per suit (Jack, Queen, King) and 4 Aces (one in each suit) makes 12. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me recount. Each suit has 13 cards, right? So J, Q, K are three face cards, and then the Ace is the 14th. So that's four face cards in each suit. Four suits, so 4 * 4 = 16 face cards? Wait, no, that's 4 suits, each with 4 face cards (J, Q, K, Ace). Wait, no, no. Wait, no, each suit has four cards: J, Q, K, and then the Ace. So 4 cards per suit, four suits. So 4 * 4 = 16 face cards. Wait, but that can't be right because normally, a standard deck has 12 face cards (3 per suit * 4 suits). Oh wait, wait. Maybe I'm mixing up the definition. Let me think again. Aces are considered face cards as well. So each suit has 13 cards, 12 of which are face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and one Ace. So 12 face cards in total. So that's 12.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. Each suit has 13 cards—12 being face cards (J, Q, K, and Ace). So 4 suits, that's 12 * 4 = 48 cards. Oh wait no, 4 suits, each with 13 cards. So 4*13=52. Yeah, that's right. So 48 cards are face cards? Or 12? Wait, no. Wait, 12 face cards per suit, 4 suits, so 12*4=48? No, wait that can't be right because 48 is more than half of 52. Wait, 13 per suit, 48 are not face cards. Wait, no: each suit has 13, of which 12 are face cards (3 each of J, Q, K, and the 1 for Ace). So 12 per suit, 4 suits: 12*4=48. So 48 face cards in the deck. Hmm, but that leads to a problem because the total number of face cards (including Aces) is 16? That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in a standard deck, each suit has 13 cards. The face cards are J, Q, K, and A. So that's four face cards per suit. So four suits, 4 face cards each: 4*4=16 face cards. Oh wait, that makes sense. So 16 face cards in total.

Wait, but I thought initially that face cards might include Aces. So in this problem, the first part is drawing a face card, which could include Aces. So the first draw is a face card (16 options), and the second draw is an Ace (but since it's without replacement, the number of Aces available depends on whether the first card was an Ace or not).

Wait, but the problem statement says "face card" and "ace". So in the first draw, it's a face card; in the second, an ace. So the second card has to be an ace. Now, I should consider whether the first card was an Ace or not, because that affects the number of aces left.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. First, determine the number of face cards in the deck: 16.
2. Then, determine the number of aces in the deck: 4.
3. The draws are without replacement, so after the first draw, the deck has 51 cards left.

The two events are: first, drawing a face card (16 options); second, drawing an ace from the remaining deck.

But wait, how many aces are left after the first draw? It depends on whether the first card was an Ace or not.

So, let's split this into two cases:

Case 1: The first card is an Ace. Then, the number of aces left is 3.

Case 2: The first card is a face card that's not an Ace. Then, the number of aces left is 4.

So the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each case.

Let me compute each case.

Case 1: First card is an Ace. There are 4 Aces in the deck. So the probability of drawing an Ace first is 4/52.

After drawing an Ace, there are 3 aces left in 51 remaining cards. So the probability of drawing an Ace on the second draw is 3/51.

So the combined probability for Case 1 is (4/52) * (3/51).

Case 2: First card is a face card that's not an Ace. There are 16 face cards in total, 4 of which are Aces. So 12 face cards are not Aces. So the probability of drawing a face card that's not an Ace is 12/52.

After drawing a face card that's not an Ace, the number of aces remains 4, and the total number of remaining cards is 51. So the probability of drawing an ace now is 4/51.

The combined probability for Case 2 is (12/52) * (4/51).

Now, the total probability is the sum of Case 1 and Case 2.

So let me compute each part.

Case 1:

4/52 * 3/51 = (4*3)/(52*51) = 12/(52*51)

Case 2:

12/52 * 4/51 = (12*4)/(52*51) = 48/(52*51)

Adding them together:

12 + 48 = 60.

So 60/(52*51).

Wait, but let's compute the denominator first: 52 *51= 2652.

So 60/2652. Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 60 ÷ 12 =5; 2652 ÷12=221. So 5/221.

Wait, but let me make sure I did the math right. So 4/52 is 1/13, and 3/51 is 1/17. 1/13 *1/17 =1/(221). And 12/52 is 3/13, 4/51 is 4/(51). 3/13 *4/51=12/(663) which simplifies to 4/221. So 1/221 + 4/221=5/221.

Wait, but wait, 4/52 is 1/13, 3/51 is 1/17. So 1/13 *1/17= 1/(221). 12/52 is 3/13, 4/51 is 4/51. So 3/13 *4/51= (3*4)/(13*51)=12/(663). 663 divided by 3 is 221, and 12 ÷3=4. So 4/221.

Adding the two: 1/221 +4/221=5/221. So the total probability is 5/221.

Looking at the options, option H is 3/220, option F is 1/110, option G is3/221, option I is5/221. So the correct answer is option I:5/221.
</think>

The probability is calculated by considering two cases: the first card is an Ace, and the second is an Ace; or the first is a non-Ace face card, and the second is an Ace. This results in a total probability of 5/221.

Answer: I:5 / 221

The answer is \boxed{I}.
