Question:

A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm where he scraped it on a tree branch 2 days ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (101°F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?

Options:

A: Disruption of vascular basement membranes
B: Decreased plasma protein concentration
C: Reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure
D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation
E: Reduced lymphatic drainage
F: Release of thromboxane
G: High blood pressure
H: Release of histamine
I: Separation of endothelial junctions
J: Increased hydrostatic pressure

Okay, so I've got this medical question here. Let's try to break it down. The patient is a 35-year-old man who's had his right arm scraped on a tree branch two days ago. He has pain and swelling. His temperature is 38.3°C, which is 101°F—so that's pretty hot, which I remember can mean high fever or maybe a heat stroke, but I'm not sure yet.

The exam shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion on the right forearm. Edema is swelling, which makes sense. And the area is extremely tender to palpation. So, the thing is, edema can happen due to various factors like trauma, inflammation, or certain metabolic diseases.

The question is about the primary mechanism of edema development. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one fits best.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: Disruption of vascular basement membranes. vascular basement membranes are layers of cells in the blood vessels. If they're broken, maybe that affects blood flow. But I'm not sure if that's the primary cause of edema.

Option B: Decreased plasma protein concentration. Pla proteins are part of the cell membranes. If they're low, maybe that affects the blood's ability to transport substances. But edema is more about swelling, not necessarily protein levels.

Option C: Reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid (like blood) in the vessel. If capillary pressure drops, it might cause collapse of the vessel, leading to edema. That sounds plausible.

Option D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation. Permeability means more fluid can pass through. If the area is more open, maybe edema would form because the blood can't get out. I remember inflammation can lead to increased vascularity.

Option E: Reduced lymphatic drainage. Lymph flow can affect edema, but I'm not so sure. If the lymph doesn't drain well, maybe edema isn't the main issue.

Option F: Release of thromboxane. Thromboxane is a hormone involved in inflammation. It might cause swelling and edema, but I'm not sure if it's the primary cause here.

Option G: High blood pressure. High BP can cause edema, but this was a tree branch, not a recent shock. Also, the man has a broken arm, so maybe it's more about tissue swelling rather than a systemic condition.

Option H: Release of histamine. Histamine can cause swelling, but again, not the first cause.

Option I: Separation of endothelial junctions. That's the area where the blood vessel wall meets the blood. If there's a problem there, like a defect in the endothelium, it can cause collapse of the vessel. That could lead to edema. But not sure if this is the main mechanism.

Option J: Increased hydrostatic pressure. If capillary pressure is high, the blood can't flow through. If the pressure drops, maybe the vessel collapses, leading to edema. So, this could be a possibility.

So, the question is about the primary mechanism. I've heard that inflammation and vascularity are key factors in edema. When you have a broken arm, it's likely the injury caused inflammation, which in turn caused vascularity changes. Increased capillary permeability (D) makes sense because inflammation leads to more capillary relaxation or relaxation of the walls, allowing more fluid to enter.

Wait, but sometimes, when you have inflammation, the capillary walls become more open, which would mean increased permeability. Or some inflammation might cause the basement membrane to collapse, leading to collapse of the vessel walls. Either way, both options C and D are possibilities.

Another thought: during the injury, the person's muscles are contracting, which could lead to inflammation. The injury might have caused the arm to heal, leading to more capillary activity. So, increased capillary permeability (D) might be the primary mechanism.

Alternatively, if the edema is around a lesion, maybe it's more related to the trauma causing the inflammation and then the breakdown of the structure. So, the main reason is the inflammation causing the increase in permeability.

So, putting it together, the most likely answer is D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation.

The patient's injury on a tree branch and the resulting edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion suggest a connection between the injury and systemic changes. The primary mechanism of edema development is most likely due to inflammation leading to increased capillary permeability, as inflammation often results in more open blood vessels and increased fluid movement. This aligns with option D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation.

Answer: D
