Okay, so I have this infinite series to solve: the sum from n=1 to infinity of 2 divided by (n squared plus 4n plus 3). Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with sums like this, especially ones that look like they could telescope, partial fractions might be the way to go.

First, I need to factor the denominator. The denominator is n² +4n +3. Let me try factoring that. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 3 and add up to 4. Oh, 1 and 3. So, the denominator factors into (n+1)(n+3).

So now, the expression becomes 2/[(n+1)(n+3)]. I think partial fractions can break this into two simpler fractions. Let me set it up: 2/[(n+1)(n+3)] = A/(n+1) + B/(n+3). 

To find A and B, I'll multiply both sides by (n+1)(n+3) to eliminate the denominators. That gives 2 = A(n+3) + B(n+1). Now, I can solve for A and B by choosing suitable values for n. 

Let me pick n = -3 first. Plugging that in: 2 = A(0) + B(-3 + 1) → 2 = B(-2) → so B = -1. 

Next, let me pick n = -1: 2 = A(-1 +3) + B(0) → 2 = A(2) → A = 1.

So, the partial fractions are 1/(n+1) - 1/(n+3). 

Now, the series becomes the sum from n=1 to infinity of [1/(n+1) - 1/(n+3)]. Let's write out the first few terms to see if there's a telescoping effect.

For n=1: 1/(2) - 1/(4)
n=2: 1/(3) - 1/(5)
n=3: 1/(4) - 1/(6)
n=4: 1/(5) - 1/(7)
n=5: 1/(6) - 1/(8)
And so on.

If I write out the partial sums, maybe I can see the pattern. Let's compute the partial sum up to some N and see what terms cancel.

The partial sum S_N = sum from n=1 to N of [1/(n+1) - 1/(n+3)].

Breaking it down:
Sum of 1/(n+1) from 1 to N: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(N+1)
Minus sum of 1/(n+3) from 1 to N: 1/4 + 1/5 + ... + 1/(N+3)

So, when subtracting, the terms from 1/4 to 1/(N+1) in the first sum will cancel with the corresponding terms in the second sum. That's because the second sum starts at 1/4 and goes up to 1/(N+3). So, the remaining terms are the first two terms of the first sum and the last two terms of the second sum.

Wait, let me write it more clearly:

S_N = [1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(N+1)] - [1/4 + 1/5 + ... + 1/(N+3)]

So the 1/4 to 1/(N+1) terms in both will cancel. So what's left is:

1/2 + 1/3 - 1/(N+2) - 1/(N+3)

Because in the first sum, after canceling, the last term is 1/(N+1), and the second sum's last term is 1/(N+3). So the remaining terms are the first two terms of the first sum (1/2 and 1/3) and the negative of the next two terms in the second sum (1/(N+2) and 1/(N+3)).

So, S_N = (1/2 + 1/3) - [1/(N+2) + 1/(N+3)]

Now, take the limit as N approaches infinity. The terms 1/(N+2) and 1/(N+3) will approach zero because as N grows, the denominator becomes very large, making the fractions very small.

So, the sum S = limit as N→∞ of S_N = (1/2 + 1/3) - 0 = (3/6 + 2/6) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333

Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Because 1/2 is 0.5, 1/3 is about 0.333..., so adding them gives about 0.8333. So, the sum converges to 5/6, which is approximately 0.8333.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.8333. So the answer should be E.

The sum is evaluated using partial fractions. The denominator factors as (n+1)(n+3), leading to partial fractions 1/(n+1) - 1/(n+3). The series telescopes, leaving 1/2 + 1/3, which equals 5/6 ≈ 0.8333. The correct answer is E.
