Okay, so I've got this problem about generators and their induced emf. Hmm, I remember that the basic formula for the induced emf in a generator is something like E = (P * φ * A * ω) / R, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact equation. Oh right, the generated emf depends on the number of turns in the coil, the magnetic flux per turn, the area of the coil, and the angular velocity of the coil, all divided by the resistance. 

Wait, but wait. Another way I heard it phrased is E = (N * Φ * A * ω) / R, where N is the number of turns, Φ is the magnetic flux per turn, A is the area, and ω is the angular speed. Or maybe that's when you're considering the induced emf. Alternatively, I think the formula can also be written in terms of the rotational speed. 

Wait, another thing: the induced emf in a generator is given by E = (P * φ * A * ω) / R. But I remember that when dealing with generators, the emf is proportional to the speed of rotation, because the speed affects the angular velocity. Oh right, because ω is 2πf, and f is the frequency, which is the rotational speed divided by 2π. So if the speed is higher, ω is higher, leading to a higher emf. 

But in this problem, the first part is when the speed is 1200 rpm, and the emf is 125 volts. Then, part (a) changes the field flux by 10% and keeps the speed the same. Part (b) changes the speed to 1100 rpm but leaves the flux the same. I need to find the new emfs in each case.

Wait, the field flux is the magnetic flux per turn. So in part (a), the field flux is decreased by 10%. So if I let the original flux be Φ, the new flux is 0.9Φ. But wait, wait, the problem says the field flux is decreased by 10%—does that mean it's 10% less than the original, so 0.9Φ? Or is it that the field flux is 10% of the original? Wait, the wording says "the field flux is decreased by 10 percent". So it's 10% less than before. So if the original flux is Φ, then it's 0.9Φ.

Now, but wait, the formula for the generated emf: when the speed is constant, the induced emf would be E = (P * Φ * A * ω) / R. So if we change the flux, that would change the emf, keeping other variables the same.

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't specify the number of turns, area, or resistance. So perhaps the induced emf depends on the product of those variables. So I need to find the ratio of the new emf to the original.

Wait, but in the problem, in part (a), the speed remains the same, so ω is same. The flux is decreased by 10%, so Φ is 0.9Φ. So the new emf would be E_new = (P * (0.9Φ) * A * ω ) / R. But the original E is (P * Φ * A * ω ) / R = 125 volts. So E_new = 0.9 * 125 = 112.5 volts. So part (a) is 112.5 volts.

Wait, but wait, wait. The formula I'm using assumes that all other variables are constant except for flux and speed. So yes, that logic holds.

Then part (b): speed is reduced to 1100 rpm, but flux remains the same. So speed is now (1100 / 1200) times the original speed. So the new angular velocity ω' = (1100 / 1200) * ω. So ω' = (11/12) ω.

But the induced emf depends on ω, so E_new = (P * Φ * A * ω') / R. Since Φ and A and R are constant, the new E is (11/12) * 125 volts. 125 * (11/12) = (125 *11)/12. 125 /12 is about 10.4167. 10.4167 *11 = 114.5833 volts. So approximately 114.58 volts.

Wait, but the options have part (b) as 104.2 volts. Oh, did I get a wrong assumption? Wait, maybe I should think again about the formula.

Wait, another possibility: the generated emf in a generator is given by E = (P * Φ * A * ω) / R. But perhaps this is when the generator is a long coil, and the flux is as such. Or perhaps that formula is for a shunt generator or something else. Maybe I should think in terms of the induced emf formula.

Wait, another approach: The generated emf E is proportional to the product of the speed, the magnetic flux, and the area, divided by the resistance. So, since the area and R are constant, and N (number of turns) is probably considered 1 for this problem, perhaps.

So E ∝ (speed) × (flux).

Wait, but the formula is E = (N φ A ω) / R, so E is proportional to φ, ω, and N, and inversely proportional to R. But since in the problem, N is not given, and R is not given, perhaps the problem is assuming that N and R are kept constant, so only the variables involved are flux and speed.

Wait, but if the problem doesn't specify N or R, perhaps they're considered to be the same in both parts, so N/R is 1. So for part (a), the flux is 0.9 Φ, speed is same, so E is 0.9 * 125 = 112.5. So that's part (a) done.

For part (b), speed is 1100 rpm, which is (1100/1200) = 11/12 of the original speed. Since E is proportional to speed, and flux is same, E_new is (11/12)*125 ≈ 114.58 volts. But looking at the options, I don't see that.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is (a) 112.5, (b) 114.6. So perhaps part (b) is 114.58, so 114.6 is the closest. So option I is correct for part (b).

Wait, but the options given include:

Option I: (a) 112.5, (b) 114.6.

So part (a) is 112.5, part (b) is 114.6.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the speed is reduced to 1100 rpm, so that's a 10% decrease. So the speed is 11/12 of the original speed. So the induced emf would be (11/12) * 125 = 125 * 0.916666... ≈ 114.58 volts.

Looking at the options, the closest is 114.6, which is option I's (b).

Wait, but the options are given as:

Looking at the options, option C is (a) 100 (no, I think). Wait, no, let's see the options again.

Wait the options are:

A: (a) 112.5, (b) 125

B: (a) 113, (b) 116

C: (a) 100, (b)115

D: (a)125, (b)104.2

E: (a)120, (b)109.1

F: (a)110, (b)120

G: (a)118.75, (b)108.3

H: (a)115, (b)110

I: (a) 112.5, (b) 114.6

J: (a)107.5, (b)117.5

So option I is (a)112.5 and (b)114.6.

But wait, so in part (b), if the speed is reduced to 1100 rpm, which is 55/60 of 1200, so 11/12 of the original speed. So if E is proportional to speed, then E_new = (11/12)*125 = 114.5833 volts, which is approximately 114.6 volts. So part (b) is 114.6, which is option I's (b).

But wait, the options for part (b) in the options are:

Looking back, the options are:

In the options for (a) it's 112.5, 113, 100, 118.75, 115, 107.5.

Wait, no, the option I says (a)112.5, (b)114.6. So that would match.

Wait, but earlier I thought part (a) is 112.5, part (b) is ~114.58, so 114.6 is correct. So the correct option would be I.

But wait, the options are:

Looking at the options given, option I is (a) 112.5, (b) 114.6.

So the answer would be option I.

Wait, but in the options there's option I: (a)112.5, (b)114.6. So that's the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the generated emf in a generator:

\[
E = \frac{P \cdot \phi \cdot A \cdot \omega}{R}
\]

where \(E\) is the induced emf, \(P\) is the number of turns, \(\phi\) is the magnetic flux per turn, \(A\) is the area of the coil, \(\omega\) is the angular velocity, and \(R\) is the resistance. The problem assumes that \(P\), \(A\), and \(R\) are constant, so \(E\) is proportional to \(\phi \cdot \omega\).

### Part (a): Field flux is decreased by 10%
- The field flux \(\phi\) is decreased by 10%, so the new flux is \(0.9\phi\).
- The speed remains unchanged, so \(\omega\) is the same.
- Since \(E \propto \phi \cdot \omega\), the new emf is:

\[
E_{\text{new}} = 0.9 \cdot 125 = 112.5 \, \text{volts}.
\]

### Part (b): Speed is reduced to 1,100 rpm
- The speed is reduced from 1,200 rpm to 1,100 rpm, which is \(\frac{11}{12}\) of the original speed.
- Since \(E \propto \omega\), the new emf is:

\[
E_{\text{new}} = \frac{11}{12} \cdot 125 = 125 \cdot 0.9167 \approx 114.58 \, \text{volts}.
\]

- This rounds to approximately 114.6 volts.

### Matching with Options
- For part (a), the correct value is \(112.5 \, \text{volts}\), which matches option (a).
- For part (b), the correct value is \(114.6 \, \text{volts}\), which matches option (b).

Thus, the correct choice is **option I: (a) 112.5 volts, (b) 114.6 volts**.
