B: 41%
C: 50%
D: 45%
E: 39.5%
F: 38%
G: 47.5%
H: 46.5%
I: 40%
J: 42.22%

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a store owner buying goods and marking them up. I need to figure out the markup percentage needed on the remaining purchases to maintain the desired 40% markup on the total. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the owner wants to buy $1,500 worth of goods. He has already purchased $200 worth of floor goods, which will sell for $250. So, the total purchase is $1,500, and he's already spent $200. That leaves him with $1,500 - $200 = $1,300 worth of other goods he needs to buy.

Now, he wants to mark up all these purchases by 40% based on the selling price. So, the markup is 40% on the selling price, not on the cost. That's important because markup calculations can vary based on whether they're on cost or selling price.

The floor goods sold for $250, and I think their cost would be lower because he marked them up. Let me calculate the cost price for the floor goods. Since markup is 40% on the selling price, the cost is 100% minus 40%, which is 60% of $250. So, 0.6 * 250 = $150. So the cost of the floor goods is $150.

He wants the total markup on all purchases to be 40% based on their selling prices. So, the total selling price of all goods should be calculated, and then the markup based on that.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the markup is 40% on the selling price. So, each item's selling price is its cost price plus 40% of that. So, for the floor goods: cost is $150, markup is 40% of 250, which is $100, so selling price is $250. Correct.

Now, let me think about the total. He bought $1,500 worth, but he already has $200 worth worth of goods. So, he needs to purchase another $1,300 worth. For each of these, he's going to mark them up 40% on their selling prices. Let me denote the total cost of the remaining goods as C, which is $1,300. But wait, no—wait, the total cost is $1,500, and he's already spent $200, so the remaining is $1,300. So, the cost of those is C = $1,300.

Now, the total selling price of all goods after markup should be the sum of the selling prices of each item. Since the markup is 40% on the selling price, for each item, selling price = cost + 40% of selling price. So, that can be rearranged to cost = selling price * (1 - 0.4) = 0.6 * selling price. So, selling price = cost / 0.6.

So, for the floor goods, selling price is $250, and cost is $150. For the other goods, each would have a selling price of (cost) / 0.6.

But wait, the total cost is $1,500. The floor goods cost $150, so the remaining goods cost $1,350 (since 1500-200=1350). So, their cost is $1,350 for the remaining purchases.

Therefore, the total selling price of the remaining goods would be (1350) / 0.6 = 2250.

Wait, let me check that. Because the markup is 40% on the selling price. So, for each item, the markup is 40% of the selling price. So, cost = selling price * 0.6.

So, the total cost is the sum of all items' costs. The floor goods cost $150, and the remaining goods cost $1,350. So, total cost is $1,500, as given.

The total selling price needs to have a 40% markup on each item. So, the total selling price (S) is such that cost = 0.6 * S. So, 1500 = 0.6 * S → S = 1500 / 0.6 = 2500.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Because if each item has a 40% markup on its selling price, then each item's cost is 60% of its selling price. So, total cost is 0.6*(sum of all selling prices). So, sum of selling prices = total cost / 0.6.

So, total cost is $1,500, so sum of selling prices = 1500 / 0.6 = 2500.

But he already has a selling price of $250 for the floor goods. So, the remaining selling prices should add up to 2500 - 250 = 2250.

Now, the remaining goods would be $1,300 worth, but their selling prices sum to 2250. So, the markup on these is 2250 - 1350 (since cost of these is $1,350) = 900. So, the markup percentage on the remaining is (900 / 1350) * 100 = 66.666...%, which is 66.67%. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The goal is to find the markup percentage on the remaining purchases, which is the markup needed on the $1,300 worth of goods (i.e., the remaining $1,300 in cost) such that the total markup on all items is 40% based on their selling prices.

Wait, no. Let me think again: the total markup is 40% of the total selling price. The total selling price is the sum of all items' selling prices.

But the floor goods are already sold for $250, so we can calculate their markup. Then, for the remaining goods, we can find what markup percentage is needed so that the total markup is 40% of the total selling price.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. The desired total markup is 40% of the total selling price. Let's denote the total selling price as S_total.

2. The desired total markup is 0.4 * S_total.

3. The floor goods contribute S_floors = $250, with markup of 40% on their selling price. So, their cost is $150, which is 60% of 250, as calculated earlier.

4. The remaining goods have a total cost of $1,350 (since total cost is $1,500, minus $200). Let's denote their selling price as S_remaining. So, their cost is 0.6 * S_remaining.

5. So, cost_remaining = 0.6 * S_remaining → S_remaining = cost_remaining / 0.6 = 1350 / 0.6 = 2250.

6. So, the total selling price S_total = S_floors + S_remaining = 250 + 2250 = 2500.

7. The desired total markup is 0.4 * 2500 = 1000.

8. The markup from the floor goods is 40% of 250, which is $100. So, their markup is $100.

9. Therefore, the markup needed from the remaining goods is 1000 - 100 = 900.

10. The cost of the remaining goods is $1,350, so the markup percentage is (900 / 1350) * 100 = approximately 66.666...% → 66.67%, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: The markup is calculated on the cost, but the desired markup is on the selling price. Or is it on the cost? The problem says 40% markup on the selling price. So, the markup is 40% of the selling price.

So, for the remaining goods, each is sold at a price that gives a 40% markup. So, their cost is 60% of their selling price.

So, for the remaining goods:

Total cost = 1,350.

Each item's cost is 0.6 * S_i, where S_i is the selling price of each item.

Total cost is sum of 0.6 * S_i for all remaining items, so sum(S_i) = total_cost / 0.6 = 1350 / 0.6 = 2250.

Total selling price is 2250 + 250 = 2500.

Desired total markup is 0.4 * 2500 = 1000.

But the floor goods contribute a markup of 0.4 * 250 = 100. So, the remaining goods need to contribute 900 as markup.

The markup from remaining goods is 900, which is 900 / 1350 = 0.666..., which is 66.666...%. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the markup as a percentage of the cost, not the selling price. Let me reread the question.

The question says: "desired 40% markup on the total purchase." So, perhaps the markup is based on the total cost, not the selling price. So, the total markup is 40% of the total cost.

Wait, that would be a different approach. Let me try that.

Total cost is $1,500. Desired markup is 40% on cost. So, total markup is 0.4 * 1500 = 600.

But the floor goods already contribute a markup. Let's calculate that. The floor goods cost $150. So, their markup is 0.4 * 150 = 60. So, the remaining goods need to contribute 600 - 60 = 540.

The remaining goods cost $1,350. So, the markup needed is 540. So, the markup percentage is 540 / 1350 = 0.4, which is 40%. So, the answer would be 40%, which is option I.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again.

If the markup is 40% of the total cost, then the total markup is 600. The floor goods contribute 60, so remaining must contribute 540.

Remaining goods cost $1,350. So, 540 markup on 1350 cost is 540 / 1350 = 0.4 → 40%. So, the answer is 40%, option I.

Hmm, but earlier I thought the markup was on the selling price, but the question says "desired 40% markup on the total purchase"—so that's on the total purchase, which is the cost. So, I think that approach is correct.

Alternatively, let me consider the problem statement again: The owner is to maintain the desired 40% markup on the total purchase. So, that's on the total cost, not the selling price. So, the total markup is 40% of the total cost.

So, let me recalculate:

Total cost: $1,500.

Desired markup: 0.4 * 1500 = 600. So, total selling price after markup would be 1500 + 600 = 2100.

But he has already sold the floor goods at $250. So, the remaining goods need to total 2100 - 250 = 1850 in selling price.

The remaining goods cost $1,350. So, their selling price must be 1850.

So, the total markup on the remaining is 1850 - 1350 = 500.

So, the markup percentage on the remaining is (500 / 1350) * 100 = 37.037...%, which is about 37.04%, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the markup. Let me consider that the markup is 40% on the cost. So, the selling price would be 140% of the cost.

So, for the floor goods, cost is $150, so selling price is 150 * 1.4 = 210. But the floor goods are sold for $250, which is more than 210, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the markup is 40% on the cost. So, the selling price is cost * 1.4.

But in that case, the floor goods would be sold for 150 * 1.4 = 210, not 250. So, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the markup is 40% on the cost. So, the selling price is cost * (1 + 0.4) = 1.4 * cost.

So, for the floor goods: cost $150 → selling price 150 * 1.4 = 210. So, he actually sold them for $250, which is more than 210. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the problem.

The problem says: the owner is to maintain the desired 40% markup on the total purchase. So, perhaps the markup is 40% of the total cost. So, the total markup is 40% of 1500, which is 600.

He has already sold the floor goods at $250, which is more than the cost of $150. So, the markup on the floor goods is 40% of 150, which is 60. So, the total markup needed is 600, so the remaining goods need to have a markup of 540.

The remaining goods cost $1,350. So, 540 markup is 540 / 1350 = 0.4 → 40%. So, the markup on the remaining would be 40%, which is option I.

So, the correct answer would be I: 40%.
</think>

To determine the markup percentage needed on the remaining purchases to maintain a 40% markup on the total purchase, we proceed as follows:

1. **Total Purchase Cost**: $1,500  
2. **Floor Goods Cost**: $150 (calculated as 60% of the $250 selling price)  
3. **Remaining Purchases Cost**: $1,500 - $150 = $1,350  
4. **Desired Total Markup**: 40% of total purchase cost = 0.4 * $1,500 = $600  
5. **Markup from Floor Goods**: 40% of $150 = $60  
6. **Markup Needed from Remaining Purchases**: $600 - $60 = $540  
7. **Markup Percentage for Remaining Purchases**: ($540 / $1,350) * 100 = 40%  

Thus, the markup percentage needed on the remaining purchases is **40%**.
