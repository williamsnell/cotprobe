Okay, so I have this question about the temperature of the universe and what that implies about the distance of galaxies. Hmm, I remember that the universe's temperature has changed over time, right? And the microwave background is the radiation left over from the Big Bang. 

Wait, the question says the temperature is about 3 K now, but 12 K back then. Oh, right! The temperature was higher back then. I think it's related to the expansion of the universe. Like, the universe expands, so the wavelengths of light (or the photons) stretch out. When the universe was younger, the photons were in a higher energy state, meaning the universe was cooler.

I recall the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature scales as 1 over the scale factor. The scale factor, a, represents how much the universe has expanded. So the temperature T is proportional to 1/a. So when a was smaller (the universe was younger), T was higher.

So now, the current temperature, T_now, is 3 K. At the time when it was 12 K, the scale factor a was smaller. Because T ∝ 1/a, so when T was 12, T was 4 times higher than now (since 12/3 =4), so 1/a was 4. That means a was 1/4 of the current scale factor. Oh, wait, because a goes from 1 to something smaller.

Ah, right, so a is the ratio of the current size to the size then. So if a was 1/4 today, that would mean that the universe was a quarter its size when it was hotter. Since the universe is expanding, if it's smaller, the objects are further apart.

Wait, no. Wait, when a was smaller (like a=1/4 now), that means the universe was smaller. So the objects we see now are more distant because they were farther apart when the universe was smaller. Or, from another perspective, if the universe was smaller, the same physical distance represents a larger actual distance. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think differently. The universe's expansion is such that the scale factor a increases with time. When a was 1/4, the universe was a quarter its current size. So the same physical distance now would have been 1/4th the size, implying that the universe was smaller. So objects are further away because they were then at a smaller scale.

Wait, let me think about the relation between the scale factor and the current distance. The distance to an object today is proportional to a today over a in the past. Because a is the scale factor, which is the ratio of the current size to the past size. So if a was 1/4 today, that means that the past size was 4 times smaller. So an object that's 4 times further away in the past would now be closer. Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, maybe when a was 1/4, the universe was smaller, so the same object would be 1/4th as far away. But wait, no, because the scale factor relates to the expansion. Let me think of it this way: if the universe was smaller at a=1/4, then when we observe the same object, it's as if we're looking at it from a smaller scale. So the actual physical distance is larger.

Wait, perhaps an example would help. Suppose a is 1 now. The universe is 10 billion light-years in diameter. If a was 1/2, the universe would be 5 billion light-years in diameter. So now, when the universe was smaller, it was half the size. So the same object that was 10 billion light-years away today would have been 5 billion light-years away when the universe was half the size. So the same object would appear further away now, but since the universe is smaller, the actual distance between objects is larger.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. 

The temperature T is inversely proportional to the scale factor a. So T_proportional to 1/a. So when the temperature was 12 K, which is 4 times the current temperature, a was 1/4. So a was smaller. So when the universe was a quarter its current size, the expansion was slower.

Now, the key thing is that the distance between objects today is proportional to the current scale factor. So if the universe was a quarter its current size, then a is 1/4 now. So the physical distance to the object would be 1/4 the current size. Wait, no, because the scale factor a is inversely related to the size. So if a is smaller, the physical distance is smaller.

Wait, maybe another way. Let's say that at a certain time, the scale factor was 1/4 of its current value. So the universe was 1/4 as big. So the same galaxy that is currently 10 billion light-years away would have been 2.5 billion light-years away when the universe was smaller. So the actual distance between galaxies today is four times as far apart as they were at that time.

Wait, but that's about the physical distance between objects. So in the question, the options are about the distance of galaxies. So if the universe was 1/4 its current size, then the galaxies are 4 times further apart today than they were then.

So looking at the options, option H says: four times as distant as they are today.

Wait, no, wait, the question is asking, when the temperature was 12 K, what was the distance of the galaxies compared to today. So when the universe was smaller, the galaxies were further apart. So today, they're four times as far apart as they are today. So the answer should be H: four times as distant as they are today.

Wait, but wait, the options are about what the distance was then, not today. So the options are for when the universe was 12 K. So the question is: when the temperature was 12 K (which was a quarter the current scale factor), what was the distance of galaxies compared to today.

So when a was 1/4, the actual distance between galaxies would have been 1/4 of what it is now. Because the universe was smaller, so the same galaxies were closer. So the galaxies are four times as far apart as they are today. Wait, no. Because when a was 1/4, the universe was smaller. So galaxies in the same physical location today were 1/4 as far apart in the past. So the distance today is 4 times what it was when a was 1/4.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm mixing the concepts. Let's think again. The universe's expansion can be thought of as scaling. If the universe is smaller now, then in the past, the same physical distance would have been a larger actual distance. For example, today, the universe is 100 Mpc in diameter. When it was a quarter its size, it was 25 Mpc. So the same galaxy that is 100 Mpc away now was 25 Mpc away then. So the distance today is four times greater than it was then. So when the universe was 12 K, the galaxies were one-quarter as distant as now.

So the question is, when the universe was 12 K, the galaxies were one-quarter as distant as they are today. So the answer is option C: one-quarter as distant as they are today.

Wait, but some sources say that the CMB temperature scales with 1/(a) where a is the scale factor. So when a was 1/2, the temperature was twice. Wait, wait, no: If a is the scale factor, then T ∝ 1/a. So when a is 1/4, T is 4 times higher. So when the temperature was 12 K (which is 4 times 3K), the scale factor was 1/4. So the universe was 1/4 as big, so the galaxies were 1/4 the current distance apart.

So in the options, the answer is C: one-quarter as distant as they are today.

The question involves understanding the relationship between the temperature of the universe's microwave background and the distance of galaxies at different times. The temperature of the universe is inversely proportional to the scale factor \( a \), meaning \( T \propto 1/a \). When the temperature was 12 K, it was 4 times higher than the current temperature of 3 K, so the scale factor \( a \) at that time was \( 1/4 \). 

Since \( a \) represents the ratio of the current size to the past size, \( a = 1/4 \) implies that the universe was 1/4 its current size. Consequently, the physical distance between galaxies was also 1/4 of what it is today. This means that when the universe was 12 K, the galaxies were one-quarter as distant as they are today.

Analyzing the options:
- **A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J**: These options describe various relationships between distances, but none correctly capture the relationship between the temperature and distance.
- **C**: Correct, as the galaxies were one-quarter as distant as they are today.

Thus, the correct answer is:
