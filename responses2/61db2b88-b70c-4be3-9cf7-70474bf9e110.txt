Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an electron moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says the speed is 1/137th the speed of light. Oh right, I remember that the speed of light is about 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So 1/137th of that would be the speed. Let me calculate that.

Speed v = (1/137) * c
c is 3e8 m/s, so v = (3e8)/137 ≈ 2.19e6 m/s. Wait, or is that 2.19e6 meters per second? Yeah, that seems right because 3e8 divided by 137 is approximately 2.19e6.

De Broglie wavelength formula is λ = h/(mv), right? Where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and v is the velocity.

I think Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The mass of an electron is a key value. Let me recall, the electron mass is approximately 9.11 x 10^-31 kg.

So plugging in the numbers: λ = 6.626e-34 / (9.11e-31 * 2.19e6).

Wait, let me compute the denominator first. Multiply 9.11e-31 by 2.19e6.

9.11e-31 * 2.19e6 = (9.11 * 2.19) * 1e(-31 +6) ) = (19.98) * 1e-25 ≈ 2.0e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, 9.11 * 2.19 is about 19.98, which is roughly 20. So denominator is 1.998e-25 kg·m/s. Let me get the exact value: 9.11 * 2.19... Let me calculate that more accurately. 

9.11 * 2 is 18.22, 9.11 * 0.19 is about 1.7309. So total is about 19.9509. So 19.9509e-25, or 1.995e-24 kg·m/s? Wait, 19.95e-25 is 1.995e-24. Oh wait, 19.95e-25 is 1.995e-24.

So λ = 6.626e-34 / 1.995e-24.

Dividing 6.626e-34 by 1.995e-24. Let me think, 6.626 / 1.995 is about 3.32, and the exponents: e-34 / e-24 is e-10.

So λ ≈ 3.32e-10 meters.

Wait, 3.32e-10 meters is nanometers. Because 1e-9 is a nanometer. So 3.32e-10 is 0.332 nanometers.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 6.626e-34 divided by 2.0e-24 is (approx) 3.313e-10 meters. Which is 0.3313 nanometers. That's approximately 0.331 nm.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.332 nm. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation. Let me recheck the denominator calculation.

m*v = 9.11e-31 kg * 2.19e6 m/s.

Multiply 9.11e-31 by 2.19e6. So 9.11 * 2.19 is about 19.95, and the exponents: 1e-31 * 1e6 = 1e-25. So 19.95e-25 kg·m/s. Which is approximately 2.0e-24 kg·m/s. So denominator is 2.0e-24 kg·m/s.

Planck's constant is 6.626e-34 J·s. So 6.626e-34 / 2.0e-24 = (6.626/2.0) * 1e-10. 6.626/2 is about 3.313, so 3.313e-10 m. Which is 0.3313 nm.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.332 nm. So the correct answer is option J.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron moving at 1/137th the speed of light, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}
\]

where:
- \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)),
- \( m \) is the mass of the electron (\( 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the electron.

The speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), so the velocity \( v \) is:

\[
v = \frac{c}{137} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{137} \approx 2.19 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Next, calculate the momentum \( mv \):

\[
mv = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \times 2.19 \times 10^6 \approx 2.0 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Now, substitute into the de Broglie formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2.0 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 3.313 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}.
\]

This is equivalent to:

\[
\lambda \approx 0.3313 \, \text{nm}.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **0.332 nm**, which corresponds to option J.
