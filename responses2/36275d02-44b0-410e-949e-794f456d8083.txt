Okay, so I've got this accounting question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question says that Large City hasn't modified their approach for accounting roads. At the start of the current year, they spent $8,000,000 on new roads. These roads have a 20-year useful life. The question is asking what amount they should report as an expense in the statement of activities for the current year.

Hmm, I remember there are a few key accounting concepts here. The statement of activities usually relates to cash flows, not the financial statements' income statement. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the statement of activities is part of the cash flow statement, right? But the question is about the expenses. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The statement of activities typically reports cash inflows and outflows from operating activities. So the amount spent on the roads would be part of the operating activities, but since it's about the expense, that's when it's expensed.

Wait, but under the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are recognized when they are incurred, not when paid. So if the city spent $8 million now, that's an expense, right? But in the statement of cash flows, the amount would be the same, because in cash terms, they spent the money now. Unless there's a difference in timing.

Wait, the question is about the amount reported as an expense in the statement of activities. So the statement of activities probably refers to the cash basis or the accrual basis? Wait no, the statement of activities usually refers to cash flows, regardless of the basis. So the expense would be the amount spent, which is $8,000,000. Because when they spend the money, that's the expense on the income statement. But wait, in the statement of cash flows, the cash outflow for the roads would be $8,000,000. But the question asks about the expense.

Wait, but the question says "report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year." So the statement of activities is about the cash flows from operating activities. So the expense would be the amount they spent, $8 million, because that's the cost of goods sold or something like that. Unless they're using the modified approach, but the question says they don't. Oh wait, the question says "modified approach not used." Does that affect how they report the expense? I don't think so. The accounting method (modified approach vs. straight-line) affects the depreciation or the cost of the asset, not the expense itself. So regardless of the method, the expense is $8 million.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "what amount should Large City report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities..." The statement of activities is about cash flows, so the expense would be $8 million. Because the $8 million is the actual outlay for the roads, which is an expense.

So looking at the options, option B is $8,000,000.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes companies have multiple methods. Like, for example, if they used a modified approach, maybe the cost of goods sold is adjusted. But the question says they didn't use the modified approach, so that doesn't change the fact that the expense is $8 million. Because the modified approach would affect how the cost is recorded (like in modified cost of goods sold), but the actual expense is based on the cash paid.

So no, the expense is $8 million, which is option B.

The question asks for the amount Large City should report as an expense related to the new roads in the statement of activities for the current year. The statement of activities typically reports cash flows from operating activities. The city spent $8,000,000 on new roads, which is an expense. Since the question focuses on the expense reported, regardless of the method (modified or straight-line), the amount remains $8,000,000.

Answer: B
