Question:

Which of the following is a true statement about hypothesis testing?

Options:

A: Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.
B: The power of a test concerns its ability to reject a null hypothesis.
C: The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.
D: If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 10% level, there is a 10% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.
E: If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 5% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 10% level.
F: If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 99% chance of not rejecting the null hypothesis.
G: The power of a test concerns its ability to detect a null hypothesis.
H: If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level.
I: If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about hypothesis testing. I need to figure out which statements are true. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question asks which statements are correct about hypothesis testing. The options are from A to I, each making a specific claim.

Starting with option A: Whether to use a one- or two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered. Hmm, wait. I remember that the choice between one-sided and two-sided tests is usually made before data collection because it affects the critical region. So if you decide before, you don't have to wait for data. So A might be false.

Option B: The power of a test concerns its ability to reject a null hypothesis. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null when it's false. So I think B is correct. Because the power is about rejecting the null when it's false, not just the ability to reject it in general.

Option C: The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. Wait, power is about the alternative hypothesis's ability to be detected, yes. Because it's about the probability of rejecting the null when the alternative is true. So C is correct.

Option D: If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 10% level, there is a 10% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. I don't think this is correct. The significance level (alpha) is the probability of rejecting H0 when it's true, not the chance of rejecting it when it's false. So D is wrong.

Option E: If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 5% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 10% level. Wait, no. Because a lower significance level (5%) might lead to a smaller critical region, so rejecting at 5% doesn't necessarily mean you'll reject at 10%. It depends on the p-value. So E is false.

Option F: If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 99% chance of not rejecting the null hypothesis. Wait, no. The significance level is 1%, so there's a 1% chance of rejecting H0 when it's true. The probability of not rejecting when H0 is true is 99%, which is the Type II error probability (beta). So F is incorrect because it's talking about the probability of not rejecting, which is about Type II error, not the significance level.

Option G: The power of a test concerns its ability to detect a null hypothesis. Wait, power is about detecting the alternative, not the null. Because the null is what we're testing against. So G is incorrect.

Option H: If there is sufficient evidence to reject a null hypothesis at the 10% level, then there is sufficient evidence to reject it at the 5% level. Again, no. Because a lower alpha (5%) test is more strict. Rejecting at 10% doesn't guarantee rejecting at 5%. So H is wrong.

Option I: If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. Yes, that's correct because the significance level is 1%. So I is true.

Wait, let me recap:

Which options are correct?

B, C, and I are correct? Hmm, let's check again.

Option B: Correct because power is the ability to reject the null when it's false.

Option C: Correct because power is about detecting the alternative.

Option I: Correct because alpha (significance level) is the probability of rejecting H0 when it's true.

So the correct statements are B, C, I.
</think>

The correct statements about hypothesis testing are:

B: The power of a test concerns its ability to reject a null hypothesis.

C: The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.

I: If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.

ANSWER: B, C, I
