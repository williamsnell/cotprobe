Question:

The appraised values of houses in a city have a mean of $125,000 with a standard deviation of $23,000. Because of a new teachers' contract, the school district needs an extra 10% in funds compared to the previous year. To raise this additional money, the city instructs the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000. What will be the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city?

Options:

A: $29,000
B: $26,000
C: $25,300
D: $24,500
E: $28,000
F: $27,500
G: $32,500
H: $23,000
I: $31,000
J: $30,300

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here. Let me read it through carefully.

The question is about the appraised values of houses in a city. The mean is $125,000 and the standard deviation is $23,000. Because of a new teachers' contract, the school district needs an extra 10% in funds. The city tells them to raise all appraised house values by $5,000. The question is asking what the new standard deviation will be.

Hmm, I remember that standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers are. It's calculated from the mean. Now, the problem involves adding a constant to all the values. So, let's think about what happens to the mean and standard deviation when you add a constant to each data point.

Wait, when you add a constant to each value, the mean increases by that constant. So, the original mean is $125,000, so the new mean after adding $5,000 would be $125,000 + $5,000 = $130,000. But what about standard deviation?

I remember that adding a constant to each data point doesn't change the spread. Because standard deviation is a measure of dispersion, not location. So, adding a constant shifts all the values up by that amount but doesn't make any of them more spread out. So, the standard deviation remains the same.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Suppose all the values were increased by, say, $5,000. Each value is now $5,000 higher. But their differences from each other remain the same. So, the difference between each value and the mean is the same. That means the variance (and thus the standard deviation) doesn't change.

So, the original standard deviation was $23,000. After adding $5,000 to each value, the standard deviation stays the same, $23,000.

Looking at the options, option H is $23,000. So, that should be the answer.

Wait, but I want to be absolutely sure. Let me think again. Suppose we have a dataset where each value is increased by $5,000. Let's say the original standard deviation is σ. The variance is σ². When you add a constant c to each value, the new values become x + c, where x is the original. The mean becomes μ + c. The variance is the average of (x + c - (μ + c))², which simplifies to (x - μ)². So, the variance doesn't change. Therefore, the standard deviation, which is the square root of variance, remains the same.

Yes, that's correct. Adding a constant doesn't affect standard deviation. So the standard deviation remains $23,000.
</think>

The standard deviation is unaffected by adding a constant to all values. Since the appraised values are increased by $5,000, the standard deviation remains the same as the original value, $23,000. 

Answer: H
