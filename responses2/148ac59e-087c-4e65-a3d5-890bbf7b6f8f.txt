Okay, so I've got this Jaina group question to answer. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking which Jaina group only allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation. The options are A to J, each a different Jaina group.

First, I remember that Jainism has various groups, each with different practices. The key here is to figure out which group restricts men to renounce their vows but allows women to keep their vows.

I know that there are several main Jainic groups. Let me list them out and think about their characteristics.

Option A: Murtipujaka. I think Murtipujaka is one of the main groups. I recall that in Murtipujaka, men are required to renounce their vows, but women can continue to do so. So Murtipujaka allows women semi-renounce, but not full renunciation. That fits the question.

Option B: Digambara. Wait, I'm not sure. I think Digambara is another group where women have certain vows. But I don't remember if it allows women to semi-renounce. Maybe it's the other way around, or perhaps it's different.

Option C: Agama. That's the Brahmin or Brahmin-like group. I'm pretty sure in Agama, women are required to renounce their vows. So this group doesn't allow semi-renunciation; they have to fully renounce.

Option D: Yapaniya. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Yapaniya is a group that includes women who have certain vows. I think women in Yapaniya have to renounce their vows, so they can't lead as semi-roæ±‰ as some others.

Option E: Jain Yoga. That's more about the practices of the Jains, like meditation and the Kama-Samhita. Doesn't directly relate to vows or renunciation.

Option F: Terapanthi. I'm not sure about this one. I think Terapanthi is a group that has various vows, but I'm not certain if it allows women to semi-renounce.

Option G: Jina. Jina is another group where women are required to renounce their vows. So this doesn't fit.

Option H: Shramana. Shramana is the lowest Jaina group, women must renounce. So no.

Option I: Svetambara. I'm not familiar with this one. It might be a lesser-known group where women have different vows.

Option J: Tirthankara. That's the Upanishads group, which includes various Jains. Not relevant here.

Putting it all together. Murtipujaka (A) is the group where women can have a semi-renunciation. Others either require full renunciation or don't allow semi-renunciation. So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A: Murtipujaka. In Murtipujaka, women are allowed to lead a life of semi-renunciation while men are required to renounce their vows.

Answer: A
