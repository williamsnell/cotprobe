Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it again.

The question is about a bank robbery where a person is wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Three weeks after the robbery, a defendant is arrested and charged with the crime. At trial, the prosecution wants to introduce evidence showing that the defendant had previously committed the same crime with those specific items. The defendant objects and the question is whether this evidence should be admitted.

Hmm, I remember that in evidence law, hearsay is a type of evidence that is un证证证据. So, the defendant can't simply prove they committed the crime because it's hearsay. But there are some exceptions.

Wait, what are the exceptions for hearsay? There's the statement by a witness, the statement of the opposing party, and maybe the defense's own statement. But I think the defense's statement is an exception only if it's made without any knowledge of the truth, which I don't think applies here. Also, the defendant's own statement can't be used to prove guilt because it's hearsay.

So, the defendant is claiming to have committed the crime, which is hearsay. But can the defendant's own statement be used to prove guilt? I don't think so. So, the prosecution can't just bring that evidence because it's hearsay and doesn't meet the required exception.

Wait, but sometimes, the defendant's own account is used to establish guilt. Like, in some cases, the defendant's former statement might be used. But I think that's when the statement is not hearsay or meets an exception. If the defendant has a prior incriminating statement, maybe they can use it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the prior statements are admissible as circumstantial evidence. Wait, but admissibility of circumstantial evidence is another topic. Circumstantial evidence supports the truth of a fact but isn't itself evidence of guilt. So, the defendant's prior statement is an exception to the requirement of probative value in favor of guilt, but it's not itself evidence of guilt. 

So, if the prosecution wants to say that the defendant must have committed the crime before, that's hearsay. But can the defendant's statement be used to show guilt? I think the correct approach is that the defendant can't prove guilt by their own statement. But maybe the charging authority can use it as circumstantial evidence. But no, circumstantial evidence isn't evidence of guilt; it's just to show the truth of the matter. So, that wouldn't help the prosecution.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant has a prior incriminating statement. So, perhaps the prosecution can use that statement as evidence of guilt. But no, because it's hearsay. Unless it's a statement made by the defendant to themselves, which might be allowed as a defense, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the hearsay exceptions again. The statement by a witness (A) is an exception if it's made without the defendant's knowledge and with a purpose to introduce the statement. But that's if the statement is a hearsay issue.

Alternatively, the statement against the defense (B) is an exception if it's presented to show the opposing party's innocence. But that might not be the case here.

So, the defendant's own statement is hearsay and cannot be used to prove guilt. The prosecution can't introduce it without violating the hearsay rule unless it's an exception. But if the defendant is using their own statement, then they could argue that the prosecution is using it to show guilt, but that would be against the rules because it's hearsay.

Wait, but the question is whether the evidence should be introduced. The prosecution seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had prior incriminating statements. The defendant objects, thinking it's hearsay and thus inadmissible.

So, what's the allowable way to introduce that evidence? The correct answer is that it's admissible as a statement against the witness, but that's a different topic. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible because it's the defendant's own statement, which can be used to establish guilt, but that's not allowed under hearsay rules.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the correct approach. The defendant is claiming to have prior incriminating statements. The prosecution seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed the crime. The defendant objects as it's hearsay.

But the defense can argue that the statement is hearsay and thus inadmissible. The defendant can't use their own statement to prove guilt, so they can’t introduce the evidence. Alternatively, maybe the defendant's prior statements were admissible as part of the case.

Wait, the defendant could present their own statement as a defense, but that's not the issue here. The question is whether the evidence is admissible. The defendant's attorney objects. So, the defendant's attorney is saying that the evidence is inadmissible.

But the question is whether the evidence (the defendant's prior statements) should be admitted. So, the correct answer is whether it's inadmissible. Since it's hearsay and meets no exception (the statement isn't made without the defendant's knowledge, and it's presented to show guilt), it can't be admitted. Therefore, the inadmissible option is A, because it's hearsay without exception.

Wait, but another point: the defendant's prior statements can be admitted as circumstantial evidence to support guilt. But they can't introduce the evidence as evidence of guilt. So, if the charging authority wants to show that the defendant had prior incriminating statements, they can introduce the statements as evidence of guilt, but they cannot do so as hearsay.

Wait, but the question is about whether the evidence should be admitted. So, the defendant's prior statements are hearsay and inadmissible as such. So, the correct answer is A: inadmissible, because it's hearsay.

The question revolves around whether the defendant's prior incriminating statements can be admitted as evidence. These statements are hearsay, meaning they are un证证证据 and cannot be used as evidence of guilt unless supported by an exception. The defendant's attorney objects on the grounds that the evidence is inadmissible, but the prosecution seeks to introduce it as circumstantial evidence to show guilt.

The defendant's prior statements meet no exception for hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence, such as being made without the defendant's knowledge or being against the defense. Therefore, the evidence cannot be admitted as it is hearsay. Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
