Okay, so I've got this question about blackbody radiation and the maximum wavelength it reaches. Hmm, I think I remember something about Wien's Law from my physics class. Let me think. Wien's Law relates the temperature of a blackbody to the wavelength at which its emission peaks. The formula I remember is λ_max * T = constant. Oh right, it's approximately 2.9 × 10^-3 meters·kelvin. 

The question says the Sun's surface is about 6000 K and emits a blackbody spectrum with a maximum around 500 nm. So, for a body at 300 K, I need to find the maximum wavelength. 

Wait, Wien's Law is λ_max = (constant) / T. Right. So plugging in the numbers. The constant is about 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K. The temperature here is 300 K. So λ_max = 2.898e-3 / 300.

Let me calculate that. 2.898e-3 divided by 300. Let's see, 2.898e-3 is 0.002898. Divided by 300 is 0.002898 / 300 ≈ 9.66e-6 meters. Wait, that's 9.66 micrometers, which is 9660 nm. Wait, that can't be right because 9660 nm is 9.66 mm. Wait, but the options don't have that. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, wait. Wait, 2.898e-3 divided by 300. Let me compute it numerically. 2.898e-3 is 0.002898. 0.002898 divided by 300 is 0.00000966. Oh wait, no, 0.002898 / 300 is 0.00000966 meters? Wait, no, that's 9.66e-6 meters, which is 0.00966 micrometers, or 0.00966 mm, which is 9.66 micrometers. Wait, that's 9660 nm. Because 1 micrometer is 1e6 nm. So 0.00966 micrometers is 9660 nm. So that's 9.66 micrometers or 9660 nm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in meters, millimeters, centimeters, etc. Let me see the options again. The options are A:10 mm, B:1000 nm, C:10,000 nm, D:1 m, E:1 cm, F:10 cm, G:10:00 PM, H:100 Pm, I:100 mm, J:500 nm.

Wait, the options for the wavelength are given as, for example, 10 mm (which is 10,000 nm), 1000 nm, 10,000 nm, etc. So our calculated value is 9660 nm, which is close to 10,000 nm. So the closest option would be option C, which is 10,000 nm. 

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check. Let me think about the Wien's Law again. Another way to remember is the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. So as temperature decreases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths.

Sun's surface is 6000 K, peak at 500 nm. So for 300 K, it's 300 times cooler. So the peak wavelength should be longer by a factor of 300. Because T2 = T1 * (λ1 / λ2). So λ2 = λ1 * (T1 / T2). T1 is 6000, T2 300. So λ2 = 500 nm * (6000 / 300) = 500 * 20 = 10,000 nm. 

So 10,000 nm is option C. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the wavelength at which a blackbody spectrum reaches a maximum for a body with a surface temperature of 300 K, we use Wien's Law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \cdot T = \text{constant}
\]

Here, the constant is approximately \( 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K} \), and the temperature \( T \) is 300 K. Rearranging the formula gives:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{\text{constant}}{T}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{300} = 9.66 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 9660 \, \text{nm}
\]

This corresponds to approximately 10,000 nm. To confirm, we can use Wien's Law in terms of the Sun's spectrum, where the Sun's surface temperature is 6000 K and the peak wavelength is 500 nm. Since the Sun is much hotter, the peak wavelength for a 300 K body is longer than that of the Sun. Specifically, the peak wavelength scales inversely with temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
\]

Thus, the peak wavelength for a 300 K body is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = 500 \, \text{nm} \cdot \frac{6000}{300} = 10,000 \, \text{nm}
\]

Among the given options, the closest match is 10,000 nm, which corresponds to option C.
