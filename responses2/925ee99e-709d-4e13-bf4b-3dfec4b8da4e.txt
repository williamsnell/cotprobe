Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about my aunt running a pie shop. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question is asking which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. Her main job is making apple pies, so labor would involve the people helping her, like the friends she hires.

Option A: Tax on apple pie sales. If the tax increases, maybe she'd have less money to spend on pies. But would that affect her labor? If her income decreases, maybe she'd need fewer employees, so her demand for labor would decrease. So A might not be the right choice.

Option B: Apple peelers/corers rise in price. Wait, if the cost of these tools goes up, the cost of making pies might increase. But does that affect the number of people she hires? If she can't make pies as efficiently, maybe she would need fewer employees. So B would likely decrease demand for labor, not increase. So B isn't the answer.

Option C: Apples fall in price. If apples are cheaper, the cost of making pies would go down. More people can be employed without increasing costs, so her demand for labor would increase. That makes sense. So C is a possibility.

Option D: Sale on ovens. More oven capacity might make pies more efficient, but does that affect the number of people she needs? If she can make more pies with the same number of workers, but the price per pie increases, maybe she'd need more people to keep up. Wait, but the question is about increasing demand for labor, meaning more people she needs. If the oven is better, maybe more pies can be made with fewer workers. So the same number of workers could produce the same number of pies, so maybe demand for labor doesn't change. But if the price per pie increases, but the oven is better, maybe she can make more pies with the same number of workers, leading to more customers. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, if she can make more pies with the same labor, maybe the same number of workers can produce more pies, which might mean she doesn't need more people, so the demand for labor would stay the same or decrease. So D might not be the answer.

Option E: New study says apples increase cancer risk. Wait, that's a medical issue. It might affect her health, making her less willing to eat apples, which would reduce sales. If she can't sell as much, maybe she needs fewer workers, so demand for labor would decrease. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F: Aunt's friends start their own apple pie businesses. That would increase the demand for her pies because her friends are doing their own work. So the demand for her pies would go up, which could mean she needs more help. So her demand for labor would increase. So F is a possible candidate.

Option G: Popular celebrity endorses a different brand. That might make her pies more appealing, increasing demand. So F (friends' businesses) would increase demand, leading to more labor needed. So F is a good candidate.

Option H: Popular TV show features how to make pies at home. Maybe it makes pies more attractive, increasing demand. So H would increase demand, F or H would both be good options.

Option I: Aunt switches to pumpkins. That would affect her product line. Maybe her apple pie demand decreases, leading to fewer workers. So I would decrease demand for labor. So I is probably not the right choice.

Option J: Friends gossip all day, slowing dough-making. That would reduce the quality of pies or the time to make them. So her output might go down. If she can't make as many, she might need fewer workers. So J would decrease demand for labor. So J is not the answer.

So the options that affect her demand for labor are C (apples fall) and F (friends start their own businesses). Which one is more likely to increase demand for labor.

Wait, let's think again. If the friends start a business, their own pies are being produced, so her demand for her own pies increases. That would increase her need for help, leading to higher demand for her labor. So F is a likely answer.

If apples fall, her production cost goes down, which might allow her to produce more pies with the same number of workers, so she may not need as many people, but if the price per pie increases, maybe she can't make as many pies. Wait, no, wait. If the apples are cheaper, the cost per pie goes down. So if she can make more pies with the same number of workers, then she can sell more, which would require more workers. So if the apples fall, her ability to make more pies increases. But wait, the question is about her demand for labor. So if her sales go up because the apples are cheaper, she can produce more pies, which increases the number of customers. So she might need more help, so demand for labor would increase.

Wait, the initial situation: she is running her business. If the price of apples falls, her costs go down. So she can make more pies. So she's producing more, which increases her demand for labor. So both C and F would lead to higher demand for her labor.

But the question says which would most likely increase her demand for labor. So which of these is more likely?

Wait, the question is which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. So which one is more directly causing an increase in the number of people she needs to employ.

If the friends start their own businesses, her own pie demand increases, so she would need more help, so F is a likely candidate.

If apples fall, her costs go down, so she can make more pies, which increases demand, so C is also a candidate.

So both C and F are correct. But looking back at the options, the question is which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. So both options C and F would lead to higher demand.

Wait, but the question is about which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. So let's see the options.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question is asking which one would most likely increase her demand for labor.

So let's evaluate each choice.

Another angle: suppose the friends start their own businesses. That would increase the demand for her own pies, so she needs more help (more demand for labor). So F would increase the demand.

If apples fall, her costs go down, so she can make more pies, so she needs more help, so C would increase the demand.

Now, which of these is more likely to increase her demand? Both.

But perhaps the question is about the direct effect on her own business. So if her friends start a business, her own pie demand increases, which would directly increase her need for labor. So F is a correct answer.

But what about the options? The question is asking which would most likely increase her demand for labor. So the correct options are C and F.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, and the answer has to be one letter.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is F or C.

Wait, let me re-read the options.

Option C: Price of apples falls.

If apples are cheaper, the cost of making pies would drop. So her cost per pie decreases, making her more profitable. So she can make more pies, which would increase her demand for labor. So yes, C would cause more demand.

Option F: Aunt's friends start their own apple pie businesses. So their own pies are being made, which increases the demand for her pies. So her own demand for labor increases because she needs more help to make more pies. So F is correct.

Now, the question is to choose between C and F.

Wait, but the question is about which would most likely increase her demand for labor. Since both would do that, but the options are A to J, and the answer is one letter.

Wait, the question is: Which of the following situations would most likely increase her demand for labor?

So both C and F are correct. But perhaps the question is expecting only one correct option.

Wait, let's think again.

Wait, the initial scenario is that she has her own business. So if her friends start a business, her own pie demand increases, which would increase her demand for labor. So F is correct.

If apples fall, her production cost goes down, making her more efficient. So she can produce more pies, so more demand for her labor. So C is correct.

Now, the question is to choose between C and F.

Wait, but the question is about which would increase her demand for labor. Both do.

But the options are single choices. So which is the better option.

Wait, the question is about her demand for labor. So if the friends start a business, their own pies increase, so her own demand increases. So F is correct.

If the apples fall, her cost goes down, which can allow her to make more pies, so demand increases. So C is correct.

So both F and C would increase her demand for labor.

Wait, looking at the options, the question is which of the following would most likely increase her demand for labor. So both C and F are correct.

But wait, the question only allows one letter as the answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor.

Option F: friends start their own pie businesses. So this would increase the demand for her pies, hence she would need more help, so her demand for labor increases. So F is correct.

Option C: if apples fall, her cost goes down. This makes her more efficient, allowing her to produce more pies. So her demand for labor would increase. So C is correct.

So perhaps both are correct, but the question is expecting one answer. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question is which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor.

I think both C and F are correct. But looking back at the options, perhaps F and C are both correct, but the question is presented as a single-answer multiple-choice.

Wait, perhaps in the options, both would be correct, but the only one that's correct is F. Because the friends' own business starts, their pies are a direct demand for her, so her own pie demand would increase, which leads to more labor.

Alternatively, perhaps the fall in apples (C) leads to lower cost, allowing her to produce more pies which would require more labor, so C is correct.

Wait, the question is which of the following would most likely increase her demand for labor. So both C and F are correct.

But wait, looking at the options, let me see what the possible answers are.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question is which would most likely increase her demand. So the correct options are C and F.

But looking at the options provided, the correct ones are C and F.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question is which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor.

Wait, but the question is which of the following (A-F) would most likely increase her demand.

So the correct options are C and F.

But I need to look at the options in the question.

Wait, the options are:

C: Price of apples falls.

F: Aunt's friends start their own apple pie businesses.

So both C and F are correct.

But the question is multiple-choice, with only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

If the friends start their own pie businesses, their own pies would be a part of her demand, so her own pie demand increases, which would require more help. So F is correct.

If the apples fall, her cost per pie decreases, allowing her to produce more pies, which would require more help, so C is correct.

So both C and F would increase her demand for labor.

But perhaps the question is asking which situation is more directly favorable for her. Let me think about the options.

Wait, the question is about the 'last character' of the answer. So after thinking, I should pick the correct letter.

Wait, the options are multiple-choice with letters A-J, each being a possible correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that both C and F are correct, but the options are presented as single options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because her friends' pie businesses directly increase her own pie demand, requiring more help.

Alternatively, perhaps C is also correct.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is F because the friends' own pie businesses would require more pies than her own, so more help is needed.

In that case, both C and F would be correct, but the options are single letters. Maybe the correct answer is F because her friends' pie business is a direct demand for her pie.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option C: Price of apples falls. So her cost per pie goes down. That makes her more efficient, so she can produce more pies with the same number of workers. So her demand for labor would increase. So C is correct.

Option F: Friends' own pie businesses. Her own pie demand increases, so she needs more help. So F is correct.

So both C and F would increase her demand for labor, making them both correct options.

But the problem is that the question allows only one correct answer, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is about which of the following would most likely increase her demand for labor.

Wait, perhaps C is the correct answer because it's a direct effect on production costs. If the apples fall, her cost goes down, which could allow her to produce more pies, so her demand for labor increases.

But if her friends start a business, their own pies increase demand, so that also increases her own demand for labor.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is both C and F, but the options are single letters. Wait, no, the options are presented as single letters, so perhaps the correct answer is F because her friends' pie business directly affects her own business, so her demand increases.

Wait, but I think I need to pick the answer which is correct. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because her friends' pie businesses are a direct demand for her pies. So if her friends start making pies, that increases the demand for her pies, so she needs more help. So F is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps C is correct because it directly affects her production costs, making her more efficient and thus more likely to need more help.

Wait, perhaps both are correct, but the options are presented as single letters. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

The question is about which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. So the correct options would be all that cause her demand for labor to increase.

But in the multiple-choice options, the answer is a single letter. So perhaps the correct answer is F because her friends' pie business is a direct demand for her own pies, thus increasing her own demand for labor.

Wait, but if C is correct and F is correct, but the options don't have a combined choice, perhaps the answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both C and F, but the question allows only one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, because her friends' pie business would directly affect her own pie demand, thus increasing her demand for labor.

So, in that case, the answer is F.

The question asks which situation would most likely increase the demand for labor by your aunt, who runs a pie shop. The analysis of each option is as follows:

- **Option A (Government tax on apple pies):** An increase in tax would reduce her income, potentially leading to fewer employees. This would decrease demand for labor, so **A is incorrect**.

- **Option B (Price of peelers/corers rises):** An increase in input costs would reduce profit margins, potentially leading to fewer employees. This would decrease demand for labor, so **B is incorrect**.

- **Option C (Apples fall in price):** A cheaper input (apples) reduces production costs, allowing her to produce more pies with the same number of workers. This increases demand for labor, so **C is correct**.

- **Option D (Sale on ovens):** More oven capacity could increase efficiency, but if the price per pie increases, it might not directly increase demand for labor. This would depend on the price increase, but the question focuses on cost reduction, so **D is incorrect**.

- **Option E (New study about cancer risk):** Increased health risk might affect demand for pies, but it would likely reduce demand for labor. This **E is incorrect**.

- **Option F (Friends start their own pie businesses):** This directly increases the demand for your aunt's pies, leading to an increase in her own demand for labor. **F is correct**.

- **Option G (Celebrity endorses pies):** A favorable marketing promotion could increase demand for pies, directly increasing demand for labor. **G is correct**.

- **Option H (TV show featuring home pies):** A favorable marketing promotion could increase demand for pies, directly increasing demand for labor. **H is correct**.

- **Option I (Aunt switches to pumpkins):** Switching products might reduce demand for pies, decreasing demand for labor. **I is incorrect**.

- **Option J (Friends gossip slowing dough-making):** Reduced efficiency in dough-making could lead to lower demand for pies and, consequently, lower demand for labor. **J is incorrect**.

Both **C** (apples fall) and **F** (friends start their own businesses) increase demand for labor. However, since only one answer is expected, **F** is the most direct and immediate effect, as it directly increases the demand for pies, which your aunt would need to supply.

ANSWER: F
