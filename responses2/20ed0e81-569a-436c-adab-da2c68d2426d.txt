Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

In what ways is it possible to gain a definition of terrorism?

Options:

A: A terrorist attack is that which uses the threat or use of organized violence to achieve political objectives. This may include kidnappings and organized violence for financial gain, and such attacks can be undertaken by groups or individuals.
B: Organization is essential for a successful campaign to bring about the political goals that are being sought. An act of terrorism targets an audience that extends beyond the immediate victims and is characterized as being a weapon of the weak.
C: Terrorist violence is a form of psychological warfare that generates fear in a target audience by attacking members of that group. Selected targets are chosen at random from a cross-section of groups within the state ranging from political representatives, security forces, civilians or law enforcement. Random acts of violence contribute to the sense of insecurity and societal instability.
D: Terrorism is a broad concept that is understood to denote the threat or use of organized violence for the attainment of political objectives. The definition may therefore be inclusive of governments as targets or perpetrators and cases of war (hot and cold) where terror and counter-terror measures are tactics of either side.

Okay, I need to figure out how to answer this multiple-choice question about the definition of terrorism. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is asking which option correctly describes ways to gain a definition of terrorism. The options are A, B, C, D, E (though the options only go up to J, but E isn't listed here).

I remember that terrorism, or the act of terrorism, is about organized violence aimed at achieving political objectives. It's a complex issue with various angles, so I'll need to think about each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A terrorist attack uses organized violence for political purposes, like kidnappings or financial gain. It can be done by groups or individuals. This seems to cover the main idea of organized violence as a means to achieve political goals. 

Option B: Organization is essential for a successful terrorist campaign. It targets an audience beyond victims, described as a weak weapon. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think some sources say that terrorism is a tactic used by groups, but others might argue that it's a weapon that can be used against civilians. Also, the term "targets beyond immediate victims" might not be accurate. 

Option C: It's psychological warfare, random attacks on a target audience. The targets are political representatives, security forces, civilians, or law enforcement. Random violence helps instill insecurity, causing societal instability. I'm not sure if this is the standard definition. Some people argue that terrorism is more about psychological tactics, not random violence, and that it's more about groups and threats than random acts.

Option D: It's a broad term, including governments as targets or perpetrators, and includes cases of war. The definition is inclusive. This seems to suggest that terrorism is a widespread issue with no specific target except for individuals or groups. But I've read that terrorism is often targeted at civilians and groups, not just governments. Also, including war cases might be a bit too broad, as some say terrorism is more about national security or targeting specific groups.

So, breaking down each option:

A seems to be a good start. It describes organized violence aimed at political objectives, which is a basic definition. However, it doesn't mention the possibility of targeting civilians or groups. It doesn't specify that it's organized and for political purposes, but that's the core idea.

Option C talks about psychological warfare and random acts, but I'm not sure if that's the standard definition. It might be more about group tactics and psychological tactics rather than just random violence.

Option B's description about the audience being beyond the victims and it being a weapon of the weak â€“ I'm not sure if that's accurate. Also, I've heard that terrorism is often a tactic used against specific groups, not just people.

Option D's definition is broad, but as I thought, it's more about targeted attacks and includes war cases, which might not be entirely accurate. Some sources suggest that terrorism is primarily aimed at civilians and groups, not the government.

Wait, looking again at option A: it says "the use of organized violence to achieve political objectives." That's a good summary. It doesn't mention anything about the audience or random acts, but I'm thinking that's part of the broader definition. So A covers the main idea of organized, political intent.

Option C's description is more about psychological tactics and random acts. I'm not sure if that's the primary definition. The question is about ways to gain a definition, so maybe option A is more accurate because it focuses on organized violence aimed at political purposes.

Alternatively, another way to look at it is that none of the options perfectly describe the definition, but the best fit is A. Because it defines it in terms of organized, political intent, which is a common and accurate definition.

The correct answer is A.

Option A provides a clear definition of terrorism, focusing on organized violence aimed at achieving political objectives. It captures the essence of terrorism as a tactic with political intent, which aligns well with common definitions. Other options either imply broader or less precise definitions or focus on different aspects of terrorism, such as psychological tactics or government targets, which are less comprehensive. Therefore, Option A best fits the question's criteria.

Answer: A
