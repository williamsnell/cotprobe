Question:

A writer sent a four-page synopsis of an idea for a new television series to a Hollywood producer. He sent it in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant in a phone call, and mentioned his expectation of compensation. She said, "Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work." She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?

Options:

A: The court will rule that there can be no contract as the writer didn't explicitly state his expectation for compensation for the idea itself.
B: The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.
C: The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.
D: The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.
E: The court will rule that there was a unilateral contract, with the producer obligated to pay only if he used the idea.
F: The court will rule that the writer's case is invalid as there was no written agreement.
G: The court will rule that the producer's assistant lacked the authority to form a contract, and thus, no contract exists.
H: There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.
I: The court will rule that the phone call between the writer and the producer's assistant formed a verbal contract.

Okay, so I've got this law question about contracts and whether a writer can claim a breach of contract based on a synopsis he sent to a producer. Let me try to break this down.

First, the situation: The writer sends a four-page synopsis to a Hollywood producer. He's looking for new ideas, so he's probably in a market where he's trying to find a new project. He's discussing this with the producer's assistant in a phone call and mentions his expectation of compensation. The assistant says she'll go over it with her boss. Months later, he gets a casting call, and the plot and characters are almost identical. He sued the producer for breach of contract, but the producer defending says there's no contract. The question is, what's the court's ruling?

I remember that contracts require something called mutual assent or consideration. So, for a contract to exist, the parties must have an understanding, and both need to agree to something. Let's think about the details here.

The writer sent a synopsis, which is a draft. He's using it, so it's not an original idea. The synopsis is a draft, so maybe it's not something he would have made up on his own. But does that affect the contract? I think the key factors are whether there's mutual agreement to something, and if there's consideration involved.

The synopsis was sent in response to an ad for new ideas. So, perhaps the writer's intention was to find a new project. But then, the assistant mentioned expecting compensation, and they plan to meet. So, the writer sent a draft of an idea, and the producer's assistant is going to meet with the writerâ€”maybe to discuss terms. But the writer sent a draft, not an original idea.

Wait, the writer didn't state his expectation of compensation explicitly. He just sent the synopsis and discussed with the assistant about his expectation. The assistant said she would go over it with her boss and the writer mentioned expecting compensation. So, the writer didn't say he'd pay. Did that mention of compensation count as consideration?

I think mutual agreement is key. If the writer and the producer's assistant agreed to discuss the terms, then that's mutual. But if the writer simply sent a draft without any mention of compensation, then perhaps no consideration was exchanged. Because there's no indication that one party is offering something in exchange for something else. The writer didn't offer anything; he just sent a draft, and the producer's assistant is agreeing to discuss terms.

So, mutual agreement is needed for a contract. If the writer and assistant only met to discuss compensation, but didn't explicitly agree on what to discuss, then maybe there's no mutual agreement. So, no contract.

Wait, but the assistant said she would go over it with her boss. So, maybe there was a meeting where the assistant agreed to meet the writer, and perhaps the writer agreed to discuss compensation. But the writer didn't explicitly state his expectation. 

Alternatively, maybe the wire transfer of the synopsis is considered a gift. Because sometimes when you send a draft without original content, especially in a professional setting, it's not considered a contract. The writer might have sent an idea, but if it's a draft, maybe the contract is a gift.

Another angle: The writer didn't make a contract out of the synopsis. He just used it. So, he might have sent it as a gift. In contract law, if a party sends a draft without any consideration, it can't be a contract. The contract requires that both parties agree to something, and they should have some form of consideration.

So, the writer didn't state an expectation for compensation. He sent a draft, and the assistant discussed with him about his expectation. But the writer didn't make an offer for compensation. So, no mutual agreement, hence no contract.

Looking at the options, option A says the court will rule no contract because the writer didn't state his expectation. That makes sense. Because mutual agreement is needed, and the writer didn't express any expectation. The assistant mentioned she would meet with the boss, which is a mutual decision, but the writer didn't offer compensation.

Alternatively, option E says it's a unilateral contract with the producer obligated to pay only if he uses the idea. But the writer sent a draft, not an original idea. So, the contract would be based on the idea, which didn't exist. So that doesn't seem right.

Option G says the assistant lacks authority to form a contract. But the assistant is a producer's assistant, so they should have authority. So, G is probably not correct.

Option H: No terms, too indefinite. But a contract needs terms, like consideration. So, H is probably not correct.

Option D: Express contract based on mutual assent. But mutual assent would require that both parties agreed. The writer didn't make an offer for compensation. So, the mutual agreement is the issue, not mutual assent.

Option B: Implied in fact contract based on conduct. That's a stretch. Implied contracts usually rely on implied promises or promises. But I'm not sure if the mere mention of compensation without consideration counts for that.

Option C: No consideration, so no contract. That's what I was thinking earlier. Because mutual agreement requires consideration. The writer didn't offer anything, so no contract.

So, the court would rule that there's no contract because the writer didn't state an expectation for compensation, and mutual agreement wasn't made.

The court's ruling would likely be that there is no contract. The writer sent a four-page synopsis and discussed his expectation of compensation with the producer's assistant. However, the writer did not explicitly state his expectation, and there was no mutual agreement between the parties. Without mutual consideration, a contract cannot be formed. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
