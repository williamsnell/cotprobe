Okay, so I've got this problem here about compound interest. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says Mrs. Smith deposited $200 in her savings account at an interest rate of 5%, compounded semiannually. She leaves it for 5 years, and we need to find out how much she'll have at the end and how much interest she earned. The options are A through J, each with different amounts. 

Alright, I remember that compound interest involves the principal amount, the interest rate, the number of times interest is compounded per period, and the time in periods. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the accumulated amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.

So, applying the numbers here: P is $200, r is 5% or 0.05, n is 2 because it's compounded semiannually (so twice a year), and t is 5 years.

Let me plug these into the formula. A = 200*(1 + 0.05/2)^(2*5). Let's compute that step by step.

First, compute 0.05 divided by 2. That's 0.025. So inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 0.025, which equals 1.025.

Next, calculate the exponent part: 2 times 5 is 10. So it's 1.025 raised to the 10th power.

Wait, how do I calculate 1.025^10? I'm a bit rusty on exponents. Maybe I can compute it step by step. Alternatively, remembering that (1.025)^10 is approximately 1.2800845. But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, using logarithms or another method, but perhaps it's easier to use a calculator-like approach for precise calculation.

But wait, I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think—what's the value of 1.025^10. I think that 1.025^10 is about 1.2800845 as I thought. So that would be the factor.

So now, multiply that by the principal of $200.

So 200 * 1.2800845 = ?

Let me calculate that: 200 * 1.2800845 = 256.0169. So approximately $256.02. That's the amount she'll have at the end.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. 200 times 1.2800845. 200 times 1 is 200, and 200 times 0.2800845 is 56.0169. Adding them together: 200 + 56.0169 = 256.0169. So yes, $256.02.

But wait, the options don't have that. Let me look. Option E is $256.02 and $56.02 in interest. Wait, but the interest earned is the total minus principal. So $256.02 minus $200 is $56.02. So that seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the exponent. Did I calculate 1.025^10 correctly? Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise method.

Another way to compute 1.025^10 is to calculate step by step:

1.025^1 = 1.025

1.025^2 = 1.025 * 1.025 = 1.050625

1.025^3 = 1.050625 * 1.025 ≈ 1.077156

1.025^4 ≈ 1.077156 * 1.025 ≈ 1.10381289

1.025^5 ≈ 1.10381289 * 1.025 ≈ 1.13140821

1.025^6 ≈ 1.13140821 * 1.025 ≈ 1.16075452

1.025^7 ≈ 1.16075452 * 1.025 ≈ 1.19101566

1.025^8 ≈ 1.19101566 * 1.025 ≈ 1.22382263

1.025^9 ≈ 1.22382263 * 1.025 ≈ 1.2581465

1.025^10 ≈ 1.2581465 * 1.025 ≈ 1.2800845.

So yes, that's correct. So A is about $256.02.

Now, the interest earned is $256.02 - $200 = $56.02. Looking at the options, E is $256.02 and $56.02 in interest. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, checking the options again. E: 256.02 and 56.02. So that matches.

Other options: Let me quickly check one of the other options to see if any are close without being correct. For example, option B is $262.16 and 62.16. Wait, that's higher than what I calculated. How? Because 262.16 - 200 is 62.16. Let me see if that would come from a different calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the number of periods. Oh, wait, 5 years is 5 periods if compounded semiannually. So 5*2=10 periods. If I thought n was 1, that would be wrong. No, I think the calculation is correct because of 10 periods.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the interest rate. Wait, 5% per annum, compounded semiannually, so 2.5% per period. Wait, 5% / 2 is 2.5% per period. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, another thing to check: the calculation of 1.025^10. Let me use a different approach. The formula can also be written as (1 + r)^t, where r is the rate per period. So yes, 1.025^10 is the right approach.

Alternatively, if I use logarithms: ln(1.025) is approximately 0.02469. Multiply by 10: 0.2469. Then e^0.2469 is about 1.28009. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is E.
