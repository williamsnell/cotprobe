Question:

A driver and passenger were driving to work in the former's automobile one morning. As they were traveling at a speed of 20 m. p. h. (which was within the posted speed limit), the passenger suddenly pointed to an overturned vehicle along the side of the highway and said, "Look at that car upside down. " The driver turned to look at the overturned vehicle. As he was looking toward the side of the road, the driver failed to see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet in front of his approaching auto. Seconds later, the driver crashed into the rear of the abandoned auto and was injured. The jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute in effect. If the driver asserts a claim against the owner of the abandoned auto, the most likely result is that the driver will

Options:

A: recover nothing, because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.
B: recover only a portion of damages, because both the driver and the owner of the abandoned auto were negligent.
C: recover nothing, because he was distracted while driving.
D: recover all of his damages, because the owner of the abandoned auto was negligent.
E: recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.
F: recover all of his damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard.
G: recover all of his damages, because the defendant created a dangerous condition.
H: recover nothing, because he was driving at a speed that didn't allow him to stop in time.
I: recover nothing, because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let's read it carefully.

So, a driver and passenger were going to work in a car. They were driving at 20 mph, which is within the speed limit, so that's fine. Then the passenger pointed to an overturned vehicle on the side of the highway. The driver turned to look and saw the overturned one. At that point, he didn't see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire 200 feet ahead. Seconds later, he crashed into it.

The jurisdiction has a comparative negligence statute. The driver is suing the owner of the abandoned auto. The question is, what's the likely outcome for the driver's damages? The options are A to H.

Hmm. I remember that comparative negligence is when a plaintiff is liable if their harm is as severe as or greater than that of the defendant. So the question is whether the driver's negligence was enough to meet that standard.

The key here is whether the defendant's negligence caused an injury. The defendant was the owner of the vehicle with the flat tire. The driver's actions were in the course of their normal operation.

Wait, the driver was looking past a overturned vehicle, thinking it's an abandoned one. But he didn't see itâ€”so he didn't notice the flat tire. That's a possible cause of action because he failed to notice the danger. But maybe the rule is that you can't recover negligence if you were distracted.

Wait, the question is about whether the driver's action was a supervening cause. Oh, right, sometimes in comparative negligence, if the defendant's negligence caused the injury, then the plaintiff can recover. But if the plaintiff was distracted, maybe their own negligence isn't enough.

But here, the defendant's negligence was about not seeing the flat tire. So, the driver didn't see it, so he failed to notice. Is that considered negligence? Or is his negligence relative to determining the danger.

Wait, another angle: the defendant's negligence was in the course of their normal operation. So the driver was going to work, so he was aware of traffic laws, etc. So he was in a reasonable position to know that he was approaching the highway and the vehicle was an abandoned one with a flat tire.

But the driver didn't stop. So was that negligence? Or was it a failure to notice, which might fall under the definition of negligence?

Wait, wait. Oh, I remember something about the 'distracted' case. If the plaintiff is distracted, they can't recover negligence because it's not the defendant's negligence. Or is the plaintiff's negligence considered as negligence?

Wait, no. If the defendant's negligence caused the injury, then the plaintiff's own negligence (like not noticing) isn't considered negligence. So in this case, the defendant's negligence was not seeing the flat tire. The driver didn't notice. So perhaps the plaintiff's negligence (failure to notice) was not a cause of negligence.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The question is about whether the driver's claim can recover. The options are about the outcome.

In comparative negligence, if the defendant's negligence caused injury, then the plaintiff can recover. But if the plaintiff's negligence caused the injury, then the defendant can't recover because their own negligence was not considered.

In this case, the defendant's negligence was the driver not seeing the flat tire. The plaintiff's negligence was him not noticing it because of the overturned vehicle. Are these two separate incidents? Or could one be considered the cause of the other?

Alternatively, the defendant's negligence was their own negligence in the course of their operation, which caused the accident. So the plaintiff's actions (noticing, etc.) are not considered negligence against the defendant. So the defendant's negligence (failure to see) caused the accident. Therefore, the plaintiff's negligence (noticing) is not a cause of liability.

Wait, but wait. Another point: the defendant was in a position where they should have noticed. So the plaintiff's failure to notice could be a separate cause of negligence. But in comparative negligence, the plaintiff can only recover if their own negligence was a cause of the injury. If the defendant's negligence caused it, then the plaintiff's negligence isn't considered.

But here, the defendant's negligence was the driver not seeing the flat tire. The plaintiff's negligence was him not noticing it because of the overturned vehicle. So, the defendant's negligence (not seeing the flat tire) caused the accident. The plaintiff's failure to notice (because of the overturned vehicle) might not be the same as the defendant's negligence.

Alternatively, perhaps the plaintiff's failure to notice is considered negligence because the defendant's negligence was that of not seeing the danger.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about common law vs. comparative negligence.

In common law, a plaintiff can be held liable for negligence if the defendant's negligence caused the injury. If the plaintiff was distracted, then they can't recover because it's not the defendant's fault.

Wait, no. In common law, the plaintiff's own negligence is not considered unless the defendant's negligence caused the injury. So if the plaintiff was distracted, they can't recover because their own negligence wasn't considered. But here, the question is about comparative negligence.

Wait, the jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute. So, that would mean that if the plaintiff's own negligence (or certain types) caused the injury, then the defendant can't recover.

So, if the defendant's negligence (failure to see the flat tire) caused the accident, then the plaintiff's failure to notice (which is a separate action) is not considered negligence against the defendant.

Wait, but the defendant's negligence was about the driver not seeing the flat tire. So the plaintiff's failure to notice is a separate event. So, in this case, the defendant's negligence (not seeing the flat tire) caused the accident. Therefore, the plaintiff's negligence (not seeing it because of the overturned vehicle) is not the same as the defendant's negligence.

Wait, but maybe the driver didn't notice because he thought it was an overturned vehicle, which is an accident itself. So the driver didn't see the flat tire, but he thought the vehicle was overturned. So the defendant's negligence was not seeing the flat tire, but the plaintiff's failure to notice was because of the overturned vehicle. So perhaps the plaintiff's failure to notice is not the same as the defendant's negligence.

Alternatively, perhaps the driver's actions (i.e., not seeing the flat tire) are the same as the defendant's negligence. Because the defendant's negligence was that the driver didn't see the flat tire. So the plaintiff's failure to see was not a separate negligence, but perhaps a result of the defendant's negligence.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it reversed. Let me approach it from the standpoint of negligence.

If the defendant's negligence (failure to see the flat tire) caused the accident, then the plaintiff cannot recover because their own negligence (failure to notice) is not considered as negligence against the defendant.

Wait, but the question is about whether the driver will recover. The options are about the outcome.

Option E says the driver gets only a portion of the damages because he was distracted. So, if the plaintiff is distracted, they can't recover even if their actions were negligent because it's not the defendant's fault.

So, if the plaintiff's actions (not seeing the flat tire) were because of the driver's distraction, then they can't recover.

Looking at the options, option E says "recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard."

Wait, but the defendant's negligence was about the driver not seeing the flat tire. The driver was in the course of his normal operation, so his failure to see was negligence.

But if the defendant's negligence caused the accident, then the plaintiff can't recover. So, in this case, the driver's failure to see the flat tire (which is the defendant's negligence) caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't claim.

Wait, no, the defendant's negligence was his failure to see. So the plaintiff's failure to see is not considered negligence against the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff can't recover.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me think again.

The defendant's negligence was his failure to see the flat tire. The plaintiff's failure to see it because of the overturned vehicle. So the plaintiff's failure to see the flat tire is a separate event. But if the defendant's failure to see caused the accident, then the plaintiff can't recover because he wasn't negligent against the defendant.

Wait, perhaps the driver didn't see the flat tire because he was distracted. So if the plaintiff was distracted, he can't recover even if he was negligent.

So, in this scenario, the driver was in the course of his normal operation. The fact that he didn't stop and drive slowly (but was distracted) would not be a negligence. So, perhaps the driver's own negligence was not enough.

Wait, but if the defendant's negligence caused the accident, then the plaintiff's negligence isn't considered. So the driver's failure to see the flat tire (the defendant's negligence) caused the accident. Therefore, the plaintiff's own negligence (failure to see it because of the overturned vehicle) is not the same as the defendant's negligence, so the plaintiff can't recover.

Wait, but if the defendant's negligence was about not seeing the flat tire, then the plaintiff's failure to notice the overturned vehicle is a separate thing. So, in that case, perhaps the plaintiff's failure to see was not negligence against the defendant. Therefore, the defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't recover.

In that case, the driver would not recover because he was not negligent enough.

Looking at the options, the options:

A: recover nothing because passenger was a supervening cause. (I think a passenger's accident is considered a supervening cause for negligence.)

B: recover only portion because both negligence; maybe not.

C: nothing because he was distracted. (If distracted, can't recover.)

D: recover all because defendant was negligent. (Yes, because the defendant's negligence caused the accident.)

E: recover only a portion because the auto was traffic hazard. So, the defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't recover.

Wait, so if the defendant's negligence caused the accident, then the plaintiff can't recover anything. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but another point: the defendant's negligence was about not seeing the flat tire. The plaintiff's failure to see it because of the overturned vehicle is not the same as the defendant's negligence. So, perhaps the plaintiff's failure to see is not a negligence against the defendant. Therefore, the defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't recover.

So the options, option E says "recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard." Wait, no, E says that the defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't recover. So, if the defendant's negligence caused the accident, the plaintiff can't recover.

So, that would mean option E is correct. So the driver can't recover anything.

Wait, but another way: if the defendant's negligence caused the accident, then the plaintiff can't recover. So, the driver can't recover. So, the answer would be E.

Alternatively, is the defendant's negligence sufficient to cause the accident? The driver didn't see the flat tire, so the accident happened because the driver didn't notice it. So the accident was caused by the driver's negligence (failure to see), so the defendant's negligence (failure to see) caused the accident.

Therefore, the plaintiff cannot recover because his own negligence (failure to notice) is not considered against the defendant's negligence.

So, the answer is E: recover only a portion because the auto was a traffic hazard.

Wait, but the options: looking back:

E: recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard.

Wait, but in the situation, the defendant's negligence was about not seeing the flat tire, which is a separate event. So the defendant's negligence caused the accident. So the plaintiff can't recover.

Therefore, the correct outcome is that the driver cannot recover anything. So which option is that? Let's look.

Option A: recover nothing because passenger was supervening.

Option E: only a portion because traffic hazard.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't recover anything. So the correct option is E or A?

Wait, if the plaintiff was distracted, they can't recover, regardless of negligence. So, if the driver was distracted, the answer is E. But in this scenario, the driver was in a position to see the flat tire. So his failure to see was negligence against the defendant's negligence, not because he was distracted.

Wait, but the question is whether the driver's claim is based on whether he was distracted, or if the defendant's negligence caused the accident.

So, if the driver's negligence (failure to see) was enough to cause the accident, then the plaintiff can't recover. So, the correct outcome is E.

So, the options are about the outcome. If the driver can't recover, he can't claim.

So, the correct answer is option A: recover nothing because passenger was supervening. Or perhaps E.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me recap: The defendant's negligence (not seeing the flat tire) caused the accident. So, the plaintiff can't recover anything because their own negligence (failure to see) isn't considered against the defendant's negligence. So, the answer is E: only a portion because the auto was a traffic hazard.

Wait, but the options: E says "recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard." So, the defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't recover.

So, the correct answer is E.

Wait, but option A says the passenger's act was a supervening cause. In some cases, if a passenger is in the way, their accident is considered a supervening cause. So, if the driver didn't see the passenger's vehicle, the accident was a supervening cause. So the plaintiff could recover based on that. But in this case, the passenger's vehicle is overturned, not the driver's. So, the defendant's failure to see the flat tire is the issue.

Wait, the accident is caused by the driver's failure to see the flat tire. So, the defendant's negligence (failure to see) is what caused the accident. Therefore, the plaintiff can't claim negligence against the defendant.

So the answer is E: he can only get a portion because the auto was a traffic hazard (so the accident was caused by the driver's negligence).

Wait, but the driver didn't see the flat tire because he was distracted. So, the driver's fault is his negligence, not the defendant's.

Wait, no, because the defendant's negligence was about not seeing the flat tire. The driver's failure to see was negligence. So, the accident was caused by the driver's negligence, so the defendant's negligence (failure to see) caused the accident.

Therefore, the plaintiff cannot recover anything because his own negligence (failure to see) isn't considered against the defendant's negligence.

So, the correct outcome is that the driver can't recover anything. So, the answer is E: only a portion because the auto was a traffic hazard.

Wait, but option E says "recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard." Hmm, or is it that the defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't recover anything.

Wait, the options:

A: recover nothing because passenger's act was a supervening cause.

B: only portion because both were negligent.

C: only nothing because distracted.

D: recover all because defendant negligent.

E: only portion because auto was traffic hazard.

I think the answer is E, because the defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff can't recover.

The question revolves around whether the driver can recover damages for an accident caused by an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire. The jurisdiction has a comparative negligence statute, meaning the driver's claim will succeed only if the defendant's negligence caused the injury. 

The driver failed to see the flat tire because of an overturned vehicle, which is an accident itself. The defendant's negligence was about not seeing the flat tire, which caused the accident. The key issue is whether the plaintiff's failure to notice the overturned vehicle falls under the defendant's negligence or if it was a separate event.

The defendant's negligence (failure to see the flat tire) directly caused the accident, so the plaintiff cannot recover damages against the defendant. This means the driver cannot claim negligence based on the defendant's negligence. Additionally, the driver was in a position of normal operation, and his failure to stop was not considered negligence.

Analyzing the options:

- **A:** Incorrect. The passenger's act was not a supervening cause because the accident was caused by the driver's failure to see the flat tire, not the passenger's overturned vehicle.
- **B:** Incorrect. The plaintiff was not entirely negligent; his failure to notice the overturned vehicle was not the same as the defendant's negligence.
- **C:** Incorrect. The driver was not distracted; his failure to see the flat tire was negligence against the defendant.
- **D:** Incorrect. The defendant's negligence caused the accident, so the plaintiff cannot recover all damages.
- **E:** Correct. The driver cannot recover anything because the defendant's negligence (failure to see the flat tire) caused the accident, and the plaintiff's failure to notice was not considered negligence against the defendant.
