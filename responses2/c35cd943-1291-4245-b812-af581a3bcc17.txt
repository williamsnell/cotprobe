Okay, so I've got this differential equation here: t² y'' - 2 y' + (3 + t) y = 0. And I'm told that y₁ and y₂ are a fundamental set of solutions. I need to find W(y₁, y₂)(4), given that W(y₁, y₂)(2) = 3. Hmm, right. 

Wait, the Wronskian. Oh yeah, the Wronskian of two solutions is y₁ y₂' - y₁' y₂. I remember that for linear differential equations, the Wronskian can be related to the coefficient of y', which often comes into play with methods like reduction of order or variation of parameters.

The differential equation is a second-order linear ODE, so I think I can use Abel's theorem here. Abel's theorem relates the Wronskian at a point to the integral of something involving the coefficients. Wait, more precisely, for an equation of the form y'' + P(t) y' + Q(t) y = 0, the Wronskian satisfies W' = -P(t) W.

But wait, in our equation, it's t² y'' - 2 y' + (3 + t) y = 0. Let me write it in standard form. So, dividing both sides by t², we get:

y'' - (2/t²) y' + (3 + t)/t² y = 0.

So, P(t) is the coefficient of y', which is -2/t². Then, according to Abel's theorem, the derivative of the Wronskian W' = -P(t) W.

Wait, no: wait, let me think again. The standard form is y'' + P y' + Q y = 0. Then, W' = -P W, where P is the coefficient of y'. So in this case, P(t) is (-2/t²), so W' = -P(t) W = (2/t²) W.

Wait, no. Wait, if the equation is y'' + P y' + Q y = 0, then W' = -(P) W. In our case, after dividing by t², the equation becomes y'' + (-2/t²) y' + (3 + t)/t² y = 0. So P(t) is -2/t². Therefore, W' = -P(t) W = (2/t²) W. Wait, that can't be right because that would mean W' is positive when P is negative.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the sign wrong. Let me double-check. The standard form is y'' + P(t) y' + Q(t) y = 0. Then, the Wronskian satisfies W' = -P(t) W.

In our case, P(t) is -2/t², so W' = -P(t) W = (2/t²) W. So that's correct. So W' = (2/t²) W.

Wait, no. Wait, if in the standard form y'' + P y' + Q y = 0, then W' = -P W. So in our equation, P is -2/t². So W' = -P W = -(-2/t²) W = (2/t²) W. So yes, W' = (2/t²) W.

But then, this is a differential equation for W. So dW/dt = (2/t²) W.

We can write this as dW/W = (2/t²) dt. So integrating both sides, ln W = -2/t + C, so W = C e^{-2/t}.

Wait, but wait a second. That would mean the Wronskian is proportional to e^{-2/t}. But let me check the initial condition. At t = 2, W(2) = 3. So let's plug in t=2 into the equation.

So W(t) = C e^{-2/t}, and at t=2, W(2)=3 = C e^{-2/(2)} = C e^{-1}. So C = 3 e^{1} = 3e.

So W(t) = 3e * e^{-2/t} = 3 e^{( -2/t + 1 ) }.

Alternatively, W(t) = 3 e^{ (t - 2)/t }.

Wait, let me compute that more precisely. Let's see: e^{-2/t} is e^{-2/t}, and multiplied by 3e, which is 3e^{1}.

So 3e^{1} * e^{-2/t} = 3 e^{1 - 2/t}.

Alternatively, 3 e^{(t - 2)/t}.

But perhaps it's better to keep it as W(t) = 3 e^{(t - 2)/t}.

Wait, but let's double-check. Because when I integrate, I get ln W = ∫ (2/t²) dt + C, which is ∫ 2 t^{-2} dt = -2 t^{-1} + C. So ln W = -2/t + C, so W = C e^{-2/t}.

So, using W(2)=3, we have 3 = C e^{-2/2} = C e^{-1}, so C = 3 e.

So W(t) = 3 e * e^{-2/t} = 3 e^{1 - 2/t}.

Alternatively, W(t) = 3 e^{(t - 2)/t}.

Wait, perhaps we can write it as 3 e^{(t - 2)/t} = 3 e^{1 - 2/t} = 3 e * e^{-2/t}.

Now, the question wants W(4). So plug t=4.

W(4) = 3 e^{(4 - 2)/4} = 3 e^{2/4} = 3 e^{1/2} ≈ 3 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.946.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option H is 5.276, and option I is 4.000. Hmm, 4.946 is option I. But wait, in the options given, option I is 4.000, which is 4.000, but 3 e^{1/2} is approximately 4.946, which isn't exactly any of the options. Wait, let me compute 3 * e^{0.5} more accurately. e^0.5 is approximately 1.64872. So 3 * 1.64872 is approximately 4.946. Looking at the options, I is 4.000, which is 4.000, and H is 5.276. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration step.

Wait, let me go back through the steps because that would mean I have to re-examine my process.

The differential equation is t² y'' - 2 y' + (3 + t) y = 0. To apply Abel's theorem, we first write the equation in standard form y'' + P(t) y' + Q(t) y = 0.

Dividing by t²: y'' - (2/t²) y' + (3 + t)/t² y = 0.

So, P(t) is the coefficient of y', which is -2/t². Then, according to Abel's formula, W' = -P(t) W. So W' = -(-2/t²) W = (2/t²) W.

So, W' = (2/t²) W.

So, the ODE for W is dW/dt = (2/t²) W.

We can solve this ODE. Let's rewrite it as dW/W = (2/t²) dt.

Integrating both sides: ln W = ∫ (2/t²) dt + C.

∫ (2/t²) dt = 2 ∫ t^{-2} dt = 2*( -1/t ) + C = -2/t + C.

So, ln W = -2/t + C → W = C e^{-2/t}.

Now, apply the initial condition W(2)=3.

At t=2, W=3: 3 = C e^{-2/2} → 3 = C e^{-1} → C = 3 e.

So W(t) = 3 e * e^{-2/t} = 3 e^{1 - 2/t}.

At t=4, W(4)=3 e^{1 - 2/4}=3 e^{1 - 0.5}=3 e^{0.5} ≈ 3 * 1.6487 ≈4.946.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.000, and option H is 5.276. So 4.946 isn't exactly an option. Hmmm. Did I make a mistake in the integration? Let me check.

Wait, maybe I messed up the sign somewhere. Let me re-express the ODE for W. W' = (2/t²) W.

Which is a linear ODE, and can be solved as:

W(t) = W(2) * exp( ∫ (2/t²) dt from 2 to t )

Wait, wait, the integral from 2 to t of (2/t²) dt would be [ -2/t ] evaluated from 2 to t.

So, ∫ from 2 to t of 2/t² dt = [ -2/t ] at t minus at 2 → (-2/t) - (-2/2) )= (-2/t) +1.

So, W(t) = W(2) * exp( (-2/t) +1 ) = 3 * e^{1 - 2/t}.

Which is the same as before. So W(4) = 3 e^{1 - 2/4} = 3 e^{0.5} ≈4.946.

But this is not an option here. The options given are A:6.125, B:6.673, C:2.618, D:4.946, E:5.789, F:3.141, G:3.876, H:5.276, I:4.000, J:7.204.

Wait, option D is 4.946, which matches our calculation. So why is my initial thought that the answer could be 4.946, but the options include I as 4.000. Maybe I made a mistake in the integration process.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when applying Abel's theorem. Let me re-examine that.

The standard form is y'' + P y' + Q y = 0. So in our case, after dividing by t², the equation is y'' + (-2/t²) y' + (3 + t)/t² y = 0. So P(t) is -2/t². So then, according to Abel's theorem, W' = -P(t) W. So W' = -(-2/t²) W = (2/t²) W. So that part is correct. So the ODE is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration? Let me check the integral again.

∫ (2/t²) dt = ∫ 2 t^{-2} dt = 2 * (-1/t) + C = -2/t + C.

So, W(t) = W(2) * e^{∫ (2/t²) dt} from 2 to t.

Wait, no. The general solution is W(t) = W(2) * exp( ∫ from 2 to t of (2/t²) dt ).

So, because ∫ (2/t²) dt is -2/t + C, the definite integral from 2 to t is [ -2/t ] - [ -2/2 ] = (-2/t) +1.

So, W(t) = 3 * e^{( -2/t +1 ) } = 3 e^{1 - 2/t}.

So at t=4, W(4)=3 e^{1 - 2/4}=3 e^{0.5} ≈4.946.

But looking at the options, D is 4.946. So why isn't it an option? Because in the original problem statement, the options are A to J, with D being 4.946, which is exactly what I got.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the application of Abel's theorem. Let me think again about the formula. The formula is W' = -P W, where P is the coefficient of y' in the equation.

Wait, wait, in our equation after dividing by t², the coefficient of y' is (-2/t²). So P = (-2/t²). So W' = -P W = -(-2/t²) W = (2/t²) W. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the sign is different. Let me make sure that the formula is correctly applied. For the equation y'' + P y' + Q y =0, the Wronskian satisfies W' = -P W. So in our case, since P is -2/t², W' = -(-2/t²) W = (2/t²) W. So that's correct.

Hmm. So why isn't D the correct answer? Because according to my calculation, D is 4.946, which is option D. However, I just realized that perhaps I forgot to consider that the Wronskian is a multiplicative factor in the general solution. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the reduction of order method or something else, but I think the Wronskian approach should be correct.

Wait, another thought: since the Wronskian is given, perhaps we can relate it to the solutions of the differential equation. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute W(t) again.

W(t) = 3 e^{∫ (2/t²) dt} from 2 to t.

∫ (2/t²) dt = ∫ 2 t^{-2} dt = 2*(-1/t) + C = -2/t + C.

The definite integral from 2 to t is (-2/t) - (-2/2) = (-2/t) +1.

So, exponent is 1 - 2/t.

So W(t) = 3 e^{1 - 2/t}.

So at t=4, it's 3 e^{1 - 0.5} = 3 e^{0.5} ≈3 * 1.6487≈4.946.

Which is option D. So I think I must have made a mistake in the options' labels. Wait, looking back at the options given: 

A:6.125

B:6.673

C:2.618

D:4.946

E:5.789

F:3.141

G:3.876

H:5.276

I:4.000

J:7.204

So option D is 4.946, which matches my calculation. So why did I think the answer was I? Because when I first computed, I thought I was getting 4.946, which is D, but perhaps in the initial setup I had a mistake that was leading me to think it was 4.000.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial condition. Oh wait, the problem says that W(y₁, y₂)(2)=3. So when t=2, W=3.

But let me check my integration again. So, W(t) = 3 e^{1 - 2/t}.

Wait, perhaps I should compute W(t) at t=4:

W(4) = 3 * e^{1 - 2/4} = 3 e^{1 - 0.5} = 3 e^{0.5}.

e^{0.5} is approximately 1.6487, so 3 *1.6487≈4.946. So that's correct.

But in the options, option D is 4.946. So I think the correct answer is D. But why did I think the first answer was I? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when applying the initial condition. Let me check.

Wait, no, because at t=2, W=3, which is because 3 e^{1 - 2/2} = 3 e^{0} =3.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the Wronskian at t=4 is approximately 4.946, which is option D.

But the problem statement says that W(y₁,y₂)(2)=3, and we're to find W(y₁,y₂)(4). So according to the calculations, the answer is D.

Wait, but in the options, there is an option I which is 4.000. But according to my calculation, it's 4.946, which is D. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the integrating factor approach for the Wronskian instead of directly integrating.

Wait, the standard form is y'' + P y' + Q y = 0. Then, for the Wronskian, W' = -P W.

In our case, P is -2/t², so W' = (2/t²) W.

So, integrating factor is e^{∫ (2/t²) dt} = e^{-2/t}.

So W(t) = W(2) * e^{∫ (2/t²) dt from 2 to t}.

Wait, but let me think about this. The integrating factor for linear equations is usually e^{∫ P(t) dt}, but perhaps I'm confusing that with the integrating factor in the standard form.

Alternatively, perhaps the integrating factor is e^{∫ P(t) dt}, which is e^{-2/t}.

So to find W(t) = W(2) * e^{∫ (from 2 to t) P(t) dt}.

But wait, the integral is ∫ (2/t²) dt from 2 to t is [ -2/t ] from 2 to t.

Which gives (-2/t) - (-2/2) )= (-2/t) +1.

So, the exponent is 1 - 2/t, same as before.

So, W(t)=3 e^{1 - 2/t}.

Which is the same as before.

So, when t=4, W(4)=3 e^{1 - 2/4}=3 e^{0.5}≈4.946.

So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the options given are:

A:6.125

B:6.673

C:2.618

D:4.946

E:5.789

F:3.141

G:3.876

H:5.276

I:4.000

J:7.204

So, D is 4.946, which is exactly what I'm getting. So maybe the answer is D. But why did I think it's I? Because perhaps in the initial steps, I forgot to apply the correct sign or made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent sign.

Wait, in the integral, ∫ (2/t²) dt from 2 to t is [ -2/t ] evaluated from 2 to t.

So, at t, it's -2/t.

At 2, it's -2/2 = -1.

So the definite integral is (-2/t) - (-1) = (-2/t +1 )= (1 - 2/t).

So the exponent is (1 - 2/t), so W(t)=3 e^{1 - 2/t}.

Which is correct.

So at t=4, it's 3 e^{1 - 0.5}=3 e^{0.5}≈4.946, which is D.

So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, it says "find W(y₁, y₂)(4)" given that W(y₁,y₂)(2)=3. So according to my calculation, it's 4.946, which is D.

So perhaps the initial thought of D being correct is correct. So I think the answer is D.

Wait, but the options are given as:

A:6.125

B:6.673

C:2.618

D:4.946

E:5.789

F:3.141

G:3.876

H:5.276

I:4.000

J:7.204

So, the correct answer is D, 4.946.

So I think I made a mistake in the initial steps by confusing something else, but in the end, the correct answer is D.
</think>

To determine the Wronskian \( W(y_1, y_2)(4) \) given \( W(y_1, y_2)(2) = 3 \), we use Abel's theorem. For the differential equation \( t^2 y'' - 2 y' + (3 + t) y = 0 \), we rewrite it in standard form:

\[
y'' - \frac{2}{t^2} y' + \frac{3 + t}{t^2} y = 0.
\]

Here, \( P(t) = -\frac{2}{t^2} \). According to Abel's theorem, the Wronskian satisfies:

\[
W'(t) = -P(t) W(t) = \frac{2}{t^2} W(t).
\]

This is a separable differential equation, leading to:

\[
\ln W(t) = \int \frac{2}{t^2} dt + C = -\frac{2}{t} + C.
\]

Thus,

\[
W(t) = C e^{-\frac{2}{t}}.
\]

Using the initial condition \( W(2) = 3 \):

\[
3 = C e^{-1} \implies C = 3 e.
\]

Therefore, the Wronskian is:

\[
W(t) = 3 e \cdot e^{-\frac{2}{t}} = 3 e^{1 - \frac{2}{t}}.
\]

Evaluating at \( t = 4 \):

\[
W(4) = 3 e^{1 - \frac{2}{4}} = 3 e^{0.5} \approx 3 \times 1.6487 \approx 4.946.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: D**
