Okay, so I've got this question about Aquinas and his views on pleasure and operation. Hmm, I remember that Aquinas was a medieval philosopher, so I should be thinking about his thought on ethics and philosophy.

The question says, "Aquinas claims that:" and then gives several options. The options are about whether pleasure and operation exist for their own sake or if they're related. I think the key here is understanding Aquinas' views on these concepts.

I recall that Aquinas, particularly in his work "Summa Theologica," discussed the relationship between pleasure and action. He was a rationalist, which means he believed in the natural ordering of things. So, he probably thought that pleasure and action are interconnected. 

Wait, so he might have believed that pleasure is an end in itself, not just something that comes from action. Like, he might have thought that the most fulfilling experiences are those where pleasure is the primary reason for the action. So, for example, when you're in a beautiful place, the pleasure you feel is the reason you decide to go there. That would mean that pleasure and operation are linked.

Also, I think he might have considered that pleasure is independent of the act of feeling it. Like, you can have pleasure without engaging in the action that causes it. So, the pleasure is what makes you want to do something, but the act itself is separate.

So looking at the options, option G says pleasure and operation exist for their own sake, which might not be correct. Because the question is about what Aquinas claims. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, option D says both a and c. Option G is about them existing for their own sake, which maybe he didn't. So perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, another angle: option A says pleasure exists for the sake of operation. That doesn't sound right because I thought that's more about the action causing the pleasure, not the pleasure being the reason for the action.

Option B says operation exists for pleasure. That doesn't make sense because the operation is the action, and the pleasure is the result, not the reason. So B is incorrect.

Option C says both b and c. Wait, I'm not sure about that. I think c might be about the operation being for pleasure, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps option G is correct because Aquinas might have thought that pleasure is independent, and that the act is a necessary condition for it. So both exist, but one for the sake of the other.

Wait, let me clarify. The options are:

A: pleasure exists for the sake of operation.

B: operation exists for the sake of pleasure.

C: both b and c.

D: both a and c.

E: neither operation nor pleasure exist for their own sake.

F: both a and b.

G: pleasure and operation exist for their own sake.

H: operation exists for its own sake.

I: operation and pleasure exist independently of each other.

J: pleasure exists for its own sake.

Wait, from what I remember, Aquinas might have thought that the pleasure is an end in itself, so pleasure exists for its own sake, and the act is a necessary condition for it. So pleasure is an end, and the act is a means. So that would mean that both exist for their own sake. So option G is correct.

Wait, but what about option D? D says both a and c. Option C is "both b and c" which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option.

Option A: a: pleasure exists for the sake of operation. So, does pleasure exist for the reason we do it? I think that's the other way around. The pleasure is the result, not the reason.

Option B: operation exists for the sake of pleasure. That doesn't sound right either. The act is the means, not the reason for the end (pleasure).

Option C: both b and c. I'm not sure what c refers to. Maybe option G is the correct answer because it's about both existing for their own sake.

Option D: both a and c. Maybe a is correct, and c is about the operation being for pleasure, which I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: If both pleasure and operation exist for their own sake, that's option G. But I'm uncertain because I thought that the act is a necessary condition for the pleasure, not the other way around.

So, if I recall correctly, Aquinas might have thought that pleasure is an end, and the act is necessary for it. So, both exist for their own sake. So option G is correct.

Aquinas' views on pleasure and operation hinge on understanding his rationalist stance. He believed that pleasure and action are interconnected, with pleasure being an end in itself, and the act being a necessary condition for it. This suggests that both pleasure and operation exist for their own sake. 

Analyzing the options:

- **G** states that both pleasure and operation exist for their own sake, aligning with Aquinas' understanding.
- Other options either suggest one is the cause of the other or incorrectly attribute causation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: pleasure and operation exist for their own sake.

Answer: G
