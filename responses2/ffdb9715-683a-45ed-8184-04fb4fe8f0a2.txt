Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about a newly discovered planet. Hmm. The problem states that this planet has twice the density of Earth, but the acceleration due to gravity on its surface is the same as Earth's. And I need to find its radius. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on a planet's surface can be calculated using the formula g = G*M/(r²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is its radius. Oh right, and the mass of a planet is related to its density and volume. Since density (rho) is mass over volume, and the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so M = rho * (4/3)πr³.

So, putting that into the gravity formula, g = G*(rho*(4/3)πr³)/(r²) = (4/3)π G rho r. Oh wait, that simplifies to g = (G*M/(r²)) as I thought earlier, which is the same thing.

So, the problem says the planet has twice the density of Earth. Let me denote Earth's density as rho_earth, so the planet's density rho_planet = 2 rho_earth.

The gravity on the planet is equal to Earth's gravity. So, g_planet = g_earth.

Let me write that in terms of their respective densities and radii. So:

g_earth = (4/3) π G rho_earth r_earth²
g_planet = (4/3) π G rho_planet r_planet²

Since g_planet equals g_earth, we can set them equal:

(4/3) π G rho_earth r_earth² = (4/3) π G rho_planet r_planet²

Hmm, the (4/3) and π G terms are the same on both sides, so they cancel out. That leaves:

rho_earth * r_earth² = rho_planet * r_planet².

We can plug in rho_planet as 2 rho_earth:

rho_earth * r_earth² = 2 rho_earth * r_planet²

Oh, the rho_earth terms cancel out on both sides:

r_earth² = 2 r_planet²

Wait, wait. Let me rearrange that equation. If we have r_earth² = 2 r_planet², then we can write r_planet² = (r_earth²)/2.

Taking the square root of both sides:

r_planet = r_earth / sqrt(2)

Hmm, that gives me the radius in terms of Earth's radius. But wait, the problem gives the planet's density twice Earth's, but the gravity is the same. So, according to this, the radius would be smaller than Earth's? But that's conflicting with my intuition because if density is higher, I thought the radius would be smaller, but maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the setup. The planet has twice the density, but same gravity as Earth. So, maybe the radius is actually smaller than Earth's? Let me think.

Wait, no. Wait, if a planet has a higher density, but the same gravity, then perhaps the radius is smaller. Because if density is higher, for the same mass, the radius would be smaller. But in this problem, the mass isn't directly given. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Let's express the density in terms of mass and volume. Density is mass divided by volume. So, if the planet's density is twice that of Earth, and the gravity is same, let's see.

Density (rho) = M/( (4/3) pi r³ )

So, for the planet: rho_planet = 2 rho_earth = (M_planet) / ( (4/3) pi r_planet³ )

Similarly, for Earth: rho_earth = (M_earth) / ( (4/3) pi r_earth³ )

So, if I set the two expressions for rho_planet and rho_earth, and since rho_planet is twice rho_earth, then:

2 rho_earth = (M_p) / ( (4/3) pi r_p³ )

But M_p = (4/3 pi r_p³) * rho_p = (4/3 pi r_p³) * 2 rho_earth.

So, M_p = 2 * (4/3 pi r_p³) rho_earth = 2 M_earth * (r_p³ / r_earth³), because M_earth = (4/3 pi r_earth³) rho_earth.

Wait, because M_earth = (4/3) pi r_earth³ rho_earth.

So, M_p = 2 * (4/3 pi r_p³) rho_earth = 2 * (r_p^3 / r_earth^3) * (4/3 pi rho_earth r_earth³) )

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Let me think about it another way.

We have density of planet: rho_p = 2 rho_earth.

So, rho_p = (M_p) / ( (4/3) pi r_p³ )

Similarly, rho_earth = M_earth/( (4/3) pi r_earth³ )

So, substituting M_p:

rho_p = ( (4/3 pi r_p³ * rho_earth) ) / ( (4/3) pi r_p³ ) ) → Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, because M_p is (4/3 pi r_p³) rho_p. So, substituting:

rho_p = M_p / ( (4/3 pi r_p³) )

But M_p is (4/3 pi r_p³) * rho_p → so that just cancels. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Since g = G M / r², and g is the same for both planets.

So, for Earth: g_earth = G M_earth / r_earth²

For the planet: g_planet = G M_p / r_planet²

Since g_planet = g_earth, so:

G M_earth / r_earth² = G M_p / r_planet²

Cancel G's:

M_earth / r_earth² = M_p / r_planet²

But M_p is (4/3 pi r_p³ rho_p )

Wait, but rho_p = 2 rho_earth, and M_earth = (4/3 pi r_earth³ rho_earth )

So, M_p = (4/3 pi r_p³ * 2 rho_earth )

But M_earth is (4/3 pi r_earth³ rho_earth ), so M_p = 2 (r_p³ / r_earth³ ) * M_earth.

So, substituting M_p into the equation:

M_earth / r_earth² = [ 2 (r_p³ / r_earth³) M_earth ] / r_planet²

Divide both sides by M_earth (assuming it's non-zero):

1 / r_earth² = [ 2 (r_p³ / r_earth³) ] / r_planet²

Multiply both sides by r_earth³:

r_earth / 1 = 2 r_p³ / r_planet²

So, r_earth = (2 r_p³) / r_planet²

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe rearrange the equation.

From earlier, 1/r_earth² = (2 r_p³) / (r_earth³ r_planet² )

Wait, no, let me go back. Let's see:

After substitution:

1/(r_earth²) = [ 2 (r_p³) / (r_earth³ r_planet²) ) ]

Multiply both sides by (r_earth³ r_planet²):

r_earth³ * r_planet² / r_earth² = 2 r_p³

Which simplifies to:

r_earth * r_planet² = 2 r_p³

Wait, but wait, r_p is the radius of the planet, r_planet.

But here, we have r_earth * r_planet² = 2 r_p³.

Hmm, but I'm trying to solve for r_p. Let's see.

r_earth * r_planet² = 2 r_p³ → r_p³ = (r_earth r_planet² ) / 2.

But I don't know r_p here, so perhaps this approach isn't helping. Maybe I should go back to the earlier approach, where I tried to relate the densities and radii.

Alternative approach: Let me use the formula for gravity.

g = G*(4/3 pi rho r³) / r² → g = (4/3) pi G rho r.

So, for Earth:

g_earth = (4/3) pi G rho_earth r_earth.

Similarly, for the planet:

g_planet = (4/3) pi G rho_planet r_planet.

Given that g_planet = g_earth, so:

(4/3 pi G rho_planet r_planet ) = (4/3 pi G rho_earth r_earth )

Canceling terms,

rho_planet r_planet = rho_earth r_earth.

But rho_planet is 2 rho_earth.

So,

(2 rho_earth) r_planet = rho_earth r_earth

Divide both sides by rho_earth (assuming it's non-zero):

2 r_planet = r_earth

So, r_planet = r_earth / 2.

Wait, that's a big difference. So the radius is half of Earth's. But I thought if density is higher, the radius would be smaller. Wait, but no, because the density is higher, but the gravitational acceleration is same. Hmm, but wait, if the density is higher, but the radius is smaller, then the planet would have a higher density but smaller volume. But the gravity would depend on both mass and radius.

Wait, let's think about Earth. Its density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. If this planet had twice that, 11 g/cm³, but same gravity.

But according to this calculation, the radius is half. So, that would be 6.371e6 meters (Earth's radius is about 6.37e6 m) divided by 2, which would be approximately 3.185e6 m. Looking at the options, option B is 3.19e6, which is very close.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A: 2.84e6

B: 3.19e6

C: 5.12e6

D:9e6

E:6.38e6

F:8.34e6

G:2e6

H:7.56e6

I:4.77e6

J:1.59e6

So, option B is 3.19e6 m, which is 6.37e6 / 2.

So, the radius is half of Earth's. Because the density is doubled, but the gravitational acceleration remains the same. So, in this case, the planet's radius is smaller. So, the correct option is B.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by using the formula for gravitational acceleration on the surface of a planet, which is given by:

\[
g = \frac{G M}{r^2}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the planet, and \( r \) is its radius. The mass of a planet can also be expressed in terms of its density and volume:

\[
M = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Substituting this into the formula for \( g \), we get:

\[
g = \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho r
\]

Since the problem states that the planet has twice the density of Earth (\( \rho_{\text{planet}} = 2 \rho_{\text{Earth}} \)) and the gravitational acceleration is the same as Earth's (\( g_{\text{planet}} = g_{\text{Earth}} \)), we equate the two expressions:

\[
\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho_{\text{Earth}} r_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi G (2 \rho_{\text{Earth}}) r_{\text{planet}}
\]

Canceling the common factors (\( \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho_{\text{Earth}} \)) from both sides, we get:

\[
r_{\text{Earth}} = 2 r_{\text{planet}}
\]

This implies:

\[
r_{\text{planet}} = \frac{r_{\text{Earth}}}{2}
\]

The radius of Earth is approximately \( 6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \). Substituting this value:

\[
r_{\text{planet}} = \frac{6.37 \times 10^6}{2} = 3.185 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}
\]

This corresponds to **Option B**. The key insight is that doubling the density leads to a smaller radius to maintain the same gravitational acceleration, as the radius depends inversely on the density.
