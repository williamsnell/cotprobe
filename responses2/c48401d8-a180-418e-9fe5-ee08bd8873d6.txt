Question:

"The price level generally begins to rise before full employment is reached. At full employment , ad-ditional spending tends to be purely inflationary ".

Options:

A: Prices rise as economy approaches full employment because resources are not fully employed simultaneously in all industries
B: Resources are fully employed simultaneously in all industries
C: At full employment, additional spending leads to increased production rather than inflation
D: Full employment causes a decrease in overall spending and lowers inflation
E: Prices remain constant at full employment due to government intervention
F: Prices rise only after surpassing full employment due to resource scarcity
G: Prices are unaffected by employment levels and depend solely on monetary policies
H: Full employment guarantees equal distribution of resources across all industries
I: Prices drop when economy approaches full employment
J: There is no price increase when demand increases

Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about the relationship between the price level, full employment, and the impact of additional spending.

The question says: "The price level generally begins to rise before full employment is reached. At full employment, additional spending tends to be purely inflationary." And then there are five options from A to J. My task is to pick the correct answer.

Hmm, I remember that the concept of full employment in the context of economics refers to a situation where all resources are fully utilized. But wait, isn't full employment more about the level of real income that people can be making? Or is it about output? I think full employment in the context of the AD-AS model refers to real GDP being at full employment level, meaning all resources are fully and efficiently employed.

So, the question mentions that the price level "generally begins to rise before full employment is reached." I think that's because if the economy is not at full employment, there's excess capacity. So, if the economy is underutilized, people can save more, leading to higher demand. Higher demand might lead to increased production, which would cause prices to rise. That makes sense.

Now, the second part of the statement says that at full employment, additional spending tends to be purely inflationary. That part is a bit tricky. I recall that in the short run, the economy is at full employment, so people are working at their potential rates. If you try to increase spending beyond the potential level, the economy can't produce more because resources are fully utilized. So any extra spending would just lead to inflation, not more production. That's the idea of the short-run Phillips curve, where output is stuck at full employment, and any extra demand just drives up prices.

Looking at the options:

Option B: "Resources are fully employed simultaneously in all industries." This seems to align with the idea of full employment. If resources are fully employed everywhere, that's at full employment.

Option G: "Prices are unaffected by employment levels and depend solely on monetary policies." That doesn't seem right because if resources are fully employed, then the economy is at full employment, and any extra demand would lead to inflation, not just monetary policies.

Option A: "Prices rise as economy approaches full employment because resources are not fully employed simultaneously in all industries." Wait, if resources aren't fully employed, the economy is underemployment, and that's when prices might rise. But the question is about when the economy is at full employment. So A might describe a situation where prices are rising before full employment, which is correct. But the question's first part says the price level begins to rise before full employment. So A describes the situation before full employment, which is about the cause, not the conclusion.

Wait, the question is about what happens at full employment. So, the correct answer should be about what happens when you're at full employment.

Option C: "At full employment, additional spending leads to increased production rather than inflation." No, that's the opposite. At full employment, you can't increase production because resources are already fully used. So any extra spending would make prices rise, not more production.

Option D: "Full employment causes a decrease in overall spending and lowers inflation." No, that's incorrect. At full employment, spending would still happen, but it would lead to inflation, not a decrease.

Option E: "Prices remain constant at full employment due to government intervention." No, that's not right. Price levels are determined by the economy's structure, not intervention.

Option F: "Prices rise only after surpassing full employment due to resource scarcity." No, that doesn't make sense. The question is about full employment, not about the economy surpassing it.

Option J: "There is no price increase when demand increases." No, that's incorrect because if demand increases and the economy is at full employment, prices would rise, not stay the same.

So, going back, the question is about the behavior at full employment. The correct statement is that at full employment, additional spending causes inflation, not just increases production. So looking for an option that states this.

Option B says resources are fully employed everywhere. That's exactly the definition of full employment. Option C says spending leads to increased production, which is the opposite. So option B is the correct statement about full employment.

Wait, but I thought the question was about what happens at full employment regarding additional spending. The initial part of the question says, "At full employment, additional spending tends to be purely inflationary." So the statement matches with option B, which is part of the question's premise.

So the correct answer is B.

The question discusses the relationship between the price level, full employment, and the impact of additional spending. The correct answer is determined by analyzing each option in the context of full employment.

1. **Option B** ("Resources are fully employed simultaneously in all industries") aligns with the definition of full employment, where all resources are utilized efficiently. This matches the scenario described in the question.

2. **Option C** ("At full employment, additional spending leads to increased production rather than inflation") is incorrect because, at full employment, output is already at its potential level, and additional spending drives inflation, not production.

3. Other options (A, D, E, F, G, H, J) either describe incorrect scenarios, the opposite of what happens at full employment, or involve external factors not relevant to the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as it accurately reflects the concept of full employment.

**ANSWER: B**
