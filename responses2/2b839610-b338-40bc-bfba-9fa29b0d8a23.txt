Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the area between two curves, y equals cos x and y equals cos squared x, from x=0 to x=pi. Hmm, I remember that to find the area between two curves, I need to integrate the top function minus the bottom function over the interval. But first, I need to figure out which function is on top and which is on the bottom between these two points.

Let me think about cos x and cos²x. I know that cos²x can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²x = (1 + cos 2x)/2. But maybe that's not necessary right now. Alternatively, I know that cos x has a maximum of 1, a minimum of -1, and it's positive in the first and fourth quadrants. But since our interval is from 0 to pi, which is the first and second quadrants, cos x is positive there. So in 0 to pi, cos x starts at 1, goes down to -1 at pi. But wait, wait, no—wait, at pi, cos(pi) is -1. Hmm, but wait, wait. Actually, from 0 to pi/2, cos x is positive, and from pi/2 to pi, it's negative. So in the interval 0 to pi, the cos x function starts at 1, goes down to -1 at pi, and cos²x, which is always positive, starts at 1, goes down to 0 at pi/2, and back to 1 at pi.

Wait, so maybe I should sketch the two functions or at least think about their behavior. Let me outline the ranges:

For y = cos x:
- At x=0, cos(0) = 1
- At x=pi/2, cos(pi/2) = 0
- At x=pi, cos(pi) = -1

For y = cos²x:
- y is always non-negative.
- At x=0, cos²(0) = 1
- At x=pi/2, cos²(pi/2) = 0
- At x=pi, cos²(pi) = 1

So, when is cos x greater than cos²x? Let me find where cos x equals cos²x. That would be where cos x = cos²x, which is the same as cos x (1 - cos x) = 0. So this occurs when cos x is 0 or 1.

So when is cos x equal to 1? At x=0 and x=2pi, but within our interval, x=0. So at x=0, both are 1. But wait, what about x=pi? cos(pi) is -1, and cos²(pi) is 1. So at x=pi, cos²x is 1 and cos x is -1.

So between 0 and pi, let's see:

At x=0: both are 1.

What about x=pi/2: cos(pi/2)=0, cos²(pi/2)=0. So they're equal there.

What about x=pi/4: cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707, cos²(pi/4)= (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5. So at pi/4, cos x is larger. So the curve y=cos x is above y=cos²x here.

At x=3pi/4: cos(3pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.707, and cos²(3pi/4)=0.5. So here, cos²x is positive and cos x is negative. So in this region, cos²x is above cos x.

So there's a point where cos x crosses cos²x, which is at x=0 and x=pi/2, as we saw. Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, at x=pi/2, both are zero. So the curves cross at x=0, x=pi/2, and x=pi? Wait, no, at x=pi, cos(pi)= -1 and cos²(pi)=1. So they don't cross there. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps between x=0 and pi, the curves cross only at x=0 and x=pi/2. So between x=0 and pi/2, cos x is above cos²x, and between pi/2 and pi, cos²x is above cos x.

Wait, let me test x=pi/2: both are zero.
x=pi/4: cos x is larger.
x=3pi/4: cos²x is larger.
x=pi: cos x is -1, cos²x is 1.

So, between 0 and pi/2, cos x is above cos²x. Between pi/2 and pi, cos²x is above cos x. So the area is the integral from 0 to pi/2 of (cos x - cos²x) dx, plus the integral from pi/2 to pi of (cos²x - cos x) dx.

But wait, wait, is that correct? Because between pi/2 and pi, cos x is negative, so cos²x is positive. So the top function is cos²x, and the bottom is cos x.

So, the total area A is the integral from 0 to pi/2 of (cos x - cos²x) dx + the integral from pi/2 to pi of (cos²x - cos x) dx.

Alternatively, since cos²x is a positive function, maybe I can find a simpler way to compute the area without splitting the integral. But perhaps I should proceed as is.

So, let's compute each integral.

First integral: from 0 to pi/2 of cos x dx.

The integral of cos x is sin x. Evaluated from 0 to pi/2: sin(pi/2) - sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1.

Second integral: from pi/2 to pi of cos²x dx.

Hmm, cos²x can be integrated using the power-reduction formula: cos²x = (1 + cos 2x)/2. So the integral becomes ∫ (1 + cos 2x)/2 dx from pi/2 to pi.

Which is (1/2) ∫1 dx + (1/2) ∫ cos 2x dx. The first part is (1/2)(x) evaluated from pi/2 to pi, and the second part is (1/2)( (sin 2x)/2 ) evaluated from pi/2 to pi.

So, let's compute each part.

First part: (1/2)(pi - pi/2) = (1/2)(pi/2) = pi/4.

Second part: (1/4) [ sin 2x ] evaluated from pi/2 to pi.

At x=pi: sin 2pi = 0.

At x=pi/2: sin(pi) = 0.

So the difference is 0 - 0 = 0. So the second part is 0.

So the integral from pi/2 to pi is pi/4.

Wait, no, let me double-check. Wait, the integral of cos 2x is (sin 2x)/2. So when evaluated from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: sin(2pi) = 0.

At pi/2: sin(pi) = 0.

So the definite integral is (0 - 0)/2 = 0. So the second integral is (1/2)*0 = 0.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in that step. The integral is (1/2) ∫ cos 2x dx, which is (1/2) * (sin 2x)/2 evaluated between pi/2 and pi.

So that's (1/4)(sin2pi - sin pi) = (1/4)(0 - 0) = 0. So, the second integral is pi/4 (from the first part) + 0 = pi/4.

So the area from pi/2 to pi is pi/4.

Wait, so the total area is the first integral of 1 plus the second integral of pi/4, which is 1 + pi/4.

But wait, hold on. The question is the area between y=cos x and y=cos²x from x=0 to x=pi. So, wait, the way I set up is correct, because from 0 to pi/2, cos x is above, so we subtract cos²x from cos x, and from pi/2 to pi, we subtract cos x from cos²x. So the area would be the sum of these two integrals.

So, from 0 to pi/2, the integral is 1, and from pi/2 to pi, it's pi/4. So total area is 1 + (pi/4). Wait, but pi is approximately 3.14, so pi/4 is about 0.785. So 1 + 0.785 is about 1.785. Hmm, but looking at the options:

Options are A:3.5, B:1, C:0.25, D:0.5, E:2.5, F:1.5, G:1.75, H:2.75, I:3, J:2.

Wait, 1.785 is close to 1.75. So perhaps the exact value is (1 + pi/4). Wait, but wait, when I did the integrals, I think I might have miscalculated.

Wait, let me double-check the second integral from pi/2 to pi.

Integral of cos²x is pi/4. But I thought the first integral was 1, so 1 + pi/4 is approximately 1.785. But one of the options is 1.75, which is G. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the area can be found more cleverly without splitting the integral.

Alternatively, since the curves cross at x=0, x=pi/2, and x=pi, but wait, at x=pi, cos x is -1 and cos²x is 1. So they don't cross there.

Wait, but wait, perhaps we can find the area in a different way. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the area can be calculated by integrating from 0 to pi, but considering that the upper and lower functions change. So as I did before, from 0 to pi/2, cos x is above cos²x, and from pi/2 to pi, cos²x is above cos x.

So the area is integral from 0 to pi/2 of (cos x - cos²x) dx plus integral from pi/2 to pi of (cos²x - cos x) dx.

So let's compute the first integral:

Integral of cos x from 0 to pi/2 is [sin x] from 0 to pi/2 = 1 - 0 =1.

Integral of cos²x from 0 to pi/2 is (pi/4) as I calculated before.

So the first part is 1 - (pi/4).

But wait, wait, no. Wait, the first integral is (cos x - cos²x) dx, so it's integral of cos x minus integral of cos²x.

So, 1 minus (pi/4) for the first part. Wait no, the second integral over 0 to pi/2 is (pi/4), as I had.

So, the first part (0 to pi/2) is Integral(cos x) dx minus Integral(cos²x) dx: 1 - (pi/4).

The second part (pi/2 to pi) is Integral(cos²x) dx minus Integral(cos x) dx: (pi/4) -1.

So adding these two parts: [1 - (pi/4)] + [ (pi/4) -1 ] = 1 - pi/4 + pi/4 -1 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. That would imply zero, which can't be correct.

Wait, that can't be. Oh, I think I made a mistake in the second integral. Wait, no—wait, the integral from pi/2 to pi of cos²x dx is pi/4, as I found earlier. The integral from pi/2 to pi of cos x dx is [sin x] from pi/2 to pi: sin(pi) - sin(pi/2) = 0 -1 = -1. So the integral from pi/2 to pi of cos x dx is -1.

So the second part is (pi/4) - ( -1 ) = pi/4 +1.

So now, the total area is [1 - (pi/4)] + [pi/4 +1] = 1 - pi/4 + pi/4 +1 = 2.

Wait, that makes sense? Because adding the two parts, the pi/4 terms cancel out, and we're left with 1 +1 = 2. So the total area is 2.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Let me re-express it.

The area is the integral from 0 to pi/2 of (cos x - cos²x) dx plus the integral from pi/2 to pi of (cos²x - cos x) dx.

Compute first integral:

Integral cos x dx from 0 to pi/2 = 1.

Integral cos²x dx from 0 to pi/2: (pi/4).

So first part is (1) - (pi/4).

Second integral:

Integral cos²x dx from pi/2 to pi: as we found, (pi/4).

Integral cos x dx from pi/2 to pi: [sin x] from pi/2 to pi, which is 0 -1 = -1.

So second part is (pi/4) - (-1) = pi/4 +1.

So total area is first part plus second part: (1 - pi/4) + (pi/4 +1) = 2.

So the area is exactly 2. So looking at the options, J is 2.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the area was 1 + pi/4, but that was incorrect because I considered the integrals without considering the sign correctly. So in fact, the correct area is 2.

So the correct answer is J:2.

I should double-check this. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the integral for the entire interval from 0 to pi, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find another approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps use symmetry. Since from 0 to pi, the area is symmetric in some way. But given that cos x is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi], and cos²x is always positive.

Alternatively, consider that the function cos²x can be rewritten as (1 + cos 2x)/2, so integrating from 0 to pi would give (pi/2) + (sin 2x)/4 evaluated from 0 to pi, which would give (pi/2) + 0, since sin 2pi is 0 and sin 0 is 0. So that's pi/2.

But that's the integral of cos²x from 0 to pi. But our area is different because we are subtracting cos²x from cos x in some parts.

Wait, but the area between two curves is the integral of the top minus the bottom. So, from 0 to pi/2, cos x is above cos²x, so the area there is the integral of (cos x - cos²x) dx. From pi/2 to pi, cos²x is above cos x, so the area is the integral of (cos²x - cos x) dx.

Which, as I computed before, gives 2.

So the correct answer is 2, which is option J.

The area between the curves $y = \cos x$ and $y = \cos^2 x$ from $x = 0$ to $x = \pi$ is found by integrating the top function minus the bottom function over the interval. 

- From $x = 0$ to $x = \pi/2$, $\cos x$ is above $\cos^2 x$, so the integral is $\int_0^{\pi/2} (\cos x - \cos^2 x) \, dx$.
- From $x = \pi/2$ to $x = \pi$, $\cos^2 x$ is above $\cos x$, so the integral is $\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} (\cos^2 x - \cos x) \, dx$.

Calculating these integrals:
1. $\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos x \, dx = \sin x \Big|_0^{\pi/2} = 1$.
2. $\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^2 x \, dx$ uses the power-reduction formula, yielding $\pi/4$.
3. $\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \cos^2 x \, dx = \pi/4$.
4. $\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \cos x \, dx = \sin x \Big|_{\pi/2}^{\pi} = -1$.

Adding the areas:
- First part: $1 - \pi/4$.
- Second part: $\pi/4 - (-1) = \pi/4 + 1$.

Total area = $(1 - \pi/4) + (\pi/4 + 1) = 2$.
