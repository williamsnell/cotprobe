Question:

A defendant was arrested at an airport when the small suitcase he was carrying was found to contain heroin. The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial. Moreover, the defendant testified that although he was a former heroin addict, he had not used any heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is

Options:

A: permissible, because the defendant's past addiction could provide context for the possession charge.
B: permissible, because the defendant's physical condition is a matter of public record.
C: objectionable, because it is an invasion of the defendant's personal privacy.
D: objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.
E: objectionable, because the defendant's past addiction is protected health information.
F: objectionable, because the defendant's past addiction is not relevant to the current charges.
G: permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.
H: permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.
I: objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
J: permissible, because the defendant's past addiction could imply a motivation for possession.

Okay, so I've got this law question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about evidence law, specifically about the constitutionality of evidence presented during a trial.

So, the scenario: A defendant was arrested at an airport, and he was carrying a suitcase with heroin. He didn't challenge the legality of the search. Then, he was prosecuted for possession. He testified that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was with him when he was arrested. The girlfriend died from a skydiving accident two weeks before the trial. Also, he testified that he was a former addict but hadn't used heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked him to roll up his shirt and show his arms to inspect needle marks. The question is whether this is permissible.

The options are A to J, each offering a different reason why the evidence is or isn't allowed.

Let me break this down. The first point is about the defendant's past addiction. He said he had a history, but it's not clear if that's relevant. The second is about the girlfriend's death, which is probably a relevant event for the probative value.

The key issue here is whether showing his arms would be seen as an invasion of privacy. The defendant is a minor, so he's a minor, and his arms could be considered private property. However, I'm not entirely sure about the law on this. 

Wait, I remember that evidence like this usually involves personal privacy. The defendant's arms are a private matter, so showing them might be intrusive. But sometimes, in cases of self-incrimination, like when a minor is shown against the stand to prove guilt, the court may have to consider whether the evidence is permissible.

But in this case, the defendant is being cross-examined, so perhaps the primary issue is about whether his arms' condition is a public matter. The girlfriend's death is a serious matter and would be protected by public records. So, the cross-examination's purpose is to assess the probative value of the evidence presented.

So, the cross-examination is about whether the defendant is telling the truth about his past addiction. The question is whether showing his arms is permissible. 

In many cases, showing private property is not allowed unless the evidence is specifically deemed protected by law. For example, if the defendant is a minor, his arms can't be shown against the stand unless the case law permits it.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's objectionable because it's an invasion of personal privacy. That makes sense because showing your arms is private. Option B talks about public records, but the question is about the reason for the objection.

Option A says it's permissible because of past addiction. But the person's arms are private, and showing them is generally not allowed unless it's for self-incrimination. But in this case, it's because the defendant is being cross-examined, not because of a genuine self-incrimination.

Option E suggests that the past addiction is protected health information. I'm not sure about that. Health information can sometimes be relevant, but I think in this context, the focus is more on privacy and personal property.

Option G says it's permissible because the evidence is relevant to credibility. But I'm not sure that's the issue here; the issue is whether it's within the bounds of privacy.

Option I says it's because past addiction isn't relevant to current charges. But the arms' condition is more about personal privacy, not the past possession.

Option J says it's permissible because the past addiction implies motivation. That seems less likely, as the evidence itself isn't about intent but about the physical condition.

So, the main issue is about whether showing the arms is an invasion of privacy. The defendant's privacy rights are protected because his arms are private property. Therefore, the cross-examination's purpose is to show that the arms are in good condition, but showing them could infringe on his privacy.

So, looking at the options, option C is about it being an invasion of personal privacy. Option B is about public records. But the reason here is about privacy, not the reason for the cross-examination's purpose.

Wait, but option C says it's an invasion, so that's the reason. Option B is about the reason for the evidence's probative value, but the question is about the reason for the cross-examination.

So, the question is about the cross-examination's reason. The cross-examination is about whether the defendant's arms were in good condition. The reason for that is about showing the arms to reveal his private property. So, the cross-examination is probably an attempt to show his arms. If that's permissible, then the cross-examination is allowed.

However, the question is whether the request is permissible. The statute on this, like the Fourth Amendment, states that the right to privacy is protected. The defendant's personal property, like his arms, should be protected. So, showing them could be considered an invasion of privacy.

So, the cross-examination's request is against his privacy. Therefore, the right is against self-incrimination. But since it's about showing his arms, which is personal, it's an invasion.

Wait, but in some cases, when a minor is shown against the stand, the court may have to decide whether it's permissible. For example, if a minor is shown against the stand to prove guilt, the court may have the discretion to allow it unless the case law forbids it.

In this situation, the cross-examination is about whether his arms' condition is relevant. So, the defendant is being shown his arms to show if they're in good condition. That's a private matter, so he can't show them against the stand unless it's for self-incrimination.

But the question is about the reason for the cross-examination. The reason is about showing his arms, which is private. So, the defense would say it's an invasion of personal privacy. The prosecution would argue it's not.

But the question is about the cross-examination's reason. So, the answer is C: it's an invasion of the defendant's personal privacy.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The cross-examination's primary purpose is to show that the arms are in good condition. The reason for that is showing his arms, which is personal property. So, the reason for the cross-examination is about showing his arms, which is a violation of privacy. So, the court would say the evidence is not permissible because it's an invasion of the person's privacy.

So, the correct answer would be option C: it's an invasion of the defendant's personal privacy.

The question revolves around the permissible nature of a cross-examination request where the defendant is shown his arms to assess the condition of his private property. The key issue is whether showing his arms constitutes an invasion of the defendant's personal privacy. 

The defendant is a minor, and his arms are considered private property. Evidence involving private property, such as showing one's arms, is typically not permissible unless the case law explicitly allows it. In this case, the request to show the defendant's arms is an invasion of the defendant's personal privacy, as it involves private property. 

Thus, the correct answer is that this request is permissible because it is an invasion of the defendant's personal privacy.

Answer: C
