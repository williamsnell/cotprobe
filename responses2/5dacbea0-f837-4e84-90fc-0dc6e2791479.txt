Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. So, the question is about vapor pressure lowering when a solute is added to a solvent. I remember that this has something to do with the concept of colligative properties, right? Colligative properties depend on the number of solute particles, not the type.

The problem states that water at 30°C has a vapor pressure of 31.82 mm Hg. Then, when 25.0 grams of ethylene glycol is added to 1000 grams of water, the vapor pressure drops to 31.59 mm Hg. We need to find the molecular weight of ethylene glycol.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this is a Raoult's Law problem. Raoult's Law says that the vapor pressure of the solution (P) is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent (X_solvent) multiplied by the vapor pressure of the pure solvent (P°). The formula is P = X_solvent * P°.

Wait, wait. The problem says the vapor pressure is lowered, which makes sense because the solute (ethylene glycol) is volatile and dissolves in water, lowering the vapor pressure of pure water. So, the solution's vapor pressure is lower than the pure solvent's.

So, the initial vapor pressure of pure water is 31.82 mm Hg. After adding ethylene glycol, it's 31.59 mm Hg. The difference is 0.23 mm Hg. Or wait, more accurately, the decrease is 31.82 - 31.59 = 0.23 mm Hg. So that's the decrease in vapor pressure.

But how does that relate to the mole fraction of water? Because P = X_water * P_water^0. So, X_water = P_solution / P_water^0. Wait, no. Wait, P_solution = X_water * P_water^0. So, X_water = P_solution / P_water^0. Because P_solution = X_water * P_water^0.

Wait, but the problem is about the mole fraction of the solvent, right? Because we're adding a solute. So, in this case, the solvent is water, and the solute is ethylene glycol.

So, the mole fraction of water in the solution is (moles of water)/(total moles of water + moles of ethylene glycol).

But wait, since P_solution = X_water * P_water^0, then X_water = P_solution / P_water^0.

So, the solution's vapor pressure is 31.59 mm Hg. So, X_water = (31.59 mm Hg) / (31.82 mm Hg) = approximately 0.9933.

So, X_water = 0.9933.

But let's compute that more accurately. 31.59 divided by 31.82.

Let me do that division. 31.59 / 31.82 ≈ 0.9933.

Okay, so X_water is about 0.9933.

But X_water is also equal to (moles of water) / (moles of water + moles of ethylene glycol).

So, let me denote n_water as the moles of water, and n_ethylene as moles of ethylene glycol.

We have n_water / (n_water + n_ethylene) = 0.9933.

We can rewrite this as n_water ≈ 0.9933 * (n_water + n_ethylene).

Expanding that, n_water ≈ 0.9933 n_water + 0.9933 n_ethylene.

Subtracting 0.9933 n_water from both sides:

n_water - 0.9933 n_water ≈ 0.9933 n_ethylene.

Which gives 0.0067 n_water ≈ 0.9933 n_ethylene.

So, n_ethylene ≈ (0.0067 / 0.9933) * n_water.

Calculating that ratio: 0.0067 / 0.9933 ≈ 0.00674.

So, n_ethylene ≈ 0.00674 * n_water.

So, n_ethylene is approximately 0.00674 times the moles of water.

Now, we can calculate the moles of water. Since the mass of water is 1000 grams, and its molar mass is about 18.015 g/mol, the moles of water are 1000 / 18.015 ≈ 55.51 mol.

So, n_water ≈ 55.51 mol.

Then, n_ethylene = 0.00674 * 55.51 ≈ let's compute that.

0.00674 * 55.51 → 55.51 * 0.00674.

Calculating step by step: 55.51 * 0.006 is 0.33306, 55.51 * 0.00074 is about 0.0408. So, adding them: 0.33306 + 0.0408 ≈ 0.37386.

So, n_ethylene is approximately 0.37386 moles.

Now, the mass of ethylene glycol added is 25.0 grams. Let's denote its molar mass as M.

So, n = mass / molar mass → 0.37386 = 25.0 / M → M = 25.0 / 0.37386.

Let me compute that. 25 / 0.37386 ≈ let's see.

25 divided by 0.37386. Well, 0.37386 is approximately 0.374, so 25 / 0.374 → approximately 67.04.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

0.37386 * 67 = let's see. 0.37386 * 60 = 22.4316; 0.37386 *7= 2.61702. Total 22.4316+2.61702=25.04862. Oh, wait, that's 67.000 times 0.37386 is 25.04862, which is a little over 25.

Wait, but we have 0.37386 times 67.04 would that be, or perhaps 67.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 0.37386 *67 is 25.04862. So, 25.04862 is more than 25. So, if 0.37386 *67 ≈25.0486, then 0.37386 *67 = 25.0486, which is a little more than 25. So, 25.0486 is 67.

Wait, but our n is 0.37386 = 25.0 / M → M =25.0 / 0.37386 ≈ let me compute 25.0 / 0.37386.

Ah, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me do 25.0 divided by 0.37386.

So, 25.0 / 0.37386 ≈ 66.778.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let me think:

0.37386 * 67 = 25.04862 → that's a bit more than 25. So, 0.37386 * 67 = 25.04862.

We have n = 0.37386 = 25.0 / M.

So, 25.0 = M * 0.37386 → M = 25.0 / 0.37386 → approximately 66.778 g/mol.

So, looking at the options, let's see which one is near 66.778.

The options are:

A:62, B:70, C:74, D:58, E:56, F:60, G:72, H:68, I:64, J:66.

So, 66 is option J.

So the molecular weight of ethylene glycol is approximately 67, which is option J:66.

Wait, but wait, let's make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

1. Vapor pressure change: 31.82 -31.59 =0.23 mmHg.

2. X_water = P_solution / P_water^0 =31.59 /31.82 ≈ 0.9933.

3. X_water = n_water / (n_water + n_ethylene) → 0.9933 = n_water / (n_water + n_ethylene).

4. So, n_ethylene = (0.0067 / 0.9933) * n_water → approx 0.0067 * n_water.

5. n_water = 1000 g /18.015 g/mol → approx 55.51 mol.

6. n_ethylene = 0.0067 * 55.51 ≈0.37386 mol.

7. Moles = mass / molar mass → 0.37386 = 25.0 / M → M =25.0 /0.37386 ≈66.778 → approx 67.

Looking back at the options, J is 66, which is the closest. The others are 62 (A), 66 (J), 70 (B), 72 (G), etc. So, 66 is the correct answer.

To determine the molecular weight of ethylene glycol, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the vapor pressure of a solution is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent multiplied by the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. The problem involves a decrease in vapor pressure of the solution compared to the pure solvent, which corresponds to the solute (ethylene glycol) lowering the vapor pressure.

### Step 1: Vapor Pressure Difference
The initial vapor pressure of water is 31.82 mmHg, and after adding ethylene glycol, the vapor pressure decreases to 31.59 mmHg. The decrease in vapor pressure is:

\[
\Delta P = 31.82 - 31.59 = 0.23 \, \text{mmHg}.
\]

### Step 2: Mole Fraction of Water
The mole fraction of water in the solution is given by:

\[
X_{\text{water}} = \frac{P_{\text{solution}}}{P_{\text{water}}^\circ} = \frac{31.59}{31.82}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
X_{\text{water}} \approx 0.9933.
\]

### Step 3: Relationship Between Mole Fractions
The mole fraction of water is also expressed as:

\[
X_{\text{water}} = \frac{n_{\text{water}}}{n_{\text{water}} + n_{\text{ethylene}}}.
\]

Rearranging for \(n_{\text{ethylene}}\):

\[
n_{\text{ethylene}} = n_{\text{water}} \left(1 - X_{\text{water}}\right).
\]

Substituting \(X_{\text{water}} = 0.9933\):

\[
n_{\text{ethylene}} = n_{\text{water}} \left(1 - 0.9933\right) = n_{\text{water}} \cdot 0.0067.
\]

### Step 4: Moles of Water
The mass of water is 1000 g, and its molar mass is approximately 18.015 g/mol. Thus:

\[
n_{\text{water}} = \frac{1000}{18.015} \approx 55.51 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 5: Moles of Ethylene Glycol
Using the relationship for \(n_{\text{ethylene}}\):

\[
n_{\text{ethylene}} = 0.0067 \cdot 55.51 \approx 0.37386 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 6: Molecular Weight of Ethylene Glycol
The mass of ethylene glycol is 25.0 g. The molar mass \(M\) is calculated as:

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{moles}} = \frac{25.0}{0.37386} \approx 66.778 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 7: Matching with Options
The calculated molecular weight of ethylene glycol is approximately 66.778 g/mol. Among the given options, the closest value is **66**.
