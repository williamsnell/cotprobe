Okay, so I have this question here about the unit cost of lemons. Let me read it again. The grocerystore sells a bag of 5 lemons for $2.00. The question is asking for the unit cost per lemon. Hmm, unit cost means the cost per one unit, so in this case, per lemon.

Alright, let me think about how to calculate that. If a bag has 5 lemons and costs $2.00, I need to divide the total cost by the number of lemons to find the cost per lemon. So that's $2.00 divided by 5 lemons.

Let me do the math. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So each lemon costs 40 cents. Let me check the options provided. Option C is $0.40, which matches what I calculated. 

Wait, but another way to think about it is if each lemon was $0.40, then 5 times $0.40 would be $2.00. Yeah, that makes sense. So the unit cost per lemon is indeed 40 cents. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculation seems straightforward.

The unit cost per lemon is calculated by dividing the total cost by the number of lemons. 

$2.00 รท 5 = $0.40 per lemon.
