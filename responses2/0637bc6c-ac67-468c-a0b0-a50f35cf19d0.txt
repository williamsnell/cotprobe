Question:

A 76-year-old man comes to the office because of early awakening at night. He has no difficulty falling asleep but routinely wakes up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. The patient is a retired postal worker, and he has always been physically active. He has diabetes mellitus controlled by diet. The patient drinks one cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast and usually walks for exercise in the morning. Before retiring at night he has one alcoholic beverage.

Vital signs are temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 96/min and regular, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a well-nourished, well-developed man. He is not obese. Examination of the head and neck is normal; there are no bruits or jugular venous distention. Chest is clear, and heart is normal with S1 and S2. Abdomen is soft and nontender with active bowel sounds and no organomegaly. Rectal examination discloses no abnormalities.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the best management for this patient with insomnia. Let me read through the details carefully.

So, the patient is a 76-year-old man with no difficulty falling asleep. He usually wakes between 2 and 3 AM. He's 退休的邮差，一直很Physical activity is his main way to stay awake— he drinks a coffee in the morning with breakfast, walks in the morning, and before retiring, he has one alcoholic beverage. He's got diabetes under a controlled diet, and no over-the-counter meds. His wife is healthy too.

His vital signs are normal: 37.1°C (98.8°F), 96 bpm, 18 respirations, and 135/90 mmHg BP. Physical exam shows a healthy person, no issues like weight, etc. Abdomen is soft, active bowel sounds, no organomegaly.

The options are about management. Let's look at each.

A: Watch TV — probably not, since TV can disrupt sleep. Also, may not help if he's already awake.

B: Sleep pills — maybe, but not sure if he's overactive. He's 76, often awake, so maybe not.

C: Read and snack in bed. That could help relax the body and reduce snoring or other sleep issues. Maybe.

D: Daytime nap — would that compensate for lost sleep? I'm not sure. He's already awake, though.

E: Exercise — if he's overactive, exercise might help. But if he's already active, maybe not needed.

F: Sertraline — I think sertraline is for sleep disorders like insomnia, but is it the first choice?

G: Low-carb diet — not sure if the patient needs that, especially with diabetes. Maybe not relevant.

H: Discontinue alcohol — he had one before retiring. Maybe that was the issue, but the question is about insomnia, not alcohol.

I: Caffeine — he's already got diabetes and no overmedications. Maybe not necessary.

J: Caffeine intake — probably not needed, as he's already at a healthy BP.

So the options are C, B, and F.

Now, what's the best approach for someone with sleep apnea? I think in this case, the patient might have sleep apnea. Because he's a retired person, active, and drinks alcohol in the morning. Maybe he has apnea.

If he has apnea, which is common in older adults, especially with diabetes and lack of sleep, the best management might be to take an anti-apneatic drug like sertraline, which is option F.

Alternatively, sometimes snacking before bed can help relax the body, which is option C.

But sertraline is a quicker, more effective treatment for sleep apnea. So if the patient has apnea, F would be better.

But wait, the patient is 76, so sleep apnea is a possibility. He's not obese, but he's active, so maybe it's a mild form.

In the absence of sleep apnea, options B or C might apply. But if it's a known condition like sleep apnea, sertraline is the go-to.

So the most appropriate is option F.
</think>

The patient presents with sleep apnea, likely due to the combination of his inactive lifestyle (drinking alcohol, lack of sleep) and his 76-year-old age. His absence of sleep apnea is supported by his physical examination and medical history. The most appropriate management for sleep apnea is to use sertraline, which is option F. 

Answer: F
