Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about measuring the wavelength of lines in atomic emission and absorption spectra using a spectroscope. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy of an electronic transition in sodium metal. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, right?

Wait, wait. Let me think. Oh yeah, the formula is E = (hc) / λ. But wait, I think sometimes people use different units. Oh right, because in the question, the wavelength is given in angstroms. Oh wait, I remember that 1 angstrom is 10^-10 meters. So, 1 Å is 1e-10 m.

The problem says one of the lines has a wavelength of 5890 Å. So I need to convert that into meters. Let's see, 5890 Å is 5890 times 1e-10 meters. So that's 5.89e-7 meters.

Wait, but the formula uses h in ergs and c in cm/s? Or wait, h is given here as 6.62 × 10^-27 erg-sec. Oh, I think the standard formula uses h in ergs, c in cm/s, and λ in cm, so that E is in ergs. But wait, let me get the units straight.

So the given wavelength is 5890 Å. Let's convert that to cm because c is in cm/s. Since 1 Å is 1e-8 cm (because 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1e-10 m is 1e-8 cm). So 5890 Å is 5890e-8 cm. That's 5.89e-5 cm.

So now, plug into E = hc/λ. So h is 6.62e-27 erg s, c is 3e10 cm/s.

So E = (6.62e-27 erg s) * (3e10 cm/s) / (5.89e-5 cm).

Let me compute that step by step. Multiply h and c first: 6.62e-27 *3e10 = 1.986e-16 erg cm/s. Wait, wait no, because the units in h are erg s and c is cm/s, so when you multiply h by c, the s and cm/s cancel, leaving erg cm. So hc is 6.62e-27 * 3e10 = about 1.986e-16 erg cm.

Then, divide by λ which is in cm. So 1.986e-16 erg cm / 5.89e-5 cm. The cm cancels, so we have 1.986e-16 / 5.89e-5 erg.

Let me compute 1.986 / 5.89. Let me see, 5.89 times 0.337 is approximately 2.0 (because 5.89 *0.3 = 1.767, 5.89 *0.03=0.1767, 5.89*0.007=0.04123. So 0.3 + 0.03 is 0.33, 0.33*5.89 = 1.9437; 0.007*5.89=0.04123. Total 1.9437+0.0412=1.9849. So 0.337 would give around 1.986. So 1.986 /5.89 is approximately 0.337.

So 0.337e-16 / 1e-5 = 0.337e-11 erg. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the exponents: 1e-16 divided by 1e-5 is 1e-11. So 0.337e-11 erg. So that's 3.37e-12 erg.

Wait, let me check the math again. 1.986e-16 divided by 5.89e-5 is (1.986 /5.89) * 1e(-16+5) → (0.337) * 1e-11 → 3.37e-12 erg. So approximately 3.37e-12 erg.

Looking at the options, option F is 3.37e-12 erg, which would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I did all the steps correctly. Oh, wait, wait. I think I might have messed up the exponents somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, 1e-16 divided by 1e-5 is 1e(-16 +5) = 1e-11. So 1.986e-16 /5.89e-5 = (1.986/5.89) * 1e-11. 1.986/5.89 is approximately 0.3369. So 0.3369e-11 = 3.369e-12 erg, which is about 3.37e-12 erg. So yes, that would be option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 3.37 × 10^-12 erg. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the energy of the electronic transition associated with the sodium-D lines, we use the formula for the energy of a photon:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Here, \( h = 6.62 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg·s} \) is Planck's constant, \( c = 3.0 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 5890 \, \text{Å} \) is the wavelength of the line. 

### Step 1: Convert Wavelength to Centimeters
The wavelength is given in Angstroms (\(\text{Å}\)), and \( 1 \, \text{Å} = 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \). Thus:

\[
\lambda = 5890 \, \text{Å} = 5890 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} = 5.89 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Energy
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
E = \frac{(6.62 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg·s})(3.0 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s})}{5.89 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}}
\]

First, calculate \( h \cdot c \):

\[
h \cdot c = (6.62 \times 10^{-27})(3.0 \times 10^{10}) = 1.986 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{erg·cm}
\]

Now, divide by \( \lambda \):

\[
E = \frac{1.986 \times 10^{-16}}{5.89 \times 10^{-5}} = (1.986 / 5.89) \times 10^{-11} \, \text{erg}
\]

The ratio \( 1.986 / 5.89 \approx 0.337 \), so:

\[
E \approx 0.337 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{erg} = 3.37 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg}
\]

### Step 3: Match the Result to the Options
The calculated energy \( 3.37 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg} \) corresponds to option **F**.
