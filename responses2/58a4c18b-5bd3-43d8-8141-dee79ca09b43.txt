C: I and II.
D: I and III.
E: I, II, and III.
F: I only.
G: II only.
H: I and III, with the addition of IV. MR = P = demand on downward sloping function for monopoly.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about perfect competition, monopoly, and imperfect competition. The question is about why under perfect competition, price equals marginal revenue (MR), but under imperfect (monopoly or other) situations, P is greater than MR. Hmm, I need to figure out which statements (I, II, III) are correct and then match them with the options given.

Let me think about each part step by step.

First, what's the difference between perfect competition and other market structures?

Perfect competition has a few characteristics: many sellers, homogeneous products, free entry and exit, and perfect information. Monopoly has only one seller, so the market is entirely concentrated, and there's no entry or exit possibilities. Monopoly is the opposite of perfect competition because it's the only provider.

Now, about price and MR. In perfect competition, each seller is a price taker. They can't set their own price because all others are similar. So the demand curve for an individual firm is perfectly elastic, meaning it's horizontal. For the industry as a whole, the demand curve is also horizontal, which is the market demand curve for all firms.

Under perfect competition, MR equals price because each additional unit you sell gives you a price benefit. So MR = P. Also, since the demand is horizontal, price is the same everywhere, so P equals the demand at the quantity sold.

Wait, but how does this relate to MR? So for each firm, MR is the same as P because each additional unit sold adds the same price. So yes, under perfect competition, MR = P.

But in other market structures like monopoly or imperfect competition, the situation is different. In a monopoly, there's only one seller, so the monopolist can set a price above marginal cost. Because the firm is the sole provider, the demand curve it faces is the entire market demand, which is downward sloping. So for the monopolist, MR is less than P because each additional unit sold requires reducing price from the current level, hence MR is lower than P.

Wait, but in the case of perfect competition, the MR is equal to the price because the firm's demand curve is horizontal. So for perfect competition:

I. MR = P = demand. Because it's a horizontal demand, MR is always equal to price. So I think statement I is about perfect competition. So statement I is correct.

But statement II says P > MR in imperfect (monopoly) or imperfect competition. I think that's correct because in imperfect markets, MR is less than P. So II is correct.

Statement III: In imperfect competition, demand and price are represented as a vertical function. Wait, no. In perfect competition, demand is horizontal, not vertical. So statement III in the question is incorrect. Because in perfect competition, demand is horizontal (as part of the horizontal demand curve), not vertical.

So looking at the options, I need to see which statements are correct.

The question is asking which combination of statements correctly illustrates the points. Let me rephrase.

The question is: which of the following correctly illustrates why P=MR in perfect competition and P>MR in imperfect. The statements I, II, III are part of the possible correct combinations.

So for each part (perfect comp, imperfect comp), which statements are correct.

Under perfect competition:

I. MR=P=horizontal demand. So I is correct.

II. Does it say P>MR? No, it's about price being greater than MR. But in perfect comp, P equals MR because MR=P. So statement II is not correct for perfect comp.

Wait, but the question is about why in perfect comp, P=MR, and in imperfect, P>MR. So statement I is correct for perfect comp, but II is about imperfect comp, which is correct because P>MR. But wait, in perfect comp, MR=P, so why is it that P>MR? Because in perfect comp, P = MR. So statement II is incorrect for perfect comp, but correct for imperfect.

So what about the statements in the options. The question says, which of the following correctly illustrates why P = MR under perfect comp, and P>MR under imperfect?

So each of the I, II, III in the options refers to a specific statement. The correct statements are:

Under perfect comp:

I. True. Because MR=P and demand is horizontal.

Under imperfect comp:

II. True. Because P>MR.

III: In imperfect comp, demand is a vertical function. So III is incorrect because in perfect comp, it's horizontal.

So the correct statements are I and II. So looking at the options, which option includes I and II?

Looking at the options:

Option D: I and III. Hmm, that's I and III. But III is incorrect because in perfect comp, demand is horizontal, not vertical.

Option D is I and III, but III is wrong.

Option C: I and II. That's correct because I is correct, II is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which combination correctly illustrates the correct points. So for perfect comp, I is correct. And for imperfect, II is correct.

Therefore, the correct statements are I and II. So the correct option is C: I and II.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at each option:

A: II and III. So II is correct, III is incorrect.

B: I, II, III. But III is wrong.

C: I and II.

D: I and III.

E: I, II, and III.

So option C is I and II.

But wait, the initial question is about why P=MR under perfect comp, and P>MR under imperfect. So for perfect comp, I is correct (MR=P, because demand is horizontal). For imperfect comp, II is correct (P>MR). But statement III is about demand being vertical in imperfect, which is incorrect.

So the correct statements are I and II. So option C is correct.

To address the question, we analyze the relationships between price (P), marginal revenue (MR), and market structures:

1. **Perfect Competition**:  
   - Demand is horizontal because each firm is a price taker.  
   - Marginal revenue (MR) equals price (P) because each additional unit sold does not affect the price.  
   - Therefore, **I (MR = P = demand)** is correct.  
   - Statement II (P > MR) is incorrect because in perfect competition, P = MR.

2. **Monopoly or Imperfect Competition**:  
   - Demand is downward sloping because there is only one seller.  
   - Marginal revenue (MR) is less than price (P) because to sell more, the firm must lower the price.  
   - Therefore, **II (P > MR)** is correct.  
   - Statement III (Demand is vertical) is incorrect because in perfect competition, demand is horizontal, not vertical.

3. **Incorrect Statements**:  
   - Statement III (Demand is vertical) is incorrect for perfect competition.  
   - Statement IV is not relevant to the question.

4. **Correct Combinations**:  
   - Option **D (I and III)** is incorrect because III is false.  
   - Option **E (I, II, III)** is incorrect because III is false.  
   - Option **C (I and II)** is correct because both statements are true.  
   - Option **B (I, II, III)** is incorrect because III is false.  
   - Option **F (I only)** is incorrect because II is false.

Thus, the correct answer is **C (I and II)**, as they accurately illustrate the required relationships.

**ANSWER: C**
