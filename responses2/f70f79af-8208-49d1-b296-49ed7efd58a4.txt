Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation. Hmm, let's see. Tom bought a bike for $80, and after 4 years, he sold it for $15. They want to find the annual depreciation using the straight line method and also the rate of depreciation. 

Right, straight line depreciation is a method where the value decreases evenly over the useful life of the asset. So, I remember the formula for annual depreciation is (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life. Oh wait, but the useful life isn't given here. Oh wait wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again. Oh, the question doesn't specify the useful life. Hmm, this is confusing. Did I miss that part?

Wait, no, the question might have a typo or perhaps the useful life is implied. Oh wait, maybe it's not, and perhaps the depreciation isn't calculated over 4 years, but the question might have a trick. Alternatively, perhaps the question is missing something, but let's think. 

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the useful life is four years, given that it's used for 4 years. So the straight line annual depreciation is (80 -15)/4. Let me compute that. 80 minus 15 is 65. 65 divided by 4 is 16.25. So the annual depreciation would be $16.25 per year.

So looking at the options, option B says $16.25 per year and 20.3%. Option D is $19 and 23.75, C is $17 and 21.25, etc. But wait, the rate of depreciation is another calculation. Oh right, the annual rate is the depreciation rate. So the rate is (16.25 /80) *100%. Let me calculate that: 16.25 /80 is 0.203125, so 20.3125%, which is approximately 20.3%, so option B says 20.3%, so that's correct.

But wait, the question is asking for both the annual depreciation and the annual rate. So the depreciation is $16.25 per year, option B has $16.25 as the first part. The rate is 20.3%, so the correct answer should be option B: $16.25 per year and 20.3%.

To determine the annual depreciation and rate of depreciation using the straight line method:

1. **Depreciation Calculation**:
   - Cost = $80
   - Salvage Value = $15
   - Useful Life = 4 years
   - Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life = (80 - 15) / 4 = $16.25 per year.

2. **Depreciation Rate Calculation**:
   - Annual Depreciation = $16.25
   - Initial Cost = $80
   - Depreciation Rate = (Annual Depreciation / Initial Cost) * 100% = (16.25 / 80) * 100% ≈ 20.3125% ≈ 20.3%.

Thus, the correct answer combines $16.25 annual depreciation and a depreciation rate of 20.3%.
