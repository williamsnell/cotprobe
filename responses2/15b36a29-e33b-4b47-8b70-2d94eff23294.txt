Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a saturated solution of Ca(OH)₂. Hmm, let's see. I remember that Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte, so it should dissociate completely in water. But wait, I'm a bit confused about how to approach this.

The problem says that 5.0 × 10^-4 moles of Ca(OH)₂ are added to 100 mL of solution. Oh right, I should probably find the concentration first. Since it's 100 mL, that's 0.1 liters. So the concentration, M, is moles divided by liters. So 5e-4 / 0.1 equals 5e-3 M. So the concentration is 0.005 M.

But wait, Ca(OH)₂ dissociates into Ca²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. Right, the formula is Ca(OH)₂ → Ca²+ + 2 OH⁻. So each mole of Ca(OH)₂ gives one mole of Ca²+ and two moles of OH⁻. So the concentration of OH⁻ would be 2 * 5e-3 = 1e-2 M. Wait, is that right? Let me think again.

Wait, no. Ca(OH)₂ is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely into Ca²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole of Ca(OH)₂ gives one mole of Ca²+ and two OH⁻. So the concentration of OH⁻ would be 2 * 5e-3 M. Oh wait, 5e-4 moles in 0.1 L is 5e-3 M. So each mole yields two OH⁻, so 5e-3 * 2 = 1e-2 M of OH⁻ actually. So [OH⁻] = 1e-2 M.

But wait, wait. I'm getting the same answer here. Oh, wait, the pH is calculated from the OH⁻ concentration. So pH = -log [OH⁻] = -log(1e-2) = 2. But wait, that can't be right because the options don't go that low. The options are from 5 up to 14. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Wait, Ca(OH)₂ is actually a strong base, so it's a strong enough electrolyte that it dissociates completely. But wait, for a solution where the concentration is 0.005 M, which is 5e-3 M, and the pOH is 2, so pH is 12. Because pH + pOH =14. Oh right! So actually, the solution is basic. So the pH would be 14 - pOH. Wait, pOH is -log(1e-2) = 2. So pH is 14-2=12. But looking at the options, option D is 12. But wait, none of the options have 12 except option D.

Wait, the options: A is 6, B is 11, C is 13, D is 12, E is 10, F 14, G5, H9, I7, J8.

So the correct answer would be D:12.

But wait, are there any other factors I'm missing here? Like, maybe the solution isn't just the hydroxide ions, but considering the fully dissociated ions. Oh wait, Ca(OH)₂ is a strong base, so all the OH⁻ ions come from it. So the calculation should be correct. The [OH⁻] is 2 * 5e-3 = 1e-2. So pH is 12. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but none of the options say 12. Let me check the options again. Option D is 12. So yes, D is the correct choice.

To determine the pH of a saturated solution of the strong electrolyte Ca(OH)₂, we start by calculating the concentration of OH⁻ ions. The problem states that 5.0 × 10⁻⁴ moles of Ca(OH)₂ are added to 100 mL (0.1 L) of solution. The concentration of Ca(OH)₂ is:

\[
\text{Concentration of Ca(OH)₂} = \frac{5.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{L}} = 5.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]

Since Ca(OH)₂ dissociates completely in water:

\[
\text{Ca(OH)₂} \rightarrow \text{Ca²⁺} + 2 \, \text{OH⁻},
\]

each mole of Ca(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻. Therefore, the concentration of OH⁻ is:

\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = 2 \times 5.0 \times 10^{-3} = 1.0 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH of the solution is calculated as:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(1.0 \times 10^{-2}) = 2.
\]

Using the relationship between pH and pOH (\( \text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14 \)):

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 2 = 12.
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is 12, which corresponds to option D.
