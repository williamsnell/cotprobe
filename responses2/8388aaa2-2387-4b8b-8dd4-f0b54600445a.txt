Okay, so I've got this question about carbon-14 decay and how old a mummy is. Hmm, I remember that carbon-14 has a half-life, which is the time it takes for half of a radioactive isotope to decay. The half-life of carbon-14 is 5568 years. Right, and the problem says the mummy emits radiation from its body, and the count of C^14 is only one eighth of what's found in recent deaths. I need to figure out how old the mummy is.

Wait, so carbon-14 is radioactive, and it decays over time. The formula I think I should use is the radioactive decay equation. Let me recall that. The amount remaining after time t is given by N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where T is the half-life. But since it's a decay, I think it's N = N0 * (0.5)^(t / T). Alternatively, using the natural logarithm, I think another formula involves ln(remaining fraction). 

In this problem, the C^14 count is one-eighth of what it was when the person died recently. So the remaining fraction is 1/8. So I can set up the equation: (1/2)^(t / T) = 1/8. T is 5568 years. So I need to solve for t.

Hmm, how do I solve for t here. Let me think. Take the natural logarithm of both sides. So ln( (1/2)^(t / T) ) = ln(1/8). Using the logarithm power rule, that becomes (t / T) * ln(1/2) = ln(1/8). Then, solving for t: t = T * [ ln(1/8) / ln(1/2) ].

Wait, another approach: 1/8 is 2^-3. So (1/2)^(t/T) = 2^-3 => so (1/2)^(t/T) = (1/2)^3. So if (1/2)^x = (1/2)^y, then x must equal y. So t/T = 3. So t = 3 * T. So t would be 3 times the half-life. Oh wait, wait a second. No, because in the equation, it's (1/2)^(t/T) = 1/8, which is 2^-3. So (1/2)^(t/T) = 2^-3. So (1/2) = 2^-1. So (2^-1)^(t/T) = 2^-3. So 2^(-t/T) = 2^-3. So -t/T = -3 => t = 3T.

Wait, but wait, no, because (1/2)^(t/T) is equal to (2^-1)^(t/T) which is 2^(-t/T). And that's equal to 2^-3. So when I set exponents equal: -t/T = -3 → t = 3T. So t equals 3 times the half-life. So T is 5568 years. So t = 3 * 5568.

Calculating that: 5568 * 3. Let me compute that. 5000 *3 is 15000. 568 *3 is 1704. So 15000 + 1704 = 16704. So t is 16704 years old. Looking at the options, option A is 16,704 years old. 

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I mix up which is the numerator and denominator. Oh wait, no, in the equation, when you have N = N0 * (1/2)^(t/T), so the exponent is t divided by T. So in this case, our fraction is 1/8, which is 2^-3. So (1/2)^(t/T) = 2^-3. So if 1/2 is 2^-1, then (2^-1)^(t/T) is 2^(-t/T). So 2^(-t/T) = 2^-3 → -t/T = -3 → t =3T → 3*5568=16704.

So the mummy is about 16,704 years old. Looking at the options, option A is 16,704. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the age of the mummy, we use the half-life of carbon-14 (5568 years) and the fact that the remaining fraction of C^14 is one-eighth (1/8). The formula for radioactive decay is:

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / T}
\]

where \( N \) is the remaining amount, \( N_0 \) is the initial amount, \( t \) is the time elapsed, and \( T \) is the half-life. Given \( N / N_0 = 1/8 \), we set up:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / 5568} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Recognizing that \( 1/8 = 2^{-3} \) and \( 1/2 = 2^{-1} \), we rewrite the equation:

\[
\left(2^{-1}\right)^{t / 5568} = 2^{-3}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
2^{-t / 5568} = 2^{-3}
\]

Equating the exponents:

\[
-t / 5568 = -3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 3 \cdot 5568 = 16704 \, \text{years}
\]

Thus, the mummy is approximately 16,704 years old, corresponding to option A.
