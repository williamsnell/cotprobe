Okay, so I have this question about economics, specifically about marginal propensity to consume and how it affects real GDP. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that Tiger Woods buys a golf ball in England for $1. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) in England is 0.75. I need to find the total increase in real GDP resulting from this purchase.

Wait, I remember that marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of additional income that a person spends on consumption. So if someone has an income increase, and MPC is 0.75, they'll spend 75% of that income. But how does this transfer to the overall economy, like GDP?

Oh right! When an individual spends money, it becomes income for others, which in turn can be spent further, creating a chain reaction. This is the concept of the multiplier effect. The formula for the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 - MPC). So, if MPC is 0.75, 1 - MPC is 0.25. Dividing 1 by 0.25 gives 4. So the multiplier is 4.

Wait, but here's the catch: the question is about England's real GDP. So the initial purchase is $1, and this will create a multiplier effect. So the total increase in GDP would be the initial amount multiplied by the multiplier. That would be 1 * 4 = $4. That's option F.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me think again. So the MPC is 0.75, meaning for every additional dollar earned, 75 cents are spent. So the initial person's purchase of $1 becomes income for others. Those others spend 75%, which is 0.75 * 1 = $0.75. Then that person (the one who spent $0.75) has additional income, so they spend 75% of that. Let's see: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625. But this is getting smaller each time, leading to a geometric series. The total effect is the sum of all these, which is 1/(1-0.75) = 4.

So yes, the total increase in GDP is $4. So the answer should be F.

The correct answer is **F: $4**.

**Explanation:**
1. **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC):** 0.75 means that for every additional dollar earned, 75 cents are spent.
2. **Multiplier Effect:** The formula is \( \frac{1}{1 - MPC} \). With MPC = 0.75, \( 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \), so the multiplier is \( \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \).
3. **Total Increase in GDP:** The initial purchase is $1, so \( $1 \times 4 = $4 \).

**Answer:** F
