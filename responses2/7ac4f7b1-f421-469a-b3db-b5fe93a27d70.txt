Question:

Which of the following is the central limit theorem?

Options:

A: The central limit theorem states that the mean of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximately follow a normal distribution.
B: If the population is uniformly distributed, then as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes closer to a normal distribution.
C: No matter how the population is distributed, as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the sample means becomes closer to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.
D: If the population is normally distributed, then as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes closer to a normal distribution.
E: The central limit theorem states that the median of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximately follow a normal distribution.
F: The central limit theorem refers to something else.
G: The central limit theorem states that as the sample size increases, the median of the sample means becomes closer to the median of the population.
H: No matter how the population is distributed, as the sample size increases, the mean of the sample means becomes closer to the mean of the population.
I: Regardless of the distribution of the population, the variance of the sample means will converge to the variance of the population as the sample size increases.
J: The central limit theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximately follow a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original measurement distribution.

Okay, so I've got this question about the Central Limit Theorem, and I need to select the correct option from A to J. Hmm, let's see what I remember about the CLT.

The CLT, I think, is a fundamental concept in statistics. It says that if you have a population with a certain distribution, and you take sufficiently large samples, the distribution of the sample means will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. Oh wait, right, that's the main idea.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Says the mean of a large number of independent, identically distributed variables will follow a normal distribution. That sounds right, but wait, isn't it the sample mean that's normal? Or is it the distribution of the sample means?

Wait, no. Wait, the Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample means tends toward a normal distribution as the sample size increases. So the mean here refers to the sample mean. So option A is correct in that it states the sample means will approximately follow a normal distribution.

Option B: Says if the population is uniformly distributed, as sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes closer to normal. That also sounds correct, but wait, isn't that part of the CLT? Because the uniform distribution is just another case; the theorem doesn't specify the population's shape except that it must have a finite mean and variance.

Option C: States that as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the sample means becomes closer to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. Oh right, that's the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, which is the standard error. So that's also correct.

Option D: If population is normal, then as sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normal. Wait, but the population is already normal. So this statement is a bit confusing. Because if the population is normal, then the sample means are also normal, regardless of the sample size. So D might not be correctly applying the theorem, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Option E: Similar to C, just about the median. The CLT is about means, not medians. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Says the theorem refers to something else. That sounds odd. The theorem is definitely about the sample means approaching normal. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: States that the median of the sample means becomes closer to the population median. Again, the theorem is about the means, not medians. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Similar to E, about variance. The CLT is about the sample means, not the sum. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Says variance of the sample means converges to the population variance as sample size increases. Wait, no, the variance of the sample means is the population variance divided by n. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Correctly states that the sum of a large number of iid variables approximates normal, regardless of the original distribution. That's exactly the CLT. So J is correct.

Wait, let me double-check each option.

Option A: Correct, as it's about the sample means.

Option B: It's a correct statement but perhaps a specific case of the CLT.

Option C: Correct, which is another way of stating the CLT.

Option D: Maybe not correct, but the theorem says as the sample size increases, the sample mean is normal, regardless of the population's distribution, so D is correct.

Wait, no. Let me read D again. D says: "If the population is normally distributed, then as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes closer to a normal distribution." That's not correct because if the population is already normal, the sample means are also normal, regardless of sample size. So D is incorrect.

Option J says: "The central limit theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with finite mean and variance, will approximately follow a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original measurement distribution." Yes, that's exactly what the CLT says. So J is correct.

Wait, but let me think about each option's accuracy.

Option J is the most accurate because it correctly states the CLT.

Which other options are correct?

Option A: Correct.

Option B: Also correct. It's another version of the CLT.

Option C: Also correct, but perhaps less general than J.

Option D: Incorrect.

Option E: No, as it's about median.

Option F: Incorrect.

Option G: Incorrect.

Option H: No.

Option I: Incorrect.

Option J: Correct.

So the question is asking which is the correct answer. Oh wait, the question is asking which of the options is the correct statement regarding the CLT.

Wait, looking at the options, J is the correct statement about the CLT. Because J states that the sum of iid variables follows a normal distribution, regardless of the population.

So the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is **J**, which accurately describes the Central Limit Theorem.
