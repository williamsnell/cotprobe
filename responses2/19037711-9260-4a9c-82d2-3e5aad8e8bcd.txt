Okay, so I've got this question about GARCH and ARCH models. Hmm, let's think. I remember that GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, and ARCH is a specific case of GARCH.

The question is about comparing an ARCH(q) model with a GARCH(1,1) model. There are four statements (i, ii, iii, iv), and I need to determine which are true. Then, the options are combinations of these statements.

Let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement i: "The ARCH(q) model is likely to be the more parsimonious." Hmm, parsimonious means simple, right? More parsimonious implies that the model is simpler. I remember that GARCH models are generally more parsimonious than their simpler equivalents like pure ARCH. Because GARCH can account for more dynamics with fewer parameters, so it's more efficient. So I think statement i is true.

Statement ii: "The ARCH(q) model is the more likely to violate non-negativity constraints." Oh, right. The non-negativity constraint means that the variance can't be negative. In GARCH, each term in the model is squared, which is always positive, so GARCH inherently ensures variance is positive. For an ARCH(q) model, you have a sum of past squared returns multiplied by coefficients, but each of those squared terms is positive, so the sum can't be negative. Does that mean an ARCH(q) model can't violate non-negativity? Wait, because all the terms are positive, the sum must be positive. So an ARCH model can't make variance negative, so it's always positive. So statement ii says it's more likely to violate, which would be false. So statement ii is false.

Statement iii: "The ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance." Wait, in an ARCH(q) model, the past squared returns are squared and the model includes q lags. So the model would have terms like h_t = α_0 + α_1 * r_{t-1}^2 + ... + α_q * r_{t-q}^2. So it's a finite number of lags, not infinite. So statement iii says it's allowing for an infinite number. That's incorrect. So statement iii is false.

Statement iv: "The GARCH(1,1) model will usually be sufficient to capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance." Hmm, GARCH(1,1) has two parameters. It's a more flexible model than pure ARCH, but does it capture all dependence? Well, in many cases, GARCH models are considered adequate. I think they can model the conditional variance's dependence structure, but they might not capture everything perfectly, especially in very complex situations. So statement iv is probably true.

Wait, let me recap.

Statements:

i - True

ii - False

iii - False

iv - True

So the options given:

A: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only → includes false statements.

B: (iii) and (iv) only → includes false.

C: All four → wrong.

D: i, iii, iv → includes false.

E: ii and iii → both false.

F: i, ii, iii → includes false.

G: i and ii → both true? No, because ii is false.

H: i and iii → both false.

Wait, no. Wait, i is true, ii is false, iii is false, iv is true.

So the correct statements are i and iv.

Looking at the options:

Looking at the options, which include only i and iv. Let's check the options.

Option J: (i) and (iv) only. That would be the correct one.

Wait, but earlier I thought iv was true. So the statements that are true are i and iv. So the correct option is J.

Wait, let me double-check each statement.

i: yes, true.

ii: no, because GARCH always ensures positive variance, so it's not more likely to violate.

iii: no, because it's finite q lags.

iv: yes, GARCH(1,1) is sufficient.

So the correct answer is J: (i) and (iv) only.

To determine which statements about the comparison between the ARCH(q) and GARCH(1,1) models are true, let's analyze each statement:

- **Statement (i):** The ARCH(q) model is likely to be the more parsimonious.  
  This is true because GARCH models are generally more parsimonious as they can account for more dynamics with fewer parameters.

- **Statement (ii):** The ARCH(q) model is the more likely to violate non-negativity constraints.  
  This is false. Since GARCH inherently ensures positive variance through squared terms, an ARCH(q) model cannot violate non-negativity.

- **Statement (iii):** The ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance.  
  This is false. The ARCH(q) model includes only q lags, making it finite.

- **Statement (iv):** The GARCH(1,1) model will usually be sufficient to capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance.  
  This is true. GARCH(1,1) is considered adequate for capturing conditional variance dependence.

The true statements are (i) and (iv). Therefore, the correct option is **J: (i) and (iv) only**.
