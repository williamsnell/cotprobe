Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out how much water to add to a 90% ammonia solution to reduce it to 60%. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the initial solution is 5 gallons of 90% ammonia. That means in those 5 gallons, 90% is ammonia and the remaining 10% is water. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait again. Wait, 90% ammonia solution. So the solution is made up of NH3 and water. So in 5 gallons, 90% is NH3 and 10% is water. So the actual volume of ammonia is 5 * 0.9 = 4.5 gallons, and water is 5 * 0.1 = 0.5 gallons. So total volume is 5 gallons.

Now, we're adding water to dilute it. Let's say we add X gallons of water. So after adding X gallons, the total volume becomes 5 + X gallons. And the amount of ammonia remains the same, which is 4.5 gallons. But the concentration is now 60%. So the equation should be:

Ammonia / Total new volume = 60%

So 4.5 / (5 + X) = 0.6

Let me solve for X. Multiply both sides by (5 + X):

4.5 = 0.6*(5 + X)

Calculate 0.6*5 = 3, so 4.5 = 3 + 0.6X

Subtract 3 from both sides: 1.5 = 0.6X → X = 1.5 / 0.6 → X = 2.5 gallons.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure. So adding 2.5 gallons of water to the original 5 gallons would make the total volume 7.5 gallons. Then, the concentration of ammonia is 4.5 / 7.5 = 0.6, which is 60%. That matches, so that seems correct.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.5 gallons. So the answer should be A.

To determine how much water must be added to 5 gallons of a 90% ammonia solution to reduce it to a 60% solution, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Composition**: The solution is 5 gallons with 90% ammonia. This means:
   - Ammonia (NH₃): \( 5 \times 0.9 = 4.5 \) gallons
   - Water: \( 5 \times 0.1 = 0.5 \) gallons
   - Total volume: 5 gallons

2. **After Adding Water**: Let \( X \) be the gallons of water added. The new total volume becomes \( 5 + X \) gallons, and the amount of ammonia remains \( 4.5 \) gallons. The new concentration is 60%, so:
   \[
   \frac{4.5}{5 + X} = 0.6
   \]

3. **Solve for \( X \)**:
   \[
   4.5 = 0.6(5 + X) \\
   4.5 = 3 + 0.6X \\
   1.5 = 0.6X \\
   X = \frac{1.5}{0.6} = 2.5 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: Adding 2.5 gallons of water results in a 60% ammonia solution. 

The correct answer is **A: 2.5 gallons**.
