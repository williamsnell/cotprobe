Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about arguments for restricting trade. The question is asking which of the listed options is NOT an argument for restricting trade. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one isn't an argument. Let me think through each option.

First, I'll recall what I know about trade restrictions. Trade restrictions are often used to protect certain industries, promote certain sectors, or manage global trade. Some arguments include supporting local businesses, promoting diversity, employment, controlling markets, and protecting domestic industries. 

Option A is "To support local businesses." That makes sense because restricting trade could help small businesses not depend on big companies, which might have higher costs or regulations. So A is a valid argument.

Option B: "To promote a diversity of industries." I think that's true too. By restricting certain industries, you can introduce others. For example, if a country restricts steel production, it might open up the aluminum industry. So B is correct.

Option C: "To promote employment." Well, if trade is restricted, businesses might not have enough workers, leading to job losses. So promoting employment might actually be a negative outcome, which means C is not an argument. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe restricting trade can lead to more competition, which might not directly promote employment. Hmm, but the original question is about arguments for restricting trade. So if an argument is that it promotes employment, then C is a valid argument. Or maybe the argument is that it prevents employment, so C is not an argument. Wait, the question is which is NOT an argument. So if the argument is NOT promoting employment, but instead something else, then C would be the answer.

Option D: "To promote international relations." I'm not as sure about this. Promoting international relations might not be a direct argument for restricting trade. Maybe it's more about cooperation rather than trade restrictions. I'm not certain, but I think promoting international relations could be a reason, but I'm not sure if it's an argument for restricting trade. Alternatively, maybe it's an argument against trade restrictions, so D is not an argument for restricting trade.

Option E: "To control the market." I think controlling the market is a common argument for trade restrictions because it helps regulate prices and ensures fair competition. So E is a valid argument.

Option F: "To increase domestic competition." That sounds correct. If trade is restricted, domestic industries might compete more, which could lead to innovation and better products. So F is a valid argument.

Option G: "To protect infant industry." The infant industry might include something like pharmaceuticals or food safety. If trade is restricted, maybe the infant industry can expand. So G is a valid argument.

Option H: "To improve national security." I'm not sure how restricting trade affects national security. It might relate to protecting certain sectors from foreign interference, but I don't think this is a direct argument. So H might not be the answer.

Option I: "To fight inflation." Inflation can be a result of trade restrictions, like reducing imports and increasing domestic demand. So I is a valid argument.

Option J: "To protect the environment." Trade restrictions can sometimes protect certain industries from environmental damage, like protecting forests or reducing emissions. So J is a valid argument.

Now, going back to the options. The question is which is NOT an argument. So I need to find the one that isn't a pro-restriction argument.

Looking again, option C is promoting employment. If restricting trade leads to more job losses, then promoting employment would be a negative outcome. So promoting employment is not an argument for restricting trade, but rather a consequence. Therefore, option C is the correct answer because it's not an argument but a result.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any arguments for restricting trade that don't include promoting employment? For example, promoting diversity is an argument. Promoting a diversity of industries (B) is also an argument. Promoting international relations (D) – I'm a bit unsure here. Maybe promoting international relations isn't a direct argument for trade restrictions. So D might not be an argument. Alternatively, promoting a diversity of industries (B) is definitely an argument.

Wait, the options are A to J, each as an argument or not. So which one is not an argument. Let me think again:

The arguments for trade restrictions include:
- Supporting local businesses
- Promoting a diversity of industries
- Promoting employment
- Controlling market
- Increasing domestic competition
- Protecting infant industries
- Protecting the environment

Wait, so which of these is not an argument. Let me check each again.

Option C: Promoting employment – if trade restrictions are in place, it might lead to job losses. So this is not an argument for restricting trade, it's a possible consequence. Thus, C is the answer.

The argument for restricting trade is not promoting employment. If trade restrictions are in place, they often lead to job losses, which means promoting employment is not an argument for trade restrictions. 

Answer: C
