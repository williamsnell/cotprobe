Okay, so the question is about Erin making 12 pints of juice and drinking 3 cups each day. I need to figure out how many days it'll take her to finish all the juice. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I should convert the units so that both the juice she makes and her drinking rate are in the same measurement system. I know that 1 pint is equal to 2 cups. So, if she makes 12 pints, that's how many cups that is. Let me calculate that.

12 pints multiplied by 2 cups per pint equals 24 cups. So, she has 24 cups of juice. She drinks 3 cups each day. To find out how many days it takes, I need to divide the total cups by the cups she drinks daily.

So, 24 cups divided by 3 cups per day equals... let's see, 24 รท 3 is 8. That means it'll take her 8 days to finish all the juice.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. 12 pints, 2 cups each, so 12*2=24 cups. She drinks 3 cups a day, so 24/3=8. Yeah, that makes sense.

The calculation involves converting pints to cups and then dividing the total by the daily consumption.

12 pints = 24 cups (since 1 pint = 2 cups). She drinks 3 cups per day. So, 24 cups รท 3 cups/day = 8 days.

Answer: G: 8 days
