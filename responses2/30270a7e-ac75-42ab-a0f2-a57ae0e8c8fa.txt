Okay, so I've got this question about the digestive system and digestive enzymes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which organ in the digestive system doesn't secrete digestive enzymes. All the others do. So, looking at the options:

Options are A: mouth, B: stomach, C: gall bladder, D: small intestine.

Wait, enzymes are the small things produced by the digestive system, right? They break down food into smaller parts. So enzymes are produced in different parts. Let's think about each organ.

The mouth is where we eat food and eat it, so I know the stomach is where enzymes are made there. The small intestine is the part where digestion happens, so enzymes are made there as well. Gallbladder is the part that stores enzymes, I think. Oh right, the gallbladder is actually where the enzymes are stored temporarily before being released into the small intestine. So the gallbladder doesn't produce them; it just holds them.

So the question is asking which organ doesn't produce enzymes. So the answer must be C: gallbladder.

The correct answer is C: gallbladder. Gallbladder stores digestive enzymes temporarily before they are released into the small intestine. The other options (mouth, stomach, and small intestine) all produce enzymes.
