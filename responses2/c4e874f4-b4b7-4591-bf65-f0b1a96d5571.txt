Okay, so I've got this problem about the decay of uranium-238 into thorium-234 and helium-4. I'm supposed to calculate the energy released in this reaction. Hmm, right, this sounds like a nuclear reaction problem. I remember that when a reaction happens, especially in nuclear physics, the energy released or absorbed can be found using the mass defect. Oh wait, mass defect is the difference between the initial mass and the sum of the masses after the reaction, right?

So the reaction is: U-238 decays into Th-234 and He-4. The initial mass of U is 238.0508 amu, and the products are Th-234 (234.0437 amu) and He-4 (4.0026 amu). So the first step is to find the total mass of the products and subtract the initial mass to get the mass defect. Then, I think I have to convert that into energy using Einstein's equation E=mc². But wait, I remember that the mass unit is in atomic mass units (amu), and the energy is in energy units. Oh right, the conversion factor comes into play.

The question gives that 1.00073 amu is equal to 1.673 × 10^-24 grams. Wait, but in this problem, the units might complicate things. Alternatively, I remember that 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c². Oh wait, right, I think that's the conversion factor. So each amu is approximately 931.5 MeV of energy. So if I can find the mass defect in amu, multiply by 931.5 MeV/amu, I can get the energy released.

So the first step is to calculate the mass of the products. Let me add up the masses of Th-234 and He-4.

Th-234 is 234.0437 amu. He-4 is 4.0026 amu. Adding those together: 234.0437 +4.0026 = 238.0463 amu.

Wait, and the initial mass is 238.0508 amu. So the mass defect is the initial mass minus the sum of the products. So:

mass defect, Δm = 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu.

Hmm, let me double-check the numbers. 234.0437 +4.0026 = 238.0463. Yes, because 234.0437 +4 is 238.0437, plus 0.0026 is 238.0463. So the initial mass is 238.0508. Subtracting, 0.0045 amu.

Wait, so the mass defect is 0.0045 amu. Now, each amu is 931.5 MeV. So the energy is 0.0045 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, but MeV is mega-electron volts, which is a big unit. Oh wait, but the question asks for energy released, so it'll be in ergs. Oh right, because 1 eV is 1.602e-12 ergs, so 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, which is 1e6 * 1.602e-12 ergs = 1.602e-6 ergs per MeV.

So, let me compute that. 0.0045 amu * 931.5 MeV/amu.

0.0045 * 931.5 = ?

Let me calculate that: 0.0045 * 900 is 4.05, 0.0045 * 31.5 is 0.14175. So total is 4.05 + 0.14175 = 4.19175 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because each MeV is 1e6 eV, but the energy in ergs is (MeV) * (1.602e-12 erg/MeV).

Wait, no, wait. Let's correct that. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-13 erg, right? Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 joules, and 1 joule is 1e-7 erg. So 1 eV = 1e-19 J = 1e-19 * 1e7 erg = 1e-12 erg. So 1 MeV is 1e6 * 1e-12 erg = 1e-6 erg. So 1 MeV = 1e-6 ergs.

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. And 1 J = 1e7 erg, so 1 eV = 1.602e-12 erg. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV → 1e6 * 1.602e-12 erg = 1.602e-6 erg. So yes, 1 MeV equals 1.602e-6 erg. So each MeV is 1.602e-6 erg.

So back to the calculation: 4.19175 MeV × 1.602e-6 erg/MeV.

Wait, 4.19175 × 1.602e-6 = let's compute that.

4 *1.602e-6 = 6.408e-6. 0.19175 *1.602e-6 ≈ 0.19175 *1.602e-6 = approx 0.307e-6. So total is 6.408e-6 + 0.307e-6 = approx 6.715e-6 ergs.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it accurately. 4.19175 * 1.602e-6:

4 * 1.602e-6 = 6.408e-6.

0.19175 * 1.602e-6 = let's compute 0.19175 * 1.602e-6.

First, 0.1 *1.602e-6 is 0.1602e-6.

0.09 *1.602e-6: 0.09 *1.602 is 0.14418e-6.

0.00175 *1.602e-6: 0.00175 *1.602=0.0028035, so 0.0028035e-6.

Adding them: 0.1602e-6 + 0.14418e-6 = 0.30438e-6. Plus 0.0028035e-6 gives 0.3071835e-6.

So total is 6.408e-6 + 0.3071835e-6 = 6.7151835e-6 ergs. So approx 6.72e-6 erg. Looking at the options, option C is 6.72e-6 ergs. But wait, wait a second, because I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, the calculation for the mass defect: initial mass is 238.0508 and the products are 234.0437 + 4.0026 = 238.0463. So mass defect is 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu.

Yes. 0.0045 amu.

So 0.0045 * 931.5 MeV/amu = 4.19175 MeV.

Wait, 4.19175 MeV × 1.602e-6 erg/MeV = about 6.717e-6 erg. So the answer should be approximately 6.72e-6 ergs.

Looking back at the options, option C is 6.72 ×10^-6 ergs. So the correct answer is C.

To calculate the energy released in the radioactive decay of \( ^{238}_{92}\text{U} \) into \( ^{234}_{90}\text{Th} \) and \( ^{4}_2\text{He} \), we use the mass defect method. The reaction is:

\[
^{238}_{92}\text{U} \rightarrow ^{234}_{90}\text{Th} + ^{4}_2\text{He}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the mass defect
The mass defect (\( \Delta m \)) is the difference between the initial mass of \( ^{238}_{92}\text{U} \) and the sum of the masses of the products (\( ^{234}_{90}\text{Th} \) and \( ^{4}_2\text{He} \)):

\[
\Delta m = \text{Initial mass of } ^{238}_{92}\text{U} - \left( \text{Mass of } ^{234}_{90}\text{Th} + \text{Mass of } ^{4}_2\text{He} \right).
\]

Substituting the given masses:
\[
\Delta m = 238.0508 \, \text{amu} - (234.0437 \, \text{amu} + 4.0026 \, \text{amu}) = 0.0045 \, \text{amu}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert mass defect to energy
Using Einstein's equation \( E = mc^2 \), the energy released is related to the mass defect by:

\[
E = \Delta m \cdot c^2.
\]

In nuclear physics, \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \). Therefore, the energy in ergs is calculated as:

\[
E = \Delta m \cdot 931.5 \, \text{MeV/amu} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg/MeV}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta m = 0.0045 \, \text{amu} \):
\[
E = 0.0045 \cdot 931.5 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

First, calculate \( 0.0045 \cdot 931.5 \):
\[
0.0045 \cdot 931.5 = 4.19175 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Now multiply by \( 1.602 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg/MeV} \):
\[
E = 4.19175 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-6} = 6.717 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated energy is approximately \( 6.72 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg} \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
