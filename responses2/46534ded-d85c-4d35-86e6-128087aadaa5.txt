Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking me to translate the English sentence "Some animals are neglected by cruel people." into predicate logic using the given predicates. The options are A to I, each with different combinations.

First, I need to break down the sentence. The key parts are "some animals" and "are neglected by cruel people." So, "some" means there exists at least one, which in predicate logic is an existential quantifier. 

Let me list out the parts:
- "Some animals" refers to an object x that is an animal. So, Ax (x is an animal) is the predicate for that part. So, I'll need an existential quantifier for x with Ax.
- "Are neglected by cruel people." So, "x is neglected by y" where y is a cruel person. So, Nyx (x is neglected by y) would be the relation here. But wait, the subject of "neglected" is x, and the object is y. So, it's x neges y.

Putting it together, the structure is "There exists an x such that x is an animal and x is neglected by a cruel person." 

So, in predicate logic, that would be (∃x)(Ax • Nyx), but wait, the 'y' here is a person, as per the predicate Cx (x is cruel) and Px (x is a person). So, perhaps I need to relate x and y in the context of being a cruel person, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the sentence is "Some animals are neglected by cruel people." So, the animals are the subject, and "are neglected by cruel people" is the predicate. So, the object of the verb 'are' is "some animals," which are being neglected by cruel people. So, it's like, there exists an animal x such that x is being neglected by a person y who is cruel.

So, the structure would be: ∃x (Ax ∧ Nyx) where 'y' is a cruel person. But since 'y' is a cruel person, perhaps we can express this as ∃x (Ax ∧ Nyx) with y being a cruel person. But how do we tie that into the given predicates? 

Wait, looking at the options, the options use different structures. Let me look at each option.

Option A: (∃x)[(Cx • Py) • (∃y)(Ay • Nyx)] 
So, this says there exists an x that is cruel and a y that is an animal, and y neglects x. Wait, but the original sentence is about animals neglected by cruel people. So, 'x' in this option is an animal? Because 'Ay' is about x being an animal. And 'Ny x' is x being neglected by y. But in the original sentence, the 'x' is an animal, and 'y' is a person (the cruel person). So, maybe this is correct.

Option B: (∃x)[(Px • Ax) • (∃y)(Cy • Ny x)]
Px is person, Ax is animal. So, x is a person and animal? That can't be right because a person can't be an animal. So, this option is incorrect. So, B is out.

Option C: (∃x)[(Ax • Cx) • (∃y)(Py • Ny x)]
So, x is an animal and x is cruel, and there's a y who is a person, and y neglects x. But the original sentence is about animals being neglected by cruel people, not by people. So, this would say that some cruel people are animals, and those animals are neglected by people. That doesn't fit.

Option D: (∃x)[(Cx • Px) • (∃y)(Ay • Nxy)]
Cx is cruel, Px is person, Ay is animal, Nxy is x neglects y. So, it's saying there exists a person who is cruel, and there exists an animal x, who is neglected by x. Wait, but Nxy is x neges y. So, Nxy would be x neglects y. So, if x is the animal and y is a person, then Nxy is the animal x being neglected by the person y. So, this seems to align with the original sentence. Because it's some animal x being neglected by some person y who is cruel. So, the person y is 'cruel'—so, in this case, perhaps y is a cruel person. So, the option D would be: there exists a person y who is cruel, and there exists an animal x, who is neglected by y. But wait, the original sentence says some animals are neglected by cruel people. So, the 'y' in the original sentence is a cruel person. So, in D, it's 'Cx • Px' meaning y is a person and is cruel, but in the original sentence, it's x is a person and y is a cruel person. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the original sentence is saying that there exists an animal x and a person y, where y is cruel, and x is neglected by y. So, the structure would be (∃x)(∃y)(Ax ∧ Cx ∧ Py ∧ Nyx). But none of the options exactly match that.

Looking back, the correct structure should be: there exists an x (animal) such that x is neglected by a y (person), and y is a cruel person. So, the structure would be (∃x)(∃y)(Ax ∧ Cx ∧ Py ∧ Nyx). But none of the options have four quantifiers. Let's check the options.

Option A: (∃x)(Cx • Py • ∃y(Ay • Nyx)). So, x is a cruel person, y is an animal, and y neglects x. That's not exactly the same as the original sentence, because the original talks about x being neglected by a person who is cruel. So, the 'y' in the original is a person, but in A, it's an animal. So, maybe this is incorrect.

Option G: (∃x)(∃y){[(Ax • Px) • Cy] • Nyx)}. Wait, I'm not sure about this. Let me parse it. So, x is an animal and a person, and y is a person. Then, Cy is y is a cruel person, and Nyx is x is neglected by y. So, this would mean some animal and person x is a cruel person, and that same x is neglected by some person y. But in the original, it's some animals are neglected by cruel people, not some animals and people. So, G seems to have an extra 'and' which might not be needed.

Option E: (∃x)(∃y){[(Ax • Px) • (Cy • Nxy)]}. So, x is an animal and a person, y is a person, and y neglects x. So, same as A but perhaps without the 'C' predicate. So, perhaps this is incorrect because it doesn't require y to be a cruel person.

Looking for the correct structure: the correct statement is that some animal is neglected by a cruel person, so there exists an x (animal), exists a y (person), y is cruel, and x is neglected by y.

Looking at the options:

Option A: x is a cruel person (Cx), y is an animal (Ay), and y neglects x (Ny x). So, the structure is (Cx ∧ Py) ∧ (Ay ∧ Ny x). So, that would mean some (cruel person) y is an animal, who in turn is neglected by that y. But the original sentence is "some animals are neglected by cruel people." So, the 'y' in the original is a person (the cruel person), and the 'x' is the animal. So, the correct structure should be: an animal x is neglected by a person y who is cruel. So, the correct predicate would be that y is cruel (Cy), and y is a person, and y neges x.

Wait, but the 'x' in the original is an animal, and 'y' is a person (the 'cruel' person). So, the correct statement would be: there exists an animal x, and a person y, who is cruel, and x is neglected by y.

So, the correct predicate would be: (Ax ∧ Cy ∧ Py) ∧ (Ny x).

But looking at the options, I don't see that exact structure. Let me look again.

Option A: (∃x)(Cx • Py • ∃y)(Ay • Nyx)
So, x is a cruel person, y is an animal, and y neges x.

That's (Cx ∧ Py) ∧ (Ay ∧ Nyx). So, that's correct in terms of x being an animal and y being a person. But it's saying that some cruel person y is an animal x, and that x is neglected by y. That might not be the same as the sentence which is about some animals being neglected by a cruel person.

Wait, the sentence is about some animals being neglected by a cruel person. So, the animal x is being neglected by a person y, and y is a cruel person. So, the correct structure is: there exists an x (animal), and a y (person), where y is cruel, and x is neglected by y.

So, the correct statement is (∃x)(Ax ∧ ∃y)(Cy ∧ Py ∧ Nyx). So, in predicate logic, that would be (∃x)(Ax ∧ ∃y)(Cy ∧ Py ∧ Nyx). But looking at the options, perhaps that's not directly presented.

Wait, looking at option G: (∃x)(∃y){[(Ax • Px) • Cy] • Nyx)}. So, x is an animal and a person, y is a person, and y neges x. So, that would translate to some animal and person x being neglected by some person y. But this would mean that the same person y is the one who is a cruel person? Because in option G, Cy is y is a cruel person. Because in G, the structure is [(Ax • Px) • Cy], which means y is a person, and y is a cruel person. So, the correct structure would be that some animal x is neglected by a cruel person y (Cy), and that y is a person (but maybe that's redundant here). Wait, but in G, it's (Cy), so y is a cruel person. So, G says that some x is an animal and a person (but that's redundant, since all animals are, but in logic, it's a predicate), and y is a cruel person, and y is a person who neglects x.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is: some animal x is neglected by a cruel person y.

So, the correct structure would be (∃x)(∃y)(Ax ∧ Cx ∧ Py ∧ Nyx). But looking for that in the options.

Looking at option A: (∃x)(Cx • Py • ∃y)(Ay • Nyx). So, x is a cruel person, y is an animal, and y neges x. So, that's (Cx ∧ Py) ∧ (Ay ∧ Nyx). So, that would mean that some (cruel person y) is an animal x, which in turn is neglected by that same y. But this isn't the same as the original sentence, which is about x (an animal) being neglected by some (cruel) person y.

So, option A is incorrect because it's saying that some cruel person y is an animal x, which then is neglected by y. That would be (Cx ∧ Py) ∧ (Ay ∧ Nyx). Wait, but in the original, the y is a person, and the x is the animal. So, the correct structure should be that there exists an animal x and a person y, where y is a cruel person, and x is neglected by y.

So, in terms of the logical structure, it's (∃x)(∃y)(Ax ∧ Py ∧ Cy ∧ Nyx). So, none of the options present this exactly. Let's look again.

Option G: (∃x)(∃y){[(Ax • Px) • Cy] • Nyx)}. So, x is an animal and a person (so, that makes x both an animal and a person, which is redundant), and y is a cruel person, and y is a person who neges x. So, this would mean that some animal x is neglected by a cruel person y. So, this seems to match the original sentence. Because the x is an animal (so x is an animal), and y is a cruel person, and y is a person, and y is the one who neglects x.

Wait, but option G has (Cy), which is that y is a cruel person, but in the original, the person is a cruel person, so that would match. So, option G: (∃x)(∃y){[(Ax • Px) • Cy] • Nyx)}. That's (Ax and Px) so x is an animal and a person (meaning x is both), but that's redundant. So, the structure is that y is a cruel person, and y is a person, and y is a person who neges x.

Wait, but the original sentence is "some animals are neglected by cruel people." So, the 'x' in the original is an animal, and 'y' is a person (the cruel one). So, the correct structure is (∃x)(∃y)(Ax ∧ Py ∧ Cy ∧ Nyx). So, that would be the correct translation.

Looking at the options, option G: (∃x)(∃y){[(Ax • Px) • Cy] • Nyx)}. That's (Ax and Px) so x is an animal and a person (meaning x is both), but in the original, the x is an animal, and the y is a person who is a cruel person. So, option G is correct because it says that there exists x (an animal, and a person) and a y (the cruel person) who is a person, and y (the cruel person) is a person who neges x.

Wait, but in the original sentence, x is an animal, and y is a person (the cruel one). So, the correct structure should be (∃x)(∃y)(Ax ∧ Px ∧ Cy ∧ Nyx). But in option G, it's (Ax • Px) which is redundant, but the important part is Cy (y is a cruel person) and Nyx (y is a person who neges x). So, option G seems to fit, because it's saying x is an animal and a person (so x is both), and y (the person) is a cruel person, and y is a person who neglects x.

Wait, but in the original, the sentence is about "some animals are neglected by cruel people." So, the 'y' is a cruel person, and the 'x' is an animal. So, in option G, 'x' is both an animal and a person, which is correct, and 'y' is a person who is a cruel person and is a person who neglects x. So, that seems to fit.

Alternatively, option A has x as a cruel person and y as an animal, which doesn't fit because the original is about animals being neglected by a cruel person, not the other way around.

So, option G seems to correctly capture the structure. Therefore, the correct answer is option G.
</think>

To translate the sentence "Some animals are neglected by cruel people" into predicate logic, we need to identify the correct predicates and their relationships. The sentence refers to animals (x) being neglected by cruel people (y). The correct structure should involve an existential quantifier for animals (x) and an existential quantifier for cruel people (y), with the relation that x is neglected by y.

Analyzing the options, option G correctly captures this structure: (∃x)(∃y){[(Ax • Px) • Cy] • Nyx}. Here, x is an animal and a person (which is redundant due to the conjunction), y is a cruel person, and y is a person who neglects x. This matches the original sentence's meaning.
