Okay, so I have this question about a retailer's footwear database, and I need to figure out which of the options can be determined using only the given information. Let me read the question again carefully.

The database contains information about each item, including item ID, type (sneakers, boots, sandals), selling price, size, color, and quantity available. So each record in the database is a specific piece of footwear item.

Now, the question asks which of the options can be determined using only this database. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Which items are not in the store. Hmm, the database only includes the items in the store. The question doesn't mention tracking which ones are missing. So I don't think we can determine which items are out based on the data alone. We can know which items are present, but not which are not. So A might not be possible.

Option B: Which type of footwear is most popular among adults. Well, the database includes the type for each item. So if we can figure out how many adults bought each type, we can determine which is most popular. But wait, the question is about adults specifically. The database doesn't track gender, so unless we know how many of each type were sold to adults, we can't know this. So B is probably not directly possible with the given data.

Option C: The total profit from a particular footwear type. Profit would depend on cost and selling price. The database has selling prices, but not costs. So we can't calculate profit. Unless the retailer has some other way to know costs, like from inventory or previous sales, but that's not mentioned. So C can't be determined from the given info.

Option D: Which colors are more popular among men than women. The database includes color data but doesn't track gender. So unless we have another dataset that includes gender info, we can't determine this. So D seems out of reach without additional data.

Option E: The total number of shoes sold in a particular month. The database has quantity available, which is the number of shoes of that type. So if we know the quantities for each month, we can sum them up to get the total sold. That makes sense. So E can be determined.

So the correct answer should be E.

E: The total number of shoes sold in a particular month.

The correct answer is E. The database contains the quantity available for each item, and by tracking the quantity sold over a month, we can determine the total number of shoes sold. 

Answer: E
