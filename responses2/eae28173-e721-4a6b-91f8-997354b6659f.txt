Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that the entire power from a 100-hp automobile engine is used to agitate 50 kg of water. The water is thermally insulated, and they want to know how long it will take for the water's temperature to rise by 10 degrees Celsius. The options are from A to J, each with different seconds.

Hmm, I remember that power is related to energy and time. Oh right, power is work done per unit time. So power (P) equals energy (E) divided by time (t). So, P = E/t. Therefore, time is E divided by P.

But wait, the engine is 100 horsepower. I'm a bit fuzzy on the units here. Horsepower is a unit of power, but I'm not exactly sure what its equivalent is in watts. Let me think. Oh yeah, 1 horsepower is about 746 watts. So 100 horsepower would be 74600 watts. That's a lot!

So the engine's power is 74600 W. The engine's power is used to agitate the water. So the energy provided by the engine is the power multiplied by time, E = P * t.

Wait, but the problem is about heating the water. The heat energy required to raise the temperature of the water can be calculated using the formula Q = m * c * ΔT, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the temperature change.

What's the specific heat capacity of water? Oh right, it's 4186 J/(kg·°C). The mass is 50 kg, and ΔT is 10°C. So Q = 50 kg * 4186 J/kg°C * 10°C. Let's compute that.

50 * 4186 is 209300, multiplied by 10 is 2,093,000 J. So the heat needed is 2,093,000 Joules.

Now, the engine's power is 74600 W, which is 74600 J/s. So the time it takes is Q divided by P. So t = 2,093,000 J / 74600 J/s.

Let me do the division. 2,093,000 / 74600. Let me see, 74600 times 28 is 2,088,800 (because 74600 * 28: 74600 * 20 is 1,492,000; 74600 * 8 is 596,800; sum is 2,088,800). And 2,093,000 minus 2,088,800 is 4200. So 4200/74600 is approximately 0.0565. So total time is approximately 28.0565 seconds.

Looking at the options, the closest one is 28 seconds. So option C is 28 s. So the answer should be C.

To determine how long it takes for the temperature of 50 kg of water to rise by 10°C, we use the principle that power (P) is energy (E) divided by time (t), so \( P = \frac{E}{t} \). Rearranging, \( t = \frac{E}{P} \).

The engine's power is given as 100 horsepower. Converting this to watts:  
\[ 1 \, \text{horsepower} = 746 \, \text{watts}, \quad \text{so} \, 100 \, \text{horsepower} = 74600 \, \text{watts}. \]

The energy required to raise the temperature of the water is calculated using the formula for heat transfer:  
\[ Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T, \]  
where \( m = 50 \, \text{kg} \), \( c = 4186 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)} \), and \( \Delta T = 10 \, \text{°C} \). Substituting,  
\[ Q = 50 \cdot 4186 \cdot 10 = 2,093,000 \, \text{J}. \]

Using \( t = \frac{E}{P} \), the time required is:  
\[ t = \frac{2,093,000}{74600} \approx 28.06 \, \text{seconds}. \]

The closest option to this value is **28 seconds**. Thus, the correct answer is **C: 28 s**.
