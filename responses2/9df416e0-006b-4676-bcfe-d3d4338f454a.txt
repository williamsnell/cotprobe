Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says: We have a random sample of size 36 from an exponential distribution with mean 3. We need to approximate the probability that the sample mean, denoted X_bar, is between 2.5 and 4. The options are given from A to J.

First, I remember that for a sample mean, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies. So, the distribution of the sample mean X_bar should be approximately normal, regardless of the original distribution, as long as the sample size is large enough. Here, the sample size is 36, which is pretty big, so CLT should definitely apply.

The exponential distribution has a mean (λ = 1/mean value). In this case, the mean is 3, so λ is 1/3. The exponential distribution is skewed to the right, which means the mean and median are different. But since we're dealing with a large sample size, the distribution of the sample mean should be approximately normal, even though the original distribution is exponential.

The next step is to find the mean and variance of the sample mean.

The mean of the exponential distribution is μ = 3. So, the mean of X_bar (which is the sample mean) should also be μ = 3.

The variance of an exponential distribution is given by Var = μ². So, that's 3² = 9. But wait, the variance of the sample mean is the variance of the population divided by n. So, the variance of X_bar is Var(X_bar) = Var(X) / n = 9 / 36. Let me compute that: 9 divided by 36 is 0.25. So, the standard deviation of X_bar is the square root of 0.25, which is 0.5.

So, X_bar follows a normal distribution with mean μ = 3 and standard deviation σ = 0.5.

Now, I need to find the probability that X_bar is between 2.5 and 4. To calculate this, I should standardize these values into Z-scores.

The formula for Z-score is Z = (X - μ) / σ.

For the lower bound, X = 2.5:
Z_low = (2.5 - 3) / 0.5 = (-0.5) / 0.5 = -1.

For the upper bound, X = 4:
Z_high = (4 - 3) / 0.5 = 1 / 0.5 = 2.

So, we need to find P(-1 ≤ Z ≤ 2), which is the probability that Z is between -1 and 2.

I can find this probability by using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator.

Looking up the Z-scores:

- Z = -1 corresponds to the cumulative probability of 0.1587. Because in the standard normal distribution, the area to the left of Z=-1 is about 0.1587.
- Z = 2 corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.9772. That's because the area to the left of Z=2 is 0.9772.

So, the probability between Z=-1 and Z=2 is 0.9772 - 0.1587 = 0.8185.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the standard normal distribution values. Alternatively, I can think about the Z-table.

Alternatively, I can use the empirical rule. But perhaps it's easier to just compute the areas.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

The mean was 3, variance 9 (so standard deviation 3), and for n=36, variance of X_bar is 9/36 = 0.25, standard deviation is 0.5. So, X_bar ~ N(3, 0.5²).

So, the Z-scores for 2.5 and 4 are indeed (-1) and 2.

The area from Z=-1 to Z=2 is the probability of P(Z ≤ 2) minus P(Z ≤ -1). 

Looking up:

P(Z ≤ 2) is 0.97725.

P(Z ≤ -1) is 0.15866.

Subtracting: 0.97725 - 0.15866 = 0.81859.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.8185. So the correct answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) since the sample size is large (n=36). The sample mean, $\bar{X}$, follows a normal distribution with mean $\mu = 3$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 0.5$. The Z-scores for the bounds are calculated as $Z = \frac{2.5 - 3}{0.5} = -1$ and $Z = \frac{4 - 3}{0.5} = 2$. The probability between $Z = -1$ and $Z = 2$ is approximately $0.8185$, which corresponds to option I.
