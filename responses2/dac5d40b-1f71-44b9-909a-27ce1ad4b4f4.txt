Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about waves on a pool of water. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the frequency of the oscillating source on the surface is 3 Hz. I remember that frequency (f) is the number of waves that pass a point per second. So, if the frequency is 3 Hz, that's 3 cycles per second.

Then it asks about the speed of the wave, but the wavelength is observed as 0.5 meters. Wavelength (λ) is the distance between two consecutive points in phase on a wave. So the problem gives me both frequency and wavelength and wants the speed.

Hmm, I think I remember a formula that relates these three quantities. Oh right, it's the wave speed equation. Speed (v) equals frequency (f) multiplied by wavelength (λ). So v = f * λ.

Wait, let me make sure I got the formula right. Yeah, I think that's right. So plugging in the numbers: f is 3 Hz, λ is 0.5 m. So v = 3 * 0.5.

3 times 0.5 is 1.5. So the speed should be 1.5 meters per second.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.5 m/s. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, let me double-check everything. Frequency 3 Hz—so 3 cycles per second. Wavelength 0.5 m—that's pretty short. So the speed would be 3 * 0.5 = 1.5. Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is D.

To determine the speed of the wave, we use the wave speed formula:

\[
v = f \times \lambda
\]

Given:
- Frequency (\(f\)) = 3 Hz
- Wavelength (\(\lambda\)) = 0.5 m

Substituting the values:

\[
v = 3 \times 0.5 = 1.5 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The correct answer is **1.5 m/s**, which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
