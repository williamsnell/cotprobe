Alright, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve. The equation is 9y'' +12y' +4y =0, with initial conditions y(0)=a>0 and y'(0)=-1. I need to find the critical value of a that separates solutions that become negative from those that are always positive. The options are from A to J, with some numbers like 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.5, up to 3.5.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, we usually find the characteristic equation. So let's do that. The equation is 9y'' +12y' +4y =0. The characteristic equation would be 9r² +12r +4=0. 

Wait, let me write that down: 9r² +12r +4=0. I can try to factor this or use the quadratic formula. Let me try the quadratic formula. 

The quadratic formula is r = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=9, b=12, c=4. So plugging in, r = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 144)]/(18). Because 4ac is 9*4*1? Wait, wait, no, wait. The equation is 9r² +12r +4=0, so a=9, b=12, c=4. So discriminant is b²-4ac = 144 - 4*9*4. Wait, 4*9 is 36, times 4 is 144. So discriminant is 144-144=0. 

Oh, so the discriminant is zero, which means we have a repeated root. So r = [-12 ± 0]/18 = -12/18 = -2/3. So the general solution is y(t) = (C1 + C2 t) e^(-2t/3). 

Now, applying the initial conditions. At t=0, y(0) = a. So y(0) = (C1 + C2*0) e^0 = C1 = a. So C1 is a. 

Next, the derivative y'(t) is derivative of (C1 + C2 t) e^(-2t/3). Let's compute that. Using product rule: d/dt [ (C1 + C2t) e^(-2t/3) ] = C2 e^(-2t/3) + (C1 + C2t)(-2/3 e^(-2t/3)). 

So y'(t) = e^(-2t/3) [ C2 - (2/3)(C1 + C2t) ].

At t=0, y'(0) = -1. So plug in t=0: y'(0) = e^0 [ C2 - (2/3)(C1 + 0) ] = 1*(C2 - (2/3)C1) = -1. 

So we have: C2 - (2/3)C1 = -1. But C1 is a, so substituting: C2 - (2/3)a = -1 → C2 = (2/3)a -1.

So now, the solution is y(t) = [a + ( (2/3)a -1 ) t ] e^(-2t/3).

I need to find the critical value of a where the solution changes from always positive to becoming negative. Hmm, when does y(t) change sign? It's when y(t) =0 for some t. But for the solution to always stay positive, y(t) >0 for all t ≥0. So the critical a is the value where y(t) touches zero for some t, but doesn't go negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution just touches zero, meaning it's a point where y(t) =0 and y’(t)=0? Wait, maybe not necessarily. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the behavior depends on the sign of the coefficient in the exponent. Since the exponent is negative, as t increases, e^(-2t/3) tends to zero. So the solution will decay to zero as t approaches infinity. So the solution is a decaying exponential multiplied by a linear term.

But the question is about when the solution transitions from always positive to becoming negative. So perhaps for a certain a, the solution is always positive, but for a larger a, it starts to dip below zero.

Wait, but perhaps I should analyze when the function y(t) is positive or negative. Let me think about the general solution: y(t) = [a + ( (2/3)a -1 ) t ] e^(-2t/3).

Since e^(-2t/3) is always positive, the sign of y(t) depends on the coefficient [a + (2/3 a -1) t ].

So the expression inside the brackets, a + (2/3 a -1) t, must be positive for y(t) to be positive, and negative otherwise.

So the critical a is when this expression becomes zero for some t. Wait, but wait. Suppose a is such that at t=0, the coefficient is a, which is positive. As t increases, the coefficient decreases, because (2/3 a -1) could be positive or negative.

Hmm, because the coefficient is a + ( (2/3 a -1) ) t. Let me write it as a + (2/3 a -1) t.

If 2/3 a -1 is positive, then as t increases, the coefficient becomes more positive, so y(t) stays positive. If 2/3 a -1 is negative, then as t increases, the coefficient decreases, possibly crossing zero.

Wait, but wait, the coefficient is a + (2/3 a -1) t. So when does a + (2/3 a -1) t = 0? Solving for t:

t = -a / (2/3 a -1 )

But t must be positive (since we're considering t ≥0), so the solution y(t) will be zero when a + (2/3 a -1) t =0.

Let me denote C = (2/3 a -1). Then the numerator is a, denominator is C. So t = a / (2/3 a -1 )

But for t to be positive, the denominator (2/3 a -1) must have the same sign as the numerator a.

Since a>0, denominator must be positive so that t is positive. So 2/3 a -1 >0 → a> 3*(1/2) = 3/2 = 1.5.

Wait, so if a>1.5, then the denominator 2/3 a -1 is positive, so t is positive. So at that t, y(t) is zero.

Wait, but the problem is to find the critical value of a where y(t) transitions from always positive to becoming negative. So perhaps when a is equal to 1.5, the solution y(t) just touches zero.

Wait, let's think again. When a is 1.5, then 2/3 a is 1, so 2/3 a -1=0. So the coefficient becomes a + 0*t = a. So y(t)= a e^(-2t/3), which is always positive. So for a=1.5, the solution is always positive.

But when a is larger than 1.5, say a=2, then 2/3 a is 4/3, so 4/3 -1=1/3. So coefficient becomes 2 + (1/3) t. At t=0, it's 2; as t increases, it decreases. So for a>1.5, the coefficient will eventually become zero at some t>0, and then y(t) will become zero and then negative for t beyond that point.

Wait, but wait. Wait, when a=1.5, the coefficient is a=1.5, so y(t)=1.5 e^(-2t/3), which is always positive. But when a>1.5, say a=2, the coefficient is 2 + (2/3 *2 -1 ) t → 2 + (4/3 -1)t = 2 + (1/3)t. So as t increases, the coefficient increases (since (1/3) is positive), so the coefficient starts at 2 and increases with t. Wait, but that can't be right because if 2/3 a -1 is positive, the coefficient a + (2/3 a -1) t would increase as t increases. Wait, no, wait, no: actually, for a>1.5, 2/3 a -1 is positive because 2/3 a >1 for a>1.5. So the coefficient a + (positive) t would increase as t increases. So at t=0, it's a>1.5, and it's increasing. So y(t) would always be positive because the coefficient is always positive. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, when a>1.5, 2/3 a -1 is positive. So the coefficient is a + (positive) t. So as t increases, the coefficient increases. So y(t) is the product of that coefficient (positive) and e^(-2t/3), which is always positive. So y(t) would be positive for all t if a>1.5. So the solution remains positive for all t, but when a=1.5, the coefficient is a=1.5 at t=0, but as t increases, it's 1.5 + (1/3) t, which is positive for all t. So in that case, the solution is always positive. So perhaps my initial analysis is wrong.

Wait, but that can't be right because, for example, if a is very large, say a=10. Then the coefficient is 10 + ( (2/3 *10) -1 ) t → 10 + (20/3 -1) t → 10 + (17/3)t. So at any t, the coefficient is positive, so y(t) is always positive.

Wait, so that suggests that for all a>0, the solution is always positive. But that can't be right because the problem states that the solution could become negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the coefficient. Let me re-express the solution.

The solution is y(t) = [a + ( (2/3 a -1) ) t ] e^(-2t/3).

Let me compute for a>1.5, the 2/3 a -1 is positive. So for small t, the coefficient is a, which is positive. As t increases, the coefficient increases, so it's a positive number increasing. So y(t) is always positive, because both the coefficient and the exponential are positive, so their product is positive.

But then, when a=1.5, the coefficient becomes 1.5 + (1/3) t. So at t=0, it's 1.5. For t>0, it's greater than 1.5. So y(t) remains positive.

Wait, but the problem says that the solution can become negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe I need to think about the behavior of y(t) as t increases beyond some point.

Wait, perhaps I should analyze the condition where y(t) is always positive. Maybe the condition is that the coefficient [a + (2/3 a -1) t ] is always positive.

Wait, the coefficient is a + (2/3 a -1) t. Let me set this equal to zero and see when t is positive.

Set a + (2/3 a -1) t = 0 → t = -a/(2/3 a -1 )

Denominator: 2/3 a -1. So for t to be positive, the denominator must have the same sign as the numerator (a is positive). So denominator must be positive. So 2/3 a -1 >0 → a> 3*(1/2) → a>1.5.

So when a>1.5, t is negative, which is not in our domain of t≥0, so for a>1.5, the coefficient is always positive because for t≥0, the coefficient starts at a>1.5 and increases. So y(t) is always positive.

Wait, but that can't be right because when a is larger than 1.5, the coefficient is a + something positive times t. So it's always positive. So the solution is always positive.

Wait, but the problem says the solution can become negative. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the analysis. Maybe the correct condition is when the coefficient [a + (2/3 a -1) t ] is zero for some t≥0. Wait, but that would only happen when a + (2/3 a -1) t =0, which for t positive is possible only if 2/3 a -1 is positive, but then a must be greater than 1.5.

Wait, but then when a>1.5, the coefficient [a + (2/3 a -1) t ] is always positive for all t ≥0 because the coefficient starts at a (which is >1.5) and increases. So y(t) is always positive.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the solution can become negative. So perhaps the critical a is when [a + (2/3 a -1) t ] is zero. But that would only happen when a + (2/3 a -1) t =0 → t= -a/(2/3 a -1). But for this to be positive, the denominator must be negative because a is positive.

Wait, if 2/3 a -1 is negative, then denominator is negative. Then t = -a/(2/3 a -1) → since denominator is negative, and a is positive, t would be positive.

So when 2/3 a -1 is negative, which is when a < 3/2 =1.5. In that case, when a <1.5, 2/3 a -1 is negative. So the coefficient [a + (negative) t ].

So for a <1.5, let's see what happens. Let's plug in a=1. Let's compute the coefficient: 1 + (2/3 *1 -1) t → 1 + (-1/3) t → 1 - (t/3). So the coefficient is 1 - t/3. So for a=1, the coefficient is 1 - (t/3). So when t=3, it becomes zero. For t>3, it's negative.

So for a=1, y(t) would be [1 - (t/3)] e^(-2t/3). So when t=3, the coefficient is zero, and for t>3, it's negative. So y(t) is zero at t=3 and becomes negative after that.

Wait, but the problem is about the critical a where for a above this value, the solution becomes negative, and below, it remains positive. So the critical a is 1.5 because when a=1.5, the coefficient is always positive. So for a>1.5, the coefficient increases beyond 1.5, so y(t) remains positive. For a=1.5, the coefficient is a=1.5, but for a=1.5, the coefficient is 1.5 + (1/3) t, which increases. So y(t) would always be positive.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that for a>1.5, the solution is always positive, and for a<1.5, it can become negative. So the critical value is a=1.5. So the answer is option B: 1.5.
</think>

The critical value of \( a \) is 1.5, as for \( a > 1.5 \), the solution remains positive, while for \( a < 1.5 \), the solution becomes negative. Thus, the critical value is \( a = 1.5 \).

Answer: B
