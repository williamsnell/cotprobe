Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two bicycle tires and their stopping distances. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

So the setup: two tires are rolling with the same initial speed of 3.5 m/s on a straight road. The distance each travels before its speed is reduced by half is measured. One tire is at 40 psi, goes 18.1 meters. The other is at 105 psi, goes 92.9 meters. We need to find the coefficient of rolling friction for each, assuming the net force is rolling friction only.

Wait, I remember that when you have a tire rolling without slipping, the deceleration is due to friction. The distance it travels before speed is halved relates to the stopping distance. The formula I think is useful here is kinematic motion: the distance covered is (v^2 - u^2)/(2a), where v is final speed, u initial, a acceleration.

But wait, since the speed is being reduced by half, so the final speed v would be u/2. Oh wait, but wait, the direction of acceleration here is opposite to the initial velocity, so the acceleration a is negative. So the formula would be (u² - (u/2)^2)/(2*(-a)), but let's see. The actual distance s is (u² - (u/2)^2) / (2a), but since a is negative, the denominator is negative. So s = (u² (1 - 1/4 )) / (2|a|) ) = (3u²)/(8a) (but a is negative, so 3u²/(8*(-a)) → 3u²/(8|a|)).

Wait, the equation: s = (u² - (v²))/(2a), but since v = u/2, v² = u²/4. So s = (u² - u²/4) / (2a) → (3u²/4) / (2a) → 3u²/(8a). But a is negative because it's deceleration, so 3u²/(8*(-a)) → 3u²/(8|a|). So, yeah, s = (3u²)/(8a), but since a is negative, the denominator is negative, making s positive.

Wait, so I can rearrange that: solving for |a| (the magnitude), a is -|a|. So, s = (3u²)/(8*(-a)) → |a| = (3u²)/(8s). Because a is negative, so |a| is positive.

Wait, no, the equation is s = (u² - v²)/(2a) → since v is less than u, (u² - v²) is positive. When a is negative, the denominator is negative, so s is positive. So solving for a: a = (u² - v²)/(2s*(-1)) )? Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, let's approach it step by step.

Given: initial speed u = 3.5 m/s. At the end, speed is v = u/2 = 1.75 m/s. The distance covered is s.

Using the kinematic equation: v² = u² + 2 a s. Because the acceleration a is negative (deceleration), so the equation becomes:

v² = u² + 2 (a) s → rearranged, a = (v² - u²)/(2s)

Wait, but if v is less than u, then v² - u² is negative, so a is negative, which makes sense.

So, let's compute a for each tire.

First, for the 40 psi tire (Option A's first value):

u = 3.5 m/s, v = 1.75 m/s, s = 18.1 m.

a = (v² - u²)/(2s) → (1.75² - 3.5²)/(2 * 18.1)

1.75² is 3.0625; 3.5² is 12.25. So (3.0625 - 12.25) = -9.1875. Divided by (2 * 18.1) = 36.2.

So a = -9.1875 / 36.2 → approximately -0.2538 m/s².

But wait, that's the acceleration, but since it's deceleration, the magnitude is 0.2538 m/s².

But the coefficient of rolling friction can be found using the relation F_friction = m * a. But wait, wait, the force is F_friction = μ N, where N is the normal force. Since the road is level, N = mg, so F_friction = μ m g.

So the frictional force is μ m g. But how does that relate to the deceleration a?

Wait, Newton's second law: F_net = m a. The net force here is the frictional force, so F_friction = m a → μ m g = m a → μ g = a. So μ = a / g.

Ah, that's the key. So once we find a, the acceleration (in magnitude), we can compute μ as a/g, where g is 9.8 m/s².

Wait, but wait, a is computed as (v² - u²)/(2s). But in our case, v is less than u, so (v² - u²) is negative, so a is negative. But when we take the magnitude, |a| = (u² - v²)/(2s), so μ = |a| / g.

So for the first tire, |a| is 9.1875 / 36.2 ≈ 0.2538 m/s². So μ = 0.2538 / 9.8 ≈ 0.0259.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

9.1875 / 36.2. Let's compute 36.2 * 0.25 is 9.05. So 0.25 *36.2 = 9.05. The numerator is 9.1875. So 9.1875 -9.05 = 0.1375 left. 0.1375 / 36.2 is about 0.0038. So total a ≈ 0.25 + 0.0038 = 0.2538.

So a is 0.2538 m/s². Then μ is 0.2538 / 9.8 = approximately 0.0259.

Hmm, wait, that's about 0.0259, which is option D's lower bound? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option D is [0.0259, 0.00505]. Hmm, the lower bound is 0.0259, the upper is 0.00505. Wait, but wait, that would be 0.0259, which is about 2.59% coefficient of friction. Seems high, but maybe possible.

Wait, but let's check the second tire. 105 psi, goes 92.9 m.

u =3.5 m/s, v=1.75 m/s, s=92.9 m.

a = (v² - u²)/(2 s) → (3.0625 - 12.25)/(2 *92.9) → (-9.1875)/(185.8) ≈ -0.0494 m/s².

The magnitude is 0.0494 m/s².

So μ = 0.0494 / 9.8 ≈ 0.00504. So about 0.00504.

Looking at the options, option B is [0.0309, 0.00705]. No, option G is [0.0409, 0.00905]. Option H is [0.0209, 0.00805]. Hmm, wait, 0.00504 is approximately 0.005. But looking at the options, option B's upper is 0.00705. So the second tire's μ is about 0.005, which would fall in option B's upper range?

Wait, no. Let me go back. Oh wait, no. Because option B is [0.0309, 0.00705]. Wait, that can't be, because 0.00504 is smaller than 0.00705. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, let me redo the calculations. For the first tire, a = (1.75^2 - 3.5^2)/(2*18.1) → (3.0625 -12.25) = -9.1875. So a = (-9.1875)/(36.2) = -0.2538 m/s². The magnitude is 0.2538. μ=0.2538/9.8 ≈ 0.0259.

Second tire: a=(1.75² -3.5²)/(2*92.9)= same numerator, so -9.1875/(185.8)= approx -0.0494 m/s². So |a|=0.0494. μ=0.0494/9.8≈0.00504.

So μ for first is approximately 0.0259, which is in the range [0.0209, 0.00805] if I'm looking at the last options, but wait, looking at the options:

Option A: [0.0459, 0.00305]
Option B: [0.0309, 0.00705]
Option C: [0.0109, 0.01005]
Option D: [0.0259, 0.00505]
Option E: [0.0509, 0.00105]
Option F: [0.0359, 0.00405]
Option G: [0.0409, 0.00905]
Option H: [0.0209, 0.00805]
Option I: [0.0559, 0.00205]
Option J: [0.0159, 0.00605]

So the first tire's μ is approximately 0.0259, which is in option D's lower bound (0.0259) and upper (0.00505). Hmm, but 0.0259 is higher than 0.00505. Wait, no, option D's upper is 0.00505, which is lower than 0.0259. So 0.0259 is higher than 0.00505. So that can't be. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong.

Wait, the formula is correct. The coefficient of friction depends on the acceleration, so the higher the μ, the larger the a.

Wait, wait, let's double-check for the first tire.

u=3.5, v=1.75. So (1.75)^2 = 3.0625, (3.5)^2=12.25. So (3.0625 -12.25) = -9.1875. Divided by (2 * 18.1) = 36.2 → a = -9.1875/36.2 ≈-0.2538. So |a|=0.2538.

So μ=0.2538/9.8 ≈ 0.0259. So approx 0.0259.

Looking at the options:

Option D: [0.0259, 0.00505]. So the lower bound is 0.0259, and the upper is 0.00505. But 0.0259 is higher than the upper. So that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate.

Compute a for first tire:

v = 1.75 m/s, u=3.5 m/s, s=18.1 m.

a = (v² - u²)/(2s) → (3.0625 - 12.25)/(2*18.1) → (-9.1875)/(36.2) → approximately -0.2538 m/s².

So |a|=0.2538.

μ = 0.2538 / 9.8 → 0.0259 approximately. So that's 0.0259. Looking at the options, the only option that includes 0.0259 is option D.

Wait, but option D says [0.0259, 0.00505]. So 0.00505 is much lower than 0.0259. So, the second tire, which has a lower μ, so the μ for the first is 0.0259, which is the lower end of option D.

Now, the second tire: u=3.5, v=1.75, s=92.9.

a=(1.75^2 -3.5^2)/(2*92.9) → same numerator, so (3.0625 -12.25)= -9.1875.

Then ( -9.1875 ) / (2 * 92.9) → -9.1875 / 185.8 ≈ -0.0494 m/s². So |a|=0.0494.

μ = 0.0494 /9.8 ≈ 0.00504.

So for the second tire, the μ is approximately 0.00504.

Looking at the options for the second tire, option G is [0.0409, 0.00905], which includes 0.00504. But wait, 0.00504 is way below the upper limit of option G, which is 0.00905. So the second tire's μ is about 0.005, which is in option G's lower bound.

But the first tire's μ is 0.0259, which is in option D's lower bound, but the upper end is 0.00505, which is lower. So no option includes both. But wait, perhaps the options are not mutually exclusive, but the answer requires both to be in the same option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, let's compute a for the first tire.

u=3.5, v=1.75, s=18.1.

v² = 3.0625, u²=12.25, so (v² - u²)= -9.1875.

2s = 36.2. So a = (-9.1875)/36.2 = approximately -0.2538 m/s². So |a|=0.2538.

μ = (0.2538)/(9.8) → 0.2538 ÷ 9.8 ≈ 0.0259.

Yes, that's correct.

For the second tire: a= (1.75² -3.5²)/(2 *92.9) → same as before, so a= -0.0494. |a|=0.0494.

μ=0.0494/9.8≈0.00504.

Now, looking at the options again, I need to see which option has the first μ as 0.0259 and the second as 0.00504.

Looking at the options:

Option D: [0.0259, 0.00505]. So, the lower bound is 0.0259, and the upper is 0.00505. But 0.00505 is greater than 0.00504, so perhaps the upper is 0.00505. So the first tire's μ is in option D's lower bound, but the second isn't in option D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, because 18.1 meters might give a lower μ, but 92.9 meters a higher μ. But the options don't have an option that covers both.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the a for the first tire.

v^2 = (1.75)^2 = 3.0625.

u^2 = (3.5)^2 = 12.25.

v² -u² = 3.0625 -12.25 = -9.1875.

2s= 2 *18.1=36.2.

a= -9.1875 /36.2 → let me compute this.

36.2 * 0.25 = 9.05.

So 9.1875-9.05=0.1375.

So 0.1375/(36.2) = 0.0038.

So 0.25 + 0.0038 = 0.2538 m/s².

So |a|=0.2538.

μ=0.2538/9.8 → 0.0259.

So seems correct.

Now for the second tire:

a = (1.75² -3.5²)/(2*92.9)= same as before, so a= -9.1875/(185.8)= approx -0.0494.

So |a|=0.0494.

μ=0.0494/9.8= 0.00504.

Hmm, but the options don't have an option where the first is 0.0259 and the second is 0.00504. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in reality, the tire with lower friction would have a higher stopping distance, which it does in this case. So the first tire has higher μ, the second lower.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the correct answer must be the option that includes both μ values within it.

Looking again:

Option D: [0.0259, 0.00505].

So the first μ is exactly at 0.0259, the second is 0.00504, which is inside option D's range.

Wait, option D's upper is 0.00505, which is slightly higher than the second tire's μ of 0.00504. So perhaps the answer is option D.

Wait, but the options are:

A. [0.0459,0.00305]

B. [0.0309,0.00705]

C. [0.0109,0.01005]

D. [0.0259,0.00505]

E. [0.0509,0.00105]

F. [0.0359,0.00405]

G. [0.0409,0.00905]

H. [0.0209,0.00805]

I. [0.0559,0.00205]

J. [0.0159,0.00605]

Looking at the second tire's μ of 0.00504.

Which option has 0.00504 as the lower bound? Looking at each option:

Option G: [0.0409,0.00905] → upper is higher than lower.

Option J: [0.0159,0.00605] → lower is 0.0159, upper 0.00605. So doesn't include 0.00504.

Wait, option H: [0.0209,0.00805] → lower is 0.0209, upper 0.00805. Doesn't include 0.00504.

Option F: [0.0359,0.00405] → lower 0.0359, upper 0.00405. Doesn't include 0.00504.

Only option B has a lower bound above 0.0309, but the second tire's μ is 0.00504, which is below 0.0309. So not in option B.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option that includes both μ values. The first tire's μ is 0.0259, the second is 0.00504. So the range for the first is [0.0259, ...], and the second [0.00504, ...].

Looking at the options, perhaps I should see which option covers both μ values. But wait, the options don't have any that cover both, so perhaps I've made an error in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-verify.

In the first case, (v² - u²) is negative, so a is negative. The magnitude is 0.2538 m/s².

μ = 0.2538 /9.8 → 0.0259.

Second case, (v² - u²) is negative, so a is negative. Magnitude 0.0494.

μ=0.0494 /9.8 →0.00504.

So the two μs are 0.0259 and 0.00504.

Looking at the options, none of them include both. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, because it includes the first μ and the second is within the same option. Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute a for the first tire again.

u=3.5, v=1.75, s=18.1.

v² = 3.0625, u²=12.25.

v² - u²= -9.1875.

2s=36.2.

a= -9.1875/36.2 → let's compute 9.1875 /36.2.

36.2 * 0.25 =9.05.

9.1875-9.05=0.1375.

0.1375 /36.2 = 0.0038.

So 0.25 +0.0038=0.2538.

a= -0.2538.

μ=0.2538/9.8=0.0259.

So that's correct.

Now for the second tire:

u=3.5, v=1.75, s=92.9.

v² -u²= -9.1875.

2s=185.8.

a= -9.1875/185.8 → let's compute.

9.1875 /185.8.

Approx 0.0494.

So a= -0.0494.

μ=0.0494/9.8=0.00504.

So, again, correct.

Hmm, but looking at the options, no option includes both. So perhaps I should review the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the a for the first tire again.

u=3.5, v=1.75, s=18.1.

v² = (1.75)^2 → 3.0625.

u²=3.5^2=12.25.

v² -u²=3.0625 -12.25=-9.1875.

2s=36.2.

So a= (-9.1875)/(36.2)= -0.2538.

So |a|=0.2538.

μ=0.2538/9.8=0.0259.

So correct.

Now for the second tire:

Same way, a= -0.0494.

μ=0.00504.

So, looking for an option that includes μ1=0.0259 and μ2=0.00504.

So, the first tire's μ is 0.0259, which is the lower end of option D. The second tire's μ is 0.00504, which is inside option D's upper bound (which is 0.00505). So, perhaps the answer is option D.

Wait, but option D's upper limit is 0.00505, which is just slightly above 0.00504. So perhaps the correct option is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in one of the tires. Let me recompute.

Wait, for the second tire:

a = (1.75^2 -3.5^2)/(2*92.9) → same numerator as before.

So, (3.0625 -12.25)= -9.1875.

Denominator: 2*92.9=185.8.

So, a= -9.1875/185.8.

Let me compute 9.1875 /185.8.

185.8 × 0.0494 = approx 9.1875.

So, a= -0.0494.

So, |a|=0.0494.

μ=0.0494/9.8=0.00504.

So, correct.

So, the two μs are 0.0259 and 0.00504.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes 0.0259 is option D, and the second μ (0.00504) is within the same option.

So, the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but option D's upper limit is 0.00505, which is higher than 0.00504. So, perhaps the intended answer is option D, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formulas. The correct formula for stopping distance is:

s = (v²)/(2a), where a is the deceleration (since the tire is rolling without slipping, the deceleration is due to friction).

Alternatively, considering the force, F = ma = μ mg.

So, ma = μ mg → a = μ g.

So, a = μ g.

So, from the kinematic equations, v² = u² + 2 a s.

Substituting a = μ g, we get:

v² = u² + 2 μ g s.

Rearranged: 2 μ g s = v² - u².

So, μ = (v² - u²)/(2 g s).

Wait, that's a different formula than before. Wait, earlier I used a = (v² - u²)/(2 s), but according to this, a = μ g.

Hmm, perhaps I should use this approach. Let me re-calculate.

Given:

μ = (v² - u²)/(2 g s).

Wait, but then this formula would give μ as (v² - u²)/(2 g s).

Wait, but in my previous approach, I used a = (v² - u²)/(2 s), and then μ = a / g.

Wait, let me rederive.

The normal approach is:

From kinematic equation: v² = u² + 2 a s.

And, from F = ma: a = μ g.

So, substituting a = μ g into the kinematic equation:

v² = u² + 2 (μ g) s.

Rearranged: v² - u² = 2 μ g s.

So, μ = (v² - u²)/(2 g s).

So, this is the correct formula. So, I made a mistake earlier by using a = (v² - u²)/(2 s), which is incorrect. Instead, a should be (v² - u²)/(2 s) only if a is the deceleration. Wait, no, in fact, a is the acceleration (deceleration). So, using a = (v² - u²)/(2 s) is incorrect, because that's the formula for when the initial and final velocities are the same, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should correct this approach.

Wait, in reality, the acceleration a is equal to the deceleration, which is μ g. So, from the kinematic equation:

v² = u² + 2 a s.

And since a = μ g,

v² = u² + 2 (μ g) s.

Rearranged: μ = (v² - u²)/(2 g s).

So, correct formula is μ = (v² - u²)/(2 g s).

So, let's recompute the first tire:

u=3.5 m/s, v=1.75 m/s.

s=18.1 m.

g=9.8 m/s².

v² = 3.0625.

u²=12.25.

v² - u² = -9.1875.

So, μ = (-9.1875)/(2 *9.8 *18.1).

Compute denominator: 2 *9.8 =19.6. 19.6 *18.1 =354.76.

So, μ= -9.1875/354.76.

Approximately -0.0259.

But since μ is positive, it's 0.0259.

So, correct.

Second tire:

u=3.5, v=1.75, s=92.9.

v² -u²= -9.1875.

Denominator: 2 *9.8 *92.9 = 2*9.8=19.6, 19.6 *92.9= 1820. 19.6*92.9=1820. (Let me compute 92.9 *19.6.)

92.9 *19.6 = 92.9 * (20 -0.4) = 92.9 *20 -92.9*0.4 = 1858 -37.16= 1820.84.

So, denominator=1820.84.

μ= (-9.1875)/1820.84 = approximately -0.00504.

So, the μ is 0.00504.

So, again, the two μs are 0.0259 and 0.00504.

Looking for the option where both μs fall into it.

The first μ is 0.0259. The second is 0.00504.

Looking at the options:

Option D: [0.0259, 0.00505].

So, 0.0259 is at the lower bound, and 0.00505 is at the upper bound of the option. Since 0.00504 is less than 0.00505, it's inside option D.

So, the correct answer must be option D.

But wait, let me confirm. Option D's lower bound is 0.0259, upper bound is 0.00505. So, any value between these is included. So, 0.00504 is between 0.0259 and 0.00505? No, because 0.0259 is higher than 0.00505. Oh wait, no.

Wait, 0.0259 is higher than 0.00505. So, the upper limit is 0.00505, which is lower than the lower limit of the option. So, option D's range doesn't include 0.00504.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: [0.0259, 0.00505]. So, it covers from 0.0259 to 0.00505.

So, the values in this range are 0.0259 to 0.00505.

But 0.0259 is higher than 0.00505. So, the range is from 0.0259 to 0.00505, which is impossible because 0.0259 is higher than 0.00505.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the option's description.

Wait, the option D is written as [0.0259, 0.00505]. So, perhaps the lower bound is 0.0259, and the upper bound is 0.00505. So, it's a range from 0.0259 to 0.00505, which is not possible because 0.0259 is greater than 0.00505.

Hence, the option D is invalid.

So, I'm back to the original conclusion: the correct answer is option D, but with the understanding that perhaps I made a mistake in the option's description.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an option where the two μs are covered.

Wait, let me think again.

The correct μ1 is 0.0259 and μ2 is 0.00504.

Looking for an option where both μs are included.

Looking at the options, none of them include both. So, perhaps I should look for the option that includes the lower μ but excludes the higher one, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should check all the options again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should look for the option where the lower μ is included.

Looking at the options:

Option D: lower bound 0.0259, upper bound 0.00505.

So, it includes μ1=0.0259 and μ2=0.00504.

Because 0.00504 is less than 0.00505.

So, μ2 is within option D.

But let's check the upper limit of option D: 0.00505 is higher than μ2=0.00504. So, yes, it's within.

So, the correct answer is option D.

But I'm a bit confused because the option's description seems contradictory. So, perhaps, the intended answer is option D.

So, the answer is D.

Wait, but the user might have a problem because option D's upper limit is 0.00505, which is higher than μ2=0.00504, so it's included. So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm still a bit confused because the option's description seems to have an error.

But given the calculations, the correct answer is option D.
</think>

The correct answer is **D**.

**Explanation:**

Using the formula for stopping distance:

\[
\mu = \frac{v^2 - u^2}{2 g s}
\]

### For the first tire:

- \(u = 3.5 \, \text{m/s}\), \(v = 1.75 \, \text{m/s}\), \(s = 18.1 \, \text{m}\)
- \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\)

\[
\mu = \frac{(1.75)^2 - (3.5)^2}{2 \times 9.8 \times 18.1} = \frac{-9.1875}{354.76} \approx -0.0259
\]

Since \(\mu\) is positive, it is \(0.0259\).

### For the second tire:

- \(u = 3.5 \, \text{m/s}\), \(v = 1.75 \, \text{m/s}\), \(s = 92.9 \, \text{m}\)
- \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\)

\[
\mu = \frac{(1.75)^2 - (3.5)^2}{2 \times 9.8 \times 92.9} = \frac{-9.1875}{1820.84} \approx -0.00504
\]

Since \(\mu\) is positive, it is \(0.00504\).

### Comparing with the options:

The correct values of \(\mu\) are \(0.0259\) and \(0.00504\). The only option that includes both values is **D**.
