Okay, so I have this question here about homomorphic images of cyclic and Abelian groups. Hmm, I remember homomorphic images are like the images of a group under a homomorphism, right? So the question is about whether certain statements are true or false.

Let me start with Statement 1: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic. Wait, what's a cyclic group again? Oh right, a cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element. So if I have a cyclic group G and a homomorphism f from G to another group H, then the image f(G) should also be cyclic.

Wait, but is that always true? I think so. Because the image is the set of all f(g) where g is in G. Since G is generated by a single element, say a, then f(a) generates f(G). So f(G) is cyclic. Yeah, so Statement 1 should be true.

Now Statement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian. Abelian means that for any two elements a and b in the group, ab = ba. So if H is the image of G under a homomorphism f, then for any h1, h2 in H, which are f(g1) and f(g2) for some g1, g2 in G. Then h1h2 = f(g1)f(g2) = f(g1g2) because homomorphism preserves the operation. Since G is Abelian, g1g2 = g2g1, so f(g1g2) = f(g2g1) = f(g2)f(g1). So h1h2 = h2h1. That makes H Abelian. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, wait. Are there any exceptions? Like, could the homomorphism not be surjective? Because if the image is a subset of H, then even if H is Abelian, the image could be a subgroup. Subgroups of Abelian groups are Abelian, so that's fine. So both statements should be true.

The statements are both true. 

**Answer: D: True, True**
