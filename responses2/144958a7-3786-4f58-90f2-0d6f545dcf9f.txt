Okay, so I have this question here: "Change 34 L 18 cL to liters." Hmm... I'm a bit confused about the units here. Let me think. I remember that 'cL' stands for centiliters. So, I need to convert that to liters. 

Wait, right, I think 1 liter is 100 centiliters because 'c' is the prefix for centi, which is 10^-2. So, 1 cL is 0.01 liters. So, if I have 18 cL, that would be 18 * 0.01 liters, which is 0.18 liters. 

Now, adding that to 34 liters. So, 34 L plus 0.18 L equals 34.18 liters. Let me look at the options. Option I is 34.18 L, which matches what I got. 

Oh wait, but I should check if any other options make sense. Option B is 34.018, which is 34.018 L. Did I do the calculation right? Wait, no, because 18 cL is 0.18, so adding 34 gives 34.18. So Option I is correct.
