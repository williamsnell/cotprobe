Question:

Long was a purchasing agent for Frost, a sole proprietor. Long had express authority to place purchase orders with Frost's suppliers. Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?

Options:

A: No, because Grant should have verified Frost's competency.
B: No, because the law protects those declared incompetent from contractual obligations.
C: Yes, because the contract was conducted online.
D: No, because Grant dealt only with Long.
E: Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.
F: No, because Frost's incompetence voided the agency relationship.
G: No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.
H: Yes, because Long had express authority to place orders.
I: Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.
J: Yes, because the order was placed before Frost was declared incompetent.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about contract law, specifically about whether Frost's legal representative can be liable for Grant's contract. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The scenario is that Long, who's a purchasing agent for Frost, a sole proprietor, had express authority to place purchase orders. So express authority usually means that the agent has the right to make orders without consulting a lawyer, right? And Long was doing business online, not directly dealing with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant didn't know about Frost's incompetence.

The question is whether either Frost or her legal rep would be liable for Grant's contract. Hmm. Let's think about the law here.

Contract law usually deals with whether a contract was formed and whether the parties are liable. Express authority is a key concept here. Express authority allows the agent to make orders without legal representation, so Long can act as a dummy in this case. 

Now, the big issue is whether Frost's incompetence affects the contract. Frost's incompetence led to her being declared incompetent, and Long was still acting as the agent. So here's the thing: if the contract was formed without Frost's knowledge, then perhaps the contract stands even if Frost is out. But wait, Frost was declared incompetent, which might have created an obligation for her to follow through. So maybe the contract is voidable if Frost is incompetent.

But wait, the question is about liability after Frost was declared incompetent. So Long placed the order on Frost's behalf. Since Long had express authority, maybe the contract can still be valid. Or does the fact that Long was acting on Frost's behalf and not in her own capacity affect anything?

Alternatively, if Frost's incompetence was a contract term, then maybe the contract is voidable. But in this case, Long placed the order on Frost's behalf. So if Frost's failure to perform was a breach, but she wasn't involved in the contract. Alternatively, if Long was acting on Frost's behalf, maybe the contract is still valid because it was formed in good faith.

Wait, but the problem states that Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. So Frost didn't know about it, and neither did Grant. So maybe the contract wasn't based on Frost's competence.

So the key here is whether the contract's terms were affected by Frost's failure. If the contract was based on Frost's capacity, then her incompetence wouldn't affect it. But if Frost's incompetence was part of the contract, then she might be liable.

Wait, but in this case, the contract was formed by Long acting on Frost's behalf. So Frost didn't enter into any contract herself. Grant was dealing with Long, not Frost. So Frost's incompetence wasn't part of the contractâ€”she wasn't involved in the contract terms.

So if the contract was formed without her involvement, then her incompetence wouldn't affect the contract. Therefore, Grant would not be liable because Frost wasn't part of the contract. So the answer might be D: No, because Grant dealt only with Long.

Alternatively, maybe the express authority applies regardless of Frost's incompetence. Long can still place orders as an agent. So even if Frost wasn't competent, the order was valid. Therefore, the answer might be H: Yes, because Long had express authority to place orders.

Wait, but the question is about whether either Frost's legal rep or Frost themselves are liable. If the contract was formed through Long's authority, then Long is liable. Because both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence, but the contract was formed via Long's action, which is an express authority. So Long is the one who should be liable because they had authority to place orders.

So looking at the options, H says "Yes, because the contract was conducted online." Hmm, but that's not a good reason. The reason should be about the express authority.

Option I says "Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence." That seems correct because the express authority gives Long the authority to act on Frost, regardless of her incompetence. So Grant's contract wouldn't be void or subject to any liability because the contract was formed via Long's authority. So the answer would be I: Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.

Alternatively, another angle: If Frost wasn't involved in the contract, then her incompetence wouldn't affect it. So Grant is only dealing with Long. So the liability would be on Long. Hence, H or I.

Wait, but the question is about whether either Frost's legal representative or Frost themselves are liable. If Long had authority, then Long is liable. Because Long didn't have to consult Frost; they were acting on her behalf. So Grant is an agent, but Long is the one who made the orders. So since Long is the one who had the authority, the answer would be I: Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence. Because even though Frost was incompetent, Long's authority to place orders was express, making the contract valid and Long liable.

So looking at the options, option I says "Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence." That makes sense. Because the express authority allows Long to act on Frost without any legal representation, and Frost's incompetence didn't affect the contract. Therefore, Long is liable.

The contract was formed through Long's express authority to place purchase orders, which allowed her to act on Frost without legal representation. Frost's incompetence did not impact the contract's validity or liability because the authority was express and independent of Frost's status. Long's express authority makes her liable, as she had the authority to make the orders. 

Answer: I: Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.
