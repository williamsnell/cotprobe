Okay, so I've got this question about the larynx and the nerves innervating it. Hmm, let me think. The larynx has different parts, and each part is innervated by different nerves. I remember that the larynx is divided into three main sections: the upper, middle, and lower larynx. 

The question is specifically about the upper larynx. I think the upper part is smaller and located above the middle larynx. Now, what parts of the nervous system innervate the upper larynx? I recall that the upper larynx is innervated by the internal laryngeal nerve. That nerve is part of the internal nervous system, which I believe is the lower section of the nervous system. 

Wait, what about the options? Let's look at the choices. Option B says internal laryngeal nerve which is the afferent limb of the gag reflex. Option E is superior laryngeal which is cough reflex. Option J is the same as E but for the cough. Option A is about the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which I think is the afferent part of the cough reflex. Option C is the vagus nerve, which I don't think is the primary innervation of the upper larynx. 

I think the internal laryngeal nerve is the one that's innervating the upper larynx. The upper larynx receives signals from the internal nerve, which is part of the afferent path to the voice box through the laryngeal reflex. So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is **B: internal laryngeal nerve which is the afferent limb of the gag reflex**.
