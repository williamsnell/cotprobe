Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about cemeteries. The question is asking what's called a burial site where the body is allowed to decompose naturally without a casket. The options are A to J, each with different terms.

First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A is "Eco-friendly." Hmm, I think that's more about being environmentally friendly, like recycling. It doesn't directly relate to the decomposition of a body.

Option B is "Sunshine." That doesn't sound familiar. Maybe it's a typo for "Sunrise"? Not sure, but I don't think it's related to cemeteries.

Option C is "Forest." That's a place where trees grow. But a forest is a natural area with living organisms, not necessarily a casket for decomposition. So probably not this.

Option D is "Rapid decay." I've heard that term used in relation to decomposing organic matter. Like, the rate at which organic matter breaks down. So maybe a site where this process is rapid.

Option E is "Organic." That makes sense because organic refers to living things, and decomposition is a natural process involving living organisms.

Option F is "Environmental." That's a broader term, not specific to decomposition.

Option G is "Naturalistic." I'm not familiar with that term. It might be a less common or incorrect option.

Option H is "Biodegradable." This sounds like a term used in the context of materials that can break down naturally, like food. But the question is about a body, not a material.

Option I is "Wild." That's more about the natural environment, not a specific term for decomposition.

Option J is "Green." That's about the environment being green, not about decomposition.

Wait, I think I remember something about "biodegradable" being a term used in contexts where organic matter is broken down quickly. So a site where bodies decompose naturally without a casket might be called a biodegradable cemetery. But looking at the options, option H is "Biodegradable," which fits. Alternatively, decomposition without a casket could be referred to as "naturalistic" but I'm not sure. 

Wait, the question is about a site where the body is allowed to decompose naturally without a casket. So it's about the decomposition process, not the casket itself. The term "naturalistic" isn't one of the options, except option G, which I don't think applies. 

Another thought: "Biodegradable" is a term that describes substances like food or organic waste that break down easily. So a cemetery where bodies decompose quickly without a casket might be called a biodegradable cemetery. But the options don't have that term. Oh wait, looking back, option H is "Biodegradable," which is an adjective describing the decomposition process. 

Wait, but the options don't have a term for a casket. The question is about the body decomposition. So options E, H, Jâ€”wait, J is "Green." No, that's about the environment, not the decomposition.

So the options are A to J. The correct term for a site where bodies decompose naturally without a casket is "biodegradable." But wait, the options don't have an option for biodegradable. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option H is "Biodegradable." So the correct answer should be H. But wait, another thought. The options include "biodegradable" as H, but also "Organic," which is another term. Wait, the question is about a body decomposition, so it's about the process. So the term would be "biodegradable." 

But wait, another possibility: "Organic" (option E) could be another term. Because organic refers to living things and their decomposition. So a site where bodies decompose naturally without a casket might be called an "organic cemetery." But that's not one of the options. The options are limited.

Wait, the options are A to J. So the options are:

A: Eco-friendly
B: Sunshine
C: Forest
D: Rapid decay
E: Organic
F: Environmental
G: Naturalistic
H: Biodegradable
I: Wild
J: Green

So the correct term is "biodegradable" (H) as the decomposition is natural. So the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: Biodegradable. The question asks for a cemetery where bodies decompose naturally without a casket, which refers to the natural decomposition process. "Biodegradable" is the term that describes this process, making option H the correct choice.

Answer: H
