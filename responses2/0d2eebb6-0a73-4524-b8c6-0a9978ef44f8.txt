Question:

Plaid Pants, Inc. common stock has a beta of 0.90, while Acme Dynamite Company common stock has a beta of 1.80. The expected return on the market is 10 percent, and the risk-free rate is 6 percent. According to the capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) and making use of the information above, the required return on Plaid Pants' common stock should be , and the required return on Acme's common stock should be .

Okay, I've got this CAPM question here. I'm a bit new to this, so let me think it through step by step. So, the question is about calculating the required returns for two stocks using the CAPM model. The data given is that Plaid Pants has a beta of 0.90, Acme has a beta of 1.80. The expected market return is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 6%. Let me remember what I know about CAPM.

CAPM stands for Capital Asset Pricing Model. The formula for required return is: Required Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). Yeah, that's it. So each stock's required return depends on their beta and the market-related components.

First, I'll calculate Plaid Pants' required return. Their beta is 0.90. So, plugging into the formula:

Required Return = 6% + 0.90 * (10% - 6%)

Wait, wait, let me compute that. The market return minus the risk-free rate is 10% - 6% = 4%. Multiply that by beta: 0.90 * 4% = 3.6%. So adding that to the risk-free rate: 6% + 3.6% = 9.6%. So Plaid Pants' required return is 9.6%.

Now, for Acme's stock, beta is 1.80. So applying the same formula:

Required Return = 6% + 1.80 * (10% - 6%)

Again, 10% -6% is 4%, so 1.80 *4% =7.2%. Adding to risk-free: 6% +7.2% =13.2%. So Acme's required return is 13.2%.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. The first number for Plaid Pants is 9.6%, and for Acme, 13.2%. Let me check the options:

Option B says 9.6% and 13.2%. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the required returns for Plaid Pants' and Acme's common stocks using the CAPM formula, we apply the following steps:

**Plaid Pants' Required Return:**
- Beta (β) = 0.90
- Market Return (Rm) = 10%
- Risk-Free Rate (Rf) = 6%
- CAPM Formula: Required Return = Rf + β*(Rm - Rf)
- Calculation: 6% + 0.90*(10% - 6%) = 6% + 3.6% = 9.6%

**Acme's Required Return:**
- Beta (β) = 1.80
- Market Return (Rm) = 10%
- Risk-Free Rate (Rf) = 6%
- CAPM Formula: Required Return = Rf + β*(Rm - Rf)
- Calculation: 6% + 1.80*(10% - 6%) = 6% + 7.2% = 13.2%

**Matching the Results:**
- Plaid Pants: 9.6%
- Acme: 13.2%
- **Option B** (9.6%, 13.2%) is the correct match.

ANSWER: B
