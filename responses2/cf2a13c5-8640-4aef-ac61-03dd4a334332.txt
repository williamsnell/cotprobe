Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about hominid evolution based on fossil evidence. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question asks: The fossil evidence indicates that by 1.8 million years ago, a new hominid known as _______ had evolved. The options are A through H, with various names like Australopithecus afarensis, Homo naledi, etc.

Hmm, I remember that in the evolution of hominids, there were several notable findings. The first major group was the Australopithecus, who lived around 1.8 million years ago. They were a group of primates, so that makes sense because the question is about a hominid.

Wait, but I think the Australopithecus was split into two lineages around that time. One was Homo erectus, which lived around 1.5 million years ago. The other lineage became Homo naledi, which is older, around 1.5 million years ago too, but maybe they died off around 1.8 million. So that makes sense because the split happened, and the line that died off was the older one, which was Homo naledi.

So the question is about a new hominid, which is a term used for a new species. So looking at the options, option B is Homo naledi, which is the one that died off around 1.8 million years ago. The others are either extinct species or belong to different groups.

Wait, but the question is about a new hominid. So the correct answer should be the one that's a new species, which is Homo naledi (option B) because the other options either are extinct or belong to different lineages.

Options like option E is Homo floresiensis, which I think is a species of rhesus monkey, not a hominid. Option F is Homo sapiens, which is modern humans. Option G is Homo heidelbergensis, another rhesus. Option H is Homo erectus, which lived a bit earlier than 1.8 million years ago, so that's an older species.

The question is about a hominid, so the correct answer would be either B or E, F, G, H. But E and F are rhesus, not hominids. So B is the only one that is a hominid and fits the criteria of being a new species. So the answer must be B.

The fossil evidence indicates that by 1.8 million years ago, a new hominid known as **Homo naledi** had evolved. This species is a modern rhesus monkey and represents a new species within the hominid lineage. The other options do not fit the criteria of being a hominid or not representing a new species. 

Answer: B
