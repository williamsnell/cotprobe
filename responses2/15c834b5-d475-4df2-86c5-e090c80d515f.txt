Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So the question is about the difference in insurance premiums for a frame house depending on the class of the town. Hmm. I remember that class of the town affects the insurance rates. 

Wait, I think in some states, frame houses (which are single-family homes) have different insurance requirements based on where they are located. Class A might be more expensive, and Class B less so. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact difference.

I think in general, in the U.S., if I recall correctly, frame houses in Class A towns have higher insurance premiums than those in Class B. So if a frame house is in Class A, it might cost more than the same house in a Class B town. 

But how much more? The options given are various amounts between $3 and $10. I'm trying to think about the exact rates. I remember that in some states, the difference can be around $15-20, but wait, maybe that's for different types of buildings or different classes entirely. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's the same for frame houses in all classes, but that doesn't make much sense because the question is comparing two different towns. So the difference depends on the class of the town.

Wait, I think in some places, frame houses in Class A have higher coverage than those in Class B. Let me try to think about the exact numbers. Oh, I remember now that in some states, frame houses in Class A might cost up to $15 higher than in Class B. But wait, the options don't have $15 as an option. The closest is option C at $15.00. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. 

Wait, another thought: maybe the difference is $10 or $12, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the difference is $7.20, which is option D. 

Wait, I think I might have read somewhere that frame houses in Class A can cost up to $15 more than those in Class B. But the options don't have that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a different amount. Or perhaps the question is about the difference per square foot or something else. 

Wait, another angle: maybe the question is about the cost per unit, but no, it's about the total difference. Oh, wait! I think the difference is $12.50. Because in some states, frame houses in Class A might cost an extra $12.50 over Class B. Or is it $15? I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is $7.20. Oh, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Maybe I should recall that for frame houses, the difference in Class A and B is about $10-12.50. So maybe the options have $12.50, which is option G. 

Wait, another thought: I think in some states, frame houses in Class A are more expensive. Let me think about the exact rate for Class A and Class B. I remember that in some places, the difference is up to $15, but perhaps it's $12.50. Alternatively, maybe it's $7.20.

Wait, I've heard that in some states, frame houses in Class A are more expensive, but the exact difference is not clear to me. Alternatively, perhaps the difference is $10.70, which is option E.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the standard difference is. If the answer options include $12.50, that's option G. Alternatively, maybe it's $10.70, which is E. Alternatively, maybe it's $7.20, which is D.

Wait, I think I remember that for frame houses, the difference between Class A and B could be around $12.50. So the correct answer would be G: $12.50.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the difference is $10.70, which is E. I'm a bit stuck. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the question again. The question is about two different towns: one in Class A and the same house in Class B. So the difference is based on the class, not the location (town). So the answer is the difference between the two classes. So the options are the possible differences between the two classes.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: perhaps the difference is $12.50, so option G. Alternatively, maybe it's $10.70, which is E. Alternatively, perhaps the difference is $7.20, which is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is around $10, so E is $10.70. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, I think I've read that the difference between Class A and B for frame houses can be up to $10.70, so maybe E is the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is $7.20, which is D. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual figure. I think that in some states, frame houses in Class A are up to $15 higher than Class B. But the options don't have $15. So perhaps the correct option is $12.50, which is G. Alternatively, I think the correct answer is $12.50, which is G. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the difference as $10.70. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should proceed with the thought that the difference is $12.50, which is option G.
