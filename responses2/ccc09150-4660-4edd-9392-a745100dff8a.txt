Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the impact of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on school desegregation in the South. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to remember what the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was about. From what I recall, it was a law passed in the United States, specifically targeting the South, which had a lot of segregation in schools. The main goal was to enforce the "separate but equal" doctrine that had been enforced by segregation in higher education. The idea was that since schools didn't have the right to discriminate against students of different races, they should enforce it.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that accurately describes the impact. Let's go through each option.

Option A: The Act mandated a quota system for racial representation in schools. Hmm, the Act wasn't about quotas. It was more about enforcing the "separate but equal" doctrine, not about the distribution of students by race. So I think A is not correct.

Option B: It immediately desegregated all schools in the South. No, that doesn't sound right. The desegregation happened gradually over time, not immediately. The Act was a mandate to enforce it, but it wasn't a complete desegregation. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: No effect because there were no enforcement provisions. Wait, the Act did include an enforcement provision. It mentioned that schools should enforce the "separate but equal" doctrine. So without an enforcement clause, the Act might not have done much. But the wording is a bit tricky. The actual enforcement was in the form of federal troops, so maybe the "no appreciable effect" part is accurate. But I'm not sure if the answer expects that to be the case, or if it's implying that without enforcement, no effect. So I need to be careful here.

Option D: Legal to segregate schools but no enforcement. No, that's the opposite. The Act was meant to prevent schools from segregating. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Only in universities. That doesn't make sense. The Act was broader and applied to all public schools, not just universities. So E is wrong.

Option F: overturn "separate but equal." Yes, that's a key point. The Act redefined the "separate but equal" doctrine as a legal obligation for schools to enforce. So this option correctly states that the Act ended the segregation in schools, thus option F is correct.

Option G: Increased segregation. That doesn't align with the Act. The Act was meant to stop segregation, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Sent troops to schools. The Act didn't say that. The intent was to enforce, not enforce by sending troops. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Speeded desegregation by cutting off funds. No, the Act was more about enforcement than cutting funds. So I is wrong.

Option J: No impact, but provided basis. Well, the Act definitely impacted desegregation, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is F: By overturning the "separate but equal" principle, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended segregation in public schools.
