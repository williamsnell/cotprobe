Question:

This question refers to the following information.
While some theorists in the Middle Ages argued that the jihad was a defensive warâ€¦ most authorities held that the obligation of jihad did not lapse until all the world was brought under the sway of Islam. The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or "Sea of Precious Virtues," written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.
Robert Irwin, "Islam and the Crusades," 1995
It is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.
Ibn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185
The second passage undermines traditional historical assumptions by

Options:

A: showing that state-level antagonisms in the Middle East during the crusading era were not always reflected in personal or economic life.
B: showing how Middle Eastern Muslims during the crusading era did not take religious obligations as seriously as Christians did.
C: showing how Muslims were on the whole kinder than Christians in the Middle East during the crusading era.
D: showing how, in the Middle East during the crusading era, economic factors trumped all other considerations.

Alright, let's tackle this question. Okay, so I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the second passage and how it undermines traditional historical assumptions. The options are A, B, C, D. The passage is about how Christians treated Muslim hermits by giving them food and kindness, which seems contradictory to traditional views.

First, I need to understand the context. The first passage talks about some medieval theorists arguing that jihad was a defensive war, and most authorities believed it didn't lapse until Islam was widespread. Then the second passage discusses a scholar, Ibn Jubayr, who was a Muslim, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem around 1185. It says that when they visited Muslim hermits, they offered them food and treated them kindly, implying that Muslims were more kind. 

So the question is about how this undermines traditional assumptions. Traditional assumptions would probably be that Muslims and Christians treated things similarly. So if in reality, they treated them differently (kindness and food), that would change that assumption.

Looking at the options:

A: states that state-level antagonisms in the Middle East during Crusading times weren't reflected in personal or economic life. Hmm, that might be a stretch. The question is about the impact on how they treated hermits, not necessarily state-level issues.

B: It says that Muslims didn't take religious obligations seriously compared to Christians. I think the second passage is saying that Muslims treated them kindly and offered food, while Christians might have treated them differently, perhaps as enemies. So this seems to directly compare the two groups' treatment, which would challenge traditional assumptions.

C: Talks about kindliness, but it says Muslims were kinder in general. The passage specifically mentions hermits, but it's not clear if it's about all Muslims or just some. The second passage specifically says "not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories." So maybe it's implying that the treatment of Muslims was different, but it doesn't mention that all Muslims were kinder. So maybe C is not directly addressing the comparison.

D: Suggests that economic factors decide things. The passage doesn't say anything about that. It's more about kindness and treatment. So D seems off.

So the key point is that the second passage shows that the way Muslims treated hermits was different from how Christians treated them. So in terms of traditional assumptions, it's pointing out that Muslims didn't take religious obligations seriously. That would mean traditional views that treated both groups similarly were incorrect.

Alternatively, the first part about the jihad and scholars is more about the role of leaders, but the second passage is specifically about the hermits. So the question is about how that undermines assumptions.

So the answer should be B. It shows that Muslims treated hermits differently than Christians, contradicting traditional views.
</think>

The question examines how the second passage undermines traditional historical assumptions by highlighting differences in treatment between Muslims and Christians. The scholar Ibn Jubayr, visiting Muslim territories, treated hermits kindly and offered food, implying a different approach than what was traditionally assumed. This directly challenges the idea that both groups treated religious obligations similarly, making option B the correct answer.

Answer: B
