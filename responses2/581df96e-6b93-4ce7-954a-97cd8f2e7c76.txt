Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm. It's about electromagnetic induction, I think. The question says there's a single turn loop in air with a uniform magnetic field normal to its plane. The area of the loop is 5 square meters. The rate of change of flux density is given as 2 webers per meter squared per second. I need to find the emf that's appearing at the terminals of the loop.

Wait, right, Faraday's Law of Induction comes into play here. Faraday's Law states that the induced electromotive force (emf) in a loop is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. The formula is emf = -dΦ/dt. Oh but wait, the value of the emf is the magnitude, so I probably just need to take the absolute value for this problem.

Magnetic flux Φ is given by Φ = B * A * cos(theta), where B is the magnetic field, A is the area, and theta is the angle between the field and the normal to the loop. Oh, but in this problem, it's stated that the magnetic field is uniform and normal to the plane of the loop. So the angle theta is zero, meaning cos(theta) is 1. So Φ simplifies to just B * A.

But wait, the problem says the rate of change of flux density is 2 webers per meter squared per second. Oh, flux density is magnetic flux density, which is the same as B, I believe. So dΦ/dt is 2 Wb/m²·s, since flux is in Wb (Webers) and the rate of change is per second (s^-1).

So putting it all together, Φ = B*A. The derivative dΦ/dt = A * dB/dt. Because A is a constant (the area of the loop), the derivative of Φ with respect to time is A times the rate of change of B.

So given A is 5 m², and dΦ/dt is 2 Wb/s. So plugging in: Φ' = 5 * 2 = 10 Wb/s. Wait, but wait, the formula says emf is -dΦ/dt. So the emf would be -10 V, but since we're asked for the magnitude, it's 10 volts.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. The rate of change of flux density is given as 2 Wb/m²/s, which is 2 Wb/(m²·s). So dΦ/dt = A * dB/dt. Since A is 5 m², then 5 m² * 2 Wb/(m² s) = 10 Wb/s. So the rate of change of flux is 10 Wb/s. 

Faraday's Law says emf = -dΦ/dt, so the emf is -10 V. But the question asks for the magnitude of the emf, so it's 10 volts. Looking at the options, option B is 10 volts. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait again. Did I get the formula correctly? Oh yes, Faraday's Law is correct. The negative sign from the law indicates the direction of the induced emf, but the problem doesn't ask about direction, just the value. So yeah, 10 volts is the right answer.

To determine the induced electromotive force (emf) in the loop, we use Faraday's Law of Induction, which states:

\[
\text{emf} = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}
\]

Here, \(\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\) is the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. The magnetic flux \(\Phi\) is given by:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]

Since the magnetic field \(B\) is uniform and normal to the plane of the loop, \(\theta = 0^\circ\), and \(\cos(0^\circ) = 1\). Thus:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A
\]

Taking the time derivative:

\[
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = A \cdot \frac{dB}{dt}
\]

The problem states that the rate of change of flux density (i.e., \(\frac{dB}{dt}\)) is \(2 \, \text{Wb/m}^2/\text{s}\). Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = 5 \, \text{m}^2 \cdot 2 \, \text{Wb/m}^2/\text{s} = 10 \, \text{Wb/s}
\]

The induced emf is the negative of this rate of change:

\[
\text{emf} = -10 \, \text{V}
\]

Since the problem asks for the magnitude of the emf, the answer is:

\[
\text{emf} = 10 \, \text{volts}
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:
