Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tax problem from Centerville. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question says the tax rate is 11 and a half percent. Wait, 11.5% is the same as 23/200, right? Because 11% is 11/100, so 11.5% is 23/200. Or maybe it's easier to just convert it to a decimal. Let me check: 11.5% is 0.115 in decimal form.

So, a tax of $1,794 was paid. Hmm, the tax amount is based on the assessed value. The assessment rate is 30%, which I think means that the assessed value is 30% of the market value. Oh wait, noâ€”wait, the assessment rate is the percentage used to determine the assessed value. So if the market value is, say, $100,000, the assessed value would be 30% of that, which is $30,000. Then, the tax is calculated on that assessed value.

Wait, let me make sure I get the terms right. The tax rate is applied to the assessed value, which is a percentage of the market value. So for example, if the market value is V, the assessed value is 30% of V, so 0.3 * V. Then, the tax is 11.5% of the assessed value.

So, the formula should be: Tax = (Assessed Value) * (Tax Rate)

And Assessed Value = (Market Value) * (Assessment Rate)

So putting it together: Tax = (Market Value * Assessment Rate) * Tax Rate

The tax paid is $1,794, so:

1794 = V * 0.30 * 0.115

Wait, let's compute that. 0.3 * 0.115 is 0.0345. So:

1794 = V * 0.0345

To find V, divide both sides by 0.0345.

V = 1794 / 0.0345

Let me calculate that. 1794 divided by 0.0345.

Hmm, 0.0345 is approximately 3.45%. So 1794 divided by 3.45% is the same as 1794 divided by 0.0345.

Let me compute it:

0.0345 is 345 per 1000. So, 1794 divided by 0.0345.

Well, 0.0345 * 52,000 = let me check:

0.0345 * 50,000 = 1725.

0.0345 * 2,000 = 69.

So 1725 + 69 = 1794. Oh wait, that's exactly the tax amount. So V is 52,000.

Looking at the options: option I is $52,000.

Wait, the options are:

A: 60,000

B:43,200

C:1,794

D:25,000

E:30,000

F:39,780

G:48,000

H:15,600

I:52,000

J:21,000

So the answer is I, 52,000.

The expected market value of the property is determined by reversing the tax calculation. Using the formula:

\( \text{Tax} = \text{Market Value} \times \text{Assessment Rate} \times \text{Tax Rate} \)

Given:
- Tax = $1,794
- Assessment Rate = 30% (0.3)
- Tax Rate = 11.5% (0.115)

Rearranging for Market Value:

\( \text{Market Value} = \frac{\text{Tax}}{\text{Assess Rate} \times \text{Tax Rate}} = \frac{1794}{0.3 \times 0.115} = \frac{1794}{0.0345} = 52,000 \)

The correct answer is:

**I: $52,000**
