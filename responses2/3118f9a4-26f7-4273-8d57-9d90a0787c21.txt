Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Ben rolls four fair 20-sided dice, each numbered from 1 to 20. I need to find the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number. The options are labeled from A to J, so I'll have to compute the probability and match it to one of those options.

Hmm, okay. So, each die has 20 sides, so each die has numbers 1 through 20. I know that on a fair die, half of the numbers are even and half are odd. Wait, but 20 is an even number, so that makes sense. So for each die, the probability of rolling an even number is 10/20, which simplifies to 1/2. The same applies to odd.

The problem is about rolling exactly two evens out of four dice. This sounds like a binomial probability problem because each roll is independent, and we have a fixed number of trials (four dice), each with two possible outcomes (even or odd), and we want exactly a certain number of successes (two evens).

The binomial probability formula is:

P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Where:
- P(k) is the probability of k successes,
- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time,
- p is the probability of success on a single trial,
- n is the number of trials.

In this case, n is 4, k is 2, p is 1/2.

So first, I'll compute C(4, 2). C(n, k) is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!). So 4! is 24, 2! is 2, and (4-2)! is also 2!. So 24/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6.

So C(4,2) is 6.

Next, p^k is (1/2)^2, which is 1/4.

Then, (1-p)^(n-k) is (1/2)^(4-2) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Putting it all together: P(2) = 6 * (1/4) * (1/4) = 6 * (1/16) = 6/16.

Simplifying 6/16 gives 3/8.

Looking at the options, option B is 3/8. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

Each die has a 1/2 chance of even. Four dice rolled, want exactly two evens. So yes, binomial distribution applies here.

C(4,2) is 6, correct. (1/2)^2 is 1/4, and (1/2)^2 is also 1/4. Multiply them: 6 * 1/4 * 1/4 = 6/16 = 3/8. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, could I think of it as each die has two possible outcomes: even or odd. For two dice to be even, and the other two to be odd. The number of ways is 4 choose 2, which is 6. Each specific outcome (like die 1 and 2 even, die 3 and 4 odd) has a probability of (1/2)^4 = 1/16. Multiply 6 by 1/16 gives 3/8.

Yes, that's the same result. So I'm confident the answer is 3/8, which is option B.

The probability of rolling exactly two even numbers when rolling four 20-sided dice can be determined using the binomial probability formula. Each die has a 1/2 chance of being even, and we're looking for exactly two successes (evens) out of four trials. The calculation is:

P(2) = C(4,2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6 * (1/4) * (1/4) = 6/16 = 3/8.
