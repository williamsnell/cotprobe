Okay, so I've got this finance math problem here, and I need to find the sale price and the finance charge for a bedroom set. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

First, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The bedroom set has a list price of $1010. It was advertised with a $35 reduction, so I think that means the original price is $1010, and you can save $35, so the sale price would be the original minus the discount. That makes sense because sometimes they offer discounts on furniture, so the sale price is lower than the list price.

Wait, so the first thing I need to do is calculate the sale price after the $35 reduction. Let me do that. Original price is $1010. Subtract $35 from that. Hmm, 1010 minus 35. Let's see, 1010 minus 30 is 980, so minus 5 more would be 975. Oh wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, 1010 minus 35. Let me compute it properly. 1010 minus 35 is 975. So the sale price is $975. Is that right?

Wait, but the options include various sale prices. Let me look at the options again. Looking at the options, options G and H mention a sale price of $850. So I need to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me double-check. The list price is $1010, and the reduction is $35. So $1010 minus $35 is indeed $975. So the sale price should be $975. Hmm, but looking at the options, option G and H have $850 as the sale price. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Or perhaps the $35 is part of a discount structure, not a simple reduction. Hmm, the wording says "a $35 reduction." So I think that's correct. So the sale price is $975. So any option that says sale price $975 would be correct. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is $850, and option H is $850. Option G is sale price $850, but according to my calculation, it should be $975. So maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the $35 reduction is part of the installment plan, not the discount. Let me read the question again: "A bedroom set with a list price of $1010 was advertised for sale at a $35 reduction." So it's a straightforward $35 discount. So the sale price without considering the installment plan would be $975. 

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Let me check the sale prices. The options are:

A: 1122.58
B: 1010
C: 975
D:1085
E:975
F:1122.58
G:850
H:850
I:975
J:1010

So options C, E, and I have sale price $975. So the sale price is $975, so the correct options would be C, E, or I. Now, let me think about the finance charge. The question says that using the installment plan, the bedroom set can be purchased for a down payment of $337.60 and 18 monthly payments of $43.61.

So the total amount paid would be the down payment plus the sum of all monthly payments. Let me compute that. The down payment is $337.60. Each month, 18 times $43.61. Let me compute that: 18 multiplied by 43.61. Let me do this step by step. 10 times 43.61 is 436.10. 8 times 43.61 is 348.88. So adding them together: 436.10 + 348.88 = 784.98.

So the total amount paid is the down payment plus the sum of the monthly payments. So that's 337.60 + 784.98. Let's compute that. 337.60 + 784.98. 300 + 700 is 1000, 37.60 + 84.98 is 122.58. So total is 1000 + 122.58 = $1122.58. So the total amount paid is $1122.58.

The list price was $1010. So the total amount paid is $1122.58, which is more than the list price. The difference between the total and the list price is the finance charge. So finance charge = total paid - list price. That would be 1122.58 - 1010 = 112.58.

So the finance charge is $112.58. Now, I need to look at the options to see which one has a sale price of $975 and a finance charge of $112.58.

Looking back at the options:

A: Sale price 1122.58, finance 975. No, because sale price is wrong.

B: 1010, 1122.58. No, sale price is wrong and finance is wrong.

C: 975, 112.58. Yes, sale price is correct (975), finance is 112.58.

D: 1085, 272.58. No, sale price wrong.

E: 975, 1122.58. No, finance wrong.

F: 1122.58, 112.58. No, sale price wrong.

G: 850, 272.58. No, both wrong.

H: 850, 147.58. No, both wrong.

I: 975, 147.58. No, finance wrong.

J: 1010, 147.58. No, sale wrong.

So the correct option is option C, which has a sale price of $975 and finance charge of $112.58.

The sale price is calculated by subtracting the discount from the list price: $1010 - $35 = $975. The total amount paid under the installment plan is the sum of the down payment and the monthly payments: $337.60 + (18 Ã— $43.61) = $1122.58. The finance charge is the difference between the total paid and the list price: $1122.58 - $1010 = $112.58. Among the options, only option C matches these values.

ANSWER: C
