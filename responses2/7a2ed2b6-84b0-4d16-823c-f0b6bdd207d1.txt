Okay, so I've got this problem about tuning forks and beats. I'm a bit rusty on physics, but let's see if I can work through it.

So, the problem says that when two tuning forks are played together, a beat note of 5 cycles per second is heard. One fork has a known frequency of 256 cycles per second. Then, a small piece of adhesive tape is attached to this fork, which reduces the beat note to 3 cycles per second. The question is asking for the frequency of the other fork.

Hmm, beats... I remember that beats occur when two waves are close in frequency. The beat frequency is the absolute difference between the two frequencies. So, when two forks are close in frequency, you hear a beat. The number of beats per second is the beat frequency.

So, initially, one fork is 256 Hz. Let's call the other fork's frequency 'f'. The beat frequency without any change is |f - 256| = 5 Hz. That makes sense because 5 is the beat note.

Wait, but then the tape is attached, and the beat frequency changes to 3 Hz. So now, the two frequencies are 256 and f again. But when the tape is attached, the second fork is probably affected. Wait, no—wait, the problem says the tape is fastened to the first fork, which is 256 Hz. So, the other fork, which was probably at a different frequency, is now being modified by the tape.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "a small piece of adhesive tape fastened to this fork reduces the beat note to 3 cycles per second." So the tape affects the first fork (the one with 256 Hz). Because when you attach the tape, the frequency might change. Or wait, maybe the second fork's frequency is changed by the presence of the tape. Hmm.

Wait no, maybe the tape is attached to one of the forks, which is one of the sources. So, when the tape is attached to the 256 Hz fork, it affects the frequency of that fork. Let me think. The tape might cause some change in the frequency, perhaps lowering it. Because the tape makes it "stiffer" or something? Or maybe it's causing the fork to vibrate more quickly, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the tape affects the speed of sound or something else, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. The initial beat is 5 Hz. So the difference between 256 and f is 5. So f could be 256+5=311 or 256-5=251.

Then, when the tape is attached, that affects one of the frequencies. Let's say the first fork's frequency changes. Wait, the problem says the tape is attached to the first fork. So perhaps the first fork's frequency changes. Or maybe the other fork's frequency is altered because of the tape. Wait, the question says the other fork is "reduced to 3 cycles per second." Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. It says the tape reduces the beat note to 3 cycles per second. Or does it reduce the beat note? The initial beat is 5 cycles per second, and after, it's 3.

So, the two frequencies, after the tape is attached, are 256 and f', where the beat is |256 - f'| = 3.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the tape reduces the beat note to 3. So the beat after the tape is 3. So the original beat was 5, and after the tape, it's 3.

So, we have two equations.

First, before the tape is attached, the beat is 5: |256 - f| =5 → so f could be 256+5=261 or 256-5=251.

Then, after the tape is attached, the beat is 3: |256 - f'|=3 → f' could be 259 or 253.

Now, the question is about the other fork. So, which fork is which? The problem states that the tape is attached to the first fork (the one with 256 Hz). So, the other fork (f) is unaffected? Or is it that once the tape is attached, the first fork's frequency changes, and the beat changes to 3.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Initially, the two forks have frequencies 256 and f. The beat is 5. Then, the tape is attached to the 256 Hz fork. Now, the beat is 3. So the frequencies are 256 and f (the other), but the beat is 3.

So the equations are:

After the tape is attached: |256 - f| = 3 → f is either 256 +3=259 or 256-3=253.

So, the original f must be either 259 or 253.

Wait, but wait. Initially, without the tape, the beat was 5. So the original f must have been 256 ±5, which is 251 or 261.

Wait, so initially, the two possible f's are 251 and 261.

But after the tape is attached, the beat is 3. So f could be 259 or 253.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the f that we initially had was 251 or 261. But after the tape, the other fork is 259 or 253. So, perhaps the initial f was 251, and after the tape, the other fork is 259. Or initial f was 261, and after the tape, the other fork is 259? Because 261 is 256 +5, and 259 is 256 +3.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, after the tape is attached, the beat is |256 - f'| =3. So f' is either 253 or 259.

So, the initial f must have been either 259 or 253. But without the tape, the initial f was either 251 or 261.

So, which one?

Wait, perhaps the initial f was 251. Then, after the tape is attached, the other fork is 259. So, f' is 259. Then, the beat is |256 -259|=3. That fits.

Alternatively, if the initial f was 261, then after the tape is attached, the other fork is 253. So, |256 -253|=3, which also fits.

Wait, but then what's the other fork's frequency?

Wait, but the question is, what's the frequency of the other fork?

Wait, let me read the question again. The question says: "the other fork"—so the problem is that when the tape is attached, the beat note changes to 3.

Wait, so the original f was either 251 or 261. Then, after the tape is attached, the other fork is 259 or 253. So, which makes sense?

Wait, if the original f was 251, then the other fork after the tape is attached is 259. So, 256 and 259. The beat is 3.

Alternatively, if the original f was 261, then the other fork after the tape is attached is 253. So, 256 and 253. The beat is 3.

But wait, the problem says that the tape is attached to the first fork (256 Hz), and the beat is 3. So, the other fork is perhaps 253 or 259, depending on which of the two initial possibilities was correct.

Wait, but the initial problem says that one of the forks has a known frequency of 256 Hz. The other is unknown. So, when the tape is attached, the beat note is 3.

So, the original f could have been 251 or 261. So, if it's 251, then after the tape, the other fork is 259. So, 256 and 259. The beat is 3.

If the original f was 261, then after the tape, the other fork is 253. So, 256 and 253. The beat is 3.

But wait, the problem says the other fork's frequency is to be found. So, the correct answer must be one of the options. Let's look at the options.

Options:

A:255

B:248

C:262

D:251

E:249

F:257

G:261

H:247

I:259

J:263

Wait, so the possible f, after the tape is attached, would be either 259 or 253. So in the options, 259 is option I and 253 is not in the options. Wait, but I'm looking for the other fork's frequency. So, which one is correct?

Wait, but the problem is, the options don't include 253. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's re-express the problem. Let me restate:

After the tape is attached, the beat is 3. So, |f1 - f2|=3, where f1 is 256, and f2 is the other fork's frequency.

So, either f2 is 256+3=259 or 256-3=253.

But before, without the tape, the beat was 5. So, |256 - f_initial|=5 → f_initial is 251 or 261.

Wait, but the initial f_initial could be 251 or 261, and after the tape, the other fork's frequency is either 259 or 253.

But looking at the options, 259 is an option. 253 isn't. So, perhaps the initial f is 251, and after the tape, the other fork is 259.

Alternatively, initial f is 261, and after the tape, the other fork is 253 (but 253 isn't an option). So, perhaps the correct answer is 259.

Alternatively, let's think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps when the tape is attached, the frequency of the first fork changes. So, the first fork's frequency is now f1, and the other is f2. The beat is 3, so |f1 - f2|=3.

But the problem says the tape is attached to the first fork, which was originally 256. So, perhaps the first fork now has a different frequency, but the problem doesn't say anything about how the frequency changes. It's possible that the tape affects the first fork's frequency, but the problem doesn't give any info on that. So, perhaps it's a red herring.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's suppose that the tape affects the other fork. No, the problem says the tape is attached to the first fork. So, the first fork's frequency changes, and the second doesn't. Wait, no, the problem doesn't say anything about the second fork's frequency changing. So, perhaps the second fork's frequency remains the same, and the first's frequency changes.

Wait, but the problem doesn't say that. So, perhaps the tape only affects the first fork. So, in that case, the first fork's frequency changes, and the second's remains the same.

Wait, let me re-express the problem. The problem says that one of the forks has a known frequency of 256 Hz. The other is unknown. When both are played together, a beat of 5 Hz is heard. Then, when a piece of tape is attached to this 256 Hz fork, the beat note is reduced to 3 Hz.

So, the first fork (256 Hz) is modified by the tape. The second fork's frequency is unaffected.

So, the beat before modification is 5 Hz → |256 - f| =5 → f = 251 or 261.

After modification, the beat is 3 Hz → |256 - f'| =3 → f' =253 or 259.

But the problem is, which of these is the correct value for the other fork (f')?

Looking at the options, 253 is not present. So the only option near 253 is 259 (option I). But wait, the other fork's frequency must be either 253 or 259. So, how does that fit into the options?

Wait, the problem is: the other fork's frequency is to be found. So, which one is correct? Let's think: the original f could be 251 or 261. So, when the first fork is modified by the tape, what happens to the beat.

Wait, perhaps the other fork's frequency is 253, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the other fork is 259, which is option I.

Wait, but the options don't have 253. So perhaps the initial f is 261, and after the tape, the other fork is 259. But 259 is option I.

Wait, so if the other fork is 259, which is option I, then that's the answer. So, the correct answer would be option I.

Wait, but let me check again. Without the tape, the two forks have frequencies 256 and 261. So, the beat is |261-256|=5 Hz. That's correct.

After the tape, the first fork (256) is changed, and the other fork is 259. So, the beat is |256-259|=3 Hz. That makes sense.

So, the other fork is 259. Which is option I.

Wait, but the other fork's frequency is 259. So, the answer is option I.

The problem involves two tuning forks producing a beat note of 5 Hz when played together. One fork has a known frequency of 256 Hz. When a small piece of adhesive tape is attached to this fork, the beat note reduces to 3 Hz. The task is to determine the frequency of the other fork.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Beat Note**:  
   The beat frequency is the absolute difference between the frequencies of the two forks. Initially, the beat is 5 Hz, so the other fork's frequency, \( f \), must satisfy:  
   \[
   |256 - f| = 5 \implies f = 256 \pm 5 \implies f = 251 \, \text{Hz} \, \text{or} \, f = 261 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]

2. **After Adding the Tape**:  
   The tape affects the first fork (256 Hz), reducing the beat note to 3 Hz. This implies the other fork's frequency, \( f' \), must satisfy:  
   \[
   |256 - f'| = 3 \implies f' = 256 \pm 3 \implies f' = 253 \, \text{Hz} \, \text{or} \, f' = 259 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]

3. **Matching Frequencies**:  
   The initial frequency \( f \) could be either 251 Hz or 261 Hz. After the tape is attached, the other fork's frequency must match one of the possible values (253 Hz or 259 Hz).  
   - If \( f = 251 \, \text{Hz} \), the other fork's frequency would be 259 Hz (since \( |256 - 259| = 3 \)).  
   - If \( f = 261 \, \text{Hz} \), the other fork's frequency would be 253 Hz (since \( |256 - 253| = 3 \)).  

4. **Options Analysis**:  
   The given options are:  
   A: 255, B: 248, C: 262, D: 251, E: 249, F: 257, G: 261, H: 247, I: 259, J: 263.  
   Among these, the only possible frequency for the other fork is 259 Hz, which corresponds to **Option I**.

### Conclusion:
The frequency of the other fork is 259 Hz.
