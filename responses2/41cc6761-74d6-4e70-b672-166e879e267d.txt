Okay, so I've got this problem here where Sapphire is making bouquets of balloons for a graduation party. She has 179 balloons and needs to put 7 in each bouquet. The question is, how many bouquets can she make? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J, each with a different number.

Hmm, I remember that this is a division problem. She has a total number of balloons, and she wants to divide them into groups of 7. So, I think I need to divide 179 by 7 to find out how many full bouquets she can make.

Let me do the division step by step. 7 goes into 17 how many times? Well, 7 times 2 is 14, which is less than 17, and 7 times 3 is 21, which is too much. So, 2 times. Multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, subtract that from 17, and you have 3 left. Bring down the 9 to make 39.

Now, how many times does 7 go into 39? Let's see, 7 times 5 is 35, which is less than 39, and 7 times 6 is 42, which is too big. So, 5 times. Multiply 7 by 5 to get 35, subtract from 39, and you have 4 left.

So far, we've got 25 bouquets, and there's 4 balloons remaining. Since she can't make a partial bouquet with just 4, the total number of bouquets she can make is 25.

Looking at the options, D is 25, so that must be the correct answer.

The correct answer is D: 25 bouquets.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Division Problem:** We need to divide the total number of balloons (179) by the number per bouquet (7).
2. **First Division:** 7 into 17 is 2, remainder 3.
3. **Second Division:** Bring down the 9 to make 39. 7 into 39 is 5, remainder 4.
4. **Remainder:** There's 4 balloons left, which isn't enough for a bouquet.
5. **Total Bouquets:** 25 bouquets with 4 balloons remaining.

**Answer:** D: 25 bouquets
