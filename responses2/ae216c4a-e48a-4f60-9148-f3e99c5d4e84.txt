The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What is mutualism? Give three examples of this type of relationship.

Options:

A: Mutualism is a relationship where one species benefits and the other is harmed. Examples include: the clownfish and sea anemone, oxpeckers and rhinos, and honeybees and flowers.
B: Mutualism is a relationship where one species benefits and the other is unaffected. Examples include: barnacles on whales, remoras on sharks, and orchids growing on trees.
C: In the mutualistic type of relationship, both species benefit from each other. Examples include: Nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium and legumes, lichens which are a combination of fungi and algae, and ants and aphids or scale insects.
D: Only one species benefits in mutualism
E: Mutualism is a relationship where both species are harmed. Examples include: parasitic wasps and caterpillars, mistletoe and trees, and tapeworms and mammals.
F: Mutualism is a type of relationship where both species compete for resources. Examples include: different tree species in a forest, coral and algae, and various species of scavengers on a carcass.
G: Mutualism does not occur in plants
H: Mutualism refers to the relationship between predator and prey. Examples include: cheetahs and gazelles, wolves and deer, and hawks and rodents.
I: Examples of mutualism include lion and gazelle, cat and mouse, wolf and rabbit
J: Examples of mutualism include sharks and remoras, crocodiles and plover birds, and humans and domesticated animals.

Okay, so I've got this question about mutualism. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition, but I remember that mutualism involves two different species that benefit from each other. Like, their relationship is mutual because both are doing well.

The question is asking for three examples and the correct choice among A to J. Let's break it down.

First, I need to understand each option. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A says mutualism is a relationship where one benefits and the other is harmed. The examples are clownfish and sea anemone, oxpeckers and rhinos, and honeybees and flowers. Wait, I think those are actually parasitism or commensalism, not mutualism. Like, the clownfish benefits and the anemone is harmed. So A's description is wrong.

Option B claims mutualism is where one benefits and the other is unaffected. Examples are barnacles on whales, remoras on sharks, and orchids on trees. Again, barnacles are predators, so they benefit, but the other species are probably not unaffected. So B is incorrect.

Option C states mutualism is where both benefit. Examples include Rhizobium, lichens, and ants/aphids. Wait, rhizobium is a good example of mutualism since it's a bacteria that benefits from legumes. Lichens are mutualistic too, fungi and algae. Ants and aphids are mutualistic—both benefit. So C's description and examples are correct.

Option D says only one species benefits. That's not mutualism. It's more like commensalism, where one benefits and the other doesn't. So D is incorrect.

Option E says mutualism is both species are harmed. Examples include wasps and caterpillars, mistletoe and trees, etc. That's commensalism again, not mutualism. So E is wrong.

Option F suggests both compete for resources. That's usually mutualistic, like mutualistic relationships where both benefit from the same resources, but I'm not sure. Wait, no. Wait, mutualism often leads to mutual benefits, sometimes even coexistence. But I'm a bit confused. For example, plants and fungi can share resources, so they might be mutualistic. So F says mutualism is where both compete, which doesn't sound right. I thought mutualism is about mutual benefits, not competition. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G says mutualism doesn't occur in plants. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. I remember that mutualism is common in plants. For instance, ants and flowers are mutualistic. So G is incorrect.

Option H refers to predator-prey, which is mutualism only in certain cases. For example, predators and prey are mutualistic. But H's description is that mutualism is when a predator and prey are involved. So H is correct in that mutualism includes such relationships. Wait, but option H's statement is that mutualism is a relationship where both are involved, which is correct. So H is correct in its description but the option itself (like the answer choices) may not be about the definition.

Wait, the options A to H are the choices. So each option is a statement followed by examples. So the correct answer (the three correct examples) would be in one of these options.

Wait, the question is asking which option lists the correct three examples of mutualism. So each option (A-J) is a statement followed by examples. We need to find which option correctly describes mutualism and lists three correct examples.

So, correct mutualism examples are those where both species benefit.

Looking at option C: It lists Rhizobium and legumes (mutual), lichens (mutual), and ants and aphids (mutual). That's three correct examples. So option C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

The correct answer is **C**, which accurately describes mutualism as a relationship where both species benefit. The examples provided—Rhizobium and legumes, lichens, and ants and aphids—are all instances of mutualism.

**Answer: C**
