Alright, so I've got this question here about the tax shield in a firm's valuation. Hmm, let's see. Okay, the question says that the value of the firm is $5 million, and its value if unlevered is $4.78 million. Oh, wait, and there's also a present value of bankruptcy and agency costs of $360,000. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

I remember that the tax shield is the benefit a company gets from the tax savings due to having a certain level of debt. But wait, in this case, the question doesn't mention any debt. So maybe the tax shield is calculated differently here. Oh, right! There's a concept called the tax-equivalent value. Or wait, sometimes when a firm is leveraged, the tax shield is calculated based on whether the firm is leveraged or not.

Wait, the value of the firm with debt (V_L) is often compared to the unlevered value (V_U). The tax shield comes from the difference between these two values. So the tax shield (T) is typically (V_U - V_L) multiplied by the tax rate (t). But wait, in this question, I don't see a tax rate given. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Oh wait, perhaps the formula for the tax shield is (Value of levered firm - Unlevered value) × tax rate. But since the tax rate isn't provided, maybe the question is using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the tax shield is calculated from the present value of the costs. Wait, wait. Let me re-read the question.

The value of the firm is $5 million. The value if unlevered is $4.78 million. The present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000. Wait, so the question is asking for the tax shield. But I'm not sure how to connect the given numbers to the tax shield. Unless the tax shield is the difference between the levered and unlevered value.

Wait, but the present value of the costs is $360k. Maybe that's the PV of the tax shield? Or perhaps it's part of the calculation.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The tax shield is the benefit a company gets from having debt. So the formula for the tax shield is (Debt × Tax Rate). But in the absence of debt, the value of the firm is V_U. So the value with debt is V_L = V_U - tax shield. Or wait, is it V_L = V_U + tax shield? Because a higher value of the firm would mean more tax savings, so the tax shield would be the extra value.

Wait, wait, let me get this straight. If a company is leveraged, its value should be higher than its unlevered value because it can offer tax benefits. So V_L = V_U + tax shield. Or is it the other way around? Let me think about it again. Without debt, the value is V_U. With debt, the value is V_L, which is higher, but the tax shield is the difference between V_L and V_U. So tax shield (T) = V_L - V_U.

But in this question, the value of the firm is given as $5 million, which is V_L. The value if unlevered is $4.78 million, so V_U is 4.78. So the tax shield would be 5 -4.78 = $0.22 million, which is $220,000. That's option G.

Wait, but wait a second. The question gives me the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs as $360,000. I'm not sure if that's relevant here because if the firm is leveraged, the tax shield would be calculated differently. Alternatively, maybe the tax shield is only from the debt, but since the question doesn't provide the debt amount or the tax rate, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the approach.

Alternatively, the formula might be tax shield = (Value of firm - Unlevered value) × (1 - t). But without t, how can I calculate it? Oh wait, perhaps the PV of the costs is part of the tax shield? Let me think. The present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is the PV of the tax benefits. So the tax shield is the PV of the costs, which is $360,000. Wait, but that doesn't fit with the earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe the tax shield is the difference between the levered and unlevered value, which is 5 -4.78=0.22 million, so $220k. That's option G.

But why would the PV of costs matter here? Maybe I'm mixing concepts. Let me try to think again. The tax shield is the amount that the company saves in taxes because of interest. So, the tax shield (TS) is equal to T * (Debt - tax shield). Wait, no, the formula is usually TS = D * t, where D is the debt. So the value of the levered firm is V_L = V_U + TS.

In this case, V_U is 4.78, V_L is 5. So TS would be 5 -4.78 = $0.22 million, so $220,000, which is option G.

But then why is the PV of costs given as 360k? Unless that's a distractor. Wait, perhaps the PV of the costs is part of the tax shield. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the PV is the tax shield, that would be 360k, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the difference between the levered and unlevered values.

So the correct answer is G: $220,000.

To determine the value of the tax shield, we start by noting the following:

- The value of the firm (V_L) is $5 million.
- The value of the firm if unlevered (V_U) is $4.78 million.
- The present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000.

The tax shield (TS) is the difference between the levered value of the firm and the unlevered value of the firm:

\[
\text{TS} = V_L - V_U
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{TS} = 5,000,000 - 4,780,000 = 220,000
\]

Thus, the tax shield is $220,000. The present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is not directly relevant to this calculation, as the tax shield is derived from the difference in value between the levered and unlevered firms.
