Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of gas laws and densities. Let's see what the question is. 

The problem says: At standard conditions, 28.0 g of carbon monoxide occupies 22.4 L. Wait, wait, standard conditions. Oh right, standard temperature and pressure are 0°C and 1 atm, sometimes called STP. But wait, wait, the question says "at standard conditions" but the real conditions given are 20°C and 600 torr. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, wait, no, the question actually says "at 20°C and 600 torr" and we're to find the density. Oh wait, no, the given data is that 28.0 g CO occupies 22.4 L at standard conditions. So I think that the question is using standard conditions (0°C and 1 atm) as the basis, but the problem is asking about a different set of conditions (20°C and 600 torr). Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read again.

No, the problem says, "What is the density of carbon monoxide at 20°C and 600 torr?" So the real conditions are 20°C and 600 torr. The provided data is at standard conditions, but I'm not sure if it's needed here. Or perhaps it's a distractor. Wait, the question gives 28g CO in 22.4L at standard conditions, but that's probably to help us find the molar mass or something else. Maybe I should focus on the question at hand.

The question is about finding the density of CO at 20°C and 600 torr. I remember that density (d) is mass (m) divided by volume (V). So d = m / V.

But wait, the given data is 28.0 g in 22.4 L at standard conditions. Wait, at STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L. So 28g CO is 1 mole. Because molar mass of CO is 12 +16=28g/mol. So yes, 28g is 1 mole at STP.

So at standard conditions, 1 mole occupies 22.4 L. But the problem is about a different set of conditions: 20°C and 600 torr. So I need to adjust for those conditions.

Wait, but the question is giving us 28g CO in 22.4 L at STP. Wait, but the question is about the density at 20°C and 600 torr. So perhaps the provided data isn't directly needed; perhaps it's a distractor to test if I know how to adjust for different conditions when calculating density.

Wait, no, let me think again. The question is about the density of CO at 20°C and 600 torr. So I need to calculate the density under these conditions.

So the formula for density is (mass)/(volume). But the volume given is 22.4 L at STP, but I need to find the volume under the different conditions. Alternatively, perhaps I should first find the number of moles at the new conditions and then calculate density.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's better to find the molar mass and then use the ideal gas law to find the volume under the given conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the given mass and volume can help me find the density at STP, and then relate it to the new conditions.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, find the molar mass of CO. It's 12.01 (carbon) + 16.00 (oxygen) = 28.01 g/mol. So 28.0 g is approximately 1 mole.

At standard conditions (0°C, 1 atm), 1 mole occupies 22.4 L. So, 1 mole CO would occupy 22.4 L. But the problem gives 22.4 L for 28g CO, which is correct because 28g is 1 mole.

Wait, but the question is about density at 20°C and 600 torr. So I need to find the density at that point.

Density (d) is mass/volume. The mass is 28g. The volume is what I need to find under the new conditions.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the ideal gas law to find the volume under the new conditions.

Wait, but wait, the given data is at STP. So the number of moles is 1 mole. But when the conditions change, the volume and pressure change, so the volume would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of moles using the ideal gas law at STP, then use that same number of moles to calculate the volume under the new conditions, then find the density.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT.

At STP: P = 1 atm, V = 22.4 L, n = 1 mole, T = 273 K.

We can rearrange the equation to find n, but since it's 1 mole, that's already done.

Now, for the new conditions: P_new = 600 torr. Let me convert that to atm because STP is in atm. 1 atm is 760 torr. So 600 torr is 600/760 atm.

Wait, 600 divided by 760 is approximately 0.789 atm.

The new temperature is 20°C, which is 293 K.

So, at new conditions, the volume V_new can be found using the ideal gas law. Since the number of moles (n) is the same as it's the same amount of substance, we can set up the ratio.

Because PV = nRT, at STP, P1 V1 = n R T1. At new conditions, P2 V2 = n R T2. Since n is same, V2 = [ (P1 V1 T2 ) ] / ( P2 T1 )

Wait, let me see. Because V1 is 22.4 L, P1 is 1 atm, T1 is 273 K. V2 is the volume at new conditions, P2 is 600 torr (0.789 atm), T2 is 293 K.

So V2 = (P1 V1 T2) / (P2 T1 )

Plugging in the numbers: V2 = (1 atm * 22.4 L * 293 K) / (0.789 atm * 273 K )

Let me compute that.

First, compute the numerator: 1 * 22.4 * 293.

22.4 * 293: Let's compute 22 * 293 is 6446, and 0.4 *293=117.2. So 6446 +117.2 = 6563.2. So 6563.2 L·atm·K.

Denominator: 0.789 atm * 273 K = 0.789 * 273 = let's calculate that.

0.7 *273 = 191.1, 0.089 *273 ≈ 24.417. So total ≈ 191.1 +24.417=215.517 atm·K.

So V2 = 6563.2 / 215.517 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 6563.2 by 215.517.

Well, 215 * 30 is 6450. 215 * 30.5 = 215 *30 + 215*0.5 = 6450 +107.5=6557.5. So 215.517 *30.5 ≈6557.5, which is close to 6563.2.

So 30.5 would give us 6557.5. The difference is 6563.2-6557.5=5.7.

5.7 / 215.517 ≈ 0.0265.

So V2≈30.5265 L. Approximately 30.53 L.

So the volume at the new conditions is roughly 30.53 L.

Wait, but wait. If the original volume was 22.4 L at STP, which is 0°C and 1 atm. So when I apply the ideal gas law, the volume increases because the pressure drops and temperature increases.

Wait, but more accurately, let's compute V2 without approximations.

Compute V2 = (1 atm * 22.4 L * 293 K) / ( (600/760 atm) * 273 K )

So 600/760 = 0.78947 atm.

So denominator: 0.78947 * 273 ≈ 0.78947 *273.

Let me compute 0.7 *273 = 191.1, 0.08947 *273≈24.46. So total is 191.1 +24.46=215.56.

So denominator is 215.56 atm·K.

Numerator: 22.4 *293 = Let's compute 22 *293=6446, 0.4 *293=117.2. Total 6446+117.2=6563.2 L·atm.

So V2 = 6563.2 / 215.56 ≈ let's compute.

215.56 *30 =6466.8. 6563.2-6466.8=96.4.

So 96.4 / 215.56 ≈ 0.448.

So V2 ≈30.448 L.

So approximately 30.45 L.

So the volume under new conditions is about 30.45 L.

But wait, the mass is 28.0 g, which is 1 mole.

Density d = mass / volume = 28.0 g / 30.45 L ≈ ?

Dividing 28 by 30.45. Let me see: 30.45 is about 30.45.

30.45 goes into 28 about 0.9198 times.

Because 30.45 *0.9 = 27.405; 30.45 *0.9198 = 28.0.

Wait, let's compute 30.45 * 0.9198.

30.45 * 0.9 = 27.405,

30.45 * 0.0198 = Let me compute 30.45 *0.02 = 0.609, but since it's 0.0198, 30.45 *0.0198= 30.45 * (0.02 -0.0002) = 0.609 - 0.00609 = 0.60291.

So total is 27.405 +0.60291≈28.00791, which is about 28.01 g. So yes, 30.45 L gives 28.0 g at 20°C.

So density d=28.0 /30.45≈0.9198 g/L.

Looking at the options, option H is .9198 g/l. Wait, but wait, the options are A to J. Let me check what the options say.

The options are:

A:1.96
B:1.00
C:0.789
D:1.25
E:0.50
F:2.225
G:1.482
H: .9198 g/l
I: 0.625
J: 0.345

So the correct answer is H: .9198 g/l.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because I assumed that the mass is 28.0 g, which is 1 mole. But wait, the problem says, "28.0 g of carbon monoxide occupies 22.4 L at standard conditions". So that's 1 mole. So when we compute the density under new conditions, we have 28 g in 30.45 L, which gives 0.9198 g/l. So option H is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume under new conditions. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, another approach. Using the ideal gas law, the density can be written as d = (PM)/(RT), where M is the molar mass.

But wait, because d = (m/V) = (PM)/(RT) because m = n M, and V = n (RT/P) (from PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT) → n = (P V)/(R T) → m = n M = (P V M)/(R T) → d = (P M)/(R T).

So, d = (P * M) / (R T).

Wait, but wait, let's see:

d = mass / volume = (n M) / V = (P V / RT) * M / V = (P M) / (R T).

Yes, correct. So d = (P M)/(R T).

But wait, the units may require consideration. Because R is in L·atm/(mol·K), and T is in K.

So, let me compute that.

We have P = 600 torr → 600 /760 atm ≈0.7895 atm.

M = 28.01 g/mol.

R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T=20°C=293 K.

So d = (0.7895 atm * 28.01 g/mol) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 293 K )

Compute numerator: 0.7895 *28.01 ≈ 0.7895 *28 ≈22.106, plus 0.7895 *0.01=0.007895 → 22.1139.

Denominator: 0.0821 *293 ≈ 24.1253.

So d= 22.1139 /24.1253 ≈0.917 g/L.

Which is approximately 0.9198, which matches our earlier calculation. So the answer is H: .9198 g/l.
</think>

To determine the density of carbon monoxide (CO) at 20°C and 600 torr, we use the relationship between density, pressure, molar mass, and temperature. Density is defined as:

\[
d = \frac{PM}{RT}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the pressure in atmospheres,
- \( M \) is the molar mass of CO (28.01 g/mol),
- \( R \) is the ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin (20°C = 293 K).

### Step 1: Convert pressure to atmospheres
The given pressure is 600 torr. Since 1 atm = 760 torr, the pressure in atmospheres is:

\[
P = \frac{600}{760} \approx 0.7895 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the density
Substitute the values into the density formula:

\[
d = \frac{(0.7895 \, \text{atm})(28.01 \, \text{g/mol})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(293 \, \text{K})}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(0.7895)(28.01) \approx 22.11 \, \text{g·atm/(mol·K)}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
(0.0821)(293) \approx 24.13 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{22.11}{24.13} \approx 0.9198 \, \text{g/L}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated density is approximately \( 0.9198 \, \text{g/L} \), which corresponds to option **H: .9198 g/l**.
