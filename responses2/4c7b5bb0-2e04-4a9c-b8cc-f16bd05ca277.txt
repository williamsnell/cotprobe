The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our kingdoms."
Letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, 1526
Source 2:
"This expedition has cost us much: it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand—as though speaking in our name—what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the tone of a letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal. I need to figure out which development in early modern Africa this letter reflects. The options are A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The letter is from a Kongo king to a Portuguese one. The content mentions the issue of many people wanting to go to Kongo's kingdoms but being taken and sold to white men, especially noblemen and relatives. So, it's about exploitation and abuse, not just helping or protecting.

Looking at the options, let's think about each one:

A: Encouragement of European settlers in Africa. Well, since this is about Kongo and Portugal, it's more about Portuguese influence rather than European settlers. So probably not A.

B: Rising interest in European political structures. The letter isn't about political movements or influencing politics; it's more about exploitation. So B might not fit.

C: Vigorous resistance to European expeditions. The letter describes a situation where Portuguese forces are being used to exploit Kongo people, which shows a resistance to European intervention. That sounds like C.

D: Consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast. The letter doesn't talk about states or Atlantic coast; it's about Kongo and Portugal, not Europe. So D is probably not it.

E: Introduction of European agricultural methods. The letter doesn't mention anything about farming or new methods. It's about people being taken and sold, so E probably isn't the right choice.

F: Promotion of Christianity. The content doesn't mention religion or Christian promotion; it's about trade and exploitation. So F is out.

G: Acceptance of European culture. Again, no mention of cultural acceptance; it's about exploitation and abuse. So G isn't correct.

H: Establishment of trading posts. The letter talks about many being taken, which could mean that trade was happening, but it's more about the method (trading to white men) than establishing trading posts. So H might not be the answer.

I: Growing dependence on trade for manufactured goods. The letter is about people being taken and sold, not manufacturing goods. So I is not likely.

J: Diplomatic alliance. The letter is a letter, not an alliance. So J is not it.

Wait, but the options are A to J, so let me double-check. I thought C was about resistance. The letter shows that Portuguese forces are using Kongo people as tools to exploit them, which is a form of resistance against European colonial methods. So the tone reflects resistance to European expansion and exploration in Africa, which is part of the broader European colonialism. So the answer should be C.

The letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal describes a situation where Portuguese forces exploit Kongo people, leading to their capture and exploitation. This reflects a resistance to European colonial methods, particularly in exploiting African populations.

Answer: C
