Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.

Options:

A: Neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals traveling towards the dendrites only.
B: The receptors for neurotransmitters are only found on the axonal terminals.
C: The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only.
D: The synaptic vesicle is present inside the dendrites of a neuron.
E: The axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters.
F: The neurotransmitter degrades immediately upon release and cannot travel to the axon.
G: The dendrites actively pump the neurotransmitter back to the axon after it has been received.
H: The neurotransmitter is present in the dendritic end of a neuron only.
I: The dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates the effect of the axonal neurotransmitter.
J: The neurotransmitter can travel in both directions.

Okay, so I've got this question about how neurotransmitters move across synapses. I'm a bit rusty on my neuroscience, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that chemical transmission at a synapse is unidirectional, meaning neurotransmitters always go from the presynaptic axon to the post-synaptic dendrite. I need to figure out why that's the case. The options are A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm. I remember that neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic vesicles on the presynaptic neuron's axon. Then, these vesicles are supposed to head to the postsynaptic neuron's dendrites. But wait, why can't they go the other way? Oh, right, the axon terminals don't have the machinery to release neurotransmitters. I think that's option E.

Wait, let me recap. The axon, which is the presynaptic part, has its own axon terminals that release neurotransmitters. These are usually the places where action potentials are sent along the axon. But the postsynaptic area, the axon terminals of the postsynaptic neuron, don't have those same release mechanisms. So the vesicles can't come back. That's why the neurotransmitter goes from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic.

Looking at the options again, option E says the axonal terminals don't release. That makes sense. Option I says it can go both ways, which I don't think is correct. So E is likely the correct answer.

The correct explanation is that the axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters, preventing the vesicles from traveling back. 

Answer: E
