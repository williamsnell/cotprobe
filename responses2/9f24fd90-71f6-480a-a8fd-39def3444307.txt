Okay, so I have to evaluate log base 8 of 2, which is written as log₈(2). I remember that logarithms are essentially asking the question: "To what power should I raise the base to get the number?" So in this case, the base is 8, and the number is 2. 

I think about the definition of logarithms. If log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So applying that here, I'm looking for a number c such that 8^c equals 2. 

Wait, 8 is 2 cubed, right? Because 2*2 is 4, and 4*2 is 8. So 8 is 2³. So 8^c is equal to 2. But 8 is 2^3, so substituting that in, we have (2^3)^c = 2. 

When you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So (2^3)^c becomes 2^(3c). So now we have 2^(3c) = 2^1. Since the bases are the same and the equation holds, the exponents must be equal. So 3c = 1. 

Solving for c, I divide both sides by 3: c = 1/3. 

So log base 8 of 2 is 1/3. Looking at the options, option A is 1/3. So the correct answer should be A.

The question asks to evaluate log₈(2). Using the definition of logarithms, we find that log₈(2) is the exponent that 8 must be raised to in order to get 2. Since 8 is 2³, we substitute to find that 8^c = 2 implies c = 1/3. Thus, log₈(2) = 1/3, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
