Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about family therapy and the structural approach. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully about each option. Let me start by recalling what I know about the structural approach in therapy, which is based on the work of Salvador Minuchin.

The structural approach focuses on identifying and addressing the root causes of family issues rather than just dealing with symptoms one by one. It's more about understanding the bigger picture and working together to develop solutions. So, the therapist would probably approach the family from a systems perspective.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Use a single-therapist model to maintain consistency. Hmm, the structural approach is more about a team approach, not a single therapist. I think Minuchin was known for team therapy, so maybe a single therapist isn't typical. I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Sole focus on individual therapy sessions. Structural approach is more about working together than individually. So maybe B is not the right answer.

Option C: Work with the most differentiated family member. That sounds more like client-centered approaches, like person-centered therapy. The structural approach is more about team dynamics and communication, so C might not fit.

Option D: Avoid discussing family dynamics and focus on external factors. That sounds more client-focused rather than structural. I don't think D is correct.

Option E: Encourage family members to solve issues independently without intervention. That sounds like a client-centered approach again, which is less about the structural model. So E might not be right.

Option F: Avoid issuing directives and let them find their own solutions. That's a client-centered approach, which Minuchin's structural approach might not support. So F probably isn't the answer.

Option G: Use multiple therapists to prevent triangulation. I remember Minuchin did a lot of work with team therapy, which I think is a group approach. So G might not be the right answer.

Option H: Encourage groupthink to prevent enmeshment. Groupthink is more of a client approach, so H doesn't fit.

Option I: Clarify boundaries to reduce enmeshment. That seems more client-focused, so I think I's not the answer.

Wait, let me think again. The structural approach is about working together to solve the bigger issues. So the therapist would probably work with multiple families, addressing their issues collaboratively. The question's about what the family therapist would do, so they might use a team approach, perhaps multiple therapists working together.

Looking back at the options, let me check the wording. Option G says "use a multiple-therapist team to prevent any one therapist from becoming triangulated." Wait, triangulation is when a therapist is overrepresented, causing conflict. So structurally, having multiple therapists ensures that no one is overburdened. That makes sense because Minuchin talked about team dynamics and ensuring balanced involvement from all members.

So the correct answer would be G. It aligns with the structural approach by promoting team therapy where multiple therapists work together to address family issues collaboratively without overloading any single therapist.

The structural approach, rooted in the work of Salvador Minuchin, emphasizes a team-based approach to address family issues collectively. This approach prioritizes collaboration among therapists and families to prevent triangulation and ensure balanced involvement. The correct answer is G: "use a multiple-therapist team to prevent any one therapist from becoming triangulated into the family system."

**Answer: G**
