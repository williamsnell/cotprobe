Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the vapor pressure of water using the gas saturation method. Hmm, I remember that in this method, you pass a gas (like nitrogen) through water and collect the vapor. The amount of water that remains uncollected should be the vapor that's left behind, right?

So the problem states that 100 liters of N2 gas is passed through 65.44 grams of water. After that, 63.13 grams of water remain. The temperature of the water is 25°C. I need to find the vapor pressure of water at 25°C.

Wait, vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by the vapor in equilibrium with its liquid (water) at a given temperature. So the pressure here would be the vapor pressure of water at 25°C, but I think I might have to calculate it using the amount of water vaporized.

Let me think. The mass of water that evaporated is the initial mass minus the remaining mass. The initial water is 65.44 grams. So mass evaporated would be 65.44 g - 63.13 g. Let me do that calculation. 65.44 minus 63.13 is 2.31 grams. So 2.31 grams of water vaporized.

The volume of N2 gas used is 100 liters. But wait, I need to find the pressure. I remember the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

So, I have to find the pressure, which is P. Let's try to rearrange the equation: P = (nRT)/V.

But first, I need to find the moles of water vapor. The molar mass of water (H2O) is about 18.015 g/mol. So, moles = mass / molar mass. So 2.31 grams / 18.015 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 2.31 divided by 18.015 is approximately 0.1283 mol. Let me double-check that division: 18.015 * 0.12 is 2.1618, which is less than 2.31. 0.1283 * 18.015 ≈ 2.31. Yep, about 0.1283 moles.

Now, the temperature is 25°C, which is 298.15 K. Wait, sometimes it's rounded to 298 K for simplicity. Let's go with 298 K.

Next, the volume is 100 liters. But I need to make sure that the units match. The ideal gas law uses volume in liters, pressure in atmospheres, etc. So I should consider units. Let me see: R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K if I use atm, or other units as needed.

Wait, wait. Let me get the units right. The ideal gas law uses pressure in Pascals (if using SI units), but more commonly, in mmHg, atmospheres, or torr. But since the options are in mmHg, maybe that's easier. Alternatively, if I convert the volume to liters (which it is), and use R in appropriate units.

Wait, better to use R in terms of mmHg. Oh, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps use R = 62.3637 L·mmHg/mol·K. Because if I use that, the pressure comes out in mmHg, which is what the options are. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can use mmHg as the pressure. Let me think. In some sources, R is 62.36 L·mmHg/(mol·K) at 0°C, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the correct value. Oh, wait, the value of R is 62.3637 L·mmHg/mol·K when using that in the ideal gas law when pressure is in mmHg.

So, R = 62.3637 L·mmHg/(mol·K)

So, substituting into P = (nRT)/V.

n is 0.1283 mol. T is 298 K. V is 100 L.

So, P = (0.1283 mol * 62.3637 L·mmHg/mol·K * 298 K) / 100 L.

Let me compute the numerator first. 0.1283 * 62.3637 ≈ let me calculate that.

0.1283 * 62.3637. Let's approximate:

62.3637 * 0.1 =6.23637

62.3637 * 0.0283 ≈ 62.3637 * 0.028 = approx 1.746, plus 0.00037*62.3637≈0.023. So 1.746 + 0.023 ≈1.769. So total is 6.236 +1.769 ≈8.005.

Wait, but perhaps better to compute it more accurately.

0.1283 * 62.3637 = ?

Let me compute 0.1 * 62.3637 =6.23637

0.02 *62.3637=1.247274

0.008 *62.3637=0.49891

0.0003 *62.3637≈0.018709.

Adding them up: 6.23637 +1.247274 = 7.483644; +0.49891=7.982554; +0.018709=8.001263.

Wait, and the 0.1283 is 0.1 +0.02 +0.008 +0.0003. So yes, that's correct.

So 8.001263, multiplied by 298 K.

8.001263 * 298 = ?

Let me compute 8 * 298 = 2384.

0.001263 * 298 = approx 0.374694.

So total is 2384 + 0.374694 = 2384.374694.

So the numerator is 2384.374694 mmHg·L / (mol·K) * mol * K → gives mmHg·L → then divided by 100 L. So, wait, the units are (mol * K) * K) → no. Let me retrace.

Wait, the formula is P = (n R T) / V.

n is moles, R is in L·mmHg/(mol·K), T in K, V in L.

So, the units are:

mol * (L·mmHg/(mol·K)) * K ) / L.

The "mol" cancels, K cancels, and L cancels. So overall, P is mmHg.

So, the calculation is (0.1283 *62.3637 *298 ) /100 → which I've calculated as 2384.374694 / 100 = 23.8437 mmHg.

Wait, so approximately 23.84 mmHg.

Looking at the options, option F is 23.8 mm. That's very close. So the answer should be F: 23.8 mm.

Hmm, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check each step.

Calculating n: 2.31g of H2O is 2.31 /18.015 = approx 0.1283 mol. Correct.

R = 62.3637 L·mmHg/(mol·K). Correct.

So, nRT = 0.1283 *62.3637 * 298.

Wait, 0.1283 *62.3637 = approx 8.00126, as before.

8.00126 *298 = let's compute this.

298 *8 = 2384.

298 *0.00126 = approx 0.37428.

So total is 2384.37428.

Divide by 100 L: 2384.37428 /100 = 23.84374 mmHg.

So, about 23.84 mmHg. So the closest option is F: 23.8 mm.

But wait, wait! Let me check the initial calculation. The mass of water that evaporates is 65.44g -63.13g = 2.31g. So, correct. So that's the amount that vaporized.

Wait another thing: sometimes, in gas saturation, the pressure is determined by the amount of vapor, but perhaps the method is different. Oh wait, no, I think the method is correct as per the problem statement: the mass of water that remains is 63.13g, which is the unevaporated part. So the water that evaporated is 2.31g, so the number of moles is correct.

So the calculation seems right. So the answer should be F.
</think>

To determine the vapor pressure of water at 25°C using the gas saturation method, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the mass of water vaporized**:  
   The initial mass of water is 65.44 g, and the remaining mass is 63.13 g.  
   \[
   \text{Mass of water vaporized} = 65.44 \, \text{g} - 63.13 \, \text{g} = 2.31 \, \text{g}
   \]

2. **Convert the mass of water vaporized to moles**:  
   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18.015 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of water vaporized} = \frac{2.31 \, \text{g}}{18.015 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.1283 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Use the ideal gas law to calculate the vapor pressure**:  
   The volume of nitrogen gas is 100 L, the temperature is 25°C (298 K), and the gas constant \( R \) is 62.3637 L·mmHg/(mol·K).  
   The ideal gas law is:
   \[
   P = \frac{nRT}{V}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P = \frac{(0.1283 \, \text{mol}) \cdot (62.3637 \, \text{L·mmHg/(mol·K)}) \cdot (298 \, \text{K})}{100 \, \text{L}}
   \]
   First, calculate the numerator:
   \[
   0.1283 \cdot 62.3637 \cdot 298 \approx 2384.37 \, \text{L·mmHg}
   \]
   Then, divide by the volume:
   \[
   P = \frac{2384.37}{100} \approx 23.84 \, \text{mmHg}
   \]

4. **Match the result to the closest option**:  
   The calculated vapor pressure is approximately 23.84 mmHg, which corresponds to option F (23.8 mm).
