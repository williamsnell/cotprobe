Okay, so I have this question about Mercury's distance from the sun. I remember that Mercury orbits the sun much more slowly than Earth. Let me think. The question says Mercury's orbital period is about one-fifth of an Earth year. Oh, right, Kepler's laws here must be in play. Kepler's third law relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis of the orbit.

Wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So for two objects orbiting the same star, like the sun, T² ∝ a³. So if I take the cube root of the period ratio, I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Let me write that down. Let T be the period and a be the semi-major axis. So T₁³ / T₂³ = a₁³ / a₂³.

Wait, wait, no. Kepler's law in its exact form is T² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³. So for the same star, the constant (4π²/G) is the same. So when comparing two planets, T1² / T2² = a1³ / a2³.

So in this case, Earth's orbital period is T, Mercury's is T/5. So T² / (T/5)^2 = 25. So (a1³)/(a2³) = 25, so a1/a2 = cube root of 25.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Let me assign Earth's period as T, then Mercury's is T/5. So the ratio of their periods is T : (T/5) = 5:1.

Wait wait, no. Wait, Earth's period is T, Mercury's is T/5. So the ratio of their periods (Earth to Mercury) is 5:1.

So (T_earth)^2 / (T_mercury)^2 = (T_earth)^2 / ( (T_earth)/5 )^2 = 25.

So (a_earth)^3 / (a_mercury)^3 = 25. So (a_mercury)^3 = (a_earth)^3 /25.

So a_mercury is (a_earth) divided by cube root of 25. Cube root of 27 is 3, so cube root of 25 is a little less than 3, maybe around 2.924.

Wait, but the question says that 1 AU is the distance from Earth to the Sun. Mercury's distance from the Sun is a_mercury. So Earth's a_earth is 1 AU.

So a_mercury = 1 AU / cube_root(25). Let me calculate cube_root(25). 2³ is 8, 3³ is 27. So cube_root(25) is about 2.924. So a_mercury is approximately 1/2.924 AU.

Wait, 1/2.924 is approximately 0.34375 AU. Let me see the options. The options are (1/5) AU, which would be 0.2 AU. But 0.34375 is closer to 1/3, which is 0.3333... So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied Kepler's law. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, I think I did it right. Because the period of Mercury is one fifth of Earth's, so the ratio is 5:1. So the semi-major axis is inversely related. So a_mercury is (1/5)^(3/2) times Earth's a. Wait, wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think. The formula is T² = (4π²/G(M)) a³. So T^2 is proportional to a^3. So, T_earth^2 / T_mercury^2 = a_earth^3 / a_mercury^3.

But T_earth is 1 year, T_mercury is 1/5 year. So T_earth / T_mercury = 5. So (T_earth / T_mercury)^2 = 25. So 25 = (a_earth^3) / (a_mercury^3). So a_mercury^3 = a_earth^3 /25. So a_mercury = a_earth / (25)^(1/3). 

As earlier, a_earth is 1 AU. So a_mercury is 1/ (cube root of 25). Cube root of 25 is about 2.924, so a_mercury is about 0.34375 AU. Hmm, but the answer options don't include that. Let me check the options again.

The options are: A: 1/2, B:1/4, C:1/25, D:1/9, E:1/5, F:1/3, G:1/15, H:1/7, I:1/10, J:1/20.

Wait, none of these are about 0.34. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Mercury's orbit is much larger. Wait, no, the opposite. Mercury is closer than Earth's orbit—no, wait, Earth's is 1 AU, Mercury's is about 0.39 AU. Oh, right, Mercury's distance is approximately 0.387 AU.

Wait, so 0.387 is approximately 1/2.58, which is approximately 1/2.6, which is roughly 1/3. So looking at the options, F is 1/3, which is about 0.3333, which is close to Mercury's actual average distance of about 0.387 AU. So perhaps the question is using approximate values.

Wait, but the question says Mercury's orbital period is about one-fifth of Earth's. But according to Kepler's law, a is proportional to T^(2/3). So if T is 1/5, then a is (1/5)^(2/3) times Earth's a. Let's compute that.

(1/5)^(2/3) is equal to cube root of (1/5)^2. Cube root of (1/25) is about 0.342, which matches the actual average distance of Mercury at about 0.387 AU. Hmm, but the answer options don't include 0.342. So perhaps the question is approximating.

Wait, the question is asking for Mercury's distance. So the actual average is about 0.387 AU, which is approximately 1/2.58 AU. Looking at the options, option F is 1/3 AU (0.333), which is a bit less, but perhaps the intended answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps if I use the exact ratio. Wait, another approach: The actual orbital periods. Earth's period is one year, Mercury's is 1/5 year. So the ratio of periods is 5:1. So the semi-major axis ratio is (T_earth / T_mercury)^(2/3) = (5)^(2/3). So cube root of 5 is about 1.710. So 5^(2/3) is (5^(1/3))^2 = approx 1.71^2 = approx 2.924.

So a_mercury = a_earth / 2.924. So a_earth is 1 AU, so a_mercury is 1/2.924 ≈ 0.343. 

Looking at the options, the closest is F, 1/3 AU (≈0.333). Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the inverse cube of 5. So maybe the correct answer is F.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a_mercury ≈ 0.343 AU, which is approximately 1/2.924. None of the options exactly match that. Let me check the options again.

Options list: J is 1/20 AU, which is 0.05, which is much smaller. So that's not right. Option F is 1/3, which is about 0.333. So Mercury's average distance is approximately 0.343, which is closer to 0.333 than to 0.333. So perhaps the intended answer is F.

But wait, another thought: Kepler's third law is: (T^2) / (a^3) = constant for same star. So T_earth² / a_earth³ = T_mercury² / a_mercury³. So T_mercury = T_earth /5. So ( (1/5)² ) / a_mercury³ = (1²)/ (1)^3.

So 1/(25 a_mercury³) = 1. Therefore, a_mercury³ = 1/25. So a_mercury = (1/25)^(1/3) ≈ 0.342. So the correct answer is approximately 0.342 AU. None of the options match this exactly. So perhaps the intended answer is F: 1/3 AU.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to use the ratio of 5:1, so a_mercury is (1/5)^(3/2) = 1/(5^(3/2)) = 1/(sqrt(125)) = 1/(5 * sqrt(5)) ) = 1/(5 *2.236) ≈ 1/(11.18) ≈ 0.0897 AU. No, that can't be right because Mercury's average distance is about 0.387 AU.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correct formula is a³ ∝ T². So T is inversely proportional to a^(2/3). So if T_mercury is 1/5 of Earth's, then a_mercury = a_earth * (T_earth / T_mercury)^(2/3). So a_mercury = 1 * (5)^(2/3). 

5^(2/3) is cube root of 25, which is about 2.924. So a_mercury ≈ 0.342 AU. Which is approximately 1/2.924 AU.

Looking at the options, the closest is F: 1/3 AU (0.333), which is 0.0007 AU less than Mercury's distance. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is testing the inverse ratio. So if Earth's period is T, Mercury's is T/5. So (T)^2 / (T/5)^2 = T² * 25 / T² =25.

So (a_earth)^3 / (a_mercury)^3 = 25. So a_mercury = a_earth / cube_root(25) ≈ (1) / 2.924 ≈ 0.342.

So Mercury is about 1/3 AU away. So option F.
</think>

Mercury orbits the Sun much more slowly than Earth, with an orbital period of approximately one-fifth of Earth's year. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, the ratio of the semi-major axes of Mercury's and Earth's orbits can be determined. Specifically, the orbital period ratio is 5:1 (Earth to Mercury), so the semi-major axis ratio is proportional to \( (5)^{2/3} \). 

Calculating \( (5)^{2/3} \) gives approximately 2.924. Thus, Mercury's semi-major axis is about \( 1 / 2.924 \approx 0.342 \) AU. Comparing this to the answer choices:

- **Option F (1/3 AU)** is the closest approximation to Mercury's average distance from the Sun, which is approximately 0.342 AU.

Therefore, the correct answer is **F: (1/3) AU**.
