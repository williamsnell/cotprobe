Question:

A biology student from Nebraska, vacationing at a Virginia beach, observes that the level of activity of a fiddler crab changes with the cycle of the tides. When he brings some crabs back with him to Nebraska, he notices that a similar activity cycle is shown, yet there are no ocean beaches for miles. Explain.

Options:

A: The crab's activity cycle is influenced by barometric pressure changes
B: The crab's activity cycle is synchronized with the coastal tides they were originally exposed to
C: The crab's activity cycle is determined by the moon's gravitational pull
D: The crab's activity is random and shows no particular cycle
E: The crab's activity cycle is affected by the local environment
F: The crab's activity cycle is determined by artificial lighting conditions
G: The crab's activity cycle adapts to the nearest body of freshwater
H: The crab's activity cycle is influenced by the presence of sand
I: The crab's activity cycle is determined by the water level
J: The crab's activity cycle is set by the day-night cycle and unaffected by tidal patterns

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this biology question about fiddler crabs and their activity cycles. Let's see. The question says a student from Nebraska saw crabs when he brought them back, but the crabs have an activity cycle similar to what's found in the ocean, yet there are no ocean beaches for miles. Hmm.

I remember that tidal patterns are crucial for the reproduction and survival of many marine organisms. Fiddler crabs, I think, are part of the family Chrysodon and are commonly found along the coast. They probably rely on the moon's gravitational pull to cycle through different behaviors.

The question is asking why the crabs show an activity cycle similar to the tides but without ocean beaches. That makes me think about the connection between tidal patterns and their behavior. The crabs might be responding to the same tidal rhythms as their natural environment.

Looking at the options, option B says the activity cycle is synchronized with the coastal tides. That makes sense because tidal patterns influence how the crabs move and behave. Without the actual tides (like the ocean's), the crabs won't show the same cycle. So the answer would be B.

Other options don't quite fit. Option A mentions barometric pressure, which I don't think is relevant here. Barometric changes are more about air pressure, not biological cycles. Option C is about the moon's gravity, which is a good point, but the question is about the crabs' own behavior, not external forces. Option D says random, which doesn't make sense. Option E talks about local environment, which could include tides, but not sure. Option F is about lighting, which doesn't seem related. Option G is about adaptation to freshwater, but I don't think so. Option H is about day-night, which is more about animals' circadian rhythms, not tides. Option I is about water level, which might be part of tidal patterns. So I think B and I are close. But the question is about the crabs' own behavior, so B is more accurate.

So the correct answer should be B: The crab's activity cycle is synchronized with the coastal tides they were originally exposed to.

The correct answer is B: The crab's activity cycle is synchronized with the coastal tides they were originally exposed to. The fiddler crabs exhibit an activity cycle similar to tidal patterns, indicating that their behavior is influenced by the same gravitational forces that drive the tides. This explains why, even without ocean beaches, these crabs can maintain a cycle of activity.

Answer: B
