The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

When a person invents a new product, he is often granted a patent which is intended to protect his idea from being stolen by others. Explain how the issuance of patents fosters the growth of monopoly.

Options:

A: Patents have no effect on monopoly.
B: Patents are awarded to multiple inventors for the same idea, fostering competition rather than monopoly.
C: Patents ensure that only government-owned companies can become monopolies.
D: Patents grant exclusive rights for a short period, after which a monopoly is impossible.
E: Patents allow for an unlimited number of competitors, preventing any form of monopoly.
F: Patents hinder the growth of a monopoly.
G: Patents require the inventor to share the idea with the public, which leads to increased competition and no monopoly.
H: Patents always lead to monopoly.
I: A patent, as a barrier to entry, may cause a monopoly to arise.
J: Patents provide temporary monopoly rights which can be easily bypassed by competitors.

Okay, so I have this question about patents and monopolies. Hmm, I remember that patents are granted to protect certain ideas, right? And they're meant to prevent others from stealing them. But the question is about how patent issuance fosters the growth of a monopoly. Let me think about the options given.

Option A says patents have no effect on monopoly. That doesn't sound right. I know that patents can help protect intellectual property, which can lead to more competition. But wait, how does that tie into a monopoly? Monopolies require exclusive rights for a long time. I think that when a company has a patent, they can create something, but others can't easily copy it as long as they don't infringe and get a patent themselves. So that would allow more competition, not a monopoly. So A might not be correct.

Option B claims patents are awarded to multiple inventors for the same idea, fostering competition. Wait, isn't one patent granted to each person who invents the same idea? Like, each person gets a separate patent? So this option says multiple inventors get the same patent, which might not be right. Because I think each person gets one patent, not multiple. So B might be incorrect.

Option C: Patents ensure only government-owned companies can become monopolies. No, that doesn't make sense. Monopolies can come from any company, not just government ones. Even big corporations can have patents that protect their ideas, which could lead to monopolies. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Patents grant exclusive rights for a short period, preventing a monopoly. Wait, actually, the length of the patent's protection is a key point. If it's granted for a short period, maybe that allows for more competition, but doesn't necessarily prevent a monopoly. Or does it? Maybe if the patent is long-term, it could create a monopoly. Or perhaps the opposite. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: Patents can protect a company's ability to make a product, which might prevent others from competing directly. But if the patent is in place, others might be able to enter and compete, which could lead to a monopoly. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Patents allow unlimited competitors, preventing a monopoly. That doesn't sound right. If a company has a patent, it can't be easily copied, but that doesn't necessarily mean more competitors can't come in. In fact, many companies do enter the market and then use patents to protect their products. So E seems incorrect.

Option F: Patents hinder the growth of a monopoly. That could be possible. If a company has a patent, it could limit their ability to enter new markets or enter new technologies, which might prevent a monopoly from forming. So F might be correct.

Option G: Patents require the inventor to share the idea with the public, leading to competition. Wait, I think that's the case for antitrust laws. If a company shares their idea with the public, it can cause more competition because more companies are looking at the same market. So this doesn't directly relate to the patent fostering a monopoly. So G might not be correct.

Option H: Patents always lead to a monopoly. No, that's not right. Patents can lead to monopolies, but they can also allow for other remedies, like anti-competitive practices. So H is incorrect.

Option I: A patent as a barrier to entry, leading to a monopoly. That seems correct. If a company has a patent, it can protect its production process, which makes it harder for others to enter the market. This limits competition, allowing a company to become a monopoly. So I seems correct.

Option J: Patents make it easy for competitors to take over. No, that's the opposite. If a company has a patent, it might restrict others from copying their technology, which could allow more competition. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so looking back, the question is about how patent issuance fosters the growth of a monopoly. Let me think again. A patent grants exclusive rights for a period, but doesn't necessarily prevent a company from forming a monopoly. Or perhaps it does?

Wait, if a company is granted a patent, it can protect its market position. So if there are other companies, they can't easily exploit the patent. That might prevent other companies from entering the market, which would lead to a monopoly. Alternatively, if a company can't enter the market as easily, it can become a dominant player, a monopoly.

So in that case, option I says that a patent as a barrier to entry may allow a company to become a monopoly. So if the patent allows a company to protect its market, then it can't be easily replicated, which would lead to a monopoly. That makes sense. So option I would be correct.

Wait, but option F says that patents hinder the growth of a monopoly. So why would that be the case? I'm a bit confused. Let me think about it. Monopolies are about having exclusive rights for a period. If the rights are for a short time, maybe that's easier to have. But if a company can't enter the market easily, maybe the market can't grow, leading to a monopoly. Alternatively, if the rights are long-term, it might prevent other companies from entering, leading to a monopoly. So I think option I is correct.

Alternatively, let me think about the options. Option E says that patents allow unlimited competitors, which is incorrect. So E is wrong.

So the best option is I. Because a patent as a barrier to entry may prevent new competitors from entering the market, allowing a single company to become a monopoly.

The correct answer is:

**I: A patent, as a barrier to entry, may cause a monopoly to arise.**

**Explanation:**
Patents grant exclusive rights to companies for a specific period, often preventing others from easily entering the market. If a company has a patent, it can protect its production process, making it difficult for competitors to exploit this technology. This barrier to entry limits competition, allowing a company to become a monopoly, where it has the ability to control the market for a period. Thus, a patent can foster the growth of a monopoly by restricting new competitors.
