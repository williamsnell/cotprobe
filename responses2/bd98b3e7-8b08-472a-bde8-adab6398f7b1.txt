Question:

Lore Ltd. estimates that its dividend growth will be 13% per year for the next five years. It will then settle to a sustainable, constant, and continuing rate of 5%. Let’s say that the current year’s dividend is $14 and the required rate of return (or discount rate) is 12%. What is the current fair value of Lore Ltd. stock?

D: 265.50
E: 325.60
F: 315.75
G: 300.00

J: 360.40

Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the current fair value of Lore Ltd. stock. Hmm, let me think. I remember something about dividend discount models. Oh right, the Gordon Growth Model or the constant growth model might apply here, but wait, there's also the possibility of a supernormal growth phase since the dividend is expected to grow at 13% for the next five years.

So, let me break it down. The current dividend is $14. The growth rate for the next five years is 13%, and then it settles to a constant 5%. The required rate of return is 12%. I need to find the stock's current fair value.

First step: calculate the dividends for each of the next five years. Then, find the present value of those dividends. After that, calculate the present value of the stock price at the end of year five, using the constant growth formula, and add all those values together.

Calculating the dividends:

Year 1: 14 * 1.13 = 15.82
Year 2: 15.82 * 1.13 = let's see, 15.82*1.13. Let me do that: 15.82 * 1 =15.82, 15.82 *0.13= ~2.0566, so total is 17.8766.
Year 3: 17.8766 *1.13. 17.8766 *1=17.8766, 0.13*17.8766≈2.324, so total ~20.2006.
Year 4: 20.2006 *1.13. 20.2006 *1=20.2006, 0.13*20.2006≈2.626, so ~22.826.
Year 5: 22.826 *1.13. 22.826 *1=22.826, 0.13*22.826≈2.967, so ~25.793.

Okay, so those are the dividends for the first five years. Now, I need to find their present values. The required rate is 12%, so each dividend is discounted back to present.

PV1 = 15.82 / (1.12)^1 = 15.82 /1.12 ≈ 14.15

PV2 = 17.8766 / (1.12)^2. Let's compute 1.12 squared: 1.2544. So 17.8766 /1.2544 ≈14.25.

PV3 =20.2006 / (1.12)^3. 1.12^3 is about 1.4049. 20.2006 /1.4049 ≈14.37.

PV4 =22.826 / (1.12)^4. 1.12^4 is approximately 1.5735. 22.826 /1.5735≈14.50.

PV5 =25.793 / (1.12)^5. 1.12^5 is about 1.7623. 25.793 /1.7623≈14.58.

Now, adding those up: 14.15 +14.25=28.4; +14.37=42.77; +14.5=57.27; +14.58=71.85. So the total PV of the first five dividends is approximately $71.85.

Next, we need to find the stock price at the end of year five. At that point, the company is in a constant growth phase with a growth rate of 5%. So the formula for the terminal value (TV) at year five is:

TV = D6 / (r - g), where D6 is the dividend at year six.

D6 is D5 * (1 + g). D5 is 25.793, so 25.793 *1.05=27.087.

TV =27.087 / (0.12 -0.05) =27.087 /0.07≈386.957.

Now, we need to find the present value of this TV, which is at year five. So:

PV_TV = 386.957 / (1.12)^5.

We know 1.12^5 is ~1.7623. So 386.957 /1.7623 ≈219.70.

So adding the present value of the TV, which is ~219.70, to the previous sum of 71.85 gives us the total fair value.

71.85 +219.70=291.55.

Looking at the options, option I is 291.45, which is very close to 291.55, probably due to rounding. The other options are around 245, 265, etc., which are lower. So the closest is I: 291.45.

To determine the current fair value of Lore Ltd. stock, we use a two-stage dividend discount model: the first five years with a 13% growth rate, followed by a constant 5% growth rate. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Calculate the dividends for the next five years:**
   - **Year 1:** $14 * 1.13 = $15.82
   - **Year 2:** $15.82 * 1.13 ≈ $17.88
   - **Year 3:** $17.88 * 1.13 ≈ $20.20
   - **Year 4:** $20.20 * 1.13 ≈ $22.82
   - **Year 5:** $22.82 * 1.13 ≈ $25.79

2. **Present Value of Dividends (PV of Dividends):**
   - Calculate the present value of each dividend using the required rate of return (12%):
     - PV1 = $15.82 / 1.12 ≈ $14.15
     - PV2 = $17.88 / (1.12^2) ≈ $14.25
     - PV3 = $20.20 / (1.12^3) ≈ $14.37
     - PV4 = $22.82 / (1.12^4) ≈ $14.50
     - PV5 = $25.79 / (1.12^5) ≈ $14.58
   - Total PV of dividends ≈ $14.15 + $14.25 + $14.37 + $14.50 + $14.58 ≈ $71.85

3. **Terminal Value (TV) at Year 5:**
   - Calculate the dividend for Year 6 ($D6 = D5 * 1.05 = $27.087):
   - TV = $27.087 / (0.12 - 0.05) ≈ $386.96

4. **Present Value of Terminal Value (PV_TV):**
   - PV_TV = $386.96 / (1.12^5) ≈ $386.96 / 1.7623 ≈ $219.70

5. **Total Fair Value:**
   - Sum the present value of dividends and the present value of terminal value:
     - Total Fair Value ≈ $71.85 + $219.70 ≈ $291.55

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The closest option is **I: $291.45**.
