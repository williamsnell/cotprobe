Okay, so I've got this equation here: 12 minus 9 plus c equals 12. I need to find the value of c that makes this equation true. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I'll rewrite the equation to make it clearer. So, it's 12 - 9 + c = 12. I should probably simplify the left side first before trying to isolate c.

Let me compute 12 minus 9. 12 minus 9 is 3. So now the equation becomes 3 + c = 12. That simplifies things a bit.

Now, I need to solve for c. To get c by itself, I'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. So, subtracting 3 from both sides gives me c = 12 - 3. 

Calculating that, 12 minus 3 equals 9. So, c should be 9. Let me check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me go through it again. Starting with 12 - 9 + c = 12. Subtracting 9 from 12 gives 3, so 3 + c = 12. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives c = 9. Yep, that seems correct.

Looking at the options provided, option I is 9. So the answer should be I.

The equation simplifies to 3 + c = 12, so c must be 9. The correct answer is I.

Answer: I
