Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically dealing with Sylow theorems and Abelian groups. Let me try to break it down step by step. So the question includes two statements and four options (A to J) about their truthfulness.

Statement 1 says that every group of order p² where p is prime is Abelian. Hmm, I remember that p² is a prime squared. So groups of order p² have certain properties. Let me think about the possible structures of such groups.

Since p is prime, the order of the group is p squared. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible subgroups have orders dividing p², so 1, p, and p². I recall that for groups of order p², they are either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p. Wait, but if a group has order p², then it has a unique Sylow p-subgroup, which would be cyclic of order p². Alternatively, it could be the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.

Wait, the Klein four-group is Abelian, yeah. Because every element has order 2, so the group operation is commutative. So if a group of order p² is either the cyclic group of order p², which is Abelian, or the Klein four-group (which is also Abelian), then Statement 1 would be true. Because both possibilities result in Abelian groups. So Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2 says: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is normal in G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G. Wait, I remember that Sylow theorems give conditions for the number of Sylow p-subgroups. Specifically, the number of Sylow p-subgroups, n_p, satisfies two conditions: n_p divides the order of the group, and n_p ≡ 1 mod p.

So, if a Sylow p-subgroup is unique (n_p = 1), then it is normal because all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, and if there's only one, it's fixed by conjugation. Conversely, if it's normal, then it must be the unique Sylow p-subgroup because any other Sylow p-subgroup would be conjugate to it, which would mean they are equal, hence unique. So yes, the statement is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the converse. If n_p = 1, then all Sylow p-subgroups are that one, so it's unique. And if n_p = 1, then it's normal. So the statement is correct: a Sylow p-subgroup is normal ⇨ it's the unique Sylow p-subgroup. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait a second. Or is that the other way around? If a Sylow p-subgroup is normal, is it the only Sylow p-subgroup? Or is it the other way around? I think the theorem says that if n_p = 1, then it's the only Sylow p-subgroup. So the statement says that it's normal if and only if it's the only Sylow p-subgroup. So the if and only if part is correct.

Wait, but the theorem does say that if a Sylow p-subgroup is normal, then it's the only Sylow p-subgroup. Because if n_p =1, then it's unique and hence normal. So the converse is also true: if it's the only Sylow p-subgroup, then it's normal. So Statement 2 is correct. So both statements are true.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Statement 2 says: (for a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of G is normal iff it's the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.)

Wait, so the equivalence is: the Sylow p-subgroup is normal ⇨ it's the only Sylow p-subgroup, and the converse: if it's the only Sylow p-subgroup, then it's normal.

So, if n_p=1, then the Sylow p-subgroup is normal. Because all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, and if there's only one, then it's fixed. So yes, that part is correct. So the statement is correct.

Therefore, both statements are true. So looking at the options, E says True, True. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Statement 1: All groups of order p² are abelian. I think that's right because p² has so few divisors. The possible group structures are either cyclic (which is Abelian) or the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p (which is Abelian). So yes, both cases are Abelian. So Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup is normal iff it's the only Sylow p-subgroup. Which is correct because of the Sylow theorems. So yes, both statements are true. So the answer is E.

The question evaluates two statements about group theory:

1. **Statement 1**: Every group of order \( p^2 \) (where \( p \) is prime) is Abelian.  
   - Since groups of order \( p^2 \) are either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order \( p \), both of which are Abelian, this statement is true.

2. **Statement 2**: For a fixed prime \( p \), a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup of a group \( G \) is normal in \( G \) if and only if it is the only Sylow \( p \)-subgroup of \( G \).  
   - By Sylow's theorems, if a Sylow \( p \)-subgroup is unique (\( n_p = 1 \)), it is normal and hence the only such subgroup. Conversely, if it is normal, it must be unique. Thus, this statement is also true.

Both statements are true, so the correct option is E.
