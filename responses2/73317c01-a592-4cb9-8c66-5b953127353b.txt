Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Moche. Hmm, I remember that the Moche is a city in the Aztec Empire, right? It was located on the Tiwi River. I'm trying to recall what the Moche was built for. 

I think it was a significant center, maybe for trade or something. I've heard terms like "market" or "city" before in this context. Oh wait, I remember something about an amphitheater. Oh right, the Moche was known for its impressive architecture and was a hub for trade and commerce. They had a marketplace, which they called an amphitheater, I believe. So that would be option E.

Wait, let me double-check. The Moche was built as a place for trade and as a complex of temples and workshops. The amphitheater was a large building used for concerts and shows. The other options don't seem right. A temple, a complex of temples, or artisan workshops were probably more specific. An irrigation system (D), a library (G), or a marketplace (E) feels more accurate here.

So the answer should be E, the amphitheater for gladiatorial combats. Yeah, that makes sense.

The correct answer is E, the amphitheater for gladiatorial combats. This reflects the Moche's role as a trade hub, known for its large, open spaces used for events like gladiatorial shows.

Answer: E
