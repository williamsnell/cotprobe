Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Yang-shao sites in China. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to piece this together. Let's see.

The question is asking about the domesticated crops that were excavated from those sites. The options are A to J, each listing different crops. I need to figure out which ones are correct.

First, I remember that Yang-shao sites are part of China's ancient history, especially around the Tang and Sino-Buddhist periods. They were important for agriculture because they were used for constructing roads and water systems, and they held significant cultural and religious importance.

I think the Yang-shoys were known for domesticating crops like sorghum and millet. Millet was also domesticated, and there's something about beans too, but I'm not sure. Wait, beans are legumes, which I think were domesticated as well. Oh right, beans were domesticated in China, especially in the Yang-shoys.

So, looking at the options, let's go through them. Option F says sorghum, emmer, and legumes. Emmer wasn't domesticated in the Yang-shoys, right? Emmer was more from the Near East. Legumes, like beans, were definitely domesticated. So F includes sorghum and legumes, but emmer is not. So F is probably incorrect.

Option J is beans, millet, and maize. Maize is millet, so J includes those. But beans are legumes, so they were domesticated, not millet. So J might not be correct because beans are different from millet.

Option G is maize, cabbage, and peas. Maize is millet, which is domesticated. Peas are legumes, like beans. Cabbage is a legume too. So G includes legumes and one plant that's not domesticated, which is cabbage. So G is mostly legumes, but perhaps not all.

Option B is soybeans, emmer, and rice. Soybeans are legumes, emmer isn't domesticated, rice isn't either. So B is out.

Option C: millet, barley, and maize. Barley and maize are domesticated, but millet is also domesticated. However, the question is about which crops were excavated. So if all three are domesticated, then C is correct. But did the Yang-shoys import these? I think they were domesticated, especially sorghum and millet. Barley is a legume, which was domesticated, so C might be a possibility.

Option D: wheat, rice, and peas. Wheat is a grain, but rice and peas are legumes. So D's incorrect because wheat is a grain, not domesticated, and the others are legumes.

Option A: barley, lentils, and peas. Barley and peas are legumes; lentils were domesticated in ancient times as well, but I'm not sure if they were domesticated in the Yang-shoys.

Wait, the Yang-shoys are known for domesticating sorghum and millet. Millet is a plant, so I think millet is definitely domesticated. Barley was domesticated in China, especially the Yang-shoys, but I'm not certain. Lentils were domesticated in ancient times, so maybe they were domesticated in the earlier Tang period but perhaps not in the Yang-shoys. Peas are legumes, like beans.

So, looking back at the options, the correct ones would be millet (millet is also millet), sorghum, and perhaps beans (legumes). So option C has millet, barley, and maize. But if the question is about domesticated crops, then all three would be domesticated. So C might be correct.

Alternatively, another thought: the Yang-shoys were known for domesticating sorghum and millet. Barley was domesticated as well, but I think sorghum and millet were more prominent. So option C includes millet (millet), which is domesticated; barley and maize (maize, which is also millet), which are domesticated. So C is correct.

Another angle: the Yang-shoys were also known for domesticating legumes. So the correct answer would include beans, sorghum, and millet. Option J includes beans and millet, but also includes legumes (like beans, sorghum, and legumes) but omits something else. Wait, J says beans, millet, and maize. Maize is millet, so that's correct. Beans are legumes, which are domesticated. So J includes beans, millet (maize), and maize. Wait, that's a typo because maize is millet. So J is beans, millet, and maize. That would mean beans (domesticated), millet (domesticated), and maize (domesticated). So J has all three as domesticated.

But earlier, I thought that sorghum and millet were domesticated, and beans are. So option J includes beans, millet (maize), and maize (maize again). So all three are domesticated. So J is correct?

Wait, but sorghum is a distinct crop, and it's a wild crop in some parts, but domesticated in China. So if J includes beans, millet, and maize, which are all domesticated, then J is correct. But earlier I thought that the correct answer might be C, which includes millet, barley, and maize.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The question asks which crops were domesticated from the sites. So the correct answer should have all three as domesticated.

Option C: millet, barley, and maize. Maize is millet. So all three are domesticated. So C is correct.

But wait, the original question says which domesticated crops? So if the correct ones are millet, which is both millet and maize, then C includes all three as domesticated.

Alternatively, another angle: the Yang-shoys were known for domesticating sorghum and millet, and beans. So the correct answer would include those. So looking at the options, option F says sorghum, emmer, and legumes. Emmer isn't domesticated in the Yang-shoys, so F is incorrect. Option J is beans, millet, and maize. So J includes beans (domesticated), millet (domesticated), and maize (domesticated). So J seems correct.

But earlier, I thought C is correct because it includes all three as domesticated. So perhaps both C and J are correct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, what's the difference between beans and sorghum? I think beans are a different plant altogether. So if the question is about domesticated crops, beans would be correct, but sorghum and millet would also be correct. So C includes all three as domesticated.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall: in the Yang-shoys, which crops were domesticated? I think millet was domesticated, sorghum, and beans. So C would include millet (maize), which is domesticated, and beans, which are legumes. So C is correct.

Wait, but what about option J? J includes beans, millet, and maize. So that's beans (domesticated), millet (domesticated), and maize (domesticated). So that would be correct as well, assuming all three are domesticated.

Wait, but if the answer is among the options, then perhaps both C and J are correct. But the options are A to J, and the correct answer is only one. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about the types. Legumes are beans, lentils, peas, etc. Millet is a distinct plant. Sorghum is a wild crop, but domesticated in China. So the Yang-shoys did domesticate sorghum and millet, and beans.

So option C: millet, barley, and maize. So all three are domesticated. So C is correct.

Option J: beans, millet, and maize. All three are domesticated. So J is also correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which domesticated crops were excavated. So all three in each option. So both C and J are correct. But the options don't have an 'both' choice. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

C: millet, barley, and maize.

J: beans, millet, and maize.

So, do beans and sorghum count as domesticated? Yes. So option J includes beans, which were domesticated in the Yang-shoys.

Wait, another thought: I'm pretty sure that the Yang-shoys were known for domesticating sorghum and millet, and beans. So option J includes beans, millet, and maize. So that would be correct.

But earlier I thought option C is correct. I'm getting conflicting information.

Wait, another approach: the Yang-shoys, also known as Yangshan, were one of the earliest urban centers in China. They were important for agriculture, urban development, and religious purposes.

In terms of domesticated crops, I believe that millet (maize) and sorghum were domesticated there. Also, beans were domesticated, as were lentils and peas.

So option C includes millet, barley, and maize. barley is a legume, which was domesticated in ancient times but perhaps not in the Yang-shoys. So if the question is about domesticated crops, then option C includes beans (legumes, domesticated), millet (domesticated), and maize (domesticated). So C would be correct.

Alternatively, option J includes beans, millet, and maize (maize). So both J and C have all three as domesticated.

Wait, but I think beans are a different plant from sorghum and millet. So if the question is about which domesticated crops, then all three must be domesticated. So option J includes beans (domesticated), maize/millet (domesticated), and perhaps another one, but that's all three.

Wait, I'm getting really confused. Let me think again.

The question is about which domesticated crops were excavated. So the correct answer must be a group of three domesticated crops.

Looking at the answer options:

Option C: millet, barley, and maize. All three are domesticated. So that's correct.

Option J: beans, millet, and maize. All three are domesticated. So that's also correct.

But the options don't have both, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another point: I think sorghum was domesticated, and so was millet. Barley was domesticated too. So C includes all three, which are correct.

Therefore, option C is correct. So the answer would be C.

The question asks which domesticated crops were excavated from Yang-shao sites in China. Yang-shao sites are part of ancient China's agricultural and religious history, known for domesticating crops such as sorghum and millet, and legumes like beans and peas. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Barley and peas are legumes, but soybeans are legumes as well, making this option incorrect.
- **Option B**: Soybeans and rice are legumes, and emmer is a wild crop, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Millet (maize), barley, and maize (maize) are all domesticated crops. Millet and maize (maize) were domesticated in the Yang-shoys, making this option correct.
- **Option D**: Wheat is a grain, not a domesticated crop, and rice and peas are legumes, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option E**: Sorghum and millet are domesticated, but rice is a legume, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option F**: Emmer and sorghum are not domesticated in the Yang-shoys, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option G**: Cabbage is a legume, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option H**: Wheat is a grain, not a domesticated crop, and legumes are domesticated, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option I**: Maize (millet) and cabbage are legumes, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option J**: Beans are legumes, millet (maize) is domesticated, and maize (maize) is domesticated, making this option correct.

Between options C and J, both include three domesticated crops. However, the question specifies "domesticated crops," and millet (maize) and maize (maize) are the same plant. Therefore, option C is the most accurate because it includes all three domesticated crops (millet, barley, and maize) that were excavated from Yang-shao sites.

ANSWER: C
