Okay, so I'm looking at this linear algebra problem. The question is about a linear transformation P on a finite-dimensional real vector space V, and it's given that P squared equals P, so P² = P. The question is about which of the statements I, II, III must be true, and then choosing the correct option from A to J.

Let me break this down. I remember that when you have a linear transformation P such that P squared equals P, that makes P an idempotent transformation. I'm a bit fuzzy on the properties of idempotent matrices, but I think they have something to do with projections or something like that.

Statement I says P is invertible. Hmm. For a matrix to be invertible, its determinant must be non-zero. But wait, if P² = P, then applying P twice is the same as applying it once. So, P² - P = 0, which factors into P(P - I) = 0. So, the minimal polynomial of P divides x(x-1), which suggests that the eigenvalues of P can only be 0 or 1. 

But invertibility isn't just about eigenvalues being non-zero. The determinant is the product of eigenvalues. If P is diagonalizable, its determinant could be zero (if at least one eigenvalue is zero) or non-zero (if all eigenvalues are 1). But if P isn't diagonalizable, its determinant could be zero even if it's idempotent. Wait, but is that the case? Let me think. If P² = P, then P is a projection. The projection can be diagonalizable if it's onto a subspace, but if it's the zero or identity, it's not invertible.

Wait, no. For example, consider a projection onto a line in 2D space. It's a 2x2 matrix where P² = P. Its determinant is zero because the rank is less than 2. So in that case, it's not invertible. So statement I says P is invertible, which is not necessarily true. So I is false.

Statement II: P is diagonalizable. I remember that a matrix is diagonalizable if there exists a basis consisting of its eigenvectors. For idempotent matrices, the minimal polynomial is x(x-1), so they are similar to a diagonal matrix with 0s and 1s on the diagonal. So yes, they can be diagonalized. So statement II is true.

Statement III: P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. For instance, suppose V is two-dimensional, and P is a projection onto a one-dimensional subspace. Then P is idempotent, but P isn't the identity or zero transformation. So statement III is false.

So now, let's evaluate the options.

Option A: None are true. But we know II is true, so A is wrong.

Option B: II only. That's correct because II is true, I is false, III is false.

Option C: I and II only. Well, II is true, but I is false, so C is wrong.

Option D: I only. No, because I is false, so D is wrong.

Option E: I and III only. I is false, so E is wrong.

Option F: Only I and II are false. Wait, no. I is false, II is true, III is false. So only I and III are false, but II is true. So F says only I and II are false. Which would mean II is false, but II is true. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Only I and II are false. Well, I is false, II is true, III is false. So G is incorrect because II is true.

Option H: III only. III is false, so H is incorrect.

Option I: II and III only. But II is true and III is false. So I is incorrect.

Option J: All of the above. Since I is false, J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be B: II only.
</think>

The correct answer is B: II only.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a linear transformation \( P \) on a finite-dimensional real vector space \( V \), with \( P^2 = P \).
   - We need to determine which of the statements I, II, III must be true.

2. **Analyzing Statement I: Invertibility**
   - \( P \) being invertible means its determinant is non-zero.
   - Since \( P^2 = P \), the minimal polynomial of \( P \) divides \( x(x-1) \), so eigenvalues are 0 or 1.
   - If there's a non-trivial Jordan block (like projection onto a line in 2D space), \( P \) is not invertible. Thus, invertibility is not guaranteed. Statement I is false.

3. **Analyzing Statement II: Diagonalizability**
   - \( P \) is idempotent. Such matrices can be diagonalized because they are similar to a diagonal matrix with 0s and 1s.
   - Example: Projection matrices are diagonalizable. Statement II is true.

4. **Analyzing Statement III: Identity or Zero Transformation**
   - Not all idempotent transformations are identity or zero. For instance, a projection onto a one-dimensional subspace is idempotent but neither identity nor zero. Statement III is false.

5. **Evaluating Options:**
   - **A:** Incorrect because I is false.
   - **B:** Correct (only II is true).
   - **C:** Incorrect because I is false.
   - **D:** Incorrect because I is false.
   - **E:** Incorrect because I is false.
   - **F:** Incorrect because I is false.
   - **G:** Incorrect because I is false.
   - **H:** Incorrect because III is false.
   - **I:** Incorrect because II is true but III is false.
   - **J:** Incorrect because I is false.

**Answer:** B: II only
