Question:

Another application of the relationship given in Problem $1-48$ has to do with the excitedstate energies and lifetimes of atoms and molecules. If we know that the lifetime of an excited state is $10^{-9} \mathrm{~s}$, then what is the uncertainty in the energy of this state?


Options:

A: 2 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
B: 4 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
C:  7 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
D: 6 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
E: 5 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
F: 9 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
G: 3 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
H: 8 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
I: 11 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$
J: 1 $10^{-25} \mathrm{~J}$

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty in energy due to the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the time an excited state exists is given, and I need to find the uncertainty in its energy.

Wait, the problem says the lifetime is 1e-9 seconds. Oh right, the uncertainty principle relates energy and time. The formula is ΔE = h/(Δt), where h is Planck's constant. But wait, I should get the exact value right.

Planck's constant h is 6.626 x10^-34 J·s, right? And since the uncertainty in time Δt is given as 1e-9 seconds, I can plug those numbers into the equation.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.626e-25 J. Wait, but the options don't have exactly 6.626e-25. Let me look again.

The options are all in the form of 1e-25 or similar. Option F is 9e-25, D is 6e-25, etc. So my calculation gives approximately 6.6e-25 J, which is closest to option D, which is 6e-25. But wait, wait, sometimes the uncertainty principle uses ħ (h-bar), which is h/(2π). Oh right, because I think the formula sometimes uses ħ in place of h. Let me check that. If it uses ħ, then h/(2π) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let's recalculate using ħ. So ΔE = ħ / Δt = (1.05457e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05457e-25 J. That's approximately 1.05e-25 J. But looking at the options again, none of them are 1e-25, except option E is 5e-25. Wait, but this calculation gives around 1e-25, which isn't one of the options. Hmmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I misremembered the formula. Let me think again. The correct formula is ΔE = h / Δt. So if h is 6.626e-34, then 6.626e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 6.626e-25. So I'm getting about 6.6e-25 J. The closest option would be D:6e-25. But wait, option E is 5e-25, which is lower, D is 6e-25, so I think the answer is D.

Wait, but the original problem statement says "another application" of the relationship. Oh, wait a second, perhaps the uncertainty principle is applied to transitions between states, but I think the main point is the same. So the calculation holds.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔE = (h)/(2πΔt) which would be the same as using ħ. So using ħ, the calculation gives about 1.05e-25 J. But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem expects using h, not ħ. Then the answer is 6.6e-25, which rounds to 7e-25. Looking at the options, option C is 7e-25, which would be the right choice.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2e-25

B:4e-25

C:7e-25

D:6e-25

E:5e-25

F:9e-25

G:3e-25

H:8e-25

I:11e-25

J:1e-25

So if using h, the result is approximately 6.6e-25, which is closest to option D (6e-25). But if using ħ, it's about 1.05e-25, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct way is to use h. So the answer would be 6.6e-25, which is option D. But wait, let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 6.626e-34 divided by 1e-9.

6.626e-34 / 1e-9 = 6.626e-25 J.

So 6.626e-25 is approximately 6.6e-25, which is close to option D (6e-25). So the correct answer should be D.

The problem involves calculating the uncertainty in the energy of an excited state given its lifetime, using the relationship derived from the uncertainty principle. The formula used is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{h}{\Delta t}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the excited state (\( 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1 \times 10^{-9}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]

This value is approximately \( 6.6 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \). Among the given options, the closest match is **option D: \( 6 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \)**. While the exact value is slightly higher (\( 6.6 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \)), option D is the best choice as it is the closest to the calculated value.
