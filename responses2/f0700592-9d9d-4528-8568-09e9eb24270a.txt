Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about intergovernmental organizations, specifically SELDOM. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.

First, I remember that intergovernmental organizations are formal organizations that function between national governments. They play a crucial role in international relations by coordinating policies and ensuring cooperation between nations. I think these organizations are important for handling various international issues like trade agreements, environmental concerns, and economic sanctions.

Looking at the options provided:

A: Implement economic sanctions
B: Provide strong enforcement
C: Regulate international trade
D: Promote global standards
E: Handle disputes between member nations
F: Reduce transaction costs for agreements
G: Monitor parties
H: Facilitate international cooperation
I: Act independently of national governments
J: Provide a forum for discussion

I know that some of these are correct, but I need to figure out which one is specifically about intergovernmental organizations like SELDOM.

Option A is about implementing economic sanctions, which might be done by these organizations. But the question is about what they do, not their specific functions. So it's not necessarily about their role, but perhaps one of their functions.

Option B talks about providing strong enforcement. I'm not sure if that's a primary function of intergovernmental organizations. They might enforce generally, but does that make them a specific function like "provide strong enforcement"?

Option C is about regulating international trade. That sounds more like the role of the United Nations or specialized agencies, but again, not specifically about intergovernmental organizations.

Option D says promoting global standards. I'm not sure if this is a function of the SELDOM structure. It might be more about ensuring that nations align on certain standards, but I'm not certain.

Option E handles disputes between member nations. That rings a bell. I recall that these organizations often resolve disputes between member states, ensuring a common ground.

Option F reduces transaction costs. This seems more about economic efficiency, which might be a function of the structure rather than the organization's primary role.

Option G focuses on monitoring parties, which might involve oversight but isn't a primary function of the SELDOM structure.

Option H facilitates international cooperation. This seems correct. These organizations help coordinate efforts, ensuring that nations work together effectively.

Option I says they act independently. That doesn't sound right. Intergovernmental organizations are not acting on their own; they rely on national governments.

Option J is about providing a forum for discussion. This could be part of their role, but it's not the primary function.

So, considering the options, I think the correct answer is H: Facilitate international cooperation. Because these organizations are meant to coordinate and collaborate between nations, working together to achieve common goals.
