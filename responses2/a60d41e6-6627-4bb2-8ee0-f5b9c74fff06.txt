Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the "no more pernicious doctrine" that Cicero discussed. The question gives me several options, and I need to choose the correct one. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should recall what a "pernicious doctrine" is. From what I remember, a pernicious doctrine is something that promotes harm or unethical behavior. So, Cicero is probably talking about a principle that's not just wrong, but also not just in a negative way. It's a neutral stance, right? Because he's saying you can't have a doctrine that's "no more" than that.

Looking at the options, let's see what each one suggests.

Option A: "It is sometimes necessary to act against one's principles." Hmm, that's a bit vague. It suggests that you have to act contrary to what you believe, but it doesn't necessarily say it's the best approach or that it's neutral. So maybe it's not the perfect answer.

Option B: "It is sometimes permissible to lie." This is interesting because it's about what's allowed. But wait, lying isn't always wrong—it depends on the context. So, lying can be permissible, which makes this option not a neutral doctrine. I don't think this is the right choice.

Option C: "Moral rightness is relative to one’s culture." This seems like a strong point. It's saying that what is right or wrong varies based on cultural context. Cicero was known for his emphasis on the importance of culture in moral reasoning. So this might be the key point he's making here.

Option D: "Moral is subjective and can be changed based on personal preferences." Well, this is a bit conflicting. Changing moral principles based on personal preferences could imply that they are subjective, but also that they can be altered. But this doesn't necessarily negate their inherent subjectivity. It's more about whether they can be changed or not, which might not be the strongest point.

Option E: "A thing may be expedient without being morally right." This aligns with the idea that convenience might not be the same as moral correctness. Cicero might have said something along these lines, like how convenience can be a reason for behavior that's not right, but it's not necessarily the case that it's always doing that.

Option F: "Lying is always morally wrong." No, this is the opposite of what I thought before. Lying is not always wrong, so this is incorrect.

Option G: "One's actions do not have consequences." That's too vague. Actions have consequences, so this doesn't make sense in a neutral way.

Option H: "The gods do not care what we do." This is a universal truth, but it's more about religious beliefs than a doctrine about ethics. So it's not directly related to the point about ethics and subjectivity.

Option I: "There is no absolute truth." This is another neutral stance, but it's more about truth existing independently. It's a broader statement, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

Option J: "The gods are indifferent to human affairs." Again, too vague and related more to religion.

Now, circling back, the question is about a doctrine that's neither justifiable nor pernicious. So, it's a neutral stance. The options that don't suggest any positive or negative action are C and I. But I think the key point is that what's right and wrong can vary culturally.

So, Cicero's "no more pernicious doctrine" would likely point to something like C: moral rightness is relative to one’s culture. That's because he's probably saying that while some actions are permissible, the moral rightness is context-dependent. So, the right answer should be C.

The correct answer is C: "Moral rightness is relative to one’s culture." This aligns with Cicero's emphasis on cultural context in morality, suggesting that what is right varies by culture. 

Answer: C
