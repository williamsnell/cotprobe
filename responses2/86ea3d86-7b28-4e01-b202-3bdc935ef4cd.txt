C: y = 13 - 36
D: 36 - y = 13
E: 13 = y + 36
F: y = 36 - 13
G: y + 36 = 13
H: y - 36 = 13
I: 36 + y = –13
J: 36 = y + 13

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is asking which equation represents "36 less than a number y is equal to 13." Hmm, I need to break this down.

First, the phrase "36 less than a number y" translates to y minus 36. So, y minus 36 equals something. The problem says that this equals 13. So the equation should be y minus 36 equals 13. Let me write that down: y - 36 = 13.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option D is "36 - y = 13." Wait, that's not the same as what I have. Because in my equation, it's y - 36. So the order is different. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says "36 less than y is equal to 13." So it's like y minus 36 = 13. So the equation is y -36 =13. That's option D. Wait, no, option D is "36 - y =13." Oh, I see. So that's not the same. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Wait, maybe I should read the problem again. It says, "36 less than a number y is equal to 13." So that's y minus 36 equals 13. So the equation is y-36=13. Looking at the options, that's option D: 36 - y =13? No, option D is 36 - y = 13, which is the same as option D. So that's not matching.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me check each option. Option D is 36 - y = 13. That would imply y is 36 -13= 23. But according to my equation, y would be 36 +13=49. Because y-36=13 → y=13+36=49. So option D is 36 - y =13 → y=23. That's not the same as my equation.

So wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me go through each option again.

Option A: 13 + y =36 → y=36-13=23. Doesn't match the problem.

Option B:13 - y=36 → y=13-36= -23. Doesn't match.

Option C: y=13 -36 → y=-23. No.

Option D: 36 - y=13 → y=36-13=23. No, same as A.

Option E:13= y +36 → y=13-36=-23. No.

Option F:y=36-13 → y=23. Hmm, same as A.

Option G:y +36=13 → y=13-36=-23. No.

Option H:y -36=13 → y=13+36=49. Oh, this matches what I thought earlier. So the equation is y -36=13, which is option H. So the correct answer should be option H.

Wait, but the question is asking which equation represents 36 less than y is 13. So the equation is y -36 =13. Option H says y -36=13. So that's correct.

So the answer is H.

The correct equation is y - 36 = 13, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
