Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about submerged objects displacing fluids. Let's see, the question is: "A completely submerged object always displaces its own..." and the options are various properties of the fluid. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, when an object is submerged in a fluid, it experiences a buoyant force. I remember something about Archimedes' principle here. Oh right! Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. So, if the object is completely submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. But wait, what's the question again? It says the object displaces its own... something.

Wait, the options... let's look at them again. The options are about properties of the fluid. So, the question is asking what the object displaces. So the displaced quantity would be related to the fluid's properties. The options are about the fluid's pressure, surface area, density, etc.

Wait, but the question says the object displaces its own... which property? Oh, wait, the options are about the fluid's properties. So the object is displacing a certain amount of fluid. The question is whether it's displacing its own properties.

Wait no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The question says the object displaces its own. So the object is displacing its own... what? Hmm, perhaps it's not about the fluid's properties but the object's own properties.

Wait, maybe I should think again. The question is: "A completely submerged object always displaces its own..." So what does the object displace? It should displace a volume of fluid equal to its own volume, right? But the options are about the fluid's properties. So for each option, is the object displacing that property?

Option A: pressure of fluid. Hmm, pressure is force per unit area. But the displacement is volume, so not directly about pressure.

Option B: surface area. That's area, not volume. So no.

Option C: density. Density is mass per unit volume. But displacement involves volume. So unless the object's volume is the same as the displaced fluid's mass, but I don't think that's directly what's being asked.

Wait, the question is about what the object displaces. So when an object is submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. So the displaced fluid's properties would be related to the object's volume. But looking at the options, none of them directly state anything about volume. Wait, the options are about the fluid's properties like density, pressure, etc., not about the object's properties.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting it. Let me think again. The question is asking what the object displaces. So the displaced volume. But the options are about properties of the fluid. So the correct response would be that the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own. But none of the options A to J directly address the displaced volume. Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the original question.

Wait, the question might be a bit different. Maybe it's about the fluid's properties. Let's read the question again: "A completely submerged object always displaces its own" followed by options A to J. Oh wait, maybe it's the other way around. The question is about what the object displaces. But the options are about the fluid's properties. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, another approach: when an object is submerged, the fluid exerts a force on it. That force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. So the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight. So the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So the displacement of the fluid is based on its own weight, not the object's properties.

Wait, but the options are about fluid properties, so perhaps the question is about the fluid's weight. But the options don't include weight; they're about properties like pressure, surface area, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question is about what the object displaces in terms of the fluid's properties. So, for example, does the object displacing its own volume in the fluid. So the displaced volume is equal to the object's volume.

But the options don't directly address volume. Hmm. Wait, the options are about the fluid's properties. So if the object displaces a certain volume, but the fluid's properties are what affects the displacement. Like, for example, if the fluid has a high density, it might displace more volume. But the question is about what the object displaces, not what determines the displacement.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased wrong. Let me read the question again: "A completely submerged object always displaces its own" and then the options. Oh wait, maybe it's about whether the displaced fluid has a certain property. For example, does it displace its own mass, or its own volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fluid's properties, but it's phrased incorrectly. Let me think: the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. So when the object is submerged, the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight. So the displaced weight depends on the object's weight. But the question is about what the object displaces.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. But the options don't include that; they are about properties of the fluid, like density, pressure, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the fluid's properties. So, if the object is completely submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid. The displaced fluid's properties include things like density, which would be the same as the fluid's density. But the question is asking what the object displaces in terms of the fluid's properties.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think of each option. The question is: "A completely submerged object always displaces its own..." So the object displaces a certain amount of the fluid. The options are about the fluid's properties.

Wait, no, the options are, for example, "pressure of fluid," which is the pressure at a certain depth. If the object is submerged, the pressure increases with depth, but the displaced fluid's pressure would depend on the depth, not the object's own properties.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces its own volume of fluid. So, the displaced volume is equal to the object's volume. But the options don't directly state that; instead, they list properties like density, which is mass per unit volume. If the object's volume is V, then the density of the displaced fluid equals the object's density.

Wait, but the question is about the displaced fluid's properties. So, the displaced fluid's density would be the object's density. So, the object's own density is the fluid's density when displaced. So, if the object is completely submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume, and the density of that displaced fluid equals its own density.

Looking at the options, option D is weight of fluid. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, D is weight of fluid. But when an object is submerged, the displaced fluid's weight (which is the buoyant force) equals the object's weight. So the displaced weight is equal to the object's weight. So the weight of the displaced fluid is equal to the object's weight. But the options are about the properties of the fluid.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight. So, the object displaces a volume of fluid whose weight is equal to its own weight. So the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. But none of the options directly state that; they list different properties.

Alternatively, the question is about what the object displaces, which is a volume. But the options don't include volume. So perhaps the question is incorrect in the options, but I have to choose based on what I know.

Wait, another angle: the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. So the displaced volume is V. But the options don't list V. The options are about the fluid's properties. So perhaps the question is about whether the displaced fluid has a certain property based on the object's properties.

Wait, when the object is completely submerged, the fluid exerts an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. So, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the weight of the displaced fluid depends on the volume of the displaced fluid and the fluid's density. So, W_fluid = W_object → (density_fluid) * V displaced * g = (density_object) * V_object * g. Since the object is completely submerged, V displaced = V object. So, density_fluid = density_object.

Wait, but the question is about what the object displaces. So the displaced volume is V. The options don't mention V. So the options are about the fluid's properties.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces a volume of fluid, which is equal to its own volume. But the options don't have that. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's not an option here. Or perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the fluid's properties when the object is submerged. So, for example, the fluid's density equals the object's density because the displaced fluid's density is equal to the object's. So, if the object is made of a certain material, the displaced fluid's density is same as the object's. So in that case, the displaced fluid's density (which is the same as the object's) would determine the buoyancy. But the options are about properties of the fluid.

Wait, the question is phrased as: "A completely submerged object always displaces its own [property]." So, the object displaces a certain property. For example, the displaced volume, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces a volume of fluid, and that volume is equal to the object's volume. But none of the options are "volume of fluid."

Wait, perhaps the question is about the fluid's weight. If the object displaces a volume V, then the fluid displaced has weight equal to the object's weight. So, for example, if the object's weight is W, the displaced fluid's weight is W. So the fluid's weight is W = density_fluid * V * g.

But the options are about the fluid's properties, not the displaced weight. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces a volume of the fluid equal to its own, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's density is the same as the object's, which would make the object's density the same as the fluid's.

But in the given options, D is the weight of the fluid. So that's different. The displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight, which would be option C: density of fluid. No, because density is mass per unit volume, not about weight.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The question is about the object displacing its own... which property. So, if the object is submerged, the displaced volume is equal to its own. The displaced fluid's properties would include density, which is same as the object's.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about which option is correct. The options are A-F, including all of these. So, the correct answer is E: depth of fluid, because the object is submerged at a certain depth, so the pressure increases with depth, but the question is about displacement.

Wait, no. The pressure increases with depth, but the question is about what the object displaces. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces a volume equal to its own, which would be option E: depth of fluid. Wait, no, because it's about displacement. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces its own volume, but that's not directly an option. So, among the options, the only one that makes sense is option D: weight of fluid. Because when an object is submerged, the buoyant force equals its weight. So the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight. But the options don't say that, they talk about properties.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight, which would be option C: density of fluid. No, because density is mass/volume, not weight.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: weight of fluid.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think: when an object is submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid. The displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is W = m_fluid * g = density_fluid * V_fluid * g. But the object's weight is W = m_object * g = density_object * V_object * g.

Since the object is completely submerged, V_fluid displaced = V_object. So, density_fluid * V * g = density_object * V * g. So, the density_fluid = density_object.

So, the displaced fluid's density is same as the object's. But the options don't include that. The options are about the properties of the fluid. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight. But none of the options state that. The options are about fluid properties.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the object's displacement. So, the object displaces a volume of fluid. But the options don't have volume. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight (D: weight of fluid). But that's not accurate because it's the displaced fluid's weight, not the object's weight.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight, which would be option C: density of fluid — no, that's not right. Option C is about the density of the fluid. So, no.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for the correct answer based on what I remember. From Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. So, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the weight of the displaced fluid is W = density_fluid * V * g. The object's weight is W = density_object * V * g. Since V is same, density_fluid = density_object.

But the options don't have an option about density of the fluid. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's density is the same as the object's. But that's not an option either.

Wait, the question is asking what the object displaces, not the fluid's properties. So, the displaced volume is the object's own volume. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the answer is that the object displaces its own volume, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces its own volume, which would be option E: depth of fluid. Wait, no, depth is about pressure, not volume.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D: weight of fluid. Because the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. But the options are not worded correctly. So, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces its own volume, but the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D: weight of fluid, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think again. The question says, "A completely submerged object always displaces its own..." So, the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own. So, the displaced volume is V. But the options don't say that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight, which is option C: density of fluid. No, that's not correct.

Wait, wait, I think I'm making this more complicated than it is. The question is about the displaced fluid's properties. So, when an object is submerged, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the weight of the displaced fluid is equal to the weight of the object. So, the displaced fluid's weight is the same as the object's weight.

But the options don't have the object's weight; they have options about the fluid's properties. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight. But that's not an option. Alternatively, the correct answer is that the displaced fluid has a certain density, which would be same as the object's.

Wait, but the question is about what the object displaces. So, the displaced volume is V. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's density is equal to the object's. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight, which would make the correct option D: weight of fluid.

Wait, no. The option D is "weight of fluid." So, if the displaced fluid has a weight equal to the object's weight, then option D's weight would be correct. But the question is about what the object displaces. The displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is the object's weight, so D is correct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to recall. The correct answer is that the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own. So, the displaced volume is V = volume of object. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight, which would be option D: weight of fluid. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. The options are about the properties of the fluid. So, what is the displaced fluid's property? If the object is submerged, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight, meaning that the displaced fluid's density is same as the object's. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is E: depth of fluid, but that doesn't make sense because depth affects pressure, not displacement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's density is the same as the object's. So, the displaced fluid's density is same as the object's. But the options are about the fluid's properties, so D is weight, etc., but not density.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer elsewhere. Oh wait, I think the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight, which would make the correct option D: weight of fluid. But no, because the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight, so the displaced fluid's weight is the same as the object's. So, the weight of the displaced fluid is equal to the object's weight. But in the options, D is weight of the fluid, which is correct.

Wait, but the object displaces its own... the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is the same as the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is the same as the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is W = W_object. So, the correct answer is D: weight of fluid. Because the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is D: weight of fluid.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again. The correct answer is that the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is D: weight of fluid.

So, the correct answer is D: weight of fluid. Because when the object is submerged, the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight. So, the displaced fluid's weight is equal to the object's weight. So, D: weight of fluid would be correct.

Wait, but the question is about what the object displaces. So, the displacement is a volume. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is E: depth of fluid.

Wait, no. The question is about displacement, not about the object's own properties. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the displaced fluid's weight equals the object's weight, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the object displaces its own volume, which is not an option, so perhaps the correct answer is E: depth of fluid, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is D: weight of fluid. Because when the object is submerged, the buoyant force equals the object's weight, which is the displaced fluid's weight.
</think>

The correct answer is **D: weight of fluid**. When an object is completely submerged, it displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. According to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force acting on the object is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. Therefore, the weight of the displaced fluid is equal to the weight of the object. 

ANSWER: D
