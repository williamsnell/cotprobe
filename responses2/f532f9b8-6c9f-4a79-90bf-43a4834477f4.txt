Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the P/E ratio for Company A. I remember that the P/E stands for Price-to-Earnings ratio, which is a measure of a company's current share price relative to its earnings per share. The formula I think is P/E = Price per share / Earnings per share. 

Let me check the numbers given. The question states that the current trading price is $150 per share, and the earnings per share (EPS) is $10. So, plugging those into the formula, I get P/E = 150 / 10. That calculation should be straightforward. 

Wait, 150 divided by 10 is 15. So the P/E ratio would be 15. Looking at the options, option A is 15.0. So I think the answer is A.

The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the market price per share by earnings per share. Here, the market price is $150 and EPS is $10. So, P/E = 150 / 10 = 15. The correct option is A: 15.0.
