Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Monte Carlo experiments and antithetic variates. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the question again. It asks which of the statements (i) to (iv) are correct. The options are combinations of these statements.

Let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement i: "Antithetic variates work by reducing the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space." Hmm, I remember that antithetic variates are a technique used in Monte Carlo simulations to reduce the variance of the results. They do this by pairing each random draw with its antithetic counterpart, which is typically 1 minus the original value. This pairing helps to balance out the distribution, so you don't need as many samples to cover the entire probability space. So, statement i sounds correct.

Statement ii: "Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically." Wait, I think that's the definition of antithetic variates. They're constructed by using pairs of random variables that are negatively correlated. So yes, this statement is correct. So statement ii is correct.

Statement iii: "Antithetic variates involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws." Wait, no. If we take the negative of each draw, that's actually creating antithetic variates. Because each variable is paired with its negative. So for example, if you have a random draw x, you use -x as the antithetic value. So statement iii says you use the negative of each draw. So that's correct. So statement iii is correct.

Statement iv: "Antithetic variates involve taking one over each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws." Hmm, wait. Taking one over each random draw would invert each variable. So like, if you have x, you use 1/x. But I don't think that's the standard definition of antithetic variates. Antithetic variates are about pairing each variable with its negative. So statement iv is incorrect.

So let's recap:

i: correct.

ii: correct.

iii: correct.

iv: incorrect.

Wait, but wait. I need to make sure about statement iii. Oh, wait, the way statement iii is phrased: "Using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws." So if you have variable x, you take -x as the antithetic value. So statement iii is correct because you are using the negative (antithetic) values. So statement iii is correct.

So all the statements except iv are correct. Let me see the options.

The options are:

A: (i), (iii), and (iv) only → No, iv is incorrect.

B: (ii) and (iii) only → No, i and ii are correct, but iii is correct.

C: (iii) and (iv) only → No, iv is wrong.

D: (i) and (iv) only → No, i and ii are correct.

E: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only → No, iv is wrong.

F: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) → No, iv is wrong.

G: All are correct → No, iv is wrong.

H: (i) and (iii) only → Yes, because i and iii are correct, and iv is wrong.

Wait, but wait. Wait another thought: statement iii says "using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws." So for each x, you use -x as the antithetic variable. So that's correct. So statement iii is correct.

So which statements are correct? i, ii, iii, and iv is incorrect. So the correct statements are i, ii, iii.

Looking at the options, option H is (i) and (iii) only. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but let me think again about statement iii. The wording says "using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws." So for each x, you use -x. So yes, statement iii is correct.

So the correct statements are (i), (ii), (iii). So the correct answer is option H: (i) and (iii) only.
</think>

The correct answer is option **H: (i) and (iii) only**. 

- **Statement i** is correct because antithetic variates reduce the number of replications by leveraging negative correlations, covering the probability space efficiently.
- **Statement ii** is correct as it describes the construction of antithetic variates, using pairs of values with known analytical properties.
- **Statement iii** is correct because it involves using the negative (antithetic) values as draws in the simulation.
- **Statement iv** is incorrect because it suggests taking the reciprocal of each draw, which is not the definition of antithetic variates.

Thus, the statements that are correct are **i, ii, and iii**, making the correct option **H**.

ANSWER: H
