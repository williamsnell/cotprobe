Okay, so I've got this question about the origins of human aggressive behavior, and I need to figure out which two theoretical points of view are correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the question is asking about two main theoretical perspectives. The options given are A to J, each with different theories. I need to recall what each theory suggests.

I know that psychological theories often differ in how they explain behavior. Let me think about the options:

Option B says Evolutionary psychology and learned behavior theory. I remember that evolutionary psychology focuses on the idea that behavior is driven by biological survival, so things like aggression might be the result of an evolutionary advantage. On the other hand, learned behavior theory suggests that behavior is learned through social and environmental influences. So, these two could be two main points of view.

Option A is about biological predisposition and environmental triggers. That sounds more like the biological perspective, which is part of evolutionary psychology, but it's two separate aspects. So they might not be the main two points of view.

Option B's combination of evolutionary psychology and learned behavior theory seems to fit. I think evolutionary psychology is often associated with the idea that behavior is heritable and passes down through generations, while learned behavior theory is about how behavior is acquired through conditioning. These are distinct but both important in understanding origins.

Looking at the other options, E is about hormonal imbalance and cultural aggression. That doesn't ring a bell for origins of aggressive behavior. Similarly, other options like G, H, I, etc., don't seem directly related to the origins of aggressive behavior in a biological or psychological sense.

So, the correct answer should be B. It's the two main theories that discuss the origins of human aggressive behaviorâ€”evolutionary psychology and learned behavior theory.
