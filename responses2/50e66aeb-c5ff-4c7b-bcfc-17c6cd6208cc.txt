Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about wave superposition. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's see. The question says that two traveling waves of equal frequency are superimposing in a medium, with one having an amplitude of 4 cm and the other 6 cm. I need to figure out what the displacement D of the resultant wave looks like from the given options.

Wait, I remember that when waves add together, their displacements interfere. But when do you get constructive or destructive interference? Oh right, constructive interference happens when the waves are in phase, and destructive when they're opposite. But for amplitude, I think the maximum displacement occurs when they add constructively, and the minimum when destructively.

So, the amplitudes are 4 cm and 6 cm. If they constructively interfere, the maximum possible displacement D would be 4+6=10 cm. That's right, because each peak adds up. But wait, what about the minimum? Oh, wait, can they completely cancel each other? Like, when one is in phase and the other is out of phase by 180 degrees? Then the amplitudes would subtract. So the minimum would be 6-4=2 cm, because 6-4 is 2 cm. But wait, can that happen?

Wait a second, no. If the two waves have different amplitudes, can they actually completely cancel each other out? Because when their phases are opposite, the peak of the larger wave will overtake the smaller one. But if the smaller wave is large enough, maybe it doesn't completely cancel. Oh, wait, I think that in this case, the maximum possible is 10 cm and the minimum is 2 cm. So the resultant D can vary between 2 and 10 cm.

Looking at the options, option F is 2 cm ≤ D ≤10 cm. So that would be the answer. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: 6 cm — seems like the average, but doesn't account for variation.
B: 2 cm — maybe the minimum, but doesn't include variation.
C:4 cm — same problem.
D:10 cm — maximum, but doesn't describe the range.
E:10-12 — probably not correct because 10 is the max.
F: 2-10 — covers the range of possible D.
G:6-10 — only includes the maximum when the smaller is 6 and doesn't consider when the larger contributes.
Wait, no, if the bigger wave is 6 and the smaller is 4, when they interfere destructively, the resultant is 2. So the minimum possible is 2 cm. So the displacement can be anywhere between 2 and 10 cm, inclusive. So the correct option is F.

The problem involves two traveling waves of equal frequency with amplitudes 4 cm and 6 cm superimposing in a medium. When waves superimpose, their displacements combine based on their phase relationship. Constructive interference occurs when the waves are in phase, leading to the maximum possible displacement, which is the sum of the amplitudes: \( 4 \, \text{cm} + 6 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{cm} \). On the other hand, destructive interference occurs when one wave is in phase and the other is out of phase by \( 180^\circ \), leading to the minimum possible displacement, which is the difference of the amplitudes: \( 6 \, \text{cm} - 4 \, \text{cm} = 2 \, \text{cm} \). Therefore, the resultant displacement \( D \) can vary between \( 2 \, \text{cm} \) and \( 10 \, \text{cm} \). 

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: \( D = 6 \, \text{cm} \) is incorrect as it does not account for the range of possible displacements.
- **B**: \( D = 2 \, \text{cm} \) is incorrect because it only represents the minimum displacement, not the full range.
- **C**: \( D = 4 \, \text{cm} \) is incorrect for the same reason as above.
- **D**: \( D = 10 \, \text{cm} \) is correct as it represents the maximum displacement but does not describe the range.
- **E**: \( 10 \, \text{cm} \leq D \leq 12 \, \text{cm} \) is incorrect because \( 12 \, \text{cm} \) is an overestimate.
- **F**: \( 2 \, \text{cm} \leq D \leq 10 \, \text{cm} \) is correct as it accurately describes the range of possible displacements.
- **G**: \( 6 \, \text{cm} \leq D \leq 10 \, \text{cm} \) is incorrect because it excludes the possibility of the smaller wave contributing to the minimum displacement.
- **H**: \( D = 12 \, \text{cm} \) is incorrect for the same reason as **E**.
- **I**: \( 4 \, \text{cm} \leq D \leq 6 \, \text{cm} \) is incorrect as it does not consider the range of displacements.
- **J**: \( D = 5 \, \text{cm} \) is incorrect because it does not describe the full range of possible displacements.

The correct answer is **F**: \( 2 \, \text{cm} \leq D \leq 10 \, \text{cm} \).
