Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a satellite orbiting a planet. Hmm, I need to find out how the time required for one revolution depends on the given variables. Let me think about the concepts involved here.

So the satellite has mass m, and it's orbiting a planet of mass M. The orbit is circular with radius R. The question is about the time period T for one revolution. The options are various relationships between T and M, R, m, etc.

I remember that for circular orbits, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force. So the gravitational force between the planet and satellite equals (m*v²)/R, where v is the orbital velocity. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of centripetal acceleration. Oh right, the gravitational force F is G*(M*m)/(R²), and this provides the centripetal acceleration for the satellite. Centripetal acceleration is v²/R, so:

F = (M*m)*G/(R²) = (m*v²)/R.

Wait, the m's can cancel out, right? So G*M/(R²) = v²/R. That simplifies to v² = G*M/(R). So v = sqrt(G*M/R). But velocity is 2πR over the period T because in one revolution, the satellite travels the circumference of the circle. So v = (2π R) / T.

Putting it together: (2π R / T)^2 = G*M/R.

Wait, let's write that again. v squared is (4π² R²)/(T²), right? So 4π² R² / T² = G*M/R.

Multiply both sides by T², divide by R: 4π² R / T² = (G M)/R.

Then, 4π² R² / (G M) = T².

So T squared equals (4 π² R²) / (G M). Taking the square root of both sides, T = 2π * sqrt(R²/(G M)) → T = 2π sqrt(R/(G M)).

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck:

From F = (m v²)/R → G M m / R² = m v²/R → cancel m: G M / R² = v² / R → v² = G M / R → v = sqrt( G M / R )

Then v = 2π R / T → (2π R / T)^2 = G M / R.

So (4 π² R²) / T² = G M / R → multiply both sides by T², divide by R: (4 π² R²) / (G M) )= T² → T² = (4 π² R²) / (G M) → T = (2 π R)/sqrt(G M).

Wait, wait, that can't be right because when you have T² proportional to R²/(M), that would make the time proportional to R^(1/2) over sqrt(M) ?

Wait, let me see. T² = (4 π² R²) / (G M) → T² ∝ R² / M. So T ∝ sqrt(R²/M) → T ∝ R / sqrt(M). So T is proportional to R^(1/2) * M^(-1/2). Alternatively, T can be written as T = 2π (R/(G M))^{1/2}.

Wait, but another way to think about Kepler's third law would be that T² is proportional to R³/(M), but wait, that's for when the mass is much larger, like for planets orbiting a star. In our case, the planet's mass M is the central body and the satellite is moving around it.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. The formula we derived is T² = (4π² R³) / (G M) → T = 2π sqrt(R³/(G M)).

Wait, but earlier I thought I had T squared equals R squared over M. But that can't be correct because in the derivation, it's R squared in the numerator.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me carefully go through the steps again.

Start with the gravitational force providing the centripetal acceleration. So:

F_gravity = F_centripetal → G M m / R² = m v² / R.

Cancel m: G M / R² = v² / R → v² = G M / R → v = sqrt( G M / R )

But v is the orbital velocity, which is 2 π R / T. So,

sqrt( G M / R ) = 2 π R / T.

Square both sides: G M / R = (4 π² R²) / T² → T² = (4 π² R²) / ( G M ) → T² = (4 π² R²) / ( G M )

So T² ∝ R² / M → T ∝ R / sqrt(M) → T is proportional to R^(1/2) multiplied by M^(-1/2).

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: independent of M

B: proportional to R^(1/2)

C: proportional to m^(1/2)

D: linear in M

E: proportional to M^(1/2)

F: proportional to m^(3/2)

G: linear in m

H: proportional to R^(3/2)

I: independent of R

J: linear in R

Hmm. So according to my calculation, T is proportional to R^(1/2) * M^(-1/2). That is, T ∝ sqrt(R) / sqrt(M). So T is proportional to R^(1/2) and inversely proportional to M^(1/2). Looking at the options, option B says proportional to R^(1/2), which would be correct if M were constant. But in this case, M is varying.

Wait, but the question asks for the relationship between T and the variables given. The variables are M, R, m. Oh wait, wait, wait—because in the problem statement, the satellite's mass is m. But in the formula, m cancels out. So the period T depends only on M, R, and G. Because in the formula, T² is proportional to R³/(M), but wait, no, according to the formula I derived, T² is proportional to R²/(M).

Wait, that suggests that T depends on R squared and inversely on M. So if M increases, T decreases. And if R increases, T increases.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the derivation. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's rederive the formula properly. The gravitational force is F = G M m / R².

This force provides the centripetal acceleration for the satellite, so F = m v² / R.

Set equal:

G M m / R² = m v²/R → Cancel m: G M / R² = v² / R → Multiply both sides by R: G M / R = v² → v = sqrt( G M / R )

But v is the orbital speed, which is 2π R / T → So,

sqrt( G M / R ) = 2 π R / T → Square both sides: G M / R = 4 π² R² / T² → Multiply both sides by T²: G M T² / R =4 π² R² → T² = (4 π² R^3) / (G M) → T = (2 π R^(3/2)) / sqrt(G M) )

Wait, wait! Oh, I think I messed up earlier. Let me correct that.

Wait, when I square both sides of sqrt( G M / R ) = 2 π R / T → Squaring gives G M / R = (4 π² R²) / T² → So T² = (4 π² R²) * R / (G M) → T² = (4 π² R^3) / (G M) → So T = 2 π R^(3/2) / sqrt( G M ) → Thus, T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M).

So T ∝ R^(3/2) / sqrt(M).

Wait, so that would mean T is proportional to R^(3/2) and M^(-1/2). So for the options, T is proportional to R^(3/2), which is option H. But wait, that contradicts the earlier derivation.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the formula again.

We have T² = (4 π² R^3) / ( G M )

So T = 2 π R^(3/2) / sqrt( G M )

Thus, T = (2 π / sqrt(G M)) ) * R^(3/2 )

Which implies T is proportional to R^(3/2) over sqrt(M), so T ∝ R^(3/2) * M^(-1/2).

So, the time period depends on R cubed over the square root of M.

So in terms of variables, T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M).

Looking at the options, option H says T is proportional to R^(3/2). But from our analysis, that's only part of the story; it's also proportional to M^(-1/2). So if the question is about the dependence on R and M, then H is correct for R, but the dependence on M is inverse square root.

Wait, but the problem statement is asking about the time required for one revolution in a circular orbit. The options are about each variable's proportionality. So for the time T, it's proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So in terms of the variables, the options are:

- A: independent of M → No, because T depends on M.

- B: proportional to R^(1/2) → No, as it's R^(3/2).

- C: proportional to m^(1/2) → No, because m doesn't appear in T's expression.

- D: linear in M → No, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(M), which is M^(1/2).

- E: proportional to M^(1/2) → No, because it's inverse.

- F: proportional to m^(3/2) → No, m doesn't factor into T.

- G: linear in m → No.

- H: proportional to R^(3/2) → Yes, since T has R^(3/2) term.

- I: independent of R → No.

- J: linear in R → No, it's R^(3/2), which is higher than linear.

Wait, but the question is asking about the time required for one revolution, and the options are about how each variable's value affects the time.

Wait, looking back, the question is a bit ambiguous. The options are about each variable's dependence on T. So the correct answer would be T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So looking at the options, H is the correct one for R, but the question is about the proportionality in general, including M.

Wait, but wait, the options are about the relationships between T and each variable. For example, option H is about R. So the options are:

A: T is independent of M.

B: T is proportional to R^(1/2)

C: T is proportional to m^(1/2)

D: T is linear in M.

E: proportional to M^(1/2).

F: proportional to m^(3/2).

G: linear in m.

H: proportional to R^(3/2).

I: independent of R.

J: linear in R.

So according to our formula, T is proportional to R^(3/2) and M^(-1/2), so it's proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M).

Looking at the options, the option that says T is proportional to R^(3/2) is option H. So H is correct for the R part, but the question is about how T depends on R and M in general, considering all variables.

Wait, but the question is about each variable's relationship. The question doesn't specify which variable to choose. Hmm, but looking at the options given, the correct answer is that T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So the correct option is H, which states T is proportional to R^(3/2).

But wait, that can't be the case because the options are about each variable. Oh wait, no: the question is about how the time T depends on M, R, and m. So the correct answer must account for all three variables.

Wait, but in the derivation, the mass m cancels out entirely. So the period T depends only on M, R, and G. So the time period T is independent of the satellite's mass m. So the correct answer must not depend on m. Looking at the options, option G says "linear in m" which is incorrect since m doesn't appear in T's expression.

Wait, but the question is about the time T's dependence. The given answer options may not all have all variables, but perhaps for each variable, the proportionality.

Wait, for example, in the options, A is about M. So in the formula, T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So for M, T is linear in 1/sqrt(M). So the option saying T is proportional to 1/sqrt(M) would be correct, which is option E. But option E is proportional to M^(1/2), which is the opposite of what we have.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The formula is T = (2 π R^(3/2)) / sqrt(G M) → So T ∝ R^(3/2) / sqrt(M).

So for each variable:

- T is proportional to R^(3/2) → which matches option H.

- T is inversely proportional to sqrt(M) → which is M^(-1/2). So for M, the proportionality is inverse square root.

But looking at the options, the only option that correctly accounts for T being proportional to R^(3/2) is option H.

Wait, but the question is asking which option correctly describes the relationship between the time T and each variable. So perhaps the correct answer is H for R and M for T. But in the options, the variables are considered separately.

Wait, the actual question says: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

The answer options are A to J, each with a statement about T.

So the correct proportionality for T is proportional to R^(3/2), which is option H. Additionally, it's inversely proportional to sqrt(M), but the options don't list that combination. The question is about how T depends on each variable, so perhaps the correct answer is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H and another is not present.

Wait, but the question options don't include an option that combines R and M. The options are about each variable's dependence: for example, option H is about R, which is correct. But the question is about how the time T depends on each variable. So for each variable, the correct proportionality is as follows:

For M: T ∝ 1/√M → So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(M). The option saying T is proportional to M^(-1/2) is not given; the closest is option E, which says T is proportional to M^(1/2), which is incorrect.

Wait, but the given options don't include an option that states T is proportional to M^(-1/2). So perhaps the correct answer is that T is proportional to R^(3/2), so the correct option is H.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula I derived is T = (2 π R^(3/2)) / sqrt(G M).

So T ∝ R^(3/2) / sqrt(M) → It's proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to M^(1/2).

So for each variable:

- T is proportional to R^(3/2) → Option H.

- T is proportional to M^(-1/2) → So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(M).

Looking at the options, the only option that correctly describes T's dependence on R is option H. Similarly, for M, the dependence is inverse square root.

But the question is not multiple variables; it's about each variable's effect. The correct option among the given choices would be option H (T proportional to R^(3/2)) and another option would be incorrect.

Wait, but the options are a list of statements, each about a single variable's effect. So the correct answer is that T is proportional to R^(3/2), which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, and the other options are incorrect. So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Another approach: the formula for the orbital period in circular orbit is T = 2π (R^3/(G M))^(1/2). Wait, no, because earlier derivation leads to T = 2 pi R^3/(G M)^(1/2) → T^2 = 4 pi^2 R^3/( G M ), so T = 2 pi R^(3/2) / sqrt(G M), which confirms that T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M).

So in the options, the only one that correctly states the dependence on R is option H, which says T is proportional to R^(3/2). But wait, the question asks for the time required for one revolution, which depends on R and M.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is H. Because option H is about R, which is correct. But what about M? The correct statement would be that T is proportional to M^(-1/2), but no option reflects that. So the options given don't include a combined option for all three variables. So the options are about each variable's effect on T.

So the options are about each variable:

A) independent of M → No, because T depends on M.

B) proportional to R^(1/2) → No, because T depends on R^(3/2).

C) proportional to m^(1/2) → No, because m doesn't affect T.

D) linear in M → No, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(M).

E) proportional to M^(1/2) → No, same reason.

F) proportional to m^(3/2) → No.

G) linear in m → No.

H) proportional to R^(3/2) → Yes.

I) independent of R → No.

J) linear in R → No.

So the correct answer is H, since it correctly states the dependence on R, and the question is about how the time T depends on M, R, and m. But since in the derivation, m cancels out, the correct relationship is only about R and M.

Wait, but the options don't include an option that says T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So perhaps the correct option is H, which correctly states the dependence on R, but the question is about the dependence on M as well.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me think again. The formula for T is T = 2 pi R^(3/2) / sqrt(G M). So T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So the correct option is H (proportional to R^(3/2)), and another option (if considering M) would be E (proportional to M^(1/2)), which is incorrect.

But the options only have H stating R^(3/2). So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought T is proportional to R^(1/2), but that was only when M is fixed, but in this case, when M varies, the dependence changes.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, which states that T is proportional to R^(3/2). But the problem is, the options are given as separate statements. So 'H' is the correct statement for R, and another is not given.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, and the other variables are not in the options. So the correct option is H.

Wait, but another approach: Let's express T in terms of M. Since M is a variable, and in the formula T ∝ 1/sqrt(M), the option that says T is proportional to M^(-1/2) would be correct. But in the given options, the only option that reflects a relationship involving M is option E: T is proportional to M^(1/2), which is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be H, as the question is about how T depends on R, and how it depends on M.

Wait, but the question is about which statement correctly describes the dependence of T on M, R, and m. Since in the derivation, m doesn't affect T, the correct statements for T would be that it's proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M).

So the correct answer is H, but it's not the only correct statement. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is H, and the correct option is H.

But looking at the options again, the only option that correctly states the dependence on R is H.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H.

In conclusion, the time period T is proportional to R^(3/2) and inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So the correct option among the given choices is H.

To determine the correct relationship between the time period \( T \) and the given variables, we analyze the scenario as follows:

1. **Derivation of \( T \):**  
   The gravitational force provides the centripetal acceleration for the satellite.  
   \[
   \frac{GMm}{R^2} = \frac{mv^2}{R}
   \]  
   Canceling \( m \) and simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{GM}{R^2} = \frac{v^2}{R} \implies \frac{GM}{R} = v^2
   \]  
   The orbital velocity \( v \) is given by:  
   \[
   v = \frac{2\pi R}{T}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v \) into the equation:  
   \[
   \frac{GM}{R} = \left(\frac{2\pi R}{T}\right)^2 \implies \frac{GM}{R} = \frac{4\pi^2 R^2}{T^2}
   \]  
   Solving for \( T^2 \):  
   \[
   T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 R^3}{GM}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   T = \frac{2\pi R^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}
   \]  

2. **Analysis of \( T \):**  
   From the derived formula:  
   \[
   T \propto R^{3/2} \cdot M^{-1/2}
   \]  
   This means:  
   - \( T \) is proportional to \( R^{3/2} \) (Option H).  
   - \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( \sqrt{M} \) (not directly addressed by the given options).  
   Since the satellite's mass \( m \) cancels out, it does not affect \( T \).  

3. **Evaluation of Options:**  
   - **A:** Incorrect. \( T \) depends on \( M \), not independent.  
   - **B:** Incorrect. \( T \) is not proportional to \( R^{1/2} \).  
   - **C:** Incorrect. \( T \) is not proportional to \( m^{1/2} \).  
   - **D:** Incorrect. \( T \) is not linear in \( M \).  
   - **E:** Incorrect. \( T \) is not proportional to \( M^{1/2} \).  
   - **F:** Incorrect. \( T \) is not proportional to \( m^{3/2} \).  
   - **G:** Incorrect. \( T \) is not linear in \( m \).  
   - **H:** Correct. \( T \) is proportional to \( R^{3/2} \).  
   - **J:** Incorrect. \( T \) is not linear in \( R \).  

Thus, the correct answer is **H**, as \( T \) is proportional to \( R^{3/2} \).  

ANSWER: H
