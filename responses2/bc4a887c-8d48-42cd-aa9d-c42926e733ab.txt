Question:

Police officers received an anonymous tip that two men were selling cocaine from the back of a restaurant. The tipster stated to the police that the two men were both tall white men who were wearing jeans and black shirts, the uniform of the restaurant. The tipster also said that one of the men had red hair and was wearing a tan ball cap and the other man had black hair and was wearing a red ball cap. The police set up surveillance on the back of the restaurant and saw the two men make several hand- to-hand transactions. Upon receiving authority to make the arrest from their commanding officer, they waited for the two men to come out again. About two hours later, the two men came out again, this time with a woman. The officers arrested the two men and detained the woman to determine her involvement. The officers took the woman's purse without her consent and searched it for illegal narcotics. In her purse they found three grams of crack cocaine, digital scales, a small glass pipe used for inhaling crack cocaine, and a balloon of black tar heroin. The woman was then arrested on the various drug charges. The woman was thereafter prosecuted and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. She filed a motion to exclude the drugs and the paraphernalia from evidence. Her motion will most likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that she was involved in the drug transactions.
B: denied, because the search was justified, since she was about to leave the scene of the crime.
C: granted, because the woman was not given a chance to refuse the search of her purse.
D: granted, because the police violated her right to privacy by searching her purse without her consent.
E: denied, because the woman was in a public place where she had a reduced expectation of privacy.
F: denied, because the police were acting in the interest of public safety.
G: denied, because she was sufficiently close or proximate to the crime scene to justifi the warrantless search.
H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before conducting the search.
I: granted, because the police should have asked for her consent before searching her purse.
J: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of her purse.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this police search and search statute question. Let me break it down.

So, the scenario is that police received a tip that two men were selling crack cocaine. They looked at the tips and thought they were tall white men with black shirts. One had red hair and a tan ball cap, the other black hair and red ball cap. They saw them in a restaurant and then waited for them again.

Then, when they arrested them, the woman came out later with her purse. The police searched her purse without her consent and found some illegal substances. The woman was then charged. Her motion was to exclude the drugs and paraphernalia from evidence.

The question is about what the woman's motion should be. The options are from A to J, each making a different argument.

I remember from my law class that when searching someone's property without consent, it's generally not allowed unless there's a specific reason. The main idea is that a warrant is necessary to search for evidence. But sometimes, in the interest of public safety, a warrant isn't needed if the suspect is in a public place with limited privacy.

Looking at the options, option E says the woman was in a public place with reduced privacy, which might make a warrant unnecessary. Option C says the search wasn't necessary because she was close enough. Option J also talks about probable cause, but without that, I'm not sure.

Wait, the police were acting in public safety. If the woman was in a public place, maybe the police didn't need a warrant because they were checking for someone in that area. So, the search was justified because it was for someone in a public place. That would make E a good reason to deny the warrant. But wait, E says the woman was in a public place with reduced privacy, which might not be enough. Or does it? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Another point is whether the woman was close enough to the crime scene. The question says she came out again, so perhaps she was nearby. But the reasoning in E is that she's in a public place, which gives her limited privacy. So the police were acting in the interest of public safety, hence the search was justified.

So, looking at the options, E says the woman was in a public place with reduced privacy, which would make the warrant unnecessary. But then J says the search wasn't probable cause. Wait, without probable cause, the search is unreasonable. But I think the main issue here is the public setting, so E is more about the public setting than probable cause.

Wait, wait. The woman was in the restaurant, which is a public place. So their search was for her, but in a public area. So perhaps it's justified because she's in a place where her privacy is limited.

So, the motion to exclude the drugs and paraphernalia would be denied because the police had reasonable suspicion. But wait, the correct reasoning is that the police were acting in the interest of public safety, so the search was justified.

Looking again at the options, E says the woman was in a public place with reduced privacy. So the reasoning would be that the police acted in the interest of public safety, so the search was justified, not based on a warrant.

So the correct answer would be E: denied, because the police were acting in the interest of public safety.

The police were acting in the interest of public safety because the woman was in a public place with reduced privacy. This makes option E the correct answer.

Answer: E
