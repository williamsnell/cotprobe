Okay, so I've got this question about designing a steel bar to withstand an axial load using Euler's formula. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to figure it out step by step.

The question says the load is 5500 lbs, factor of safety is 2.5. The length is 222 inches. I need to find the correct bar size from the options given.

Wait, Euler's formula is used for determining the critical load for buckling, right? Oh wait, actually, Euler's formula is for the Euler buckling load, which is when the column is slender enough to prevent buckling. So the formula is P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k² * (1 - (m²/L²))), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh, right, for a column with ends in the middle, it's P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k² * (1 - (m²/L²))). But wait, maybe for a more simplified case, we can ignore m and k because the problem doesn't specify the end conditions.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the Euler formula is simplified for the case of long columns (where lateral ends are free, etc.) and m is 0, so the term (1 - m²/L²) becomes 1. So the formula becomes P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k²). 

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k² * (1 - (m²/L²))). But if m is zero, the denominator becomes 1. So, in that case, the critical load is P_e = (π² * E * L²) / k².

Wait, but I think for the Euler load, which is the maximum load before it starts to buckle, the formula is P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k² * (1 - m²/(L²))), but if m is zero, it's (π² E L²)/(k²).

Assuming m is zero, which would be for a column with ends that are simply supported and not fixed, so it's a long column. But perhaps the question is referring to Euler buckling, which is a critical load before it starts to fail. So, the Euler load (P_euler) is the maximum load that can be applied without causing buckling.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look up the Euler buckling formula. Oh wait, I can't, so I'll think it through. Euler's critical load for a column is given by P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k² * (1 - (m²/L²))). But for a column with ends in the middle, the effective length L might be half the actual length, depending on the end condition. Oh wait, if the ends are fixed, the effective length is L/2, and if they're simply supported, it's L.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the end conditions. Hmm, so maybe I should make an assumption. The problem says 'Euler load' which is the critical load. So perhaps the question is asking for the Euler buckling load, not the critical load. Because Euler's formula is indeed used for calculating the critical load, not the critical stress.

Wait, the question says: "design a steel bar to withstand an axial load of 5500 lbs based on the Euler load." Oh, so the Euler load is the maximum load before it's about to fail due to buckling. So the critical load is the maximum load before it fails. So we're given P = 5500 lbs, and we need to find the bar size such that the critical load is at least that, considering the factor of safety.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the Euler formula to calculate the required cross-sectional area to withstand the load. Because the Euler formula gives the critical load, so if the bar is to withstand a load of 5500, then the critical load must be greater than 5500, considering the factor of safety.

Wait, the factor of safety is 2.5. So we need to find the bar's cross-sectional area such that the critical load is (P) * safety factor. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for Euler's critical load (P_e) is (π² * E * L²) / (k²). But I'm a bit confused about the effective length L. Let me see: for a column, L is the actual length, and k is the effective length factor, which depends on the end conditions.

But since the problem doesn't specify end conditions, perhaps we can assume it's a simple column, so k = 1. Alternatively, if it's a fixed end, k would be 0.5 or something else. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the question says 'design a steel bar to withstand an axial load of 5500 lbs based on the Euler load' — which suggests that we're calculating the critical load that the bar must not exceed. So the critical load (P_e) must be greater than or equal to 5500 lbs multiplied by the factor of safety.

Wait, but the factor of safety is 2.5. So, the actual load the bar should be able to handle is 5500 / 2.5 = 2200 lbs. Wait, no: wait, the factor of safety is usually applied to the stress. So, perhaps the load is applied such that the stress is within the allowable limit. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let me clarify:

1. The problem is about a steel bar, so we're likely talking about the cross-sectional area that can carry a certain load without exceeding Euler's critical load.

2. The given load is 5500 lbs. But the design should ensure that the critical load is higher than 5500, considering safety. So the critical load must be >= 5500 * 2.5? Or maybe the other way. Wait, no — the factor of safety is the ratio of the strength to the applied load. So if the bar's strength is S and the applied load is P, then S = P * safety. So S = P * 2.5.

So, the critical load (P_e) must be >= 5500 lbs, but since we are considering the strength, P_e must be less than or equal to 5500 lbs * 2.5.

Wait, but the question says 'based on the Euler load', so perhaps the bar's critical load must be at least 5500 * 2.5? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the bar is designed to handle a load up to 5500 lbs without failing, considering the Euler load. So the critical load (the maximum before it fails) must be greater than 5500 lbs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate:

We have to design a bar that can withstand 5500 lbs under Euler's load conditions. So, the critical load must be at least 5500 lbs, but perhaps the bar's strength is higher, so we need to make sure that the critical load is higher than 5500, considering safety.

Wait, no. Wait, the factor of safety is 2.5. So the actual allowable load is 5500 / 2.5. Let me compute that: 5500 / 2.5 is 2200 lbs. So the bar must be designed to withstand a load of 2200 lbs, but wait, no, the Euler load is the critical load that would cause failure, so perhaps the bar's critical load must be higher than 2200. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach it step by step.

Given:

- Axial load to be withstand: 5500 lbs
- Factor of safety: 2.5
- Column length: L = 222 inches
- End conditions: not specified, so assume it's a simple column (so k =1)

Wait, but without knowing k, perhaps I can make an assumption. For a simple column, k=1.

So the critical load (P_e) is calculated using Euler's formula:

P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k²) 

Wait, but wait — the formula is P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k² (1 - m²/L²)), but for m=0 (which I think is the case when the ends are simply supported), then it becomes (π² E L²)/(k² * 1) = (π² E L²)/k².

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the formula is for the Euler buckling load, which is P_e = (π² E L²)/(k² (1 - m²/L²)). But without knowing m, perhaps it's best to proceed with the assumption that m=0. So P_e = (π² E L²)/k².

But E is the modulus of elasticity of steel. I think steel has a modulus around 29,000,000 psi (pounds per square inch). Wait, 29 × 10^6 psi.

So, let's compute P_e, the critical load.

P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k²)

We have:

E = 29,000,000 psi,

L = 222 inches,

k = 1 (simple column).

Compute each part:

π² is approximately 9.8696.

So,

P_e = (9.8696 * 29e6 * (222)^2) / (1^2)

Compute each step:

First, (222)^2 = 222 * 222. Let's compute that.

222 * 200 = 44,400

222 * 22 = 4,884 → 44,400 + 4,884 = 49,284. So 222^2 = 49,284 square inches.

Now, multiply E: 29e6 * 49,284 = ?

Let's compute 29e6 * 49,284:

= 29,000,000 * 49,284

Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute 29e6 * 49,284:

= 29 * 49,284 * 1e6 

= (29 * 49,284) * 1e6.

29 * 49,284: Let's compute 30 *49,284= 1,478,520. Subtract one times 49,284 (since 29 = 30 -1), so 1,478,520 -49,284 = 1,429,236.

So 29e6 * 49,284 = 1,429,236e6 = 1,429,236,000,000.

Multiply by pi squared (approx 9.8696):

P_e = (9.8696 * 1,429,236,000,000) / 1

Wait, that's 9.8696 * 1.429236e12.

Wait, 1.429236e12 * 10 = 1.429236e13 → 9.8696 * 1.429236e12 = ?

Let me calculate 9.8696 * 1.429236e12.

Wait, alternatively, 9.8696 * 1,429,236,000,000 = ?

Well, 1,429,236,000,000 is 1.429236e12.

So 9.8696 * 1.429236e12 = ?

Compute 1.429236e12 * 10 = 1.429236e13 → but we have 9.8696, which is less than 10.

So 1.429236e12 * 9.8696 = ?

Let me compute 1.429236e12 * 9.8696:

= 1.429236 * 9.8696 * 1e12.

What's 1.429236 * 9.8696?

Approx 1.429 * 9.87 → let's compute that.

1.429 * 10 = 14.29, subtract 1.429 * 0.13.

0.13 *1.429 = approx 0.18577.

So 14.29 - 0.18577 = 14.1042.

So approx 14.1042e12 psi·inches²? Wait, but wait, the units.

Wait, E is in psi (pounds per square inch), L is in inches, so E*L² is (psi * in²) * in² = psi * in^4.

So P_e would be in pounds (since the units would be psi * in^4 = (lbf/in²) * in² = lbf*in).

So, 14.1042e12 psi·in^4 → 14.1042e12 pounds.

Wait, wait, no: wait, 1 psi = 1 lbf/in². So E is lbf/in², L is in, so E L² is (lbf/in²)*(in^2) )= lbf * in².

So, E * L² = 29e6 psi * (222 in)^2 = 29e6 * 49,284 in².

Wait, so E*L² is 29e6 * 49,284 = 1,429,236e6 in² * psi.

Wait, wait, no: E is lbf/in², L is in, so E*L² is lbf/in² * in² = lbf * in.

So, P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (k²) → (pi² * 29e6 * 49,284) / 1.

Wait, that's pi² * 29e6 * 49,284.

So, compute 29e6 * 49,284 = 29 * 49,284 * 1e6.

29 * 49,284 = ?

Well, 30 *49,284 =1,478,520. Subtract 1*49,284 (since 29 =30-1), so 1,478,520 -49,284 = 1,429,236.

So, 29e6 *49,284 =1,429,236 * 1e6 =1,429,236,000,000.

Multiply by pi² (about 9.8696):

1,429,236,000,000 *9.8696 = ?

Let me approximate this.

1,429,236,000,000 * 10 = 14,292,360,000,000.

But since it's 9.8696, which is 10 - 0.1304.

So 14,292,360,000,000 - (0.1304 * 14,292,360,000,000).

Calculate 0.1304 * 14.29236e12 = ?

0.1 *14.29236e12 = 1.429236e12.

0.03 *14.29236e12 = 0.4287708e12 → 4.287708e11.

0.0004 *14.29236e12=5.716944e9.

Adding them together:

1.429236e12 + 0.4287708e12 = 1.8580068e12.

Plus 5.716944e9 → 1.8580068e12 + 0.005716944e12 = 1.863723744e12.

So the total is 14,292,360,000,000 - 1.863723744e12 = 14,290,496,000,000.

Wait, but wait, that's 14.290496e12, which is 1.4290496e13.

But wait, no, because the term was 14,292,360,000,000 -1.863723744e12 = ?

Wait, 14,292,360,000,000 is 1.429236e13.

Subtract 1.863723744e12 → which is 0.1863723744e13.

So, 1.429236e13 - 0.1863723744e13 = 1.2428636256e13.

Wait, that's about 1.24286e13, or 1,242,860,000,000.

So, P_e = approximately 1.24286e13 pounds.

Wait, but wait, that's P_e, the critical load, right? So if the actual load is 5500 lbs, and the critical load is higher than that, then the bar will be under the load, but if it's under the critical load, it will fail.

Wait, but the question is asking to design the bar to withstand 5500 lbs based on Euler's load. So, perhaps the critical load must be higher than 5500, considering safety.

Wait, but in this case, the critical load is 1.24286e13 pounds, which is way higher than 5500. So, perhaps the bar doesn't need to be any larger than 5500. But that seems unlikely because the question says to design the bar to withstand 5500, but under Euler's load.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's think again.

The critical load is the maximum load that a column can handle before it fails. So if the applied load is less than the critical load, it's safe. So, for the bar to withstand 5500, it must be that 5500 < P_e. But wait, in this case, P_e is 1.24e13, which is way higher than 5500. So the bar is safe, regardless of the size, because the critical load is way higher.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question is about designing the bar to withstand 5500 based on Euler's load. So the bar's size must be such that the critical load is at least 5500 * safety factor.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the required critical load: P_e = 5500 * 2.5 = 13750 lbs.

If that's the case, then we need to compute the required length or something else. But in this case, the length is given as 222 inches. So perhaps the question is not about the critical load, but about the cross-sectional area based on the Euler load.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the bar's critical load must be at least 5500 * 2.5. So if the critical load is 5500 * 2.5, then compute the cross-sectional area.

Wait, the formula for Euler's critical load is P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (k^2 * (1 - m²/L²)).

But if we are assuming m=0 (so ends are simply supported), then P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (k^2).

So, if the required critical load is 13750 lbs, then:

13750 = (pi² * E * L²)/ (k^2)

We can solve for L²:

L² = (13750 * k^2 ) / (pi² * E )

Wait, but wait, in our case, L is given as 222 inches. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the bar's cross-sectional area so that the critical load (P_e) is sufficient to support the given load based on the factor of safety.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (k² (1 - m²/L²)).

But perhaps for the given problem, we can proceed under the assumption that m=0, and k=1.

So, the equation becomes P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (k²).

We need to solve for A, where A is the cross-sectional area. But the cross-sectional area is related to the material and dimensions, but in this case, perhaps the problem is that the bar's critical load must be sufficient to support the load.

Wait, perhaps the bar's critical load must be at least 5500 * 2.5. So P_e >=5500 *2.5.

So,

P_e >=13750.

So,

(pi² * E * L²) / (k²) >= 13750.

We can compute L² >= (13750 * k²) / (pi² * E )

But wait, in this case, L is given as 222 inches. So perhaps we're to calculate whether the given L would satisfy P_e >=13750.

But that's not the case. The question is to design the bar to withstand 5500 based on Euler's load. So perhaps the bar's critical load must be at least 5500 * 2.5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the bar's required length.

Wait, but the problem says to design based on Euler's load, so perhaps the bar's length is given, and we have to find the necessary cross-sectional area. But no, the given L is 222 inches, which is perhaps fixed. So this line of reasoning may not be helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the bar's cross-sectional area such that the critical load is sufficient to support the given load.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P_e = (pi² * E * A) / L.

Wait, because P = F/A, so F = (P * A).

But in Euler's formula, P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (k² (1 - m²/L²)).

So, if m=0, P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (k²).

So, perhaps the formula is P_e = (pi² * E * A) / L.

Wait, but that's the formula for stress. So, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is P_e = (pi² * E * A) / (L).

Wait, that can't be right because units don't match. So perhaps I should think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Euler's critical load is:

P_e = (pi² * E * A) / L.

But that's incorrect because the units would not match. So perhaps the correct formula is P_e = (pi² * E * (A)) ) / (L), which is in terms of stress σ = P/A, so P = σ A. So, substituting into P_e:

P_e = (pi² E A) / L = (pi² E σ) A / L.

Wait, I'm getting too deep. Let's think of it differently.

We have to calculate the cross-sectional area A such that the critical load P_e is at least 5500 * 2.5.

Wait, 5500 * 2.5 =13750.

So, P_e >=13750.

We have the formula for P_e as (pi² E L²) / (k² (1 - m²/L²)).

Assuming m=0 and k=1.

So P_e = (pi² E L²) / (1^2) ) = pi² E L².

We need pi² E L² >=13750.

We can solve for A, but in this case, A is related to the bar's dimensions, but in the formula, A is a factor in the formula of P_e. So perhaps I should find the cross-sectional area A required to achieve P_e >=13750.

Wait, but the formula for P_e is:

P_e = (pi² E A) / L.

Wait, no. Because P_e = (pi² E A) / L.

Wait, but that can't be right because units would not match. So perhaps the correct formula is P_e = (pi² E A) / L.

But then, the units would be (lbf * in) / in = lbf. So that would make sense.

Wait, let me double-check.

If P_e = (pi² E A) / L.

Then, the units are ( (lbf in) / in² ) * in ) / in.

Wait, (lbf in)/in² is (lbf * in) / in² = lbf / in.

Multiply by A (in²) → lbf / in * in² → lbf * in.

Divide by L (in) → lbf * in / in → lbf.

So that's correct.

So, P_e has units of lbf.

So, the formula is correct.

So, given that, we can solve for A.

Given:

P_e >=13750.

P_e = (pi² E A) / L.

Rearranging for A:

A = (P_e * L) / (pi² E).

We have P_e =13750, L=222, E=29e6.

Compute:

A = (13750 * 222) / ( (pi²) * 29e6 )

First, compute numerator: 13750 * 222.

Let me compute 13750 * 200 =2,750,000.

13750 * 22 = 298, 750.

Wait, 13750 * 20 =275,000.

13750 * 2 = 27,500.

So 275,000 + 27,500 =302,500.

So total is 2,750,000 + 302,500 =3,052,500.

Wait, but wait: 13750 * 222 is 13750 * (200 +22) = 13750 * 200 + 13750 *22.

13750 *200 =2,750,000.

13750 *22: 13750 *20=275,000; 13750 *2=27,500. So 275,000 +27,500 =302,500.

So total is 2,750,000 +302,500 =3,052,500.

So numerator is 3,052,500.

Denominator is pi² *29e6.

pi² =9.8696.

29e6 =29,000,000.

So denominator is 9.8696 *29,000,000 = let's compute 9.8696 *29e6.

9.8696 *29e6 = (9.8696 * 29) *1e6.

Compute 9.8696 *29:

9 *29=261, 0.8696*29=25.1624.

So 261 +25.1624 =286.1624.

Multiply by 1e6: 286,162,400,000.

So denominator is 286,162,400,000.

So A = 3,052,500 / 286,162,400,000.

Compute this division.

3,052,500 ÷ 286,162,400,000.

Let me write in scientific notation:

3.0525e6 / 2.861624e11 = (3.0525 / 2.861624) * 1e-5.

3.0525 /2.861624 ≈ 1.067.

So, 1.067 *1e-5 =1.067e-5.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would be 0.00001067, which is a very small area.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3,052,500 divided by 286,162,400,000.

3,052,500 / 286,162,400,000 = 3.0525e6 / 2.861624e11.

Compute 3.0525e6 / 2.861624e11 = (3.0525 / 2.861624) * (1e6 /1e11) )= (1.067) * (1e-5) )= 1.067e-5.

Which is 0.00001067.

Wait, that's a very small area. But the bar is 222 inches long, which is a substantial length. So perhaps this calculation is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula for Euler's critical load is:

P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (k² (1 - m²/L²)).

Assuming m=0 and k=1.

So P_e = (pi² * E * L²) / (1 - 0) ) = pi² E L².

So, P_e = pi² E L².

So, solving for L:

L = sqrt( P_e/(pi² E) ).

But wait, in our case, P_e =13750.

So,

L = sqrt(13750/(pi² *29e6)).

Compute inside the sqrt:

13750/(pi² *29e6) )=13750/(9.8696 *29e6).

Compute denominator:9.8696 *29e6 =286,162,400.

So,

13750 /286,162,400 = approx 0.0000479.

So,

L = sqrt(0.0000479) = approx 0.00692 inches.

Wait, that's even smaller than what I calculated before. So perhaps this approach is correct.

So, the bar's length is approximately 0.00692 inches.

Wait, but that seems extremely small for a bar. I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, 13750/(9.8696 *29e6) → Let's compute denominator:

9.8696 *29e6 = 9.8696 *29,000,000.

9.8696 *29,000,000 = Let's compute 9.8696 *29 = 286.1624.

So 286.1624 *1e6 =286,162,400.

So denominator is 286,162,400.

So,

13750 /286,162,400 = Let's compute 13750 ÷286,162,400.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10:1375 /28,616,240 → approx 0.000479.

So,

sqrt(0.000479) = approx 0.0219 inches.

Wait, that's 0.0219 inches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 13750 divided by 286162400.

13750 ÷ 286162400 ≈ 0.000479.

Then, sqrt(0.000479) ≈ 0.0219 inches.

Wait, so L = 0.0219 inches.

Wait, that's a very short bar. So perhaps the bar is 0.0219 inches in length, but that seems unrealistic.

Wait, but perhaps this is correct. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula for Euler's critical load is:

P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (k² (1 - m²/L²)).

Assuming m=0 and k=1, then:

P_e = (π² * E * L²) / (1 - 0) ) → P_e = π² * E * L².

So, solving for L:

L = sqrt( P_e / (π² * E) ).

So,

P_e is 13750.

So,

L = sqrt( 13750 / (π² * 29e6) )

Compute denominator: π² *29e6 → 9.8696 *29e6 → 286,162,400.

So,

13750 /286,162,400 → 0.000479.

Sqrt(0.000479) → ~0.0219 inches.

Wait, that's correct. So the bar's length would be approximately 0.0219 inches.

But that seems too short for a bar. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Euler's critical load is P_e = (π² * E * A ) / L.

In that case, if that's the case, then:

P_e = (π² * E * A ) / L.

Then, solving for A:

A = (P_e * L ) / (π² * E )

Which is the same as before.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to use that formula.

So, let me proceed with that.

We have P_e =13750.

A = (13750 * L ) / (π² * E )

But wait, that's substituting the formula. So in this case, we can't find A without another equation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the bar's cross-sectional area is determined by the strength of the material, so perhaps the problem is to find the cross-sectional area given the Euler's load.

But without knowing the material properties, perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the cross-sectional area such that the critical load is sufficient to support the given load. So, perhaps the bar's cross-sectional area would be (P_e * L ) / (π² * E ).

But without knowing P_e, we can't compute A. So perhaps the problem is to find the cross-sectional area in terms of the given variables.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the formula for P_e is P_e = (π² E L²) / (k² (1 - m²/L²)).

Assuming m=0 and k=1, as before.

So, P_e = π² E L².

We need to find A such that the critical load is sufficient to support the applied load.

Wait, but perhaps the applied load is F = (P_e) / A.

Wait, but no. The applied load is given as 5500. So perhaps the applied load is F =5500.

The critical load is P_e =5500 * safety factor.

So, P_e =5500 * 2.5 =13750.

So, P_e =13750.

Now, using P_e = π² E L²,

We can solve for L.

L = sqrt( P_e / (π² E ) )

Which we have done.

So, L = 0.0219 inches.

Which is approximately 0.0219 inches.

Wait, but that's a very short bar.

Wait, but perhaps that's correct. So perhaps the answer is that the bar's length is approximately 0.0219 inches.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

Compute denominator: π² *29e6.

π² =9.8696.

9.8696 *29e6 =9.8696 *29,000,000.

Compute 9.8696 *29,000,000.

Compute 9.8696 *29 =286.1624.

Multiply by 1e6: 286,162,400.

So denominator is 286,162,400.

Then, 13750 /286,162,400 → 13750 ÷286,162,400 ≈ 0.000479.

So sqrt(0.000479) = 0.0219 inches.

Wait, that's correct. So the bar's length is approximately 0.0219 inches, which is about 0.0219 inches.

Wait, but perhaps in inches, it's 0.0219 inches.

But perhaps this is correct.

So, the bar's length is approximately 0.0219 inches.

So, the cross-sectional area is A = (P_e * L) / (π² E )

But we can't compute A without knowing the bar's material properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the bar's cross-sectional area is given by the Euler's formula, so A = (P_e * L ) / (π² E )

But since A is required, perhaps the calculation is correct.

So, the bar's length is 0.0219 inches.

Which is approximately 0.0219 inches.

So, the answer is approximately 0.0219 inches.

Wait, but perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for critical load is P_e = (π² E A ) / L.

So, if that's the case, then to solve for A, A = (P_e * L ) / (π² E )

But without knowing L, we can't find A.

Wait, but in our problem, we're given P_e, and we're trying to find L.

So, perhaps the problem is to find L given P_e, the given length, etc.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the bar's length is about 0.0219 inches.

So, the answer is approximately 0.0219 inches.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is to compute the cross-sectional area, but without knowing the bar's length, it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-sectional area is determined by the strength of the material, and thus, perhaps the problem is to find the cross-sectional area based on the given Euler's load.

Wait, but without knowing the modulus of elasticity, that's impossible.

So, perhaps the problem is to find the cross-sectional area based on the given Euler's load and the bar's length.

But since both are given, perhaps the calculation is correct.

So, the bar's length is approximately 0.0219 inches.

So, the answer is approximately 0.0219 inches.
</think>

The bar's length is calculated using the critical load formula, yielding a length of approximately 0.0219 inches.
