Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the value of x. Let's read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that positive integers x and y have a product of 56, and x is less than y. Then there's another equation: seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14 times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4. I need to find x, and the options are given from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. First, x and y are positive integers with x < y, and their product is 56. So x * y = 56. Since they're positive integers, I should list all pairs of integers that multiply to 56 and satisfy x < y.

Let me list the factor pairs of 56:

1 and 56 → 1 < 56
2 and 28 → 2 < 28
4 and 14 → 4 < 14
7 and 8 → 7 < 8

So possible pairs for (x, y) are (1,56), (2,28), (4,14), (7,8).

Next, the other condition is 7*(1/x) + 14*(1/y) = 4. Let's write that down as an equation.

So, 7*(1/x) + 14*(1/y) = 4.

We can write this equation as:

(7/x) + (14/y) = 4.

Since x and y are integers from the pairs above, let's test each pair to see which one satisfies this equation.

Starting with the first pair: x=1, y=56.

Plug into the equation:

7/1 + 14/56 = 7 + 0.25 = 7.25. That's not equal to 4. So this pair doesn't work.

Next pair: x=2, y=28.

Calculate 7/2 + 14/28.

7 divided by 2 is 3.5, and 14 divided by 28 is 0.5. So 3.5 + 0.5 = 4. Hey, that's exactly 4! So this pair satisfies the equation.

Wait, but let me check the other pairs just to be sure. Maybe there's another solution.

Next pair: x=4, y=14.

Compute 7/4 + 14/14.

7/4 is 1.75, and 14/14 is 1. So 1.75 + 1 = 2.75, which is not 4. So this pair doesn't work.

Next pair: x=7, y=8.

7/7 = 1; 14/8 = 1.75. So 1 + 1.75 = 2.75, which is again not 4. So this pair doesn't fit either.

So the only pair that works is x=2 and y=28. Therefore, the value of x is 2. Looking at the options, B is 2.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For x=2, y=28:

7*(1/2) = 3.5

14*(1/28) = 0.5

3.5 + 0.5 = 4. Correct.

Yes, that's right. So the answer should be 2, which is option B.
</think>

The problem involves finding positive integers x and y with x < y, such that their product is 56 and satisfy the equation 7/x + 14/y = 4. Testing the factor pairs of 56, only the pair (2, 28) satisfies the equation. Thus, x is 2.

Answer: B: 2
