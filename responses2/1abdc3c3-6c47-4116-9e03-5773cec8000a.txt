Okay, so I have this problem here about B Corporation and their profit function. The question is about calculating the marginal profit and determining the output quantities. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The total profit function is given as π = -$3,000 - $2,400Q + $350Q² - $8.333Q³. I remember that marginal profit is the derivative of the total profit function with respect to quantity Q. So, I need to find the first derivative of π with respect to Q.

Let me write down the function again to get it clear:

π = -3000 - 2400Q + 350Q² - 8.333Q³

To find the marginal profit (which is dπ/dQ), I'll differentiate each term with respect to Q.

The derivative of a constant (-3000) is zero. The derivative of -2400Q is -2400. The derivative of 350Q² is 700Q, and the derivative of -8.333Q³ is -25Q² because 3*8.333 is 25, right? Because 8.333 is 25/3, so 3*(25/3) is 25.

So putting it all together, the marginal profit (MP) is:

MP = dπ/dQ = -2400 + 700Q - 25Q².

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Let me double-check:

- The derivative of -2400Q is -2400, correct.
- 350Q² becomes 700Q, yes.
- 8.333 is 25/3, so 3*(25/3) is 25, so derivative is -25Q². Wait, but the function is -8.333Q³, so 3*(-8.333) is -25. So yes.

So, MP = -2400 + 700Q - 25Q².

Wait, but sometimes marginal profit is just the derivative, which is correct. So part a) is done, I think. So for part b), I need to determine the output quantities. Wait, but wait—the options provided are about different quantities, so perhaps the question is asking for the profit-maximizing output? Or is it about something else?

Wait, the options don't have any 'a)' or 'b)' options. Let me read the question again. The question is:

a) Compute the marginal profit
b) Determine its output quantities

So, the output quantities are the quantities that maximize profit, which would be where marginal profit equals zero.

Wait, but the profit function is a cubic function, so the first derivative is a quadratic, which can have zero, one, or two roots. Those roots would be the quantities where marginal profit is zero.

Wait, but the options are about the quantities, so perhaps the problem is asking for the quantities that maximize profit, which would be where dπ/dQ = 0.

So, let me set the marginal profit equal to zero and solve for Q.

So,

-2400 + 700Q - 25Q² = 0

Let me rearrange the equation:

25Q² - 700Q + 2400 = 0

Wait, perhaps I should multiply both sides by -1 to make the equation easier.

Wait, better to write it as:

25Q² - 700Q + 2400 = 0

Hmm, maybe I can divide all terms by 25 to simplify:

Q² - 28Q + 96 = 0

So, the quadratic equation is Q² - 28Q + 96 = 0.

Wait, let me check the division:

25Q² /25 = Q²

-700Q /25 = -28Q

2400/25 = 96

Yes.

Now I can try to factor this quadratic, or use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 96 and add to -28. Wait, but since the middle term is -28, and the product is +96, both numbers are negative.

Looking for factors of 96 that add up to 28.

Wait, 12 and 8: 12 *8=96, 12+8=20. No.

Wait, 16 and 6: 16*6=96, 16+6=22. No.

Wait, 24 and 4: 24*4=96, 24+4=28. Yes.

But since it's -28, the factors will both be negative.

So, Q² -28Q +96 = (Q -24)(Q -4) = 0.

So, Q = 24 or Q=4.

So the profit is maximized when Q is 24 or 4.

But wait, the options are about B's output, but the options are a mix of numbers. Looking at the options, let's see which options give Q=24 or Q=4.

Looking at the options:

A: 22 and 7 → no

B:21 and8 → no

C:23 and6 → no

D:26 and2 → no

E:24 and4 → yes.

F:25 and3 → no

G:20 and5→ no

H:27 and1→no

I:18 and10→no

J:19 and9 → no

So, the correct output quantities are 24 and 4. So looking at the options, E is 24 and 4. So the answer is E.

The total profit function is given as π = -3000 -2400Q +350Q² -8.333Q³. To find the marginal profit function, we take the derivative of π with respect to Q:

MP = dπ/dQ = -2400 + 700Q - 25Q².

To determine the output quantities that maximize profit, we set the marginal profit equal to zero and solve for Q:

-2400 + 700Q - 25Q² = 0  
25Q² - 700Q + 2400 = 0  
Dividing through by 25: Q² - 28Q + 96 = 0  
Factoring: (Q - 24)(Q - 4) = 0  
Thus, Q = 24 or Q = 4.

From the options provided, the correct output quantities are 24 and 4, which corresponds to option E.
