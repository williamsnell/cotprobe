Okay, so I have this question about the velocity components of a tossed baseball. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on physics, but let me think. The question is about which component(s) of the velocity remain constant when you toss a baseball.

First, I remember that velocity has both magnitude and direction. When you toss something, like a baseball, it's going to move under the influence of gravity. Gravity affects the vertical component, right? So the vertical velocity should be changing because gravity is pulling it down, causing acceleration.

Wait, what about the horizontal component? I think when you toss something, especially if you're throwing it straight up, the horizontal velocity remains constant because there's no horizontal acceleration. But if you're tossing it at an angle, like throwing it with a spin, maybe the horizontal component changes as well. Oh wait, no—when you throw it with spin, the air can cause the ball to curve, but that's about the path, not the velocity components. The horizontal velocity should stay the same because there's no horizontal force acting on it (assuming no air resistance).

So the baseball's velocity has two components: horizontal (x-direction) and vertical (y-direction). The horizontal component remains constant because there's no acceleration in that direction. The vertical component changes because of acceleration due to gravity.

Looking at the options, the question is asking which component(s) can remain constant. So, which options are correct?

Option C says horizontal. That's correct. Option F says vertical. No, because vertical changes. Option D is angular, which I don't think applies here. The angular component would be about rotation, but the question is about velocity components, so that's probably not it. Option G is either of these, but since only horizontal is correct, it's not either of these. Hmm, wait, let me think again.

Wait, the question is what's the correct option. So the correct components are horizontal and vertical? No, because vertical changes. So only horizontal is correct. So the options are:

Options: C is horizontal, F is vertical. So only C is correct. But let me look at the options again.

Wait the options are: 

A: Both horizontal and vertical → No, vertical changes.

B: Diagonal → No, that's the path's direction.

C: horizontal → Yes.

D: Angular → No.

E: Radial → No, radial is like from center to surface, not velocity.

F: vertical → No.

G: Either of these → Only C is correct, and F is no. So G is incorrect.

H: Rotational → No, rotation is about spinning.

I: None of these → No, because C is correct.

J: Tangential → No, tangential is about direction along the curve.

So the correct answer should be C, but wait, what option has horizontal and nothing else? Let me see.

Wait, no, the question is asking which component can remain constant. So the correct components are horizontal (C) and vertical changes (F no). So the only correct option is C.

But wait the options are A to J, each a single choice. So in the options, C is correct because only horizontal is a constant component. So the correct answer is C. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake. Because when you toss a ball, the horizontal component is constant, and the vertical component is changing. So the correct answer is that the horizontal component remains constant. So looking at the options, the correct choice is C.

But wait, the options are:

A: Both → No, vertical changes.

B: Diagonal → No, direction.

C: horizontal → Yes.

D: Angular → No.

E: Radial → No.

F: vertical → No.

G: Either of these → Only C is correct.

H: Rotational → No.

I: None → No.

J: Tangential → No.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Is there any component that's constant? Suppose the ball is thrown straight up, then the horizontal component is constant, and the vertical component is changing. So in that case, only the horizontal is constant. So the correct answer is C. So the answer is C, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again. Let me check. The options are:

Options:

A: Both horizontal and vertical → No.

B: Diagonal → No.

C: horizontal → Yes.

D: Angular → No.

E: Radial → No.

F: vertical → No.

G: Either of these → No, because only horizontal is correct.

H: Rotational → No.

I: None → No.

J: Tangential → No.

So the correct answer is C.

The question asks which component of the velocity remains constant during the tossing of a baseball. When a baseball is tossed, its velocity has two components: horizontal (x-direction) and vertical (y-direction). 

- The **horizontal component** remains constant because there is no horizontal acceleration acting on the ball (assuming no air resistance).
- The **vertical component** changes due to the influence of gravity.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Both horizontal and vertical** → Incorrect, as the vertical component changes.
- **B: Diagonal** → Incorrect, as it refers to the direction of motion, not velocity components.
- **C: horizontal** → Correct, as the horizontal component remains constant.
- **D: Angular** → Incorrect, as angular refers to rotation, not velocity.
- **E: Radial** → Incorrect, as radial refers to radial direction, not velocity.
- **F: vertical** → Incorrect, as the vertical component changes.
- **G: Either of these** → Incorrect, as only the horizontal component is constant.
- **H: Rotational** → Incorrect, as rotational refers to spinning motion, not velocity.
- **I: None of these** → Incorrect, as the horizontal component is constant.
- **J: Tangential** → Incorrect, as tangential refers to motion along a curve, not velocity.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: horizontal**.
