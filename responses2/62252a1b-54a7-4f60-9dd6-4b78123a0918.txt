Okay, so I have this question about economic concepts, specifically about full employment and growth. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking whether full employment is sufficient to maintain growth. The options are A to D. Let me recall what I know about these terms.

Full employment, I believe, refers to a situation where all available resources are being used efficiently, so the economy is operating at the natural rate of unemployment. It's often associated with the idea of full capacity utilization. Full employment can sometimes be divided into different types, like cyclical full employment, where the economy is at potential output, and structural full employment, where the economy is at the natural rate but has structural issues.

Growth, in economics, usually refers to the increase in the economy's output or real GDP over time. Growth can be measured by things like GDP per capita, which is real GDP divided by the population.

So the question is whether achieving full employment ensures that growth continues. Let's look at each option.

Option A: "Growth only depends on full employment." Hmm, I'm not sure about this. I think full employment is a condition that can support growth. If the economy isn't at full employment, there might be opportunities for expansion. For example, if everyone is working and the economy is at its maximum potential, wouldn't growth be hindered? Or maybe it's the oppositeâ€”full employment is a necessary condition for sustained growth.

Option B: "Yes, full employment guarantees growth." That sounds plausible. If the economy is at full employment, maybe it's at the natural rate of output, which is where growth can be sustained because there's no excess capacity. But wait, that's not entirely right. While full employment might prevent inflation, it doesn't necessarily guarantee growth. There could be other factors, like structural issues or long-term planning, that affect growth. So maybe B is not the best answer.

Option C: "Full employment always leads to increasing per capita output." Hmm, per capita output is growth. If full employment is achieved, does it always mean more output? Well, full employment implies that everyone is employed, so if the economy is at potential output, then per capita output would be at its natural level, which might not necessarily mean increasing. It depends on whether the economy is expanding. So if the economy is already growing, full employment might not always increase per capita output. Or wait, no, if it's the natural rate, then per capita output is stable. So C might not be correct.

Option D: "No, full employment is not sufficient for the maintenance of growth." That makes sense. Because while full employment is a necessary condition, it's not enough on its own. There must be other factors at play, like institutions, productivity, and demand. If the economy is at full employment but not growing, it's because there's no demand for goods and services. So full employment alone isn't enough for growth. So D seems correct.

To wrap it up, the question is whether full employment is sufficient for growth. The correct answer would be D because full employment is necessary but not sufficient. Without growth, even with full employment, the economy might stagnate.

The question asks whether full employment is sufficient to maintain growth. Let's analyze the options:

- **Option A** suggests growth depends solely on full employment. This is incorrect because full employment isn't the sole condition for sustained growth; other factors like demand and institutions also play roles.
- **Option B** claims full employment guarantees growth. While full employment at potential output can support steady growth, it doesn't always guarantee growth, especially if demand isn't increasing.
- **Option C** states full employment always leads to increasing per capita output. At the natural rate of unemployment, per capita output might be stable, not increasing, so this is false.
- **Option D** concludes that full employment isn't sufficient for growth. This is correct because growth requires demand as well as the economy being at full employment.

The correct answer is **D**.

Answer: D
