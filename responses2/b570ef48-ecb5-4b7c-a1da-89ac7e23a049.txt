Okay, so I've got this problem here about means. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that the mean of 7 numbers is 15. Then when an 8th number is added, the mean drops to 12. I need to find what the 8th number is.

Wait, I remember that the mean is the sum divided by the number of elements. So, for the first part, the mean is 15 with 7 numbers. That means the total sum of those 7 numbers must be 7 multiplied by 15. Let me calculate that: 7*15 is 105. So the sum of the first 7 numbers is 105.

Now, when we add an 8th number, the total count becomes 8. The new mean is 12. So the total sum after adding the 8th number must be 8*12. Let me compute that: 8*12 is 96. Oh wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, if the mean is decreasing, adding a bigger number might actually decrease the mean. Or wait, adding a number could either increase or decrease the mean depending on where it is. So in this case, the sum went from 105 to 96? That would mean the 8th number is negative because 96 is less than 105. So 105 minus 96 is 9. So the 8th number must be -9? Let me check that again.

Wait, let me recalculate. Original sum is 105. After adding the 8th number, the sum is 8 times the new mean. New mean is 12, so 8*12 is 96. So the 8th number would be 96 - 105 = -9. That makes sense because adding a negative number would decrease the sum, thus lowering the mean.

Looking at the options, option B is -9. So the answer should be B.

The mean of 7 numbers is 15, so the total sum is 105. Adding an 8th number, the new mean is 12, so the new sum is 96. The 8th number is the difference between the new sum and the original sum: 96 - 105 = -9. 

Answer: B
