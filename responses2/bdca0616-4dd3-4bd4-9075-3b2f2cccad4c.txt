Question:

 If it were known that a policy would wipe out several animal species without negatively affecting human beings, Baxter would most likely say that

Options:

A: this policy is morally problematic because it disrupts the natural order.
B: this policy is morally problematic because it negatively impacts biodiversity.
C: this policy is morally acceptable because it does not harm human beings.
D: this policy is morally unproblematic.
E: this policy is morally obligatory because it prioritizes human beings.
F: this policy is morally unacceptable because it eliminates several animal species.
G: this policy is morally obligatory because the environment ought not to exist.
H: this policy is morally problematic because it damages the integrity of the ecosystem.
I: this policy is morally problematic because it harms the environment.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about ethics and policies. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says: If it were known that a policy would wipe out several animal species without negatively affecting humans, Baxter would most likely say that. The options are A to I, each with different moral positions.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on Baxter's ethics, but I think he's known for his anti-Environmentalism and anti-Intergenerationalism, which are parts of his ethical theories. Anti-Environmentalism means he would oppose policies that harm the environment. His arguments are often that the environment is a natural order and should be conserved.

So the policy in question is one that eliminates animal species without harming humans. That definitely reduces biodiversity, which is part of the natural order. Baxter would likely see this as a violation of the natural order, making the policy morally problematic.

Looking at the options:

A: Disrupts natural order. That makes sense because he's anti-Environmentalism.

B: Negative impact on biodiversity. That's a specific point, but the question asks more about Baxter's stance, not the impact itself.

C: Acceptable because doesn't harm humans. No, because he's anti-Environmentalism, so this seems wrong.

D: Unproblematic. No, I think he would see it as problematic.

E: Morally obligatory because prioritizes humans. No, he's not about moral obligation; he's more about ethical principles.

F: Unacceptable because it eliminates species. That's a strong point, but doesn't directly address Baxter's ethical stance.

G: Morally obligatory because environment shouldn't exist. No, that's more about ethics about nature, not anti-Environmentalism.

H: Problematic because it damages ecosystem integrity. That's similar to F.

I: Problematic because it harms environment. So, this is about the environment, which aligns with Baxter's anti-Environmentalism.

Wait, but the question is about Baxter's specific reasoning. So which is more accurate from his perspective? Since he's anti-Environmentalism, the policy's moral issue is about the loss of biodiversity, which is a violation of the natural order. So the correct choice is F: this policy is morally unacceptable because it eliminates several animal species.

Alternatively, option A is another angle but perhaps less specific. So Baxter's stance would focus on the environmental consequences, specifically the loss of biodiversity. So the correct answer is F.

Baxter, known for his anti-Environmentalist stance, would most likely view the policy as morally unacceptable because it negatively impacts biodiversity. This aligns with his belief that the environment is a natural order and should be conserved. 

Answer: F
