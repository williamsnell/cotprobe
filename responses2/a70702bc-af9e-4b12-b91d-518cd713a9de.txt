Okay, so I need to find the probability that a randomly picked point (x, y) from a rectangle satisfies x < y. The rectangle has vertices at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (0,2). Hmm, let me visualize this rectangle first. It's 3 units long along the x-axis and 2 units along the y-axis.

The probability is the area where x < y divided by the total area of the rectangle. That makes sense because the point is chosen uniformly at random. So the total area of the rectangle is 3 * 2 = 6. Now, I need to find the area where x < y.

Wait, but in a rectangle, x and y can't be negative, right? So x ranges from 0 to 3, and y ranges from 0 to 2. Let's think about the line x = y. Where does this line intersect the rectangle?

Well, the line x = y will pass through the origin (0,0) and since y only goes up to 2, it'll intersect the top side of the rectangle at (2,2). But wait, the rectangle's top side is at y=2, so at x=2, y=2 is the point. Beyond that, x would have to be more than 2 to continue, but the rectangle ends at x=3. So the line x=y goes from (0,0) to (2,2). 

Now, in the rectangle, the area where x < y is above the line x=y. But wait, since x can go up to 3, but y only goes up to 2. So for x from 0 to 2, y can be from x to 2. For x from 2 to 3, y can't be greater than 2, which is less than x. So actually, in the rectangle, x < y only happens when x is less than 2, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. For x between 0 and 2, y can be greater than x up to 2. But beyond x=2, y can't be greater than x because y only goes up to 2. So the region where x < y is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). Because from x=0 to x=2, y ranges from x up to 2. 

So the area of this triangle is (base * height)/2. The base is 2 (from x=0 to x=2) and the height is also 2 (from y=0 to y=2). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the triangle is right-angled at (0,0), so the legs are both 2 units long. So area is (2*2)/2 = 2.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the total area is 6, and the area where x < y is 2, so the probability would be 2/6 = 1/3. But that would be option F. Wait, option F is 1/3, which is one of the choices. But wait, I might be missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I should sketch it out. The line x=y starts at (0,0) and goes up to (2,2). The rectangle extends beyond that. So the region x < y is above the line x=y within the rectangle. So from x=0 to x=2, the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). So the area is 2, as I thought earlier, because it's a right triangle with legs of 2 units each. So 2/6 is 1/3. So the probability would be 1/3, which is option F.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach is to set up the integral. The total area is 3*2=6. The area where x < y is the integral from x=0 to x=2 of (2 - x) dx, because for each x, y can go from x to 2. So the integral is [2x - (x^2)/2] from 0 to 2. Plugging in, 2*2 - (4)/2 = 4 - 2 = 2. So area is 2. Hence, probability is 2/6 = 1/3. So option F is correct.

The probability that x < y is the area where x < y divided by the total area of the rectangle. The rectangle has area 6. The region where x < y is a triangle with area 2, so the probability is 1/3. 

Answer: F: \frac{1}{3}
