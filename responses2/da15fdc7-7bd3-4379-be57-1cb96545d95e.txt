Okay, so I have this physics problem here. I'm a bit confused about where to start, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says: The mean temperature of the earth's surface is 288 K. What is the maximum wavelength of the earth's blackbody radiation? And there are several options given, from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the maximum wavelength of blackbody radiation corresponds to the peak of the blackbody radiation curve. Oh right, that's Wien's displacement law. I think Wien's law relates the wavelength of the peak to the temperature.

Wait, what's Wien's law again? Oh yes, it's something like lambda_max times temperature equals a constant. The exact formula is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Right, I think the value of b is approximately 2.8977719e-3 m·K. Oh, but I might have to use this value with some precision.

The temperature given is 288 K. So I can plug that into the formula. Let me calculate lambda_max.

Lambda_max = 2.8977719e-3 m·K divided by 288 K. Let me compute that. 

Wait, 288 divided by 2.8977719e3. Let me see: 2.8977719e-3 is the same as 0.0028977719 meters·K per Kelvin. So dividing 0.0028977719 by 288 K.

Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically. So 2.8977719e-3 / 288.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 2.8977719e-3 is 0.0028977719.

Divide that by 288:

0.0028977719 / 288 = ?

Let me compute 0.0028977719 / 288.

Well, 0.0028977719 divided by 288 is approximately:

Let me think: 0.0028977719 / 288 = approximately 1.006e-5 meters? Because 288 is about 3e2. So 2.897e-3 / 3e2 is approximately (2.897/3) * 1e-5. 2.897/3 is about 0.9657, so 0.9657e-5 is 9.657e-6 meters, which is 9.657e-6 m, or 0.000009657 m. Wait, but that's 9.657e-6, which is 9.657 x 10^-6 meters. Hmm, wait, but let me double-check my calculation.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

2.8977719e-3 is 0.0028977719 meters.

Divide that by 288:

0.0028977719 ÷ 288.

Let me compute 0.0028977719 ÷ 288.

Well, 288 = 2.88e2, so 0.0028977719 / 2.88e2 = (0.0028977719 / 2.88) ) * 1e-2.

Wait, 0.0028977719 divided by 2.88.

Let me compute 2.8977719e-3 / 288.

Wait, 0.0028977719 / 288.

Break it down:

0.0028977719 ÷ 288 = ?

Approximating:

288 * 0.00001 = 0.00288.

So 0.00288 is 288 * 1e-5 (since 288e-5 is 0.00288). The numerator is 0.0028977719, which is a bit more than 0.00288. So the result is just a bit more than 1e-5.

0.0028977719 / 288 = (0.00288 + 0.0000177719) / 288 = (0.00288 / 288) + (0.0000177719 / 288) = 1e-5 + something small.

So 1e-5 is 0.00001. Adding 0.0000177719/288: 0.0000177719 is about 1.777e-5. Divided by 288 is approximately 6.17e-8. So total is approximately 1e-5 + 6.17e-8 = 1.00617e-5 meters, which is 0.0000100617 m.

So lambda_max is approximately 1.006e-5 meters, which is about 1.01e-5 m.

Wait, looking back at the options: Option F is 0.9e-5 m, G is 1.01e-5, H is 1.6e-5, I is 1.5e-5, J is 0.5e-5.

So G is 1.01e-5 m.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check. Let me compute 2.8977719e-3 / 288 = ?

Let me do it in a calculator way.

2.8977719e-3 divided by 288.

2.8977719e-3 is 0.0028977719.

0.0028977719 / 288 = ?

I can write it as 0.0028977719 / 288.

Let me compute 288 into 0.0028977719.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute 288 * 1.01e-5 =?

1.01e-5 is 0.0000101.

288 * 0.0000101 = 0.0029088.

Wait, wait, our numerator is 0.00289777. So 0.0029088 is a bit higher than 0.00289777.

So 1.01e-5 would produce about 0.0029088, but our numerator is 0.00289777, which is a little less than that. So the result is a little less than 1.01e-5.

So 288 * (0.0000100617) = 0.0028977719.

So 0.0000100617 m is 1.00617e-5 m, which is around 1.006e-5.

So lambda_max is approximately 1.006e-5 m, so about 1.01e-5 m.

Looking back at the options, option G is 1.01 x 10^-5 m. So the answer should be G.

To determine the maximum wavelength of the Earth's blackbody radiation at a temperature of 288 K, we use Wien's displacement law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant (\( 2.8977719 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin. Substituting the given values:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.8977719 \times 10^{-3}}{288}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \approx 1.006 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}
\]

This value is approximately \( 1.01 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option G. The other options are either too small or too large compared to the calculated value.
