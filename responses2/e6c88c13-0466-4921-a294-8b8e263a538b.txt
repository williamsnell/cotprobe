Alright, so I have this problem to solve. Let me read it again. It says, "Let n be the product of the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. Find the sum of the digits of n." Then there are options from A to J.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the two smallest 3-digit primes, multiply them together, and then add up the digits of that product. Let's break it down step by step.

First, what's a prime number? A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, primes start from 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on.

Now, the problem is about 3-digit primes. So Iâ€™m looking for primes that are between 100 and 999. The smallest 3-digit number is 100, but that's not prime because it's 10 squared. So the first prime after 100 would be 101.

Wait, let me confirm. Is 101 a prime? Let me think. It's not even, doesn't end with 5, so it's not divisible by 2 or 5. Let's check divisibility by other primes. The square root of 101 is approximately 10.05, so I need to check primes less than or equal to 10. Primes up to 11: 3, 7. 101 divided by 3 is 33.666..., not an integer. 101 divided by 7 is about 14.428..., also not an integer. So 101 is a prime.

Next, the next 3-digit prime after that. Let's see, 101 is the first, so the next one would be 103? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, 103 is actually the next prime after 101, right? Let me double-check. 102 is even, 103 is prime. So 103 is the next 3-digit prime. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, 103 is actually 101 + 2, but is there a prime between 101 and 103? No, 102 is even, 103 is prime. So the two smallest 3-digit primes are 101 and 103.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 101 is the first, then the next is 103. So their product, n, would be 101 * 103.

Let me calculate that. 101 * 100 is 10,100. Then add 101 * 3 = 303, so total is 10,100 + 303 = 10,403. Wait, no, wait. 101 * 103: Let me compute it properly.

Wait, 101 * 103 can be calculated as (100 + 1)(100 + 3) = 100*100 + 100*3 + 1*100 + 1*3 = 10,000 + 300 + 100 + 3 = 10,403. Wait, that's 10,403. Wait, but that can't be right because 101*100 is 10,100, plus 101*3 would be 303, so 10,100 + 303 = 10,403. Hmm, okay.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me check if I did that correctly. Alternatively, 101 multiplied by 103: 103 is 100 + 3, so 101 * 100 is 10,100. 101 * 3 is 303. So together, 10,100 + 303 = 10,403. That seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me check if 103 is indeed the next prime. What about 105? No, 105 is divisible by 5 and 3. 105 is 5*21, which is 5*3*7. So 105 isn't prime. 107? Let me see: 107 is a prime number. Yes, because it's not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Let me check. The square root of 107 is about 10.34, so I need to check primes up to 11. 107 divided by 3 is 35.666... Not an integer. Divided by 7 is 15.285... Also not. So 107 is prime. Therefore, the next prime after 101 is 103, and then 107 comes after that.

Wait, no. Wait, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, etc. So the two smallest would be 101 and 103. So their product is 101 * 103 = 10,403.

Now, the problem says to find the sum of the digits of n. So n is 10,403. Let's write that out: 10,403. The digits are 1, 0, 4, 0, 3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count: 1 (for the ten thousands place), 0 (thousands), 4 (hundreds), 0 (tens), 3 (ones). So the digits are 1, 0, 4, 0, 3. Now, adding them up: 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 8.

Wait, but another thought: 10,403. Let me confirm that. 101 * 103 is 10,403. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me recalculate 101 * 103. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's do it again.

101 * 103 = (100 + 1)(100 + 3) = 100^2 + 100*3 + 1*100 + 1*3 = 10,000 + 300 + 100 + 3 = 10,403. Yeah, that's correct.

So the digits are 1, 0, 4, 0, 3. Sum: 1+0=1, 1+4=5, 5+0=5, 5+3=8.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 101 * 103 in another way to make sure.

Another way: 101 * 103 = (100 + 1)(100 + 3) = 100*100 + 100*3 + 1*100 + 1*3 = 10,000 + 300 + 100 + 3 = 10,403. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another method: 103 * 100 = 10,300. Then add 3 * 103, which is 309. So 10,300 + 309 = 10,609? Wait, no, that can't be right because 103*100 is 10,300. 103*3 is 309. 10,300 + 309 = 10,609? That can't be right because earlier calculation was 10,403. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me do it again.

Wait, 101 * 103: Let me compute 103 * 100 = 10,300. Then 103 * 1 = 103. So 10,300 + 103 = 10,403. That's correct. So 10,403.

Digits: 1 (ten thousands), 0 (thousands), 4 (hundreds), 0 (tens), 3 (units). So digits are 1, 0, 4, 0, 3. Sum is 1+0=1, 1+4=5, 5+0=5, 5+3=8. So the sum is 8.

Looking at the options, option A is 8. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. I'm recalling that sometimes when you're dealing with primes, maybe there's another pair that could give a smaller product. Let me think: the two smallest 3-digit primes are 101 and 103, which are the first two after 100. 100 isn't prime. So the next ones are 101, 103, 107, etc. So their product is 101 * 103, which is 10,403.

Wait, but wait another thing. What about 103 and 107? Are those the next two primes? Or is there a prime between 103 and 107? 103 is a prime. 104 is even, 105 is divisible by 5 and 3, 106 is even, 107 is prime. So 103 and 107 would be the next two. But wait, the problem says the two smallest, so 101 and 103 are the smallest, so 101*103 is the product.

Wait, but I'm wondering if 107 is smaller than 101, but no, 107 is larger than 101. Wait, no, 101 is smaller than 107. So our first two primes are 101 and 103.

So their product is 10,403, and the sum is 8. So the answer should be A: 8.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me double-check the multiplication once more.

101 * 103:

Let me do it as (100 + 1)*(100 + 3) = 100*100 + 100*3 + 1*100 + 1*3 = 10,000 + 300 + 100 + 3 = 10,403. Correct.

So digits: 1,0,4,0,3. Sum: 1+0=1, 1+4=5, 5+0=5, 5+3=8. So yes, sum is 8.

So the correct answer is A:8.
</think>

The two smallest 3-digit primes are 101 and 103. Their product is 10,403. The sum of the digits of 10,403 is 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 8.
