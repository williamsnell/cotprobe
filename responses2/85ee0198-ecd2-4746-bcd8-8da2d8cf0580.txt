Question:

In a code-based phonic approach to early reading instruction, first-grade students are taught the sounds of the letters b, a, s, and g. According to the theory underlying this approach, which of the following will be most effective as the first sentence for the students to read?

Options:

A: Anna has a big dog.
B: A dog bit Ann.
C: Gail has a bag.
D: The cat sat on the mat.
E: Big bags are heavy.
F: Sam has a bag.

H: Bob sang a song.
I: Bob ate a snack.
J: Sally was happy.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a code-based phonic approach to early reading. Hmm, I remember that code-based learning uses sounds to help children recognize letters. So, the question is asking which sentence would be most effective as the first sentence for first graders to learn the sounds of b, a, s, and g.

Wait, what's phonic instruction again? Oh right, it's a method where you teach children to recognize letters based on their sounds. So, the first step would probably be introducing the most common sounds, like the ones for b, a, s, and g.

Looking at the options, each option is a sentence. I think the key here is which sentence would present the letters in a way that their sounds are immediately recognizable. Also, the sentences need to be short and simple, so that kids can understand and remember.

Option A: Anna has a big dog. That's a good example, but it's a bit long. It introduces the words but might not be the first sentence.

Option B: A dog bit Ann. Hmm, that's a trick question. It's checking if they recognize the word 'ann' as having an 'a' sound. But why would that be the first sentence? It's not immediately clear.

Option C: Gail has a bag. Gail and bag both start with 'g' and 'b' sounds. That's a good start because it uses two letters from the target sounds. It's simple and might be the first effective sentence.

Option D: The cat sat on the mat. That's a common rhyme, but it's a sentence that's more about the sequence of letters, not sounds. Also, it's a bit longer than necessary.

Option E: Big bags are heavy. That's a word with 'b' sound, but it's a bit tricky for first graders and not as straightforward.

Option F: Sam has a bag. Sam starts with 's' and has an 'a' sound. That's another good example, but similar to C.

Option G: Gail has a bass. 'Bass' starts with 'b' and has 'a' sound. This is another good example but uses 'bass' which might be a bit more complex for some kids.

Option H: Bob sang a song. That's a song, but it's a longer sentence and not immediately clear.

Option I: Bob ate a snack. That's another trick question, checking if they know 'ate' and 'snack' have 'a' sounds. But it's not the first one.

Option J: Sally was happy. Sally has 's' sound, and 'happy' has 'a' sound. But again, a longer sentence.

So, considering effectiveness, the first sentence needs to be the quickest way for kids to recognize the sounds. Option C, G, F, or B are all good, but I think the correct answer is C because it's a short sentence with two letters from the target sounds. It's straightforward and easy to understand.

Wait, another thought: Option F is Sam has a bag. 'Sam' starts with 's' and 'bag' with 'b' and 'a' sounds. But 'Sam' is a common word, so it's a good example. But perhaps C is better because it's more straightforward and doesn't introduce another word. I think the first sentence should be the most basic, so C is the best choice.

The first sentence should be simple and introduce the target sounds effectively. Option C, "Gail has a bag," is the most effective as it uses two words with the 'g' and 'b' sounds, making it a clear and quick introduction.

Answer: C
