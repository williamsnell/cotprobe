Question:

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee. She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: MRI of the right knee
B: X-ray of the right knee
C: Surgical intervention
D: Physiotherapy
E: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy
F: Nuclear scan of the right knee
G: Antibiotic therapy
H: Corticosteroid injection
I: Application of a knee brace
J: Arthrocentesis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's break it down step by step. The patient is a 14-year-old girl who's been feeling sick for two days. She remembers playing soccer last week and then finishing. She has no rash or joint pain, which is important.

The symptoms are fever, pain, and swelling on the right knee. She can play, so the swelling must be something else. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. 

The exam findings are swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema. Range of motion is limited, so probably a joint issue. Since she was injured last week, maybe there's a tenderness or tenderness but limited range of motion.

She's young, 14, so her condition is probably not something like chronic arthritis. The blood pressure is 110/80, which is a bit high, maybe borderline hypertension. Pulse is 95, which is pretty good, and respiration is 20/min, which is normal, but maybe a bit low for someone on blood pressure.

Looking at the options, let's think about each possibility. The question is about next steps after the exam. The patient has a knee injury, possibly tendinitis or something else.

Option A: MRI. That's expensive, but it's definitely a possibility. If the swelling is severe, especially with limited range of motion, MRI might show something like a tendinitis or even a dislocation if it's too severe.

Option B: X-ray. X-rays can show fractures, tendinitis, or other bone issues. It's another option, but maybe the doctor can do a physical exam first.

Option C: Surgical intervention. If the knee is completely dislocated or there's a tear, surgery is an option. But if it's just tenderness, maybe not.

Option D: Physiotherapy. That's about treatment, like exercises or rest. Since she's able to play, maybe she's in good physical condition, so maybe she needs to rest more.

Option E: NSAID (non-steroidal) drugs. Those are used for inflammation, but she has a history of joint pain, so maybe not. Or she might have a mild inflammation.

Option F: Nuclear scan. Not common, probably not.

Option G: Antibiotic therapy. If inflammation is the issue, antibiotics could help. But she's able to play, so maybe not severe inflammation.

Option H: Corticosteroid injection. That's for inflammation, but again, maybe not if it's not severe.

Option I: Knee brace. If there's tenderness and limited range of motion, a brace could help stabilize the knee.

Option J: Arthrocentesis. That's for appendicitis or other severe joint issues. If the swelling is severe, this might be necessary.

So, putting this together: The patient is injured, shows limited movement, and has a history of knee play. The exam shows tenderness, warmth, but not severe inflammation. So, options like X-ray (B) or surgical intervention (C) are possibilities. But if she can play, maybe she's not too bad.

If it's a shallow injury, like a tendinitis, maybe she needs to rest. So, applying a brace (I) could help. Alternatively, maybe she's in good condition and needs rest. The question is asking for the next step after the exam.

The exam shows limited movement, so I think the brace could help with stability. But if the swelling is severe, that might require surgery. However, the question says she has no rash or joint pain, so maybe it's not a severe condition.

Wait, but the question is about the 'most appropriate next step'. If the patient is able to play, maybe it's not a severe issue. But the knee's swelling is there. So, what's the best option.

I think applying a brace (I) is a common next step if there's tenderness and limited movement, especially if she's able to play. Because if the knee is stable, she can play again.

Alternatively, if it's a tendinitis, she might need to rest but not a brace. However, applying a brace could prevent muscle loss, which is a common issue. So, I think option I is the best next step.

The patient is a 14-year-old girl with a history of a previous knee injury, able to play soccer, and presents with swelling, tenderness, warmth, and limited movement. Based on the exam findings and the patient's ability to play, the most appropriate next step is to apply a knee brace. This would help stabilize the knee and prevent muscle loss, which is a common issue post- knee injury.
