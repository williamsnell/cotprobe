Okay, so I have this question about ResNets and Transformers and their architectures. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives two statements. Statement 1 says that the original ResNets and Transformers are feedforward neural networks. Statement 2 says that Transformers use self-attention, but ResNets don't. I need to determine if each statement is true or false.

Wait, what's the difference between the two? I remember that both ResNets and Transformers are types of deep learning models, but their structures are different.

ResNets, right, ResNet stands for "Residual Network." The term 'Res' probably stands for 'Residual.' I think the original ResNet didn't use any kind of attention mechanism, like self-attention. They just used feedforward neural networks, processing each layer sequentially. Each layer processed the input through some linear transformation and activation, and they added a shortcut connection that bypassed some layers, allowing the loss to be directly backpropagated.

On the other hand, Transformers, which I know are based on the attention mechanism. They use self-attention to weigh the importance of different positions in the input sequence. So, the original Transformer doesn't use feedforward layers but relies entirely on attention. Therefore, the original ResNet doesn't have self-attention.

So looking at the statements:

Statement 1: Both are feedforward. I think that's correct because both are composed of multiple layers, each applying a transformation followed by a non-linear activation, with a skip connection.

Statement 2: Transformers use self-attention, ResNets don't. That's also correct because Transformers use attention, while ResNets don't have any.

So both statements are true.

The two statements are both true. 

1. **ResNets and Transformers are feedforward neural networks.** Both architectures use a sequence of layers to process data, each applying a transformation followed by an activation, with a skip connection for ResNets. Transformers, however, use self-attention.

2. **Transformer uses self-attention; ResNets don't.** Transformers employ attention mechanisms, whereas ResNets rely solely on feedforward processing without attention.

**Answer:** A: True, True
