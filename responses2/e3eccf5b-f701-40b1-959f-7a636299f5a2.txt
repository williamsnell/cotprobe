Okay, so I'm looking at this question about the frustration-displaced aggression theory of prejudice. Hmm, I remember that this theory is related to how people perceive others based on their frustration. Let me try to break it down.

The options are A to J. I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about what each option says.

Option A says it's about a lack of understanding of other cultures. I recall that this theory was developed by Talcott Parsons, right? He believed that people's perceptions are shaped by their own feelings and experiences. So, if someone feels frustrated, they might attribute their behavior to being an aggressionist rather than an actual prejudice. So A might be correct.

Option B talks about learned behavior from parents or society. That sounds more like the social learning theory, not the frustration theory. I think the frustration theory is about internal factors, like frustration, rather than external influences.

Option C mentions personality type. I'm not sure if this theory relates to that. The frustration theory is about how people perceive others based on their own feelings, not their personality. So C might not be right.

Option D says prejudice is innate and can't be changed. That sounds more like the idea that some traits are genetic, which is similar to the social learning theory, not the frustration theory. The frustration theory is more about how individuals react based on their own experiences.

Option E says frustration leads to aggression, and if the frustration is too hard, it's displaced. That sounds a lot like the theory. If someone is frustrated and the frustration is too intense, they might redirect their aggression onto someone else, the scapegoat. So E could be the correct answer.

Option F suggests prejudice is directly proportional to stress. I don't think this is the case; it's more about how stress affects someone's behavior. The theory is about internal emotions leading to external behaviors.

Option G says prejudice is a direct competition for resources. That sounds a bit like the theory of competition, but I'm not sure how it relates to frustration. Maybe not directly.

Option H claims individuals express prejudice when they can justify it with logic or morality. That sounds more like the perspective of the social learning theory, where people observe others' behavior and form their own opinions based on external evidence.

Option I says they express when they feel powerlessness. That's more about self-perception, not how they perceive others.

Option J says people display when they can justify their attitudes with logic. Again, more about belief formation, not the theory's focus.

So, putting it together: the frustration theory is about frustration leading to aggression and displacement. So the correct answer should be E.

The frustration-displaced aggression theory of prejudice is best described by option E. This theory explains that frustration toward a goal can lead to aggression, but if the frustration is too intense or unavailable, aggression may shift to a scapegoat. 

**Answer: E**
