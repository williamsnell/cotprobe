Okay, so I've got this problem about rolling two dice and figuring out the expected gain or loss per game. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question says that two dice are rolled simultaneously. If both show a 6, the player wins $20. Otherwise, the player loses the game, and it costs $2.00 to play. I need to find the expected value of this game to determine whether the player should expect a gain or loss.

Hmm, expected value is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing them up. So, I need to determine the probabilities of each outcome and then calculate the expected gain.

Let me think about the possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Each die has 6 sides, so rolling two dice has 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. 

Now, the favorable outcome for winning is when both dice show 6. There's only one such outcome: (6,6). So the probability of winning is 1/36.

The other outcomes are when at least one die isn't a 6 or when both are 6. The number of non-winning outcomes is 36 total minus 1 winning, so 35. Therefore, the probability of losing (or not winning) is 35/36.

Wait, but the problem says that if both dice show 6, the player wins $20. Otherwise, the player loses the game. Oh, wait, does losing $2.00 mean the player pays $2.00 regardless of whether they lose? Let me recheck the question.

It says, "It costs $2.00 to play the game." So regardless of whether you lose or win, you pay $2.00 to play. So the cost is a fixed cost, not part of the potential gains or losses.

So the possible outcomes are:

- Win $20: probability 1/36.
- Lose $2.00: probability 35/36.

Wait, wait, but perhaps the loss is just the player's own loss, which is the $2 plus any other costs? Or is it just a straightforward loss?

Wait, perhaps the wording is that if both dice are 6, the player gains $20, otherwise, the player's loss is $2.00. So the net gain or loss would be $20 - $2 = $18 if they win, and -$2 if they lose.

But no, wait. Let me read again: "If both dice show 6, then the player wins $20; otherwise the player loses the game." So the loss part is just the $2.00 they pay to play, regardless of whether they lose or win.

So the expected value calculation would be: (Probability of winning * gain) + (Probability of losing * loss).

So, gain is $20, loss is $2, and their probabilities are 1/36 and 35/36 respectively.

So expected value (EV) = (1/36)*20 + (35/36)*(-2).

Let me compute that.

First, 1/36 * 20 is 20/36. 35/36 * (-2) is (-70)/36.

Adding these together: 20/36 -70/36 = (20-70)/36 = (-50)/36.

Simplify that: -50/36 is equal to -25/18. Let's compute that in decimal. 25 ÷ 18 is approximately 1.388... So negative 1.388... which is about -$1.39. Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the player will lose about $1.44. Hmm, that's close to my calculation. But wait, wait—did I do the signs right?

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check. The player wins $20, so gain is +20. If they lose, they pay $2, so the net loss is -2. So, EV = (1/36)(20) + (35/36)(-2).

Calculating that: 20/36 is about 0.5556, and (-2)*35/36 is -70/36, which is approximately -1.9444.

Adding 0.5556 and (-1.9444) gives 0.5556 - 1.9444 = -1.3888, which is approximately -$1.39. 

Looking back at the options, option A says the player will lose about $1.44. But my calculation gives about -$1.39. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me compute 20/36 and 70/36 exactly.

20/36 = 5/9 ≈ 0.5556.
70/36 = 35/18 ≈ 1.9444.
So EV = 5/9 - 70/36. Since 70/36 is 35/18, which is 1.9444.

Wait, 5/9 is about 0.5556. So 0.5556 - 1.9444 = -1.3888, which is about -$1.39.

But the options don't have, say, -1.39 as an option. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Lose about $1.44.

B: Gain about $1.00.

C: Lose about $0.89.

D: Lose about $1.00.

E: Lose about $0.55.

F: Gain about $1.44.

G: Lose about $2.00.

H: Gain about $0.89.

I: Lose about $0.55.

J: Gain about $0.55.

So none of the options exactly match my calculation. Hmm. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the $2 is the cost to play, regardless of outcome. So when you play, you pay $2, and depending on the outcome, you either gain $20 or lose $2.

So the expected value is (Probability of winning) * (20 - 2) + (Probability of losing) * (-2).

Wait, wait that's not right. Because when you win, you gain $20, but you paid $2 to play. So net gain is $20 - $2 = $18. When you lose, you lose the $2, so net gain is -$2.

Wait, so the expected value is (1/36)(18) + (35/36)(-2).

Let me compute that.

1/36 * 18 = (18)/(36) = 0.5.

35/36 * (-2) = (-70)/36 ≈ -1.9444.

So 0.5 - 1.9444 = -1.4444, which is about -$1.44.

Ah, so that's option A, which says the player will lose about $1.44.

So did I make a mistake in the earlier calculation by not subtracting the $2 from the winnings?

Yes, that's where I went wrong. Because when you win, your net gain is $20 (from the game) minus the cost to play ($2), so it's $18. But if you lose, your net gain is -$2 (because you pay $2 to play but don't win anything, so you lose the $2).

So the correct calculation is EV = (1/36)*18 + (35/36)*(-2).

Which gives us 0.5 - 1.9444 = -1.4444, approximately -$1.44.

Looking at the options, option A is the player will lose about $1.44, which matches this calculation.
</think>

The expected value calculation considers the net gain or loss for each outcome. When both dice show 6, the player wins $20, but they pay $2 to play, resulting in a net gain of $18. Otherwise, the player loses the $2. The probabilities are 1/36 for winning and 35/36 for losing. Thus, the expected value is (1/36)*18 + (35/36)*(-2) = -1.44, indicating a loss of approximately $1.44.
