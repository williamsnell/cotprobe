Okay, so I have this problem here about a college graduate borrowing $8000 to buy a car, and the interest rate is 10% annually. They want to know the monthly payment required to pay off the loan in 3 years. Hmm, I remember this is a common type of question about amortizing loans. Let me try to break it down.

First, I think I need to calculate the monthly payment using the formula for an amortizing loan. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I recall something like this: 

The formula for the monthly payment (P) is P = [r * PV] / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]

Where:
- r is the monthly interest rate
- PV is the present value, which is the loan amount here ($8000)
- n is the number of payments, which would be 3 years * 12 months = 36 months.

Wait, the annual interest rate is 10%, so the monthly rate should be 10% divided by 12. Let me calculate that. 10% is 0.10, so 0.10 / 12 is approximately 0.008333 per month.

Now, plugging into the formula: 

P = (0.008333 * 8000) / (1 - (1 + 0.008333)^-36)

First, calculate the numerator: 0.008333 * 8000. Let's see, 8000 * 0.008333 is approximately 66.664.

Denominator: 1 - (1.008333)^-36. Hmm, I need to compute (1.008333)^-36. Wait, (-36) power. Alternatively, (1.008333)^36 is e^(36 * ln(1.008333)). Let's compute ln(1.008333): approximately 0.008275. Multiply by 36 gives about 0.2973. So e^0.2973 is about 1.346. So (1.008333)^36 ≈ 1.346. So (1.008333)^-36 is approximately 1/1.346 ≈ 0.7427.

So denominator is 1 - 0.7427 = 0.2573.

Now, P = 66.664 / 0.2573 ≈ Let's calculate that. 66.664 / 0.2573. Hmm, 0.2573 * 258 is about 66.66 (since 0.2573 * 250 = 64.325, and 0.2573*8=2.0584; 64.325+2.0584=66.3834). So about 258. So the monthly payment is approximately $258.14.

Looking at the options, option C is $258.14. So the correct answer should be C.

To determine the monthly payment required to pay off a $8000 loan at an annual interest rate of 10% over 3 years, we use the amortizing loan formula:

**Monthly Payment (P) = [r * PV] / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]**

Where:
- r = monthly interest rate = 10% / 12 ≈ 0.008333
- PV = $8000 (loan amount)
- n = number of payments = 3 years * 12 = 36 months

**Calculations:**
- Numerator: 0.008333 * 8000 = 66.664
- Denominator: 1 - (1.008333)^-36 ≈ 0.2573

**Monthly Payment (P) = 66.664 / 0.2573 ≈ $258.14**

**Answer:**
C: $258.14
