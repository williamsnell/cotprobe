Question:

A landlord was the owner of a large, high-rise apartment building in a Midwestern city. On June 1, 2007, two tenants took possession of a three- bedroom apartment in the landlord's building under a three-year lease at a rental of $1,200 per month. Their lease (as all other leases given by the landlord) contained the following provisions:"The term of this lease shall be three years from the date hereof as long as all the agreements herein shall be faithfully performed. "The two tenants lived in the apartment for two years. On June 10, 2009, however, a fire destroyed the apartment building. As a result, all the apartments in the building were rendered uninhabitable. After the two tenants were dispossessed from their apartment, the landlord brought suit against them to recover the rent due for the balance of the lease. The two tenants claim that they are no longer liable for rent or any other obligations under the lease. The landlord  tenants leasehold contract contained no provision regarding liability for fire.

Options:

A: the two tenants did not cause the fire.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the scenario is about a landlord who owns a large, midwestern city apartment building. On June 1, 2007, two tenants took possession of a three-bedroom apartment under a three-year lease. The rent is $1,200 per month. The lease says that the term is three years from now as long as all the agreements are faithfully performed.

Then, on June 10, 2009, a fire destroyed the apartment building, rendering all apartments uninhabitable. The tenants were dispossessed, and the landlord sued them to recover the rent for the balance of the lease. The tenants claim they aren't liable for rent or other obligations. The question is about what the court would likely conclude, given the lease's provisions.

The question is about the landlord's obligation to cover the rent in the case where the building was destroyed by a fire. The options are A to J, each with different possible outcomes.

First, I need to understand the lease terms. The lease says the term is three years from now, as long as all agreements are faithfully performed. So the lease explicitly doesn't mention anything about liability for a fire. That's important because if the lease didn't include a clause about the landlord being liable for the fire, then the landlord could be at risk of having to pay the tenants back.

Under common law, the tenant's duty to pay rent is based on the assumption that the landlord will maintain the property. If the landlord doesn't maintain it, the tenant can't claim their rent as paid. But in this case, the landlord didn't maintain the property—he had a fire, so he had to either replace the building or find another tenant.

So, the landlord is liable for the rent because he's responsible for maintaining the property. The lease's clauses don't include any such provision, so the landlord can't claim that they're not liable.

Looking at the options:

Option H says "the lease was not fully completed due to the fire." That doesn't make sense because a lease being fully completed usually refers to the landlord and tenant's agreement, not the condition of the property. The problem is the landlord's maintenance, not the lease's terms.

Option E says the landlord failed to maintain the property, which would make the landlord liable. So if E is correct, the landlord can sue the tenants for the rent.

Wait, but the question says the two tenants are suing to get back the rent. So the landlord's liability is to pay the tenants. If the landlord didn't maintain the property, he's liable for the rent. But the lease didn't state anything about the landlord's duty to maintain the property, so it's up to the landlord to do so.

So the court would likely decide that the landlord is liable because he failed to maintain the property, hence the tenants are not liable. That would make the answer E.

Wait, but let me think again. The lease's terms don't mention any liability. So the landlord's obligation to maintain is not covered by the lease. So if the landlord didn't maintain, he's responsible for the rent. So the landlord is liable, and the tenants are not. Therefore, the court would likely find that the landlord was negligent in failing to maintain, leading the tenants to be liable.

So the correct answer should be E: the landlord failed to maintain the property resulting in the fire.

Looking back at the options, E is one of them. So that's probably the answer.

The landlord's liability stems from the failure to maintain the property, which resulted in the fire. Since the lease did not specify a duty to maintain the property, the landlord's action is the determining factor. The court would likely find the landlord negligent and liable for the rent, as he failed to maintain the property. This makes option E correct.

**Answer: E**
