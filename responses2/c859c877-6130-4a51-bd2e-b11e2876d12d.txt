Okay, so I've got this real estate tax question here, and I'm a bit nervous because real estate can be tricky. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the problem says Mr. Golden owns a property valued at $16,500. But wait, the city's assessed value is 40% of the actual value. Hmm, I remember that the assessed value is like the value assigned by the city, not the actual market value. So, the assessed value would be 40% of $16,500. Let me calculate that.

40% is the same as 0.4 in decimal. So, 0.4 multiplied by $16,500. Let me do that. 0.4 * 16,500. Let's see, 0.4 times 10,000 is 4,000, and 0.4 times 6,500 is 2,600. Wait no, wait. 16,500 is 16.5 thousand. So 0.4 * 16.5 is 6.6, so 6.6 thousand, which is $6,600. So the assessed value is $6,600.

But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the assessed valuation is 40% of the actual value, which is the market value. So, the assessed value is 40% of the market value. So, 40% of $16,500 is indeed 6,600. So the assessed value is $6,600.

Next, the tax rate is 21.3 mills per dollar. Oh right, I think a mill is a thousandth of a dollar, so 1 mill is $0.001. So 21.3 mills per dollar would be 21.3 * $0.001 = $0.0213 per dollar. Wait, no, wait. Wait, a mill is 1/1000 of a dollar, so 1 mill is $0.001. So 21.3 mills would be 21.3 * $0.001 = $0.0213 per dollar. Hmm, but I think the tax rate is per dollar of assessed value, not actual value. Because in real estate, the tax is usually based on the assessed value, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The tax rate is applied to the assessed value. So, the tax amount is the assessed value multiplied by the tax rate.

So, the tax would be $6,600 (the assessed value) multiplied by 21.3 mills per dollar. Wait, but wait, 21.3 mills is 21.3 per 1000 dollars. So, 21.3/1000 dollars is a mill. So 21.3 mills is 21.3*(1/1000) = 0.0213 dollars per dollar. Wait, no, wait. No, wait, wait. The tax rate is 21.3 mills per dollar. So, per $1, it's 21.3 * 0.001 = $0.0213. So, for each dollar of assessed value, the tax is $0.0213. So, the total tax would be 6,600 * 0.0213.

But wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, the tax rate is 21.3 mills per dollar. Since 1 mill is $0.001, 21.3 mills is 21.3 * 0.001 = $0.0213 per dollar of assessed value. So, yes, that's correct.

So, 6,600 multiplied by 0.0213. Let me calculate that. Let's break it down. 6,600 * 0.02 is 132, and 6,600 * 0.0013 is 8.58. So adding those together, 132 + 8.58 = 140.58. So the total tax would be $140.58.

Looking at the options, option H is $140.58. So that would be the answer.
</think>

The assessed value of the property is 40% of the market value, which is 0.4 * $16,500 = $6,600. The tax rate is 21.3 mills per dollar, which converts to $0.0213 per dollar of assessed value. 

Calculating the total tax:
\[
\text{Tax} = \$6,600 \times 0.0213 = \$140.58
\]

The correct answer is **H: $140.58**.

Answer: H
