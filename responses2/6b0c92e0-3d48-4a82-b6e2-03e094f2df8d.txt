Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is: "Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad." And I need to pick the correct translation into predicate logic from the options given.

Hmm. Predicate logic involves translating statements into symbols, right? So I need to break down the sentence into its components. The main idea here is that Caroline's sweetness is directly tied to Janet being engaged to Brad. It's an "if and only if" condition, which means both statements are equivalent.

Let me think about the parts. "Caroline is sweet" – that's probably an atomic proposition, so maybe it's represented as Sc, where S stands for "is sweet" and c for Caroline. Similarly, "Janet is engaged to Brad" – maybe that's E, representing "engaged to" and j for Brad. So Ej would mean Janet is engaged to Brad.

So the statement is saying that Caroline is sweet (Sc) if and only if Janet is engaged (Ej). An "if and only if" in logic is a biconditional, which is represented by the double arrow, like ↔. So in symbols, it's Sc ↔ Ej.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Sc ≡ Ej. That's exactly what I thought. The ≡ symbol is used for equivalence, so that should be correct.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure none of them fit.

Option A: Sx ≡ Jy. That seems to mix the subjects. It's saying Caroline is sweet (if x is a subject, maybe it's better to think of x as the property or the object). Wait, maybe Sx is about Caroline, x is a variable. Jy is about Janet. So this doesn't match the subjects as in the statement.

Option B: Ej ≡ Cs. That would mean Janet is engaged (Ej) if and only if Caroline is sweet (Cs). That's the same as option C, just swapping the variables. But in the original statement, it's Caroline being sweet, so Sc ≡ Ej is correct.

Option D: Cs ⊃ Ej. That's a conditional. It would mean if Caroline is sweet, then Janet is engaged. But the statement says both conditions are equivalent. So this is a one-way implication, not a biconditional.

Option E: Se ≡ Cj. Se is Caroline being sweet, Cj is Janet being engaged to someone else? Wait, Cj would require someone to be Brad, but the original says "Brad", so maybe this is incorrect.

Option F: Sj ≡ Ce. Sj is Janet is sweet, Ce is Caroline engaged to someone? Doesn't fit.

Option G: Cj ⊃ Es. Cj is Janet engaged, so if she's engaged, then ... wait, in the statement, it's about Caroline being sweet. So this might not fit.

Option H: sC ≡ eJ. Wait, sC is "Caroline is sweet" (because s is the subject, C is the predicate for being sweet?), and eJ is "Janet is engaged to Brad". So this would mean "Caroline is sweet if and only if Janet is engaged to Brad." That's exactly what we need.

Wait, but in predicate logic, the subject is what's being predicated on. So if Sx is "x is sweet", then Sc would be "Caroline is sweet." Similarly, Ej is "Janet is engaged to Brad." So the correct biconditional is Sc ≡ Ej, which is option C.

But wait, option H is written as "sC ≡ eJ." Let me parse that. "sC" is "Caroline is sweet"? Or is "s" the subject and "C" the predicate. So maybe "sC" means "Caroline is sweet," right? Because s is an object constant, and C is the predicate. So "sC" is Sc, same as before. Similarly, "eJ" is "Janet is engaged to Brad."

So option H is "sC ≡ eJ," which is the same as option C: Sc ≡ Ej.

Wait, but that can't be right because in logic, the order matters. Wait, no: in predicate logic, the variables are bound, so the order in the equivalence doesn't affect the meaning. So Sc ≡ Ej is the same as sC ≡ eJ. So both options C and H are correct? That can't be because the options should have unique correct answers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me look again.

Option C: Sc ≡ Ej.

Option H: sC ≡ eJ. So, sC is Caroline's state, eJ is engaged to Brad.

So both are correct, but they are identical. That doesn't make sense because this is a multiple-choice question expecting only one correct answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the options. Let me read them again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Sc ≡ Ej.

Option H: sC ≡ eJ.

Wait, the same variables but different order. So Sc ≡ Ej and sC ≡ eJ would be the same because "Sc" is Caroline is sweet, same as "sC" is Caroline is sweet. Similarly, Ej is Janet engaged to Brad; eJ is same as Ej because "e" is the subject and "J" is the predicate. So both expressions mean the same thing, just written differently. So both C and H are correct, which can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Are any of the options not correct? Let me think again about the original statement.

Original statement: Caroline is sweet if and only if Janet is engaged to Brad.

Expressed as Sc ↔ Ej.

So in predicate logic, that's Sc ≡ Ej. So option C is correct.

Option H is written as sC ≡ eJ, which is the same as Sc ≡ Ej. So H is also correct. But in the options, it's presented as H: sC ≡ eJ. But in the problem, the options are presented as A to J, and each is a separate option.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me check again. Oh, no, the options are:

A: Sx ≡ Jy

B: Ej ≡ Cs

C: Sc ≡ Ej

D: Cs ⊃ Ej

E: Se ≡ Cj

F: Sj ≡ Ce

G: Cj ⊃ Es

H: sC ≡ eJ

I: Cs ≡ Bj

J: Cb ≡ Je

So, option C is Sc ≡ Ej, and option H is sC ≡ eJ.

But if sC is Caroline's state, and eJ is engaged to Brad, same as Sc and Ej.

Wait, but in logic, the variables are bound, so it's a matter of how the variables are used. So Sc is the same as sC, and Ej is the same as eJ. So both expressions are equivalent. So both C and H are correct, which can't be the case because each option is distinct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the translation. Let me think again about the statements. The correct translation is Sc ↔ Ej. So in options, C is Sc ≡ Ej, which is the same because ≡ is for equivalence, so it's correct.

H is sC ≡ eJ. Since sC is Caroline is sweet, and eJ is engaged to Brad, which is the same as Sc and Ej.

Wait, but in terms of the variables, the options are written with s and e as constants, and C and J as predicates. So sC is Caroline's state, eJ is engaged to Brad. So option H is the same as option C, written with 's' and 'e' swapped. Wait, but that's not correct because 's' would be the same as 'C' in the predicate.

Wait, no. 's' is a constant; it's the object. So 'sC' is "Caroline is S" where S is the property. Similarly, 'eJ' is "Janet is engaged to J" (Brad). So 'sC' and 'eJ' are both predicates applied to the subjects. So both options C and H correctly represent the same meaning, just written differently.

Wait, but that would imply that both C and H are correct answers, but the problem expects only one correct option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are written differently, and I need to look at them again.

Wait, let me read each option again:

Option C: Sc ≡ Ej. Correct translation.

Option H: sC ≡ eJ. Which is the same as Sc ≡ Ej. So both are correct, but in a multiple-choice question, this can't happen. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe 'sC' is 'Caroline is sweet' and 'eJ' is 'Janet is engaged to Brad'. So option H is correct.

But wait, in option H, the subject is 'sC', which is Caroline's state, and 'eJ' is engaged to Brad. So both are correct. But the options are presented as separate choices, so if both are correct, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the question uses 's' and 'e' as in "sC" meaning 'Caroline is sweet' and 'eJ' meaning 'Janet is engaged to Brad.' So the correct way is option C.

Wait, but perhaps I should look at the answer options again. The question is from a test, and each option is a separate choice. So if both option C and H are correct, that's impossible because each option is unique. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I've misread the options. Let me check the structure again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Sx ≡ Jy → No, because it's not about the right subjects or predicates.

B: Ej ≡ Cs → No, because Ej is about Janet, Cs is about Caroline.

C: Sc ≡ Ej → Correct.

D: Cs ⊃ Ej → Only if, not biconditional.

E: Se ≡ Cj → Se is Caroline, Cj is engaged to someone else, probably incorrect.

F: Sj ≡ Ce → Sj is Janet, Ce is engaged to someone else. Doesn't fit.

G: Cj ⊃ Es → If Janet is engaged, then... no, the original says the equivalence.

H: sC ≡ eJ → Correct, same as C.

So the correct options are C and H, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps the person who wrote the question made a mistake, but I should proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think: the original statement is "Caroline is sweet if and only if Janet is engaged to Brad." So in logic, that's Sc ↔ Ej. So in predicate logic, that's Sc ≡ Ej. So option C is correct.

Option H is sC ≡ eJ, which is the same as Sc ≡ Ej. So both are correct, but that's impossible in the options. So perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the options are presented so that each is a single choice. So perhaps the problem is that I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps 'sC' is 'Caroline is sweet' and 'eJ' is 'Janet is engaged to Brad'. So option H is correct.

But then why are options C and H both correct? That can't be. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option that correctly uses the right variables.

Wait, if I look at option H: sC ≡ eJ. 'sC' is Caroline is sweet. 'eJ' is engaged to Brad. So that's correct.

In option C, 'Sc' is Caroline sweet, 'Ej' is engaged to Brad. So both are correct, but they are written differently.

Wait, but the problem is that in predicate logic, the order of the variables doesn't matter. So sc ≡ ej and sC ≡ eJ are the same.

But in the options, they are presented differently. So perhaps both options C and H are correct, but the problem expects only one answer. That's impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is C, because option H's structure is the same as C, just written with 's' and 'e'.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the sentence again: "Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad." So it's a biconditional. So in logic, it's Sc ↔ Ej, which is equivalent to Sc ≡ Ej.

So option C is correct.

Option H is written as sC ≡ eJ, which is also correct because sC is Caroline is sweet, and eJ is engaged to Brad.

Wait, but that's the same as option C. So perhaps both are correct, but I can't choose both. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the options. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but I'm to proceed with my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C because it directly captures the variables correctly.

Wait, but in the options, option H is sC ≡ eJ. So that's the same as Sc ≡ Ej. So both expressions are correct. But in the problem, each option is a distinct choice. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C because it's the standard way of translating this. So I'll proceed with that.

The correct translation is Caroline being sweet (Sc) if and only if Janet is engaged to Brad (Ej), which is represented as Sc ≡ Ej.
