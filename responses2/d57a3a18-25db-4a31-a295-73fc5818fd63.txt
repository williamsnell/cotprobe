The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A shopper in a store sees that a display case is about to fall on a second shopper's head. The shopper does nothing to warn or assist the second shopper, who is a stranger to her. She could have taken action to protect the second shopper without harming herself. Did the shopper have a duty to take action to try and protect the second shopper from injury?

Options:

A: No, the shopper is not required to intervene unless she is a store employee or security personnel.
B: Yes, the shopper must take action under the "Good Samaritan" law.
C: Yes, the fact that a person sees that action is needed for another's aid or protection does impose a legal duty to act.
D: No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself.
E: Yes, the shopper is legally obligated to intervene because she was the first person to notice the danger.
F: Yes, the shopper is legally obligated to intervene in any potentially harmful situation.
G: Yes, the shopper must take action under the "last clear chance" doctrine.
H: No, a failure to act does not and cannot result in liability under any circumstances.
I: No, the shopper is not required to intervene unless she has a special relationship with the person in danger.
J: No, the shopper has no duty to act unless she directly caused the danger.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about a shopper who sees another person in danger and does nothing to help them. They're wondering if they had a duty to take action to protect the other shopper without harming themselves.

Hmm. So, the options are A to J. I need to evaluate each one. Let me think about each option step by step.

Option A says: No, the shopper isn't required unless she's an employee or security. Well, I remember that sometimes stores have security measures, but it's not a hard rule. So, maybe this isn't always the case. But I'm not sure if it's a legal obligation every time or only sometimes.

Option B: Yes, she must take action under the Good Samaritan law. I'm not sure. I thought Good Samaritan applies to helping someone in need, but does that mean the shopper has to do it even if it's not harmful? Or does she have to take action because she's responsible for others?

Option C: Yes, seeing the danger imposes a duty. That rings a bell. There's a principle called the duty of care, where someone has a duty to help others in danger. So, if a person sees another person in danger, they have a duty to act. But is it just about the duty, or does it depend on whether the action is harmful?

Option D: No duty because it can be done without hurting herself. Wait, that seems contradictory. If the other person is a stranger, she can't do much. The shopper can't help without herself being injured, right? So, she has a duty to act.

Option E: She's obligated because she was first. No, the first person doesn't necessarily mean she must act. It's about whether she's in a position of responsibility.

Option F: She must act in any harmful situation. That sounds too broad. Maybe the duty applies only in certain cases.

Option G: She has to act under the "last clear chance" doctrine. I'm pretty sure that's from the Federal Trade Commission's guidance. It says if someone sees danger, they have the right to act, but it's not mandatory. So, the shopper doesn't have to act unless they have a clear last chance.

Option H: No duty unless she caused the danger. Hmm, but the other shopper is a stranger. She didn't cause the danger; she just saw it. So, the shopper might have a duty regardless of whether she caused harm.

Option I: No duty unless she has a special relationship. The shopper wasn't an employee or security person, so maybe no special relationship. So, she doesn't have to act.

Option J: No duty unless she caused the danger. But again, the shopper didn't cause it; she just saw it. So, no duty, because it wasn't her fault.

Wait, so the question is about whether she had a duty to act. Let's think about the legal principle. The duty of care applies. If a person is in danger, they have a duty to help. But this duty might be to take action regardless of whether it's harmful. Alternatively, if the action is harmful, the person might be required to do it.

I recall the "good Samaritan" doctrine, which applies to providing aid. So, if the other shopper is in danger, the shopper must act to help. But is that always the case, or does it depend on whether it's harmful?

The question says she did nothing, but she could have taken action to protect without herself being hurt. So, she had a duty to act to protect, even if she wasn't harmful. That would make option B or C correct.

Wait, what about the "last clear chance" doctrine? That's a legal principle where if someone is in danger, if they have a last chance to act, they must. But the shopper didn't cause the danger. So, perhaps the duty isn't mandatory unless they have such a last chance.

The question is about whether she had a duty to take action. So, under the duty of care, she should have a duty to help. But does that apply even if she's not harming herself? Or does a duty to protect someone without harming oneself depend on whether it's required.

I think the duty of care principle makes her have a duty, but the specific legal doctrine might vary. But the question is whether there's a duty, regardless of the legal framework.

Wait, also, there's the idea that the duty is to act to protect others, regardless of whether it's harmful. But if the action wasn't harmful, then does the duty still apply, or is there a reason she shouldn't have acted?

In the case where the other person is a stranger, the shopper can't help much. So, she must act to protect, but perhaps her duty is to take action even if it's not harmful. So, she had a duty.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Yes, the fact that a person sees that action is needed for another's aid or protection does impose a legal duty to act.

That seems to fit. Because the existence of another in danger requires the shopper to act to help. So, the duty is imposed by the necessity of aiding someone in need.

Option B says she must take action under the Good Samaritan law, which might apply, but the duty could be broader than that.

So, between C and B.

Option B says she must take action under Good Samaritan, which is a specific law. The duty of care is more general. So, perhaps the correct answer is C, which is a more general legal principle.

Alternatively, the question is about whether she had a duty to take action, regardless of the legal framework, but the duty is an obligation to act to protect others, even if harmful.

Wait, the original question is about whether she had a duty to take action to protect the second shopper without harming herself. So, in that case, she must act to protect, but perhaps she didn't have to harm herself because she was the one who was in danger.

Wait, but if she's the one who can't do much, she must take action regardless. So, the duty is to act, but if she can't act, perhaps she must.

So, the correct answer is C. Because the duty arises from the necessity of helping someone in danger, regardless of whether the action is harmful. The duty is an obligation to act to protect the other, even if she can't do anything herself.

The question revolves around whether a shopper had a duty to take action to protect a stranger without harming herself. The analysis considers various legal principles and options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because while security might be required in some contexts, it's not a universal legal obligation.
- **Option B** is incorrect as it focuses on the specific doctrine of Good Samaritan, which applies to helping others but doesn't necessarily equate to a duty in this scenario.
- **Option C** is correct because the duty of care applies, requiring the shopper to act to protect someone in danger, even if harmful action is avoided.
- **Option D** is incorrect because the other shopper (a stranger) can't do much, leading to a duty to act.
- **Option E** is incorrect because there's no requirement to act unless there's a last clear chance.
- **Option F** is incorrect because there's no requirement to act in any harmful situation.
- **Option G** is incorrect due to the "last clear chance" doctrine, which isn't mandatory unless applicable.
- **Option H** is incorrect because there's no duty unless the shopper was at fault.
- **Option I** is incorrect because no special relationship is required.
- **Option J** is incorrect because there's no duty unless the shopper caused the danger.

The correct answer is **C**, as the duty of care requires the shopper to act to protect the stranger without harming herself, even if it's not harmful.
