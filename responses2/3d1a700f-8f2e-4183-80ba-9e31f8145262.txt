Question:

In the extreme case, $ 1,000 of new reserves put into a bank will ultimately result in an increase of $ 5,000 of bank de-posits, assuming that the reserve ratio is 20%. But in reality this is rarely the case. What stops the extreme case from being realized?

Options:

A: A decrease in the money supply by the central bank
B: Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio
C: Low bank deposits
D: Excessive regulation of the banking industry
E: Increase in government borrowing crowding out private lending

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the reserve ratio and how it affects the money supply. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says that if a bank puts in $1,000 of new reserves, it would ultimately result in an increase of $5,000 of bank de-posits, assuming a 20% reserve ratio. But in reality, this extreme case isn't realized because of various factors. The options are about what stops this extreme case.

Hmm, I remember that the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold as reserves. So, if the ratio is 20%, banks must keep 20% of their deposits and set aside the rest. The rest can be lent out, which increases the money supply because those loans become deposits in other banks, leading to more money creation.

Wait, so the basic equation here is the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So 1/0.2 is 5. That means for every dollar deposited, the potential money supply expansion is multiplied by 5. So 1,000 would become 5,000, which matches the question.

But why isn't this happening in reality? The question says that the extreme case rarely occurs. What factors could prevent this?

The options are A to E. Let me go through them. 

A: A decrease in the money supply by the central bank. I don't think this would stop the extreme case because the central bank's actions might influence the reserve ratio. If the central bank lowers the reserve ratio, banks would hold less, allowing more loans out, hence more money creation. So A might be a possibility, but I'm not sure if that's the primary reason.

B: Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio. Oh, wait! If banks don't hold the required reserves, their excess reserves can be lent out. So suppose a bank has $1,000 in deposits. Normally, it holds 20% ($200) as reserves and lends out $800. But if the reserve ratio is not maintained, the bank might keep less. Let's say it holds only 10% of deposits as reserves. Then it would lend out $900. So the initial $1,000 becomes $1,000 (deposits) plus $900 (lent out) = $1,900 in deposits, which can then be lent out further. This would cause a larger increase. So the money supply would expand more than the 5x multiplier. So the extreme case (5x) wouldn't happen because the banks are not adhering to the reserve ratio, allowing for more expansion than the multiplier would suggest.

Wait, but the question is about the 'extreme case' which assumes perfect adherence. So if banks don't do that, the money supply would increase beyond 5x. So B is a factor that stops the extreme case because it allows for more money creation.

C: Low bank deposits. If banks have less deposits, then when they receive more money from other banks, they might not lend as much, or their reserves might be lower. So the money supply might not increase as much as the multiplier suggests. But I'm not sure if that's the primary reason the extreme case isn't realized. I think that would affect other factors, maybe, but maybe not the main reason.

D: Excessive regulation of the banking industry. If regulations are too strict, banks might not be able to meet the reserve requirements, leading to more excess reserves. So, when the central bank's actions are limited, the banks can lend more, leading to a bigger money supply expansion. But this might not be the main reason the extreme case isn't happening. Unless regulation is limiting how much the banks can hold, which could reduce the reserve ratio even further.

E: Increase in government borrowing crowding out private lending. When the government borrows, it might use funds that could have been lent out to private sectors. This would reduce private lending, thus the money supply might not expand as much as the multiplier suggests. So this could be a reason the money growth isn't as high as the extreme case. But I'm not certain if this is the primary reason the extreme case isn't happening. Alternatively, if the government borrows and uses funds that private banks cannot lend to, it could reduce private lending, which might not allow the banks to reach the full 5x expansion.

So, the options are B and E. Wait, the question is which factor stops the extreme case. The extreme case is when banks maintain the reserve ratio exactly. If they don't, they can allow more loans, so the money supply increases beyond the 5x. So the extreme case is when they do maintain the ratio, so any deviation would prevent that.

So the factors that prevent the extreme case are those that allow the reserve ratio to be violated. So the correct answer is B or E.

Alternatively, E says government borrowing crowding out. If the government borrows, it might not be available for private lending. So private banks can't lend as much, so the money supply doesn't expand as much as the multiplier. So when the central bank doesn't have enough reserves, the banks can't lend as much. So the money multiplier is reduced. So if the government borrows, making the reserve ratio lower, then the money multiplier would be lower than 5. So the money supply increases by less than 5x, hence not the extreme case.

So which option is it? Let's see the options again:

E: Increase in government borrowing crowding out private lending.

Yes, this would reduce the money multiplier. So without the extreme case.

So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but in the question, the extreme case isn't realized. So if the government borrows, maybe the banks can't lend their excess reserves, so the money supply doesn't grow as much as the multiplier suggests. So the money multiplier is effectively less than 5, thus not the extreme case.

So the answer is E.

The question asks which factor prevents the extreme case of $1,000 of reserves leading to a $5,000 increase in bank de-posits, assuming a 20% reserve ratio. The extreme case occurs when banks adhere strictly to the reserve ratio. 

To prevent this, various factors must allow banks to either violate the reserve ratio or reduce the money multiplier. Here's the analysis of the options:

- **A: A decrease in the money supply by the central bank**  
  The central bank's actions might influence reserve ratios, but this is not the primary reason the extreme case (full 5x expansion) doesn't occur.

- **B: Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio**  
  If banks do not maintain the reserve ratio, they hold less reserves, allowing more loans to be lent out. This increases the money supply beyond the 5x multiplier, thus preventing the extreme case.

- **C: Low bank deposits**  
  Low deposits could reduce lending, but this affects other factors like the money multiplier, not the extreme case directly.

- **D: Excessive regulation of the banking industry**  
  Regulation could reduce the reserve ratio, thereby limiting the money multiplier and preventing the extreme case.

- **E: Increase in government borrowing crowding out private lending**  
  Government borrowing might reduce private lending, lowering the money multiplier and preventing the extreme case. The reserve ratio would be lower, as the government's funds are not available for lending.

The correct answer is **E**, as government borrowing can reduce private lending, thereby limiting the money multiplier and preventing the extreme case of full 5x expansion.
