Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I observe the great and wonderful mistake, both our own and our fathers, as to the civil powers of this world, acting in spiritual matters. I have read…the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground…"

Alright, so I've got this question about the Puritan emigration in the 17th century, specifically regarding the situation in New England between 1649 and 1660. The question is asking why the settlers were not moving out during that time.

First, I need to recall what I know about the Puritans and their religious practices. The Puritans, as followers of John Calvin and John Keely, were deeply involved in religious and political life. They had strict beliefs about the state and the government, believing that the Church was the final authority. Their government was based on the idea that the people should control the state through elected officials, not the Church.

When the Dutch and other settlers arrived, they were supposed to convert the local population. But the Puritans didn't show much interest. They had a system where the church could't pass laws, so the settlers were concerned. They were worried about the Church's influence and the possibility that the new rulers might start a new church, which would contradict their religious beliefs. This was a big deal because they were advocating for a separation of church and state.

So, the main reason for the slowdown was probably their belief in the authority of the Church. They didn't want to be influenced by it anymore. Additionally, they were concerned about the potential for conflict with other religious groups, which would undermine their authority. The settlers didn't want to risk the reputation of the Church as a governing body, so they prioritized their own religious authority.

Looking at the options, option B says the New England settlements became overcrowded, and the colonial legislatures discouraged immigration. That fits because overcrowding would make it harder for settlers to convert, and the lack of a strong church or government would make it hard for the settlers to get people on board.

Other options might relate more to specific events. For example, the answer isn't about disease (option D), because then they would have moved. The government didn't ban emigration (option G), which would have prevented it. Option E is about heresy, but the question is about religious influence, not belief. Option F is about disease, which is unrelated. Option H is a civil war, which wasn't starting because the issue was more about religious authority and the state, not political conflicts. Option I is about incentives, which doesn't apply here. Option J is about incentives, same reasoning as I.

So the correct answer should be B: the New England settlements became too overcrowded, and colonial legislatures discouraged immigration.

The reason the New England settlers remained in the region despite the Dutch' arrival was due to their concerns about the Church's authority and potential conflicts. They believed the state should be governed by elected officials, not the Church. This led to overcrowding and discouragement by colonial legislatures.

**Answer: B**
