Okay, so I've got this problem about Susan Wane and Dolly Watson investing money in a corkscrew factory. They made $24,200, and I need to figure out how they'll split the profits. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says they invested $35k and $20k respectively. The total investment is $55k, right? And they're sharing the profits equally after each getting 8% interest on their investments.

Hmm, so each of them gets 8% interest. Let me calculate that. 

For Susan: 8% of $35,000 is 0.08 * 35000. Let me compute that. 0.08 times 35,000. 35,000 divided by 100 is 350, times 8 is 2800. So Susan gets $2,800.

Dolly's 8% is 0.08 * 20,000. That's 1,600. So together, the interest is $4,400.

But the total profit is $24,200. So after taking out the interest, the remaining is to be split equally. Wait, no, wait. The question says they share the profits equally after each receives 8% interest. So I think the 8% interest is taken first, and then the remaining profit is split equally.

So the initial step is to subtract the interests from the total profit.

Let me do that. Total profit is $24,200. Subtract the total interest of $4,400. So 24,200 minus 4,400 is 19,800.

Now, this $19,800 is to be split equally between them. So each gets half of that, which is 9,900.

So Susan gets her interest plus her share of the profit. 2,800 + 9,900 = 12,700.

Dolly gets 1,600 + 9,900 = 11,500.

Wait, looking at the options: Option D says Wane gets 12,700 and Watson gets 11,500. That matches what I calculated.

Alternatively, let me cross-verify. Another way is to compute each's share of the profit after the interest. So total after interest is 24,200 - 4,400 = 19,800. Each gets half, 9,900.

So, for Susan: 2,800 (interest) + 9,900 (profit share) = 12,700.

Dolly: 1,600 + 9,900 = 11,500.

So the correct option is D.

The correct distribution is calculated by first determining each investor's interest (8%) and then splitting the remaining profit equally. 

- **Susan Wane's interest**: 8% of $35,000 = $2,800.
- **Dolly Watson's interest**: 8% of $20,000 = $1,600.
- **Total interest**: $2,800 + $1,600 = $4,400.
- **Remaining profit**: $24,200 - $4,400 = $19,800.
- **Split equally**: $19,800 / 2 = $9,900 for each.
- **Susan's total**: $2,800 + $9,900 = $12,700.
- **Dolly's total**: $1,600 + $9,900 = $11,500.

The correct option is D.
