Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two simple pendulums. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So, the question says that pendulum A and B have the same mass, but their string lengths are different, L_A and L_B. They're oscillating in the same gravitational field. The period of B is twice that of A. I need to find the relationship between L_A and L_B.

Wait, I remember that the period of a simple pendulum is given by the formula T equals 2π times the square root of (L/g), right? So T = 2π√(L/g). Oh wait, but wait, the formula is T = 2π√(L/g). So the period depends on the square root of the length divided by gravitational acceleration. Since the gravitational field is the same for both, the g is the same for both pendulums. So g cancels out in the ratio of periods.

So, given that T_B is twice T_A, let's write that down. T_B is twice T_A. So, T_B = 2 T_A. Using the formula, T_B = 2π√(L_B/g) and T_A = 2π√(L_A/g).

Substituting, 2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * [2π√(L_A/g)].

Wait, let me compute that correctly. The equation is T_B = 2 T_A. So,

2π√(L_B/g) = 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)).

Wait no, no. Wait, T_A is 2π√(L_A/g), so T_B is 2 T_A. So the equation is:

2π√(L_B/g) = 2*(2π√(L_A/g)).

Simplify the right side: 2 * (2π√(L_A/g)) = 4π√(L_A/g). Wait, no, wait. That can't be right. Wait, 2 T_A is 2*(2π√(L_A/g)) which is 4π√(L_A/g). Wait, no, 2T_A would be 2*(2π√(L_A/g)) = 4π√(L_A/g). Hmm, but let's proceed step by step.

Alternatively, let's square both sides to make it easier. So,

(2π√(L_B/g))² = (2 * 2π√(L_A/g))².

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because T_B is 2 T_A, so (T_B)^2 = (2 T_A)^2 = 4 (T_A)^2.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to take the ratio of the periods.

T_B / T_A = 2.

But T = 2π√(L/g), so the ratio becomes (2π√(L_B/g)) / (2π√(L_A/g)) ) = 2.

The 2π cancels, and the g cancels. So √(L_B) / √(L_A) ) = 2.

Which means √(L_B / L_A) = 2. Therefore, L_B / L_A = 4. So L_B = 4 L_A. So the length of B is four times that of A.

Looking at the options, option E is L_B = L_A /4, no, that's not. Option I is L_B =4 L_A. So that's option I. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: L_B = 1/2 L_A → no.

B: L_B =5 L_A → no.

C: L_B=6 L_A → no.

D: L_B = L_A → no.

E: L_B= L_A /4 → no.

F: L_B=1/4 L_A → no.

G: L_B=2 L_A → no.

H: L_B= L_A /3 → no.

I: L_B=4 L_A → yes.

J: L_B=3 L_A → no.

So the correct answer is option I, which is L_B =4 L_A.

To determine the relationship between the lengths \( L_A \) and \( L_B \) of two simple pendulums A and B, we use the formula for the period of a simple pendulum:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
\]

where \( T \) is the period, \( L \) is the length of the pendulum, and \( g \) is the gravitational acceleration. Since both pendulums operate in the same gravitational field, \( g \) is constant for both. The problem states that the period of pendulum B is twice that of pendulum A, i.e., \( T_B = 2T_A \).

Using the formula for the periods:

\[
T_B = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_B}{g}}, \quad T_A = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_A}{g}}
\]

Taking the ratio of the periods:

\[
\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \frac{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_B}{g}}}{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L_A}{g}}}
\]

The \( 2\pi \) and \( g \) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \sqrt{\frac{L_B}{L_A}}
\]

Given \( T_B = 2T_A \), we substitute:

\[
2 = \sqrt{\frac{L_B}{L_A}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
4 = \frac{L_B}{L_A}
\]

Thus:

\[
L_B = 4L_A
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is:

**E: \( L_B = \frac{L_A}{4} \)**
