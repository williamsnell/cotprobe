Okay, I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it says that all the electrons in a gram of copper could be moved to a position 30 cm away from the copper nuclei. The question is asking what the force of attraction between these two groups would be. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that Newton's law of gravitation is involved here. Oh right, the gravitational force between two masses. But wait, copper is a metal, so it's a conductor, and the electrons are in the outer shells, right? So each electron would be 30 cm away from the nucleus.

First, I think I need to calculate the number of electrons in a gram of copper. Because if I can find that, I can find the charge, and then use Coulomb's law to find the force.

So, let's start with the atomic structure of copper. Copper has an atomic number of 29, meaning each copper atom has 29 protons and 29 electrons. The atomic weight of copper is about 63.55 g/mol. That's the molar mass.

I need to find out how many atoms are in a gram of copper. So, using the molar mass, 1 gram of copper is 1 / 63.55 mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by about 63.55 is approximately 0.01574 mol.

Each mole of copper has 6.022e23 atoms (Avogadro's number). So the number of atoms per gram is 0.01574 * 6.022e23. Let me compute that. 0.01574 * 6.022e23 is approximately 9.48e21 atoms per gram.

Each atom has 29 electrons, so the total number of electrons in a gram is 29 * 9.48e21. Let me compute that: 29 * 9.48e21 is about 274.9e21, which is 2.749e23 electrons.

Wait, but wait, that's the number of electrons. But each electron has a charge. So the total charge Q is 2.749e23 * (-1.6e-19) Coulombs. Let me calculate that. 2.749e23 * 1.6e-19 = approx 4398.4e4 C? Wait, no, 2.749e23 * 1.6e-19 = 4.398e4 C? Wait, no, 2.749e23 * 1.6e-19 is 2.749 * 1.6 * 1e4 = 4.3984e4. Oh wait, that's 43,984 Coulombs? That's a huge charge. But wait, wait, wait a second. No, wait because 2.749e23 * 1.6e-19 is 2.749 * 1.6 = 4.3984, and 1e23 * 1e-19 is 1e4. So 4.3984e4 C? Wait, no, because 2.749e23 is 2.749 × 10^23 and 1.6e-19 is 1.6 ×10^-19. So 2.749e23 *1.6e-19 = (2.749 * 1.6) ×10^(23-19)= 4.3984 ×10^4 C, which is 43,984 Coulombs. An enormous charge.

Wait, that can't be right. Because a gram of copper is a small amount, but with 29 electrons each, so 29 * 2.7e23 = 7.8e24 electrons? Wait, no, let's recalculate.

Wait, 1 gram is 1/63.55 mol. So 1/63.55 = approx 0.01574 mol.

Each mole has 6.022e23 atoms. So 0.01574 * 6.022e23 = 9.48e21 atoms per gram.

Each atom has 29 electrons. So 9.48e21 *29 = 2.749e23 electrons.

Ah, that's correct.

So, the total charge Q is 2.749e23 * (-1.6e-19 C) = 2.749e23 * 1.6e-19 * (-1) = (2.749 *1.6)e(23-19) * (-1) = 4.3984e4 * (-1) = -4.3984e4 C. So the charge is about -4.4e4 C.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Wait, that's 44,000 coulombs. But that's the total charge. So, in Coulomb terms, that's a huge charge.

But wait, wait. Let me recheck the calculations.

Number of atoms per gram: 1 g / 63.55 g/mol = ~0.01574 mol.

Atoms per gram = 0.01574 * 6.022e23 = 9.48e21 atoms.

Electrons per atom: 29. So 9.48e21 *29 = 2.749e23 electrons.

Charge: 2.749e23 * (-1.6e-19 C) = 2.749 * 1.6 = 4.3984e4 C (since 1e23 * 1e-19 is 1e4). So yes, 4.3984e4 C.

Wait, but that's about 44,000 Coulombs. But wait, that seems way too high. Because one Coulomb is a huge charge. Wait, but 1 C is like 3e10 elementary charges. Hmm, so 4.4e4 C is 4.4e4 /3e10 = 1.47e-6 elementary charges. That doesn't make sense because electrons are elementary particles. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of electrons.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the number of electrons per atom. Copper has atomic number 29, so 29 electrons per atom. So 9.48e21 atoms *29 e- = 2.749e23 e-.

Now, charge per electron is e = 1.6e-19 C. So Q = 2.749e23 * 1.6e-19 C.

Wait, 2.749e23 * 1.6e-19 = (2.749 *1.6) e (23-19) = 4.3984e4 C. So yes, 4.3984e4 C. That's 43,984 C. So the total charge is 43,984 C. Hmm, but in terms of Coulomb's law, that seems way too big.

Wait, but wait. Coulomb's law is F = (k Q1 Q2) / r².

But the problem says "moved to a position 30 cm away". So the distance between the electrons and the nuclei is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters.

Wait, but the force would be enormous. But the options given are on the order of 1e21 to 1e26 dyne. So, let's compute it.

Wait, let me think about the units. The given options are in dyne. One dyne is 1e-5 Newtons. So, 1 N = 1e5 dyne.

So, to find F in dyne, I can compute F in Newtons and then multiply by 1e5.

Wait, Coulomb's law in SI units is F = (k * |Q1 * Q2| ) / r², where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988e9 N m²/C²).

So, let's compute F in Newtons.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Q1 = Q2 = 4.3984e4 C.

r = 0.3 m.

So F = (8.988e9) * (4.3984e4)^2 / (0.3)^2.

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

First, (4.3984e4)^2 = (4.3984)^2 * (1e4)^2 = 19.347 * 1e8 = 1.9347e9 C².

Denominator: (0.3)^2 = 0.09 m².

So F = 8.988e9 * 1.9347e9 / 0.09.

Compute the numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.9347e9 = (8.988 *1.9347) * 1e18.

Let me compute 8.988 * 1.9347. 8 * 1.9347 is approximately 15.4776. 0.988 *1.9347 is about 1.908. So total around 15.4776 + 1.908 = 17.3856. So approximately 17.3856e18.

Wait, wait: 8.988e9 is 8.988 *1e9. 1.9347e9 is 1.9347 *1e9. So when multiplied, it's 8.988 *1.9347 * 1e9 *1e9= 8.988 *1.9347 *1e18.

So 8.988 *1.9347 ≈ 17.385.

So 17.385e18 = 1.7385e19.

Divide by 0.09 (since denominator is 0.09):

1.7385e19 / 0.09 = (1.7385 /0.09) * 1e19.

1.7385 divided by 0.09 is approximately 19.3167.

So 19.3167e19 N.

Wait, so F ≈ 1.93167e20 N.

Wait, that's in Newtons. But the options are in dyne, which is 1e-5 N. So we need to convert this to dyne.

Multiply by 1e5: 1.93167e20 * 1e5 = 1.93167e25 dyne.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.9 ×10^25 dyne.

Hmm, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the numbers?

Wait, let me re-calculate the steps.

First, number of electrons.

1g of copper: 1/(63.55) ≈ 0.01574 mol.

0.01574 * 6.022e23 ≈ 9.48e21 atoms.

9.48e21 *29 e- = 2.749e23 e-.

Charge: 2.749e23 * 1.6e-19 C = 4.3984e4 C.

Wait, that's correct.

Coulomb's law: F = (k Q1 Q2 ) / r².

k =8.988e9 N m²/C².

So k * (4.3984e4)^2 = 8.988e9 * (approx 1.927e9) = let me compute accurately.

(4.3984e4)^2 = (4.3984)^2 *1e8.

4.3984 squared: 4^2 is 16, 0.3984*2*4= ~3.187, and 0.3984^2≈ 0.1587. So 16+3.187=19.187, plus 0.1587=19.3457. So approx 19.3457e8 = 1.93457e9.

So, 8.988e9 * 1.93457e9 = (8.988 *1.93457) * 1e18.

Compute 8.988 *1.93457:

Let me compute:

8 *1.93457 =15.47656

0.988 *1.93457 ≈ 1.908 (since 0.9 *1.93457 =1.7411, and 0.088 *1.93457≈0.1708 → total 1.7411+0.1708=1.9119)

Total is 15.47656 +1.9119=17.38846.

So 17.38846e18 = 1.738846e19.

Divide by r², which is 0.3^2=0.09.

1.738846e19 / 0.09 = 1.738846e19 * (1/0.09) = 1.738846e19 * (100/9) ≈ 1.738846e19 * 11.1111.

1.738846e19 * 10 is 1.738846e20, *1.1111 is approx 1.912. So total around 1.912e20 N.

Wait, so F=1.912e20 N.

Convert to dyne: since 1 N =1e5 dyne.

So 1.912e20 N = 1.912e25 dyne.

Looking at the options, E is 1.9 ×10^25 dyne. So that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we calculate the electrostatic force between the electrons and the nuclei of a gram of copper using Coulomb's law. Here's the analysis:

1. **Number of electrons in 1 g of copper**:  
   - Molar mass of copper is approximately 63.55 g/mol.  
   - Number of moles in 1 g of copper:  
     \[
     \frac{1}{63.55} \approx 0.01574 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
   - Number of atoms per gram:  
     \[
     0.01574 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \approx 9.48 \times 10^{21} \, \text{atoms}.
     \]  
   - Each copper atom has 29 electrons, so total number of electrons:  
     \[
     9.48 \times 10^{21} \, \text{atoms} \times 29 \, \text{electrons/atom} \approx 2.749 \times 10^{23} \, \text{electrons}.
     \]

2. **Total charge of the electrons**:  
   - Charge per electron is \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).  
   - Total charge:  
     \[
     Q = 2.749 \times 10^{23} \, \text{electrons} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C/electron} \approx 4.3984 \times 10^{4} \, \text{C}.
     \]

3. **Force using Coulomb's law**:  
   - Coulomb's constant: \( k = 8.988 \times 10^{9} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \).  
   - Distance between electrons and nuclei: \( r = 30 \, \text{cm} = 0.3 \, \text{m} \).  
   - Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     F = \frac{k Q_1 Q_2}{r^2}.
     \]  
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     F = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^{9}) \times (4.3984 \times 10^{4})^2}{(0.3)^2}.
     \]  
   - First, calculate \( (4.3984 \times 10^{4})^2 \):  
     \[
     (4.3984)^2 \approx 19.347 \, \text{C}^2, \quad (4.3984 \times 10^{4})^2 \approx 1.9347 \times 10^{9} \, \text{C}^2.
     \]  
   - Next, calculate the numerator:  
     \[
     (8.988 \times 10^{9}) \times (1.9347 \times 10^{9}) \approx 1.7388 \times 10^{19} \, \text{N·m}^2.
     \]  
   - Finally, divide by \( r^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09 \):  
     \[
     F = \frac{1.7388 \times 10^{19}}{0.09} \approx 1.912 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N}.
     \]

4. **Convert to dyne**:  
   - \( 1 \, \text{N} = 10^5 \, \text{dyne} \).  
   - \( F = 1.912 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N} \times 10^5 = 1.912 \times 10^{25} \, \text{dyne} \).

5. **Compare with options**:  
   - The closest option is \( 1.9 \times 10^{25} \, \text{dyne} \), which corresponds to option **E**.

ANSWER: E
