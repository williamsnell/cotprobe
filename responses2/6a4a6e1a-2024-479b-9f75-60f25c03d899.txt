Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is: Six 6-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers? The options are given from A to J, each with a different fraction.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some basics about dice and prime/composite numbers. A standard die has six faces numbered 1 through 6. Now, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, looking at the numbers on a die:

1 is not prime, 2 is prime, 3 is prime, 4 is not, 5 is prime, 6 is not. So the primes on a die are 2, 3, 5. That's three numbers. So each die has 3 primes.

Then there's composite numbers. Composite numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are not prime, meaning they have factors other than 1 and themselves. On a die, the composite numbers are 4 and 6. So that's two composite numbers.

Wait, what about 1? 1 is neither prime nor composite. Oh, so each die has three outcomes: prime (2,3,5), composite (4,6), and 1 (neutral). So for each die, the probability of getting a prime is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2. Composite is 2/6, which is 1/3. And 1 is 1/6.

But wait, the problem says that we need three primes and three composites out of six dice. So we have to calculate the probability of exactly three primes and three composites in a roll of six dice.

I think this is a binomial probability problem. The formula for that is n choose k multiplied by (p)^k multiplied by (1-p)^(n-k). But wait, in this case, each die can be either prime, composite, or neither (1). So I think the formula still applies here.

Wait, but wait a second. Each die has three outcomes: prime (3 outcomes), composite (2 outcomes), and neither (1 outcome). So the probabilities for each outcome aren't equal. So I can't just use the binomial formula directly because the probabilities are different for each category.

Hmm, so I need to calculate the probability that exactly three dice show primes and exactly three show composites. So for each die, the chance of being prime is 3/6 = 1/2, composite is 2/6 = 1/3, and neither is 1/6.

So the probability is the number of ways to choose which three dice are primes multiplied by the probability of each of those three being primes and the other three being composites.

So the number of ways is the combination of 6 dice taken 3 at a time, which is 6 choose 3. That's 20.

Then, for each of those ways, the probability is (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^3. Because each selected die has a 1/2 chance of being prime, and the remaining three have a 1/3 chance of being composite.

So the total probability is 20 * (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^3.

Let me compute that. First, (1/2)^3 is 1/8, (1/3)^3 is 1/27. Multiplying those together: 1/(8*27) = 1/216. Then, 20 times that is 20/216. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 4: 5/54. Wait, because 20 divided by 4 is 5, and 216 divided by 4 is 54. So 5/54.

Looking at the options, option B is 5/54. So that's the probability.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to think about it: the dice are independent, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6^6, which is 46656. But calculating that might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can cross-verify.

Alternatively, the problem is about multinomial coefficients. We can model it as the number of ways to have exactly three primes, three composites, and zero neither in six dice. So the multinomial coefficient is 6!/(3!3!0!) which is 720/(6*6*1) = 720/36 = 20.

Then, each of those 20 arrangements has a probability of (3/6)^3 * (2/6)^3 * (1/6)^0, which is (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^3. Which is again (1/8)*(1/27) = 1/216. Multiply by the number of arrangements (20) gives 20/216 = 5/54. So that's consistent with option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says 'three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers.' So the dice can't show 1. So in the calculation, we have considered that, because the probability of neither is 1/6, which is included in the 6th die's probability.

Wait, but the question doesn't state that all dice must show either prime or composite, just that three show primes and three show composites. So 1s are allowed in the remaining dice.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that exactly three show primes, and the other three show composites, regardless of what the 1s are. Which is what the calculation does. So yes, 20 ways, each with (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^3.

So that gives 5/54, which is option B. So the correct answer is option B.

The probability of rolling exactly three primes and three composites out of six dice is calculated by considering the combinations and probabilities of each outcome:

1. **Number of ways**: Choose 3 dice out of 6 to show primes, which is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
2. **Probability per combination**: Each chosen prime die has a \( \frac{1}{2} \) chance, and each chosen composite die has a \( \frac{1}{3} \) chance. The probability for each specific combination is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{27} = \frac{1}{216} \).
3. **Total probability**: Multiply the number of ways by the probability per combination: \( 20 \times \frac{1}{216} = \frac{20}{216} = \frac{5}{54} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **B: \(\frac{5}{54}\)**.
