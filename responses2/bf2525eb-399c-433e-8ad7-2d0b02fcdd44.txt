The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Which statement best describes the circumstances that have shaped the emergence of peace studies as a field of research?

Options:

A: Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide.
B: Peace studies developed during the 1960s and 1970s as a reaction to the civil rights movement and anti-war protests, focusing on social justice issues and the role of nonviolent resistance in promoting peace.
C: Developed as a response to World War I, peace studies focuses on disparities in wealth and resource allocation that exist within the global system, with the aim of promoting peace through the equal distribution of these resources.
D: The field of peace studies emerged during the Cold War, primarily focusing on the East-West divide and the potential for nuclear war, with a secondary focus on the impact of war on the environment.
E: Peace studies emerged as a field of research in the post-Cold War era, largely driven by the need to understand and address the root causes of internal conflicts and civil wars.
F: Developed during the era of decolonization, peace studies focuses on the legacy of colonialism and its impact on conflicts and tensions in the global South.
G: Peace studies developed as a discipline following the Cold War when the security studies paradigm shifted to include areas of concern such as environmental, societal and economic security. As a field of research peace studies adopts a Euro-centric approach to security and has thus been defined by developments within the West and wealthier nations.
H: Peace studies emerged as a response to the developing nuclear capability of states during the Cold War. The aim of peace studies is to secure the state as a referent object and does this through the study of weapons accumulation. The approach is particularly focused on the nuclear arms race between East and West.
I: Peace studies emerged in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, primarily focusing on the issues surrounding war atrocities and the impact of war on civilian populations.

Okay, I have to choose the correct answer for this multiple-choice question about the emergence of peace studies. Let's go through each option carefully.

The question asks which statement best describes the circumstances that shaped the emergence of peace studies. So, I need to think about when and why peace studies developed.

I remember that peace studies as a field started developing in the mid-20th century. The options mention various eras, like WWII, Cold War, 1960s-70s, etc. Let me break down each option.

Option A says it developed after WWII as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict after WWII I. Initially, it was conditioned by the Cold War, including issues like nuclear arms race, East-West divide, environmental concerns, and North-South wealth/poverty divide. That sounds plausible. The Cold War was a period when tensions between superpowers and their regions were high, leading to specific issues that drove the development of peace studies.

Option B talks about the 1960s-70s reaction to civil rights and anti-war protests. That seems more about social justice and non-violent resistance, which is part of peace studies, but it's not the main driver, especially before the Cold War.

Option C mentions World War I and focuses on disparities in wealth and resource allocation. That seems too specific and early, perhaps. Also, it implies equal distribution, which peace studies might not have focused on as much.

Option D mentions Cold War and East-West divide, nuclear war, and environmental issues. It says peace studies emerged during the Cold War, focusing on these aspects. But the question is about when, not just the Cold War.

Option E says peace studies emerged after the Cold War, driven by understanding and addressing internal conflicts and civil wars. That seems more modern, but I'm not sure when exactly.

Option F is about decolonization and colonialism's impact on conflicts. That's more about the impact of global events rather than the field's development.

Option G mentions security studies shifting to include broader security concerns and a Euro-centric approach. That's more about the theoretical shift, not the emergence.

Option H states that peace studies emerged as a response to Cold War states' nuclear capabilities and focused on studying weapons accumulation. That's a good point, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit.

Option I says peace studies emerged after the Vietnam War, focusing on war atrocities and war impacts on civilians. That's more of a specific area within peace studies, like domestic violence or post-war impacts.

So, the key points are:
- The Cold War (before and after) was a major factor.
- The emergence was probably due to tensions between superpowers, especially regarding the arms race, economic policies, and regional divisions.

Option A's description fits because it talks about the Cold War era, which was a critical time for peace studies. It mentions issues like nuclear arms race, East-West, environmental concerns, and North-South issues, which are all key aspects that drove the field's development. 

Wait, but option H also talks about nuclear capability and weapons accumulation. H might be more about the actual study, but I'm not sure if that's the best answer. The question is about the circumstances that shaped the field, so the emergence itself is more about the reasons behind it, which would be the Cold War context. 

So, option A seems the best fit because it describes the context (Cold War) and the specific issues that initially drove the field.

The correct answer is A: Peace studies developed after the Cold War as a response to the tensions between superpowers, particularly concerning issues like nuclear arms race, economic policies, and regional divisions. These factors shaped the field by highlighting the need to address global conflicts and regional disparities.
