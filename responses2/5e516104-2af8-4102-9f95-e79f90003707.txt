Okay, so I've got this question about polio and the options given. I'm a bit rusty on my immunology, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see.

The question is asking which of the options can eradicate polio. I remember that polio is a highly infectious disease, so its eradication probably relies on vaccines because they target the virus.

Looking at the options: 

A: Herbal remedies. I think polio is still treatable with medication, but herbal remedies probably don't work as effectively. They might help with symptoms, but the disease itself is still managed by antibiotics.

B: Use of antibiotics. Antibiotics are the mainstay in fighting bacterial infections. Since polio is caused by a virus, antibiotics are the first line of defense, so this is likely a good answer.

C: Regular intake of vitamins. Vitamins, especially B12, are important for fighting infections. But polio remains a big challenge, so maybe not the primary solution.

D: Administration of tetanus vaccine. Oh wait, tetanus is a different disease. Polio is caused by a different virus, so a tetanus vaccine wouldn't help with polio. So D is probably not correct.

E: Attention to sewage control and hygiene. This seems more about public health and preventing disease spread than directly attacking the virus. I'm not sure if this is relevant here.

F: Natural immunity acquired through exposure. While natural immunity is a big part of why some diseases can be eradicated, polio is a virus, not a bacterial infection. Natural immunity might be a factor, but it's not the main way to tackle it. Plus, the question is about eradication, which usually relies on medication.

G: Use of antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs like antivirals against polio are a standard treatment. They're used during the vaccination campaigns, which are the main way to stop polio from spreading.

So putting it together: the main ways to prevent polio are vaccination and antiviral treatments. Looking at the options, G is about antiviral drugs, which are a key part of the solution. The other options are either supportive measures or not directly related to the disease.

The eradication of polio primarily relies on vaccination and antiviral treatments. Among the options, the correct answer is G: Use of antiviral drugs, as these are essential in fighting the disease.

Answer: G
