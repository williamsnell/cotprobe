Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2^1001 - 1 and 2^1012 - 1. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with exponents and GCDs, there's a formula or theorem that might help here. Let me think.

Oh right, there's a property where the GCD of 2^a - 1 and 2^b - 1 is equal to 2^GCD(a,b) - 1. Is that right? I think so. So if I can find the GCD of 1001 and 1012, then I can apply this formula.

Wait, let me confirm that formula. Suppose d is the GCD of a and b. Then GCD(2^a -1, 2^b -1) should be 2^d -1. Yeah, I remember that from number theory. So applying it here, I need to find GCD(1001, 1012).

How do I compute that? Well, I can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let's set a=1012, b=1001.

So step by step:

1012 divided by 1001 is 1 with a remainder of 11. Because 1001*1=1001, subtracting that from 1012 gives 11.

Now, replace a with 1001 and b with 11.

1001 divided by 11. Let's see, 11*91 is 1001, exactly. So the remainder is 0.

So the GCD is 11. Wait, because when the remainder becomes zero, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

So GCD(1012,1001) is 11.

Then, applying the formula, the GCD of 2^1001 -1 and 2^1012 -1 is 2^11 -1. Let me calculate that.

2^11 is 2048. Subtract 1 gives 2047. So the GCD should be 2047.

Looking at the options, option I is 2047. So the answer is I.

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(2^{1001} - 1\) and \(2^{1012} - 1\) can be found using the property that \(\gcd(2^a - 1, 2^b - 1) = 2^{\gcd(a, b)} - 1\). 

First, compute \(\gcd(1001, 1012)\) using the Euclidean algorithm:
- \(1012 \div 1001 = 1\) with remainder \(11\)
- \(1001 \div 11 = 91\) with remainder \(0\)

Thus, \(\gcd(1001, 1012) = 11\).

Applying the formula:
\[
\gcd(2^{1001} - 1, 2^{1012} - 1) = 2^{11} - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047
\]

The answer is I: 2047.
