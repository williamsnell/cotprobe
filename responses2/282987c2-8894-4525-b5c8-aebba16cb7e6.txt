Okay, so I have this question about remarriages and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down.

The question asks about the frequency of remarriages. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the one that's correct.

I remember that remarriage refers to getting married after someone else has already married. It's a common thing, but I'm not sure about the statistics. Let me think about what I know.

Option A: More frequent for men than women. Hmm, I think that's not right. From what I've read, there's no inherent difference in the frequency of remarriage between men and women. It might depend on cultural factors, but it's not a strict rule.

Option B: Illegal in most countries. No, I don't think that's true. Most countries have legal procedures for remarriage, especially after someone has already been married. It's probably common across the globe.

Option C: Most common among those who have never been married before. That sounds plausible. I think many people choose to remarriage after they're married, so this could be correct.

Option D: Typically more successful. I'm not sure. It depends on the individual's circumstances, but I don't recall that it's a general trend. Some people might succeed, others might not.

Option E: Always unsuccessful. No, that doesn't make sense. Many people successfully remarriage, especially if the partner is a good fit.

Option F: Always successful. That's probably incorrect. It's rare, and success depends on a lot of factors like the person being remarried to, the new spouse's behavior, and the new couple's relationship.

Option G: More frequent for women than men. I don't remember any preference between genders in this aspect. It's a common occurrence regardless of gender.

Option H: Typically less successful. Again, I'm not sure. It's possible that some people may have a harder time, but it's not a typical outcome.

Option I: Only allowed after a certain period of time. That doesn't sound right. Many people can remarriage right away if they choose to do so.

Option J: Most common among those who have been married multiple times before. Yes, that makes sense. People often decide to remarry after they've already been married, so this would be a common scenario.

So, looking at the options, C and J both seem plausible. Wait, but the question is about the last character of the answer. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A through J, and the answer choices are letters. So each option is a letter, and the correct answer is one of them. The question isn't asking me to choose between the letters but to pick the correct statement.

Wait, the options are about what is true about remarriages. So, which of these statements is correct?

C says most common among those who have never been married before. That's correct because many people choose to start their own marriages.

J says most common among those who have been married multiple times before. That's also correct because people often decide to remarry after their previous marriage.

Wait, but the question is about the correct statement. Are both C and J correct? Let me think again. The question asks for the last character of the answer. So, the correct answer letters are C and J. But in the options, each letter is a separate choice. So the question is asking which of these options is correct.

Wait, wait, the options are A to J, each with a statement. So the correct answer is either C or J. Now, I need to determine which of these is correct.

I think both C and J are correct statements, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the frequencies. C says that among those who never married before, most have remarriages. J says most common among those who have been married multiple times.

I think both are correct, but the question is asking which is the correct statement. But the options are separate, so perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Let me think about the wording. The question is about the last character of the answer. So, the correct answer will have its letter as the last character.

Wait, which of the options is a correct statement about remarriages? Let me think again.

I remember that most people have multiple partners, so they might have started a new marriage after their previous one. So J is correct because it's a common scenario.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the answer is C or J. Let me think about what the options are asking. The question is about the most common occurrence, so C says most common for those who have never been married before. J says most common for those who have been married multiple times.

I think both are correct, but the options are separate. So perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the frequency, and J seems to be a more general statement. It's saying that among people who have been married multiple times before, most are most common in remarrying. But C is saying that even among those who never married before, most are most common. That makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps J is correct because it's a common occurrence for those who have been married before. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the typical scenarios. Most people choose to remarry after their previous marriage, so J is correct. C is also correct, but perhaps the correct answer is J because it's more general.

Wait, but the options are separate. The question is, which of the options is correct. So, both C and J are correct statements, but perhaps the answer expects only one.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is J, because it's a more general statement about the most common scenario, considering those who have been married multiple times. So, the answer would be J.

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. The question is about the last character of the answer. So, the correct answer would be the letter J.

Wait, no, the correct answer is C and J are both correct statements. But the options are separate, so perhaps the answer is J, because it's a more general statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a more general statement about the frequency of remarriages regardless of the number of prior marriages.

Wait, I'm getting myself stuck. Let me try to think of it differently. The question asks, "What is the correct statement about remarriages?" So, the correct answer is J, because it's a common occurrence for people who have been married before, and C is also correct but perhaps not the most accurate.

Wait, no, both C and J seem correct. But perhaps the answer is J because it's a more general statement about the most common scenario for those who have been married multiple times before.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: look up the answer. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory.

I think that most people choose to remarry after their previous marriage, so J is correct. C is also correct because many people start their own marriages from scratch. So, if the options are separate, the correct answer would have the letter J.

Wait, but the options are separate, so the correct answer is J. So the answer is J.

The question asks about the frequency of remarriages and which statement is correct. 

Option C states that most common among those who have never been married before. Option J, on the other hand, states that this is most common among those who have been married multiple times before. Both statements are correct, but J is more general and likely the intended answer.

Answer: J
