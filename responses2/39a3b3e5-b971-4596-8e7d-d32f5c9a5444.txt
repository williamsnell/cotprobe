Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about intention tremors. I'm a bit rusty on my neurology, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about intention tremors.

I remember that intention tremors are a type of muscle weakness. They occur when a muscle, particularly in the basal muscle, stops responding to a stimulus. So, they're related to muscle weakness and can be caused by various disorders.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It's a symptom of Alzheimer's. I think Alzheimer's can affect the brain, which might include the basal ganglia, leading to a loss of strength and eventually tremors. So this seems plausible.

Option B: Worsened by alcohol. I'm not sure. Alcohol might affect the central nervous system, but I don't recall it directly causing tremors. Maybe it affects something else, like the central nervous system, but I don't think that's the main effect.

Option C: Caused by frontal lobe lesion. The frontal lobe is involved in cognitive functions, but I'm not sure how that relates to tremors. I think tremors are more related to the basal ganglia and other muscle groups, not the frontal lobe.

Option D: Caused by spinal cord damage. Spinal cord injuries can cause tremors, especially if the injury affects motor skills. But the question is about a general condition, not a specific injury.

Option E: Involuntary movement disorder. That's a bit vague. I know tremors are part of involuntary movements, so maybe this is true. But I'm not sure if it's a specific condition or a general term.

Option F: Indicative of a cerebellar lesion. The cerebellum is involved in balance and coordination. Cerebellar lesions can cause tremors, so this could be correct. But I'm not certain about the association.

Option G: Caused by Parkinson's. Parkinson's affects the basal ganglia, which are involved in tremors, so this is plausible.

Option H: Worse at rest. I'm trying to remember. I think tremors are more common when you're at rest, because the central nervous system is more relaxed. So this makes sense.

Option I: Dyscalculia is a common association. I'm not sure about this. Dyscalculia is a math learning disability, not directly related to tremors. So I don't think this is correct.

Option J: Occurs only during sleep. I don't think this is true. Tremors can occur other than during sleep, especially when the central nervous system is relaxed.

Now, going back to the original question: which of the options is true about intention tremors. Let's consider each one.

Option B: Consuming alcohol might affect brain function. Alcohol can influence the brain's ability to process information, including a loss of strength and maybe slowing down responses. But I don't think it directly worsens tremors. I'm more confident that alcohol affects the central nervous system, like Cerebral Hemisphericity, which is about the brain's balance between right and left hemispheres. So B might not be correct.

Option H: Worsened at rest. This is a common occurrence. When you're at rest, the brain is more relaxed, so it's easier to experience tremors. So H seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Option E says it's an involuntary movement disorder. tremors are involuntary movements. But the question is about which is true about the condition. So all the options are statements about the condition, so any correct ones would be true statements.

Looking back, I think the correct answer is H: It is worse at rest. That's definitely true. So the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: It is worse at rest. 

Explanation:
- **Option H** is correct because intention tremors are involuntary movements, and they are often worse at rest due to the relaxed state of the central nervous system.
- **Option E** is also true, as tremors are involuntary movements, but the question focuses on the condition's characteristics, making H the more accurate choice.
- Other options either pertain to specific causes or unrelated conditions, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, but H directly addresses the worsening at rest, which is a well-established feature of intention tremors.
