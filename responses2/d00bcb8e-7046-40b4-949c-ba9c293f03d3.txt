Okay, so I need to figure out the biggest risk factor for infection with Ebola. I remember that Ebola is a highly contagious virus, but I'm not exactly clear on the specifics. Let me think through each option.

Option A: Working in a category IV laboratory. I think category IV refers to labs that are not labile, meaning they don't have a good supply of antibodies. So, if someone is in a lab without an antibody, they might get sick easily. That makes sense because without the antibodies, they can't fight off the virus, increasing the chance of infection. But wait, is category IV specifically about poor antibody levels or just the number of tests? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B: Attending a funeral of a victim outside. I don't think there's a direct link here. Masses or funerals might cause social contact, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to the risk of getting an infection. It could be risky, but I don't recall it being the main factor.

Option C: Nursing a patient at home. This seems like a lower-risk activity. Nursing is usually low contact, and hospitals are the primary source of the virus spread. So this option probably isn't the biggest risk factor.

Option D: Attending football matches or large gatherings. Football could bring people together, but again, that's more about socializing rather than direct contact. I don't think football matches are the main point where people come into contact for an infection. The main source is hospitals, so D might not be the highest risk.

So, putting it together, the biggest risk factor would be working in a category IV laboratory because those labs are less efficient at producing antibodies. This means the person can't fight the virus as effectively, leading to a higher chance of infection.

The biggest risk factor for Ebola infection is working in a category IV laboratory, where the lack of antibody production increases the risk of infection.
