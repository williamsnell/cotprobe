Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about conversion reactions and the theories explaining a disorder. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question is asking what a conversion reaction is and what the psychoanalytic and behavioral theories say about it. The options are A to J, each with a different explanation.

First, I remember that conversion reactions are a concept in psychology, probably from psychoanalysis. From what I've read, conversion refers to a change in behavior due to internal mental struggles. It's like when an individual feels a conflict and resolves it, leading to a new behavior.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Says conversion is purely physiological and has no basis in psychology. That doesn't sound right because I think conversion is psychological.

Option B: Says it's related to innate fear. I think that's more about the instinctual aspect, not necessarily a conversion but more about the response.

Option C: Talks about physical trauma causing conversion. That doesn't make much sense. I don't think conversion reactions are caused by trauma, but more by internal conflicts.

Option D: This one seems to fit. It says conversion is impairments in musculature or sensory functions without a physical cause, rooted in unresolved complex or imitated behavior. That sounds familiar. Psychoanalytic theories explain that this is due to unresolved emotions or thoughts, and behavioral theory might say the behavior was formed without a conscious reason.

Option E: Non-experiential behavior, which doesn't seem right. Conversion is supposed to be a conscious process.

Option F: Genetic predispositions, which doesn't fit with the question about theories explaining the disorder, I think.

Option G: Developmental stages, which I don't recall being the cause of conversion reactions. That seems off.

Option H: Mental disorders without theories backing them. Hmm, conversion reactions are often seen as disorders, so their theories would be about why they occur.

Option I: Chemical imbalances, no psychological factors. Not sure about this one. I don't think it's about chemicals, but maybe something else.

Option J: Attention-seeking without conflict. Again, not sure, but I think conversion is more about behaviors resulting from thought processes rather than attention.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be D. It explains that conversion is a result of psychological conflicts, leading to impaired functions without physical causes, based on psycho and behavioral theories.

Another point: The question is about conversion reactions and theories explaining the disorder. So the theories are about why a disorder occurs, like the idea that it's due to unresolved emotions or thought processes (psycho) and maybe the behavior was formed without a conscious plan (behavioral theory).

So, looking at each option, only D fits. The others don't align well with what I remember about conversion reactions in psychology.

The correct answer is D: Conversion reactions are impairments of musculature or sensory functions without any physiological causes, rooted in unresolved Oedipus or Electra complex according to psychoanalytic theory, or imitated behavior according to behavioral theory.

**Answer: D**
