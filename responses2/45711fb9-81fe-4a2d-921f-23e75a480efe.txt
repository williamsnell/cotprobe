Okay, so I have this question about due dates for a loan, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The loan was made on December 17, and the time period is 120 days. The question is, when is it due? It's not a leap year, so February has 28 days. 

First, I need to calculate the due date 120 days after December 17. Let me think about how to count 120 days from that date.

Starting from December 17, let's add each month one by one until I reach 120 days. 

December has 31 days, but we're starting on the 17th. So from December 17 to December 31 is 14 days (including the 17th). So 31 - 17 = 14 days in December.

That leaves 120 - 14 = 106 days remaining into the next months.

Now, January has 31 days. So adding that brings us to 106 -31 =75 days left.

February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year). So subtracting 28 from 75 gives 47 days remaining.

Now, March has 31 days. Subtracting that, 47 -31 =16 days left.

So, after March, we have 16 days left. April has 30 days. So let's add 16 days to April 1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recount because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the due date is 120 days after Dec 17.

Wait, maybe a better way is to count each month one by one.

Starting from December 17:

- December: 17th to 31st. That's 15 days (including the 17th). So 31-17=14 days? Wait, no: from 17th to 31st, how many days? Let's see: 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31. That's 15 days in total (including both start and end). So actually, from Dec 17 to Dec 31 is 15 days.

So that leaves 120 -15 =105 days remaining.

January has 31 days. So 105 -31=74 days remaining.

February has 28 days, so 74-28=46 days left.

March has 31 days. Subtract that, 46-31=15 days remaining.

So after March 31, we have 15 days left. April has 30 days. So adding 15 days to April 1 (since the next day after March 31 is April 1), so April 15 would be the 15th day.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the days:

Dec 17 to Dec 31: 15 days (including both ends).

So 120-15=105.

January: 31 → 105-31=74.

February: 28 → 74-28=46.

March:31→46-31=15.

So March 31 is the last day of the 31 days. 15 days after March 31 is April 15. So the due date is April 15.

Looking at the options, option A is April 15. So the answer should be A.

The loan is due 120 days after December 17. Starting from December 17:

- December has 31 days, with the first day being December 17. So from Dec 17 to Dec 31 is 15 days.
- Subtracting these 15 days from 120 leaves 105 days remaining.
- January has 31 days, subtracting those leaves 74 days.
- February has 28 days, subtracting those leaves 46 days.
- March has 31 days, subtracting those leaves 15 days remaining.
- April 1 plus 15 days is April 15.

Thus, the due date is April 15.
