Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is asking for how many positive integer values of x ≤ 100 make 3^x − x² divisible by 5. Hmm, I remember that when something is divisible by 5, it means that when you divide it by 5, there's no remainder. So, 3^x - x² ≡ 0 mod 5. That means 3^x ≡ x² mod 5. 

I think modular arithmetic is the way to go here. Maybe I can find patterns or cycles in the powers of 3 and the squares modulo 5. Let's break it down.

First, let's look at 3^x mod 5. I know that 3 has a cycle modulo 5. Let's compute 3^x mod 5 for x from 1 upwards to see if there's a repeating pattern.

3^1 mod5 = 3
3^2 mod5 = 9 mod5 = 4
3^3 mod5 = 12 mod5 = 2
3^4 mod5 = 6 mod5 = 1
3^5 mod5 = 3 again. So it cycles every 4 steps: 3,4,2,1,3,4,2,1,...

So the cycle length for 3^x mod5 is 4. That means every 4 exponents, the pattern repeats.

Next, let's look at x² mod5. Squares modulo 5 can have a few values. Let's compute x mod5 first, then square them and see the result mod5.

x mod5: 0,1,2,3,4
x² mod5: 0,1,4,9 mod5=4, 16 mod5=1.

Wait, let me list them correctly:

If x ≡0 mod5, x² ≡0 mod5
x≡1: 1
x≡2:4
x≡3:9 mod5=4
x≡4:16 mod5=1

So, the possible squares mod5 are 0,1,4. So x² mod5 can be 0,1, or4.

Now, we need 3^x ≡ x² mod5. So let's see for each possible residue of x mod5, what happens.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of x mod5, since both 3^x and x² depend on x modulo some number.

Wait, since 3^x mod5 cycles every 4, and x² mod5 cycles every 5, maybe the period here is the least common multiple of 4 and 5, which is 20. So perhaps the pattern repeats every 20. So, maybe we can find all x from 1 to 20, and count how many satisfy 3^x ≡x² mod5, then multiply by the number of cycles up to 100.

Let me try that approach.

So let's list x from 1 to 20 and compute 3^x mod5 and x² mod5:

x | 3^x mod5 | x² mod5 | Equal?
---|---------|---------|-------
1 | 3       | 1       | No
2 |4        |4        | Yes
3 |2        |4        | No
4 |1        |1        | Yes
5 |3        |0        | No
6 |4        |1        | No
7 |2        |4        | No
8 |1        |1        | Yes
9 |3        |4        | No
10 |1       |0        | No
11 |3       |1       | No
12 |4       |4       | Yes
13 |2       |4       | No
14 |1       |1       | Yes
15 |3       |0       | No
16 |4       |1       | No
17 |2       |4       | No
18 |1       |1       | Yes
19 |3       |4       | No
20 |1       |0       | No

Wait wait, let me correct this. Let me recompute because I might have made a mistake in some calculations.

Wait, maybe I should list each x from 1 to 20:

x=1:
3^1 mod5=3; x²=1 mod5=1. 3≡1? No.

x=2:
3^2=9 mod5=4; x²=4 mod5=4. 4≡4? Yes. So count this.

x=3:
3^3=27 mod5=2; x²=9 mod5=4. 2≠4. No.

x=4:
3^4=81 mod5=1; x²=16 mod5=1. 1=1. Yes.

x=5:
3^5=243 mod5=3; x²=25 mod5=0. 3≠0. No.

x=6:
3^6=729 mod5=729/5=145*5=725, 729-725=4; x²=36 mod5=1. 4≠1. No.

x=7:
3^7=2187 mod5: 3^4=1, so 3^7=3^(4+3)=1*3^3=27 mod5=2. x²=49 mod5=49-45=4. 2≠4. No.

x=8:
3^8=3^4*3^4=1*1=1 mod5. x²=64 mod5=64-60=4. 1≠4. No.

x=9:
3^9=3^8 *3=1*3=3 mod5. x²=81 mod5=1. 3≠1. No.

x=10:
3^10=3^4^2 *3^2=1^2 *4=4 mod5. x²=100 mod5=0. 4≠0. No.

x=11:
3^11=3^10 *3=4*3=12 mod5=2. x²=121 mod5=1. 2≠1. No.

x=12:
3^12=3^10 *3^2=4*4=16 mod5=1. x²=144 mod5=144-28*5=144-140=4. 1≠4. No.

x=13:
3^13=3^12 *3=1*3=3 mod5. x²=169 mod5=169-33*5=169-165=4. 3≠4. No.

x=14:
3^14=3^13 *3=3*3=9 mod5=4. x²=196 mod5=196-39*5=196-195=1. 4≠1. No.

x=15:
3^15=3^14 *3=4*3=12 mod5=2. x²=225 mod5=0. 2≠0. No.

x=16:
3^16=3^15 *3=2*3=6 mod5=1. x²=256 mod5=256-51*5=256-255=1. 1=1. Yes. Count this.

x=17:
3^17=3^16 *3=1*3=3 mod5. x²=289 mod5=289-57*5=289-285=4. 3≠4. No.

x=18:
3^18=3^17 *3=3*3=9 mod5=4. x²=324 mod5=324-64*5=324-320=4. 4=4. Yes. Count this.

x=19:
3^19=3^18 *3=4*3=12 mod5=2. x²=361 mod5=361-72*5=361-360=1. 2≠1. No.

x=20:
3^20=3^19 *3=2*3=6 mod5=1. x²=400 mod5=0. 1≠0. No.

So in the first 20 numbers, x=2,4,12,16,18 are the ones that satisfy 3^x ≡x² mod5. That's 5 numbers. Wait, wait, let's recount:

x=2: yes

x=4: yes

x=12: yes

x=16: yes

x=18: yes

So that's 5 numbers in 20.

Wait, that's 5. So every 20 numbers, there are 5 x's that satisfy the condition. So in 100 numbers, which is 5 cycles of 20, that would be 5*5=25.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check, because sometimes when the cycle is broken, maybe the count isn't exactly 5 each time. Wait, in 20 numbers, we found 5 matches. So 100 would be 5*5=25. So option A is 25. But let me make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, let me recheck x=20. I thought x=20, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recompute x=20:

3^20 mod5: 3^4=1, so 3^20= (3^4)^5 =1^5=1 mod5.

x²=20²=400. 400 mod5 is 0. So 1≠0, so x=20 doesn't work. So the last one in 20 is x=18, which is yes. So 5 in 20 numbers.

Wait, I think I missed x=20, but in 20, it's not counted. So in 20, 5 numbers. So in 100, 50? But wait, 20*5=100, so 50 matching? But wait, when I counted from x=1 to 20, I found 5 numbers. So 5 in every 20 numbers. So 100/20=5 cycles, 5*5=25. So that's 25 numbers up to 100. So the answer would be option A:25.

But wait, let me check if my initial calculations are correct. Let me recount:

From x=1 to 20, the numbers that satisfy are:

2,4,12,16,18. That's 5. So 5 per 20, so up to 100, it's 5*5=25. So yes, option A is 25.

But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes when the modulus cycles, the count can differ. Let me make a table for x from 1 to 20, and see:

x | 3^x mod5 | x² mod5 | Equal?
---|---------|---------|-----
1 |3       |1       |No
2 |4       |4       |Yes
3 |2       |4       |No
4 |1       |1       |Yes
5 |3       |0       |No
6 |4       |1       |No
7 |2       |4       |No
8 |1       |1       |Yes
9 |3       |4       |No
10|1       |0       |No
11|3       |1       |No
12|1       |4       |No (Wait no, x=12, x²=144 mod5=144-28*5=144-140=4. So x² is 4. 3^12 mod5 is 1. 1≠4. So x=12: No.

Wait wait, earlier I thought x=12 was yes, but according to the calculation, 3^12 mod5 is 1, x² mod5 is 4. So no. So my initial table was correct.

x=13: 3^13 mod5=3. x²=169 mod5=169-33*5=169-165=4. 3≠4. No.

x=14: 3^14 mod5=4. x²=196 mod5=1. 4≠1. No.

x=15: 3^15 mod5=2. x²=225 mod5=0. 2≠0. No.

x=16: 3^16 mod5=1. x²=256 mod5=1. Yes.

x=17: 3^17 mod5=3. x²=289 mod5=4. 3≠4. No.

x=18: 3^18 mod5=4. x²=324 mod5=4. Yes.

x=19:3^19 mod5=2. x²=361 mod5=1. 2≠1. No.

x=20:3^20 mod5=1. x²=400 mod5=0. 1≠0. No.

So the correct numbers in 1-20 are x=2,4,16,18. Only 4 numbers, not 5. Wait, that's a problem. So earlier I thought there were 5, but it's actually 4. Then that would change the count.

Wait, let me recount. From x=1 to 20:

At x=2: yes.

x=4: yes.

x=16: yes.

x=18: yes.

Wait, that's four numbers. So why did I think there were 5 earlier? Because I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. So x=12: no, x=14: no, x=15: no, x=20: no. So only 2,4,16,18. So that's 4 numbers in 20.

Wait, so my initial count was wrong. So that would mean that in 20, there are 4 numbers. So then, 100 is 5 cycles of 20, so 4*5=20. But that would mean 20 numbers. But wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should check each x again. Let me go through each x from 1 to 20:

x=1: 3^1=3 mod5=3; x²=1 mod5=1 → 3≠1. No.
x=2:3^2=9 mod5=4; x²=4 mod5=4 → yes. Count 1.
x=3:3^3=27 mod5=2; x²=9 mod5=4 → 2≠4. No.
x=4:3^4=81 mod5=1; x²=16 mod5=1 → yes. Count 2.
x=5:3^5=243 mod5=3; x²=25 mod5=0 → 3≠0. No.
x=6:3^6=729 mod5=4; x²=36 mod5=1 →4≠1. No.
x=7:3^7=2187 mod5=2; x²=49 mod5=4 →2≠4. No.
x=8:3^8=6561 mod5=1; x²=64 mod5=4 →1≠4. No.
x=9:3^9=19683 mod5=3; x²=81 mod5=1 →3≠1. No.
x=10:3^10=59049 mod5=4; x²=100 mod5=0 →4≠0. No.
x=11:3^11=177147 mod5=2; x²=121 mod5=1 →2≠1. No.
x=12:3^12=531441 mod5=1; x²=144 mod5=4 →1≠4. No.
x=13:3^13=1594323 mod5=3; x²=169 mod5=4 →3≠4. No.
x=14:3^14=4782969 mod5=4; x²=196 mod5=1 →4≠1. No.
x=15:3^15=14348907 mod5=2; x²=225 mod5=0 →2≠0. No.
x=16:3^16=43046721 mod5=1; x²=256 mod5=1 →1=1. Yes. Count 3.
x=17:3^17=129140163 mod5=3; x²=289 mod5=4 →3≠4. No.
x=18:3^18=387420489 mod5=4; x²=324 mod5=4 → yes. Count 4.
x=19:3^19=1162261467 mod5=2; x²=361 mod5=1 →2≠1. No.
x=20:3^20=... mod5=1; x²=400 mod5=0 →1≠0. No.

So in 20, there are 4 numbers: x=2,4,16,18. So that's 4. So 100 would be 5*4=20. But wait, that can't be right because x=20 is not a match. So that's 4 in 20, so 4*5=20.

Wait, but that would mean 20 numbers in 100, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the 4 in 20 is correct, so 100 has 5*4=20 numbers.

Thus, the answer would be 20. So option C:20.

But wait, let me think again. The initial approach thought 5, but upon recounting, it's 4. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have a different approach. Let's model the equation 3^x ≡x² mod5.

So, for each x mod5, let's compute 3^x mod5 and x² mod5, and see if they match.

Let me consider x mod5 as 0,1,2,3,4.

For x ≡0 mod5:

x² ≡0 mod5.

3^x mod5: since 3^4=1, 3^x=3^(4k) *3^r=1^k *3^r. So if x is 0 mod5, then x=5m, so 3^x=3^(5m) mod5= (3^4)^m *3^1 mod5=1^m *3=3 mod5.

So 3^x mod5=3. 3^x ≡x² mod5 →3 ≡0 mod5? No. So x≡0 mod5 is not a solution.

For x ≡1 mod5:

x²≡1 mod5.

3^x mod5: x=5m+1 →3^x=3^(5m+1)= (3^5)^m *3^1=1^m *3=3 mod5.

So 3^x=3 mod5. x²=1 mod5. 3≡1 mod5? No.

For x≡2 mod5:

x²≡4 mod5.

3^x mod5: x=5m+2 →3^x=3^(5m+2)= (3^5)^m *3^2=1^m *9=9 mod5=4 mod5.

So 3^x=4 mod5. x²=4 mod5. 4=4 → yes. So x≡2 mod5 is a solution.

For x≡3 mod5:

x²≡9 mod5=4 mod5.

3^x mod5: 3^(5m+3)= (3^5)^m *3^3=1^m *27=27 mod5=2 mod5.

So 3^x=2 mod5. x²=4 mod5. 2≠4 → no.

For x≡4 mod5:

x²≡16 mod5=1 mod5.

3^x mod5: 3^(5m+4)= (3^5)^m *3^4=1^m *81=81 mod5=1 mod5.

So 3^x=1 mod5. x²=1 mod5. 1=1 → yes. So x≡4 mod5 is a solution.

So the solutions modulo5 are x≡2 and x≡4 mod5.

So in each block of 5 consecutive numbers, there are 2 solutions. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 100?

100 divided by5 is20. So 20 blocks, each contributing 2 solutions: 20*2=40.

Wait, but this contradicts previous counts. Hmm, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me make a table for x=2 to x=5, and see:

x |3^x mod5 |x² mod5|Equal?
---|---|---|---
2 |4 |4 |Yes
3 |2 |4 |No
4 |1 |1 |Yes
5 |3 |0 |No

So in 5 numbers, x=2,4 are solutions. So 2 solutions per 5. So 20 numbers, 40 solutions. But wait, earlier I thought 100 would have 20 solutions, which is because 20*2=40.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of cycles where the pattern repeats. So each 5 numbers, 2 solutions. So in 100 numbers, 20*5=100. So 100/5=20 blocks. Each block has 2 solutions, so 20*2=40 solutions.

But earlier I thought x=2,4,12,16,18 are solutions up to 20, which is 5, but now it's 4. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, let me check each x from 1 to 20 to see which are solutions:

x=1:3≠1 → No.
x=2:4=4 → Yes.
x=3:2≠4 → No.
x=4:1=1 → Yes.
x=5:3≠0 → No.
x=6:4≠1 → No.
x=7:2≠4 → No.
x=8:1≠1 → Yes. Wait, wait, x=8: 3^8=6561 mod5=1. x²=64 mod5=4. 1≠4 → No. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, earlier when I checked x=8, I thought 3^8 mod5=1. Let me confirm:

3^1=3 mod5=3.
3^2=9 mod5=4.
3^3=27 mod5=2.
3^4=81 mod5=1.
3^5=243 mod5=3.
3^6=729 mod5=4.
3^7=2187 mod5=2.
3^8=6561 mod5=1.

Yes, 3^8 mod5=1. x²=8²=64 mod5=4. So 1≠4 → No.

Wait, so earlier when I thought x=8 is a solution, I was wrong. So in 20 numbers, x=2,4,16,18 are the solutions.

So 4 numbers in 20. So 4*5=20 in 100.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in 20, x=2,4,12,16,18 are 5. But upon recounting, x=2,4,16,18 are 4. So which is correct?

Wait, let me check x=12.

x=12:3^x mod5=3^12. 3^4=1, so 3^12= (3^4)^3=1^3=1 mod5. x²=144 mod5=144-28*5=144-140=4. So 1≠4 → No. So x=12 is not a solution.

Wait, but earlier I thought x=12 is a solution, which was a mistake. So in 20, x=2,4,16,18 are the solutions. So that's 4 numbers.

So in 100, which is 5*20, 4*5=20. So option C:20.

But wait, let me think again. Because earlier when I thought that in 20 numbers, 4 are solutions, but perhaps I should reevaluate the count.

Wait, let's recount the 20 numbers:

x=1:3≠1 → No
x=2:4=4 → Yes
x=3:2≠4 → No
x=4:1=1 → Yes
x=5:3≠0 → No
x=6:4≠1 → No
x=7:2≠4 → No
x=8:1≠4 → No
x=9:3≠0 → No
x=10:4≠0 → No
x=11:2≠1 → No
x=12:1≠4 → No
x=13:3≠4 → No
x=14:4≠1 → No
x=15:2≠0 → No
x=16:1=1 → Yes
x=17:3≠4 → No
x=18:4=4 → Yes
x=19:2≠0 → No
x=20:1≠0 → No

So in 20, only x=2,4,16,18 are solutions. So 4 in 20. So 100 is 5*20=100, so 4*5=20.

So the correct answer is 20, which is option C.
</think>

The problem requires finding the number of positive integers \( x \leq 100 \) such that \( 3^x - x^2 \) is divisible by 5. This translates to finding \( x \) where \( 3^x \equiv x^2 \pmod{5} \).

### Step 1: Analyze \( 3^x \mod 5 \)

The powers of 3 modulo 5 cycle every 4 exponents:
- \( 3^1 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 3^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 3^3 \equiv 27 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 3^4 \equiv 81 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 3^5 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) (cycle repeats)

### Step 2: Analyze \( x^2 \mod 5 \)

Squares of integers modulo 5 can only be 0, 1, or 4:
- \( 0^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 3^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 4^2 \equiv 16 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
- \( 5^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) (cycle repeats)

### Step 3: Find \( x \) such that \( 3^x \equiv x^2 \pmod{5} \)

By examining each residue class modulo 5, we find the valid \( x \) values:

- **\( x \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \):** \( 3^x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), \( x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) → No match.
- **\( x \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \):** \( 3^x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), \( x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) → No match.
- **\( x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \):** \( 3^x \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), \( x^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \) → Match.
- **\( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \):** \( 3^x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), \( x^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \) → No match.
- **\( x \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \):** \( 3^x \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), \( x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \) → Match.

Thus, the valid residues modulo 5 are \( x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) and \( x \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).

### Step 4: Count valid \( x \) values up to 100

Each block of 5 consecutive numbers contributes 2 valid \( x \) values. For 100 numbers:

- Number of blocks: \( 100 / 5 = 20 \).
- Valid \( x \) per block: 2.
- Total valid \( x \): \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \).

### Final Answer

The number of positive integers \( x \leq 100 \) such that \( 3^x - x^2 \) is divisible by 5 is **40**.

Answer: C
