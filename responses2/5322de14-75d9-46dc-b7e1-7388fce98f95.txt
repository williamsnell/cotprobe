Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about vapor pressures and solutions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that the vapor pressures of pure benzene and toluene at 60°C are 385 and 139 Torr, respectively. I remember that Raoult's Law applies here because the solution is homogeneous. Raoult's Law says that the partial vapor pressure of each component is equal to its mole fraction in the solution multiplied by its pure vapor pressure.

The questions are (a) partial pressures, (b) total vapor pressure, and (c) mole fraction of toluene in the vapor. Let's tackle each part step by step.

First, part (a): I need to find the partial pressures of benzene and toluene. So, I think I need their mole fractions in the solution.

Wait, but I don't have the mole fractions yet. Oh, wait, the solution has a mole fraction of toluene, X_toluene, which is given in part (c) as 0.355 for option I, but wait, no, each option gives different X_toluene. Wait, actually, the question says, for each option, (a) gives their partial pressures, (b) the total, and (c) the X_toluene in the vapor. Wait, no, the question is to calculate (a), (b), and (c) for each option, but looking at the options, each option lists P_benzene, P_toluene, P_total, and X_toluene in the vapor. But the way the question is written, perhaps each option is a possible answer, with each part (a) to (c) calculated, but the options are each a set of four values.

Wait, actually, the question is asking for the correct values of (a) the partial pressures, (b) total vapor pressure, and (c) mole fraction in the vapor of toluene. But each option lists three values for each case, but the solution seems to have varying mole fractions in the vapor. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is to compute these for a solution that has a given mole fraction of toluene, and then see which option matches. But the question isn't giving a specific mole fraction; it's asking for the values for a solution that has a certain X_toluene. Let me re-read the question.

The question says, "calculate (a) the partial pressures of benzene and toluene, (b) the total vapor pressure of the solution, and (c) the mole fraction of toluene in the vapor above a solution with 0.60 mole fraction toluene." Wait, so (a) and (b) are about the solution's components, and (c) is about the vapor solution.

So, the solution is 0.60 mole fraction toluene. So, X_toluene = 0.6, so X_benzene = 0.4.

Wait, but I don't have the solution's mole fractions yet. Oh, wait, no. Because in part (a) and (b), I have to calculate the partial pressures and total vapor pressure based on the solution's mole fractions. Then, in part (c), I have to find the mole fraction of toluene in the vapor.

Wait, but the given data is the pure vapor pressures of benzene and toluene. So, assuming ideal solution behavior, I can apply Raoult's Law.

Let me structure the steps.

1. Find the mole fractions in the solution: X_benzene and X_toluene. In this case, the solution is 0.60 mole fraction toluene, so X_toluene = 0.6.

2. Then, using Raoult's Law, compute the partial pressures:

P_benzene = X_benzene * P^0_benzene.

P_toluene = X_toluene * P^0_toluene.

3. The total vapor pressure is P_total = P_benzene + P_toluene.

4. Then, for part (c), find the mole fraction of toluene in the vapor, X_toluene_vap.

I remember that X_toluene_vap is (P_toluene) / (P_total).

So, steps are clear.

Let me compute each step.

First, the solution's mole fractions:

X_toluene = 0.6.

X_benzene = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.

Now, calculate partial pressures.

P_benzene = 0.4 * 385 = ?

0.4 * 385 = 154 Torr.

P_toluene = 0.6 * 139 = ?

0.6 * 139 = 83.4 Torr.

So, P_benzene is 154 Torr, P_toluene is 83.4 Torr.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I has P_benzene=154.0, P_toluene=83.4. But part (c) uses these to find the vapor mole fraction.

Wait, let me compute part (c) using these values.

So, X_toluene_vap = P_toluene / P_total.

P_total = 154 + 83.4 = 237.4 Torr.

So, X_toluene = 83.4 / 237.4 ≈ 0.351.

Looking at the options, option I's X_toluene is 0.351. So, the correct values would be:

(a) P_benzene=154.0, P_toluene=83.4.

(b) P_total=237.4.

(c) X_toluene=0.351.

So, which option has these? Let's check the options:

Looking at the options, option I says:

P_benzene=154.0, P_toluene=83.4, P_total=237.4, X_toluene=0.351. That matches.

So the correct answer would be option I, which is I: 154.0, 83.4, 237.4, 0.351.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Wait, X_toluene is 0.6, so benzene is 0.4. P_benzene = 0.4 *385=154, P_toluene=0.6 * 139=83.4. P_total 154+83.4=237.4. X_toluene in vapor is 83.4/237.4 ≈ 0.351, which is option I.

So, the correct answer is option I.

To solve the problem, we use Raoult's Law and the given data:

1. **Pure vapor pressures**:  
   - Benzene: \( P^0_{\text{benzene}} = 385 \, \text{Torr} \)  
   - Toluene: \( P^0_{\text{toluene}} = 139 \, \text{Torr} \)  

2. **Solution composition**:  
   - The solution has a mole fraction of toluene, \( X_{\text{toluene}} = 0.60 \).  
   - Therefore, the mole fraction of benzene is \( X_{\text{benzene}} = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 \).

3. **Partial pressures**:  
   Using Raoult's Law:  
   - \( P_{\text{benzene}} = X_{\text{benzene}} \cdot P^0_{\text{benzene}} = 0.40 \cdot 385 = 154 \, \text{Torr} \)  
   - \( P_{\text{toluene}} = X_{\text{toluene}} \cdot P^0_{\text{toluene}} = 0.60 \cdot 139 = 83.4 \, \text{Torr} \)  

4. **Total vapor pressure**:  
   \( P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{benzene}} + P_{\text{toluene}} = 154 + 83.4 = 237.4 \, \text{Torr} \).

5. **Mole fraction of toluene in the vapor**:  
   Using the formula \( X_{\text{toluene, vapor}} = \frac{P_{\text{toluene}}}{P_{\text{total}}} = \frac{83.4}{237.4} \approx 0.351 \).

Now, we compare the calculated values with the options provided:

- **Option I**:  
  - \( P_{\text{benzene}} = 154.0 \, \text{Torr} \)  
  - \( P_{\text{toluene}} = 83.4 \, \text{Torr} \)  
  - \( P_{\text{total}} = 237.4 \, \text{Torr} \)  
  - \( X_{\text{toluene, vapor}} = 0.351 \)  

These values match exactly with the calculations. 

**Conclusion**:  
The correct answer is **Option I**.
