Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about difference feminism. Hmm, I remember that difference feminism is a social theory, right? It's all about recognizing and valuing the differences between genders. But wait, the question is about the central thesis. So I need to think about what the main point is.

Let me look at the options again. Option A says difference feminism argues that men and women are fundamentally the same. That doesn't sound right. They are clearly different. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B says men can't understand their differences from women. I don't think that's the thesis. The thesis is more about the recognition of differences, not the belief that they are ununderstandable.

Option C claims men and women differ only in physical attributes. That's only part of the story. The thesis should mention that women also differ in their thought processes or other aspects like social roles.

Option D talks about men tending to focus on justice and women on fairness. That's more about the female's role, not the thesis. The thesis is about the recognition of differences, not about their roles.

Option E says women are more focused on equality than men. Again, that's a different issue. The thesis isn't about which gender is more focused on equality; it's about the recognition of differences.

Option F: Women focus on equality, men on fairness. Similar to D, this is about the gender's role in justice, not the thesis.

Option G: Feminism is about eradicating differences. Oh wait, isn't that exactly the central thesis? Because feminist theory aims to eliminate gender-related issues. So this sounds like G.

Option H: Men and women have different conceptions of the feminist project. That's about views on what the feminist movement is, not the thesis.

Option I: Women and men agree on justice. No, the thesis is about recognizing differences, not the approach to justice.

Option J: Women look to context, men to abstract notions. That's about the approach to justice, not the thesis.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is G because it directly states that feminism aims to eliminate gender differences.

The correct answer is G: 'Feminism is about eradicating differences between men and women.' This directly addresses the central thesis of difference feminism, which emphasizes recognizing and valuing gender differences.
