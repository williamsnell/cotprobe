Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating Baxter Co's inventory turnover for the year. Hmm, I remember that inventory turnover measures how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory during a period. The formula for that is:

Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory

Wait, right, because you divide the cost of goods sold by the average inventory to find out how many times the inventory was sold and replaced on average.

Looking at the data provided: 

- Beginning inventory is $20,000.
- Ending inventory is $30,000.
- Cost of goods sold (COGS) is $50,000.

But wait, I think the average inventory isn't just the beginning and ending average. Oh wait, no, the correct approach is to calculate the average inventory correctly. The average inventory is the average of the beginning and ending inventory.

So, average inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2.

Plugging in the numbers: (20,000 + 30,000)/2 = 50,000 / 2 = 25,000.

Now, using the COGS of $50,000.

So, inventory turnover = 50,000 / 25,000 = 2.

Wait, that gives a turnover of 2. Looking at the options, the answer is option I, which is 2.

The correct calculation for Baxter Co's inventory turnover is:

1. **Average Inventory**: (20,000 + 30,000) / 2 = $25,000.
2. **Inventory Turnover**: 50,000 / 25,000 = **2**.

Thus, the correct answer is **I: 2**.
