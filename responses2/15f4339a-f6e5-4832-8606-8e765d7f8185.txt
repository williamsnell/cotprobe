Okay, so I've got this question about the half-life of a proton and how many decays happen in a certain amount of water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. But wait, protons aren't really stable, right? They're part of the nucleus and can decay via beta emission. Oh wait, but protons are not stable because they're part of atomic nuclei. So, protons decay, and this decay is a process called alpha decay, isn't it? Wait no, wait. Wait, protons are part of the nucleus, so their decay would be beta minus decay, but wait, protons are actually the positively charged particles in the nucleus, so they don't decay by themselves. Wait, no, protons can't decay because they're part of the nucleus. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up with something else. Oh, wait, maybe I'm confusing with the decay of other particles like neutrons. Oh right, protons are part of the nucleus, and they can decay. So, for example, in the case of tritium (3H), the proton (which is part of a helium nucleus) undergoes beta decay. So, the decay of a proton would change into a neutron, emitting an electron. So, the process is a beta-minus decay, and the parent is a proton.

But wait, wait, wait. The question is about the half-life of a proton. If protons are not stable, their half-life would be theoretically infinite, because they don't decay. But this question says the half-life is 1e33 years, which is super long. So, the given data is that the half-life is 10^33 years. But because protons don't actually decay, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the question is referring to the decay of a nucleus, like a hydrogen atom. Wait, hydrogen has a proton and a neutron. The proton in a hydrogen atom is a part of the nucleus. So, a hydrogen atom undergoes beta decay to become helium-3. So, the process is the proton decaying into a neutron and an electron. But wait, wait. The proton itself can't decay on its own. So, the decay of a hydrogen atom involves a proton emitting a positron or something? No, wait, beta decay in the context of a nucleus where a proton converts into a neutron. So, the decay would be p → n + e⁻ + ν̄. So, the proton turns into a neutron. But wait, no, normally the decay would be p → n + e⁻ + neutrino, but perhaps the proton in the nucleus decays. So, the parent is a proton, the daughter is a neutron.

But wait, the question is about the half-life of the proton itself. Since protons are part of the nucleus, and they don't decay (since they're uncharged and stable?), perhaps the question is a bit of a trick. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the decay of a nucleus, which includes protons, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

But maybe I should proceed. Let's think about it another way. The question is about a water tank containing 350,000 liters of water. So, we're considering a certain amount of protons in the water. Each year, a certain number of these protons will decay. So, the total number of protons in the tank multiplied by the decay constant per year would give the number of decays per year.

Wait, but wait, protons are part of the nucleus, so if they decay, they would change. But if they're stable, the half-life is infinite, but in this question, the half-life is given as 1e33 years, which is a finite number. So, perhaps the question is considering a proton that has a half-life in this context, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about a different particle's decay.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the decay of a single proton into a neutron, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the decay of a nucleus, like a helium-3 nucleus, which has two protons. But wait, I'm not making much progress on that front.

Let me try to approach the problem step by step.

First, the problem says the half-life of the proton is 1e33 years. That seems incredibly long. Since protons are part of a nucleus that's stable, their half-life should be extremely long. So, the number of protons decaying in a given time would probably be negligible. But the question gives that the half-life is 1e33, and we're to calculate the number of decays per year in a 350,000 liter tank.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the decay of a specific particle, maybe a proton in a certain context. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the decay of a helium nucleus, like in a beta decay process. Let's think: if a helium-3 nucleus (which has 2 protons) undergoes beta decay, it would produce a proton and a neutron. But wait, that's about the nucleus, not the individual protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the decay of a proton in a very specific context, like in a very stable environment, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually about the decay of a single proton. But protons are part of the nucleus, which is stable, so their individual half-life would be infinite. But I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try another approach. Perhaps the question is about the decay of a single proton in the water. But since protons are part of the nucleus, perhaps the decay constant is for the nucleus, not the individual proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the decay of a single proton in a scenario where the half-life is given. But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to model it.

The number of decays per year (λ) is given by the decay constant, which is ln(2) divided by the half-life. So, first, I need to calculate the decay constant λ.

Given the half-life T_1/2 = 1e33 years.

So, λ = ln(2)/T_1/2.

Wait, but ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So, λ ≈ 0.693 / (1e33) per year.

But wait, wait. The half-life is given as 1e33 years, so I need to compute this correctly.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think I'm getting the formula right, but perhaps the question is about the decay of a specific atom's half-life, like a 238U (lead-238) atom, which has a half-life of about 4.5e9 years. But in this case, the half-life is 1e33 years, which is way longer than the known half-lives of common elements. So, the number of atoms that decay would be practically zero.

But wait, the question says the half-life is 1e33 years, which is a very long time. So, in 350,000 liters of water, how many protons decay each year? If the half-life is extremely long, the number of protons that decay in a year would be nearly zero.

But wait, let's think again. The problem is about the number of decays per year in the tank. So, perhaps it's about the decay of a specific process, like the decay of a nucleus that includes protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a specific particle, like the decay of a single proton in a scenario where it's part of a process.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the fact that the given half-life of the proton is 1e33 years, which is far too long for real-world protons. So, in a tank of 350,000 liters, the number of protons would be negligible because each proton has a half-life of 1e33 years.

Wait, but then the number of protons in the water is the number of moles times Avogadro's number. So, but to calculate that, I'd need the density of water, molar mass, and the volume.

But wait, perhaps this is a trick question. Since the protons' half-life is so long, the number of protons that decay each year is almost zero. So, the expected number of decays per year would be close to zero.

Wait, let's compute it.

Wait, but wait. Protons in water can undergo decay via beta emission. But if the half-life is 1e33 years, the number of protons that decay each year is λ * N, where N is the number of protons.

So, first, let's find N, the number of protons in 350,000 liters of water.

But wait, the number of protons is equal to the number of moles times Avogadro's number times the number of protons per molecule.

But wait, the density of water is 1 g/cm³. The molar mass of water is about 18 g/mol.

So, volume = 350,000 liters = 350,000,000 cm³.

Density is 1 g/cm³, so mass = 350,000,000 g.

Molar mass M = 18 g/mol, so moles = 350,000,000 g / 18 g/mol = approx 19,444,444.44 mol.

Each molecule of water has 2 protons, so N = 2 * 19,444,444.44 mol = 38,888,888.88 mol.

Wait, but wait, each molecule of water has 2 protons, but each proton is part of a larger structure in the nucleus. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should just proceed.

Now, the number of protons N = 38,888,888.88 mol * (6.022e23 protons/mol) = 38,888,888.88 * 6.022e23.

But that's a huge number. Let me compute that:

38,888,888.88 * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.34e33 protons.

Wait, but then the decay constant λ is ln(2)/(1e33) per year.

So, λ ≈ 0.693 / 1e33 ≈ 6.93e-34 per year.

Then, the number of decays per year is λ*N:

6.93e-34 * 2.34e33 ≈ 6.93e-34 * 2.34e33 ≈ (6.93 * 2.34) e-1 ≈ 16.25e-1 = 1.625.

Wait, that's about 1.625 decays per year. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.0, option B: 0.015, etc. But 1.6 is way higher than any of the options. So, my approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the math. Calculating N: 350,000 liters. 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 350,000 * 1000 = 350,000,000 cm³.

Density is 1 g/cm³, so mass is 350,000,000 grams.

Molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so moles = 350,000,000 / 18 ≈ 19,444,444.444 mol.

Each molecule has 2 protons, so N = 19,444,444.444 * 2 = approx 3.8888888888e8 mol.

Wait, no, wait. That's correct. But wait, 3.8888888888e8 is 3.8888888888e8 protons per mole. So, moles is 19,444,444.444, so N = 19,444,444.444 * 2 * (6.022e23) protons.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 per mole. So, N = 19,444,444.444 mol * 2 protons/mol * 6.022e23 protons/molecule.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because each water molecule has 2 protons, and each mole has Avogadro's number of molecules. So, N = (molar mass / g/mol) * number of protons per molecule * Avogadro's number.

Wait, no. Let's get this right. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so 1 mole of water is 18 grams. Each mole has 2 moles of H and 1 mole of O, so 2*1 (H is 1 g/mol) + 16 (O is 16) = 18.

So, 1 mole of H2O has 2 * 1 = 2 moles of H, which is 2 * (6.022e23) = 1.2044e24 protons.

Wait, no, each H2O molecule has 2 H atoms. So, each mole of H2O has 2 moles of H, which is 2 * 6.022e23 = 1.2044e24 H atoms.

So, for 19,444,444.444 moles of H2O, the number of H atoms is 19,444,444.444 * 1.2044e24 = ?

Let me compute that:

19,444,444.444 * 1.2044e24 = ?

But 19,444,444 is approximately 1.9444444e7.

So, 1.9444444e7 * 1.2044e24 = 1.9444444e7 * 1.2044e24 = 2.3416e31.

Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Wait, 1.9444444e7 * 1.2044e24 = 1.9444444e7 * 1.2044e24 = ?

Multiply 1.9444444e7 * 1.2044e24 = (1.9444444 * 1.2044) * 1e31.

1.9444444 * 1.2044 ≈ 2.3416.

So, around 2.3416e31 H atoms.

But wait, each H atom has a charge of +1. So, the number of protons is 2.3416e31.

So, N ≈ 2.3416e31 protons.

Wait, but wait, the half-life is 1e33 years. So, λ = ln(2) / (1e33) ≈ 0.693 / 1e33 ≈ 6.93e-34 per year.

So, the number of decays per year would be λ * N = 6.93e-34 * 2.3416e31 = ?

Multiply 6.93e-34 * 2.3416e31 = 6.93 * 2.3416 * 1e-34+31 = 6.93 * 2.3416 * 1e-3.

6.93 * 2.3416 ≈ let's compute that. 6 * 2.3416 is 14.0496, 0.93 * 2.3416 ≈ 2.18. Sum is 16.2286.

So, 16.2286 * 1e-3 = 0.0162286.

So, approximately 0.0162 decays per year.

But looking at the options, option B is 0.015. So, that would be the likely correct answer.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, the number of protons is 2.34e31. The decay constant λ is 6.93e-34 per year.

So, λ * N = (6.93e-34) * (2.3416e31) = 6.93 * 2.3416 * 1e-3.

6.93 * 2.3416 ≈ 16.25.

16.25 * 1e-3 = 0.01625.

So, approx 0.016 decays per year.

The options don't include 0.016, but option B is 0.015, which is very close. So, would that be the correct answer? Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of protons in the tank is the number of moles in the water, multiplied by Avogadro's number, but each molecule has 2 protons. So, for 350,000 liters, 350,000,000 cm³, density 1 g/cm³, mass is 350,000,000 grams, which is 350,000,000 / 18 g/mol = 19,444,444.44 mol.

Each mole has 2 moles of H, which is 2 * 6.022e23 = 1.2044e24 H atoms.

So, N = 19,444,444.44 * 1.2044e24 = let me compute that:

19,444,444.44 * 1.2044e24 = 19,444,444.44 * 1.2044 * 1e24.

Wait, 19,444,444.44 * 1.2044 = approximately 23,416,666.66.

Wait, 19,444,444.44 * 1.2 = 23,333,333.328, so 1.2044 would be a bit higher.

But to get an approximate value, it's about 23,416,666.66.

So, N ≈ 23,416,666.66 * 1e24 = 2.341666666e31 protons.

Wait, so N is about 2.34e31 protons.

Then, the decay rate λ is 0.693 / 1e33 = 6.93e-34 per year.

So, λ * N = 6.93e-34 * 2.34e31 = (6.93 * 2.34) * 1e-3.

6.93 * 2.34 = let's compute.

6 * 2 = 12, 6 * 0.34 = 2.04, 0.93 * 2 = 1.86, 0.93 * 0.34 ≈ 0.3162.

So, 12 + 2.04 + 1.86 + 0.3162 ≈ 16.2162.

So, 16.2162 * 1e-3 = 0.0162162 decays per year.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 0.015. So, the correct answer would be option B.

But wait, wait a second. I thought the number of protons would be roughly 2.3e31, which is correct. But the half-life is 1e33, which is a much larger number. So, the number of protons that decay per year is about 0.016, which is 0.015 when rounded.

But looking at the options, option B is 0.015, so that would be the answer.

Wait, but the options also include option A: 1.0, option C: 0.03, etc.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Avogadro's number. Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the number of moles of water, then multiply by Avogadro's number, then by the number of protons per molecule.

So, 350,000 liters = 350,000,000 cm³.

Density is 1 g/cm³, so mass is 350,000,000 grams.

Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol, so moles = 350,000,000 / 18 = approx 19,444,444.44 mol.

Each mole has 2 moles of H, which is 2 * 6.022e23 = 1.2044e24 H atoms.

So, N = 19,444,444.44 * (2 * 6.022e23) = 19,444,444.44 * 1.2044e24.

Wait, 19,444,444.44 * 1.2044e24 = 19,444,444.44 * 1.2044 * 1e24.

But 19,444,444.44 * 1.2044 ≈ 23,416,666.66.

So, 23,416,666.66 * 1e24 = 2.341666666e31 H atoms.

So, N = 2.341666666e31 protons.

Now, the decay constant λ = ln(2) / T1/2 = 0.6931 / 1e33 ≈ 6.931e-34 per year.

So, the number of decays per year is λ * N = 6.931e-34 * 2.341666666e31.

Let's compute that:

6.931e-34 * 2.341666666e31 = (6.931 * 2.341666666) * 1e(-34 +31) = (approx 16.25) * 1e-3 = 0.01625.

So, about 0.01625 decays per year, which is approximately 0.016.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 0.015.

So, the correct answer should be option B, 0.015.

Wait, but wait a moment. I'm getting a number around 0.016, which is 0.016, but the options don't have that. The closest is 0.015. So, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of protons.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the number of moles of H2O, multiply by Avogadro's number, and then multiply by 2 (since each H2O has 2 H), giving the number of protons.

Wait, 350,000 liters = 350,000,000 cm³.

Density is 1 g/cm³, so mass is 350,000,000 grams.

Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol, so moles = 350,000,000 / 18 = 19,444,444.44 mol.

Each mole has 2 moles of H, so H atoms = 2 * 19,444,444.44 = 38,888,888.88 mol.

Each mole of H has 6.022e23 H atoms, so H atoms = 38,888,888.88 * 6.022e23 = 2.34e31 H atoms.

So, N = 2.34e31 protons.

Then, λ = ln(2)/ (1e33) = 6.93e-34 per year.

Number of decays per year is λ*N = 6.93e-34 * 2.34e31 = (6.93 * 2.34) * 1e-3.

6.93 * 2.34 = let's compute:

6 * 2 = 12,

6 * 0.34 = 2.04,

0.93 * 2 = 1.86,

0.93 * 0.34 ≈ 0.3162.

Adding them all up: 12 + 2.04 + 1.86 + 0.3162 ≈ 16.2162.

So, 16.2162 * 1e-3 = 0.0162162.

So, approximately 0.0162 decays per year.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 0.015.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the number of protons is not 2.34e31, but perhaps a different number.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the number of protons is (350,000,000 g) / (18 g/mol) * 2.

Wait, 350,000,000 / 18 = 19,444,444.44 mol.

Multiply by 2 for H: 38,888,888.88 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 38,888,888.88 * 6.022e23 = ?

38,888,888.88 = 3.8888888888e8.

Multiply 3.8888888888e8 * 6.022e23 = 3.8888888888 * 6.022 * 1e31.

3.8888888888 * 6.022 ≈ 23.41666666.

So, 23.41666666 * 1e31 = 2.341666666e32 H atoms.

Wait, wait. Wait, that's a mistake. Because each molecule of H2O has 2 H atoms, the number of H atoms is twice the number of H2O molecules.

Wait, number of H2O molecules = 3.8888888888e8.

So, H atoms = 2 * 3.8888888888e8 = 7.7777777776e8.

Ah, I see. So, I made a mistake earlier. So, N is 7.7777777776e8 protons.

So, N = 7.7777777776e8 protons.

Then, λ = 6.93e-34 per year.

Number of decays per year is λ * N = 6.93e-34 * 7.7777777776e8.

Compute 6.93 * 7.7777777776 = ?

Well, 7 * 7.7777777777 is approximately 54.33333333.

But let me compute 7.7777777776 * 7 = 54.4444444432.

Wait, but 6.93 * 7.7777777776 is:

6 * 7 = 42,

6 * 0.77777777776 = 4.66666666656,

0.93 * 7 = 6.51,

0.93 * 0.7777777776 ≈ 0.7244.

Adding all up: 42 + 4.66666666656 + 6.51 + 0.7244 ≈ 54.50106666656.

So, approximately 54.501.

So, 54.501 * 1e( -34 +8 ) = 54.501e-26 = 5.4501e-25.

Wait, but that's way smaller than the previous result. So, this approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of N.

Wait, another approach: the number of moles of H2O is 350,000,000 / 18 = 19,444,444.44 mol.

Each mole has 2 moles of H, so moles of H = 2 * 19,444,444.44 = 38,888,888.88 mol.

Each mole of H has 6.022e23 H atoms, so N = 38,888,888.88 * 6.022e23 = approx 2.34e32 H atoms.

So, N = 2.34e32.

Then, λ = 6.93e-34 per year.

So, number of decays per year = 6.93e-34 * 2.34e32 = (6.93 * 2.34) * 1e-2.

6.93 * 2.34 = 16.2162.

16.2162 * 1e-2 = 0.162162.

Wait, so 0.162 decays per year.

But that's 0.162, which is 0.162, which is not even close to the options. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered N = 2.34e31, the result was 0.0162. But when considering N = 2.34e32, the result is 0.162.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of N.

Let me re-calculate N.

350,000,000 grams is the mass.

Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol.

So, moles of H2O = 350,000,000 / 18 = 19,444,444.44 mol.

Each H2O molecule has 2 H atoms.

So, moles of H = 19,444,444.44 * 2 = 38,888,888.88 mol.

Each mole of H has 6.022e23 H atoms.

So, N = 38,888,888.88 * 6.022e23 = 2.34e32 H atoms.

Wait, so N = 2.34e32.

Then, λ = 6.93e-34 per year.

Number of decays per year = 6.93e-34 * 2.34e32 = (6.93 * 2.34) * 1e-2.

Which is 16.2162 * 1e-2 = 0.162162 decays per year.

Which is 0.162, not 0.016.

So, this approach gives a different result, but I'm clearly making a mistake in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I should correct this and realize that the initial approach was correct, and the other approach is wrong.

So, the correct approach is to calculate the number of protons as 2.34e31, which gives a decay rate of 0.0162 per year, which rounds to 0.016.

Thus, the correct answer is option B: 0.015.

The problem involves calculating the number of protons in a given volume of water and determining the number of decays per year due to beta decay. Here's the detailed solution:

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of protons in the water

1. **Volume of water**: The water contains **350,000 liters**. Converting to cubic meters:  
   \( 350,000 \, \text{liters} = 350,000 \, \text{dm}^3 = 350,000 \, \text{cm}^3 \).

2. **Density of water**: \( 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \).  
   Mass of water:  
   \( \text{Mass} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume} = 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 350,000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 350,000 \, \text{g} \).

3. **Molar mass of water (H₂O)**: \( 18 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   Moles of water:  
   \( \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{350,000 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 19,444.44 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Number of protons**: Each molecule of water contains **2 protons**.  
   Total protons:  
   \( \text{Protons} = 2 \times 19,444.44 \, \text{mol} \approx 38,888.88 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Number of protons**:  
   \( \text{Protons} = 38,888.88 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{protons/mol} \approx 2.34 \times 10^{32} \, \text{protons} \).

---

### Step 2: Calculate the decay constant

1. **Half-life**: \( T_{1/2} = 1 \times 10^{33} \, \text{years} \).  
   The decay constant is:  
   \( \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} = \frac{0.693}{1 \times 10^{33}} = 6.93 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{per year} \).

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of decays per year

1. **Number of decays per year**:  
   \( \text{Decays per year} = \lambda \times \text{Number of protons} \).  
   \( \text{Decays per year} = 6.93 \times 10^{-34} \times 2.34 \times 10^{32} \).

2. **Compute the product**:  
   \( 6.93 \times 2.34 = 16.2162 \),  
   \( 10^{-34} \times 10^{32} = 10^{-2} \).  
   \( \text{Decays per year} = 16.2162 \times 10^{-2} = 0.162162 \).

---

### Step 4: Round to the nearest option

The calculated number of decays per year is **0.162**. However, looking at the options provided:

- **Option B: 0.015**
- **Option A: 1.0**

The closest option to **0.162** is **0.015**, but this seems inconsistent. Upon re-evaluating the calculations, it appears there was an error in the initial approach. Correcting the calculation:

1. **Correct calculation of number of protons**:  
   \( 350,000 \, \text{liters} = 350,000 \, \text{dm}^3 = 350,000 \, \text{cm}^3 \).  
   Moles of water:  
   \( \frac{350,000 \, \text{cm}^3}{18 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol}} \approx 19,444.44 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Number of protons:  
   \( 19,444.44 \, \text{mol} \times 2 \, \text{protons/mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{protons/mol} \approx 2.34 \times 10^{31} \, \text{protons} \).

2. **Correct decay calculation**:  
   \( \text{Decays per year} = 6.93 \times 10^{-34} \times 2.34 \times 10^{31} \).  
   \( 6.93 \times 2.34 = 16.2162 \),  
   \( 10^{-34} \times 10^{31} = 10^{-3} \).  
   \( \text{Decays per year} = 16.2162 \times 10^{-3} = 0.0162162 \).

### Step 5: Final Answer

The closest option to **0.016** is **0.015**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: B**
