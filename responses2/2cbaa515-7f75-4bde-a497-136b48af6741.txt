Okay, so I've got this problem here about an ideal gas and I need to find the number of moles. Alright, let's see. I remember from my chemistry class that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Right, P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

The question gives me some values. The pressure is 380 torr. Wait, I think the gas constant R is given as 0.082 L·atm·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹. Oh, right, the R value is usually in those units. But wait, the pressure is in torr, not atm. I remember that 1 atm is 760 torr. So maybe I need to convert the pressure from torr to atm to use in the equation.

The volume is 492 cm³. Oh wait, I need to convert that to liters because R is in L·atm units. So 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 492 cm³ is 0.492 liters. Got it.

The temperature is 27°C. Oh, right, I need to convert that to Kelvin. So 27°C is 300 K because you add 273.15 to convert to Kelvin. Okay, so T is 300 K.

Now, plugging into the equation: PV = nRT. Let's rearrange for n: n = PV/(RT).

First, calculate PV. P is 380 torr, V is 0.492 L. But wait, I should convert P to atm. Since 1 atm = 760 torr, 380 torr is 380/760 atm. Let me calculate that. 380 divided by 760 is 0.5 atm. Oh, so P is 0.5 atm.

So PV is 0.5 atm * 0.492 L = 0.246 L·atm.

Now, R is 0.082 L·atm·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹, and T is 300 K. So RT is 0.082 * 300 = 24.6 L·atm·mol⁻¹.

So n = PV/(RT) = 0.246 / 24.6.

Let me do that division. 0.246 divided by 24.6. Hmm, 24.6 is 24.6, and 0.246 is 2.46e-1, 24.6 is 2.46e1. So 2.46e-1 / 2.46e1 = (2.46/2.46) * (1e-2) )= 1 * 0.01 = 0.01 moles. 

Wait, that's 0.01. So looking at the options, I see option F is 0.0350, G is 0.0100, etc. So option G is 0.0100. So the answer is G.

To determine the number of moles of gas, the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \) is used, where \( n \) is the number of moles. The given values are:

- Pressure \( P = 380 \, \text{torr} \), which converts to \( 0.5 \, \text{atm} \) (\( 380 \, \text{torr} / 760 \, \text{torr/atm} \)).
- Volume \( V = 492 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.492 \, \text{L} \).
- Temperature \( T = 27^\circ \text{C} = 300 \, \text{K} \) (\( 27 + 273.15 \)).
- Gas constant \( R = 0.082 \, \text{L·atm·mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1} \).

First, calculate \( PV \):
\[
PV = (0.5 \, \text{atm})(0.492 \, \text{L}) = 0.246 \, \text{L·atm}.
\]

Next, calculate \( RT \):
\[
RT = (0.082)(300) = 24.6 \, \text{L·atm·mol}^{-1}.
\]

Finally, solve for \( n \):
\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{0.246}{24.6} = 0.01 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.0100 \, \text{moles} \), which corresponds to option G.
