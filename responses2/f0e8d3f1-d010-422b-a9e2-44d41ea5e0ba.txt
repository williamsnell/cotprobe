Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about simple harmonic motion with a mass-spring system. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question says there's an 8-gram mass attached to a spring. The spring requires 1000 dynes to extend it by 5 cm. I need to find the period of the simple harmonic motion. The options are A to J, with various seconds.

Hmm, I remember that the period of a mass-spring system is given by the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Oh wait, but the problem gives me a force and displacement, not the spring constant directly. So I think I should find k first.

Right, Hooke's Law is F = kx. Oh wait, the force applied is 1000 dynes, and the extension x is 5 cm. But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me confirm: 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 5 cm is 0.05 meters. Also, the force is in dynes. I remember that 1 dyne is approximately 1e-5 newtons. So 1000 dynes is 1000e-5 N, which is 0.01 N.

So plugging into Hooke's Law: F = kx → k = F/x. Let me calculate that. F is 0.01 N, x is 0.05 m. So k = 0.01 / 0.05 = 0.2 N/m. Got it.

Now, the mass is 8 grams. Wait, grams to kilograms, right? Oh yeah, 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 8 grams is 0.008 kg.

Now, plugging into the period formula. T = 2π√(m/k). Let's compute the value inside the square root first. m is 0.008 kg, k is 0.2 N/m. So 0.008 / 0.2 = 0.04. So √0.04 is 0.2. Then T = 2π * 0.2. 

2 * π is approximately 6.283. Multiply by 0.2 gives 1.2566 seconds. Wait, but wait, looking at my calculation again. Let me check:

Wait, 0.008 kg divided by 0.2 N/m. Oh wait, wait, 0.008 / 0.2 is 0.04? Because 0.008 / 0.2 = (8e-3) / (2e-1) ) = (8/2) * (1e-3 / 1e-1) ) = 4 * (1e-2) )= 0.04. Oh yes, so √0.04 is 0.2. So T= 2π * 0.2 = 0.4 * π ≈ 1.2566 seconds. Hmm, wait, but that's about 1.26 seconds. 

Looking at the options, option H is 1.26 sec. But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation because I'm a bit confused. Because when I compute 0.008/0.2, let me do it step by step. 0.008 divided by 0.2. 0.2 is the same as 2e-1. 0.008 is 8e-3. So 8e-3 / 2e-1 = (8/2) * (1e-3 / 1e-1) ) = 4 * (1e-2) → 0.04. So yes, that's correct.

So the square root of 0.04 is 0.2. So 2π * 0.2 is 0.4π, which is approximately 1.2566, about 1.26 seconds. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but looking again, the options are: A: 3.6, B:2.5, C:0.5, D:1.75, E:3.14, F:2.0, G:0.8, H:1.26, I:1.5, J:2.8. So H is 1.26. 

But wait, wait a second. I think I might have messed up the mass. Let me think: the mass is given as 8 grams. Oh, wait, 8 grams is 0.008 kg, correct. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in Hooke's law, people sometimes use different units, like sometimes people mix up grams and kilograms, but 8 grams is 0.008 kg. So I think that's correct.

Hmm, but let's think again: 1000 dynes = 0.01 N. x is 5 cm = 0.05 m. So k=0.01 / 0.05 = 0.2 N/m. Correct.

Then m = 8 grams = 0.008 kg. So m/k is 0.008 / 0.2 → 0.04. Square root is 0.2. Then 2π * 0.2 = 0.4π. 0.4 * 3.1416 is approximately 1.2566 seconds. So about 1.26 seconds, which is option H. 

Wait, but looking back, the given options: option H is 1.26. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the period of the simple harmonic motion, we use the formula for the period of a mass-spring system:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the spring constant \( k \)
Hooke's Law states \( F = kx \), where \( F \) is the force, \( x \) is the displacement, and \( k \) is the spring constant. The problem provides \( F = 1000 \, \text{dynes} \) and \( x = 5 \, \text{cm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \). Converting \( F \) to Newtons:

\[
F = 1000 \, \text{dynes} = 0.01 \, \text{N}
\]

Using \( k = \frac{F}{x} \):

\[
k = \frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.2 \, \text{N/m}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the mass to kilograms
The mass is given as \( 8 \, \text{grams} \). Converting to kilograms:

\[
m = 8 \, \text{g} = 0.008 \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the period \( T \)
Substitute \( m = 0.008 \, \text{kg} \) and \( k = 0.2 \, \text{N/m} \) into the formula:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.008}{0.2}}
\]

First, calculate the ratio inside the square root:

\[
\frac{0.008}{0.2} = 0.04
\]

Then, take the square root:

\[
\sqrt{0.04} = 0.2
\]

Now, calculate \( T \):

\[
T = 2\pi \times 0.2 = 0.4\pi \approx 1.2566 \, \text{seconds}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result with the options
The calculated period is approximately \( 1.26 \, \text{seconds} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
