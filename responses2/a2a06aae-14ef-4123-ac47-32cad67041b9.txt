Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and kernels. Let me try to break it down.

Statement 1 says that SVMs, like logistic regression, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example. I remember that logistic regression typically outputs probabilities, but how about SVMs? I think SVMs can provide probabilities because they use the hinge loss, which is similar to logistic regression's loss function. But wait, maybe it's because they don't maximize the margin in the same way. Wait, no, I think that SVMs can be adapted to provide probability estimates. Oh, right! The Platt Platt reformulation can turn SVMs into probability estimators. So Statement 1 is probably true.

Statement 2 says that support vectors remain the same when moving from a linear kernel to a higher-order polynomial kernel. Hmm, support vectors are the data points that define the decision boundary. If we have a higher-degree polynomial kernel, the feature space is expanded. But does that change which points are support vectors? I think that might depend on the data. For example, a higher-degree kernel might map points into a higher-dimensional space, but if the data is still linearly separable, maybe the same points are still support vectors. But if the data is nonlinear, perhaps new points become support vectors. But in general, if the data isn't separable in the original space, the kernel might not change the support vectors much. So Statement 2 sounds like it's saying the support vectors stay the same, which might not always be the case. So Statement 2 is probably false.

Now looking at the options. The options are pairs of True/False. The options are labeled A to J, with their combinations.

The first statement is about probability distributions, which I believe is true. Statement 2 is about support vectors, which I think is false. So the options that match would be for a pair where the first is True and the second is False.

Looking at the answer options:

Looking at the answer options, option A is True, False. Option E is True, True. Others don't pair correctly.

So the correct pair is A: True, False.

The analysis of the two statements leads to the correct pair being A: True, False.
