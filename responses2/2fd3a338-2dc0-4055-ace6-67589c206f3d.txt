Okay, so I've got this question here about the exchange ratio of two companies, X and Y. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says that the market price of Company X is $45 per share and Company Y is $30 per share. Now, it says that X offers three-fourths a share of common stock for each share of Y. Wait, maybe I'm misreading that. Oh, no, wait. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. If X offers three-fourths a share for each share of Y, does that mean X is offering a fraction of Y's shares? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me read again. It says, "X offers three-fourths a share of common stock for each share of Y." So, for every share Y owns, X is offering 0.75 shares. Hmm. So, if Y owns 1 share, X is buying 0.75 shares. So, in terms of exchange, how does this affect the ratio of their prices?

I think this is about the exchange ratio, which is the number of shares one party offers for each share they receive. So, if Y gets X's shares, what's the exchange ratio? Wait, no. Let me think again. The exchange ratio is the number of shares of one company offered for each share of another. So if X is selling 0.75 shares for each share of Y, then the exchange ratio for Y's shares is how many X shares get bought per Y share. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps the exchange ratio is the number of shares of X given up for each share of Y received. So, if X is offering 0.75 shares of X for each share of Y, then for each Y share, X is selling 0.75 shares. So, the exchange ratio is 0.75 X shares per Y share. But wait, that can't be right, because exchange ratios are usually presented as the number of shares of the other company you're getting for each share you're giving up. So perhaps the exchange ratio between X and Y is 3/4, meaning for every 1 share Y gives up, X gives 3/4 shares. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe I should model this with variables. Let's say Y buys X's shares. So Y is buying X. The exchange ratio is the number of X shares bought per Y share. So, if Y buys X shares, how many X shares does Y buy per Y share? The problem says X offers 0.75 shares for each Y's share. Oh wait, wait, that wording is a bit confusing. Let me clarify: For each share of Y, X is offering 0.75 shares. So, Y is getting 0.75 X shares for each Y share. So the exchange ratio of Y to X is 0.75:1. Or, the exchange ratio is 1:0.75, which is the same as 1/0.75, which is 1.333... So the exchange ratio is 1.333:1, but wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, exchange ratios are often expressed as the number of shares the buyer gets per share of the seller. So, if the exchange ratio is 3/4, that would mean 3/4 shares of the seller (X) are exchanged for each share of the buyer (Y). So, for each Y share, X gives up 0.75. So the ratio of Y's price to X's price would be based on how much each shares are worth. 

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of exchange of market prices. So, I think the exchange ratio is 3/4. So, for every 4 shares of X, you get 3 shares of Y. Because for each Y share, X is offering 3/4. So, 4 Y shares for 3 X shares. So the exchange ratio is 3/4. But wait, the question says what is the ratio of exchange of market prices. So, the price of Y relative to X.

Wait, but the market price of X is $45 and Y is $30. So, if the exchange ratio is 3/4, then for 4 X shares, you get 3 Y shares. So the ratio of X's price to Y's price would be 45 /30 = 1.5. But the question is about the exchange ratio of market prices, which I think is the ratio of the price of X to Y. But wait, no, wait. Exchange ratio is about how much X is exchanged for Y. So, for each Y share, X is sold for 0.75. So the exchange ratio is 0.75 X per Y. But perhaps the question is about the price ratio. So, if Y is being bought at a certain rate relative to X.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this with the concept of exchange ratios. Exchange ratios are typically the number of shares of one company you receive for each share of another. So if the ratio is 3/4, that means for every 1 share of Y, you get 3/4 shares of X. So the exchange ratio would be 3/4.

But wait, the question says that X offers three-fourths a share of common stock for each share of Y. So, for each Y share, X is selling 3/4. So, the exchange ratio is 3/4 X for 1 Y. So, the exchange ratio is 3/4, which is 0.75. But the question is about the ratio of exchange prices. Hmm, exchange price ratio could be the price per share of X relative to Y. Or the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of total value. Let's say Y holds one share. Y's total value is 30. X is offering 0.75 shares for each Y share. So for each Y share, X is giving up 0.75. So the total value in X is 0.75 *45=33.75. So the exchange ratio in terms of value would be 33.75 for each Y share. But the question is about the ratio of exchange of market prices, which I think refers to the ratio of the price per share of X to Y.

So, X's price is 45, Y's is 30. So the ratio is X:Y = 45:30, which simplifies to 3:2. But that's the market price ratio.

Wait, but the question says the ratio of exchange of market prices. Hmm, perhaps that's the exchange ratio, but expressed as the ratio of the prices. So, since X is being sold at 45, and Y bought at 30. But exchange ratio is about the number of shares exchanged, not the price.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The exchange ratio is 3/4. So, the exchange ratio of market prices is 45 to 30, or 3:2. So, the ratio is 3/2, which is 1.5. So, option B is 1.5. So the exchange ratio of market prices would be 1.5, meaning X's price is 1.5 times Y's. Wait, but the question is about the ratio of exchange of market prices, which I thought was the exchange ratio, but in this case, the exchange ratio is 3/4, but the ratio of prices is 45/30=1.5. So, perhaps the answer is 1.5, which is option B.

Wait, but another approach: the exchange ratio is X's price per unit of Y. So, X is being sold at 45 per 3/4 share. So, for each Y share, X is offered at 3/4. So, the exchange rate from Y's perspective is 3/4 X per Y share. So, the ratio of the exchange of market prices would be the price of X divided by the price of Y. So, 45 /30=1.5.

So the correct ratio is 1.5, which is option B.

The question involves determining the ratio of exchange of market prices between Company X and Company Y, given their respective prices and the exchange ratio. Here's the analysis:

1. **Understanding the Exchange Ratio**: The exchange ratio is the number of shares of one company exchanged for each share of another. In this case, for every 1 share of Y, X is offering 0.75 shares. Thus, the exchange ratio of Y to X is 1:0.75, or 1/0.75 = 1.333... (since the exchange ratio is typically expressed as the number of shares of the buyer per share of the seller).

2. **Market Prices**: Company X's stock is priced at $45 per share, and Company Y's stock is priced at $30 per share.

3. **Exchange Ratio of Prices**: The exchange ratio of market prices refers to the ratio of X's price to Y's price. This is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Exchange Ratio of Prices} = \frac{\text{Price of X}}{\text{Price of Y}} = \frac{45}{30} = 1.5
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The ratio of exchange of market prices is 1.5, which corresponds to option B.
