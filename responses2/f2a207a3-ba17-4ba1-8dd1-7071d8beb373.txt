Question:

One evening, a defendant set fire to a homeowner's occupied house. As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed. The defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second count of the two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the defendant's right to a fair trial was violated by the inconsistent verdicts.
B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.
C: denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.
D: denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.
E: granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.
F: granted, because the verdicts contradict each other, raising reasonable doubt.
G: granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.
H: denied, because the jury found sufficient evidence to convict on the first count, regardless of the second count outcome.
I: granted, because the defendant was not directly responsible for the death.

Okay, so I've got this criminal law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that a defendant sets fire to a homeowner's house, killing their daughter. The charges are felony murder and arson, making it a two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of arson. The question is about the defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict for the first charge versus the second.

The options are A to H, and I need to pick the correct one. I remember that in criminal law, especially with inconsistent verdicts, there are specific rules about how to handle such cases.

So, the key here is whether the first verdict (guilty) is a valid exception. In some jurisdictions, a party can object to a conviction that's inconsistent with a subsequent verdict. But I think the main idea is that if the second charge is a separate count and the first is an exception, you have to see if that exception is valid.

I remember something about a "right to a fair trial" being an exception. But the question is about whether the verdicts are a reversible error. So, if the first count's verdict is an exception, does that mean the second can't be overturned?

Wait, in the context of two-countIndictments, if the first count is guilty, the second might be either guilty or not guilty. If the second is found not guilty, that's a separate case. But the issue is whether the first verdict is a valid exception.

I think the general rule is that a trial by a jury can be set aside if the verdicts are inconsistent with each other. But only if the counts are separate. So, for example, if you have two separate counts, each being a separate charge, and if the verdicts on each are inconsistent, then that could be a matter for the court to decide.

Wait, but in some cases, a single charge can be an exception. Like, if the first count is a felony murder, and the second is an independent charge, then if the second is found not guilty, does that affect the first?

Hmm, maybe I should think about the concept of "inconsistent verdicts." The rule about this is that a single count's verdict can be an exception to a subsequent verdict if the subsequent verdict is a different charge and the counts areSeparate. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Wait, but in the case of a second-count Indictment, if the first count is an exception (like a guilty verdict), does that affect the second? I think that a single count's verdict can be an exception to a subsequent verdict if the subsequent verdict is a different charge and the counts are separate. So if the first count's verdict is guilty, the second might be only an exception if it's a different charge.

Wait, but in this case, both counts are separate. So, if the first count is guilty, the second count could be either guilty or not guilty. But if the second is found not guilty, then the first is a valid exception, but the second verdict is not a separate count's verdict; it's not a separate charge's verdict.

Wait, but the question is about the second count. So, the second count was found not guilty. So if the first count's verdict is guilty, and the second is found not guilty, is that a reversible error? Or does it mean the first verdict is an exception, but the second isn't?

I think that a proper exception is that the first count is guilty, so the second count's verdict isn't a separate charge. In that case, the second count's verdict being not guilty is not a separate matter for the court to decide. So the second verdict is a matter of fact, not a matter of law. So, the second count's verdict is not an exception.

Wait, but the question is about the defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count. So, if the second count is not guilty, does that mean the first count's verdict is a valid exception, and the second can't be overturned? Or is that not the case?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the options again. The options are A to H.

Option B says the verdict is final and cannot be overturned. That would mean that the second verdict isn't a matter of law, so it's a final verdict, and the first's guilty verdict is an exception. But also, the second's verdict is a separate charge, so that's not an exception.

Wait, but in reality, if the second count is a separate Indictment, and the first's verdict is guilty, the second can't be an exception. So the second's verdict can't be a matter of law. So the second count's verdict (not guilty) is a matter of law, meaning the first's verdict is a valid exception. So the second verdict can't be overturned because it's a separate charge, and the second count's verdict is a matter of law. Therefore, the second verdict's not guilty is a final verdict, and the first's guilty is an exception.

But wait, in the question, the second verdict is not guilty. So, if the first is guilty, the second can't be an exception. So, the second's verdict is a matter of law, meaning it's final. So the first's verdict is an exception, but the second can't be changed because it's a separate charge.

But the question is about the defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count. So, if the second count's verdict is a matter of law (not guilty), then the first's verdict is a valid exception, but the second's verdict can't be changed. So the second's verdict is a matter of fact and not a matter of law.

Wait, but the first count's verdict being guilty is an exception to a subsequent verdict. So the first count is guilty, so the second count's verdict is not a separate charge. So the second count's verdict being not guilty is a matter of law, so the first's verdict is an exception, but the second's verdict can't be set aside.

But the options are about whether the verdicts are a reversible error. So, the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count is granted if the first is a valid exception and the second's verdict is a matter of law, meaning it's final.

Wait, but in the options, I think the correct approach would be that the first count is guilty, so the second count's verdict (not guilty) is a matter of law, so the second verdict cannot be overturned. Hence, the first's guilty verdict is an exception, meaning the first's verdict is valid. So the second's verdict is not a matter of law, so the second can't be set aside.

But the question is about the defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count. So, if the second is not guilty, then the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the first's verdict is not a reversible error. Therefore, the motion to set aside the guilty verdict would be granted because the first was guilty and an exception.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The case is that the first count's verdict is guilty, and the second is not guilty. Since the second count is a separate Indictment, and it's a matter of law, the second's verdict can't be set aside. Therefore, the first's verdict is a valid exception, but the second's verdict is final.

Therefore, the defendant's motion to set aside the first's guilty verdict would be granted because the first was guilty and the second's verdict is a matter of law, so it's not a reversible error.

Looking at the options, option A is "granted, because the defendant's right to a fair trial was violated by the inconsistent verdicts." But I'm not sure if the right to a fair trial is violated here. Alternatively, another option is B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.

Wait, but the issue is whether the second verdict (not guilty) is a matter of law. If it's a matter of law, then it can't be overturned, so the first's verdict is an exception. So the first's verdict being guilty is a valid exception, so the verdict is not a reversible error. So the defendant can set it aside, so the motion would be granted.

So which option says that the verdicts are not a reversible error, meaning the verdicts are final and the first is an exception. Let me check the options:

Option B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned. So if the second verdict is a matter of law, that's not a reversible error, so the motion to set aside the first is granted.

Wait, but the correct scenario is that the first was guilty, and the second's verdict is a matter of law (not guilty). Therefore, the first is an exception, and the second is not a matter of law, so the second's verdict is final. Therefore, the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted. So the defendant can set the guilty verdict aside.

Looking at the options, option A is about a violation of the right to a fair trial. I'm not sure if the right to a fair trial is being violated here. Alternatively, option B says the verdict is final and can't be overturned, but the issue is whether the verdicts are a reversible error, not the right to a fair trial.

Wait, but the right to a fair trial is a separate issue. The question is about whether the verdicts are a reversible error. So option B's reasoning would apply if the verdict is final and can't be overturned. But in this case, the verdicts are inconsistent, so the first is an exception. Therefore, the second's verdict can't be overturned, but the first's verdict is valid.

So the motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted because the first was guilty and the second's verdict is a matter of law, meaning it's final. So the verdicts are not a reversible error, so the motion is granted.

Looking at the options again, option B says the verdict is final and can't be overturned. But in reality, the second verdict is a matter of law, so it's not a reversible error. Therefore, the motion is granted, and option B's reasoning may not be correct.

Oh wait, but option A says the verdicts violate the right to a fair trial, which is a different issue. But the question is about the verdicts being a reversible error, not the fairness.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B: the verdicts are final and can't be overturned. Because in this case, the second verdict is a matter of law, so it's final, and the first is an exception, so the second's verdict can't be changed. Therefore, the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the motion is granted.

Wait, but the question is about the defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count. So the motion is against the first verdict being guilty. Therefore, if the second verdict is a matter of law, the first is a valid exception. So the motion is granted.

So, looking at the options, option B says the verdict is final and cannot be overturned. But in this case, the second verdict is a matter of law, so it's final, and the first is an exception. So the motion is granted, but the reasoning is that the second verdict can't be overturned. So the reasoning in option B seems correct, but the actual verdicts are inconsistent, so the first is an exception.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B because the second verdict is a matter of law, thus not a reversible error. So the motion is granted because the first verdict is guilty and the second is not a matter of law, hence the first's verdict is a valid exception.

So, the options that say the verdicts are not a reversible error. So, which option says that?

Looking again:

Option B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.

Option A: granted, because the defendant's right to a fair trial was violated by the inconsistent verdicts.

Wait, but I'm not sure about option A. The right to a fair trial is a separate issue. If the verdicts are inconsistent, that's an issue of fact, not the right to a fair trial. Because the right to a fair trial is about the defendant's rights, not about the accuracy of the verdicts.

Therefore, the correct reasoning would be that the second verdict is a matter of law, hence not a reversible error. So the motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted.

Looking at the options, option B says that the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned. However, in this case, the second verdict is a matter of law, so it's final. Therefore, the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the motion is granted.

So, the correct answer is B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned. Wait, no, because the first verdict is guilty, and the second is not a matter of law, so the second's verdict is final. So option B's reasoning is that the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned, but only the second's verdict is a matter of law.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it this way: if the first count is guilty, and the second is a separate matter, the second verdict (not guilty) is a matter of law, so it's final. The first's verdict is an exception, so the first's verdict is valid. Therefore, the motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted.

Looking at the options, which one says that the verdicts are not a reversible error?

Option B says the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned. But that's true for the second verdict. However, the first's verdict being guilty is a valid exception, so the first's verdict is not a reversible error. So the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count is granted.

So, which option is correct? Let me see.

Option B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned. But in reality, the second verdict is a matter of law, so it's final, but the first's verdict is an exception. So the motion is granted because the second's verdict can't be changed, but the first's is an exception. So the reasoning in option B is correct, but the verdicts are not a reversible error, so the motion is granted.

Wait, but the question is about whether the verdicts are a reversible error. So, if the second verdict is a matter of law, then it's not a reversible error. So the motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted.

Looking at the options, option B says the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned. So, the verdicts would be final, but the first's verdict is an exception.

So, the correct answer would be that the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned (because the second is a matter of law), so the first's verdict is valid and the motion is granted.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned. Let me check the options.

Option B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.

So, the motion is denied because the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned. But in reality, the second verdict is a matter of law, so it's final, but the first's verdict is an exception.

So, in this scenario, the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count is granted because the first was guilty and the second is a matter of law, so the second can't be changed. So, the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the motion is granted.

Looking again, which option says that the verdicts are a matter of law, hence not a reversible error.

Option B says it's a matter of law, so it's final, so the first's verdict is a valid exception.

So, the motion is granted because the first's verdict is guilty and the second is a matter of law, so the second can't be changed. Therefore, the motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted.

So, the correct answer is B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned. Wait, no, because the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the motion is granted. So, the correct answer would be that the verdicts are not a reversible error, so the motion is granted.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says the verdicts are not a reversible error. Let me look at the options again.

The options are A to H.

Looking at the options, option B says the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned. Option C says denied for non-constitutional error. Option D denies for reversible error.

In the scenario, the verdicts are inconsistent, but the second verdict is a matter of law. So, the second's verdict is final, but the first's verdict is a valid exception. Therefore, the first's verdict is not a reversible error.

So the defendant's motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted because the first was guilty and the second is a matter of law (not guilty), making the second verdict final and not a reversible error. Thus, the motion is granted.

So, which option reflects this? Option B says the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned. So that's true for the second verdict, but the first's verdict is an exception, so the motion is granted.

Wait, but the options:

Option B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.

But in reality, the second verdict is a matter of law, so it's final, but the first's verdict is an exception. So the motion is granted because the first's verdict is a valid exception, despite the second being a matter of law.

So the correct option would be B, because it's about the second verdict being final. But the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the motion is granted.

Wait, another thought: a defendant can object to a verdict that's inconsistent with a subsequent verdict. So if the second count's verdict is not a matter of law, then the subsequent verdict can't be changed, so the prior verdict can't be changed either. So the first's verdict being guilty and the second being not a matter of law, the second's verdict can't be overturned. So the first's verdict is a valid exception.

But the options don't have an option that says the first's verdict is a valid exception. So, the motion is granted because the first was guilty and the second is not a matter of law, so the second's verdict is final and the first's cannot be overturned. Therefore, the motion is granted.

So, the correct option is B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned. Wait, that can't be right because the second's verdict is a matter of law, so it's final, but the first's is an exception.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the verdicts are inconsistent, so the first's verdict is guilty, the second is not a matter of law (so not a possible verdict), so the second's verdict can't be overturned. Therefore, the motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted.

Looking at the options, option B says the verdicts are final and cannot be overturned. But in reality, the second verdict is a matter of law, so it's final, but the first's is a valid exception. So, the motion is granted, but the reasoning in option B is correct (the second is final). However, the first's is an exception, so the motion is granted.

But the options don't have an option that says the verdicts are inconsistent and thus the first's is an exception. Wait, I think the correct answer is A: granted, because the right to a fair trial was violated. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the correct answer is option B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of it in terms of the possible outcomes.

In the scenario, the first count's verdict is guilty, the second count's verdict is not a matter of law. So, the second verdict is final, and the first's is an exception. So the motion to set aside the first's verdict is granted because the first's was a valid exception.

So, the correct reasoning would be that the verdict is final for the second count, so the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the motion is granted. Therefore, the correct answer would be option B, because the second's verdict is a matter of law, hence final, and the first's is an exception, so the motion is granted.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says the verdicts are inconsistent and the first's is an exception. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: granted, because right to a fair trial was violated.

B: denied, because jury's final.

C: denied, because not a constitutional error.

D: denied, because verdicts are a reversible error.

E: same as D.

F: same as E.

G: same as F.

H: same as G.

Wait, now I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the steps again.

The defendant's motion is to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count. So, the first count's verdict is guilty, and the second is a separate charge.

The second count's verdict is a matter of law (not guilty), so it's final. The first's is an exception, so the motion is granted.

So, the correct reasoning is that the verdict is final for the second count, so the first's verdict is a valid exception. Therefore, the motion is granted.

Now, looking at the options, which one reflects that the motion is granted because the first was guilty and the second's is a matter of law, making the first's verdict an exception.

The options don't have an option that says the verdicts are inconsistent and the first's is an exception. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me think of it in terms of the possible outcomes.

The first count's verdict is guilty. The second is not a matter of law, so it's final. The first's verdict is an exception, so the motion is granted.

So, the correct reasoning is that the second's verdict is a matter of law, so it's final, and the first's verdict is a valid exception, so the motion is granted.

So, the correct answer is B: denied, because the jury's decision is final and cannot be overturned.

Wait, no, because the first's verdict is an exception, so the motion is granted. So, the correct answer would be option B only if the verdicts were inconsistent. But in reality, they're inconsistent, but the second's verdict is a matter of law.

So, I'm not confident, but based on the reasoning I've done, the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count is granted because the first count's verdict is guilty, and the second count's verdict is a matter of law (not guilty). Since the second count's verdict is a matter of law, it is final, and the first count's verdict cannot be changed. Therefore, the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the first count is granted because the second count's verdict is a matter of law, making the first count's verdict a valid exception.

ANSWER: B
