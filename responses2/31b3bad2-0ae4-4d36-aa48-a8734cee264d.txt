Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these rotational mechanics and kinematics problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a person's arm swinging through an angle of 45 degrees in 0.5 seconds. So, during each swing, the arm moves with constant speed. I'm supposed to find the acceleration of a drop of blood in the fingertips at the bottom of the swing. The drop of blood is 1.0 gram, which is 0.001 kilograms.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that centripetal acceleration is the acceleration towards the center of the circular path, which is what's happening here as the arm swings down. The formula I think I need is a = v² / r, but wait, since it's circular motion, maybe I should think about angular terms.

Wait, another thought: the blood drop is moving along a circular arc, so the centripetal acceleration is what causes it to speed up. But wait, in this case, the person is walking, so the arm is moving with constant speed during each swing. Oh, right, so the linear speed is constant.

Wait, if the speed is constant, then the magnitude of the velocity is same throughout, but the direction is changing. So, the acceleration is centripetal, which is directed towards the center. So, the acceleration is v² divided by the radius.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if the arm's movement implies that the speed is constant. The problem says, "as a reasonable approximation, we can assume that the arm moves with constant speed during each swing." Oh, so that would mean the tangential speed is constant. So, the centripetal acceleration would be a = v² / r.

But wait, another approach: think about the motion as a circular segment. The angle is 45 degrees, which is 45/360 = 1/8 of a circle. The time taken to complete this is 0.5 seconds. So, the angular speed ω is 2π radians divided by the time. Wait, but wait, because the arm moves through 45 degrees in 0.5s, not a full circle. So, the angular displacement θ is 45 degrees, which is π/4 radians.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the speed is constant, then the angular speed is constant. So, the average angular speed is ω = θ / t. So, ω = (π/4) / 0.5 = π/(4*0.5) = π/2 rad/s.

But wait, wait, that's the average angular speed. Since it's moving with constant speed, that's the same as the instantaneous speed. So, the angular speed is constant. So, the linear speed v = ω * r, where r is the length of the arm. Wait, the arm is 70 cm long, measured from the shoulder. So, r is 0.7 meters.

So, v = ω * r = (π/2) * 0.7 m/s.

Wait, let me compute that: π/2 is approximately 1.5708, multiplied by 0.7 is about 1.1 m/s. So, v is about 1.1 m/s.

Now, the centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r. Let's compute that. v squared is (1.1)^2 = 1.21 m²/s². Divided by r=0.7 m, so 1.21 / 0.7 ≈ 1.7286 m/s².

Wait, but the options are given. Let me check the options:

Options: A:1.22, B:2.45, C:1.95, D:3.00, E:1.50, F:1.73, G:0.98, H:2.00, I:3.50, J:2.90.

Hmm, wait, I got about 1.728, which is approximately 1.73, which is option F. But wait, another thought: maybe I made a mistake in the angular speed? Let me double-check.

Wait, θ is 45 degrees, which is π/4 radians. Time is 0.5 seconds. So, angular speed ω = θ / t = (π/4) / 0.5 = (π/4) * (2) = π/2 rad/s. That's correct.

v = ω * r = (pi/2) * 0.7. Pi is about 3.1416, so 0.7 * 3.1416 is about 2.199, divided by 2 is 1.0995 m/s. Wait, wait, wait, no: 0.7 * pi/2 is 0.7 * 1.5708 = 1.0995 m/s. So, v ≈ 1.1 m/s.

v squared is (1.1)^2 = 1.21. Divided by 0.7 (r) gives 1.728 m/s². So, approximately 1.73. Which is option F.

Wait, but wait, another approach: maybe we can consider the motion as a circular path with radius r, and the time for the swing is 0.5 seconds. Since the arm is moving through 45 degrees (π/4 radians), the angular displacement is Δθ = ω * Δt.

Wait, but since the speed is constant, the angular speed is constant. So, the angular velocity is ω = Δθ / Δt = (pi/4) / 0.5 = pi/2.

But wait, perhaps I'm confusing angular velocity with linear speed. Let me make sure. No, for uniform circular motion, the speed is v = r * ω. So, that's correct.

Wait, another thing: the drop of blood is moving in a circle, so the acceleration is towards the center. The centripetal acceleration is v² / r.

Wait, but I could also think in terms of the kinematic equations. Since the speed is constant, the acceleration is entirely centripetal. So, a = v² / r.

Yes, so the calculation I did earlier gives about 1.73. So, the closest option is F:1.73.

Wait, but another thought: another way to think about it is to compute the linear acceleration using the angular acceleration, but since the speed is constant, angular acceleration is zero. So, the acceleration is purely centripetal, not involving angular acceleration terms.

Wait, another check: the blood drop is moving along a circular path of radius 0.7 meters. At the bottom of the swing, which is the point where it's moving fastest, so the acceleration is maximum.

But wait, using the formula a = v² / r, that's correct because in circular motion, the centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r.

So, to recap:

v = (pi/2) * 0.7 m/s ≈ 1.1 m/s.

a = (1.1)^2 / 0.7 ≈ 1.21 / 0.7 ≈ 1.728 m/s².

So the answer should be approximately 1.73, which is option F.

To determine the acceleration of a 1.0 g drop of blood in the fingertips at the bottom of the swing, we analyze the motion as circular motion with constant speed. The arm is 70.0 cm long (0.7 m) and swings through a 45° angle (π/4 radians) in 0.5 seconds. Since the speed is constant, the angular speed is uniform:

1. **Angular Speed (ω):**  
   Using θ = ωt, where θ = π/4 and t = 0.5 s:  
   \[
   \omega = \frac{\theta}{t} = \frac{\pi/4}{0.5} = \frac{\pi}{2} \, \text{rad/s}.
   \]

2. **Linear Speed (v):**  
   The linear speed is given by \( v = r\omega \), where \( r = 0.7 \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   v = 0.7 \times \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.0995 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

3. **Centripetal Acceleration (a):**  
   The centripetal acceleration is \( a = \frac{v^2}{r} \):  
   \[
   a = \frac{(1.0995)^2}{0.7} \approx \frac{1.21}{0.7} \approx 1.728 \, \text{m/s}^2.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The calculated acceleration (approximately 1.73 m/s²) matches option F (1.73).
