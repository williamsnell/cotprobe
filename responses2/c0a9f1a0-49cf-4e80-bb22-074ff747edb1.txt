Okay, so I've got this economics question here about lump-sum taxes and their effects on Net National Product (NNP). Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question says that the government is levying a lump-sum tax which reduces disposable income by $50 billion. And we're given that the Marginal Propensity to save (MPS) is 0.25. The options are A to J, with various dollar amounts. I need to figure out what the effect of this tax will be on NNP.

Wait, what's NNP again? Oh right, NNP is the total value of goods and services produced within a country during a year. Unlike GDP, which can include imports, NNP is self-contained. So a lump-sum tax would affect NNP in a certain way.

I remember that a lump-sum tax doesn't depend on the level of income, so it doesn't change the MPC (marginal propensity to consume) directly. But it does affect the aggregate demand because it reduces disposable income. Since disposable income is part of aggregate demand, this would affect the overall economy.

But wait, the question is about how this affects NNP. So I'm thinking about the multiplier effect. The multiplier is 1 divided by (1 - MPC). Since MPS is 0.25, the MPC would be 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. So the multiplier would be 1/(1 - 0.75) = 1/0.25 = 4. So any change in disposable income would be multiplied by 4 to get the change in total demand, which affects NNP.

Wait, but the tax itself is a transfer payment, not a consumption tax. So the impact on NNP would be different. Let me think again. A lump-sum tax directly reduces disposable income, which is part of aggregate expenditure. Since the question is about NNP, not GDP, the tax would directly reduce NNP by the amount of the tax, because it's a direct subtraction from NNP without affecting the MPC in the same way as a consumption tax.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify. A lump-sum tax is a transfer payment, which is a type of fiscal policy. It doesn't affect the MPC because it's a one-time payment. So the impact on the economy is that it reduces disposable income, which then reduces consumption. But for NNP, it's a direct subtraction from the national income. So if the government takes $50 billion as a lump-sum, that's a reduction in NNP by $50 billion. Wait, but that can't be right because in the context of the economy, when you take a lump-sum, it's a direct subtraction from NNP, but it also affects the overall aggregate demand.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up NNP and GDP. Let me think about it. The tax is levied on disposable income. So if the government reduces disposable income by $50 billion, that's part of the aggregate demand. The multiplier effect would cause the total demand to change, which in turn affects NNP.

Wait, but NNP is the total output, so an increase in disposable income would increase NNP. Wait no, the tax is a reduction, so NNP would decrease by the amount of the tax. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because it's a direct tax. Hmm, maybe not. Let's look at the formula.

The formula for the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So if the MPC is 0.75, then the multiplier is 4. So a $50 billion reduction in disposable income would lead to a change in aggregate expenditure of -50 * 4 = -200 billion, which would reduce GDP by $200 billion. But NNP is like GDP minus imports, but if it's a transfer payment, it's a part of the national income but not part of the consumption. So in this case, because the tax is a lump-sum, it doesn't affect the MPC; it just reduces disposable income. 

Wait, but the question is about the effect on NNP. Let me think: the net effect on NNP would be the same as the change in disposable income, because the tax is a direct tax on the income, and NNP is the total value of goods and services produced. So the tax directly subtracts $50 billion from NNP. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and the options don't have $50 billion as the answer, actually, option A is $50 billion. But wait, the options don't include that as the correct answer. So I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe I should think about the difference between tax on consumption and tax on disposable income. A consumption tax would change MPC, while a lump-sum tax doesn't. So a lump-sum tax would reduce disposable income, which lowers consumption, but for NNP, the tax directly subtracts from the income (since it's a transfer). So the effect on NNP would be a reduction of $50 billion. But that's not one of the options. Wait, looking back, option A is $50 billion. But the options are A: $50, B: $87.5, etc. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct effect on NNP is $50 billion reduced because the tax is a lump-sum. No, that doesn't fit. Let me think again. The tax is levied on disposable income. So an additional $50 billion reduction in disposable income will mean that the total demand decreases by 50 * 4 = $200 billion. But NNP is the total production, so the change in NNP would be the same as the change in total demand because it's a direct tax. Oh wait, no. Wait, the tax is a subtraction from the income, which is part of the aggregate demand. So the total demand would decrease by 50 billion, which leads to a decrease in NNP by $50 billion. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up NNP with GDP. Let me think about GDP and NNP. GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in the economy. NNP is GDP minus net exports. If the government is imposing a lump-sum tax, that's a direct tax on income, which is part of the income basis of GDP. So this tax would reduce the GDP by $50 billion. But since NNP is GDP minus net exports, the reduction in GDP would directly reduce NNP by $50 billion. So the effect on NNP would be a decrease of $50 billion. But that's not one of the options. Wait, looking at the options, option A is $50 billion. So that's the first thought. But the options don't have A as the correct answer. Wait, looking at the options, the first option is A: $50. But wait, the question is, the lump-sum tax reduces disposable income by $50 billion. So the tax is $50 billion. That would directly reduce NNP by $50 billion. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the tax's effect on NNP. Let me think again. A lump-sum tax is a transfer payment, so it doesn't change the MPC. The reduction in disposable income leads to a reduction in consumption, but it also affects the national income. So when the government takes away $50 billion as a lump-sum, that reduces NNP by $50 billion. So the effect on NNP would be a reduction of $50 billion. So the answer would be option A. But in the options, the first option is A: $50 billion. So why is that not the correct choice? Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept here.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as a direct tax, which would reduce disposable income, thus reducing consumption. But for NNP, it's a part of the income. Wait, no, because the tax is levied on disposable income, which is part of the income of the residents. So the tax directly reduces their income, hence reducing their consumption. But for NNP, which is the total production, the tax is a direct deduction, so NNP would decrease by the tax amount. So in this case, the answer would be $50 billion reduction, which is option A. But the options don't have that as correct. Wait, looking back, option A is $50, which is the tax amount itself. So if the tax is $50 billion, then the NNP would be reduced by $50 billion. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but the options are given as A to J, with A being $50. So according to this, the correct answer would be A. But I'm a bit confused because the initial thought was $50 billion, but the options have it as A. However, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, another approach: the tax is a lump-sum, so it's a direct tax. The MPC is 0.75, so the multiplier is 4. So the change in disposable income is -$50 billion. The change in total demand is -50 * 4 = -200 billion. This change would affect NNP. But the change in NNP is the same as the change in total demand because it's a tax on income. Therefore, the NNP would decrease by $200 billion. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I've made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the impact on NNP, which is different. Wait, another way: I've heard that when the government imposes a lump-sum tax, it doesn't affect the MPC but affects the multiplier. So the tax directly reduces disposable income, which affects aggregate demand. But because it's a lump-sum, it doesn't change the MPC. So the change in NNP would be the same as the change in disposable income, which is $50 billion reduction. So the correct answer should be $50 billion reduction. But the options say option A is $50 billion. So the correct answer would be A, but perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, but the options don't have a negative option. So perhaps the question is about the change in NNP, which is a direct deduction, so the impact is a decrease of $50 billion. So the effect is that NNP would be $50 billion less, so the effect is a reduction of $50 billion. So the answer is A.

But wait, let me think again. The question is, what effect does this lump-sum tax have on NNP? The tax directly reduces disposable income, which is part of the income of the people, so when they consume, their income is reduced. But NNP is the total output. So a lump-sum tax would directly reduce NNP by the amount of the tax, because it's a subtraction. So the impact on NNP is a decrease of $50 billion, which is option A.

But looking back at the options, the first option is A: $50 billion. So that would be the correct answer. So the answer should be A.

The question involves analyzing the impact of a lump-sum tax on Net National Product (NNP) given that the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 0.25. 

A lump-sum tax directly reduces disposable income by $50 billion. Since the tax is a transfer payment, it does not affect the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). However, the tax reduces disposable income, which in turn reduces consumption. The multiplier effect is calculated as 1 / (1 - MPC). With MPC = 1 - MPS = 0.75, the multiplier is 1 / 0.25 = 4. Therefore, the change in total demand is -50 billion * 4 = -200 billion. 

However, the question specifically asks about the effect on NNP (Net National Product). A lump-sum tax directly reduces NNP by the amount of the tax, as it is a direct deduction from the national income. Thus, the reduction in NNP is $50 billion. 

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:
