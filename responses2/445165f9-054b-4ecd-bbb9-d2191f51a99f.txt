Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the phrase "Guru-Panth" in Sikh traditions. I'm trying to remember what each part means. Let me think. First, "Guru" in Sikh means a teacher or a guide. So the word "Guru-Panth" combines these two terms. I think it's related to the spiritual journey that Guru offers. 

I recall that in Sikhism, a Guru is a teacher, and Panth refers to the spiritual path. So combining them, "Guru-Panth" should mean the path itself. So looking at the options, option G is "Worship," but that's more about the practice, not the path. Option J is "Path of enlightenment," which seems to fit because the Guru leads people to this path.

Other options: A is a journey, which is part of it, but the phrase itself is the path. B says "Sacred hymn" â€“ that's a part of the Sikh rituals, so probably not. C is "Community," which is part of the Sikh community but not the phrase. D is "Apprenticeship," which is a different concept. E is " Scripture," that's more about the teachings from the Vedas. F is "Ritual practices," which are separate. I is "Teacher-student relationship," which is more about the interaction between a teacher and student, not the path. So the correct answer should be G: Worship, but wait, no, that's not right because the phrase refers to the path, not worship. So I think the correct answer is J: Path of enlightenment.
