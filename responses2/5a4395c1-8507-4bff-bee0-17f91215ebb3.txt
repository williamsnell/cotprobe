Okay, so I've got this question about cobalt-60 radiation. Hmm, I remember that cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope used in radiation therapy for cancer. I think it's produced by bombarding cobalt-59 with something. Wait, what's the process again?

I recall that cobalt-59 can be bombarded with a certain particle to produce cobalt-60. I'm trying to remember which particles that is. Let me think. Cobalt-59 is a nucleus, and when it absorbs a neutron, it can turn into cobalt-60. Because the mass number increases by one, right? So the reaction would be something like Co-59 plus a neutron becomes Co-60.

So the question is asking which of the options is the particle that's being used. The options are gamma rays, neutrons, ultraviolet, beta, etc. Oh wait, the correct particle is a neutron. So the answer should be option B, which is neutrons.

Let me double-check. Cobalt-60 is produced by neutron bombardment of cobalt-59. The options list neutron as option B, so that's correct. Other options don't fit: gamma rays are high-energy photons, so not relevant here. Electrons would be beta particles, which are emitted in beta decay. Uvrays are X-rays, but the question is about neutron production, so those don't fit. So yes, the correct choice is B.

The correct answer is **B: Neutrons**. Cobalt-60 is produced by neutron bombardment of cobalt-59, and this process is essential in radiation therapy for cancer treatment. The other options do not align with this process: gamma rays, ultraviolet light, beta particles, X-rays, or protons do not fit the description of neutron bombardment. 

Answer: B
