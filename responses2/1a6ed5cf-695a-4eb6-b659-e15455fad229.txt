Alright, so I've got this question about how many Americans believed in the Holocaust in 1943. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through.

Okay, first, I remember that the Holocaust was a significant event in history where millions of Jews were killed by the Nazis. The Holocaust is a widely recognized fact, so I'm guessing a lot of people were aware of it. But the question is specifically about how many believed in it.

I'm trying to recall if there was a general consensus among Americans about this. I think most people, including the majority, probably believed in the Holocaust because it's a widely accepted fact. But wait, maybe not everyone had that belief. I don't think it was a majority; I'm not sure.

Wait, I've heard that in some regions, people might have varying opinions. But for the entire population, especially the majority, probably there was a strong belief. So, if the question is about the total number of Americans, maybe it's the majority who believed. Let's see, the options are from 10 to 90%.

Option D is 70%, which is a majority. Option A is 80%, which is even more. But I'm not sure if it was 70% or higher. Alternatively, perhaps the majority thought it was true.

Wait, another angle: I recall that some people might have been against it, but most were pro. So the majority believed in it. So, 70% would be the majority. But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous because it says "how many believed." So, if 70% of Americans believed, that would be correct.

Alternatively, I think that in the U.S., around 70% of people thought it was true, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of other sources. Oh, I remember reading that the Holocaust was a widely accepted fact in many countries, but perhaps in the U.S., the majority did believe. So the answer would be 70%, which is option D.

The Holocaust is a widely accepted historical fact, and most Americans, including the majority, believed in it. Therefore, in 1943, approximately 70% of Americans believed in the Holocaust.

Answer: D
