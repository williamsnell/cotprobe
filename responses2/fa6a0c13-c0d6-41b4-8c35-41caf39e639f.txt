Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The problem says that a chemist found an unknown element X. The atomic weight of X is 210.197 amu, and it's made up of only two isotopes: ^210X and ^212X. The masses of these isotopes are given as 209.64 amu and 211.66 amu respectively. The question is asking for the relative abundance of the two isotopes. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I remember that the atomic weight of an element is a weighted average of the masses of its naturally occurring isotopes. So, the formula I think is something like: 

Weighted average = (abundance of isotope1 * mass of isotope1) + (abundance of isotope2 * mass of isotope2)

But since the two isotopes are the only ones, their abundances add up to 100%. Let me denote the abundance of ^210X as 'a' and the abundance of ^212X as 'b'. So, a + b = 100% or 1.

The atomic weight given is 210.197 amu. So, plugging into the formula:

210.197 = a * 209.64 + b * 211.66

But since a + b = 1, I can express 'b' as 1 - a. So substituting:

210.197 = a * 209.64 + (1 - a) * 211.66

Let me compute that. Let's expand the right side:

210.197 = (209.64 a) + (211.66 - 211.66 a)
Combine like terms:
210.197 = 209.64 a - 211.66 a + 211.66
Wait, that would be 209.64 a + 211.66(1 - a) = 210.197.

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Let me write the equation again:

210.197 = 209.64 a + 211.66 (1 - a)

Expanding the right side:

209.64 a + 211.66 - 211.66 a = 210.197

Combine like terms: (209.64 - 211.66) a + 211.66 = 210.197

Calculate 209.64 - 211.66. Let's see, 209 is 200+9, 211 is 200+11. So 209.64 is 209.64, 211.66 is 211.66. So 209.64 - 211.66 = -2.02.

So the equation becomes:

-2.02 a + 211.66 = 210.197

Now, subtract 211.66 from both sides:

-2.02 a = 210.197 - 211.66

Compute 210.197 - 211.66. That's approximately -1.463.

So,

-2.02 a = -1.463

Divide both sides by -2.02:

a = (-1.463) / (-2.02) ≈ 1.463 / 2.02.

Let me compute that. 1.463 divided by 2.02. Hmm, 2.02 times 0.7 is 1.414. So 0.7 gives 1.414, which is less than 1.463. The difference is 0.049. 0.049 / 2.02 is about 0.024. So approximately 0.7 + 0.024 = 0.724.

So a is approximately 72.4%, which would make b 27.6%? Let me check these calculations again for any errors.

Wait, perhaps I should do the division more accurately.

1.463 divided by 2.02.

Let me compute 2.02 * x = 1.463.

x = 1.463 / 2.02.

Hmm, 2.02 times 0.7 is 1.414. 1.463 -1.414 = 0.049.

So 0.049 / 2.02 ≈ 0.0243.

So total x is 0.7 + 0.0243 = 0.7243, which is 72.43%.

So a ≈ 72.43% → approximately 72.4%, which would make b 100% -72.4% = 27.6%.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 72.42% and 27.58%. Oh, that's very close. Option C is 72.42% and 27.58%. Wait, wait, my calculation gives 72.43%, but option C is 72.42%, which is correct if I compute more precisely.

Wait, maybe I should compute 1.463 divided by 2.02 more accurately.

Let me write it as 1463 / 2020, perhaps?

Wait, 202 × 7 = 1414. 202 * 7.2 = 202*(7 + 0.2) = 1414 + 40.4 = 1454.4. Hmm, 202 * 7.24 = 1454.4 + (202 *0.04)= 1454.4 + 8.08= 1462.48. 

Wait, 202 ×7.24 = 1462.48. But I have 1463 divided by 202.

Hmm, so 1462.48 is 7.24 times 202. So 1463 is 7.24 + (0.52/202) → 7.24 + 0.00257 ≈ 7.2426.

So 1463/202 = 7.2426, so x=7.2426. So 7.2426%? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the units because 1.463 is in decimal, but 2.02 is in the denominator. So 1.463 divided by 2.02 is 0.7243, which is 72.43%.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting 0.7243, which is 72.43% for a, and 27.57% for b.

Looking at the options, option C is 72.42% and 27.58%, which is very close. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute 72.43% of 209.64 and 27.57% of 211.66.

Compute 72.43% of 209.64: 0.7243 * 209.64.

0.7 * 209.64 = 146.748. 0.0243 *209.64 ≈ 5.114. So total ≈ 146.748 +5.114= 151.862 amu.

27.57% of 211.66: 0.2757 *211.66 ≈ 2757 * 211.66 → wait, no. Let me compute 0.2757 *211.66.

0.2 *211.66 =42.332. 0.0757 *211.66 ≈ Let's compute 0.07 *211.66=14.8162. 0.0057 *211.66≈ 1.205. So total 14.8162 +1.205=16.021. So 42.332 +16.021=58.353 amu.

Adding the two contributions: 151.862 +58.353=210.215 amu. 

Wait, the atomic weight given is 210.197 amu. So 210.215 is a bit higher. Hmm. Did I make an error in calculation? Or perhaps my approximation led to it being a little off.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Let me compute the exact value.

Compute (0.7243 * 209.64) + (0.2757 *211.66).

Compute 0.7243 *209.64.

Calculate 209.64 *0.7 = 146.748. 209.64 *0.0243 = ?

0.02 *209.64=4.1928. 0.0043*209.64=0.899. So 4.1928 + 0.899=5.0918. So 0.7243*209.64=146.748 +5.0918=151.8398 amu.

Now 0.2757 *211.66. Let's compute 211.66 *0.2=42.332. 211.66 *0.0757= ?

Hmm, 211.66 *0.07 =14.8162. 211.66 *0.0057=1.205. So total 14.8162 +1.205=16.0212. 

So 42.332+16.0212=58.3532 amu.

Adding them: 151.8398 +58.3532=210.193 amu. Which is very close to 210.197. So it's accurate.

So the relative abundances are approximately 72.43% and 27.57%. Looking back at the options, option C is 72.42% and 27.58%, which is very close. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the relative abundances of the two isotopes (^210X and ^212X) of element X, we use the weighted average formula for atomic weight:

\[
\text{Atomic weight} = (a \cdot \text{mass of } ^{210}X) + (b \cdot \text{mass of } ^{212}X)
\]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are the relative abundances of the isotopes, and \( a + b = 1 \). Substituting the given values:

\[
210.197 = a \cdot 209.64 + (1 - a) \cdot 211.66
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
210.197 = 209.64a + 211.66 - 211.66a
\]

\[
210.197 = 209.64a - 211.66a + 211.66
\]

\[
210.197 = -2.02a + 211.66
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( a \):

\[
-2.02a = 210.197 - 211.66
\]

\[
-2.02a = -1.463
\]

\[
a = \frac{-1.463}{-2.02} \approx 0.7243 \, (\text{or } 72.43\%)
\]

Since \( a + b = 1 \), the abundance of the second isotope is:

\[
b = 1 - a = 1 - 0.7243 = 0.2757 \, (\text{or } 27.57\%)
\]

These abundances match the relative abundances in option **C**. To confirm, the calculations were repeated with precise values, and the result was consistent. The relative abundances are:

- \( ^{210}X \): \( 72.42\% \)
- \( ^{212}X \): \( 27.58\% \)

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: C**
