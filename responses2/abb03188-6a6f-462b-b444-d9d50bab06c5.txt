The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Suppose that 100 separate firms were tested to determine how many of them "beat the market" using a Jensen-type regression, and it is found that 3 fund managers significantly do so. Does this suggest prima facie evidence for stock market inefficiency?

Options:

A: The results would be different if a different type of regression was used
B: This suggests evidence for stock market efficiency, not inefficiency
C: Yes
D: In order to answer this question, you would need to test every fund manager trading in that market
E: There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.
F: No
G: The results are inconclusive without knowing the performance of the market as a whole
H: It's impossible to draw conclusions based on the performance of only 100 firms
I: This indicates that the majority of fund managers do not significantly beat the market
J: This suggests that only a small percentage of fund managers can beat the market

Okay, so I've got this question about stock market inefficiency and Jensen-type regressions. Let me try to break it down. 

The question says that 100 separate firms were tested, and 3 fund managers "significantly beat the market" using a Jensen-type regression. I remember that Jensen's alpha measures the excess return of a portfolio over the return predicted by the market model. A significant positive alpha indicates that the portfolio outperforms the market, which is a sign of inefficiency.

Wait, but the question is about whether this suggests prima facie evidence for stock market inefficiency. Prima facie means "presupposing" or "in the first place." So, if we have significant Jensen alpha, that suggests the market is inefficient because it's doing better than expected. 

So, the 3 fund managers doing better than the market would indicate inefficiency. But wait, the question is about the market inefficiency. So if these fund managers are beating the market, that's inefficiency. So the answer would be that this suggests evidence for inefficiency. 

Looking at the options. Option B says this suggests evidence for market efficiency, which doesn't make sense. Option A says the results would be different with a different regression. Hmm, but the question is about what the 3 fund managers do. So A might be a distractor. 

Option C says yes, which would be correct if the 3 fund managers indeed beat the market. But does the question provide enough info? It says "3 fund managers significantly do so." So that's a solid case. 

Option E says we don't know because only 100 firms are tested. Well, 100 is a decent sample, but it's not infinitely large. So without more data, it's not conclusive. But the question is about whether this suggests prima facie evidence, so even if more data isn't available, we can say this is evidence.

Wait, but wait another thought. In the context of market efficiency, if the market is efficient, then all fundamental factors are already reflected in the returns. So if fund managers beat the market, that would indicate that the market is not efficient. That's the opposite of what we're looking for. 

So if 3 fund managers are performing better than expected (as the market predicts), that is inefficiency. So the answer should be B: this suggests evidence for market inefficiency. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes, if a group of funds significantly outperforms, it might indicate that the market is not efficient. Because if the market is efficient, then all the fundamental factors are already priced in, so shouldn't all fund managers be expected to perform similarly? Or maybe not? I'm a bit fuzzy on that point. Oh wait, Jensenâ€™s alpha is about the total excess return, not just the firm-specific returns. So if a fund manager's alpha is significant, that means their performance is better than what the market would predict, which is an indication of inefficiency. 

So, if 3 fund managers have significant Jensen alphas, that suggests they are outperforming the market, which is inefficiency. So option B would be correct. 

Looking at the options again: 
- A: Different regression might lead to different results, but the question is whether the 3 fund managers are beating the market, not the method. So A is incorrect. 
- B: Yes, because the fund managers are beating the market, which is inefficiency. 
- C: Yes, but only if 3 is a significant number. But the question says 3, which is a small number. Not sure if that's enough. But the answer depends on whether 3 is enough. The question says "3 fund managers significantly do so." So B would be the correct choice. 

Other options: E says insufficient info, but 100 firms are tested, so that's enough. D and others don't fit. So the correct answer should be B.

The question examines whether the performance of 3 fund managers, who significantly outperform the market using a Jensen-type regression, suggests prima facie evidence for stock market inefficiency. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The question focuses on fund managers beating the market, not regression type.
- **Option B**: Correct. Significant Jensen alphas indicate inefficiency, as it suggests the market is not reflecting all fundamentals.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While 3 fund managers beating the market is strong evidence, the sample size (100 firms) is sufficient but not conclusive.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The question doesn't require testing every fund manager.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. 100 firms provide enough data for reasonable conclusions.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The question provides sufficient evidence.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Inference about market performance is needed.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Sample size doesn't preclude conclusions.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The question doesn't suggest majority performance.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The evidence is strong, not weak.

**Answer: B**
