Okay, so I've got this question about the privatization of companies and what happened as per Mulholland's 1998 argument. Hmm, I remember that privatization is when state-owned companies are sold to private individuals or corporations. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question asks what Mulholland argued changed the relationship between companies and managers. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

Let me recall. In 1998, an economic expert named Mulholland wrote a paper. He thought that privatization made the roles of managers change. But what did he specifically say?

Wait, I think he argued that managers weren't as accountable to shareholders as they were before. Because when firms are privatized, the managers might not have the same level of control as they did before. Like, before, managers were more directly tied to the company's performance, but after privatization, the focus shifts to the shareholders. So, the managers might not have the same accountability because the company is now running on their behalf or perhaps they're just workers for the state.

Looking at the options, option H says "Managers became less accountable to shareholders." That sounds like what Mulholland was suggesting. So H would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me think again. He probably thought that managers weren't as responsible anymore because the state runs the company. So the managers don't have the same stake in the company's success. So their accountability is reduced because it's now the state's responsibility. That would make H correct.

What about other options? Option A says the relationship between companies and managers became more formalized. But I think that was a different time. I think that might have been a different concept, maybe more about the structure of management. So A might not be correct.

Option B: ownership moved from small shareholders to senior managers. That doesn't sound right. Privatization usually moves ownership from the state to the private sector, not from small shareholders to managers. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: State had greater control. No, that's the opposite. Privatization is about state to private, so state control decreases. C is wrong.

Option D: Managers less accountable. That's what I was thinking. So D is incorrect.

Option E: More small shareholders. That doesn't seem right. Privatization is about company restructuring, not necessarily increasing the number of shareholders. E is wrong.

Option F: Fewer employees. That's possible, but not what Mulholland specifically said. He focused on the management structure, not just the number of employees.

Option G: Details in daily worksheets. I don't recall anything about this in his argument. It's more about management structure than about worksheets.

Option J: Managers' roles unchanged. No, that's contrary to what he argued. He thought the managers' accountability was reduced.

So the correct answer is H: managers became less accountable.

The correct answer is **H: managers became less accountable to shareholders**. This aligns with Mulholland's argument that privatization reduced managers' accountability, shifting focus to shareholders' responsibility. 

Answer: H
