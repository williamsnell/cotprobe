Question:

According to Krause and Williams, what agenda would most likely attract scholars to the 'broad church' of security studies?

Options:

A: To question the referent object, to question the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state, and to change the way in which security is studied.
B: To address security from a positivist perspective, challenging the dominance of traditional security paradigms, and shifting academic attention to the individual as a referent point.
C: To question the dominance of liberalism and realism in the international system, to apply critical knowledge to the security dilemma faced by states and to redress the power imbalances that lead to intra-state conflict.
D: To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about security studies and the agenda that would attract scholars to the 'broad church.' I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question refers to Krause and Williams, so I need to remember what their approach is. From what I recall, Krause and Williams are into critical theory and academic approaches, especially in the context of security studies. Their work often emphasizes questioning and redefining traditional concepts.

The options are A, B, C, D. So I need to figure out which option aligns with their agenda.

Option A says: "To question the referent object, to question the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state, and to change the way in which security is studied." Hmm, this seems to focus on the referent object, questioning security as a state power. It also mentions changing the study methods, which sounds like critical theory. So this aligns with Krause and Williams, who tend to question dominant paradigms and challenge power structures.

Option B: "To address security from a positivist perspective, challenging the dominance of traditional security paradigms, and shifting academic attention to the individual as a referent point." Wait, B starts with a positivist approach. Krause and Williams, I think, don't take a positivist stance. They're more about questioning traditional models, not necessarily adopting a new perspective. Plus, shifting academic attention to the individual as referent... that might be more like a traditional approach, as in traditional security studies focus on the state and traditional models.

Option C: "To question the dominance of liberalism and realism in the international system, to apply critical knowledge to the security dilemma faced by states and to redress the power imbalances that lead to intra-state conflict." This one talks about international system dynamics, using critical knowledge and addressing power imbalances. That's a bit more about state security and international relations, which Krause and Williams might not focus on as much. They might be more interested in the theoretical aspects rather than the specifics of state security.

Option D: "To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects." This sounds like Krause and Williams would be interested in a more general approach, possibly expanding the scope of security studies. They might not be pushing for a specific referent object but rather a more inclusive or diverse approach.

So, putting it together, Krause and Williams are known for their work in critical theory, questioning dominant concepts, and challenging traditional paradigms. They might focus more on redefining what security is and how it's studied, rather than just addressing specific issues with positivism.

Looking back, option A talks about questioning the referent object (which is a key concept in Krause), the traditional security as paramount to the state, and changes in how security is studied. That seems in line with their approach of challenging established models.

Option D says to expand the school, which could be part of it. But the primary focus seems to be on questioning rather than expanding the scope.

So between A and D. D seems to be more about general expansion, while A is about specific changes. Krause and Williams might be more interested in redefining the study methods and questioning the referent object, making A the correct answer.

The correct answer is A.
