Okay, so I have this linear algebra problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: Let V be the real vector space of all real 2x3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4x1 column vectors. T is a linear transformation from V onto W. We need to find the dimension of the kernel of T, which is the kernel of T, right?

Wait, the kernel of T is the set of all vectors v in V such that T(v) is in W. But wait, no, actually, T is a linear transformation from V to W, and it's onto, meaning that the image of T is W. The kernel is the set of vectors v in V that map to the zero vector in W. So, the kernel is a subspace of V.

Hmm. I remember the Rank-Nullity Theorem. Oh right, that's the one. It states that the dimension of the domain (which is V here) is equal to the dimension of the kernel plus the dimension of the image (which is W here). So, dim(V) = dim(ker T) + dim(im T).

Wait, but W is the codomain, and since T is onto, the image is W itself. So, dim(im T) is equal to dim(W). But wait, what's the dimension of V and W?

Let's think. V is the space of 2x3 real matrices. How many elements are in a 2x3 matrix? 2 rows and 3 columns, so 6 elements. So, each matrix is a vector in R^6. So, V is a 6-dimensional real vector space.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the dimension of V is the number of entries, which is 2 rows * 3 columns = 6. So dim(V) is 6. So, applying the Rank-Nullity Theorem, dim(V) = dim(ker T) + dim(im T). 

But wait, T is onto, so the image of T is W. What is the dimension of W? W is the space of 4x1 column vectors. So, that's R^4. Hence, dim(W) is 4. So dim(im T) is 4.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says that T is a linear transformation from V onto W. So, that would mean that the image is W, which has dimension 4. So, according to the Rank-Nullity Theorem, 6 (dim V) = dim(ker T) + 4 (dim im T). So, solving for dim(ker T): 6 -4 = 2. So dim(ker T) is 2. Therefore, the answer should be E, which is 2.

But wait, let me double-check. Let me make sure I didn't get any of the dimensions wrong.

V is 2x3 matrices, so each matrix is a vector in R^6. So dim V is 6.

W is 4x1 column vectors, so that's R^4. So dim W is 4.

Since T is onto, the image of T is W, so dim im T is 4.

Using Rank-Nullity: 6 = dim(ker T) + 4 â†’ dim(ker T) = 2.

Yes, that seems right. So the kernel's dimension is 2, which is option E.

To solve the problem, we start by applying the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which states that for a linear transformation \( T: V \rightarrow W \), the dimension of the domain \( V \) is equal to the sum of the dimension of the kernel of \( T \) and the dimension of the image of \( T \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[
\dim(V) = \dim(\ker T) + \dim(\operatorname{im}(T))
\]

Here, \( V \) is the space of all real \( 2 \times 3 \) matrices, which has dimension \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \). \( W \), being the space of all real \( 4 \times 1 \) column vectors, has dimension \( 4 \).

Since \( T \) is a linear transformation from \( V \) onto \( W \), the image of \( T \) is \( W \), so \( \dim(\operatorname{im}(T)) = 4 \).

Substituting into the Rank-Nullity Theorem:

\[
6 = \dim(\ker T) + 4
\]

Solving for \( \dim(\ker T) \):

\[
\dim(\ker T) = 6 - 4 = 2
\]

Thus, the dimension of the kernel of \( T \) is 2. The correct answer is E.
