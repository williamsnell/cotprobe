Okay, so I've got this equation: x⁴ + 2x³ + x = 10. I'm supposed to find the sum of its four roots using the Newton-Raphson method. Wait, but the question is about the sum of the roots. Hmm, Newton-Raphson is usually for finding roots numerically, right? Like, it's an iterative method. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, no, wait, the question says "using the Newton-Raphson method." That doesn't directly give me the sum. Hmm, perhaps I need to find the sum of the roots without using the method, and then see which option matches. Alternatively, maybe there's a connection between the equation and the sum of roots.

Wait, the equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + x -10 =0. So, it's a quartic equation. The sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formula. For a quartic equation of the form x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0, the sum of roots is -a. So in this case, a is 2, so the sum should be -2. Looking at the options, option E is -2.0. But wait, the question is about using the Newton-Raphson method. Hmm, that's confusing because Newton-Raphson is a method, not a formula for the sum. Oh wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the options are given because the sum is -2, and the question is phrased as what's the sum, so the correct answer is E, which is -2.0. Because the question seems to be testing the knowledge of Vieta's formula, not necessarily the Newton-Raphson method. So the answer should be E.

The equation is \( x^4 + 2x^3 + x - 10 = 0 \). Using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is \( -a \), where \( a = 2 \), so the sum is \( -2 \).

Answer: E: -2.0
