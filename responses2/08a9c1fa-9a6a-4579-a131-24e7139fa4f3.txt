Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about business regulation and private regulation's causes. Let's see, I need to figure out the right answer. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.

The question is about private regulation's causes. The options are about what factors encourage or motivate private regulation. The structure of the sentence is: "The rise in business led, private regulation can be attributed to: encouragement of a _______ approach from industry, _________ and _______ achievement of objectives."

So, I need to match the blanks with the correct phrases. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Faster
Option B: Reactive, Cost effectiveness, Slower
Option C: Faster, Cost effectiveness, Slower
Option D: Proactive, Heightened costs, Faster
Option E: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Slower
Option F: Proactive, Cost ineffectiveness, Slower
Option G: Reactive, Heightened costs, Faster
Option H: Faster, Cost ineffectiveness, Faster
Option I: Reactive, Cost ineffectiveness, Faster
Option J: Faster, Heightened costs, Slower

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I remember that private regulation can be either proactive or reactive. Proactive means encouraging the industry to act in a certain way, like promoting efficiency or innovation. Reactive would be when the industry reacts to regulation, like reacting to the rules.

Now, for the second part, the achievements. I think cost effectiveness is a good fit. Private regulation often leads to cost savings and efficiency. But I'm not sure about the other parts.

Looking at the options again, let's consider each part. The first blank: Proactive or Reactive? I think proactive because it involves encouraging the industry to act in a certain way, like promoting efficiency. So options A, D, E, F, H, J are proactive. B, C, G, I are reactive.

Next, the second part: what's the second part of the sentence? It says "and_________ achievement of objectives." The options for the second part are cost effectiveness, cost ineffectiveness, heightened costs, slower.

Wait, heightened costs might mean more costs, which doesn't fit. Cost ineffectiveness would be saying the costs aren't effective. Slower would mean taking longer, which might be the opposite of promoting efficiency. So maybe the second part refers to cost effectiveness because it's about achieving goals with cost savings.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. Proactive regulation encourages the industry to act in a way that benefits the business. So the first blank is correct. For the second part, what's the consequence? Achieving objectivesâ€”efficiency, cost savings, which are good. So the second part is cost effectiveness.

Wait, but the options have cost ineffectiveness as one of them. Cost ineffectiveness sounds like the opposite. So probably not that. So the second part is cost effectiveness, and the third part is the third word in the options. 

Looking at the third part of the options. The options are faster and slower. The sentence says "and_________ achievement of objectives." So the third part is the third word in the sentence.

Wait, let's think about the structure again: The sentence is about private regulation being attributed to encouraging a certain approach, achieving certain costs, and achieving certain objectives. So the third part is the third word of the sentence in the options.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think of the possible structures. The sentence is structured as [encouragement] [approach] [achieve] [objectives].

Wait, maybe the third part refers to the time aspect. Achieving objectives faster or slower. If the regulation is encouraging efficiency, perhaps the objectives are achieved faster because they're more efficient.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of what each option says:

Option A: Proactive, Cost effective, Faster.

So that would mean: encouraging a proactive approach (like promoting efficiency), achieving objectives with cost effectiveness (saving costs), and achieving faster.

Option E: Proactive, Cost effective, Slower. So slower achievement. Hmm.

But I think that's not correct. Achieving objectives faster makes sense because efficiency would lead to faster outcomes.

Wait, perhaps the third part is about whether it's quicker or slower. So I think that the third part is 'faster'.

So, the options that have Proactive as the first, Cost effective as the second, and faster as the third, are A, E, I, J.

Looking at the options again:

A: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Faster
E: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Slower
J: Faster, Heightened costs, Slower

Wait, J says the first part is 'faster', which is incorrect because the first part should be Proactive, not Faster.

So that leaves options A, E, and J. But J is 'faster' first, which can't be right. So A and E are the only options left.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the second part. Let me think again. The second part is "and_________ achievement of objectives." So it's saying, after achieving a certain approach, they also achieve something else.

If the approach is proactive, perhaps the second part is about cost effectiveness because it's about saving costs, which leads to achieving objectives more effectively.

So, the second part would be cost effective.

So that brings us to option A: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Faster.

Alternatively, option E is Proactive, Cost effective, Slower. But slower would mean the objectives take longer, which doesn't fit with efficient approaches.

Therefore, I think the correct option is A: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Faster.

The question asks for the factors motivating private regulation, with the sentence structure indicating three parts: the first is proactive or reactive, the second is about cost effectiveness, and the third is about achieving objectives faster or slower. 

1. **Proactive or Reactive**: Private regulation is generally proactive, as it encourages industry actions for efficiency and innovation.
2. **Cost Effectiveness**: Achieving cost effectiveness aligns with the goal of efficiency, which is the benefit of proactive regulation.
3. **Achieving Faster**: Proactive regulation often leads to faster outcomes due to efficiency, making "faster" the correct choice.

Thus, the correct option is **A: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Faster**.

Answer: A
