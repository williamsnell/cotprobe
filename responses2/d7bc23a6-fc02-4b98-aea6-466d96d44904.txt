Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Johnson discounting a non-interest bearing draft. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on financial terms, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says he discounted a draft for $850 due in July 12 on July 1 at a discount rate of 5%. They want to know his proceeds, assuming a 365-day year. The options are all around $845 to $850, so it's a bit of a trade-off.

First, I remember that when you discount a bill, you're essentially giving a discount from the face value. But wait, this draft is non-interest bearing. Oh, right, so it doesn't pay interest. That means the discount would be based on the face value, not on the proceeds. So the proceeds would just be the amount he gets after subtracting the discount from the face value.

The formula for discount is usually (Face Value * Discount Rate * Time). But wait, the time is usually expressed in days. So I need to calculate how many days are between July 1 and July 12. Let's see, from July 1 to July 12 is 11 days? Wait, no: from July 1 to July 12 is 12 days because you include both the start and end dates. Wait, no. Wait, the period is from July 1 to July 12, which is 11 days in between, but including both days, it's 12 days. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if you have a time period of T days, for the simple interest calculation, I think it's typically (number of days) divided by 365. So for the time factor, it's 12 / 365.

Wait, but let me think: the note is due on July 12, and the discount was given on July 1. So the time between July 1 and July 12 is 12 days? Or 11 days? Because from July 1 to July 12 is 11 days after July 1, making it 12 days in total (including the starting day). Or is it 11 days? Because if you count July 1 as the starting date, then the next day is July 2, and so on until July 12. That would be 11 days in between. Wait, but wait: the formula is usually (days / 365) multiplied by the discount rate. So for this problem, the time is 11 days (from July 1 to July 12, inclusive? No, wait, no. The time period is from the discounting date to the due date, so from day 1 to day 12, which is 11 days if you're counting the end date as day 12. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think about it: from July 1 (day 0) to July 12 is 12 days. So the time factor is 12 / 365.

Wait, but sometimes when calculating discount, the number of days is considered as the number of days after the discount date. For example, if the note is due on day X, and you discount it on day Y, the time is (X - Y) days. So from July 1 to July 12, that's 12 -1 = 11 days. So the time factor is 11/365.

Wait, let me think. Suppose you have a note due in 30 days, and you discount it on day 10. So the discount period is 20 days. But wait, no, the time is 30 days, so from day 10 to day 30 is 20 days. So the formula uses the number of days after the discounting date.

Wait, I think I need to confirm this. The formula for discount is (Face Value * Rate * Time). The Time is the number of days between the discounting date and the due date, divided by 365. So in this case, the discounting date is July 1, due date is July 12. So the number of days is 12 -1 = 11 days. Or wait, no, wait: from July 1 to July 12 is 12 days in total (including both dates). So the time would be 12 days. So the formula would be: discount = 850 * 0.05 * (12/365).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Another way to think: if you have a note due in 12 days, and you discount it on day 1, the time is 12 days. So the formula uses the number of days as the time.

Let me look it up mentally: For simple interest, the formula is Interest = Principal × Rate × Time. Time is the number of days divided by 365. So if the note is due in 12 days, and you discount it on day 1, the time is 12 days. So the discount amount is 850 * 0.05 * (12/365).

Wait, but wait: the discounting is at the rate of 5%, so the discount is 5% of the face value. So discount = Face Value × (Discount Rate). So 850 × 0.05 = 42.5. But that's the simple interest. Because the note is non-interest bearing, this interest is given upfront, so the proceeds are Face Value minus discount.

Wait, but wait, the discount is based on the face value, so the proceeds would be 850 - (850 × 0.05) = 850 -42.5 = 807.5. But that's not matching any of the options. So clearly, I'm missing something.

Wait, no. I think I made a mistake because perhaps the time is not 12 days. Because the note is due on July 12, and the discount is given on July 1. So the time between those dates is 12 days, but how is it calculated? Let me think: the time from July 1 to July 12 is 11 days (since from day 1 to day 12 is 11 days after the first day). Wait, no, wait. If you count day 1 as the discount date and day 12 as the due date, the number of days between them is 11 days (days 2 to 12). Or wait, no, between day 1 and day 12, the period is 12 days (including both days). So that's 12 days.

Wait, but I've heard that the discount is calculated based on the number of days between the discount date and the due date. So if you pay on day X, the time is (X - discount date +1) days. Wait, no, I think the standard is to count the number of days from the discount date to the due date, excluding the discount date. So for example, if you have a note due on day 10 and you discount it on day 5, the time is 5 days (days 6-10). So in this problem, discounting on day 1, due on day 12: time is 12 -1 = 11 days. Wait, but no, that would make the time 11 days. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact number of days. Let me think: July 1 to July 12 is 12 days. So the time is 12 days. So the discount is 850 × 0.05 × (12/365).

Wait, let's compute that: 850 * 0.05 is 42.5. 42.5 * (12/365) = 42.5 * 0.0328767 ≈ 42.5 × 0.032877 ≈ 1.3959.

So the discount is approximately $1.3959. So proceeds would be 850 - 1.3959 ≈ $848.604, which is approximately $848.60. Looking at the options, option C is $848.72, and option G is $847.72. But wait, none of these options is $848.60. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the discount is calculated differently. Let's think again. The problem says it's a non-interest bearing draft. So the discount is based on the face value, but the time is from the discounting date to the due date. So the time is 11 days (from July 1 to July 12 is 12 days, but the time between is 11 days because you start counting from the next day after the discount date. Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, let's think about the actual calculation. The formula for the proceeds when you discount a bill is: Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value × Discount Rate × Time). But the time here is the number of days from the discount date to the due date.

Wait, but the problem says "discounted a non-interest bearing draft for $850 due July 12 on July 1". So that's a 12-day note, but the discount is given 1 day before the due date. So the time is 11 days because the discount is on day 1, and the due date is day 12. So time is 11 days.

Wait, no. If the note is due on July 12, and the discount is given on July 1, then the time is 11 days. Because from July 1 to July 12 is 12 days, but the discount is at the end of day 1, so the time is 11 days.

So the discount amount is 850 × 0.05 × (11/365). Let's compute that.

0.05 × 850 = 42.5. 42.5 × (11/365) = 42.5 × 0.029863 ≈ 42.5 × 0.029863 ≈ 1.273.

So the discount is approximately $1.273. So proceeds = 850 - 1.273 = 848.727, which is about $848.73. Looking at the options, option C is $848.72, which is very close. Wait, but wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the time is 12 days because the discount is for 12 days.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Another way: the formula for the discount is (Face Value × Rate × Time), but the time is in days. So the time here is 11 days (from July 1 to July 12, exclusive?), or 12 days (including both dates). I think it's 11 days because the time is from the discount date to the due date, which would be 11 days.

Wait, let me think: if you have a note due on day 12, and you discount it on day 1, the time is 11 days. Because day 1 to day 12 is 12 days in total, but the time between the discounting date and due date is 11 days. So the discount is 850 × 0.05 × (11/365).

Wait, let me recalculate that.

0.05 × 850 = 42.5. 42.5 × (11/365) is (42.5 *11)/365 = 467.5 /365 ≈ 1.274. So the discount is $1.274, so proceeds are 850 - 1.274 = 848.726, which is approximately $848.73. So in the options, the closest is option C: $848.72. Hmm, but why is option C $848.72 instead of $848.73? Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 11 days as 11/365, which is approximately 0.030137. So 0.05 *850 =42.5. 42.5 * 0.030137 = 1.278. So approximately $1.278 discount. Proceeds would be 848.722. Rounding to the nearest cent would be $848.72, so option C.

Wait, but the options are:

A: $850.28

B: $846.50

C: $848.72

D: $845.00

E: $850.00

F: $849.28

G: $847.72

H: $851.50

I: $847.00

J: $849.00

Wait, so option C is $848.72, which is about what I calculated. But why is there a difference? Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 11/365 = 0.0298630137.

So 0.05*850 =42.5. 42.5 * 0.0298630137 = let's compute it as 42.5 * 0.029863.

Compute 42.5 * 0.029863:

42.5 × 0.029863 = ?

Let me break it down:

42.5 *0.02 = 0.85

42.5 *0.009863 = ?

0.009863 is approximately 0.01, but let me compute it accurately.

0.01 *42.5 = 0.425. But since it's 0.009863, which is 0.9863% of 0.01.

So 42.5 * 0.9863% = 42.5 * 0.00009863 ≈ 0.004204.

Adding to 0.85: 0.85 + 0.004204 ≈ 0.854204.

So total discount is approx $0.8542. So 850 - 0.8542 = 849.1458. Wait, that's not matching earlier. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, perhaps I got the time calculation wrong. Let me think again: the note is due on July 12, and the discount is given on July 1. So the time between July 1 and July 12 is 12 days, but the discount period is 11 days. So the discount is 850 * 0.05 * (11/365).

Wait, so 11/365 is approximately 0.029863. 0.05×850=42.5. 42.5 × 0.029863 = let's see:

42.5 × 0.029863 = (42.5 × 0.03) - (42.5 × 0.000137) 

0.03 of 42.5 is 1.275. 0.000137 of 42.5 is approximately 0.0058925. So 1.275 - 0.0058925 = 1.2691075.

So the discount is about $1.2691. So proceeds would be 850 -1.2691 = $848.7309. Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $848.73. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: $848.72.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe the time is 12 days because it's the time from July 1 to July 12, inclusive. Let's try that.

So 12/365 = 0.0328767.

So discount is 850 × 0.05 × 0.0328767.

850 ×0.05 is 42.5. 42.5 × 0.0328767= approx 42.5 ×0.0328= 1.398. So 42.5 *0.0328767= let's compute:

0.0328767 ×42.5 = ?

0.03 ×42.5=1.275.

0.0028767 ×42.5 = approx 0.01225.

So total is 1.275 + 0.01225= 1.28725.

So discount is $1.28725, so proceeds would be 850 - 1.28725= 848.71275. Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $848.71. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the time is 12 days because the note is due on July 12, so the discount is given on the same date? No, I think that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the calculation is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the time is 12 days because the note is due on July 12, and the discount is given on July 1, which is the same as the due date. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should look at another approach. Let me use the formula:

Proceeds = Face Value × [1 - (Discount Rate × Time)]

Wait, no. The formula is Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value × Discount Rate × Time). So that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the time is calculated as the number of days after discounting, so for example, if the note is due on July 12, and the discount is given on July 1, then the number of days between the discount date and the due date is 12 days. So the time is 12 days.

So, discount is 850 ×0.05 × (12/365) = 850 ×0.05 =42.5. 42.5 × (12/365) = ?

12/365 = 0.0328767.

42.5 ×0.0328767 ≈ 1.3959.

So discount is $1.3959. Proceeds are 850 -1.3959=848.604, which is approximately $848.60. None of the options have that.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me consider the options again.

Option C is $848.72, which is about 848.72.

Option G is $847.72, which is about 847.72.

Wait, perhaps the time is not 11 days but 12 days, so the discount is 850 ×0.05 × (12/365) = 850 × 0.05 ×0.0328767.

Which is 850 × 0.001643835 = 1.40099.

So discount is approximately 1.4010. Proceeds would be 850 -1.4010=848.599. So approximately $848.60. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 11/365 more accurately.

11/365 = 0.0298630137.

So 0.05 ×850 =42.5.

42.5 ×0.0298630137.

Let me compute this as 42.5 ×0.0298630137.

42.5 ×0.0298630137 = let me compute 42.5 ×0.029863.

Wait, 0.029863 ×42.5 = ?

0.029863 ×40 =1.19452.

0.029863 ×2.5 =0.0746575.

Adding: 1.19452 +0.0746575 =1.2691775.

So the discount is approximately $1.2691775, which is about $1.26918.

Thus, proceeds are 850 -1.26918=848.73082, which is approximately $848.73.

But the options don't have an option for $848.73. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me think again: the time is from the discount date to the due date, which is 12 days, but the discount is given on the same day as the due date? No, that's impossible.

Wait, another way: perhaps the time is 11 days because the discount is given on the same day as the note's due date. No, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I have to calculate it as 12 days, but that would make the proceeds around $848.73, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the discount as 850 ×0.05 × (12/365). Let me compute this exactly.

850 ×0.05 =42.5.

42.5 × (12/365) =42.5 × (0.0328767).

Compute 42.5 ×0.0328767:

42.5 ×0.0328767 = let's compute 42.5 ×0.03 =1.275.

42.5 ×0.0028767 = 42.5 ×0.002=0.085, 42.5 ×0.0008767≈0.03729.

So 0.085 +0.03729=0.12229.

So total discount is 1.275 +0.12229=1.39729.

So discount is $1.39729. So proceeds are 850 -1.39729=848.60271. So approximately $848.60.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the time is 12 days, but discount is given on day 1, so the time is 11 days. Let's compute that.

850 ×0.05 × (11/365) =850 ×0.05=42.5. 42.5 ×(11/365)=42.5 ×0.029863= approx 1.273.

Proceeds: 850 -1.273=848.727. So approximately $848.73. But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the time is 12 days, but the discount is given on day 1, so the discount is 850 ×0.05 × (12/365) =850 ×0.05=42.5 ×0.0328767=1.397. So proceeds are 850 -1.397=848.603. Again, not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think that the time is 12 days because the note is due on July 12, and the discount is given on July 1, which is the same day as the note's due date minus one day. So the time is 12 days.

So discount is 850 ×0.05 × (12/365) = as above, about $1.397, so proceeds are $848.60.

But looking at the options, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated as the face value minus (face value × rate × time). So 850 - (850 ×5% × time). Let me compute that.

850 ×5% =42.5. 42.5 × time = discount.

So time is 11 days.

So discount is 42.5 × (11/365)=42.5 ×0.029863≈1.273.

Proceeds: 850 -1.273=848.727. So approximately $848.73.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the time is 12 days, but the discount is given on day 1, which is the same as the due date minus one day. So the discount period is 12 days, but that would mean the time is 12 days. So discount is 42.5 × (12/365)=42.5 ×0.0328767≈1.397.

Proceeds: 850 -1.397=848.603. So approximately $848.60.

Again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 11/365 ×5% ×850 exactly.

11/365 =0.029863.

5% is 0.05.

So 0.05 ×0.029863=0.00149315.

Multiply by 850: 850 ×0.00149315=1.2686275.

So discount is $1.2686, so proceeds are 850 -1.2686=848.7314, which is approximately $848.73.

Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the time as 12 days, but the discount is given on day 1, which is the same as the due date minus one day, so the discount is for 12 days. So discount is 850 ×5% × (12/365) =850 ×0.05=42.5 × (12/365)=42.5 ×0.0328767≈1.397.

Proceeds: 850 -1.397=848.603. So $848.60.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but I have to choose the closest one.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is $848.72, which is very close to $848.73. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the discount.

Wait, let me compute 11/365 ×5% ×850.

11/365 =0.029863.

0.05 ×0.029863 =0.00149315.

Multiply by 850: 850 ×0.00149315 =1.2691775.

So discount is $1.2691775, so proceeds are 850 -1.2691775 =848.7308225, which is approximately $848.73.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another way: compute the time as the number of days between the discount and due dates, which is 11 days.

So discount is 850 ×5% ×11/365.

Which is 850 ×0.05=42.5. 42.5 ×11=467.5. 467.5 /365 = 1.273.

Proceeds: 850 -1.273=848.727, which is approximately $848.73.

Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: $848.72, but I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G: $847.72, which would be 850 - 2.28. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach or perhaps check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as follows:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value × Rate × Time).

So,

Proceeds = 850 - (850 × 5% × Time).

Time is 11 days.

So,

Proceeds =850 - (850 ×0.05 × (11/365)).

Compute 850 ×0.05=42.5.

42.5 × (11/365)=42.5 ×0.029863≈1.273.

So,

Proceeds=850-1.273=848.727.

So, approximately $848.73.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the time is 12 days, but the discount is given on the same day as the due date. So the time is 12 days.

So,

Proceeds =850 - (850 ×5% ×12/365).

850 ×0.05=42.5.

42.5 ×12=510.

510 /365 ≈1.402.

So,

Proceeds=850 -1.402=848.598≈$848.60.

Hmm, but again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the time is 12 days, but the discount is given on the same day as the due date. So the time is 12 days.

So,

Proceeds=850 - (850 ×5% ×12/365)=850 - (42.5 ×12/365)=850 - (510/365)=850 -1.402=848.598.

So approximately $848.60.

Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: $848.72, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 11/365 ×5% ×850.

11/365 =0.029863.

5% is 0.05.

0.05 ×0.029863 =0.00149315.

850 ×0.00149315=1.2691775.

So, 850 -1.2691775=848.7308225.

So approximately $848.73.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: $848.72, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

Proceeds = Face Value × (1 - (Discount Rate × Time)).

So,

Proceeds =850 × (1 - (0.05 × Time)).

If Time is 11 days,

0.05 ×11=0.55.

So,

Proceeds=850 × (1 -0.55)=850 ×0.45=382.5.

Wait, that can't be right because 850 ×0.45 is 382.5, which would imply that the proceeds are $382.50, which is way less than the face value.

Hmm, that approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula. Let me think again.

The correct formula for proceeds is:

Proceeds = Face Value × (1 - (Discount Rate × Time)).

So, if Time is 11 days,

Proceeds =850 ×(1 - (0.05 ×11)).

So,

0.05 ×11=0.55.

1 -0.55=0.45.

So,

Proceeds=850 ×0.45=382.5.

Which is incorrect because 850 - (850 ×5% ×11/365)=848.73.

So that approach is wrong.

Wait, another way: perhaps the time is 12 days, so 850 ×0.05 ×12/365=?

0.05 ×12/365=0.05 ×0.0328767=0.001643835.

850 ×0.001643835=1.397.

So,

Proceeds=850 -1.397=848.603.

Again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: $848.72, but I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the discount as 850 ×5% × (12/365) =850 ×0.05 ×0.0328767≈850 ×0.001643835≈1.401.

Proceeds=850 -1.401=848.599≈$848.60.

Which again, no option matches.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the time is 12 days, but the discount is given on the same day as the due date, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the time is 12 days, but the discount is given on the same day as the due date, which is impossible. So, perhaps, the correct answer is option C: $848.72.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct answer is option C: $848.72.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think I should proceed with option C as the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is option C: $848.72.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - A non-interest-bearing draft is given on July 1, and the due date is July 12.
   - The face value is $850, and the discount rate is 5%.

2. **Calculate the Discount:**
   - **Face Value:** $850
   - **Discount Rate:** 5% (0.05)
   - **Time:** 11 days (from July 1 to July 12, exclusive of the due date)
   - **Discount Calculation:**
     \[
     \text{Discount} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Discount Rate} \times \frac{\text{Time}}{365}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 850 \times 0.05 \times \frac{11}{365}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 850 \times 0.05 \times 0.029863
     \]
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 850 \times 0.00149315
     \]
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 1.2691775
     \]

3. **Calculate the Proceeds:**
   - **Proceeds = Face Value - Discount**
     \[
     \text{Proceeds} = 850 - 1.2691775
     \]
     \[
     \text{Proceeds} = 848.7308225
     \]
   - **Rounded to Two Decimal Places:** $848.73

4. **Compare with Options:**
   - The closest option to $848.73 is option C: $848.72.

**Final Answer:**

C) $848.72
