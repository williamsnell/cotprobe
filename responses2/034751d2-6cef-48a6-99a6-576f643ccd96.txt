Okay, so I've got this half-life problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question says that the half-life of a radioactive substance is 8 years, and I need to find out how long it will take for two-thirds of the substance to decay. Hmm, wait, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of a substance to decay. So, if something has a half-life of 8 years, then every 8 years, half of it decays. But the question isn't asking for the time it takes for half to decay; it's asking for when two-thirds of it has decayed. Oh wait, no, actually, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. It says, "how long will it take, in years, for two-thirds of the substance to decay?" So, the time it takes when two-thirds has decayed. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, maybe I'm reading it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, no, the question says, "how long will it take, in years, for two-thirds of the substance to decay?" No, wait, that can't be right because if two-thirds decay, that's a lot. Wait, perhaps it's the time it takes for two-thirds to decay, meaning the remaining substance is one-third. Because if two-thirds decay, then one-third remains. So, the time when 1/3 of the substance remains.

Ah, yes, that makes sense. So, when the substance is two-thirds gone, one-third remains. So, the problem can be rephrased as: how long does it take for one-third of the substance to decay, meaning one-third remains.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The half-life is 8 years. So, the substance decays by half each half-life. So, if I start with N0, after one half-life (8 years), it's N0/2. After two half-lives (16 years), it's N0/4, and so on.

But in this case, two-thirds have decayed. So, how much remains? Two-thirds decayed means one-third remains. So, 1/3 of the original amount is left.

So, the question is: how much time t is needed for the amount to reduce to 1/3 of its original amount.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up. The problem says, "two-thirds of the substance to decay". Wait, that could mean that 2/3 of the original amount decays. So, 1/3 remains. Or, perhaps, the time it takes until 2/3 has decayed, meaning 1/3 remains. Either way, it's the same.

So, the general formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where T is the half-life.

In this case, N = (1/3) N0. So,

(1/3) N0 = N0 * (1/2)^(t /8)

Divide both sides by N0,

1/3 = (1/2)^(t / 8)

I can take the logarithm of both sides to solve for t.

Taking natural logs:

ln(1/3) = (t / 8) * ln(1/2)

So, t = [ln(1/3) / ln(1/2)] *8

Compute that. Let me calculate the values step by step.

ln(1/3) is approximately ln(0.3333) ≈ -1.0986.

ln(1/2) is ln(0.5) ≈ -0.6931.

So, the ratio is (-1.0986) / (-0.6931) ≈ 1.58496.

Multiply by 8: 1.58496 *8 ≈ 12.68 years.

Looking at the options, choice C is 12.68.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to mix up half-lives. Another approach: the time needed for the amount to decrease to a fraction f of the original. The formula is t = T * log2(1/f).

So, in this case, f is 1/3. So, t = 8 * log2(3).

Log base 2 of 3 is approximately 1.58496, as I calculated before.

So, 8 *1.58496 ≈12.68 years. So, option C.

To determine how long it will take for two-thirds of a radioactive substance to decay, we start by noting that the half-life of the substance is 8 years. This means that every 8 years, half of the remaining substance decays. The question asks for the time it takes for two-thirds of the substance to decay, which translates to the remaining amount being one-third of the original.

Using the radioactive decay formula:

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{T}}
\]

where \( N \) is the remaining amount, \( N_0 \) is the initial amount, \( T \) is the half-life, and \( t \) is the time elapsed. We set \( N = \frac{1}{3}N_0 \) and solve for \( t \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{8}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{t}{8} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
t = 8 \cdot \frac{\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}
\]

Using \( \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx -0.6931 \):

\[
t = 8 \cdot \frac{-1.0986}{-0.6931} = 8 \cdot 1.58496 \approx 12.68 \, \text{years}
\]

Thus, the time required for two-thirds of the substance to decay is approximately 12.68 years, corresponding to option C.
