Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the average density of a rod. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that the linear density of the rod is given by 12 divided by the square root of (x + 1) kg per meter. The rod's length is 8 meters, and x is measured from one end. I need to find the average density.

Wait, linear density is mass per unit length. So, I'm looking for the total mass of the rod divided by its length, which would give me the average density because it's uniform along the rod.

But wait, the linear density isn't constant here; it's a function of x. So, I won't just take a simple average of the function over the entire length. Instead, I need to compute the total mass by integrating the density function from x=0 to x=8, and then divide that by 8 to get the average density.

Let me write down the linear density function. It's λ(x) = 12 / sqrt(x + 1) kg/m.

So, to find the total mass M, I integrate λ(x) dx from 0 to 8. That is,

M = ∫₀⁸ [12 / sqrt(x + 1)] dx.

Hmm, okay, let's compute that integral. The integral of 1/sqrt(u) du is 2 sqrt(u) + C, right? So, if I let u = x + 1, then du = dx.

So, changing variables, when x=0, u=1, and when x=8, u=9.

So, ∫ [12 / sqrt(u)] du from 1 to 9. That becomes 12 * [2 sqrt(u)] from 1 to 9.

Wait, because the integral of 1/sqrt(u) is 2 sqrt(u). So, 12 * 2 [sqrt(9) - sqrt(1)].

Let me compute that: 24 [3 - 1] = 24 * 2 = 48 kg. So, the total mass M is 48 kg? Wait, wait, wait.

Wait, no, wait. 12 times the integral of 1/sqrt(u) du from 1 to 9. So, the integral is 12 * 2 [sqrt(9) - sqrt(1)] = 24*(3-1) = 48 kg. So, M is 48 kg.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. The integral of 1/sqrt(x) dx is 2 sqrt(x) + C. So, yes, 12 * integral from 1 to 9 of 1/sqrt(u) du. So, 12 * [2 sqrt(u)] from 1 to 9 equals 24 [sqrt(9)-sqrt(1)] = 24*(3-1) = 48 kg. That seems right.

So, the total mass is 48 kg. The length is 8 m, so the average density is 48 kg / 8 m = 6 kg/m.

Looking at the options, option I is 6 kg/m. So, the answer should be I.

To find the average density of the rod, we first calculate the total mass by integrating the linear density function over the length of the rod. The linear density is given by:

\[
\lambda(x) = \frac{12}{\sqrt{x + 1}} \, \text{kg/m}.
\]

The total mass \( M \) is:

\[
M = \int_0^8 \frac{12}{\sqrt{x + 1}} \, dx.
\]

Let \( u = x + 1 \), so \( du = dx \). Changing the limits accordingly, when \( x = 0 \), \( u = 1 \), and when \( x = 8 \), \( u = 9 \). The integral becomes:

\[
M = 12 \int_1^9 \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \, du = 12 \cdot 2 \left[ \sqrt{u} \right]_1^9 = 24 \cdot (3 - 1) = 48 \, \text{kg}.
\]

The average density is the total mass divided by the length:

\[
\text{Average density} = \frac{M}{8} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \, \text{kg/m}.
\]

The correct answer is I: \( 6 \, \text{kg/m} \).
