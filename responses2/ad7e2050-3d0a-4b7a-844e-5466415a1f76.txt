Okay, so Bob is rolling a die each morning, right? And the question is about finding the expected number of times he rolls the die in a non-leap year. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem correctly. Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. Depending on what he rolls, he either eats sweetened or unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened. If it's a prime number, unsweetened. And if he rolls a 1, he rolls again. So each morning, the process is: roll the die; if it's 1, roll again; otherwise, stop.

The key here is to find the expected number of rolls per day. Once we have that, we can multiply it by 365 to get the total expected rolls for the year.

So the first thing is to figure out the expected number of rolls Bob makes each day.

Let me think about the probabilities involved. A six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6. Let's categorize each number as either composite, prime, or neither (which is 1 in this case).

Composite numbers are numbers greater than 1 that aren't primes. So 4 and 6 are composite. Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5. 1 is neither.

So when Bob rolls the die, he has a 1/6 chance to get 1. If he rolls 1, he rolls again. So each time he rolls a 1, it's like a trial that continues. This sounds like a geometric distribution problem.

In the geometric distribution, the expected number of trials until the first success is 1/p, where p is the probability of success on each trial. But in this case, the success isn't rolling a 1, because rolling a 1 means rolling again. So the probability of continuing the process (i.e., rolling again) is 1/6, and the probability of stopping (rolling something else) is 5/6.

Wait, no, actually, let me clarify. Each roll has a 1/6 chance of being 1, leading to another roll. So the process stops when he rolls a number that's not 1, which are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So each time he has a 1/6 chance to stop, and a 5/6 chance to continue.

So the expected number of rolls per day is the expected value of a geometric distribution where the probability of stopping (success) is 5/6. The expectation for the number of trials in a geometric distribution is 1/p, where p is the probability of success on each trial. So here, p = 5/6 (since each trial is a roll, and success is stopping). So the expected number of trials is 1/(5/6) = 6/5.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The geometric distribution models the number of trials until the first success, inclusive. So if the probability of success on each trial is q, then the expectation is 1/q. But in this case, each trial (roll) has a 5/6 chance of not stopping, so the probability of success (rolling non-1) is 5/6. So the expectation is 1/(5/6) = 6/5.

So each day, Bob expects to roll 6/5 times. So in a non-leap year, which has 365 days, the total expected number of rolls would be 365 multiplied by 6/5.

Calculating that: 365 * (6/5) = (365 * 6)/5. Let me compute that. 365 times 6 is 2190, divided by 5 is 438.

Wait, wait, but let me double-check. 6/5 is 1.2, and 365 * 1.2 = 438. That makes sense.

So the expected number of rolls per day is 6/5, and over 365 days, it's 365*(6/5) = 438.

Looking at the options, option E is 438, which should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the expectation. Another approach could be to model the expected number of rolls each day.

Let E be the expected number of rolls on a single day.

When Bob rolls the die, there's a 1/6 chance he rolls a 1, which means he has to roll again. So the expected number of rolls from that point is 1 (for the current roll) plus the expected number of additional rolls, which is E again. So the equation is:

E = (1/6)(1 + E) + (5/6)(1)

Wait, wait, no. That's not correct. Because when you roll a 1, you have to roll again, so that's adding 1 more roll plus the expected number of rolls from that point. So the equation should be:

E = (1/6)(1 + E) + (5/6)(1)

Wait, let's clarify. Each roll has a 1/6 chance of stopping (so 1 roll) and a 5/6 chance of continuing (so 1 roll plus the expected number of rolls from that point, which is E). So:

E = (1/6)(1) + (5/6)(1 + E)

Let me solve this equation.

E = (1/6) + (5/6)(1 + E)

Multiply through:

E = 1/6 + (5/6)(1) + (5/6)E

E = 1/6 + 5/6 + (5/6)E

1/6 +5/6 = 6/6 =1.

So E =1 + (5/6)E

Subtract (5/6)E from both sides:

E - (5/6)E =1

(1/6)E =1

E =6.

Wait, that gives E=6. That's conflicting with my previous calculation. Hmm.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, the initial roll is one. If he gets 1, he has to roll again. So in that case, the total rolls would be 1 (current) plus the expected rolls from the next roll.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation should model each roll as potentially continuing.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the expected number of times he rolls each day.

Each day, Bob rolls the die. The process is: roll once. If it's 1, he rolls again. So each day, the number of rolls is 1 plus, if it's 1, the expected number of rolls from the next day.

So let E be the expected number of rolls per day. Then:

E = 1 (for the first roll) + (1/6)*E (if he rolls a 1, he has to roll again, so the expected additional rolls is E).

So the equation is:

E = 1 + (1/6) E

Solving for E:

E - (1/6)E =1

(5/6)E =1

E =6/5 =1.2

Which matches my first calculation. So the expected number of rolls per day is 6/5, and over 365 days, it would be 365 * (6/5) = 438.

So the correct answer is 438, which is option E.
</think>

The expected number of rolls per day is calculated using the geometric distribution. Each roll has a 1/6 chance of stopping the process and a 5/6 chance of continuing. The expectation per day is 6/5. Over 365 days, this becomes 365*(6/5) = 438.

Answer: E: 438
