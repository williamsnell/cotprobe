Question:

A developer wished to build an apartment house in a local city. He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. Loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per month, starting one month after the completion of the apartment house. The loan is to be secured by a mortgage on the property. "The developer then contracted with a construction company to build the apartment for $800,000. After the contract was signed and construction had begun, the developer asked the investor when he would be receiving the $100,000 the investor promised to lend him. The investor replied, "I've changed my mind. I think this is too risky an investment. I'm not going to lend you the money. "In an appropriate action to secure specific performance of the investor's promise to lend him the $100,000, the developer will

Options:

A: win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.
B: win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.
C: lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.
D: lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.

Okay, let me try to figure out this legal question. So, the scenario is about a developer who took out a loan from an investor for $100,000. The investor initially agreed, and the developer contracted a construction company to build an apartment on a lot he bought.

But then, the investor decided to change his mind and not lend the money. The developer contracted construction but didn't finish yet. Now, when the developer asked for the $100,000, the investor said they're changing their mind. The question is about what the developer can do now to secure the $100,000.

So, the options are about whether the developer can win the case where he had to give up the money because the loan was repudiated. I remember that in contracts, if the promisor (the investor) changes their mind, the promise might be void. But wait, the promisor (investor) only has the right to terminate the contract if the promisor (developer) breached the terms. So, in this case, the developer contracted with a construction company but didn't start building yet. The promisor (investor) didn't breach any conditions because the developer hasn't begun building.

Wait, wait, but the promisor (investor) didn't actually pay the money upfront. The original agreement was for $100k. Then, the developer paid $50k to remove the lot. But the $100k was the loan from the investor. So, when the developer asked for the $100k, the investor responded that they're not going to lend it because they changed their mind.

I think the key here is whether the promisor's right to terminate the contract is affected by the promisor changing their mind. If the promisor (investor) agreed to lend the money, but then changed their mind, that's a breach of contract because the promisor no longer agrees to the terms. So, the promisor can't terminate the contract because they breached their promise. So, the developer cannot recover the $100k because the promisor didn't fulfill their obligation.

Wait, but waitâ€”some jurisdictions have the rule that if the promisor changes their mind, the promisor can choose to terminate the contract. But that depends on the jurisdiction and what the promisor agreed to. In some states, the promisor can choose to terminate if they change their mind, because the promisor has fulfilled their obligations. The promisor didn't breach the contract (they didn't perform the obligations), so they can't hold on to a non-performance.

So, the promisor (investor) agreed to lend the money but then decided not to. That's a breach of contract because they no longer are obligated to lend the $100k. Therefore, the promisor can't enforce the contract, so the developer can't recover the $100k.

Wait, but the options are about whether the developer can win. Looking at the options:

Option A: Win because there's a memorandum satisfying the statute of frauds. I think the Statute of Frauds requires a written agreement between the promisor and the promisee (the developer). But in this case, the developer contracted with a construction company but hasn't started yet. The promisor's agreement was for $100k. So, the promisor didn't breach that part. The issue isn't about the promisor's agreement, but whether they breached the promisee's contract.

Option B: Win because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate. I don't think that's correct. Even in unique land, the promisor can't terminate unless they breached. So, the remedy is the promisor can choose to terminate the contract, which the promisor didn't, so the developer can't get the money back.

Option C: Lose because the developer's only remedy is for damages. No, because the promisor can choose to terminate, so the developer can get the money back. So, option C is incorrect.

Option D: Lose because the developer can't show detrimental reliance. Hmm. Deliberate choice is a factor. But in this case, the promisor didn't breach the contract, so the promisor can terminate. So, the promisor's option is to terminate, not to choose. So, the developer can't show that the promisor acted deliberately to prevent the promisor from terminating. So, the developer can't recover the money. Therefore, the answer would be D. Because the promisor didn't breach, the developer can't get the money back.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The promisor (investor) agreed to lend the $100k to the developer. Then, the developer contracted to build the apartment, but the promisor didn't perform. So, the promisor didn't breach, but the promisor changed their mind. So, the promisor can choose to terminate the contract. So, the promisor didn't breach, but they chose to terminate, which is a right they have. So, the promisor can't enforce the contract, meaning the developer can't get the $100k back.

But the question is about what the developer can do. So, the available remedies are either damages (if the promisor terminated), but in this case, the promisor didn't. So, the developer can't get the money back because the promisor didn't breach.

So, the option where the developer can't get the $100k is D: lose because the developer can't show detrimental reliance.

Wait, but option B says the development was unique, so the promisor's remedy is inadequate. That doesn't seem right. Because even in unique land, the promisor can choose to terminate the contract.

Alternatively, maybe the promisor's right to terminate is limited. But no, as far as I know, the promisor can choose to terminate unless they breached. So, since the promisor didn't breach, the promisor can choose to terminate. So, the developer can't get the money back because the promisor can terminate.

So, the developer can't win back the $100k because the promisor didn't breach. Therefore, the answer would be D.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A: Win because of a written agreement. No, because the promisor never performed, only the promisee did.

B: Win because land is unique. I don't think that's the issue here. The promisor can choose to terminate regardless of the land's uniqueness.

C: Lose because only damages. No, because the promisor can choose to terminate. So, the developer can win back the money.

D: Lose because the promisor can't show detrimental reliance. The promisor didn't breach, so the promisor's option to end the contract is valid. Therefore, the developer can't get the money back because the promisor hasn't breached.

So, the correct answer must be D. Because the promisor didn't breach, the developer can't recover the $100k.
</think>

The correct answer is **D: lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance**.

**Explanation:**
The promisor (investor) agreed to lend $100,000 to the developer but then changed their mind. This constitutes a breach of contract because the promisor no longer agreed to perform their obligations. Since the promisor didn't breach the contract, they have the right to terminate the agreement. As a result, the developer cannot recover the $100,000 because the promisor (investor) did not perform in violating their obligation. The promisor's ability to choose to terminate the contract or to enforce the contract is not applicable here because the promisor didn't breach the contract. Therefore, the developer loses, and the promisor cannot enforce the contract.
