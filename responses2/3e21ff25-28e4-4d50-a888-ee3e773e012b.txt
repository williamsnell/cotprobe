Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the history of Teotihuacán. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking about the fact that early excavators mistook ordinary housing compounds for palaces. I remember that Teotihuacán was an ancient city in Pachacuti, Mexico. I think the city was famous for its advanced architecture, including palaces and temples. But some excavators thought it was a palace.

Wait, so what's the significance of that? If early people thought it was a palace, maybe they didn't realize it was a more complex structure. So, that might have suggested something about the society's structure.

The options are A through J. Let me look at them one by one.

Option A: Society was a theocracy ruled by high priests. Well, if they thought it was a palace, it might imply a central authority, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest point here.

Option B: Commoners took over the elite's houses. That sounds possible. If the excavators thought it was a palace, maybe they took over the top, but I'm not sure.

Option C: City a democracy ruled by common farmers. If they thought it was a palace, perhaps they ruled it as a center for power, but not necessarily a democracy.

Option D: High standard of living. If they thought it was a palace, maybe it was a better place, but I'm not sure how that directly relates.

Option E: Elite lived in ordinary housing to blend in. That sounds plausible. If they mistook the places for palaces, they might have been less central, so they lived in ordinary stuff to blend in.

Option F: Housing built for palaces. That's the opposite of what happened. If excavators thought it was a palace, that's a good point for F's opposite. But the question is about what this fact suggests.

Option G: Economic system based on wealth distribution. If it was a palace, maybe there was a wealth distribution, but I'm not certain.

Option H: City abandoned and later occupied by a different civilization. That's an unusual suggestion, but maybe not directly related to the fact that they thought it was a palace.

Option I: Society mostly egalitarian. If they thought it was a palace, perhaps it was more structured, implying less stratification. But I'm not sure if that's a direct conclusion.

Option J: Excavators were inexperienced. That's a possible detail, but the question relates to what the fact suggests.

Wait, the question is about what the fact suggests. The fact is that they mistook the places for palaces. So, if they thought it was a palace, maybe they didn't realize that it was a more complex structure. What does that suggest about society?

Option E says that the elite lived in ordinary housing to blend in. That makes sense. If the excavators thought it was a palace, they might have thought it was a more noble or important place, which they might have taken as something high, like a palace. So, if they didn't realize it was a palace, perhaps they thought it was a center of power, and they took the top housing for themselves, or they thought it was a more prominent place and didn't realize it was a complex structure, so they didn't recognize the need for other housing.

So the fact that they mistook it for a palace suggests that the society was such that the top housing was important, and the rest were ordinary, or that the elite didn't realize the complexity. So the idea that the elites lived in ordinary housing to blend in might be the case.

Alternatively, if they took over the top, perhaps they were the elite, but option E fits better because it's about blending in, not taking over the top. So the answer should be E.

The fact that early excavators mistook ordinary housing compounds for palaces suggests that the society's structure was such that the elite or the top housing was significant and important. This indicates that the elite may have lived in ordinary housing to blend in, as option E suggests.

Answer: E
