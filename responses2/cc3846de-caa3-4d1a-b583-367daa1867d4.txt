Question:

InBrowningtown, water is sold to home owners by the cubic foot at the rate of $15.31 for up to and including 3,600 cubic feet, and $.15 for each 100 cubic feet over 3,600 cubic feet. Local taxes on water usage are 4%. If the Thomas family recently received a bill for 35,700 cubic feet of water, how much were they charged?

Options:

A: $64
B: $58
C: $70
D: $80
E: $66
F: $60
G: $78
H: $74
I: $72
J: $68

Okay, so I need to figure out how much the Thomas family was charged for their water bill in Browington. Let's see, the question says that water is sold at a certain rate, and there's a tax involved. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the pricing structure: up to 3,600 cubic feet is $15.31. For each 100 cubic feet over that, it's an additional $0.15. So, if they use more than 3,600, the charge is higher. 

The Thomas family used 35,700 cubic feet. That's way more than 3,600. So I need to calculate how much the basic charge is, plus the tax.

Let me calculate the basic cost first. The first 3,600 is $15.31. Then, the remaining is 35,700 - 3,600 = 32,100 cubic feet. Now, each 100 over 3,600 is $0.15. So 32,100 / 100 = 321. So 321 segments at $0.15 each. Let me compute that: 321 * 0.15. Hmm, 300*0.15 is 45, and 21*0.15 is 3.15. So total for the over part is 48.15.

So the basic charge is $15.31 + $48.15 = $63.46.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the math. 32,100 divided by 100 is 321. Multiply by 0.15: 321 * 0.15. Alternatively, 0.15 is 15 cents, so 321 * 15 cents. 300 * 0.15 = 45, 21 * 0.15=3.15, so yes, 48.15. So total is 15.31 + 48.15 = 63.46.

But wait, wait, no, wait another second. 32,100 divided by 100 is 321. So 321 * 0.15 is 48.15. So yes, correct. So the basic charge is 15.31 + 48.15 = 63.46.

Now, we have to add the 4% local taxes. So 63.46 * 1.04. Let me compute that.

63.46 * 0.04 is 2.5384. So adding to 63.46 gives 63.46 + 2.5384 = 65.9984, approximately $66.00.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest one is E, which is $66. But let me double-check because maybe I made a mistake in the number of segments.

Wait, 35,700 - 3,600 is 32,100. So 32,100 / 100 is 321. So 321 * 0.15 is 48.15. So 15.31 + 48.15 is 63.46. Then 4% tax is 63.46 * 1.04 = 65.9984, which is roughly $66. So the bill would be $66, which is option E.

Wait, but the options given are from A to J. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: $64  
B: $58  
C: $70  
D: $80  
E: $66  
F: $60  
G: $78  
H: $74  
I: $72  
J: $68

So E is $66, which matches what I calculated.

The calculation involves determining the basic water charge and then applying the 4% tax. For 35,700 cubic feet:

1. Basic charge: The first 3,600 cubic feet are $15.31. The remaining 32,100 cubic feet are charged at $0.15 per 100 cubic feet, totaling $48.15. The basic charge is $15.31 + $48.15 = $63.46.

2. Local taxes: 4% of $63.46 is approximately $2.54, making the total charge $63.46 + $2.54 = $66.00.

3. The closest option is E: $66.
