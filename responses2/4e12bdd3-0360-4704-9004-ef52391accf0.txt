Okay, so I have this Python question to solve. The question is: In Python 3, what is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1][-3]? The options are A to J, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that when you access an element in a list using square brackets, it's zero-based. So the first element is at index 0, the second at 1, and so on. So if the list is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1], the index 0 is 'a', 1 is 'Chemistry', 2 is 0, and 3 is 1.

Wait, so the list has four elements. Let's list them out:

Index 0: 'a'
Index 1: 'Chemistry'
Index 2: 0
Index 3: 1

The question is asking for [-3]. So that would be the element at index -3. Wait a second, negative indices in Python are a bit different. Negative numbers count from the end, right? So index -1 is the last element, -2 the second last, etc.

Let's think: For a list with four elements (indices 0-3):

-1 is index 3, which is 1.
-2 is index 2, which is 0.
-3 is index 1, which is 'Chemistry'.

So the element at index -3 is 'Chemistry'. Let me confirm: the list is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1]. So the elements are:

0: 'a'
1: 'Chemistry'
2: 0
3: 1

So [-3] is the third element from the end. Since there are four elements, the third from the end is index 1. So the value is 'Chemistry'.

Looking at the options, option A is 'Chemistry'. So the correct answer should be A.

The list is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1]. Accessing [-3] gives the element at index 1, which is 'Chemistry'. 

Answer: A
