Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about a population where those who are really tall and those really short have a decrease in relative frequency compared to medium-sized individuals. The reason given is a change in the availability of resources. The options are various types of selection—like convergent, stabilizing, etc.—and I need to pick which one fits.

Wait, let's break down the scenario. The population's tall and short individuals are decreasing relative to medium-sized. So, the frequencies of tall and short are going down. That suggests that the environment is changing because the resources available are changing. Because when resources are more abundant, organisms might change strategies to exploit those resources better. 

So, when the environment changes and the organisms adjust by increasing their tall or short traits, that's called selection acting to change traits. This kind of change in traits under varying conditions is known as directional selection. Directional selection occurs when one extreme of a trait is favored over the other.

Looking at the options:

A: Convergent evolution. That's when species evolve similar traits independently. Not sure how that fits here.

B: Stabilizing selection. This is when the mean of a trait stabilizes, so maybe the population's traits stay around a certain point. Like if selection is keeping the average height around a certain level, but not necessarily changing extremes. So not sure if this is the case here.

C: Genetic drift. That's about random changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations. It's more about chance in small groups, not about environmental changes altering traits.

D: Disruptive selection. That's when both extremes are selected against. For example, if something is bad for tall and also bad for short, then both extremes get reduced. But the question says tall and short decrease, but medium remains. So maybe not disruptive.

E: Directional selection. That's exactly what I was thinking. When one extreme is favored over the other. So this seems to fit.

F: Bottleneck effect. That's a drastic reduction in population size, leading to a loss of genetic diversity. Not related to traits changing due to resource availability.

G: Bottleneck effect. No, same as F.

H: Adaptive radiation. That's when a population splits into two, each adapting to different environments. This doesn't seem to fit here either.

I: Founder effect. This is when a population expands rapidly due to a favorable gene pool, leading to new traits. Not related to resource changes.

J: Sexual selection. That's about traits selected for by sexual dimorphism. Again, not directly about environmental changes affecting traits.

So the correct answer should be E: directional selection.

The scenario describes a population where tall and short individuals decrease in frequency relative to medium-sized individuals, driven by a change in resource availability. This indicates that the traits are being selected to favor one extreme, which is directional selection.

Answer: E
