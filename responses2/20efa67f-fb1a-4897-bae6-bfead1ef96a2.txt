Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these insurance math problems. Let's take it step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. Mr. Charles owns two assets: a brick building worth $35,000 and stock worth $9,500. He wants to insure each at 4/5 of their value. The insurance rates are given as $.23 per $100 for the building and $.21 per $100 for the stock. I need to find the total cost of his coverage each year.

Hmm, so I think I need to calculate the insurance cost for each asset separately and then add them together. That makes sense because each is being insured individually.

Let's start with the building. The building is worth $35,000. He insures it at 4/5 of its value. So, first, what's 4/5 of $35,000?

Let me calculate that: 4/5 is 0.8. So, 0.8 multiplied by 35,000. Let's see, 35,000 * 0.8 = 28,000. So he insures the building for $28,000 worth. But wait, the insurance is priced per $100, not the total amount. Oh right, the rate is $.23 per $100. So, I need to find how many $100 units are in $28,000 and then multiply by the rate.

How many $100s are in $28,000? Well, 28,000 divided by 100 is 280. So, 280 units. Each unit costs $.23. So, 280 * 0.23. Let me compute that. 280 * 0.23. Hmm, 280 * 0.2 is 56, and 280 * 0.03 is 8.4, so adding those gives 56 + 8.4 = 64.4. So, the insurance cost for the building is $64.40 per year.

Now, moving on to the stock. The stock is worth $9,500. He insures it at 4/5 of its value. So, 4/5 of $9,500. Let's calculate that: 0.8 * 9,500 = 7,600. So the stock is insured for $7,600. Now, using the same rate of $.21 per $100.

How many $100s are in $7,600? 7,600 divided by 100 is 76. So, 76 units. Each is $0.21. So, 76 * 0.21. Let me compute that. 70 * 0.21 is 14.7, and 6 * 0.21 is 1.26, so adding those gives 14.7 + 1.26 = 15.96. So, that's approximately $16 per year.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me check that math again. 76 * 0.21. Let's compute it differently. 0.21 is the same as 21 cents, so 76 * 0.21. Alternatively, 76 * 21 = 1,596. Then, since it's 0.21, we need to divide by 100. So, 1,596 / 100 = $15.96. So, $15.96 which is approximately $16.

Wait, but I should double-check. 21 times 76: 20*76=1,520 and 1*76=76, so total 1,596. Then, 1,596 / 100 is 15.96, which is $15.96. So, about $16 per year.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me do 76 * 0.21 again. 0.21 * 76. Let's break it down: 

0.21 * 70 = 14.7

0.21 * 6 = 1.26

Sum: 14.7 + 1.26 = 15.96.

Yes, that's correct. So, $15.96.

Now, adding both the building and stock insurance costs. The building is $64.40 and the stock is $15.96. Let's add them together: 64.40 + 15.96.

Adding the dollars: 64 + 15 = 79. Adding the cents: 0.40 + 0.96 = 1.36. So, total is 79 + 1.36 = 80.36.

Wait, but that's approximately $80.36. Looking at the options, option F is $80 per year. So, that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate both correctly? Let me double-check each step.

Building: 4/5 of $35,000 is $28,000. 28,000 divided by 100 is 280. 280 * 0.23 = ?

Let me compute 280 * 0.23. 200 * 0.23 is 46, and 80 * 0.23 is 18.4. Adding them gives 46 + 18.4 = 64.4. That's correct.

Stock: 4/5 of $9,500 is 0.8 * 9,500 = 7,600. 7,600 /100 =76. 76 * 0.21 = ?

76 * 0.2 = 15.2, 76 * 0.01 = 0.76. So, 15.2 + 0.76 = 15.96. Correct.

So, 64.4 + 15.96 = 80.36, which is approximately $80.36. So, the closest option is F: $80 per year.

Wait, but the options are given as per year. So, the answer is F.

To determine the cost of Charles' insurance, we calculate the annual insurance required for each asset and sum them.

1. **Building Insurance:**
   - Value: $35,000
   - Insured amount: 4/5 of $35,000 = $28,000
   - Rate: $0.23 per $100
   - Calculation: 28,000 / 100 = 280 units → 280 * 0.23 = $64.40

2. **Stock Insurance:**
   - Value: $9,500
   - Insured amount: 4/5 of $9,500 = $7,600
   - Rate: $0.21 per $100
   - Calculation: 7,600 / 100 = 76 units → 76 * 0.21 = $15.96

3. **Total Insurance Cost:**
   - $64.40 (building) + $15.96 (stock) = $80.36 ≈ $80 per year.

The closest option is F: $80 per year.

**Answer: F**
