Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's model on racial/cultural identity development. Let me think about what I know.

The question is asking when people start to question their rejection of all aspects of dominant culture and become absolutely loyal to their own culture. The options are A to J, each with different stages.

Wait, the model they're referring to is called the Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model, right? I remember it's like a three-stage model. The stages are about how people develop their identity over time.

So the model has three main phases. The first phase is resistance and immersion. That's when people are trying to integrate into a new culture and feel rejected. Resistance is when they don't fit, and immersion is when they start to immerse themselves in the culture.

Then the second phase is integrative awareness. This sounds like when they start to see the connections between their own culture and the dominant culture. They're more aware of how to blend their culture into the dominant one.

The third phase is reintegration. That's when they become fully committed and loyal to their own culture, integrating into the dominant culture without any rejections anymore.

Wait, but the question is about when they start to question their rejection and become loyal. So the initial stages are resistance and immersion. Because that's when they're learning to integrate and rejecting the dominant culture.

So the stages mentioned are A: resistance and immersion, and B: integrative awareness. The question is asking which stage begins the process where they start to question their rejection and become loyal, which would be the first two stages.

The options given are A, B, etc. So the correct stages would be A and B. But looking at the options, the choices are single options.

Wait, the question says "begin to question their rejection..." So it's about the starting point. So the first two stages are the beginning. But the options are single letters. Hmm.

Wait the first stage is resistance and immersion, which is option A. The second is integrative awareness, option B. But the question is about when they start to question their rejection and become loyal. So that's the initial stages, which are A and B. But the options only allow for one correct answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question is about the stage when they start to question their rejection. So the first stage, resistance and immersion, is when they begin to question and learn to integrate. So the answer would be A.

But wait, the model's stages are: resistance and immersion, integrative awareness, reintegration. So the initial stages are A, and then B is the next.

The question says, "begin to question their rejection..." So the answer is the first two phases. But the options don't have an option that combines A and B. So perhaps the first stage is A, and the second is B. But the question is about the stage, so the first one is correct, and the second is the next.

Wait, but the question is about when they begin to question their rejection. So that's the first stage, resistance and immersion, which is A. Or is it that they start with integration and then question?

Wait, no. The model is about how their identity develops. The first stage is resistance and immersion, which is when they start to integrate into the dominant culture and reject it, perhaps gaining awareness.

Wait, perhaps the initial stages are resistance and immersion (A), then they start seeing the connections (B), then they fully integrate and become loyal (I think, but I'm not sure about that). So the question is about when they start to question rejection, which would be A, and then B comes next.

But the question is asking which stage begins the process. So the first stage is A, and the second is B. But the options are single letters.

Looking back at the options, the possible answers are A, B, C, etc.

Wait, the question is phrased as "begin to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture." So the first point is when they question their rejection, which is the beginning of the process. So that would be the first stage, which is A: resistance and immersion.

Alternatively, maybe the model's first phase is about resistance and immersion, which is when they start to integrate. So the question is, when do they start to question their rejection and become loyal. So the initial stages are A, and then B is the next.

But the options given are single letters, so perhaps the answer is A, but I thought the later stages are B, etc.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual stages. The Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model (RCIDM) has three stages:

1. Resistance and Immersion: Where people are trying to integrate into a dominant culture, rejecting it, and learning to do so.

2. Integrative Awareness: Where people see connections between their own culture and the dominant culture, develop awareness of how to blend them.

3. Reintegration: Where they commit to their own culture, integrating into the dominant without rejections.

So the question is about when they start to question their rejection and become loyal. That's the first two stages. So the initial stages are A (resistance and immersion), and then B (integrative awareness). But the question is asking which stage begins the process—so the answer would be A.

Wait, but the options are single letters. So perhaps the model's stages are:

Option A: resistance and immersion: the first stage.

The question is about the beginning of their development, which is when they start to question their rejection. So that's the first stage, A.

But wait, another approach: the question is phrased as "begin to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture." So the process begins with the first stage, where they start to question their rejection and learn to integrate.

So the correct answer is option A: resistance and immersion.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because sometimes the model may have different phases. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: the stages in the model are:

1. Resistance and Immersion: people trying to integrate into dominant culture, rejecting it, and learning to do so.

2. Integrative Awareness: seeing connections between own culture and dominant.

3. Reintegration: becoming fully integrated.

So the question is about the first step where they start to question their rejection. That's the first phase, so option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the stage where they start to become loyal. That would be reintegration, option I, but that's the third stage.

Wait, wait. The question is about when they begin to question their own rejection and become loyal. So they start to question and learn to integrate (resistance and immersion), which is the first stage.

So the correct answer is A.

The Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model (RCIDM) proposes three stages for the development of racial and cultural identity. The first stage, resistance and immersion, involves people trying to integrate into a dominant culture, rejecting it, and learning to do so. This is the initial stage where they start to question their rejection and gain awareness of cultural integration. The second stage, integrative awareness, involves seeing connections between their culture and the dominant culture. The third stage, reintegration, is when they become fully committed and loyal to their own culture. Since the question asks about the beginning of the process where they question rejection and become loyal, the correct answer is the first stage, resistance and immersion.

Answer: A
