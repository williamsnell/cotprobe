Okay, so I've got this equation here: x plus 71 equals negative 22. Hmm, I need to find out what x is. Let me think about how to solve this step by step. 

Alright, the equation is x + 71 = -22. I remember that to solve for x, I should get x by itself on one side of the equation. So, I think I need to do the opposite of adding 71. Since it's plus 71, I'll subtract 71 from both sides. Wait, or is it the other way around? No, wait, if I subtract 71 from both sides, that should isolate x. 

Let me write that down: x + 71 - 71 = -22 - 71. Oh wait, but wait a second, that would mean x equals -22 -71. Let me calculate that. 22 plus 71... 22 plus 70 is 92, plus 1 is 93. So that's -93. So x equals -93. 

Wait, but let me double-check. If I plug x=-93 back into the original equation, does it work? Let's see: -93 +71 is equal to what? That's the same as 71 -93, which is -22. Yes, that matches the right side of the equation. So that's correct. 

Looking at the options: A is 49, B is 50. C is 93, D is -94, E is 94, F is -71, G is 0, H is -50, I is -93, J is -49. So the correct answer is I, which is -93. I think that's the right one.
