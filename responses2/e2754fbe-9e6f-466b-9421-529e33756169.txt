Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, "On the Suppression of Sati," 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826

B: That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits
C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about William Bentinck and his essay. Let me try to unpack what it's about and figure out the right answer.

The question is about the last character of the response needing to be the letter chosen. The options are A to J, but each option is a letter. The main point is about the essay's content, which I think relates to imperialism and resistance.

The essay in question is about William Bentinck's "On the Suppression of Sati," 1829. The text discusses the impact of Indian trade and the necessity of controlling the Indians. The key point is that Bentinck believes the Indians must be ruled by a rod of iron, implying they must be kept in a proper state of subordination, which is achieved by letting them feel their dependence on the foodstuffs and manufactured goods they receive.

The question is asking which option it's referring to in the essay. The options are about how this essay undermines a commonly held assumption about Western imperialism. The options are about different aspects of imperialism: religious practices, profit concern, cultural norms, or force.

So, I need to think about what was the common assumption that Bentinck is undermining. The essay's central point is that the Indians were treated like animals, which suggests that European colonialism was more about exploiting resources than ensuring the well-being of the local populations.

The options:

A: That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices. I don't think that's implied. The essay doesn't mention anything about religious practices, so maybe not A.

B: That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits. The essay discusses the impact of Indian trade, which is linked to profits, but it's more about control and subordination, not specifically about profit concern.

C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations. The essay says they were letting the Indians feel their dependence on food and goods, which suggests a controlled and applied approach, not a rigid adherence to cultural norms. So maybe C is not the right answer.

D: That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects. This seems off because the essay talks about letting them feel their dependence, not about using force. The essay's approach was more about controlled, not forced, methods.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The essay's main idea is about the necessity of controlling the Indians. So, Bentinck is advocating for a more severe form of oppression than what was happening before. So, the common assumption might have been that imperialism was more about exploitation of resources than ensuring the welfare of the colonies.

Looking at the options again:

Option B says colonizers were deeply concerned about profits. The essay doesn't explicitly state that, but it's a factor. However, the essay's point is more about control and subordination, not about profit.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because it's about profit, which is a key aspect of imperialism. The essay does mention that the Indians trade with the British, which is a form of exploitation tied to profit.

Wait, the essay says, "The first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?" So the essay is arguing against the idea that imperialism was just about exploiting resources, but more about controlling and subordinating the colonized.

So, the common assumption (the one the essay is trying to undermine) might be that imperialism was just about exploiting resources, like resources of the colonizer. But the essay's approach was about ensuring the proper treatment of the colonized, which was seen as more of a control. So the common assumption might be that imperialism was just about exploiting, but the essay is showing that it was also about controlling.

So the answer is that the essay is undermining the assumption that imperialism was just about exploiting resources. So the options are B and maybe D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: concerned deeply with turning profits. The essay does talk about the profits from Indian trade, but the main point is about control and subordination. So it's more about the economic aspect, not the profit concern.

Option D: resorted to armed force. The essay doesn't mention anything about armed force. It talks about letting them feel their dependence on food and goods, which is a more controlled approach.

So if the essay is about the necessity of controlling and subordinating, then the common assumption being undermined is that imperialism was just about exploiting. So the answer is B: that European colonizers were deeply concerned about turning profits.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. The original options are A to J, but the question is about which letter is the correct one.

So the correct answer is B? Because the essay is arguing that the treatment of the Indians was too brutal, and the common assumption is that imperialism was more about exploiting resources than ensuring their well-being. So the essay is undermining that assumption by showing that the treatment was not just about exploiting, but about controlling, which is a different assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B. Wait, but the essay mentions that the Indians trade with the British, which is a form of exploitation tied to profit. So the essay's argument is that the treatment of the colonized was not just about exploitation but also about controlling them. So the common assumption was that imperialism was just about exploiting, leading to the essay's argument that it was also about controlling.

So the answer is B: that European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits. Because the essay is pointing out that the treatment of the Indians was not just about exploiting but also about controlling, which is a different assumption.

Wait, but the essay does mention profits, but it's not the main point. The main point is about control, which is a different assumption.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. But I don't think so.

Wait, the essay's point is that the treatment was not just about exploitation but also about control. So the common assumption was that imperialism was just about exploiting. Hence, the essay's argument is that it wasn't just about exploitation, but also about controlling. So the answer would be B: concerned about turning profits. Because the essay's argument is that the treatment was not just about the exploitation (like profits) but also about controlling, which is a different assumption.

Wait, but the essay does talk about profits, but the way it's framed is that the Indians were being exploited. So maybe the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering that the essay's main point is about letting them feel their dependence on food and goods, implying a controlled approach, so the common assumption was that imperialism was just about exploiting resources, not about controlling. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The essay's main idea is that the British controlled the Indians by letting them feel their dependence on food and manufactured goods. So the essay is arguing that the treatment of the colonized was not just about exploitation, but also about control. Hence, the common assumption (that imperialism was just about exploiting) is being refuted.

So the correct answer is B: that European colonizers were deeply concerned about turning profits. Because the essay discusses that the exploitation was tied to profits, implying that the treatment wasn't just about the exploit (like profits) but also about control.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the essay says they were letting them feel their dependence on food and goods, which is a controlled approach, which might be seen as a form of suppression rather than force. But the essay doesn't say they resorted to force; they were letting them feel their dependence, implying they weren't strictly controlled.

Wait, but the essay says "expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding," which implies a controlled approach, but the essay itself doesn't state that they resorted to force. So the answer is D: that colonizers often resorted to armed force. But I don't think so, because the essay's approach was more about letting them feel their dependence, not using force.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of other possibilities. Another approach: the options are letters A-J, each is a single letter.

The question's stem says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So after I choose an answer, I write that letter, and that's the last character.

So the options are A to J, each is one letter.

Looking back at the options:

A: That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices.

B: That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits.

C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.

D: That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects.

The essay is about letting the Indians feel their dependence on food and goods. So it's about controlling, which is a different assumption than just exploiting. So the common assumption was that the empire was just about exploiting resources. Hence, the essay is refuting that assumption by pointing out that the treatment wasn't just about exploiting but also about controlling. So the answer is B: concerned deeply with profits.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D, but I don't think so because the essay's approach was to let them feel their dependence, which is a controlled approach, but the essay doesn't mention force.

Wait, another thought: the essay is about letting the Indians feel dependent, which implies they were let down. So that's a different assumption. So the answer is B: concerned deeply with turning profits.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D, but I don't think that's the case. The essay's point isn't about force, just about control. So I think the answer is B.
</think>

The essay in question, "On the Suppression of Sati," by William Bentinck, argues that the British Empire, particularly India, treated the local inhabitants with extreme measures, including letting them feel their dependence on food and manufactured goods. This approach suggests a controlled and applied method of exploitation rather than a more traditional form of suppression. The essay's central theme is the necessity of controlling the Native population, which undermines the common assumption that Western imperialism was primarily focused on exploiting resources rather than ensuring the well-being of the colonized.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices.**  
  The essay does not discuss religious practices, so this is not relevant.

- **B: That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits.**  
  The essay does touch on the economic exploitation of the Native population through trade, which is tied to profit concerns. However, the essay's main argument is about controlling the population, not just exploiting. While there is a connection, this is not the primary point of contention.

- **C: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.**  
  The essay does not mention cultural norms or force, so this is not applicable.

- **D: That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects.**  
  The essay's approach was more about controlled measures, not force. Thus, this is not the correct answer.

- **E: That European colonizers were more concerned with maintaining the political stability of India.**  
  This is unrelated to the essay's focus on control and treatment of the population.

- **F: That European colonizers were resistant to cultural and religious influences from other civilizations.**  
  Again, irrelevant as the essay does not discuss such issues.

- **G: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to exploit resources for the benefit of their colonies.**  
  This is the common assumption the essay refutes. The essay's approach was to control the population, not exploit resources.

- **H: That European colonizers were concerned about the psychological well-being of their subjects.**  
  While the essay discusses psychological aspects (dependence on food and goods), it is not the primary focus.

- **I: That European colonizers were uniformly eager to use force to maintain their dominance over their subjects.**  
  The essay does not mention force, so this is not relevant.

- **J: That European colonizers were concerned about the economic exploitation of their subjects.**  
  This is a factor in the essay, but the essay's main argument is about control, not just exploitation.

### Conclusion:
The essay undermines the common assumption that Western imperialism was primarily focused on exploiting resources by advocating for controlled measures, such as letting the Native population feel dependent on food and goods. This approach reflects a different assumption about the nature of imperialism. Therefore, the correct answer is **B: That European colonizers were deeply concerned about turning profits**.
