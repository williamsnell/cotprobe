Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a spring-mass system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem states that the acceleration of the mass is a function of displacement: a(x) = -(k/m)x. Oh wait, that looks familiar. I remember that the equation of motion for a spring is F = ma, and Hooke's law is F = -kx. So substituting, ma = -kx, which gives a = -(k/m)x. So yeah, that's correct.

The mass starts from rest at displacement x = -rho. So the initial velocity v0 is zero. I need to find the velocity as a function of displacement.

Wait, the standard approach for this is to use energy conservation. Because in a spring system, the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) should remain constant if there's no external force other than the spring force.

So, the potential energy of the spring is (1/2)k x², right? And the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So the total mechanical energy E is conserved.

At the initial position, x = -rho, and velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. Thus, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)k (rho)^2. Because x is rho because the displacement is -rho, but squared, so the potential is the same regardless of direction.

Now, as the mass moves, the displacement is x. So at any point x, the potential energy is (1/2)k x². The kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². So the total energy is (1/2)k x² + (1/2)m v² = (1/2)k rho^2.

Wait, but wait. At the initial position, x is -rho, but when x is positive, it's rho, but that's okay because it's squared.

So, setting up the equation:

(1/2) k x² + (1/2) m v² = (1/2) k rho².

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the 1/2:

k x² + m v² = k rho².

Then, solving for v²:

m v² = k rho² - k x².

Factor out k:

m v² = k (rho² - x²).

Divide both sides by m:

v² = (k/m) (rho² - x²).

Hmm, looking at the options, that matches option F: v² = (ho^2 - x²) (k/m). Wait, wait, no. Oh wait, option F says (ho^2 - x^2). Oh wait, wait, that's not the same as the rho squared. Because in the problem, the initial displacement is -rho, but maybe in the question, ho is another variable? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So perhaps I should double-check the problem statement.

Wait, the problem statement says displacement is -rho. So when x is the displacement, it's -rho initially. But in the options, the initial condition for the system is that the displacement is -rho.

Wait, so the initial potential energy is (1/2)k rho², because x is rho when considering displacement.

So, the equation I derived is v² = (k/m) (rho² - x²). So looking at the options, which option matches this?

Looking at the options:

A: v² = (ho - x^2)(k/m)
B: v² = (ho² + x²)(k/m)
C: v = sqrt( (rho²/x) (k/m) )
D: v² = (rho² x²)(k/m)
E: v = sqrt( (rho + x²)(k/m) )
F: v² = (ho^2 - x^2)(k/m)
G: v^2 = (2 rho^2 - x^2)(k/m)
H: v^2 = rho(k/m) - x^2
I: v^2 = (rho^2 + 2x^2)(k/m)
J: v^2 = (ho^2 - x)(k/m)

Wait, option F is (ho² -x²)(k/m). Hmm, but I don't see 'ho' in the problem. The problem's given is a(x) = - (k/m)x. So perhaps 'ho' might be a typo or a misinterpretation of 'rho'? Like, maybe they meant 'rho' as in rho squared?

Wait, in the question, the initial displacement is given as -rho. But in option F, it's 'ho' instead of rho. Hmm, that's confusing. Because the problem says rho, but the options have 'ho' in one option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check.

Wait, our initial potential energy is (1/2)k (rho)^2. So the equation is v² = (k/m) (rho² -x²).

But option F says (ho² -x²), so perhaps 'ho' is a typo for rho. Let me see the options again.

Wait, in the problem, the options say options A to J. Let me look again:

Option F: v² = (ho² -x^2) (k/m)

So, if 'ho' is rho, then it would match. But the problem didn't use 'ho' as a variable, so perhaps in the problem statement, 'ho' is a typo and should be 'rho'.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial potential energy.

Wait, the problem says displacement is -rho. So when the mass is at x = -rho, the potential energy is (1/2)k (-rho)^2 = (1/2)k rho². So that's correct.

So the equation v² = (k/m)( rho² - x² )

But looking at the options:

Which option matches (k/m)(rho² - x²)? Let's see:

Option F: (ho² -x^2)(k/m). If 'ho' is rho, then yes. But the problem says 'rho' as the initial displacement.

Wait, but the options don't have 'rho' as a variable. So the answer must be in terms of rho. So perhaps option F is incorrect.

Wait, the problem statement says the mass is started from rest at displacement -rho. So the initial displacement is -rho. But the equation we have is v squared equals (k/m)(rho squared minus x squared). So when x is -rho, x squared is rho squared, so the initial condition is correct.

Wait, but in our equation, if x is the displacement, and rho is the initial value, then x can be any value. So when x is zero, v is rho sqrt(k/m), which makes sense.

Hmm, but looking at the options again, option F doesn't have rho squared. The problem didn't use 'rho' as a variable, just the initial displacement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem says "the mass is started from rest at a displacement of -rho". So the initial displacement is x = -rho.

So when x = -rho, velocity is zero. So the total energy is (1/2)k rho². At any other point, kinetic energy plus potential is that. So:

(1/2)k x² + (1/2)m v² = (1/2)k rho².

Multiply both sides by 2:

k x² + m v² = k rho².

Solving for v²:

m v² = k ( rho² - x² )

v² = (k/m)( rho² - x² )

So that's the equation.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option F is (ho² -x²) (k/m). So if 'ho' is 'rho', then yes. But the problem didn't use 'ho' as a variable. Maybe the problem uses rho for 'ho'? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the problem says the options are A to J, with 'ho' appearing in one of them.

Wait, perhaps 'ho' is a typo and it should be 'rho'? Because if 'ho' is rho, then option F would be correct.

But then, the problem says the initial displacement is -rho. So when x is -rho, the potential is (1/2)k (rho)^2, so that's correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 'rho' as a variable, so perhaps option F is incorrect because it uses 'ho' instead of 'rho'.

Wait, but the problem uses 'rho' as the initial displacement. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but looking back, none of the options seem to have 'rho' squared as part of the expression.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option F is v² = (ho^2 - x^2) (k/m). No, that doesn't match.

Option G is v² = (2 rho^2 - x^2) (k/m). Hmm, that's different.

Option D is v squared equals rho squared x squared times (k/m). No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the correct formula for energy. Wait, the potential energy is (1/2)k x squared, yes. The kinetic is (1/2) m v squared.

So the equation is correct.

But none of the options seem to match. So perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me re-express the equation.

We have v² = (k/m)( rho² - x² )

Which can be written as v² = (k/m) rho² - (k/m) x².

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo and 'rho' is not the same as 'ho' in the options. Or perhaps 'ho' is a variable that's defined elsewhere, but in this problem, it's not given.

Hmm, but the options provided don't have rho squared. Wait, perhaps rho is the initial displacement, which is the maximum displacement, so the amplitude of the oscillation.

Wait, the equation is v^2 = (k/m) (rho squared - x squared). But if the system is oscillating, perhaps x can vary between -rho and rho. So in that case, the maximum velocity occurs at x=0.

Wait, but in the equation v squared is (k/m) (rho^2 - x^2). So when x=0, v is rho sqrt(k/m), which is the maximum velocity. That makes sense.

Hmm, so looking at option F, which is (ho^2 -x^2)(k/m). If 'ho' is rho, that's correct. But the problem statement didn't use 'ho' as a variable. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking again at the problem statement: it says the last character of the answer must be the letter you've chosen. So perhaps the correct answer is one of the options.

Wait, option F is (ho^2 -x^2)(k/m). If 'ho' is rho, then it's (rho^2 -x^2)(k/m), which matches the correct equation.

So option F is the correct answer.

The problem involves a spring-mass system where the acceleration is given as \( a(x) = -\frac{k}{m}x \). The mass starts from rest at a displacement of \(-\rho\). To determine the velocity as a function of displacement, energy conservation is applied. The potential energy of the spring is \( \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \), and the kinetic energy is \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). At the initial position (\(x = -\rho\)), the velocity is zero, so the total energy is purely potential:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}k\rho^2
\]

At any displacement \(x\), the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}k\rho^2
\]

Multiplying through by 2 and solving for \(v^2\):

\[
kx^2 + mv^2 = k\rho^2 \implies v^2 = \frac{k}{m}(\rho^2 - x^2)
\]

This matches the equation derived from energy conservation. Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option F**: \( v^2 = (\rho^2 - x^2)\frac{k}{m} \) matches the derived equation.
- Other options either do not match the derived equation or use incorrect variables.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: F**
