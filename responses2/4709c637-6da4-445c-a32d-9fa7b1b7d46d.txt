Question:

A police officer entered a private home in response to a reported disturbance. She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with "deviate sexual intercourse", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?

Options:

A: The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.
B: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes on the men's Ninth Amendment rights, which protect other rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.
C: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes the men's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.
D: The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.
E: The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.
F: The statute is constitutional as it promotes the common good.
G: The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.
H: The statute is constitutional as it is based on the state's interpretation of religious principles.
I: The statute is unconstitutional as it goes against the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.
J: The statute is constitutional because it falls within the state's police power to regulate health, safety, welfare, and morals.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with state vs federal rights. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question describes a scenario where a police officer enters a home in response to a reported disturbance. She finds no disturbance but sees two men engaged in consensual sexual relations. These men were charged with "deviate sexual intercourse," which is a state law that prohibits two same-sex individuals from having mutual sexual relations. After successfully being convicted and failing to get any state court appeals, the men are appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. The question is about what the Supreme Court would likely hold regarding the constitutionality of this statute.

First, I need to understand the key elements here. The main issue is whether the state's law is constitutional. The law in question, "deviate sexual intercourse," is a state statute that prohibits same-sex couples from having mutual sexual relations. So, it's about sex, specifically sexual relations between individuals of the same sex.

I think the key here is the so-called "same-sex marriage" issue. The Supreme Court has dealt with this before. The recent cases highlight the importance of constitutional limits on such laws. For example, in cases like Everson v. City of New York, the Supreme Court upheld sex education laws, which were deemed constitutional. Similarly, in McCulloch v. Maryland, the Court upheld laws restricting the use of the power of a state's religion to regulate private matters.

Wait, but this case isn't about religion. It's about sexual relations. So, the statute is about sex, same-sex. So, it's a concern under the constitutional right to be free from unreasonable restrictions. The key is whether the law is a violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause or constitutional rights.

The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the government from establishing or supporting religion. But this law isn't about religion; it's about sex. However, the Supreme Court has held that laws addressing sexual relations are constitutional if they don't infringe on constitutional rights, like the right to life, liberty, or the press.

Wait, but the question is about the men's rights. So, the statute prohibits two same-sex individuals from having mutual sexual relations. So, does this infringe on their rights? For example, the right to privacy. TheCity law examples sometimes relate to privacy because they regulate how a state regulates private matters.

Wait, no. The City law was about sex education, which affected the children's privacy. But this statute is about sexual relations, which could be about privacy. So, the statute might be considered a state regulation of private matter, which the Supreme Court would have to consider if it's a violation of a state's constitutional right to privacy.

But wait, the Supreme Court has found that laws regulating private matters, such as sex, are constitutional if they don't violate the fourth or fifth amendments. So, if the statute is about sex, and it's not in conflict with the Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights, it's okay.

Let me think about the options. Let's go through each option.

Option A: The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. The Supreme Court has the authority to regulate state actions that are not in the state's interest or that violate constitutional rights. So, this doesn't seem correct.

Option B: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes on the men's Ninth Amendment rights. The Ninth Amendment is about free exercise of religion. This law isn't about religion, so maybe not. But maybe the First Amendment rights are at play. The men's rights to life, liberty, or the press are protected. If the law is about sex, it might infringe on their right to privacy. So, maybe B is a possibility, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes on the men's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment protects against equal protection under the law. But this law is about sex, so it's about the same-sex couples, not about equality. So, maybe C is not the case.

Option D: The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment. Again, the law is about sex, not expression. So, D is probably not correct.

Option E: The relationship is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation. Wait, the state's right to privacy is a separate issue. If the law is about sex, it might be a matter of state regulation. The Supreme Court might have considered it in McCulloch or other cases. So, this option is about the right to privacy, which is a different issue. So, maybe E is incorrect.

Option F: The statute is constitutional as it promotes the common good. I don't think that's the case. The law is clearly about the violation of a state's right to regulate sex, which is a serious matter and likely unconstitutional.

Option G: The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process. Again, the right to liberty is the First Amendment, but this is about sex, so this doesn't seem right.

Option H: The statute is unconstitutional as it goes against the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. No, this is about sex and is not about punishment.

Option I: The statute is unconstitutional as it goes against the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. No, same as above.

Option J: The statute is constitutional because it falls within the state's police power to regulate health, safety, welfare, and morals. This is the last option. But the law is specifically about sex and same-sex relations, which are beyond the state's regulatory power. Police can regulate health, safety, etc., but not regulate sexual relations unless it's within their authority. The issue is whether the law infringes on constitutional rights, not whether it's within state powers.

Wait, but the Supreme Court in McCulloch v. Maryland found that a state's regulation of private matters is constitutional. So, if the state's law is regulating state's regulation of private matter (like sex), then it's constitutional. But the Supreme Court hasn't ruled on this in the same context as McCulloch.

Alternatively, the law might be a violation because it's a state regulation of sex, which is beyond the state's powers. But wait, the state law is a state regulation of private matter, which is a matter that the state can regulate. So, the Supreme Court would probably find it constitutional because it's a state regulation of a matter not within its jurisdiction of power, but that's not correct. Because the state's power to regulate includes sex, as in McCulloch. So, the state can regulate sex, so the law would be constitutional.

Wait, but the law is specifically about same-sex couples. So, does that matter? The Court might have held that the law doesn't infringe on the constitutional right to privacy or life, etc.

Wait, the First Amendment's Establishment Clause forbids the government from establishing religion. But this isn't about religion. The law is about sex, which is a private matter regulated by state law. So, the issue is whether the state's law is a violation of constitutional rights, like the right to privacy or press freedom.

For example, if the law regulates the private matter of sex, it could be considered a violation of the state's right to privacy, which is a constitutional right. So, that would support option E, which says the relationship is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to criminal regulation.

But wait, the Supreme Court in Everson v. City of New York, held that laws regarding sex education are constitutional, as they don't conflict with the Establishment Clause. So, that's a case where the state law isn't about religion but about sex. So, perhaps the same logic applies here.

In Everson, the Court upheld sex education laws, which were seen as a form of religion. So, the law is about sex, but it's not violating the Establishment Clause. It's about a matter the state can regulate. So, perhaps the Supreme Court would find that the law is constitutional because it's a state regulation of a matter not within the state's jurisdiction, but that's not correct. The state has the power to regulate sex, so the law would be constitutional.

Wait, but the options don't present that. Let me look at the options again.

The options are about the constitutional basis for the law's application. So, the law could be seen as a state regulation of a matter that the state can regulate. So, the question is whether the law violates constitutional rights, like the right to privacy.

But the options:

E says the relationship is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to state criminal regulation.

Wait, is the right to privacy a factor here? The right to privacy is a constitutional right. The law is about sex, so if the law is about the private matter of sex, it's a matter the state can regulate, so the state can't infringe on the right to privacy. So, the law doesn't violate the right to privacy, which would support an option that says it's constitutional as it's a state regulation. So, looking at the options, option E says the relationship isn't protected by the right to privacy and is subject to criminal regulation.

Wait, but option E says the statute is constitutional because it's within the state's police power to regulate health, safety, etc. But that's not correct because the law is about sex, not about health or safety. So, perhaps E is incorrect.

Another angle: the law prohibits same-sex couples from having mutual sexual relations. So, perhaps it infringes on the right to privacy, because the law could be seen as targeting individuals who have engaged in sexual relations, thereby potentially infringing on their privacy rights.

Wait, but the law is against same-sex couples. So, if the state is imposing a law that targets two people who have engaged in mutual sexual relations, it's not about an individual's privacy. It's about the conduct of two individuals. So, that might not directly infringe on the right to privacy. Privacy rights are about individuals, not about the conduct of pairs. So, perhaps option E is incorrect.

Alternatively, the law could be seen as targeting the conduct, which, in some contexts, could be a violation of privacy. But in this case, it's about mutual sexual relations between two people, so perhaps it's not about each individual's privacy.

Wait, but the law is about "deviate sexual intercourse," which refers to two individuals engaging in such relations. So, the law's application could be seen as targeting individuals who have engaged in such relations, which may infringe on their privacy. But the law is about mutual relations, not individual conduct.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think about the options.

The options are:

A: The federal constitution can't be used to interfere. Unlikely because the state has the authority.

B: It infringes on the Ninth Amendment rights. Doesn't fit, since this is about sex.

C: It infringes on the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. Doesn't fit.

D: It infringes on freedom of expression. No.

E: Not protected by the right to privacy and subject to criminal regulation. Hmm.

F: Contributes to promoting the common good. Unrelated.

G: Violates the right to liberty. Unlikely.

H: Violates the Eighth Amendment. Unlikely.

I: Violates cruel punishment. Unlikely.

J: Conforms within police power. Unlikely.

So, the most likely option is E or perhaps J. But J's reasoning is about police power, which might not be correct since the law is about sex, not about law enforcement.

Option E says the right to privacy isn't protected and that it's subject to criminal regulation. But according to the cases I'm thinking about, this law would be constitutional because it's a state regulation of a matter the state can regulate. So, the state can regulate sex, so the law is constitutional. So, perhaps the correct holding is that the statute is constitutional because it's a state regulation.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think: the state law is a regulation of a matter outside its jurisdiction, but I'm not sure. The state can regulate sex, so the law is constitutional. So, perhaps the answer is E, but I'm not certain.

Wait, option E says the relationship isn't protected by the right to privacy and is subject to criminal regulation. So, if the law is about mutual same-sex relations, it's not about individual privacy. So, perhaps the right to privacy isn't violated. So, the statute is constitutional as it doesn't infringe on the rights. Therefore, the statute is constitutional because it's a state regulation of a matter the state can regulate, and it doesn't infringe on constitutional rights like privacy.

Alternatively, the Supreme Court might have held that the law infringes on the right to privacy because it's about the conduct of individuals, but perhaps the conduct is considered a private matter, and the state can regulate it.

Wait, a similar case to Everson comes to mind. In Everson, the Court upheld sex education laws as constitutional because they didn't violate the Establishment Clause. So, sex education isn't about religion, but it's about a matter the state can regulate. So, perhaps the same logic applies here.

In this scenario, the law is about same-sex couples having mutual sexual relations. So, it's a matter the state can regulate. Therefore, the law is constitutional because it doesn't violate the constitutional rights of the people, such as the right to privacy.

So, the holding would be that the statute is constitutional because it's a state regulation of a matter within its jurisdiction (as in, it's a matter the state can regulate, not necessarily a matter it can't). So, the correct answer would be that the statute is constitutional because it's a state regulation.

Looking at the options, option E says the relationship is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to state criminal regulation. So, if the law is about the conduct of two people, it's not about individual privacy, so it's not protected by the right to privacy. So, E might be the correct option.

Alternatively, another possibility: since the law is about same-sex couples, it's a matter the state can't regulate because it's about individuals rather than pairs. But that doesn't align with the common law approach, where a state can regulate a matter it can regulate.

Wait, the Supreme Court has found that the state has the authority to regulate sex, so the law is constitutional. So, in the options, the correct reasoning would be that the law is constitutional because it's a state regulation, so it's not violating any constitutional rights.

Looking back at the options, the only one that makes sense is E. Because if the law is about same-sex couples, it's not directly about the privacy of each individual, so the right to privacy isn't violated. Therefore, the statute is constitutional because it's a state regulation, and it's not infringing on constitutional rights like the right to privacy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Another approach: the law is about same-sex couples having mutual sexual relations. So, it's a matter that the state has the authority to regulate. Therefore, the law is constitutional because it's a state regulation. So, the correct answer is that it's constitutional as it's a state regulation, so the right to privacy isn't violated.

Looking at the options, E says it's not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to criminal regulation. That sounds correct if the law is about the conduct of two individuals, it's not about each individual's privacy. So, E would be the holding.

Another point: the Court would find that the law doesn't infringe upon any constitutional rights because it's about a matter the state can regulate, not about religion, press freedom, etc.

The question revolves around the constitutional authority of a state law that prohibits same-sex individuals from having mutual sexual relations. The key issue is whether this law violates constitutional rights, such as the right to privacy and the Establishment Clause. The analysis considers the constitutional framework and relevant legal precedents.

1. **Key Elements of the Law**: The law is a state regulation of sex, specifically targeting same-sex couples engaging in mutual sexual relations. It is a matter the state can regulate, as seen in cases like McCulloch v. Maryland, where state regulation of private matters is upheld as constitutional.

2. ** constitutional Rights Considerations**:
   - **Right to Privacy**: The law does not directly infringe on the right to privacy, as it is not about the privacy of individuals but about the conduct of pairs. Therefore, E's claim that the right to privacy is not protected is correct.
   - **Right to Freedom of Expression**: This law does not target individual freedom of expression but rather the regulation of private matters.
   - **Right to Life, Liberty, and Press Freedom**: These rights are not violated, as the law does not infringe on them.

3. **Implications of the Law**: The law is a state regulation of a matter the state can regulate, which aligns with the Supreme Court's precedent in cases like McCulloch v. Maryland. This reasoning supports the idea that the law is constitutional.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option E**: Correct. The law is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to criminal regulation. The state can regulate sex, and the law does not infringe on constitutional rights.

ANSWER: E
