Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a rubber ball bouncing after being dropped from a height. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says the ball is dropped from 4 feet. Each time it bounces, it loses 10% of its energy due to friction and compression. I need to find out after how many bounces the ball will only rise 2 feet. The options are from A to J, with varying numbers like 2,3,4... up to 11.

Hmm, let's think about energy loss. When the ball bounces, it loses some energy. Specifically, 10% of its energy is lost each time. So, each bounce after that, the ball doesn't have 10% of its previous height. Wait, no, the energy loss affects the height it reaches. So, if it loses 10% of energy, that might mean it doesn't reach 10% higher than before. Or maybe it's the opposite. Let me clarify.

Energy is directly related to the height because the potential energy (PE) is mgh. So, if the ball loses 10% of its energy, the remaining energy is 90% of what it had before. So, the next bounce's maximum height would be 90% of the previous height. Because PE is proportional to height. So each bounce, the height is multiplied by 0.9.

Wait, but in reality, energy loss isn't always 100% loss. The problem says it loses 10% of its energy, so each bounce, the ball reaches 90% of the previous height. So, the height after each bounce is 0.9 times the previous one.

So, the initial drop is 4 feet. Then, the first bounce would be 4 * 0.9 = 3.6 feet. The second bounce would be 3.6 * 0.9 = 3.24 feet. And so on.

I need to find the smallest number of bounces where the height is less than or equal to 2 feet.

So, let's model this. Let h be the height after each bounce. The initial drop is 4, but that doesn't count as a bounce. So, each bounce is a reduction of 10% of the energy, leading to 90% of the height.

So, the height after n bounces is h(n) = 4 * (0.9)^n.

We need to find the smallest integer n where h(n) ≤ 2.

Let me set up the inequality:

4 * (0.9)^n ≤ 2

Divide both sides by 4:

(0.9)^n ≤ 0.5

Now, take natural logs on both sides:

ln(0.9^n) ≤ ln(0.5)

n * ln(0.9) ≤ ln(0.5)

Since ln(0.9) is negative, dividing both sides will reverse the inequality:

n ≥ ln(0.5)/ln(0.9)

Let me compute that.

Compute ln(0.5) ≈ -0.6931
Compute ln(0.9) ≈ -0.10536

So, the ratio is (-0.6931)/(-0.10536) ≈ 6.579.

So, n must be at least 6.579. Since n must be an integer, the next whole number is 7.

Wait, but let me check:

Calculate (0.9)^6:

0.9^1 = 0.9

0.9^2 = 0.81

0.9^3 = 0.729

0.9^4 = 0.6561

0.9^5 = 0.59049

0.9^6 = 0.531441

0.9^7 = 0.4782969

So, after 6 bounces, the height is about 0.531441 *4 = 2.125764 feet, which is more than 2. After 7 bounces: 0.4782969 *4= 1.9131876 feet, which is less than 2.

Wait, but the question says the ball is dropped from 4 feet, and each bounce causes it to rise to 90% of the previous height. So, the first bounce is 3.6 feet, which is 4 *0.9. Second is 3.24, which is 3.6 *0.9. So, the first bounce is 4 *0.9, second 4*(0.9)^2, etc.

So, the height after n bounces is 4*(0.9)^n.

Wait, but is it 4*(0.9)^n or 4*(0.9)^(n-1)?

Wait, let's clarify. The initial drop is 4 feet, which doesn't count as a bounce. The first bounce is when it hits the ground and bounces back to 3.6 feet, which is 4 *0.9. So, each bounce n has a height of 4*(0.9)^n. So, for n=0, it's 4 feet (the initial drop, before any bounce). Then n=1 is 3.6, n=2 is 3.24, etc.

Wait, no. Let's model it correctly. Each bounce after the drop. So, when it's dropped from 4 feet, it bounces. The first bounce reaches 3.6 feet. Second bounce 3.24 feet, etc.

So, the height after each bounce is 4 * 0.9^1, 4 * 0.9^2, etc.

So, the height after n bounces is h(n) = 4*(0.9)^n.

We need h(n) ≤ 2.

So, 4*(0.9)^n ≤ 2 → (0.9)^n ≤ 0.5.

Taking natural logs: n ≥ ln(0.5)/ln(0.9) ≈ (-0.6931)/(-0.10536)≈6.579 → n=7.

So, 7 bounces. So the answer should be 7 bounces, which is option D.

Wait, but the options include F:4, G:2, H:5, I:11, J:9, etc. So, the correct option is D:7.

The problem involves a rubber ball that loses 10% of its energy with each bounce due to friction and compression, resulting in 90% of the previous height after each bounce. The ball is initially dropped from 4 feet, and we need to determine the number of bounces required for it to rise to a maximum height of 2 feet.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Loss and Height Relationship**: Each bounce reduces the ball's height by 10%, meaning the ball reaches 90% of its previous height after each bounce. Thus, the height after \( n \) bounces is given by:
   \[
   h(n) = 4 \times (0.9)^n
   \]

2. **Inequality Setup**: We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
   \[
   4 \times (0.9)^n \leq 2
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 4:
   \[
   (0.9)^n \leq 0.5
   \]

3. **Logarithmic Calculation**: Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   \ln(0.9^n) \leq \ln(0.5)
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   n \times \ln(0.9) \leq \ln(0.5)
   \]
   Since \( \ln(0.9) \) is negative, dividing both sides reverses the inequality:
   \[
   n \geq \frac{\ln(0.5)}{\ln(0.9)} \approx \frac{-0.6931}{-0.1054} \approx 6.579
   \]

4. **Rounding**: Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 7.

5. **Verification**: Calculating \( (0.9)^7 \approx 0.478 \), so \( 4 \times 0.478 \approx 1.913 \) feet, which is less than 2 feet. Thus, the ball will only rise to 2 feet after 7 bounces.

### Correct Answer:
The correct option is **D: 7 bounces**.
