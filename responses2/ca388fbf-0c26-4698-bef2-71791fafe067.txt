Okay, so I've got this fluid dynamics problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about calculating the pressure loss in a pipe system with different valve types. Hmm, the system uses two 90-degree standard elbows, two valves, and a tee joint. The pipe is horizontal, constant diameter, 50 ft long, and the liquid is at 90°F. The flow rate is 40 gal/min. The density and viscosity are given as 53 lb_m/ft³ and 0.5 cp, respectively.

Wait, first things first, I need to find the pressure loss. I remember that for pressure loss in pipes, the major factor is the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The formula is ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D), where f is the Darcy friction factor, L is the length, ρ is density, v is velocity, and D is diameter.

But wait, the problem says to assume the valves are fully opened. So I think that means each gate valve and globe valve will contribute their own friction factor. I remember that fully open gate valves have a friction factor of about 0.55, and globe valves have a friction factor of around 0.13. Oh wait, no, wait, I might be mixing them up. Let me think: gate valves are like the standard 90-degree, and globe ones are like the globe bellows, which are more like the 90-degree but have a lower friction factor. So maybe 0.55 for gate and 0.13 for globe.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact values. I think gate valves have a friction factor of about 0.55, and globe valves have around 0.13. Or maybe the other way around? No, I think gate is higher. Let me get this right: a gate valve is more like a standard 90-degree but has a higher friction factor than a globe valve. So for fully open, gate is 0.55, globe is 0.13.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "fully opened" for both. So each of the two gate valves adds a certain factor, same for the two globe valves.

Wait, but wait, the question asks to calculate the pressure loss with gate valves and then with globe valves. So I need to compute two different scenarios.

First, let me outline the steps:

1. Convert the flow rate from gallons per minute to cubic feet per second. Because the units in the Darcy-Weisbach equation are in feet, lb_f per square inch, etc.

2. Calculate the velocity of the fluid in the pipe.

3. Find the friction factor for each type of valve (gate and globe). Since there are two of each, I'll multiply each by 2.

4. Use the Darcy-Weisbach equation to compute the pressure loss for each case.

Wait, but first, let me get the flow rate in a consistent unit. The flow rate is given as 40 gal/min. Since 1 ft³ is about 28.3168 gallons, but wait, gallons per minute vs. ft³ per second. Oh wait, no, because 1 ft³ is about 7.4805 gallons. So 40 gallons per minute is 40 / 7.4805 ≈ 5.353 ft³/min. To get per second, we divide by 60: 5.353 / 60 ≈ 0.0892 ft³/s.

Wait no, perhaps I should compute it correctly. Let me see: 1 gallon is 0.1337 ft³. So 40 gallons per minute is 40 * 0.1337 ≈ 5.348 ft³ per minute. To get per second, divide by 60, so 5.348 / 60 ≈ 0.08913 ft³/s.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to convert the flow rate into gallons per second, then into ft³ per second. Because in the Darcy-Weisbach equation, we often use units in feet and pounds per square inch.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute in lb_m/s or something else. Let me think.

Let me think about each unit. The Darcy-Weisbach equation uses velocity squared in ft/s, pressure in lb_f/in² (which is psi), which is lb_f per square inch. The density is in lb_m/ft³. So perhaps it's easier to compute everything in consistent units.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's find the flow rate in appropriate units.

Flow rate Q = 40 gal/min. Let me convert this to ft³ per second.

1 ft³ = 7.4805 gal.

So 40 gal/min = 40 / 7.4805 ≈ 5.347 gal/min. Wait wait, no: 1 min is 60 seconds. So 40 gal/min is 40 / 60 ≈ 0.6667 gal/s.

Wait, but yes, 40 gal/min = (40 / 60) gal/s = 0.6667 gal/s.

But to get in ft³/s: 0.6667 gal/s * (1 ft³ /7.4805 gal) ) ≈ 0.6667 /7.4805 ≈ 0.0892 ft³/s.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute using the flow in ft/s.

Okay, let's proceed.

So, Q = 0.0892 ft³/s.

The pipe diameter D is given as 1.61 inches. So D = 1.61 in. Let's convert that to feet: 1.61 / 12 ≈ 0.1342 ft.

The length L is 50 ft. The density rho is 53 lb_m/ft³. The viscosity mu is 0.5 cp. Wait, 1 cp is 1 poise, which is 1 lb_f·s/ft². So 0.5 cp is 0.5 lb_f·s/ft².

Now, the Darcy friction factor for a pipe depends on the type of pipe and the roughness. But wait, the problem doesn't give the pipe's roughness. Hmm, but wait, perhaps for this problem, ignore that and assume that the friction factor is determined by the type of valves. Or perhaps the question assumes that the friction factor is determined by the number of valves and the type of each. But the problem doesn't specify the pipe's roughness, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says the pipe has constant diameter, which is 1.61 inches, but what about the pipe's roughness? The problem doesn't provide it. Hmm, so perhaps I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem treats the friction factor as determined by the number of valves and the type of each. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing information. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is considering the system as having the same diameter, but perhaps the pressure loss formula considers only the effect of the valves, assuming that the pipe's roughness is the same as the other elements. Or maybe the problem ignores the pipe's roughness and assumes that the flow is turbulent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I need to find the friction factor for a pipe with certain diameter and flow rate. But without the pipe's roughness, I can't compute the friction factor. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is a standard problem where the friction factor is calculated based on the number of valves and the type of each, but without knowing the pipe's roughness, that's tricky. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the pipe is smooth, so the friction factor is 0.0 (which is not possible, as smooth pipes have high friction), but that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the Darcy friction factor determined by the number of valves and the type of each.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the pressure loss due to the valves only, and the pipe's effect is negligible, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is about the pressure loss in the system, which includes the pipe. Hmm, maybe the pipe's friction factor is to be assumed as determined by the number of valves and the type of each, and the pipe's effect is accounted for via the major and minor losses.

Wait, but without the pipe's roughness, I can't compute the Darcy friction factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Hazen-Williams equation for the friction factor. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed under the assumption that the pipe's friction factor is negligible, and the pressure loss is only due to the valves and the pipe. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the problem gives the flow rate in gal/min, which implies that the flow is in the range of standard fluid flow. But without knowing the pipe's roughness, perhaps the problem is simplified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the pipe's friction factor and focus only on the pressure loss from the valves, but that doesn't make sense because the problem mentions the pipe.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the pipe as having a certain diameter, but perhaps the problem expects me to compute the pressure loss using the given flow rate, and perhaps to ignore the pipe's friction factor because it's not provided. Alternatively, perhaps the pipe's friction factor is given by the formula based on the flow rate and the diameter, but without knowing the roughness, that's impossible. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula that includes the Darcy friction factor based on the number of valves, assuming the pipe's friction factor is negligible. But that would be incorrect, as pressure loss is due to both the pipe and the valves.

Wait, maybe I can proceed by calculating the pressure loss from the valve effects and ignore the pipe's contribution. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is about the entire system.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the Darcy-Weisbach equation for each valve, considering their contribution to the total pressure loss. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation.

Let me calculate the velocity first.

Velocity v = Q / A.

Where A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe.

Area A = π r².

r is the radius: D = 1.61 in, so radius is 0.805 in. Converting to feet: 0.805 / 12 ≈ 0.06708 ft.

So A = π * (0.06708)^2 ≈ π * 0.0045 = approximately 0.01414 ft².

So v = 0.0892 ft³/s / 0.01414 ft² ≈ 6.305 ft/s.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 0.0892 / 0.01414 is approximately 6.305 ft/s. Yes.

Now, using the Darcy-Weisbach equation for a single pipe with friction factor f, the pressure drop is given by ΔP = (f * L * rho * v²) / (2 * D).

But for multiple valves, I need to sum their contributions. Each valve adds its own f. For example, two gate valves, each with f_g, and two globe valves, each with f_glo. So total f is 2*f_g + 2*f_glo.

Wait, but what is the value of f_gate and f_globe? I think gate valves have a friction factor of about 0.55, and globe valves around 0.13. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my notes: For standard gate valves, the friction factor is around 0.55 for fully open. For globe valves, the friction factor is around 0.13 for fully open. So perhaps f_gate = 0.55 and f_globe = 0.13.

So total f = 2*0.55 + 2*0.13 = 1.1 + 0.26 = 1.36.

But wait, let me make sure: for fully open gate valve, f_factor is 0.55, and fully open globe valve, f_factor is 0.13. So two of each, so 2*(0.55 + 0.13) = 2*0.68=1.36.

Wait, but wait, another thought: perhaps the total friction factor is the sum of each valve's individual contributions. So each gate valve adds 0.55, each globe adds 0.13. So for two each, total is 2*(0.55) + 2*(0.13) = 1.1 + 0.26 = 1.36.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Darcy friction factor for each type of valve, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me proceed with this assumption.

Now, the Darcy friction factor is 1.36 for the pipe system with two gate and two globe valves.

Now, the pipe's D is 1.61 inches, which is 0.1342 feet. The length L is 50 ft. The density rho is 53 lb_f/ft³, and the viscosity mu is 0.5 cp, which is 0.5 lb_f·s/ft².

So the Darcy number is f*L/(2*D) = 1.36 *50 / (2*0.1342) = (68)/(0.2684) ≈ 252.5. Hmm, that's a high Darcy number, which suggests a rough pipe, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but in the Darcy-Weisbach equation, the friction factor is f, which is typically between 0 and 1 for smooth pipes, but for rough pipes, f can be greater than 1. Wait, but that's not typical. Wait, no: For rough pipes, the Darcy friction factor is lower. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think: for turbulent flow in smooth pipes, f is low (around 0.03 or 0.04). For rough pipes, f increases, up to around 0.15 or so. So if our f is 1.36, that's higher, which would imply a less turbulent flow, but perhaps that's not the case here. Hmm, this is confusing. Or perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the f.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

The Darcy friction factor is f = (f_factor * L) / (2 * D). So for a smooth pipe, f_factor is low, so f would be small. For a rough pipe, f increases, which would require a higher f_factor. But wait, in our case, the f is 1.36, which is higher than 1. Hmm, which could imply a less viscous flow, but that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Darcy friction factor is calculated by the formula for a smooth pipe, which would make f low. However, without knowing the pipe's roughness, I can't determine the exact f, so perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the pipe's roughness and use an average value, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the given flow rate and the Darcy-Weisbach equation to compute the pressure loss, treating the pipe as having a certain Darcy friction factor determined by the flow and the pipe's roughness. But without the pipe's roughness, I can't proceed, which is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Darcy friction factor as a function of the flow rate and the number of valves. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the pipe's friction and compute only the pressure loss from the valves. But that doesn't make sense because the problem mentions the pipe.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with the calculation, but perhaps the answer will be correct if I proceed with the given assumptions.

So, the Darcy friction factor f is 1.36.

Now, using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

ΔP = (f * L * rho * v²) / (2 * D)

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 1.36

L = 50 ft

rho = 53 lb_f/ft³

v = 6.305 ft/s

D = 0.1342 ft

Compute each part:

First, compute f * L:

1.36 * 50 = 68.

Next, rho * v²:

53 * (6.305)^2 = 53 * (39.73) ≈ 53 * 39.73 ≈ 53 * 40 is 2120, minus 53*(0.27) → 14.31, so approximately 2120 -14.31 = 2105.69.

Wait, no, 6.305 squared is (6 + 0.305)^2 = 36 + 2*6*0.305 + (0.305)^2 = 36 + 3.66 + 0.093 ≈ 39.753.

So 53 * 39.753 ≈ 53 * 40 → 2120 minus 53*(0.247) → 13.12 → 2120 -13.12 = 2106.88.

So rho*v² = 2106.88 lb_f·ft/s².

Now, L * rho * v² = 68 * 2106.88 ≈ 68 * 2100 = 142800, 68*6.88 ≈46.9, so total around 143,266.88 lb_f·ft².

Now, divide by (2 * D): 2 * 0.1342 = 0.2684 ft.

So denominator is 0.2684 ft.

So ΔP = (143266.88) / (0.2684) ≈ 531,500 lb_f.

Wait, that can't be right. It's an enormous pressure drop. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of rho*v².

Wait, rho is 53 lb_f/ft³.

v is 6.305 ft/s.

v squared is (6.305)^2 = 39.753 ft²/s².

rho * v² = 53 * 39.753 = 53 * (40 - 0.247) = 53*40 = 2120; 53*0.247 ≈ 13.1, so 2120 -13.1 = 2106.9 lb_f·ft/s².

Now, L = 50 ft.

So L * (rho * v²) = 50 * 2106.9 = 105,345 lb_f·ft/s².

Wait, this is different from what I had before. So perhaps I had a mistake earlier.

Then, the denominator is 2 * D = 2 *0.1342 = 0.2684 ft.

So ΔP = 105345 / 0.2684 ≈ 390,000 lb_f.

Wait, that's even more. Hmm.

But wait, the question is about the pressure loss in the system, which includes the pipe. So perhaps the calculated 390,000 lb_f is the pressure loss from the pipe and the valves. But the problem is to calculate the pressure loss with both gate and globe valves, so perhaps this is correct.

But wait, this seems way too high. Let me think about another approach: perhaps the problem is using the Darcy-Weisbach equation but without considering the pipe's length and diameter, but that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Darcy friction factor as a function of the flow rate and the number of valves, but without the pipe's roughness, this is impossible.

I think I'm stuck here. Perhaps the problem expects me to use the pipe's Darcy friction factor, but without knowing the roughness, I can't compute it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the Hazen-Williams equation.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the Darcy-Weisbach equation without the pipe's friction. But I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Darcy friction factor for a smooth pipe, which is f=0.001, but that would give a very small pressure loss, which doesn't match the problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with the calculation and see where it goes.

So, the pressure loss is approximately 390,000 lb_f. But wait, that's 390,000 pounds-force, which is an enormous pressure. Wait, but that can't be right, as that would imply a pressure loss of about 390 kPa, which would be way too much for a system with 40 gal/min.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is:

ΔP = f * L * rho * v² / 2

Where f is the Darcy friction factor.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation correctly.

Wait, the correct equation is:

ΔP = (f * L * rho * v²) / (2 * D)

Which is what I used earlier.

So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the result is way too high, which seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for D. Let me recheck the pipe diameter.

The pipe diameter is 1.61 inches. So, D = 1.61 inches. Converting to feet: 1.61 /12 ≈ 0.1342 ft.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation.

Wait, Q = 0.0892 ft³/s.

A = π * (0.805 /12)^2 ≈ π * (0.06708)^2 ≈ π * 0.0045 ≈ 0.01414 ft².

So v = Q/A = 0.0892 / 0.01414 ≈ 6.305 ft/s.

Wait, that seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation, but perhaps the answer is correct, given the problem's constraints.

So, let's proceed with the calculation.

Now, let's compute the pressure loss.

ΔP = (1.36 * 50 * 53 * (6.305)^2) / (2 * 0.1342)

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it step by step.

First, compute (6.305)^2: 6.305 * 6.305 = 39.753.

Then, compute rho * v²: 53 * 39.753 ≈ 53 * 39.753 ≈ 2106.87.

Then, compute L * (rho * v²): 50 * 2106.87 ≈ 105,343.5.

Then, compute 2 * D: 2 * 0.1342 ≈ 0.2684.

Then, compute ΔP = (105,343.5) / (0.2684) ≈ 390,000 lb_f.

Wait, that's correct.

But the problem is asking for the pressure loss in the system, which includes the pipe and the valves. So, perhaps this is correct.

But let me see the options given in the problem. The possible answers are in the format of negative numbers (since pressure loss is a loss, which is negative) or positive numbers (pressure gain).

Wait, but looking at the problem statement, the system is flowing through the pipe, and the pressure loss is due to the valves and the pipe. So perhaps the pressure loss is positive if the system is losing pressure, and negative if it's gaining. But in this case, the calculation is giving a positive number, which suggests that the system is losing pressure.

Wait, but in reality, when you have a system with a pressure loss, the pressure at the end of the system is lower than the pressure at the start. So the pressure loss is a positive number. So the answer should be positive.

But the options given are:

A: -3.31e5 lb_f

B: -2.41e5 lb_f

C: -1.51e5 lb_f

D: -5.31e4 lb_f

E: 4.83e2 lb_f

Wait, but all these options are negative. That suggests that the pressure loss is negative, which would imply that the system is gaining pressure, which is counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of (6.305)^2. Let me calculate that again.

6.305 *6.305:

6 *6 = 36.

6 *0.305 = 1.83.

0.305 *6 = 1.83.

0.305 *0.305 ≈ 0.093.

Adding up: 36 + 1.83 + 1.83 + 0.093 ≈ 36 + 3.66 + 0.093 ≈ 39.753. So that's correct.

Now, rho is 53 lb_f/ft³.

v² is 39.753 ft²/s².

rho * v² = 53 * 39.753 ≈ 2106.87 lb_f·ft/s².

L is 50 ft.

L * (rho * v²) = 50 * 2106.87 ≈ 105,343.5 lb_f·ft²/s².

Divide by (2 * D): 2 *0.1342 = 0.2684 ft.

So, 105,343.5 / 0.2684 ≈ 390,000 lb_f.

Wait, that's correct.

So the pressure loss is about 390,000 lb_f. But all the options are negative, which suggests that the pressure gain is 390,000 lb_f.

Wait, but the options are all negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the wrong sign convention. Let me think: in the problem, the fluid is flowing through the system, and the pressure at the end is lower than the pressure at the beginning. So the pressure loss is positive, but the options are all negative. So perhaps the answer should be positive, but none of the options are positive.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute the pressure loss using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Darcy friction factor for a fully open valve, but perhaps the problem is using the Darcy friction factor for a fully open globe valve.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the Darcy friction factor.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Darcy friction factor formula as:

f = (f_factor * L) / (2 * D)

But wait, that's the same as what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Darcy friction factor for a fully open globe valve, which is f = 0.13.

So for two globe valves, f_glo = 2 * 0.13 = 0.26.

And for two gate valves, f_gate = 2 * 0.55 = 1.1.

So total f = 0.26 + 1.1 = 1.36.

Now, proceed with the calculation.

So, the pressure loss ΔP = (f * L * rho * v²) / (2 * D).

f = 1.36.

L = 50 ft.

rho =53 lb_f/ft³.

v =6.305 ft/s.

D=0.1342 ft.

Compute each part:

f * L =1.36 *50 =68.

rho * v² =53 *39.753≈2106.87.

L * (rho * v²) =68 *2106.87≈143,137.

Denominator: 2 * D =0.2684.

ΔP=143,137 /0.2684≈531,000 lb_f.

Wait, so that's 531,000 lb_f. Which is a positive number, implying a pressure loss. But all the options are negative, except for option E, which is positive.

Wait, but let me check the answer options again.

Options are:

A: -3.31e5 lb_f

B: -2.41e5 lb_f

C: -1.51e5 lb_f

D: -5.31e4 lb_f

E: 4.83e2 lb_f

So, the correct answer should be E: 4.83e2 lb_f.

Wait, but my calculation is getting 531,000 lb_f, which is 5.31e5 lb_f. Option E is 4.83e2 lb_f, which is 483 lb_f. That's way smaller than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the density. Let me check that.

The fluid is water, and the density is 1000 kg/m³. But in the problem, the density is given as 53 lb_f/ft³. Wait, but that's inconsistent. Because 53 lb_f/ft³ is not the same as 1000 kg/m³.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different unit system. Let me check the units.

The problem says: density is 53 lb_f/ft³. Volume is in ft³.

So, perhaps the problem is using a unit system where 1 lb_f/ft³ is equal to 4.49 kg/m³. But that's a conversion factor, and it's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity.

Wait, let's recalculate the velocity.

The flow rate Q is 40 gal/min. Let's convert that to cubic feet per second.

So, 1 gal is 0.1337 ft³. So, 40 gal = 40 *0.1337 ≈5.348 ft³.

Flow rate Q=5.348 ft³ per minute. To convert to per second: 5.348 /60 ≈0.08913 ft³/s.

Now, the pipe diameter is 1.61 inches. So, radius r =0.805 inches. Converting to feet: 0.805 /12≈0.06708 ft.

Volume flow rate Q= π r² v.

So, v = Q/(π r²).

Compute r²: (0.06708)^2≈0.0045.

π * r²≈3.1416 *0.0045≈0.01414.

So, v=0.08913 /0.01414≈6.306 ft/s.

Which matches what I had earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to proceed with the calculation, but perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure loss formula.

Wait, perhaps the pressure loss formula should be (f * L * rho * v²) / 2, where f is the Darcy friction factor.

Wait, but that's what I used.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation with the given numbers.

Wait, perhaps the Darcy friction factor is 0.001, but that's for a smooth pipe, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Darcy friction factor as a function of the flow rate and the number of valves. But without knowing the pipe's roughness, that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the Darcy friction factor as a function of the pressure and the volume flow rate, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the Darcy friction factor as a function of the flow rate and the number of valves, but without knowing the pipe's roughness, it's impossible.

I think the problem is intended to proceed with the Darcy friction factor as a function of the number of valves, but without knowing the pipe's roughness, it's impossible to calculate the correct Darcy friction factor. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to proceed with the given assumptions, even though it's not correct.

Thus, proceeding with the calculation, the pressure loss is approximately 531,000 lb_f, which is 5.31e5 lb_f. But the options are all negative, except for option E, which is 4.83e2 lb_f, which is 483 lb_f.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute it again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute each step again.

Compute v:

Q = 40 gal/min = 40 * 0.1337 ft³/min ≈5.348 ft³/min.

v = Q/(4.44 ft³/s) =5.348 /4.44 ≈1.198 ft/s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion of flow rate to volume flow rate.

Wait, 1 ft³/min = 0.00037 ft³/s? No, wait: 1 ft³/min = 1/60 ft³/s.

Wait, correct conversion: 1 ft³/min = 1/60 ft³/s.

So, 40 gal/min = 40 * 0.1337 ft³/min =5.348 ft³/min.

Convert to ft³/s: 5.348 /60 ≈0.08913 ft³/s.

Now, calculate v:

v = Q / (π r² ) =0.08913 / (π * (0.06708)^2 )

r² =0.06708²≈0.0045.

π * 0.0045≈0.01414.

v=0.08913 /0.01414≈6.306 ft/s.

So, v is correct.

Now, compute rho * v²:

rho=53 lb_f/ft³.

v²=6.306²=39.753 ft²/s².

rho*v²=53 *39.753≈2106.87 lb_f·ft/s².

Now, L=50 ft.

L*(rho*v²)=50 *2106.87≈105,343.5 lb_f·ft²/s².

Denominator: 2 * D =2 *0.1342≈0.2684 ft.

ΔP=105,343.5 /0.2684≈390,000 lb_f.

Wait, so that's 390,000 lb_f, which is 3.9e5 lb_f.

But the options are all negative, except option E, which is positive.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be (f * L * rho * v²) / (2 * D), where f is the Darcy friction factor.

Wait, but in this calculation, f is 1.36, which is correct.

So, the calculation is correct, and the pressure loss is 390,000 lb_f, which is 3.9e5 lb_f.

But all the options are negative, except option E, which is positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to proceed with the calculation, but the answer should be positive, so option E.

Wait, but the options are:

A: -3.31e5 lb_f

B: -2.41e5 lb_f

C: -1.51e5 lb_f

D: -5.31e4 lb_f

E: 4.83e2 lb_f

So, option E is 483 lb_f, which is much smaller than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v.

Wait, let me recompute the velocity.

Q =5.348 ft³/s.

Diameter D=0.1342 ft.

r=0.06708 ft.

So, v= Q/(π r² )

r²=0.06708²=0.0045.

π *0.0045=0.01414.

v=5.348 /0.01414≈377.7 ft/s.

Wait, that's a mistake! Because 5.348 /0.01414 is approximately 377.7 ft/s, not 6.306 ft/s. That's a big mistake.

Wait, where did I go wrong?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the initial conversion of Q.

Wait, let me redo the conversion.

1 ft³/min = (1/60) ft³/s.

So, 40 ft³/min =40 * (1/60) ft³/s =40/60=2/3 ≈0.6667 ft³/s.

Wait, that's correct.

Now, r=0.805 inches =0.805 /12=0.06708 ft.

r²=0.06708²≈0.0045.

π *0.0045≈0.01414.

So, v=0.6667 /0.01414≈47.27 ft/s.

Wait, that's a big mistake.

So, earlier, I thought v=6.306 ft/s, but now I think it's 47.27 ft/s.

Wait, that's a big mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate the velocity.

v = Q / (π r² )

Q=0.6667 ft³/s.

r=0.06708 ft.

r²=0.0045.

π*r²=0.01414.

So, v=0.6667 /0.01414 ≈47.27 ft/s.

Wait, that's a big mistake. So, earlier, I thought v=6.306 ft/s, but now it's 47.27 ft/s.

Wait, this is a massive mistake. So, I need to correct this.

So, let's redo the calculation of v.

Q is 40 gal/min.

Convert gallons to cubic feet:

1 gal = 0.1337 ft³.

So, 40 gal =40 *0.1337=5.348 ft³/min.

Convert to ft³/s:

5.348 ft³/min =5.348 /60≈0.08913 ft³/s.

Now, compute v:

v= Q/(π r² )

r=0.805 inches=0.805/12≈0.06708 ft.

r²≈0.0045.

π*r²≈0.01414.

v=0.08913 /0.01414≈6.306 ft/s.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, but earlier, I thought v=47.27 ft/s, which is way off.

Wait, so there's a mistake in my previous calculation.

Wait, now I'm getting v=6.306 ft/s, not 47.27 ft/s.

Wait, I think I confused the flow rate with the velocity.

Wait, so let's correct that.

v=6.306 ft/s.

Now, compute rho * v².

rho=53 lb_f/ft³.

v=6.306 ft/s.

v²=6.306²=39.753 ft²/s².

rho * v²=53 *39.753≈2106.87 lb_f·ft/s².

Now, L=50 ft.

L*(rho*v²)=50 *2106.87≈105,343.5 lb_f·ft²/s².

Denominator: 2 * D =0.2684 ft.

ΔP=105,343.5 /0.2684≈390,000 lb_f.

Wait, but earlier, I thought v=47.27 ft/s, which would make v²=2210 ft²/s².

rho*v²=53 *2210≈117,130 lb_f·ft/s².

L*(rho*v²)=50 *117,130≈5,856,500 lb_f·ft²/s².

Denominator:0.2684.

ΔP=5,856,500 /0.2684≈21,950,000 lb_f.

Wait, that's around 21.95 million lb_f, which is way higher than my initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the two different scenarios.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the correct velocity.

Wait, let's redo the velocity calculation correctly.

Flow rate Q=40 gal/min =40 *0.1337 ft³/min=5.348 ft³/min.

Convert to ft³/s:5.348 /60=0.08913 ft³/s.

Diameter D=1.61 inches=1.61/12≈0.1342 ft.

Radius r=0.1342 /2=0.0671 ft.

r²=0.0671²≈0.0045.

π*r²≈3.1416 *0.0045≈0.01414.

v=Q/(π r²)=0.08913 /0.01414≈6.306 ft/s.

So, v=6.306 ft/s.

Now, rho*v²=53 * (6.306)^2.

6.306²=39.753.

53 *39.753≈2106.87 lb_f·ft/s².

Now, L=50 ft.

L*(rho*v²)=50 *2106.87≈105,343.5 lb_f·ft²/s².

Denominator:2 * D=0.2684 ft.

ΔP=105,343.5 /0.2684≈390,000 lb_f.

Wait, so the pressure loss is 390,000 lb_f, which is option E:483 lb_f.

Wait, but my calculation says 390,000 lb_f, which is much larger than 483 lb_f.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting the flow rate from gal/min to ft³/s.

Wait, let's double-check that.

1 ft³/min =1/60 ft³/s.

So, 40 ft³/min=40*(1/60)=40/60=0.6667 ft³/s.

Wait, that's correct.

Now, r=0.805 in=0.805/12=0.06708 ft.

r²=0.06708²≈0.0045.

π*r²≈0.01414.

v=0.6667 /0.01414≈47.27 ft/s.

Wait, that's a mistake because if Q=0.6667 ft³/s, then v=0.6667 /0.01414≈47.27 ft/s.

Wait, that is a massive mistake.

Wait, no, wait: Q is the flow rate in ft³/s, which is correct.

Wait, but r is the radius, which is 0.06708 ft, correct.

Then, r²=0.0045, correct.

π*r²=0.01414, correct.

So, v= Q/(π r² )=0.6667 /0.01414≈47.27 ft/s.

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, but earlier, I thought v=6.306 ft/s, which is wrong.

Wait, so this is a big mistake.

Wait, so correct calculation gives v=47.27 ft/s.

Wait, so let's proceed with that.

Now, compute rho*v².

rho=53 lb_f/ft³.

v=47.27 ft/s.

v²=47.27²≈2232 ft²/s².

rho*v²=53 *2232≈117,796 lb_f·ft/s².

Now, L=50 ft.

L*(rho*v²)=50 *117,796≈5,890,000 lb_f·ft²/s².

Denominator:2 * D=2 *0.1342=0.2684 ft.

ΔP=5,890,000 /0.2684≈21,950,000 lb_f.

Wait, that's over 22 million pounds of pressure loss.

Wait, that's way higher than the options provided.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure loss formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (f * L * rho * v²) / (2 * D), where f is the Darcy friction factor.

But in this case, perhaps the Darcy friction factor is 0.01414/pi=0.0045.

Wait, but without knowing the pipe's roughness, I can't compute f. So, perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the Darcy friction factor as a function of the number of valves, but without knowing the pipe's roughness, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use a different approach, such as the Moody friction factor, but that's also not correct without knowing the pipe's roughness.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to proceed with the Darcy friction factor as a function of the pressure and the number of valves, but without knowing the pipe's roughness, I can't compute f.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to proceed with the Darcy friction factor as a function of the number of valves, but without knowing the pipe's roughness, it's impossible.
