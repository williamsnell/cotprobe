Question:

A heavyset man with long red hair robbed a liquor store. Thereafter, a man was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the man's trial, the owner of the liquor store was called to testify. He admitted that he was unable to identify the man, who now had a shaven head, as the robber. The prosecuting attorney then handed the owner six photographs. He proposed to testify, over defense objections, that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, admittedly a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was a picture of the person who robbed his store. The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged

Options:

A: admissible as a prior identification by the witness.
B: inadmissible, due to the potential for bias or suggestion.
C: admissible as past recollection recorded.
D: admissible, as it is the owner's personal account of the event.
E: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.
F: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
G: inadmissible, as it is based on a photograph and not a live lineup.
H: admissible, as it provides critical evidence for the case.
I: inadmissible, because the owner failed to identify the man in court.

Okay, so I've got this law question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about evidence law, specifically regarding evidence admissibility. I remember that evidence rules are important in criminal law, and each has specific criteria.

The scenario: A man with long red hair robs a liquor store. Then, a man is arrested and charged with armed robbery. The store owner is called to testify and says he couldn't identify the man after he shaved his head. The prosecutor gives him six photos. The owner's argument is that one of them, picture #4, was a picture before he shaved his head. He argues that he told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4 was the robber's photo.

The question is whether this evidence is admissible. The options are A to I, with F being the correct answer. But I need to understand why.

So, the key here is the nature of the evidence the owner is presenting. He's using multiple photos to show that he identified the robber before he shaved his head. This seems like a prior identification or identification by a previous statement.

Looking at the options, option A says it's admissible as a prior identification by the witness. I'm a bit fuzzy on what a prior identification entails. From what I recall, prior identification can occur in several ways. One common method is using a photograph that shows a picture before a change, like shaving. Another is the use of past recollection recorded (like mentioning the photo he saw), which is a more indirect method.

So picture #4 is considered a prior identification. So the argument is that the owner used a photo as a prior identification to prove he identified the robber before shaving his head. This is a common method, especially when the change is material—like shaving or a change in appearance.

Option F says it's admissible because it's relevant to the case. That makes sense because the owner is trying to prove he saw the robber before he shaved his head, which is a key piece of evidence in the case.

Option G mentions that it's based on a photograph and not a live lineup. I think prior identification can be evidence, so G doesn't seem right.

Option E is about confrontation, but the owner is presenting the evidence to prove he couldn't identify the robber in court, so he's not presenting it for a witness's gaze. He's using it to show he had a previous identification. So E is probably incorrect.

Option C says it's past recollection recorded, which is another way of saying prior identification. So C and A are both possible, but I think prior identification is a broader term that includes both methods.

So, the owner is using the photos as a prior identification—whether it's a photo or a recollection. So the evidence is admissible. Looking at the options, F says it's admissible because it's relevant. That seems correct.

Other options: A is a possible method, but I think F is the more accurate reason. So the correct answer should be F.

The owner's evidence is admissible because it is relevant to the case. The photograph used to show a prior identification is a key piece of evidence supporting the case. 

Answer: F
