Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the least perfect square with three different prime factors. Hmm, let me think through this.

Alright, I remember that a perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer. So, for example, 4 is 2 squared, 9 is 3 squared, and so on. Now, the question is asking for the smallest perfect square that has three distinct prime factors. 

Wait, three different primes. So the square itself must include three different primes. But wait, when you square a number, how does that affect the exponents of its prime factors? Let me recall: if I have a number N, and it's a product of primes with exponents, say, p^a * q^b * r^c, then N squared would be p^(2a) * q^(2b) * r^(2c). 

So for a number to be a perfect square, each of these exponents must be even. But wait, the question is about a perfect square with three different prime factors. So, the number itself (the square) should have three different primes in its prime factorization.

Wait a second, but when you square a number, the exponents are doubled. So, if the original number has exponents a, b, c for the primes p, q, r, then the square would have exponents 2a, 2b, 2c. So, for the square to have three different primes, the original number just needs to have those primes, but the exponents would need to be such that when multiplied by two, they are even. Well, since 2 times any integer is even, that's automatically satisfied. So, any number that's a product of three different primes raised to the first power would, when squared, have each exponent doubled, making them even. So, the square would be a perfect square with those primes as factors.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose N is the product of three different primes, p, q, r, each to the power of 1. So N = p * q * r. Then N squared is (pqr)^2, which is p² q² r². That's a perfect square, and it has three different prime factors. So the smallest such number would be the product of the three smallest primes.

The three smallest primes are 2, 3, and 5. So, 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. Then 30 squared is 900. But wait, 900 is one of the options, option A. But wait, wait a second—that can't be right. Because 30 squared is 900, which is 2² * 3² * 5². But that's just a perfect square with three different primes. But wait, 900 has three different primes, but is that the least perfect square with three different primes? Because maybe there's a smaller number.

Wait, but 2*3*5 is 30. So 30 squared is 900. Let me check the options. Option A is 900. But wait, there's another option, D: 484, which is 22 squared. Hmm, wait, 22 squared is 484. Let's factor 484. 22 is 2*11, so 22 squared is (2*11)^2 = 2² * 11². So that's a perfect square with two different primes (2 and 11), but wait, the question asks for three different primes. Oh, because 2² *11² is 484, which is a square but only has 2 and 11 as primes. So that's two primes, not three. So D is a square of a number with two primes, so it doesn't meet the criteria.

Wait, then what about 100? Option F is 100. 100 is 10 squared. 10 is 2*5, so 100 is 2² *5². Again, only two primes. So F is 100, which is 2 and 5 squared. So that's two primes, not three.

Option G is 9, which is 3 squared. Only one prime. So that's not enough.

Option I is 225, which is 15 squared. 15 is 3*5, so 225 is 3² *5² again, only two primes. So no.

Option J is 666. Let's factor that. 666 divided by 2 is 333. 333 divided by 3 is 111, which is 37*3. So 666 is 2*3²*37. So that's three different primes (2,3,37). So 666 squared would have those primes each squared, but 666 itself is a square? Wait, no, 666 is not a square. Because 25² is 625, 26² is 676. So 666 isn't a square. So 666 squared would be a square, but 666 itself is not a square. So 666 squared is a square, but the question is about a perfect square with three different primes. Wait, but 666 squared is (2*3²*37)^2 = 2² *3^4 *37². So that's a perfect square, but it has three different primes: 2,3,37. So that's a candidate. But wait, is 666 the least? Because 900 is 30², which is 2² *3² *5². So 900 is a perfect square with three different primes. But 666 is smaller than 900. So why is 666 an option? Because 666 is a perfect square? No, I think I made a mistake. 666 is not a perfect square. Because 25² is 625, 26² is 676, so 666 is in between, so it's not a square. So 666 squared is a square, but 666 itself is not. So the question is about a perfect square that has three different prime factors. So 666 squared is a perfect square, but it's 2² *3^4 *37². So that's a perfect square with three primes, but 666 is not a perfect square. So the question is about the perfect square, so the number itself (the square) must be a perfect square. So 666 squared is a square of 666, but 666 is not a square. So 666 squared is (666)^2, which is a square, but 666 is the number whose square is considered. So the number itself (666) is not a square, so the square of it would be (666)^2. But wait, the question is, what is the least perfect square with three different primes. So the perfect square would have 3 primes. So, for example, 900 is 30 squared, which is (2*3*5)^2. So, 900 is a square with primes 2,3,5. So 900 is a candidate. Now, is there a smaller number?

Wait, 22 squared is 484, which is 2² *11². So that's (2*11)^2. So that's a square with two primes, not three. So 484 is not an option because it's not a square with three primes.

Wait, 30 squared is 900. Is that the least? Let's see if there's a smaller number. What about 12 squared? 12 is 2² *3, so 12 squared is 2^4 *3². That's a square, but it only has two prime factors, 2 and 3. So that's not enough.

What about 15 squared? 15 is 3*5, so squared is 3² *5². Again, two primes. So that's not enough.

Wait, 21 squared is 441. 21 is 3*7, so squared is 3² *7². Again, two primes. So 441 is 3²*7². So that's two primes, so not three.

Wait, what about 18 squared? 18 is 2*3², so squared is 2² *3^4. So that's a square with two primes, 2 and 3.

Hmm, what about 10 squared, which is 100. 10 is 2*5, so squared is 2² *5². Again, two primes.

Wait, what about 22 squared is 484, which is two primes. 25 squared is 625, which is 5^4. So one prime.

Hmm, so the next possible number after 30 is 30. So 30 squared is 900. But wait, are there any numbers between 100 and 900 whose squares have three different primes?

Wait, another approach: the square of a number with three different primes would require the number to be the product of those three primes. So, the smallest such product is 2*3*5=30. So 30 squared is 900. 30 is the smallest number that has three different primes. But wait, 30 is the product of 2,3,5. So its square is 900, which is a perfect square with three different prime factors.

Wait, but wait another point. Let's think, 666 is not a perfect square, so 666 squared is (666)^2, which is a square, but 666 itself is not. So that's not the number we're looking for. The question is about the least perfect square with three different prime factors. So, the perfect square has three different primes in its factors.

So, for example, the square of 30 is 900, which is a perfect square with three different primes. But wait, is there a smaller number? Because 30 squared is 900, but wait, are there any numbers smaller than 30 whose square is a perfect square with three different primes?

Wait, no, because 30 is the smallest product of three different primes. Because 2,3,5 are the first three primes, and 2*3*5 is 30. So the square of 30 is 900.

Wait, wait another thought. 49 is 7 squared. That's one prime. 121 is 11 squared, another single prime. So that won't help. How about 22 squared, which is 484, which is two primes. So 484 is out.

So the next is 900. So 900 is the square of 30, and 30 has three different primes. So that's the least.

Wait, but wait—could a smaller square have three different primes? Let me check the options given:

Options are A:900, B:441, C:300, D:484, E:529, F:100, G:9, H:25, I:225, J:666.

Wait, 300 is option C. Let me see: 300 is 2² *3 *5². So its prime factors are 2,3,5. So 300 is a square number? Wait, no, because 300 is 2² *3^1 *5². So the square root would be 2*sqrt(3)*5, which is not an integer, so 300 is not a square. So 300 is not a perfect square. So, the next option is 441, which is 21², 21 is 3*7. So 441 is 3² * 7². That's two primes, so not three.

Option D is 484, which is 22², which is (2*11)², so 2² *11². Again, two primes. So that's not three.

Option E is 529. 529 is 23², which is prime. So 23 squared is a square with only one prime.

Option F is 100, which is 10 squared, 2² *5². Again, two primes.

Option G is 9, which is 3 squared. Only one prime.

Option I is 225, which is 15², 15 is 3*5. So 225 is 3² *5². Two primes.

Option J is 666, which is 666. As I thought earlier, it's not a perfect square because 25² is 625, 26² is 676, so 666 isn't a square. So 666 isn't a square. So 666 squared would be a square, but 666 itself isn't. So the question is about the square having three different primes. So 666 squared is (666)^2, which is a square, and 666 is 2*3*3*37. So 666 squared is (2*3*37)^2, which is 2² *3² *37². So that's a square with three primes: 2,3,37. But 666 is not a square itself, so 666 squared is a square, but 666 is not. So J is not a candidate because 666 is not a square. So it's not a square number, so it doesn't fit the question.

So the options left are A:900, which is 30 squared (2*3*5), with three primes. Are there any other options with a square that's a perfect square with three primes and a smaller value?

Wait, I think 30 squared is 900, which is the smallest possible. Let's see the next possible number: 30 is 2*3*5, so its square is 900. Wait, what about 15 squared? 15 is 3*5, so 15 squared is 225, which is 3² *5². Two primes. So that's not enough.

Wait, wait. What about 2*3*5 is 30, but what if there's a smaller number, maybe a composite with three primes but smaller than 30? Like 2,3,5 is 30, but any other combination with smaller primes would be even smaller. For example, 2,3,2 is 12, but that's not three different primes. Wait, no, 2,3, and another prime like 5 is the first three.

So 30 is the smallest number with three different primes. Its square is 900, which is the least perfect square with three different primes.

Wait, but wait—another thought: maybe 2*3* something smaller. Like, 2*3* something smaller than 5? But the primes are 2,3,5,7, etc. So 5 is the third prime. So 2*3*5 is the smallest product of three different primes, and its square is 900.

So the correct answer is A:900.

The least perfect square with three different prime factors is 900, which is the square of 30 (the product of the smallest three primes: 2, 3, and 5).
