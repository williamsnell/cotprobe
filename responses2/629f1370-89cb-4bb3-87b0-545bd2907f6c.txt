Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about greedy algorithms. Let's see what I remember. The question is asking which of the given problems can be solved using a standard greedy approach. There are three options: I, II, III. The answer choices are A to J, each giving a different combination.

First, let me recall what a greedy algorithm is. A greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It's simple, but not always correct because the right choice might not lead to the global solution. However, some problems do have greedy solutions.

The question has three problems:

I. Finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights.

Hmm, I remember Krusky's algorithm, which is a greedy method for finding a minimum spanning tree. It sorts all edges by weight and adds them in order, avoiding cycles. So this should be possible with a standard greedy approach.

II. Finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph.

Maximum clique is a problem where you're looking for the largest complete subgraph. I think that's not a problem that can be solved greedily. I recall that finding cliques is an NP-hard problem, and for large graphs, it's computationally intensive. Greedy approaches for cliques don't guarantee the optimal solution because the choice made early might affect later choices. So I don't think this can be solved with a standard greedy algorithm.

III. Finding a maximum flow from a source to a sink in a directed graph with positive-integer capacities.

Yes, I'm pretty sure the Ford-Fulkerson method or more advanced algorithms like Dinic's do this. Both are greedy algorithms. They work by finding augmenting paths and increasing flow until no more augmenting paths exist. So this is definitely a standard greedy approach.

Now, looking at the options:

A: None of the above. Well, I and III are correct, so A is wrong.

B: III only. But I also thought I was correct, so B is wrong.

C: I, II, III. But II is not feasible, so C is incorrect.

D: III and II but not always I. Wait, but I was right that I works, so D is incorrect.

E: I and II but not always III. Oh wait, no, III is correct, so E is wrong.

Wait, I thought I was correct. So let me check the options again.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: I and II, but not always III. But since III is definitely correct, E is wrong.

Option B: III only. But I also thought I was correct, so B is incorrect.

Wait, the correct options are I and III. So looking back at the options, is there any option that includes I and III?

Looking at the options provided:

Option B: III only (so no I)
Option D: III and II but not always I (II is wrong)
Option E: I and II but not always III (II wrong)
Option F: I and II only (no III)
Option G: II only (no I)
Option H: II and III only (no I)
Option J: I and III only (that's what I thought)

So the correct answer should be option J. But wait, the options don't have an option with J as the correct answer. Let me look again.

The user provided the options as:

A: None of the above
B: III only
C: I, II and III
D: III, and II, but not always I
E: I and II, but not always III
F: I and II only
G: II only
H: II and III only
I: I only
J: I and III only

So, the correct answers are I and III. Looking for an option that includes both I and III. None of the options have both except option J. So the correct answer is J: I and III only.

Wait, but wait, I thought I works, but let me make sure. Oh right, the problem is about which can be solved by a standard greedy approach. So I and III are correct, II is not. So the correct choice is J.
</think>

The correct answer is J: I and III only.

Step-by-step explanation:

- **Problem I**: Minimum spanning tree can be found using a greedy algorithm (e.g., Kruskal's or Prim's), so it is solvable by a standard greedy approach.
- **Problem II**: Finding a maximum clique is NP-hard and a greedy approach cannot guarantee an optimal solution, so it is not solvable by a standard greedy algorithm.
- **Problem III**: Maximum flow can be found using the Ford-Fulkerson method, which is a standard greedy algorithm.

Thus, the correct options are I and III, which corresponds to option J. 

Answer: J
