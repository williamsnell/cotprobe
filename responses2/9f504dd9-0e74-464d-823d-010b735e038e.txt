Okay, so I have this question here about an element ejecting an alpha particle and what happens to the mass number of the resulting element. Hmm, I remember that alpha particles are helium nuclei, right? So they have a mass of 4 atomic mass units and a charge of +2. 

Wait, when an element emits an alpha particle, it's undergoing alpha decay. I think that means the element emits an alpha particle (He nucleus) and turns into another element. How does that affect the mass number? Let's think about the reaction. 

The general form is: Parent nucleus + alpha particle → daughter nucleus + other particles (like neutrinos maybe? But I don't think they affect mass number). So in terms of mass number, the parent plus the alpha (mass 4) equals the daughter plus any other changes. 

Wait, but in the reaction, the parent's mass number plus the alpha's (which is 4) would equal the daughter's mass number plus any changes from other particles. But wait, no, the other particles might include electrons or something, but those are part of the overall atom. Wait, no, the mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons. So in the reaction, the parent element (Z) emits an alpha (which is 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so A increases by 4). So the parent's A is A_parent. The alpha has A=4. The daughter's A would be A_parent - 4, right? Because when you eject the alpha, you lose 4 in mass number. 

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, in the reaction, the mass number is conserved except for the emitted particles. But in alpha decay, the daughter is the element, and the alpha is emitted. So the parent's mass number plus the alpha's 4 must equal the daughter's mass number plus any other particles. But in the case of alpha decay, the only other particles are the alpha, so the parent's A + 4 = daughter's A. So daughter's A is parent's A minus 4. 

So the mass number decreases by 4. Let me think about an example. Let's say I have Carbon-12 (A=12). If it emits an alpha, it becomes a new element. The new element would have A=12-4=8. Which element is that? Oxygen. So Carbon (A=12) → Oxygen (A=8) via alpha emission. That makes sense. 

So when an element emits an alpha particle, its mass number decreases by 4. So the correct answer should be F: reduces by 4. 

Looking at the options, option F is 'reduces by 4.' So the answer is F.

When an element ejects an alpha particle, it undergoes alpha decay. Alpha particles are helium nuclei, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, giving them a mass number of 4. The parent nucleus emits an alpha particle and transforms into a daughter nucleus. The mass number of the parent nucleus is equal to the mass number of the daughter nucleus plus the mass number of the alpha particle minus any emitted particles. In this case, the daughter nucleus is the resulting element, and the alpha particle is ejected. Since the parent nucleus loses 4 units of mass (the mass number of the alpha particle), the mass number of the resulting element decreases by 4.

The correct answer is F: reduces by 4.
