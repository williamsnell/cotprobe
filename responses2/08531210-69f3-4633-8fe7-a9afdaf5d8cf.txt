Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an athlete whirling a discus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on circular motion, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So the athlete is whirling the discus in a circle with a radius of 80.0 cm. Wait, the radius is in centimeters, but the answer needs to be in m/s². Oh right, I should convert that radius to meters. So 80 cm is 0.8 meters. Got it.

At a certain instant, the angular speed is 10.0 rad/s, and the angular acceleration is increasing at 50.0 rad/s². I need to find the magnitude of the acceleration. The options are given, but I don't want to look at them right away, I should work it out.

I remember that when an object is moving in a circle, there are two components of acceleration: tangential and centripetal. The tangential acceleration is due to changes in the angular speed, and the centripetal acceleration is due to the change in direction of the velocity, which makes it perpendicular to the tangential acceleration.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the angular speed is increasing at a rate. So that's the angular acceleration. So I think the centripetal acceleration is given by ω² r, where ω is the angular speed and r the radius. And the tangential acceleration is α r, where α is the angular acceleration.

The total acceleration is the vector sum of these two. But since they are perpendicular, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude. So the total acceleration a = sqrt( (a_tangential)^2 + (a_centripetal)^2 ).

Let me compute each part.

First, a_tangential = α * r. α is 50 rad/s², r is 0.8 m. So 50 * 0.8 = 40 m/s². That part's straightforward.

Next, a_centripetal = ω² * r. ω is 10 rad/s, so 10 squared is 100. Multiply by r 0.8 m: 100 * 0.8 = 80 m/s². Oh wait, wait, wait, let me double-check the units. The radius is in meters, angular speed in rad/s, so when I square ω, the units become (rad/s)^2 * m. Rad is dimensionless, so yes, the units are m/s².

So a_tangential is 40 m/s², a_centripetal is 80 m/s².

Now, the magnitude of the total acceleration is the square root of the sum of the squares of these two. So sqrt(40² + 80²) = sqrt(1600 + 6400) = sqrt(8000) = what's that?

Hmm, sqrt(8000) equals sqrt(8 * 1000) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(1000) = approx 2.828 * 31.623. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, 8000 is 8 * 10^3, but wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Wait, 8000 is 8 * 1000, and 1000 is 10^3. Alternatively, 8000 is 8 * 10^3, but what's sqrt(8000)?

Alternatively, factor 8000 as 100 * 80. Because 100 * 80 is 8000. So sqrt(100 * 80) = 10 * sqrt(80). Now, sqrt(80) is sqrt(16 * 5) = 4 * sqrt(5) ≈ 4 * 2.236 = 8.944. So 10 * 8.944 is 89.44 m/s².

Wait, but wait, what's sqrt(8000) exactly? Let me compute it more accurately. 89.44 squared is (approx 90^2 is 8100), so 89.44 * 89.44 ≈ 8000. So yes, the square root is about 89.44. So approximately 89.4 m/s².

Looking at the options, option C is 89.4, which is what I got. But wait, wait, let me check if I added correctly. 40 squared is 1600, 80 squared is 6400. 1600 +6400=8000. Square root of 8000 is approximately 89.44, so yes, option C is correct.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, a_tangential = alpha * r = 50 * 0.8 =40. Correct.

a_centripetal = omega^2 r = (10)^2 *0.8=100*0.8=80. Correct.

Adding squares: 40^2=1600, 80^2=6400. Sum is 8000. Square root is 89.44 m/s². So the answer must be 89.4, which is option C.

To determine the magnitude of the acceleration of the discus, we analyze the circular motion by breaking it into two components: tangential and centripetal. The tangential acceleration arises from changes in angular speed, while the centripetal acceleration is due to the change in direction of the velocity.

### Given:
- Radius of the circular path: \( r = 80.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.8 \, \text{m} \)
- Angular speed: \( \omega = 10.0 \, \text{rad/s} \)
- Angular acceleration: \( \alpha = 50.0 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \)

### Step 1: Calculate the tangential acceleration
The tangential acceleration is given by:
\[
a_{\text{tangential}} = \alpha \cdot r
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
a_{\text{tangential}} = 50.0 \cdot 0.8 = 40 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the centripetal acceleration
The centripetal acceleration is given by:
\[
a_{\text{centripetal}} = \omega^2 \cdot r
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
a_{\text{centripetal}} = 10.0^2 \cdot 0.8 = 100 \cdot 0.8 = 80 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the magnitude of the total acceleration
Since the tangential and centripetal accelerations are perpendicular, the magnitude of the total acceleration is found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
a_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{a_{\text{tangential}}^2 + a_{\text{centripetal}}^2}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
a_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{40^2 + 80^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 6400} = \sqrt{8000}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the square root
The square root of 8000 can be simplified as:
\[
\sqrt{8000} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 80} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{80} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{16 \cdot 5} = 10 \cdot 4 \cdot \sqrt{5} = 40 \cdot \sqrt{5}
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \):
\[
a_{\text{total}} \approx 40 \cdot 2.236 = 89.44 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
The calculated value of \( 89.44 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) matches option **C: 89.4**.
