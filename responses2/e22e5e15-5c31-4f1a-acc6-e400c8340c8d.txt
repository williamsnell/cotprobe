Okay, so I've got this question about a saw manufacturer. Let me try to figure it out. The question says the manufacturer can make a saw for $13 in direct costs and $10 in overhead or indirect costs. They need to sell it at a minimum price to avoid a short-term loss. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Hmm, I remember that to break even, the selling price should cover all the costs. So, the total cost would be the direct costs plus the overhead. Wait, direct costs are the direct materials and labor, right? So here, it's $13. Then overhead is $10. So total cost is 13 + 10 = $23. So he needs to sell it at least $23 to break even.

Wait, but the question is about not incurring a short-term loss. A short-term loss would mean he's not covering his costs. So, he needs to sell it above the break-even point. So the minimum price without loss would be just above $23. But the options are specific, so let me check.

Looking at the options: A is $35, B is $25, C is $28, D is $30, E is $18, F is $23, G is $10, H is $15, I is $20, J is $13.

Wait, J is $13, which is the direct cost. But that's just covering the direct cost, not considering overhead. So that's probably too low. The question is about manufacturing a saw, so the overhead is part of the cost as well.

So the break-even is $23. So he needs to sell it for at least $23. So the minimum price is $23. So the answer would be F: $23.

Wait, the question is phrased as "minimum price so he won't incur a short-term loss." So the minimum price is $23. So the correct answer is F.

The manufacturer needs to cover his total costs of $13 (direct) + $10 (overhead) = $23. To avoid a short-term loss, he must sell at or above this amount. The correct answer is F: $23.

Answer: F
