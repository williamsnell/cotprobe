Okay, so I've got this question here about insurance policies. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question says: Barnes and Sons, Co. insured their offices with an annual premium of $130 on March 3. Then, on October 15, the carrier canceled the policy. The question is asking what the refund due them would be. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that when a policy is canceled, the refund depends on when the policy was first used. If it was used within the same policy year, the refund is usually the full premium. But wait, sometimes there's an exclusion clause if the policy was canceled before the policy expired.

Wait, in this case, the policy was for an annual amount, so the policy probably runs for a year. March 3 is the start date. The policy was canceled on October 15. So, how many days have passed since the policy began? Let me see, March has 31 days, so from March 3 to March 31 is 31-2=29 days (since March 3 is day 1). April has 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and October 15.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of days between March 3 and October 15. Let me think: March 3 to March 31 is 29 days. April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and then October 15. So that's 30 days in April, 31 May, 30 June, 31 July, 31 August, 30 September, and 15 October. Let's add these up:

30 (April) +31 (May)=61, +30 (June)=91, +31 (July)=122, +31 (August)=153, +30 (September)=183, +15 (October)=200 days. Wait, that can't be right because March 3 to October 15 is a long time, but maybe I'm counting wrong. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of days between March 3 and October 15.

Wait, another way: March 3 to March 31 is 29 days. April has 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and October 15. So adding up: 29 (March) + 30 (April) =59, +31 (May)=90, +30 (June)=120, +31 (July)=151, +31 (August)=182, +30 (September)=212, +15 (October)=227 days.

Wait, but that would be 227 days. But wait, that's a lot. But the policy is annual, so the total days in a year is 365. So, 227 days is about 62.5% of the year. But wait, the policy was canceled after the policy started, so maybe the full premium is due?

Wait, but another thing I remember is that if the policy is canceled before it expires, the refund is the full premium. Unless there's an exclusion clause, but I don't think that's the case here. So perhaps the answer is $130.

But wait, let me make sure. If the policy is canceled before the policy expires, the refund is the full amount, which is the annual premium. So the company would refund the entire $130. But wait, another possibility is that if the policy was canceled after the policy started, but before the policy expired, then the refund is the full premium.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the refund is calculated on a prorated basis if the policy was canceled before the policy ended. But in this case, the policy was for an annual amount, so the total coverage is one year. If the policy is canceled on October 15, which is before the end of the year, then the full premium applies.

Wait, for example, if the policy was for a year and was canceled on December 31, the refund is the full $130. If it's canceled before that, like October 15, then the refund is the same. So the answer should be $130, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Some policies have a prorated refund if the policy is canceled before the end of the policy year. But in this case, the policy was for a year, and the term is annual. So I think the refund is the full amount. So the answer would be $130, option A.

The refund due to Barnes and Sons would be the full annual premium of $130, as the policy was canceled before its expiration but within the same policy year. 

Answer: A: $130
