Question:

If households are more optimistic about the future how would the consumption function be affected?

Options:

A: The marginal propensity to consume would decrease, decreasing the slope of the consumption function.
B: The marginal propensity to consume would increase increasing the slope of the consumption function.
C: The marginal propensity to save would increase, decreasing the slope of the consumption function.
D: The marginal propensity to consume would remain the same, keeping the consumption function stable.
E: The entire consumption function would shift to the right.
F: The entire consumption function would shift to the left.
G: The entire consumption function would shift upward.
H: The marginal propensity to consume would decrease increasing the slope of the consumption function.
I: The entire consumption function would shift downward.
J: The marginal propensity to save would decrease, increasing the slope of the consumption function.

Okay, so I've got this economics question about the consumption function and how household optimism affects it. Hmm, I remember that the consumption function shows how much people spend on consumption (C) based on their income (Y). It's typically represented as C = a + bY, where 'a' is autonomous consumption and 'b' is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).

Wait, but I think there's also a marginal propensity to save (MPS) which is the remaining part of income not consumed. Oh right, because MPC + MPS should equal 1, right? So if households are more optimistic about the future, that would influence their current consumption decisions. 

I remember that optimism about the future leads to increased current consumption because people feel more secure. So, their MPC should increase because they are more likely to spend a larger portion of their current income. Let me think: for example, if I'm optimistic about the future, I might save less and spend more on current purchases. So their MPC would go up.

So the consumption function's slope would increase because the MPC is higher. The formula is C = a + MPC * Y. So if MPC increases, the line becomes steeper, meaning a higher slope. Therefore, the slope of the consumption function would increase.

Looking at the options, option B says the MPC increases, which would make the slope of the function higher. Option A says MPC decreases, which would make the line flatter. Option C talks about MPS increasing, which, since MPC + MPS = 1, would mean MPC decreases. So C is incorrect because when optimism increases, MPS would decrease, not increase.

Option D says MPC remains same, which wouldn't happen because optimism leads to higher MPC. So D is wrong. Option E says consumption shifts right. Wait, the consumption function is C = a + bY. If a remains same, and Y increases, then C increases, so the entire function shifts right. But in this case, since MPC increases, the slope is steeper. So yes, the entire function shifts right. So E is a possible correct option.

Wait, but the question is about the impact on the slope. So if the slope is getting steeper, the function shifts to the right because at any given Y, C is higher. So the entire function shifts right. So E is correct.

Option F is the opposite; it would shift left. But that's when MPC decreases, which isn't the case here.

Option G and H mention shifting upward. That would happen if both a and b change, but I think when MPC changes, it affects the slope, not the intercept. So the shift would be in the slope and position.

Wait, but the question is about the slope. So the correct answer should be E. Because with higher MPC, the slope of the function increasesâ€”so the entire line shifts to the right.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, could the entire function shift right because it's a higher MPC? Yes. Because for each Y, you spend more, so the intercept a is same, but the slope is higher. So for example, if Y is 100, and a is 50, the point is 150. But with a higher MPC, say 0.8, same Y, you'd have higher C. So the line shifts to the right.

So the answer should be E: the entire consumption function shifts to the right.

Wait but another thought: If the MPC increases, does the slope increase, so the line is steeper, meaning at each Y, C is higher. So the function shifts to the right. So yes, E is correct.

Looking at the options, option E is 'The entire consumption function would shift to the right.' So that's correct.
</think>

The consumption function is represented as \( C = a + bY \), where \( a \) is autonomous consumption and \( b \) is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). If households are more optimistic about the future, they are likely to increase their current consumption, which raises their MPC. This results in the consumption function having a higher slope because the MPC is greater than 0. The entire consumption function shifts to the right, meaning that for any given level of income, consumption is higher than before. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. If MPC decreases, the slope would decrease, not increase.
- **Option B**: Correct. If MPC increases, the slope of the consumption function increases.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. If MPS increases, it would imply that MPC decreases, which contradicts the assumption of increased optimism.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. If MPC remains the same, the function's slope would not change.
- **Option E**: Correct. If households are more optimistic, the entire consumption function shifts to the right.
- **Option F**, **G**, **H**, **I**, and **J**: Incorrect. These options either describe shifts in the function (E) or incorrect relationships between MPC and the slope.

The correct answer is **E**: The entire consumption function would shift to the right.
