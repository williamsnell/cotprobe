Okay, so I have this question about why children adjust well when they're separating from their parents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what research says is most related to successful adjustment after a divorce. The options are A to J, each giving a different factor. I remember that when a child is in a relationship, things are usually smoother. But after a divorce, there's a lot of uncertainty and possible changes in the family dynamics.

Let me go through the options one by one. Option A says the quality of parent-child relationships before the divorce. That makes sense because if the parents were happy and working well together, the child might adjust more easily. But the question is about adjusting after the divorce, so maybe this is more about the initial relationship, not the adjustment itself.

Option B is about post-divorce conflict. Wait, conflict might indicate a problem, not necessarily how the child will adjust. If the parents are still fighting, it might make it harder for the child to adjust. So this seems related but I'm not sure if it's the best answer.

Option C is academic performance prior. I thought that academic performance could play a role, but I'm not certain. Maybe if the child was doing well academically before, they'd be more motivated to adjust. But I'm not sure this is the main factor.

Option D is frequency of contact with noncustodial parent. Noncustodial parents might be more involved or have a different relationship. More frequent contact could help the child adjust, especially if they're trying to get used to a new environment. That sounds plausible.

Option E is gender of the child. I'm pretty sure gender can play a role, but does it affect adjustment post-divorce? I'm not sure. Maybe more boys or girls might adjust differently, but I don't think this is the primary factor.

Option F is socio-economic status. The parents' economic background could affect child development. Maybe a better background helps the child understand the divorce better, but again, not the main reason for adjustment difficulties.

Option G is remarriage of the custodial parent. That's interesting. If the parent who's separating remarries, maybe there's more support or changes in the environment, which could help the child adjust. But I'm not certain if this is commonly cited as a factor.

Option H is the number of siblings. More siblings might make the process easier for the child, but I don't think that's the main factor for adjustment after a divorce.

Option I is the age of the child at the time of the divorce. Younger children might have more time to adjust since they're still learning. But older children might have more experience, which could affect how they adjust.

Option J is the child’s ability to understand the cause of the divorce. This seems relevant because if the child can't grasp why the divorce happened, they might not be able to adjust well. Understanding the cause is crucial for their emotional and behavioral adjustments.

Putting it all together, I think the key factor is the child's ability to understand the cause of the divorce. That makes sense because if a child doesn't know why it happened, they might not feel the same way after the divorce, making adjustment challenging. So the correct answer should be J.
