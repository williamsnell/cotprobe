Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this cash disbursement for June purchases for Star Co. Let's see what the question says.

The question gives me some financial data from Star Co.'s June budget. The key numbers are sales, cost of goods sold, beginning and ending inventory, and accounts payable for purchases for the beginning and end of the month.

So, the main task is to determine the amount Star should budget for cash disbursements for June purchases. Hmm, cash disbursements for purchases usually involve the accounts payable changes. Because the accounts payable figure tells us how much the company has yet to pay for its purchases. So, the December 31st accounts payable is $75,000. That means in June, the company made purchases that are not paid until December. 

Wait, but in the June budget, the accounts payable starts at $85,000 (June 1) and ends at $75,000 (June 30). So, the company paid $85k at the beginning and $75k at the end. But to find the total cash disbursements for June purchases, I need to calculate the purchases made in June and then see how much was paid in cash versus what's still in accounts payable.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem is asking for cash disbursements for June purchases. So, the cash disbursement would be the purchases made, minus the accounts payable that still need to be paid in the next period. Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the cash payments.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The cash disbursements for purchases would be the purchases made (which is the accounts payable at the end of June, but that seems off because accounts payable typically represent the amount owed for previous purchases). Wait, perhaps I should think about the difference between the beginning and ending accounts payable.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The beginning accounts payable was $85,000 for June 1. The ending is $75,000 for June 30. So, the company paid $85,000 at the beginning but paid $75,000 at the end. So, the total cash payments would be $85,000 (from the beginning) plus the amount paid at the end. But wait, that's not right because the accounts payable at the end is the amount owed for the purchases made during the month.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total purchases made during June. To find that, we can use the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the changes in inventory.

Wait, the COGS is $300,000. The formula for COGS is beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. So, COGS = (beginning inventory) + purchases - (ending inventory).

So, rearranging, purchases = COGS + ending inventory - beginning inventory.

So, plugging in the numbers: 300,000 + 180,000 - 150,000 = 330,000. So, purchases during June were $330,000.

Wait, but wait. So, the company made $330,000 in purchases. Now, how much was paid in cash for these purchases?

Looking at the accounts payable: the beginning was $85k, and the end was $75k. So, the total payments made during June would be the accounts payable at the end of June, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Wait, in June, the company needs to pay for June purchases. So, the beginning of June was 85k, meaning that as of June 1, they had an outstanding account payable of 85k. Then, during June, they made purchases which would be paid in part at the end of June.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the cash disbursements as the purchases minus the accounts payable for the next month. Because the accounts payable at the end of June is the amount owed for June purchases, which would be paid in July. So, the cash disbursements for June would be the purchases made in June, minus the accounts payable for June 30.

Wait, no. Let me think about it differently. The accounts payable at the end of June is $75,000. That means that in June, the company paid $75,000 towards the purchases made in June. Because the accounts payable at the end is what's due next.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

In June, the company starts with $85k in accounts payable. That means that they had to pay $85k at the beginning of June. Then, during June, they make purchases that are still unpaid, and at the end, that's when they pay the remaining.

Wait, maybe I should model it as:

At the beginning of June, they have an account payable of $85k. So, that's what they need to pay at the start.

Then, during June, they make some purchases. Let's say they made X dollars in purchases. Then, at the end of June, their accounts payable is $75k, which is the remaining amount they have to pay.

So, the cash payments for June would be the beginning account payable plus the net purchases paid during June, minus the ending account payable.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The total purchases made during June are equal to (beginning inventory + purchases) minus ending inventory, which we already found as $330,000. But wait, the beginning inventory is 150k, ending is 180k, so the increase is 30k. Since COGS is 300k, which is 300k = 150k + p - 180k → 300k = (150k - 180k) + p → 300k = -30k + p → p = 330k. So, purchases were 330k.

Now, how much of that 330k was paid in cash during June? Well, the beginning account payable was 85k. So, at the beginning of June, they had to pay 85k. Then, during June, they made purchases of 330k, and at the end of June, the accounts payable is 75k.

So, the cash paid during June would be:

- The beginning accounts payable (85k) because that's the amount they had to pay at the start.

- Plus, the purchases made during June that were not yet paid. So, the 330k purchases minus the ending accounts payable of 75k. That's because 75k are still owed at the end, so 330k -75k = 255k. But wait, wait. Let me think: The beginning accounts payable is 85k. During June, the company pays for some purchases, and then at the end, the remaining is 75k. So, the total cash paid during June is:

85k (beginning) + (purchases made during June) minus 75k (ending). But I think another way is: The cash disbursements would be the purchases made (330k) minus the accounts payable at the end (75k) because that's the part that's paid in June.

Wait, no. Because the accounts payable at the end is the amount owed for the purchases made in June. So, the cash paid out during June would be the beginning accounts payable plus the purchases made during June minus the ending accounts payable.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

Cash payments during June = ( Beginning accounts payable ) + ( purchases made during June ) - ( ending accounts payable )

Wait, but that doesn't quite add up. Let me think: The company has to pay the beginning accounts payable at the start of June. Then, during June, they make purchases, some of which are paid in June. The remaining is owed at the end.

So, the cash outflow for June would be:

Cash outflow = ( beginning accounts payable ) + ( purchases made during June ) - ( ending accounts payable )

Wait, but that would be 85k + (330k) -75k = 340k, which is 340,000. Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options except maybe one.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are A:310k, B:320k, and so on. So 340k isn't an option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another approach: The cash disbursements for purchases would be the payments made towards paying the accounts payable. So, the beginning accounts payable was 85k. That means, the company needs to pay 85k in cash during June. Then, during June, the company makes purchases that are paid off in cash, and the remaining is the end accounts payable.

Wait, perhaps the cash disbursements for June purchases would be the payments made towards the accounts payable. So, the beginning accounts payable is 85k. So, the cash disbursements would be 85k (beginning) plus (purchases made during June) minus the end accounts payable (75k). But wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, but perhaps that's not correct because the purchases made during June would include both cash and accounts payable. Because when you make a purchase, you either pay cash or pay accounts payable.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The purchases made during June would be: the beginning inventory plus purchases (330k) minus ending inventory (180k) = 330k -180k = 150k. So purchases of 150k.

Wait, but how much of that 150k is paid in cash during June? The beginning accounts payable is 85k, which is the cash needed to pay off the beginning balance. Then, during June, the company makes 150k in purchases. So, perhaps the cash disbursements for June purchases would be:

85k (to pay off beginning accounts payable) + (150k -75k) (the purchases made during June that are paid in cash) = 85k +75k = 160k. Hmm, but that's not among the options either.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the problem again.

The question is about cash disbursements for June purchases. So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the cash needed to pay for June purchases, which would be the accounts payable at the end of June plus the beginning accounts payable, minus the ending accounts payable.

Wait, no. Wait, the cash disbursements would be the beginning accounts payable plus the payments made in the middle of the month (which might not be helpful here) or perhaps it's the accounts payable at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the cash disbursements are the purchases made during June, minus the accounts payable at the end. That would be 330k (purchases) -75k (ending) = 255k. But that's not an option.

Wait, but let me think about it another way. The company's cash disbursements for June purchases would be the cash they paid during the month. The accounts payable at the end is 75k, meaning that at the end of June, they have to pay 75k in accounts payable. So, the cash disbursements for June purchases would be the beginning accounts payable plus the purchases made during the month minus the ending accounts payable.

Wait, that would be 85k (beginning) + (purchases made during June) -75k.

Wait, but purchases made during June are 330k.

So, 85k +330k =415k. Then minus 75k → 340k.

But 340k is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the cash disbursements for June purchases are the payments made for June's purchases, which would be the beginning accounts payable plus the purchases made during the month minus the ending accounts payable.

So, beginning accounts payable is 85k. So, in June, the company pays 85k in cash towards their June purchases. Then, during June, they have purchases of 330k, and the end accounts payable is 75k. So, the cash paid during June is 85k (to cover the beginning) plus 330k -75k =255k. So, total cash disbursements would be 85k +255k =340k. But again, 340k isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

A:310k

B:320k

C:260k

D:340000 (which is 340k)

E:280k

F:380k

G:300k

H:350k

So, D is 340k, which is what I calculated here, but the options don't have 340k as an answer, except for D.

But wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, 340k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the purchases. COGS is 300k, which is beginning inventory (150k) + purchases - ending inventory (180k) → 300k =150k +p -180k → p = 300k +30k =330k.

So, purchases were 330k.

Now, the cash disbursements for June would be the beginning accounts payable (85k) plus the purchases made during June (330k) minus the ending accounts payable (75k). So, 85k +330k =415k. Then minus 75k → 340k.

So, the cash disbursements would be 340k, which is option D.

But wait, another way to think is that the accounts payable at the end represents the amount owed for June purchases, which would be paid in July. So, in June, the company paid 75k towards the purchases, so the cash disbursements would be the purchases made during June plus the beginning accounts payable, minus the ending accounts payable.

Wait, but that would give 330k (purchases) +85k (beginning) -75k (end) = 330+85-75= 330+10=340k. So same result.

But the options have 340k as D.

Wait, but looking at the options, D is 340k. So the correct answer should be D.

But wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The question is about cash disbursements for June purchases. So, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but wait, looking at another approach, the cash disbursements for June purchases would be the payments made in June, which is the beginning accounts payable (85k) plus the purchases made during June (330k) minus the ending accounts payable (75k) → 85k +330k =415k minus 75k → 340k. So, that's 340k, which is D.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the correct answer might be 320k because I didn't account for something. Let me recheck the accounts.

Wait, perhaps the cash disbursements are only the purchases that are paid during June, not the beginning accounts payable. Because the accounts payable at the beginning is 85k, which might not have been paid yet.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the cash disbursements as the payments made during June. So, the company must have paid 85k in June (to cover the beginning accounts payable), and during the month, they made purchases that require paying cash or accounts payable. Because the ending accounts payable is 75k, that's the part that remains unpaid.

So, the total cash disbursements for June would be the beginning accounts payable (85k) plus the purchases made (330k) minus the ending accounts payable (75k), which equals 85k +330k =415k -75k=340k.

Hmm. So, the correct answer would be D, 340k. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 340000, which is 340k. So, the correct answer is D.

To determine the amount Star Co. should budget for cash disbursements for June purchases, we need to analyze the provided financial data:

1. **Sales**: $540,000  
2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: $300,000  
3. **Beginning inventory**: $150,000  
4. **Ending inventory**: $180,000  
5. **Accounts payable for purchases - June 1**: $85,000  
6. **Accounts payable for purchases - June 30**: $75,000  

### Step 1: Calculate Purchases  
The formula for COGS is:  
\[
\text{COGS} = \text{Beginning inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Ending inventory}
\]  
Rearranging to solve for Purchases:  
\[
\text{Purchases} = \text{COGS} + \text{Ending inventory} - \text{Beginning inventory}
\]  
Substituting the numbers:  
\[
\text{Purchases} = 300,000 + 180,000 - 150,000 = 330,000
\]  
Thus, purchases for June were $330,000.

### Step 2: Determine Cash Disbursements for June Purchases  
The cash disbursements for June purchases consist of two components:  
1. **Beginning accounts payable**: $85,000  
2. **Purchases made during June**: $330,000  

However, the ending accounts payable of $75,000 represents the amount owed for June purchases that will be paid in July. Therefore, the cash disbursements for June purchases are calculated as follows:  
\[
\text{Cash Disbursements} = \text{Beginning accounts payable} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Ending accounts payable}
\]  
Substituting the numbers:  
\[
\text{Cash Disbursements} = 85,000 + 330,000 - 75,000 = 340,000
\]  

### Final Answer  
The amount Star Co. should budget for cash disbursements for June purchases is **$340,000**, which corresponds to option **D**.
