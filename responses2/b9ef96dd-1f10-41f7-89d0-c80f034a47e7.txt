Okay, so I've got this question about Stark Co.'s financial statements. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that Stark Co. was named as a defendant in a lawsuit in October, and their legal counsel believes there's a chance for an unfavorable outcome. Damages could range from $10,000 to $15,000. The question is about whether they should accrue or disclose a contingent liability.

Hmm, what do I know about contingent liabilities? Oh right, a contingent liability is a potential obligation that might arise at some point in the future. It's not something that's certain but might happen if certain conditions are met. So, if Stark is a defendant, that means they're liable if the lawsuit is decided against them, right?

The key here is whether the liability exists at the end of the year. If the lawsuit hasn't been decided yet, then Stark isn't liable. But if it's decided in the future (and it's possible it's unfavorable), then they could be in a position where they're liable. But would they have a liability at December 31?

Wait, no. The company is a defendant—so they're liable if the lawsuit is decided against them. But the question is about whether they should accrue or disclose the liability at the end of the year. So if the lawsuit hasn't been decided, the liability doesn't exist. But if it could be decided, maybe in the future, they need to account for it.

But wait, the question states that the potential outcome is unfavorable, but it doesn't say anything about whether the outcome is known or not. So, if there's a possibility of an unfavorable outcome, does that mean the liability exists? Because if the outcome is unfavorable, the liability would arise regardless of whether it's favorable or not, right?

But wait, the question is about the December 31 financial statements. So, the liability hasn't been settled yet. So, what's the correct accounting treatment here?

I remember that contingent liabilities are disclosed in the financial statements only if they are probable and can be reasonably estimated, and if they could be settled within the next year. Otherwise, they might not be disclosed. But in this case, the issue is whether the liability exists or not.

Wait, but the problem is, Stark's liability hasn't been settled yet. So, the liability is contingent because it depends on the outcome of the lawsuit. But since the outcome is possible (unfavorable), the liability exists. However, if it's not certain whether it's settled in time, the liability might not be disclosed.

Wait, but there's a different angle here. If the lawsuit hasn't been decided yet, but there's a possibility of an unfavorable outcome, does that mean the liability is still there?

I think that if the outcome is uncertain, the liability might be considered contingent and hence should be disclosed. But I'm a bit confused because the fact that the outcome is unfavorable might mean that they're already in a position to sue, but that doesn't mean the liability is settled yet.

Wait, maybe the question is about whether the liability should be accrued. If the outcome is possible, but not certain, then the liability is a contingent liability. But if the outcome is certain (unfavorable), then the liability is settled, and no longer a contingent liability but a liability to report.

Wait, the question says that the outcome is possible but not certain. So the possibility exists. So, the liability is contingent and exists. But in the financial statements, can you disclose it?

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The question is whether they should accrue or disclose the contingent liability.

If the outcome is possible (i.e., favorable or unfavorable), but the outcome is not certain, then the liability is contingent. So, the liability exists but isn't yet settled. Therefore, in the financial statements, they should accrue it as a liability because it's a potential obligation. However, if the outcome is certain and unfavorable, then no liability exists, so no need to disclose.

Wait, but the question says the outcome is possible (unfavorable) but not certain. So, the possibility exists, but it's not certain. Therefore, the liability is a contingent liability.

So, in the December 31 financial statements, they should accrue the liability because it exists as a potential obligation. But would they disclose it? Because if the liability is contingent and could be settled within a year, it can be disclosed. But in this case, the lawsuit could be decided (unfavorably) in the future, which would settle the liability. But the current financial statements are for December 31, so if the outcome hasn't happened yet, the liability remains contingent and thus must be disclosed.

Wait, but I'm getting confused between whether the liability exists and whether it's settled. If the outcome is possible, then the liability exists because it's a potential obligation. But if the outcome is certain, then the liability is settled and no longer considered a liability.

But the question is about the December 31 financial statements. So, if the outcome is possible but not certain, the liability is a contingent liability that may arise, so it must be disclosed.

Wait, but I'm not sure whether the liability should be disclosed in the financial statements. The rules say that contingent liabilities are disclosed if they are probable and can be reasonably estimated, and if they could be settled within the next year. If the outcome is possible but not certain, they might have to disclose it, but only if it's probable and can be settled.

Wait, in this case, the possibility exists but it's not certain. So, if it's certain, they can report the liability. But since it's not certain, they have to disclose it as a contingent liability. But wait, the options don't include an option where they disclose a contingent liability, but the options are all about whether they accrue or disclose.

Looking back at the options, the question is whether they should accrue or disclose. The options are:

Accrue: Yes, if it's a potential obligation.

Disclose: Yes, if it's a contingent liability that could arise and is probable.

But the facts here: Stark's liability isn't settled yet, so it's a contingent liability. So, they should accrue it. But wait, if the outcome is possible, they should disclose it as a contingent liability. But wait, if the outcome is certain, then no liability exists—so no need to disclose.

Wait, but the outcome is possible, meaning it could happen. So, in this case, the liability exists as a potential obligation. Therefore, they should accrue it, but do they have to disclose it?

I think the answer depends on whether the outcome is certain or not. If the outcome is certain, they don't have to disclose it. But if it's possible but not certain, they have to disclose it as a contingent liability.

But the question doesn't state whether the outcome is certain. It just says it's possible for an unfavorable outcome. So, they have to consider whether they should disclose the liability.

In the case where the outcome is possible but the company is a defendant (so liable if the case is decided), but the outcome is not certain, the liability exists as a contingent liability. So, they must disclose it because it's a potential obligation that could arise.

Wait, but if the outcome is certain (say, favorable), then no liability exists, and no disclosure is needed. But in this case, the outcome is possible (unfavorable), but not certain. So, the liability is a contingent liability that could be settled in the future.

So, in the financial statements, they should disclose this contingent liability because it exists and could be settled.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option J is $10,000 to $15,000. So if they decide to disclose the liability, that's the range. But if the outcome is certain, they don't need to disclose. But the question says the outcome is possible (unfavorable), so the liability exists as a contingent liability.

So, they should disclose it, which would be a range from $10k to $15k (since the possible damages are in this range). So the correct action is to disclose a contingent liability.

But wait, the question asks whether they should accrue or disclose. So, if they are a party, they are a defendant, so their liability exists, so they should accrue it as a liability. But if it's a contingent liability, do they have to disclose it?

Wait, no. The question says "should Stark accrue and/or disclose in its December 31 financial statements?" So, the options are: can they accrue it (i.e., recognize the liability as it exists), and is it necessary to disclose it.

So, if the outcome is possible (unfavorable but not certain), then the liability exists as a contingent liability. So, they should accrue it (like recognize it as a liability). But do they need to disclose it? Because if the outcome is uncertain, it's a liability that might arise in the future, so they would need to disclose it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again: when a company is named as a defendant in a lawsuit that is possible to result in an unfavorable outcome, the liability arises because the company is liable for any damages if the lawsuit is decided against them. But the decision hasn't been made yet.

So, at December 31, the liability exists as a contingent liability because it's possible, but it may or may not be settled in the near future.

In financial statements, for contingent liabilities, the company must disclose them if they are probable and could be settled within a reasonable time frame. But if the outcome is possible but not certain, they can still disclose it as a contingent liability.

Wait, but can the company disclose the liability even if the outcome is possible but not certain? Because no matter how certain the outcome is, the company is a party to the lawsuit, so the liability exists. So, in this case, the liability is a contingent liability, so it must be disclosed.

Wait, but another angle: if the outcome is certain, they don't have to disclose. So, in this case, since the outcome is possible (unfavorable but not certain), the liability exists as a contingent liability, so they must disclose it.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where they both accrue and disclose. Let me look at the options again.

The options:

A: $150000 $0

B: $0 $150000

C: $0 $0

D: $0 $100000 - $150000

E: $100000 - $150000

F: $100000 - $0

G: $100000 - $100000

H: $150000 $150000

I: $150000 $100000 - $150000

J: $100000 - $150000

So, the question is whether they accrue and/or disclose.

Since the liability exists as a contingent liability, they need to accrue it. So, they should recognize it as a liability.

But do they have to disclose it? Because the outcome is possible but not certain, it's a contingent liability that may or may not be settled, so they need to disclose it.

Wait, but if the outcome is certain, no liability exists; if not certain, they have to disclose it.

In this case, the outcome is possible, so they do need to disclose it.

So, the answer would be that they should accrue the liability and disclose it. Looking at the options:

Which option says they accrue and disclose?

Looking at the options, option I says $150000 to $10k to $15k.

Wait, no, I is $150000 to $10k to $15k. So, that's being an accrual, and the disclosure range. But wait, I think I'm looking for the correct combination. The question is whether they should both accrue and disclose.

So, if they should accrue and disclose, but in the options, I don't see an option that combines both.

Looking:

The options are each a pair like A: $150000 and $0.

Wait, so the options are the amounts for accrue and disclose.

So, for example, option A says $150000 (accrue) and $0 ( Disclosure). That can't be right, because the liability exists; they should accrue it.

Wait, no, the options are not pairs of actions; each option is a combination of amounts, whether to accrue and/or disclose.

Wait, perhaps each option is a choice between whether to accrue and whether to disclose. So the question is, is the correct answer to accrue and disclose, or just one of them.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Looking again:

The options are each a pair of numbers, A to J.

The question is about whether Stark should accrue and/or disclose.

So, the correct answer would be that they should accrue the liability (so $150000 or $100000 to $150000) and they should disclose it.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where they accrue and disclose.

Looking at the choices:

Option J says $10k to $15k. And option D says $0 to $15k.

Wait, the options are:

A: Accrue $15k; Disclose $0.

B: Accrue $0; Disclose $15k.

C: Accrue $0; Disclose $0.

D: Accrue $0; Disclose $10k to $15k.

E: Accrue $10k to $15k.

F: Accrue $10k; Disclose $0.

G: Accrue $10k; Disclose $10k.

H: Accrue $15k; Disclose $15k.

I: Accrue $15k; Disclose $10k to $15k.

J: Accrue $10k to $15k; Disclose $10k to $15k.

Wait no, the options are for what they should accrue and/or disclose in their financial statements.

Wait, option J is $10k to $15k (accrue) and $10k to $15k (disclose). So, that would mean they're in the middle.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is to accrue the liability but not disclose it, but that would be if they don't have the possibility of being settled, but the question says it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what's a contingent liability. It's a liability that may or may not arise, depending on certain events. So, if the outcome is possible but not certain, it's a contingent liability that could be settled or not, so the company should disclose it as such.

So, they should accrue it because it's a potential obligation. But do they have to disclose it? Yes, because it's a contingent liability that could be settled within the next year? Or is that not the case?

Wait, I think that in the case of a contingent liability, it's disclosed if it's probable and can be reasonably estimated. But if the outcome is possible (i.e., favorable, unfavorable, or uncertain), then it's a contingent liability.

So, in this case, since the outcome is possible (unfavorable but not certain), they have to disclose it as a contingent liability. So, they must disclose that the liability exists and is a contingent liability.

But wait, if the outcome is certain and unfavorable, then there's no liability; if it's certain and favorable, assume it's settled.

So, in this question, the liability exists because it's a contingent liability, so they must accrue it and disclose it.

Looking back at the options, the option that says they should accrue $10k - $15k and disclose the same range would be option I: $150000 to $10k to $15k.

Wait, no, option I is $150000 and $10k to $15k. So, both $150000 (accrue) and $10k to $15k (disclose).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the liability is $15k at the end, they shouldn't be discarding the liability. Or perhaps I'm getting the options wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is to accrue the liability but not disclose it because the outcome is certain. But the question says the outcome is possible, so it's a contingent liability.

Wait, but the liability doesn't exist if the outcome is certain. Because if the lawsuit was decided in a particular way, they're no longer a party. So, if the outcome is certain, they wouldn't be a defendant anymore, so no liability exists. But in this case, the outcome is possible, so the liability exists.

So, the correct answer would be that they should accrue the liability and disclose it. But looking at the options, none of them directly say that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Options D and I.

Option D says $0 to $15k and $10k to $15k. So, they are not accreting but just not disclosing.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Maybe each option is a choice between whether to accrue and whether to disclose, but the options are structured differently.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

D: Accrue $0; Disclose $10k to $15k.

Wait, that would mean they don't accrue the liability, but they do disclose it. That doesn't make sense because they should accrue it as a liability.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are about whether they should both accrue and disclose, but I don't see an option that says both. So, perhaps I'm looking for the correct combination of actions.

I think the correct answer is that they should accrue and disclose. But since the options don't have an option that says both (e.g., "accrue and disclose"), perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: the liability arises because Stark is a defendant, but the outcome is possible, so they should accrue the liability and disclose it as a contingent liability.

So, the amount to accrue would be the range mentioned earlier, $10k to $15k, and they have to disclose it as a contingent liability.

Looking at the options, option I is $150000 (accrue) and $10k to $15k (disclose). So, that would be the correct answer. So, the answer is I.
</think>

The correct answer is **I**. 

**Explanation:**

Stark Co. was named as a defendant in a lawsuit that is possible to result in an unfavorable outcome. At December 31, the liability exists as a contingent liability because it may or may not arise depending on the outcome of the lawsuit. 

- **Accrue:** The liability exists as a potential obligation, so Stark Co. should accrue the liability.
- **Disclose:** Since the outcome is possible (unfavorable but not certain) and not certain, the liability is disclosed as a contingent liability.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**, which states that Stark Co. should accrue the liability and disclose it as a contingent liability.

ANSWER: I
