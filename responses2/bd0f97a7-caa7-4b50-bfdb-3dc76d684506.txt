Okay, so I need to figure out which character Woody replaced on the TV show 'Cheers'. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll start by recalling what I know about the show and its members.

I remember that 'Cheers' is a popular American TV series based on a mystery novel. It's been around for a while, so the staff has changed over the years. The question is asking about a specific replacement, specifically Woody.

From what I've heard, the show's cast has gone through several people. I think the main actors were Jim Carrey and Amy Pooh, but I'm not sure about the others. I've also heard that there were some new faces, maybe from other shows or roles in the show.

Wait, I think there was a character named Carla, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I might be mixing up names. Let me try to piece this together. 

In the early days, Jim Carrey played Jim Carrey, and Amy Pooh was the lead. Then there were other actors. I believe there was a character named Carla, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe someone else was replaced. 

Another thought: I think the show had a new cast member sometimes. Maybe a new character was added or someone was replaced with someone else. I'm trying to remember if there was a replacement by someone named Carla or maybe another name.

Wait, I think there's a character named Carla, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the replacement was someone else. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Another approach: I can think about the characters. The show started with Jim and Amy, and then had other actors. Maybe a character like Carla was replaced by someone else. Or perhaps a character like Vera.

Wait, I think the replacement was by someone named Carla, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's by Jim. Or perhaps it's by someone else.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the answer choices. The options are A: Norm, B: Cliff, C: Carla, D: Lilith, E: Vera, F: Sam, G: Frasier, H: Coach, I: Rebecca, J: Diane.

So the options are names of characters. Let me think about the people in 'Cheers'. Jim Carrey is definitely there. Amy Pooh is also a big part of it. Then there's someone named Carla, but I'm not sure if she was replaced. Wait, I think the show had a new character, maybe Carla was replaced by another name, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that in the show, there was a character named Carla, but I'm not certain if she was replaced. Or perhaps the replacement was by someone else.

Wait, I think the show had a new character named Carla, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think the correct answer is Carla. So the replacement was Carla, which is option C. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's the case.
