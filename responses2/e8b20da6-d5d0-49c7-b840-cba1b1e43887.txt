Question:

A bungee cord is 30.0 m long and, when stretched a distance x, it exerts a restoring force of magnitude kx. Your father-in-law (mass 95.0 kg) stands on a platform 45.0 m above the ground, and one end of the cord is tied securely to his ankle and the other end to the platform. You have promised him that when he steps off the platform he will fall a maximum distance of only 41.0 m before the cord stops him. You had several bungee cords to select from, and you tested them by stretching them out, tying one end to a tree, and pulling on the other end with a force of 380.0 N.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about bungee jumping. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the problem says a bungee cord is 30 meters long. When stretched by a distance x, it exerts a restoring force of kx. My father-in-law has a mass of 95 kg, and he's standing on a platform 45 meters above the ground. The cord is tied securely to his ankle and the platform. When he steps off, he falls a maximum of 41 meters before stopping. I need to find out how much the cord will stretch when I test it by pulling it with 380 N, and what that stretch distance is.

Wait, that sounds like a conservation of energy problem. I remember that when someone jumps off a platform and falls, their potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, and then into the elastic potential energy of the cord as it stretches.

So, the total distance fallen (41 m) is the length of the cord plus the stretch. Oh wait, no. The cord is 30 m long. So when he falls 41 m, the cord must stretch by 41 - 30 = 11 m? Or is it that the maximum stretch is 11 m? Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The cord is initially 30 m, and when he jumps, the cord is tied to his ankle, so the length of the cord is 30 m. When he falls, the cord starts to stretch. The maximum distance he falls is 41 m. So the total distance is 30 m (length of cord) plus the stretch, right? Because the cord is 30 m, and the length he falls is 41 m. So 41 = 30 + stretch. So the stretch is 11 meters. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when a bungee cord is used, the maximum stretch is when all the potential energy is converted into the cord's elastic potential energy. Hmm, maybe not. Let me clarify.

The total distance fallen is the length of the cord plus the stretch. So if the maximum fall is 41 m, and the cord is 30 m, the stretch is 11 m. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me check. The cord is 30 m long. When he jumps, the cord is attached at the other end. So when he falls 30 m, the cord is fully stretched, and then it starts to pull him back. So if the total fall is 41 m, then he falls 30 m of the cord, and then stretches an additional 11 m. So the cord stretches 11 m.

Wait, no. Wait, because the cord is 30 m. When you drop 30 m, the cord starts stretching. So if he falls a total of 41 m, the cord stretches 11 m. So the maximum stretch is 11 m.

But wait, the problem says the cord exerts a restoring force of kx, which is Hooke's law. So the cord will stretch until all the kinetic energy is converted into elastic potential energy.

So, when he steps off, his potential energy is converted into the elastic potential energy of the cord. So, the gravitational potential energy (m g h) is equal to the elastic potential energy (½ k x²). 

But wait, the maximum stretch would be the point where the cord is at its maximum extension. So in this case, the cord stretches 11 m. Because the total fall is 41 m (30 m cord length plus 11 m stretch).

So, m g (h) = ½ k (x)^2, where h is 11 m, x is 11 m, m is 95 kg.

Wait, but wait, is h the total distance fallen beyond the cord's length? Or is it the stretch beyond that? Let's see. If the cord is 30 m, and he falls 41 m, then the cord stretches 11 m beyond its initial length because 30 is the length when it's fully extended. So the maximum stretch is 11 m.

So, using m g h = ½ k x², where h is 11 m, x is 11 m.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Because when he starts falling, the cord starts to stretch. So the energy should come from the gravitational potential energy (m g h), which is converted into elastic potential energy (½ k x²) plus any kinetic energy at the point of maximum stretch. But since he comes to rest, the kinetic energy would be zero at the bottom.

Wait, wait. Actually, the initial potential energy is m g h, where h is the total distance fallen. Because he falls 41 m, so h is 41 m. But wait, the cord is 30 m. So the initial potential energy is m g (30 m + x), where x is the stretch. Because he falls the entire 30 m, and then stretches the cord by x. So the total potential energy is m g (30 +x), which is converted into the elastic potential energy (½ k x²). 

Wait, no. Wait, when he's at the lowest point, he hasn't started to stretch the cord. So the maximum stretch occurs when he's at the lowest point, and that's when the cord is fully extended. So the initial potential energy is m g (30 + x), and the elastic potential energy is ½ k x².

So, setting them equal: m g (30 + x) = ½ k x².

Wait, but I also have another condition. When you test the cord with a force of 380 N, the cord is stretched by a certain distance. Let's call that distance L. So, the force applied (F) is 380 N. According to Hooke's law, F = k L. So L = F /k = 380 /k.

Wait, but I don't know k yet. So perhaps I need to find k from the first part.

Wait, let's recap. From the first part, when the father-in-law falls 41 m, the cord stretches x =11 m. So, the equation is:

m g (30 + x) = ½ k x².

I can plug in the values. m=95 kg, g=9.8 m/s², x=11 m.

Compute 95 * 9.8 * (30 +11) = 95 *9.8 *41.

Compute that: 95*9.8 = approx 931 (95 *10 is 950, minus 95*0.2=19 → 931). 931 *41 is about 38,000 (900*40 is 36,000; 31*40=1,240; 900*1=900; 31*1=31 → total 36,000+1,240+900+31= 38,171). 

But wait, the right side is ½ k x². So:

95 *9.8 *41 = ½ k * (11)^2.

Compute 95 *9.8 = 931, as before.

So 931 *41 = (931 *40) + (931*1) = 37,240 + 931 = 38,171.

So, 38,171 = 0.5 *k * (121) → 

Because 11 squared is 121.

So, 38171 = 0.5 *k *121 → 

Multiply both sides by 2: 76342 = k *121 → 

So k = 76342 /121 → Let me compute that.

Divide 76342 by 121. Let's see, 121*630 is 76230 (121 *600=72600; 121*30=3630 → total 76230). So 76342 -76230=112. Then 112/121≈0.925. So approx 630.925.

Wait, let me compute 121 * 630 = 76230. 76342 -76230=112. 112/121 is about 0.925. So k≈630.925 N/m.

Wait, but that's the value of k. Now, the problem says that I have to test the cord with a force of 380 N, and find how much it stretches. So, using F = k L → L = F/k. So F is 380 N, k is 630.925 N/m.

So L = 380 / 630.925 → Let me compute that.

Approximately, 380 ÷ 630.925.

Hmm. 630 is about 630, 380 is 380. 380/630 is approximately 0.606 meters. So about 0.606 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.602 which is close to that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a rounding error.

Wait, let me compute 630.925 * 0.602.

0.6*630=378, 0.002 *630≈1.26. So 378 +1.26=379.26. Not sure. Alternatively, 0.602 *630.925.

But perhaps a better approach is to compute 380 / 630.925.

630.925 *0.6= 378.555.

380 -378.555=1.445.

So 1.445 /630.925 ≈ 0.002286.

So total L=0.6 +0.002286≈0.602286 meters, which is approximately 0.602 m, which matches option B.

So the correct answer is B: 0.602.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using energy conservation principles and Hooke's law. The bungee cord stretches 11 meters when the father-in-law falls 41 meters (30 m of cord length plus 11 m stretch). The equation for conservation of energy is:

\[
m g (30 + x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

Here, \(m = 95 \, \text{kg}\), \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\), and \(x = 11 \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:

\[
95 \cdot 9.8 \cdot (30 + 11) = \frac{1}{2} k \cdot 11^2
\]

\[
95 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 41 = \frac{1}{2} k \cdot 121
\]

\[
931 \cdot 41 = 60.5 \cdot k
\]

\[
38,171 = 60.5 \cdot k
\]

\[
k = \frac{38,171}{60.5} \approx 630.93 \, \text{N/m}
\]

Now, we test the cord with a force \(F = 380 \, \text{N}\). Using Hooke's law \(F = k L\), where \(L\) is the stretch:

\[
L = \frac{F}{k} = \frac{380}{630.93} \approx 0.602 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the bungee cord will stretch approximately 0.602 meters when tested with a force of 380 N.
