Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Minoan civilization. Hmm, I remember that Minoan is an ancient civilization, right? They were the ones who created the Linear A script, which is one of the earliest known writing systems. I think they also had some advanced society, like the first city, Minos, which was founded around 1550 BCE. 

So the question is asking about the two events that bracketed the peak of Minoan civilization, which is from 3650 to 3420 B.P. That would be the last few centuries of their civilization. I'm trying to recall what happened during their peak.

I think the peak was around 3000 BCE. So what events happened around that time? Well, one event I remember is the arrival of Linear A and Linear B scripts. Because if Linear A wasn't around, that might indicate the peak. Also, the decline of Minoan society, like the rise of the Hittites and the start of the Bronze Age. Because when Minoans were gone, that's when Bronze Age came, with tools and metals like iron.

Wait, the options are A through J. Let me check the options again. Option A says the introduction of Linear A and Linear B. That sounds right because that's a key event in Minoan history. Also, the replacement of Linear B with Linear A would happen around that time, I think. So the two events would be the introduction of these scripts and the adoption of Linear B.

Looking at the options, option A says the introduction of Linear A and Linear B. That would bracket the peak. Let me make sure there are no other options that fit. Option C is about the end of the Stone Age and the beginning of Bronze, which is more about the transition, but the peak was during middle periods, not the beginning. So C probably isn't the correct option. Similarly, other options like D involve bronze to iron, but I think the peak was more about Linear A and B. 

So the answer should be option A. Let me think again. The peak was during the Minoan times, so the introduction of these scripts would mark the end of the pre-literary society, right? And Linear B was the writing system they had. So the two events are their introduction of Linear A and Linear B, which would bracket the peak. Yeah, that makes sense. So option A is correct.

The correct answer is **A: the introduction of Linear A and the adoption of Linear B**. These events marked the end of the Minoan society and the beginning of Bronze Age advancements.
