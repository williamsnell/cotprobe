Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it carefully.

The son, a 21-year-old, enlisted in the army. He was about to leave for eight weeks of basic training. His father said, "I'll buy you a new car at the end of basic training if you promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol while at training." The son replied, "You can order the new car right away. I promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol, as you requested." After training, he got a leave and returned home. His father asked if he abide by his promise, and the son said yes. A week later, his father died suddenly, and the executor told him he didn't feel compelled to give him the car. The son is suing the executor to recover the car. He's asking if he'll succeed, and the options are A to E.

Okay, so the main question is about whether the son's promise to avoid drugs and drinking is sufficient to make the father's promise enforceable. 

Let me think about contracts. A contract requires mutual consideration. The son is promising not to drink or take drugs, but the father is promising to buy the car if he doesn't. So, does the father's promise have consideration? The father says he'll buy the car if he doesn't drink or drink. So, the father is offering the car as a conditional gift. The son's promise is to not drink and not drink, which is a condition for the father's promise.

Wait, but in some cases, when one party promises to do something that the other can offer a gift for, that might not be a contract. For example, if the father promises to buy the car if the son doesn't drink, that's a gift, not a promise. But the son is making a promise to not drink. So, the son is promising to refrain from two activities, but the father is promising to buy the car if he does so. So, does the father's promise have consideration?

Wait, in the traditional contract, consideration is mutual. If the son promises not to drink (which is a promise), and the father promises to buy the car if he doesn't, then the father's promise is conditional. But does that make a contract? Because the father's promise is a condition for the car. So, the father is offering the car only if the son doesn't drink. So, the father's promise is a conditional gift, but does that satisfy consideration? Because the father is making the promise to buy if the son doesn't drink, which is a promise. But the son's promise is not making a promise, it's just a statement of not doing something. So, in this case, the father's promise is conditional on the son's promise, but the son is making a promise about not doing something, which isn't a condition for anything. So, the father's promise doesn't have consideration from the son. Hence, the son didn't make a contract with the father.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting it wrong. The son's promise is not a condition for the father's promise. The father's promise is a condition for the son's promise, or vice versa? Wait no, the father's promise is about buying the car if the son doesn't drink. So, the son is promising not to drink, but the father is promising to buy the car if he doesn't. So, the son is making a promise about not drinking. The father is making a promise as to whether to give the car if the son doesn't.

So, the father's promise is a conditional promise. The son's promise isn't a condition, it's a promise to not do something. So, does the father's promise have consideration from the son? The father is making a promise as to delivery, which is a gift. The son's promise is about not doing something, which is a promise. But the father isn't giving anything in exchange for the son's promise. So, the father's promise doesn't have consideration from the son.

Therefore, the father's promise is not a contract because it lacks consideration. So, the son's promise isn't instrumental in making the father's promise enforceable. So, the father's promise is void because it lacks consideration. So, the son didn't make a contract with the father, and the executor can't enforce it.

Looking at the options, option B says the father's promise was void, so the executor can't enforce it. That seems to fit. So the correct answer is B, not succeed because the father's promise was void.

Wait, but is the father's promise a gift? Because gifts are considered consideration. So, if the father says he'll buy the car if the son doesn't drink, that's a gift. The son's promise is not a condition for that gift. So, the father's promise lacks consideration from the son because the son isn't making a promise in exchange for the father's gift. Instead, the father is promising to give the car under the condition that the son doesn't drink.

So, in a contract, mutual consideration is required. The father's promise is not getting anything in exchange for the son's promise. Therefore, the father's promise isn't a contract, so it's void. The son didn't make a legal promise to the father. Therefore, the father's promise is void, so the executor can't enforce it.

Hence, the father's promise was not in consideration. So, the father's promise was void, and the son can't sue him because it's not a valid contract.

Looking back at the options, option B says the father's promise was void. So the correct answer is B.
</think>

The son made a promise not to drink or drink while at basic training, promising to receive a new car if he did so. The father promised to buy the car if the son adhered to the terms. For the father's promise to be enforceable as a contract, it required mutual consideration. However, the son's promise was not in exchange for the father's promise; instead, the father's promise was a conditional gift. The son's promise was not a condition for the father's promise, and therefore, the father's promise lacked consideration from the son. As a result, the father's promise was void, and the son cannot recover the car under the terms of the contract.

ANSWER: B
