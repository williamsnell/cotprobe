Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a macroscopic object in a box, and I need to find the quantum number n. Hmm, let me think. I remember that quantum numbers come into play when you transition from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. 

The problem says the object has a mass of 1.0 gram. Wait, grams are grams, but I'll convert that to kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms. So, 1 gram is 0.001 kg. But wait, the speed is 1.0 cm/s. Oh right, centimeters to meters, so that's 0.01 meters per second. The length of the box is 1.0 cm, which is 0.01 meters.

The question is about the quantum number n in a one-dimensional box. I think this is related to the particle in a box model. In this model, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is something like E_n = (n² h²)/(8 m L²), where h is Planck's constant, m is mass, L is the length of the box, and n is the quantum number.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the quantum number when the object is moving in the box. Oh, but this object is macroscopic—like a ping-pong — so its wavelength is probably much larger than the dimensions of the box. That might be why we're using this model because the object's wavelength isn't small enough to be considered a particle in a box.

Alternatively, maybe this is a way to calculate the quantum number using the de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength is wavelength λ = h / (p), where p is the momentum. Since p = m*v, that's (0.001 kg) * (0.01 m/s) = 1e-5 kg·m/s. Then λ is h/(p), where h is Planck's constant. Planck's constant is 6.626e-34 J·s.

Calculating λ: (6.626e-34 J·s) / (1e-5 kg·m/s) = 6.626e-29 meters. Wait, that's a very small wavelength. The box is 1 cm (0.01 m), so the wavelength is 6.6e-29 m. That's way smaller than the box's size. So, the particle's wavelength is much less than the size of the box. So maybe the particle is behaving like a wave, which is why the model works.

Wait, but how does that relate to the quantum number n? Oh, right, in the particle in a box model, the energy levels are quantized, and the wavefunction has nodes. The particle's wavelength relates to the quantum number. The condition for the wavefunction to be zero at the ends of the box is that the wavelength is such that the box length is equal to half an integer multiple of the wavelength. So, L = n λ / 2. Wait, maybe it's L = (n + 1/2) λ/2? Or perhaps another relation. Let me think: The condition is that the wavefunction must be zero at x=0 and x=L. The standard solution for the particle in a box gives the wavelengths as multiples of 2L/(n+1/2), I think. Or maybe (n+1/2) something else.

Wait, no, the general approach is that the wavefunction must be zero at the ends. For the nth level, the wavefunction is a sine function that satisfies this condition. So, the wavelength λ for the nth level is (2L)/(n+1/2). Wait, no. Let me think again. The wave number k is given by k = n π / L, right? Because the wavefunction is sin(kx), and it must be zero at x=0 and x=L. So, for x=0, sin(0) is zero. At x=L, sin(k L) = 0, which implies k L = n π, where n is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). So, k = n π / L.

But the wave number k is related to the wavelength by k = 2π / λ. So substituting, (n π / L) = 2 π / λ → λ = 2 L / n.

Wait, that's correct. So the wavelength λ is 2 L / n. But wait, in that case, λ is 2L/n. So rearranging, n = 2 L / λ.

But earlier, from the particle's wavelength, I had λ = h/(p) = h/(m v). Let me compute that again.

m is 0.001 kg, v is 0.01 m/s.

p = m v = 0.001 kg * 0.01 m/s = 1e-5 kg m/s.

h is 6.626e-34 J s. So λ = h/p = 6.626e-34 / (1e-5) = 6.626e-29 meters. Oh wait, that's a tiny wavelength, as I thought earlier.

So, plugging into n = 2 L / λ.

L is 0.01 meters. So, λ is 6.626e-29 m.

n = (2 * 0.01 m) / (6.626e-29 m) = (0.02) / (6.626e-29) ≈ 3e26 (wait, 0.02 / 6.626e-29 = approx 3.017e26, but let me compute it more accurately.

0.02 divided by 6.626e-29: 2e-2 / 6.626e-29 = (2 / 6.626) * 1e27 ≈ (0.3017) * 1e27 ≈ 3.017e26.

So n is approximately 3e26. Looking at the options, option F is 2e26, G is 4e26, etc. So 3e26 isn't one of the options. Hmm. Wait, the options are A: 8e26, B:1e27, C:1e26, D:9e26, E:6e26, F:2e26, G:4e26, H:7e26, I:5e26, J:3e26.

Wait, J is 3e26. So our calculation gives n ≈3e26, which matches option J. But wait, wait a second. Let me think again: did I get the correct formula? Because earlier, I used n = 2L/λ. Another approach is using energy levels and relating to the quantum number.

Alternatively, the formula for the energy levels in the particle in a box model is E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²). But perhaps for large masses, the particle's momentum is such that we should use the de Broglie wavelength approach, because the object is so large that its wavelength is much smaller than the box, making the wavefunction approach not applicable in the same way.

Wait, but in this case, the object's wavelength is 6.6e-29 m, which is much smaller than the box length (1 cm = 0.01 m). So the particle's wavelength is much smaller than the box, implying that the quantum effects are more significant. So perhaps the particle isn't considered as a wave, but as a macroscopic object with translational motion.

In that case, maybe the quantum number comes from the velocity and the particle's de Broglie wavelength. Let me think again.

Another approach: The quantum number n is related to the particle's wavelength. For a particle in a one-dimensional box, the wavefunction is sin(n π x / L). The wavelength λ of the particle is 2 L / n, as per the condition that the wavefunction is zero at x=0 and x=L. So, λ = 2 L /n → n=2 L / λ.

But in this case, L is 0.01 m. The wavelength λ is 6.626e-29 m. So substituting: n = 2 * 0.01 m / (6.626e-29 m) = (0.02) / (6.626e-29) ≈ 3.017e26.

So n is approximately 3e26. Looking at the options, option J is 3e26. So the correct answer should be J. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the options don't have 3e26; wait, no, option J is 3e26.

Wait, wait, but earlier I thought the question was about a macroscopic object in a box, and macroscopic objects have large wavelengths, so perhaps the approach is different. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the particle in a box for some reason, or perhaps the formula I used is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is not about the quantum number in the particle in a box model, but rather the quantum number in the sense of the particle's wavefunction's nodes. But that's the same as the wave number approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the de Broglie wavelength approach, but in this case, the wavelength is much smaller than the box, so the particle's wavelength isn't the same as the box's size. So the quantum number might be something else.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the de Broglie wavelength and then compute n based on that. So, the wavelength λ = h/(m v). Let's compute that again.

m = 0.001 kg, v = 0.01 m/s.

p = m*v = 0.001 kg * 0.01 m/s = 1e-5 kg·m/s.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So, λ = h/(p) = 6.626e-34 / (1e-5) = 6.626e-29 meters. So about 6.626e-29 m.

The box length L is 0.01 m = 1e-2 m.

So, n = (2 L) / λ = (2 * 1e-2 m) / (6.626e-29 m) = (2e-2) / (6.626e-29) → approx 3.017e26.

Which is 3e26, so option J. But looking back, the options don't have 3e26 except option J. So the answer would be J:3e26.

Wait, but wait a moment. The problem states that it's a macroscopic object moving in a box. So, maybe the approach is incorrect and the correct answer is not related to the n in the particle in a box model. Because for macroscopic objects, the de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the box, so the quantum number might not be applicable in the same way. Alternatively, perhaps the quantum number is calculated differently.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the quantum number in the sense of the particle's quantum state in the box, which for a macroscopic object would make the particle's wavelength much smaller than the box, leading to a large quantum number. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the calculation using the de Broglie wavelength gives n ≈3e26, which is option J. So that would be the answer. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 

Compute λ:

p = m*v = 0.001 kg * 0.01 m/s = 1e-5 kg·m/s.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

λ = h / p = 6.626e-34 / 1e-5 = 6.626e-29 meters.

n = (2 L) / λ = (2 * 0.01 m) / (6.626e-29 m) = 0.02 / 6.626e-29.

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /6.626e-29 = 2/(6.626e27) → wait, no, wait: 2e-2 /6.626e-29 = (2 /6.626) * 1e27 → 2/6.626 is approx 0.3017, so 0.3017e27 → about 3.017e26. So n=3e26, which is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the particle in a box formula, which would give a different calculation.

Wait, let me try using the energy formula. E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²). And perhaps the energy is related to the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

But since the object is moving at 1 cm/s, which is 0.01 m/s, that's very low speed, so the kinetic energy is (0.5 * 0.001 kg * (0.01)^2) → (0.5 * 0.001 * 0.0001) = 0.5 * 1e-6 → 5e-7 J.

But using the energy formula: E_n = (n² h²)/(8 m L²). Let's compute that and see if it matches.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

m=0.001 kg, L=0.01 m.

E_n = (n² (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (8 * 0.001 kg * (0.01)^2 )

Compute denominator: 8 * 0.001 kg * (0.01 m)^2 = 8 * 0.001 * 0.0001 = 8e-5 (kg m²).

Denominator: 8e-5 kg m².

Numerator: n² * (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ n² * 4.39e-65 (since (6.626e-34)^2 is about 4.39e-65).

So E_n ≈ (4.39e-65 n²) / (8e-5) → (4.39 / 8) e-60 n² → approx 0.55e-60 n² → 5.5e-61 n² J.

But the kinetic energy is 5e-7 J. So setting E_n = 5e-7 J.

5.5e-61 n² = 5e-7 → n² = (5e-7) / (5.5e-61) → (5/5.5) * 1e54 → approx 0.909 *1e54 → about 9e53.

n² ≈ 9e53 → n ≈ 3e26.5 → Wait, 3e26.5 is sqrt(1e53) = 1e26.5 → 3.16e26.

So n≈3.16e26. Which is approximately 3e26, which matches our earlier calculation. So this method gives the same result.

But wait, that's using the energy formula. But the question is about the quantum number n, not the energy. So both methods give n≈3e26.

So the correct answer is J:3e26.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the quantum number \( n \) for a macroscopic object of mass \( m = 1.0 \, \text{g} \) moving with speed \( v = 1.0 \, \text{cm/s} \) in a one-dimensional box of length \( L = 1.0 \, \text{cm} \). The approach involves using the de Broglie wavelength and the particle in a box model.

### Step 1: Convert units
- Mass: \( m = 1.0 \, \text{g} = 0.001 \, \text{kg} \)
- Speed: \( v = 1.0 \, \text{cm/s} = 0.01 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Box length: \( L = 1.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength
The de Broglie wavelength is given by:
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}, \quad \text{where } p = m v
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
p = m v = 0.001 \, \text{kg} \times 0.01 \, \text{m/s} = 1.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{1.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{kg·m/s}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 3: Relate the de Broglie wavelength to the quantum number \( n \)
In the particle in a box model, the wave number \( k \) is related to the wavelength by:
\[
k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}
\]
For the \( n \)-th energy level, the wave number satisfies:
\[
k = \frac{n \pi}{L} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{2L}{n}
\]
Rearranging for \( n \):
\[
n = \frac{2L}{\lambda}
\]
Substituting \( L = 0.01 \, \text{m} \) and \( \lambda = 6.626 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{m} \):
\[
n = \frac{2 \times 0.01}{6.626 \times 10^{-29}} = \frac{0.02}{6.626 \times 10^{-29}} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{26}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated value of \( n \) is approximately \( 3.017 \times 10^{26} \), which matches option **J**.

### Final Answer:
ANSWER: J
