Okay, so I've got this question here about what percentage of Turks say God plays an important role in their life as of 2019. The options are A to J, with various percentages. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the current stats, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in recent surveys, people often include religious beliefs. But I'm not certain about the exact figure. I think in the past, there were studies showing a significant role of the divine in life. For example, I've heard about a 2013 study where 50-50 split was noted, but I'm not sure if that's accurate anymore. Wait, 2019 is the current year, so maybe the numbers have changed.

Let me think about the possible trends. In the past, I believe that around 50% of the population said something like "God is all around us," but I'm not sure. Now, I've heard that more people might now consider God a central part of their lives, especially with the rise of secularism and the internet. So maybe the percentage has increased a bit.

Looking at the options, the highest percentage is 99%, which is option J. Wait, that's a high number. But was that for the last decade or the current year? I think the current percentages might be lower because people might prefer to express their views without being too extreme. So maybe 50% is a more recent figure.

Another angle: I remember that in 2013, a survey by the American Council of Congress found that 50% of Americans believed God is everywhere. But that's older. Since 2019, I think the numbers might have changed. Maybe around 60-70%? That would point towards option G (89%) or F (69%).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. I think in 2019, a survey might have found that 69% of Turks believe God plays an important role. That would make option E correct. Alternatively, another source I recall said that the majority of Turks (over 50%) believe in God's role in life.

Alternatively, I've heard conflicting reports. Some say it's around 50-60%, so option E (69%) is a possible answer. Others might have higher percentages. But considering recent social media and surveys, perhaps there's a shift towards more positive views.

Wait, I think the correct answer is 69%, so option E.

The correct answer is E: 69%. 

Answer: E
