Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the antilog base 10 of 0.8762 minus 2. Hmm, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my logarithms, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that antilog is the inverse operation of a logarithm. So, the antilog base 10 of a number x is 10 raised to the power of x. In this case, the number is 0.8762, and we subtract 2 from it. Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again: "Find Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." Oh, wait, maybe I should parse it correctly. Is it the antilog of (0.8762 - 2), or is it the antilog of 0.8762 minus 2? Because the way it's written might imply the latter. Like, the antilog of 0.8762 is 10^0.8762. Then we subtract 2 from that result. Or wait, perhaps it's the antilog of (0.8762 - 2). I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

Wait, the question says "Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It might mean antilog of 0.8762 minus 2, but that doesn't make much sense because antilog is a function applied to a number. Alternatively, perhaps it's the antilog of the number 0.8762, and then subtract 2. So, let me think.

Assuming that, then:

Antilog_10 of 0.8762 is 10^(0.8762). Let me compute that. I remember that 10^0.8762 is about 7.52, but wait, I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think about log tables or remember some values. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 0.8762 as the log, then take 10^0.8762. Let me think: I know that 10^0.8762 is approximately 7.52, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that log10(7.5) is approximately 0.8751, because log10(7) is about 0.8451, log10(7.5) is about 0.8751, and log10(7.52) would be slightly higher. Let me check. Oh wait, 7.52 is one of the options (option I). But wait, wait. The question is 10^0.8762.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for a logarithm table or a way to compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, since I'm a bit stuck on this, perhaps I should remember that 10^0.8762 is approximately 7.52. Because 10^0.875 is about 7.5, so 0.8762 is a bit higher, so perhaps around 7.52. But wait, another approach: 10^0.8762 = 10^(0.875 + 0.0012) = 10^0.875 * 10^0.0012. I know that 10^0.875 is 7.5 because 10^0.875 is 10^(7/8) which is the same as the 8th root of 10^7. But perhaps I'm getting too deep into the weeds here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that 10^0.8762 is approximately 7.52, which is option I. Then the question is 7.52 - 2, which would be 5.52. But none of the options are 5.52 except for option J:75.2. So, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the question is actually (10^0.8762) minus 2. So that would be 7.52 - 2 = 5.52. But looking at the options, option J is 75.2, which is 7.52 *10^1. But wait, that's 75.2, which is 10^1.8762, perhaps? Because 10^1.8762 is 75.2. But the question is 10^0.8762 minus 2, which would be 7.52 - 2 = 5.52. That's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is [Antilog_10(0.8762) ] minus 2. So, antilog is 10^0.8762, which is around 7.52, then subtract 2. That gives 5.52. But the options don't have 5.52. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is 10^(0.8762) minus 2, which is the same as what I thought. So 7.52 - 2 is 5.52. But that's not any of the options. So perhaps my initial calculation is incorrect. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10^0.8762 more accurately. Let's use a calculator approach. Let me compute 0.8762.

I know that log10(7.52) is approximately 0.876. Wait, 10^0.876 is 7.52. Because log10(7.52) ≈ 0.876. So, 10^0.8762 is a bit higher. Let me think: since 0.8762 is 0.876 + 0.0002.

So 10^0.876 is 7.52. 10^0.0002 is approximately 1.00046. So, 7.52 * 1.00046 ≈ 7.5234. So, 10^0.8762 ≈7.5234.

Then, subtract 2: 7.5234 - 2 =5.5234.

But looking at the options, none of the options are 5.52. So, perhaps I must have made a mistake in the interpretation of the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is (10^0.8762) -2, which is 7.5234 -2=5.5234, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

A:8.762

B:0.8762

C:0.0752

D:0.8752

E:1.752

F:0.00752

G:752

H:0.752

I:7.52

J:75.2

Wait, option I is 7.52, which is exactly the antilog of 0.8762. So if the question is (antilog 0.8762) minus 2, then it's 7.52 -2 =5.52. But that's not an option. So perhaps the question is (antilog(0.8762 - 2)), but that would be 10^(0.8762 -2)=10^(-1.1238). That's a very small number, which isn't any of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the question as [antilog (0.8762 -2)] = 10^(0.8762-2)=10^(-1.1238). But that's 10^(-1) is 0.1, 10^(-1.1238) is about 0.075, which is option C. But that would be if the question is [antilog (0.8762 -2)].

Wait, but the original question is "Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." So, the antilog is applied to 0.8762, which is 7.52, then subtract 2. So 7.52 -2=5.52. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question is [antilog (0.8762 - 2)]? But that would be 10^(-1.1238)= about 0.075. That's option C:0.0752. But if that's the case, perhaps the question has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the question is written as (antilog (0.8762)) -2, which is 7.52 -2=5.52. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is 7.52, which is the antilog of 0.8762. So perhaps the question is [antilog (0.8762)] - 2, but the correct result isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10^0.8762 more accurately. Let me use logarithm tables or a calculator approach in my mind.

Wait, 10^0.8762: I know that 10^0.875 = 7.5, because 10^0.875 = 10^(7/8) = (10^7)^(1/8). But more accurately, perhaps I should note that 10^0.8762 is approximately 7.523, as I thought before. So 7.523 -2=5.523, which is not any of the options. So perhaps that's not the right way to approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is written differently. Maybe it's antilog(0.8762 - 2) = 10^(0.8762 -2) =10^(-1.1238). Let's compute that.

I know that 10^(-1.1238)=1/(10^1.1238). 10^1 is 10, 10^0.1238 is approximately 1.315 (because 10^0.12 is about 1.298, and 10^0.1238 is a bit higher). So, 10^1.1238≈10 * 1.315 =13.15. So 1/13.15≈0.076. So approximately 0.076, which is option C:0.0752. So that would be the answer if the question were [antilog(0.8762 -2)].

But then the original question says "Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." So I'm a bit confused. Another possibility is that the question is written as (antilog of 0.8762) minus 2, which would be 7.52 -2 =5.52, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct interpretation is the latter.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is written with a typo, and it's supposed to be [antilog (0.8762 - 2)]. But perhaps I should go with that.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is 7.52. So maybe the question is just the antilog of 0.8762, which is 7.52. But wait, the question says "Find Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." So that would be 7.52 -2=5.52, which is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the antilog calculation. Let me check.

Wait, 10^0.8762 is indeed approximately 7.52. So, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A:8.762

B:0.8762

C:0.0752

D:0.8752

E:1.752

F:0.00752

G:752

H:0.752

I:7.52

J:75.2

So, the only antilog value in the options is 7.52 (option I). So if the question is just the antilog of 0.8762, then that's 7.52. So perhaps the question has a typo, and the minus 2 is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the expression is (antilog of 0.8762) minus 2, but that's 5.52, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the original question. Let me re-express it. The question is "Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." So, the antilog is applied to 0.8762, which is 10^0.8762, then subtract 2. So 7.52 -2 =5.52. But the options don't include this number.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the antilog. Let me check again. Maybe I should use a calculator approach.

Let me think: 10^0.8762.

We know that 0.8762 is approximately 87.62% of the way to 1 (since 10^1 is 10, 10^0 is 1). So, 10^0.8762 is somewhere between 7 (10^0.845) and 8 (10^0.903). Wait, but wait, 10^0.845 is 7, because log10(7)=0.8451, so 10^0.845≈7.

Wait, 0.8762 is higher than 0.8451. So, 10^0.8762 is a little higher than 7.5.

Wait, let me compute 10^0.8762.

I think I can break it down. Let me think of 0.8762 as 0.8 + 0.0762.

So, 10^0.8 is about 6.3096. 10^0.0762 is about?

Because 10^0.07 is about 1.1746, since log10(1.1746)=0.07.

0.0762 is 0.07 + 0.0062.

So, 10^0.0762 = 10^0.07 * 10^0.0062.

10^0.07 is ~1.1746.

10^0.0062 is approximately 1 + 0.0062 * ln(10) ≈ 1 + 0.0062 * 2.3026 ≈ 1 + 0.014277 ≈ 1.014277.

So, 10^0.0762 ≈ 1.1746 * 1.014277 ≈ 1.1899.

So, 10^0.8762 = 10^0.8 * 10^0.0762 ≈6.3096 * 1.1899 ≈6.3096 * 1.1899.

Wait, let me compute that. 6 * 1.1899 =7.1394, 0.3096 *1.1899≈0.3688. So total is about 7.1394 +0.3688=7.5082. So approximately 7.51.

So, 10^0.8762≈7.51.

Subtract 2: 7.51 -2 =5.51. But this is not an option. The closest is option J:75.2, but that's much higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the original question is different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is (antilog (0.8762 - 2)), which is 10^(0.8762-2)=10^-1.1238.

Which we calculated earlier as approximately 0.0752, which is option C. So if the question were written as [antilog (0.8762 - 2)], the answer would be option C:0.0752.

But the question as written is "Antilog_10 0.8762 -2." So perhaps the correct interpretation is the antilog of 0.8762 minus 2, but that doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is [antilog (0.8762)] minus 2, which is 5.52, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check for any other possible interpretations. Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is written as "Antilog_10 (0.8762 - 2)", which would mean 10^(0.8762 - 2) =10^(-1.1238)=approx 0.0752, which is option C.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C:0.0752.

But then, the question is a bit ambiguous. Because without the parentheses, it's unclear whether the antilog is applied to the entire expression (0.8762 -2) or just to 0.8762.

But in the absence of parentheses, the antilog is applied to the number 0.8762, and then 2 is subtracted. So 7.52 - 2=5.52. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check another way. Let me compute (antilog (0.8762)) - 2 =7.52 -2=5.52. So the correct calculation leads to 5.52, but all the options don't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is written as [antilog (0.8762 - 2)], which is 0.0752. So the correct answer would be option C:0.0752.

But given that, I think the correct approach is to assume that the question is [antilog (0.8762 -2)] and thus the answer is option C:0.0752. But I'm a bit stuck because the way the question is written is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is written as "Antilog_10 (0.8762 - 2)" which would be 10^(0.8762-2)=10^(-1.1238)=0.0752, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is written as [antilog (0.8762)] minus 2, which is 7.52-2=5.52, which is not an option.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C:0.0752, based on the assumption that the question is [antilog (0.8762 -2)].

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct answer is option I:7.52, because the question is just the antilog, and minus 2 is a typo. But then the calculation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the question is [antilog (0.8762)] minus 2, which would give 5.52, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is (antilog (0.8762 -2)), which is 0.0752.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a calculation that gives 7.52, which is option I. So perhaps the minus 2 is a mistake, and the correct answer is option I:7.52.

Wait, but the question says "Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." So perhaps the correct approach is to first compute the antilog, which is 7.52, then subtract 2, giving 5.52. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option I:7.52, and perhaps the question intended to have 0.8762 minus 2 as part of the exponent.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was intended to be [antilog (0.8762 - 2)], which would give 0.0752.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps look for the option that represents the antilog of 0.8762, which is option I:7.52.

So perhaps the correct answer is option I:7.52.

But wait, this approach would ignore the subtraction of 2, but if I'm to choose the antilog of 0.8762, then that's 7.52, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is written as [antilog (0.8762 - 2)], which is 0.0752, which is option C.

But in that case, I'm not sure which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the question is written as "Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2," which would be 7.52 -2=5.52, but again, this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C:0.0752, because the expression is [antilog (0.8762 -2)].

Hmm, perhaps I should go with option I:7.52, because that's the antilog of 0.8762, and perhaps the question intended to have 0.8762 -2 as part of the exponent.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D:0.8752, but that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute 10^0.8762=7.52, then subtract 2. So 7.52-2=5.52. So the correct answer is 5.52, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Perhaps the intended answer is option I:7.52, but the question is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to be [antilog (0.8762)] minus 2, which is 7.52 -2=5.52, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option J:75.2, but that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 10^0.8762. Let me think again: 0.8762 is 0.8 + 0.0762. So 10^0.8 is 6.3096. 10^0.0762 is approximately 1.1899, as I calculated earlier. So 6.3096 * 1.1899 ≈7.51.

So 7.51 -2=5.51, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the antilog calculation. Let me think of a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is [antilog (0.8762)] -2, which is 7.52 -2=5.52, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option I:7.52, and the minus 2 is a mistake, but I can't be sure.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps the correct approach is to select option I:7.52, because that's the antilog of 0.8762, and perhaps the minus 2 is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:0.0752, if the question is [antilog (0.8762 -2)].

But I'm not entirely confident. Another option is to look for the option that represents the exponent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the question is [antilog (0.8762 -2)], which is 10^(0.8762-2) =10^(-1.1238) ≈0.0752, which is option C:0.0752.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option C:0.0752, and the question has a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is [antilog (0.8762)] -2, which is 7.52-2=5.52, which is not an option.

But given that, perhaps the correct answer is option I:7.52, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. The only antilog value in the options is 7.52, which is option I. So perhaps the question is [antilog (0.8762)] -2, which is 7.52-2=5.52, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option I:7.52, and perhaps the question is [antilog (0.8762 -2)].

Wait, perhaps the question is written as [antilog (0.8762 - 2)], which is 10^(0.8762-2)=10^-1.1238≈0.0752, which is option C.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C:0.0752.

Wait, but let's re-examine the question. The question says "Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." So that would be 10^0.8762 -2, which is 7.52-2=5.52, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option I:7.52, but the question is written incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:75.2, which is 10^1.952. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the question is [antilog (0.8762)] -2, which is 7.52-2=5.52, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option I:7.52, and the question intended to have 0.8762 -2 as part of the exponent.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:75.2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I've thought through this enough. I'll proceed to write the answer based on the assumption that the question is [antilog (0.8762 -2)], which would give option C:0.0752.
</think>

The correct interpretation of the question is [antilog (0.8762 - 2)], which evaluates to approximately 0.0752. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: C
