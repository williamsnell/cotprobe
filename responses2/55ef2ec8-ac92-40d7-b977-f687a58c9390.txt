Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron in a one-dimensional box. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, so I need to think carefully.

The question says that an electron transitions from a certain excited energy level to the ground state, emitting a photon with a wavelength of 8.79 nm. The box has a length of 2.00 Å. I need to find the quantum number of the initial state.

Hmm, I remember that in a one-dimensional box, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels in a 1D box is something like E_n = (n² h²)/(8 m L²), where n is the quantum number, h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the length of the box.

Wait, but since the electron is making a transition from a higher energy level to the ground state (n=1), the photon's energy should be equal to the difference between these two energy levels. Right, because when an electron drops to a lower energy level, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference.

So, the energy of the photon is given by E_photon = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the emitted photon.

Let me jot down the known values:

λ = 8.79 nm = 8.79e-9 meters.
Box length L = 2.00 Å = 2.00e-10 meters.

I need to find the initial quantum number n_initial. The final state is n_final = 1, since that's the ground state.

So, the energy difference ΔE between the initial and final states is E_initial - E_final = E_photon.

So:

ΔE = E_initial - E_final = (n_initial² - 1) * (h²)/(8 m L²) = E_photon.

Now, E_photon can also be written as hc/λ, so:

(n_initial² - 1) * (h²)/(8 m L²) = hc/λ.

I can rearrange this to solve for n_initial². Let me see:

n_initial² - 1 = (8 m L² c) / (h² λ) * (something?)

Wait, let's do the algebra step by step.

Starting from:

(n_initial^2 - 1) * (h²/(8 m L²)) = (h c)/λ.

Divide both sides by (h²/(8 m L²)):

n_initial² -1 = (h c / λ) * (8 m L²)/(h²)

Simplify the right side. The h in the numerator and denominator cancels:

= (8 m L² c) / (h λ )

So,

n_initial² -1 = (8 m L² c)/(h λ)

Wait, but I can compute this expression numerically.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Compute numerator and denominator separately.

m = mass of electron = 9.109e-31 kg.

c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s.

L = 2.00e-10 m.

λ = 8.79e-9 m.

So, numerator: 8 * m * L² * c.

Denominator: h * λ.

Compute numerator:

8 * 9.109e-31 kg * (2.00e-10 m)^2 * 3e8 m/s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

(2.00e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Multiply all together:

8 * 9.109e-31 * 4e-20 * 3e8.

Let me compute 8 * 9.109e-31 = 7.2872e-30.

Then 7.2872e-30 *4e-20 = 2.91488e-49.

Multiply by 3e8: 2.91488e-49 * 3e8 = 8.74464e-41.

So the numerator is 8.74464e-41 kg·m²/s.

Denominator: h * λ = 6.626e-34 * 8.79e-9.

Compute that: 6.626e-34 * 8.79e-9.

6.626 *8.79 is approximately 58.3.

So 58.3e-43 = 5.83e-42.

So now, n_initial² -1 = (8.74464e-41) / (5.83e-42) )

Divide 8.74464e-41 by 5.83e-42.

Which is (8.74464 /5.83 ) * (e-41 / e-42) ) = (approx 15.06) * (10) = 150.61.

Wait, wait, 8.74464e-41 / 5.83e-42 = (8.74464 /5.83) * (1e-41 / 1e-42) ) → 1.506 * 10 = 15.06.

So n_initial² -1 = 15.06 → n_initial² = 16.06 → n_initial is sqrt(16.06) ≈ 4.0075.

Hmm, that's approximately 4.0075. So n_initial is about 4, but let me double-check my calculation because perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entire numerator and denominator more accurately.

Wait, the numerator: 8 * m * L² * c.

m = 9.10938356e-31 kg (exact value but I'll use more precise for calculation.)

L = 2.00e-10 m.

So, L² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Multiply all:

8 * 9.10938356e-31 kg *4e-20 m² * 3e8 m/s.

Compute each step:

8 *9.10938356e-31 =7.287506848e-30.

Multiply by 4e-20 → 7.287506848e-30 *4e-20 =2.915002739e-49.

Multiply by 3e8 → 2.915002739e-49 *3e8 = 8.745008217e-41.

Denominator: h * λ =6.62607015e-34 J·s *8.79e-9 m.

6.62607015e-34 * 8.79e-9 = (6.62607015 *8.79) * 1e-43.

Compute 6.62607015 *8.79:

6 *8=48, 6*0.79≈4.74 → 6.626 *8.79 → let me compute:

6.626 *8.79 = (6 *8.79) + (0.626 *8.79)

6 *8.79 =52.74

0.626 *8.79 = approx 5.48 (since 8.79 *0.6=5.274, 0.026*8.79=0.2285 → total 5.5025).

So 52.74 +5.5025=58.2425.

So approximately 58.2425.

So denominator is 58.2425e-43 =5.82425e-42.

So now, n_initial² -1 = (8.745008217e-41) / (5.82425e-42) ) → 8.745e-41 /5.824e-42 ≈ (8.745 /5.824) * (1e-41 /1e-42) → approximately 1.506 *10 =15.06.

So n_initial² =16.06 → n_initial ≈4.0075.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order of magnitude. Let me think. 8.745e-41 is approximately 8.745e-41, and 5.824e-42 is 5.824e-42. So dividing them gives (8.745 /5.824) * (1e-41 /1e-42) )= (approx 1.506) *10 =15.06.

So n_initial squared is 16.06, so n_initial is about 4.007. Since quantum numbers are integers, n_initial must be 4. Because 4 squared is 16, so 16.06 is close to 16, so the correct quantum number is 4.

Looking at the options, option D is 4. So the answer should be D.

To determine the quantum number of the initial state of the electron in a one-dimensional box, we use the relationship between the energy difference of the electron and the emitted photon. The energy of the photon is given by:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 8.79 \, \text{nm} = 8.79 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{8.79 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

For a one-dimensional box, the energy levels are quantized as:

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8 m L^2},
\]

where \(m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\) is the mass of the electron, \(L = 2.00 \, \text{Å} = 2.00 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), and \(n\) is the quantum number. The energy difference between the initial state (\(n_{\text{initial}}\)) and the ground state (\(n_{\text{final}} = 1\)) is:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}} = E_{\text{photon}}.
\]

Substituting the energy expressions:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{initial}}^2 h^2}{8 m L^2} - \frac{h^2}{8 m L^2} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{(n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1) h^2}{8 m L^2} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]

Canceling \(h^2\) and rearranging:

\[
n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1 = \frac{8 m L^2 c}{h \lambda}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1 = \frac{(8)(9.109 \times 10^{-31})(2.00 \times 10^{-10})^2 (3 \times 10^8)}{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(8.79 \times 10^{-9})}.
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
8 \cdot 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \cdot (2.00 \times 10^{-10})^2 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 8.745 \times 10^{-41}.
\]

Next, compute the denominator:

\[
6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 8.79 \times 10^{-9} = 5.824 \times 10^{-42}.
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
\frac{8.745 \times 10^{-41}}{5.824 \times 10^{-42}} \approx 15.06.
\]

Thus:

\[
n_{\text{initial}}^2 - 1 = 15.06 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{\text{initial}}^2 = 16.06 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{\text{initial}} \approx 4.007.
\]

Since \(n_{\text{initial}}\) must be an integer, the closest value is \(n_{\text{initial}} = 4\).
