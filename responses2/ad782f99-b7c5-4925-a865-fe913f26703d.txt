Question:

Young Tina had never seen the space shuttle until her parents pointed out a picture of it ready to launch. When she next saw a picture of it flying, she had difficulty recognizing it. Which concept best explains this problem?

Options:

A: dishabituation
B: sensory adaptation
C: perceptual adaptation
D: summation
E: perceptual set
F: sensory interaction
G: binocular cue
H: depth perception
I: shape constancy
J: autokinetic effect

Okay, so I have a question here about a child and space shuttles. Let me try to figure it out. The question says that Young Tina couldn't recognize a space shuttle picture until her parents showed it. Then, when she saw another picture flying, she couldn't recognize it either. Which concept explains this?

Hmm, I remember learning about concepts related to perception. The options are A through J. Let me think about each one.

A: Dishabituation. I think dishabituation is when the nervous system becomes automatic, so it doesn't adapt to new information. So if the shuttles are new, the child would be stuck and not recognize them. That fits with the scenario because she couldn't recognize them the first time.

B: Sensory adaptation. That's when the senses become more detailed or specific. Not sure how that would cause a problem. Maybe the child's eyes don't adapt, so she can't see the shuttle. But the question is about not recognizing it, not about sensory details.

C: Perceptual adaptation. That's when the senses become more nuanced. Again, maybe not directly causing the issue; the child can still see the shuttle, just not recognize it.

D: Summation. That's about how different parts of the nervous system work together. Not sure how that would relate to not recognizing the shuttle because it's about the overall function, not the individual elements.

E: Perceptual set. This is when the person is stuck with a way of perceiving something, even though new information arrives. So if the child couldn't recognize the shuttle even when it was flying, maybe she's stuck with a usual way of seeing, like the pictures she saw before. That makes sense because when the shuttle comes, it's a new image, but she didn't adapt.

Wait, let me think again. Dishabituation is when the system becomes automatic. So when the shuttle comes, it's a new situation, but the system has become too fast to adapt. So the child can't recognize the shuttle because it's too new, and the system is stuck in the old way.

Perceptual set is when you can't change your perception because it's fixed. So when the shuttle comes, you can't see it because your existing way of perceiving it doesn't apply. That would mean she couldn't recognize it.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused between dishabituation and perceptual set. Let me recall. Dishabituation is a type of illusory recognition where the child can't recognize the new image because the system is too fast to adapt. So, the shuttles come and go so fast that the child can't process them.

Perceptual set is when your brain is stuck in your old way of perceiving, so when a new image comes, you can't recognize it because you can't adjust. Both seem similar in that the child couldn't recognize the new images because the system didn't adapt.

Wait, but dishabituation is a type of illusory recognition where the child doesn't recognize the new image because the system is too fast to adapt. So maybe the correct answer is dishabituation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the concept of not being able to recognize new information because the system is too adapted, leading to a perceptual set.

Wait, but dishabituation is about the system becoming so fast that the new image is perceived as a new thing, but the system is stuck. So the child can't recognize it because she was used to seeing it before.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct term is dishabituation. Because it's about the system being so fast that it doesn't adapt, so the child can't recognize the new image.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the definitions.

Dishabituation: The nervous system becomes so fast that new information is perceived as new, but it's undetectable. So the child can't recognize the shuttle because it's too new.

Perceptual set: The person's existing way of perceiving is fixed, so even when new images come, they can't change. So she can't recognize the shuttle when it comes.

The question says she couldn't recognize it the first time, then couldn't recognize it again when it was flying. So it's about not adapting to it.

So dishabituation is when the system becomes so fast that it can't adapt. So the correct answer would be dishabituation, which is option A.

But wait, sometimes dishabituation is seen as a case where the system is too fast to adapt, so the child can't recognize the new image because the system is stuck in the old way.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct term is illusory recognition. But the options don't include that.

So, based on the options, dishabituation would be the answer.

The question describes a scenario where Young Tina couldn't recognize a space shuttle picture the first time it appeared and then couldn't recognize it again when it was flying. This situation best fits the concept of dishabituation, where the nervous system becomes too fast to adapt to new information, leading to the inability to recognize the shuttle.
