Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about human amino acid requirements. Let me think through each option step by step. The question is asking which statement is correct regarding human nutrition. 

First, I remember that amino acids are essential for building and maintaining the body, and their needs vary with age. So the question is about which statements are correct in terms of assuming certain patterns for all ages or specific age groups.

Looking at the options:

A: The amino acid requirements for adults are assumed for all ages. Hmm, I don't think that's correct. I remember that children and older adults have different needs. Like, kids might need more proteins and different amino acids than adults. So A is probably wrong.

B: Breast milk's amino acid pattern is for all children. Wait, I think breast milk doesn't have all the proteins that adults need. Like, it might have less protein overall or different amino acid ratios. So this statement might be incorrect because it suggests that breast milk is the same as adult needs for all children, which isn't true.

C: Infants' amino acid requirements are maintenance for all ages. No, that doesn't sound right. Infants probably require more than just maintenance; they might have higher needs for certain amino acids. For example, older tissues need more amino acids, so infants' requirements might be more specific, not for all ages.

D: Animal protein's amino acids are for adults. No, animal proteins are for all ages. I think plant-based proteins are for all ages, but animal proteins are for adults, and children might have different needs. So D is incorrect.

E: Human tissue protein's amino acids for all ages. Wait, I remember that human tissue proteins are for all ages because they're a part of the body and adults use them as well. So E might be correct. But wait, the option says "all ages" but I'm not sure. Does human tissue protein require all ages? I think tissue proteins are for adults, but maybe children's proteins require maintenance? Not sure. Let me think.

F: Adults' amino acids are for all ages. No, because children have different needs. Adults may have higher requirements, but children have lower. So F is incorrect.

G: Human tissue protein is for infants and young children. That seems incorrect because I think all ages need it, and children might have specific needs, but the statement is saying tissue proteins are for all, which isn't correct unless it's maintenance. Or perhaps I'm mixing up maintenance and all ages.

Wait, let me clarify each option again.

Wait the options are statements about assuming patterns for certain groups. So for example, option B says that breast milk's amino acid pattern is for all children. I think breast milk doesn't have all the amino acids that adults need. So option B is wrong.

Option E says human tissue proteins are for all ages. I think that's correct because human tissue proteins are a part of the body and adults use them. But I'm not entirely sure. I think that's correct because tissue proteins are for all ages. For example, children's tissues might have slightly different protein requirements, but generally, human tissue proteins are for all ages.

Wait the wording is "assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages." So the statement is that they are required for maintenance for all ages. Or perhaps they are for all ages as maintenance.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is that human tissue proteins are maintained for all ages. Or perhaps they are for all ages.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each statement.

Option E: "The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages." Or, is the statement that tissue proteins are for all ages? Or is it that they are for maintenance for all ages?

Wait, the statement is "assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages." So the pattern is for all ages. Or is it maintenance for all ages?

Let me think about the actual scenario. I know that human tissue proteins (like in the body's cells) are required for maintenance in all ages. So option E says "maintenance for all ages" â€“ that seems correct. Because maintenance is ongoing, and tissues are needed for all ages.

Wait, but the question is about the assumption. Let me check the options again.

Looking for the correct statement where the amino acid pattern is assumed to apply to all ages.

Option E says, "human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement for maintenance for all ages." Or perhaps "all ages" as the basis.

Wait, no, the exact wording is option E: "The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages." So it's saying the pattern applies to all ages. I think that's correct because tissue proteins are needed for all ages.

But wait, another option is H: breast milk's pattern is for all adults. But I think breast milk doesn't have all the amino acids needed by adults. So H is incorrect.

Wait, what about option G: "pattern for infants and young children." That doesn't sound right. Because I think human tissue proteins are for all ages, including children, though they might have lower requirements. So G is incorrect.

Wait, then which option is correct?

Back to the options. Let me go through each again.

Option E: Tissue proteins for all ages.

Option G: Tissue proteins for infants and young children.

If E is correct, then E is the correct answer, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Another approach: let me think of the general rule. For example, plant-based proteins are for all ages (since they're for maintenance in children and young kids too), while animal proteins are for adults. Tissue proteins are also for all ages because they're part of the body's maintenance.

Wait, but I think human tissue proteins are for all ages. So E is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option E: "Assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages."

Wait, the statement is that the pattern is for all ages. So the correct statement would be that human tissue proteins have the same pattern (requirement) for all ages.

So the correct answer would be E.

But wait, let me think about the statement again. The statement is "assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages." So if the correct statement is that human tissue protein is required for all ages, then E is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because I think human tissue proteins are for all ages, so E is correct.

Alternatively, what about option G: the statement says the pattern is for infants and young children. I don't think that's correct because human tissue proteins are used by all ages, including children.

So the correct statement is E. So the answer must be E.

To determine the correct statement about human amino acid requirements, let's analyze each option carefully:

- **Option A**: The amino acid requirements for adults are assumed to be for all ages.  
  This is incorrect because children and older adults have different needs for amino acids. For example, children require more proteins and different amino acids than adults.

- **Option B**: The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be for all children.  
  This is incorrect because breast milk lacks essential amino acids that adults require in higher amounts.

- **Option C**: The amino acid requirements for infants are assumed to be for maintenance for all ages.  
  This is incorrect because infants require more specific amino acids than maintenance for all ages.

- **Option D**: The amino acid pattern of animal protein is assumed to be for adults.  
  This is incorrect because animal proteins are required for all ages, not just adults.

- **Option E**: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be for all ages.  
  This is correct. Human tissue proteins are essential for the maintenance of all body tissues across all ages, making them required for all ages.

- **Option F**: The amino acid requirements determined for adults are assumed to be for maintenance for all ages.  
  This is incorrect because the requirements for adults are not for maintenance for all ages.

- **Option G**: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be for infants and young children.  
  This is incorrect because human tissue proteins are required for all ages, including infants and young children.

- **Option H**: The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be for all adults.  
  This is incorrect because breast milk lacks essential amino acids that adults require.

- **Option I**: The amino acid requirements for the elderly are assumed to be for maintenance for all ages.  
  This is incorrect because the elderly require specific amino acids, not for maintenance for all ages.

- **Option J**: The amino acid requirements determined for children are assumed to be for all ages.  
  This is incorrect because children have different amino acid requirements than adults.

The correct statement is **Option E**, as human tissue proteins are required for all ages, including children and young adults.
