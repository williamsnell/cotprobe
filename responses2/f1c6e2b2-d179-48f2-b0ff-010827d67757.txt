Okay, so I have this question about a stock split. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about Alto Co. which split its common stock on July 1. The details are that the split was 5 for 1 when the fair value was $100 per share. Before the split, Alto had 10,000 shares with a par value of $10 each. After the split, they ask what the new par value is.

Hmm, I remember that a stock split increases the number of shares outstanding and decreases the par value per share. The split ratio is given as 5 for 1, which means for every 5 shares a shareholder owns before the split, they'll get 1 share after. So the total number of shares will decrease.

Wait, the fair value part is probably a red herring here because the question is about the par value, not the market value or something else. Oh right, the par value is fixed, so the split doesn't change the par value per share; it just changes the number of shares.

So, before the split, the number of shares is 10,000. After a 5 for 1 split, each original share becomes 5 shares. So the new number is 10,000 * 5 = 50,000 shares. But the question is about the par value, not the number of shares. So the par value doesn't change. It's still $10 per share.

Wait, but wait. Does the par value stay the same or does it change? Oh, right, in stock splits, the par value is reduced. So the original par value was $10. After a 5 for 1 split, each original share becomes 5 shares, so the par value per share is divided by 5. So 10 /5 = $2 per share. Oh wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the par value is the minimum value a share can have. So when you split 5 for 1, the number of shares goes up, but the par value per share goes down. So the original par value is $10. After splitting into 5 shares, each share would have a lower par value.

Wait, but the question says "the par value of the stock." Before the split, each share was $10. After the split, each share is now 1/5 of the original par value. So the new par value is $10 /5 = $2. So after the split, each share has a par value of $2, so the total number of shares increases to 50,000. But the par value per share is $2.

Wait, but the question is about the par value of the stock after the split, which is the per share. So it's reduced from $10 to $2, which is a reduction of 8 dollars. So the new par value is $2 per share.

Looking back at the options, let's see which one corresponds. Option I says "Was reduced to $2." That's right. Option B says remained the same, which isn't correct. Option A is $4, which is 10/2.5. Option C is $20, which would be 10*2, which is not right. Hmmm, let's think again. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. The split is 5 for 1, so the par value per share decreases by a factor of 5. So 10 /5 = $2. So the par value is reduced to $2. So the answer should be option I: was reduced to $2.
</think>

The stock split increases the number of shares but does not change the par value per share. The split ratio is 5 for 1, meaning each original share is converted into 5 new shares. Since the par value of $10 is reduced by a factor of 5, the new par value per share is $2. 

Answer: I. Was reduced to $2.
