Question:

Universal Fur is located in Clyde, Baffin Island, and sells high-quality fur bow ties throughout the world at a price of $5 each. The production function for fur bow ties (q) is given by q = 240x - 2x^2, where x is the quantity of pelts used each week. Pelts are supplied only by Dan's Trading Post, which obtains them by hiring Eskimo trappers at a rate of $10 per day. Dan's weekly production function for pelts is given by x = \sqrt{l}, where l represents the number of days of Eskimo time used each week. For a quasi-competitive case in which both Universal Fur and Dan's Trading Post act as price-takers for pelts, what will be the equilibrium price (p_x) for pelt?

Okay, so I have this economics problem here about the equilibrium price of pelt for Universal Fur. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Sometimes I get a bit stuck, but I'll take it slow.

So, the problem says that Universal Fur sells fur bow ties for $5 each. The production function for the bow ties is q = 240x - 2x², where x is the quantity of pelts used each week. Now, the pelts are supplied by Dan's Trading Post. They get them by hiring trappers, which cost $10 per day. The weekly production function for pelts is x = √l, where l is the number of days of skimmable time used each week.

The question is asking for the equilibrium price (p_x) of pelt in a quasi-competitive (perfectly competitive) market where both Universal Fur and Dan's Trading Post are price-takers. The options are from A to J, but I'll work through it.

First, I remember that in a competitive market, the price of the product should equal the marginal cost of production for the seller. So, for Universal Fur, the price p will be equal to the marginal cost (MC) of producing the bow ties. But wait, the problem is about the pelt, so maybe I need to think about Dan's Trading Post's costs.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The price p is given as $5 for the bow tie. But we're looking for the equilibrium price of pelt (p_x), not the price of the tie. So, the pelt's equilibrium price depends on Dan's Trading Post's production costs.

Dan's Trading Post is a price-taker, so they maximize profit by setting the price equal to their marginal cost. So, I need to find Dan's marginal cost of producing pelts.

The production function for pelts is x = sqrt(l). Wait, that's x squared equals l, or l = x². So, l is the number of days of skimmable time, which means the amount of labor (l) used per week. The cost of labor is $10 per day. So, total cost (TC) for Dan's Trading Post would be the cost of labor. Since each day is $10, the daily cost is 10*l. But l is x², so TC = 10 * x².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem states that trappers are hired at $10 per day. So, for each day of skimmable time, they pay $10. So, if l is the number of days used, their cost is 10*l. But l is sqrt(x) because x = sqrt(l). So l = x². Therefore, TC = 10 * x².

Wait, but wait, x is the quantity of pelts used. So, for x pelts, they need to use l = x² days. So total cost is 10 * x².

So, the marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of TC with respect to x. So, MC = d(TC)/dx = 20x.

Wait, but marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. So, if x = sqrt(l), and l is the number of skimmable days, then to produce each additional x, how much does it cost? Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, let's think about the production function for pelts. x = sqrt(l), which can be rewritten as l = x². So, if they produce x pelts, they use x² days of labor. The cost for labor is 10 per day, so total cost is 10 * x².

Now, marginal cost is the derivative of total cost with respect to x. So, d(10x²)/dx = 20x. So, MC = 20x.

But since in a competitive market, the price of the product (which is the price of the output, which is the price of the tie) is equal to the marginal cost for the seller. Wait, but wait, the tie's price is given, but that's not directly relevant here. The pelt's price is determined by the seller's (Dan's Trading Post) cost.

Wait, but the tie's price is $5. So, the seller for the tie (Universal Fur) sells each tie for $5. But the question is about the equilibrium price of pelt (p_x). So, the pelt's price is determined by the cost structure of Dan's Trading Post.

Wait, but wait, the tie's price is $5, so the revenue for Universal Fur per tie is $5. But since Universal Fur is a price-taker, their price for the tie is fixed, but this doesn't directly affect the cost structure of Dan's Trading Post. So, the pelt's price (p_x) is determined by Dan's Trading Post's marginal cost.

Wait, but I thought Universal Fur sets the price for the tie, which is $5, but that's the price per tie. But the pelt's price is what we're looking for. Oh, wait! Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in the problem statement, Universal Fur sells the bow ties for $5 each. The production function for the bow ties is q = 240x - 2x², where x is the number of pelts per week. So, for each tie, Universal Fur needs x pelts. So, their revenue per tie is $5, but the cost would be the cost of the pelts, which is p_x * x.

Wait, but wait, the problem is only about p_x for pelt. So, the production of bow ties depends on the pelt, but the tie's price is given. So, the pelt's price is determined by the marginal cost of producing the bow ties. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the tie's price is fixed at $5, but that doesn't determine the pelt's price. Instead, the pelt's price is determined by the cost structure of Dan's Trading Post, which makes sense because Dan is a supplier of pelt to Universal Fur. So, the pelt price is determined by the marginal cost of producing x pelts, which is 20x, as I found earlier.

Wait, but that can’t be right, because the tie's price is $5. So perhaps I need to model the supply and demand for pelt. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the tie's price is $5, so the revenue for Universal Fur per tie is $5, but they can only make as much as they can produce. Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, it's about the equilibrium price of pelt, so perhaps it's determined by the cost of producing the pelt for the tie.

Alternatively, perhaps the pelt's price is the same as the tie's price, but that doesn't make sense because the tie is a separate product. So, perhaps I need to think about the production of bow ties and the pelt used, which affects the price of the tie.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a supply and demand for pelt, where the supply comes from Dan's Trading Post, and the demand is from Universal Fur's customers.

Wait, but without knowing Universal Fur's demand for pelt, it's hard to model. Oh wait, universal fur is a supplier of the bow tie, but perhaps the tie's price is a function of the pelt's price. Let me think.

Wait, no, the tie's price is given as $5. So, perhaps the tie's price is the revenue from selling each tie, which depends on the pelt input. So, the price at which Universal Fur sells each tie would be the revenue per tie divided by the number of pelt pieces per tie. But wait, the problem states that the tie's price is $5. So, perhaps the tie's price is the revenue per tie, which is (price of tie) = (price of pelt per tie) * (number of pelt per tie). But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the tie's price is the revenue per tie, and the pelt needs to be paid for, so the revenue per tie includes the cost of the pelt.

Wait, perhaps the tie's price is the revenue for Universal Fur, which is p_tie * q_tie. But q_tie is the number of ties sold, which depends on the pelt used. Since q_tie = x, the number of pelt pieces, then perhaps the revenue per tie is p_tie * x. But wait, that would make the total revenue p_tie * x, but the tie's price is given as $5, so maybe p_tie = 5. So, that would mean the tie's price is $5 per tie, which would be the price of the tie, and the revenue per tie is 5 * q_tie, where q_tie is x. So, the revenue is 5x, which should equal the cost of the pelt, which is p_x * x. So, 5x = p_x * x. So, p_x = 5. But that can't be right because then p_x is $5, and that's not one of the options. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the tie's price is the price per tie, which is $5, but that doesn't directly relate to the pelt's price. So, perhaps the tie's price isn't the same as the pelt's price. Maybe the tie's price is the revenue from selling each tie, which is p_tie = 5, but the pelt's price is the cost per pelt, which is p_x.

Wait, so the tie's price is 5 dollars. So, if Universal Fur sells each tie for $5, then the revenue per tie is $5. But the cost per tie is the cost of the pelt and any other materials used. So, the tie's price is the revenue minus the cost. But wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe the tie's price is the price per tie, which is $5, and the pelt's price is derived from the cost of producing the pelt. But I'm not sure how that ties into the equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply about the supply of pelt. Since Dan's Trading Post is a price-taker, their supply curve is based on their marginal cost. So, the supply of pelt is q_s = x, and the demand is determined by Universal Fur's demand.

Wait, but without knowing Universal Fur's demand, I can't find the equilibrium. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. The problem states that the pelt's price is determined by the marginal cost of production. So, maybe I should model the supply of pelt as being based on Dan's Trading Post's costs.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's reevaluate.

Dan's Trading Post is a supplier of pelt. The production function for them is x = sqrt(l), where l is the number of days of skimmable time, and the cost per day is $10.

So, the cost to produce x pelt is 10 * l. But l = x², so cost is 10 * x². So, the cost function for Dan's Trading Post is C(x) = 10x².

The marginal cost is the derivative of C(x) with respect to x, which is 20x. So, MC = 20x.

In a competitive market, the price of pelt (p_x) is equal to the marginal cost. So, p_x = MC = 20x. But x is the quantity of pelt produced. So, p_x = 20x.

But this equation would hold when the pelt's price equals the marginal cost. However, I'm not sure how this connects to the tie's price given as $5.

Wait, perhaps the tie's price is $5, which is the revenue per tie. The tie's revenue is p_tie = 5. If the tie is produced using x pelt pieces, then the total revenue is 5 * x. The cost of pelt is p_x * x. So, the profit per tie would be revenue minus cost: 5x - p_x x.

But since Universal Fur is a price-taker, their profit per tie would be zero. So, 5x - p_x x = 0 → p_x = 5.

Wait, that can't be right because then p_x would be $5, which isn't an option. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the tie's price is the price of the tie, which is $5, but the pelt's price is the cost of the pelt, which is p_x.

Wait, perhaps the tie's price is the revenue from selling each tie, which is p_tie = p_x * x. But the tie's price is given as $5, so p_x * x = 5. But then p_x = 5 / x. But x is the quantity of pelt used per week. But x is also the number of pelt pieces used to make the bowtie, right?

Wait, no, the production function is q = 240x - 2x², where x is the quantity of pelt used each week. So, each tie uses x pelt pieces, so the number of ties per week would be q, and the total pelt used is q * x. So, the total pelt used is q * x, which is (240x - 2x²) * x = 240x² - 2x³.

But that's the total pelt used, which would be equal to the pelt supplied by Dan's Trading Post. So, the supply of pelt from Dan's Trading Post is q_s = 240x - 2x².

But Dan's Trading Post's cost is 10x², because l = x², and each day costs $10, so total cost is 10 * x².

Wait, but in a competitive market, p_x is equal to marginal cost, so p_x = 20x.

Wait, but x is the per week pelt used. So, p_x = 20x.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should set up equations.

Equilibrium occurs when p_x = MC. So, p_x = 20x.

But the total pelt used per week is 240x - 2x². So, the supply curve is q_s = 240x - 2x².

But wait, no. The quantity supplied is the total pelt used. So, q_s = 240x - 2x².

But since p_x = 20x, x = p_x / 20.

Substituting into q_s:

q_s = 240*(p_x/20) - 2*(p_x/20)^2.

Simplify:

q_s = 12p_x - 2*(p_x² / 400)
= 12p_x - (p_x²)/200.

But this is the supply curve. Now, the demand for pelt would come from Universal Fur.

Wait, Universal Fur sells each tie for $5. The tie's revenue is 5 per tie, and the cost per tie (for pelt) is p_x * x. But x is the number of pelt pieces used each week. Wait, let's clarify: The tie uses x pelt pieces, each piece costing p_x, so the cost per tie is x * p_x. The revenue is 5 per tie. So, profit per tie would be 5 - x p_x.

Set profit to zero for equilibrium: 5 - x p_x = 0 → x p_x =5 → x = 5 / p_x.

So, the demand for pelt is x =5/p_x.

But x is the number of pelt pieces used per week, which relates to the supply from Dan's Trading Post.

So, the supply curve from Dan's is q_s = 240x - 2x², and the demand curve is x =5/p_x.

Wait, but in equilibrium, q_s = x, because the entire supply is used by Universal Fur.

Wait, no. The supply from Dan's Trading Post is q_s =240x - 2x². But since each tie uses x pelt pieces, and Universal Fur sells q_tie ties, then q_s = q_tie * x.

But Universal Fur sells q_tie ties, each using x pelt. So, the total pelt used is q_tie * x = q_tie * x.

But q_tie is the number of ties sold, and the total pelt used is the same as the total pelt supplied by Dan's Trading Post.

So, the demand for pelt is x =5/p_x.

So, the supply from Dan's Trading Post is q_s =240x - 2x². But since q_s is the number of pelt pieces supplied, which is the same as the quantity used by Universal Fur, which is q_tie * x = q_tie * x.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to model it.

At equilibrium, the pelt supplied by Dan's Trading Post (q_s) equals the pelt used by Universal Fur (q_tie * x). So, q_s = q_tie * x.

But q_tie is the number of ties sold, which is the number of pelt pieces per tie, which is x. So each tie uses x pelt pieces, so q_tie is the number of ties, but q_tie * x is the total pelt used. So, if x is the pelt per tie, then q_s = q_tie * x.

But the quantity supplied by Dan's Trading Post is q_s = 240x - 2x², as per their production function.

Wait, but wait, no. The production function for pelt is x = sqrt(l), so l = x². The cost is 10 * l = 10 x². So, the marginal cost is 20x.

So, in equilibrium, the price p_x is equal to the marginal cost. So p_x = 20x.

But x is the pelt used per tie. Each tie uses x pelt. So, the quantity of pelt used per week is x (per tie) multiplied by the number of ties sold in a week.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Universal Fur sells each tie for $5, which comes from the revenue from pelt. The tie's revenue is 5 per tie, which must come from the pelt used.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the revenue from pelt.

Each tie uses x pelt pieces. So, the revenue from pelt is x p_x per tie.

So, revenue per tie is x * p_x.

But the tie's price is $5, which comes from the revenue, so x * p_x =5.

So, x =5/(p_x).

But the pelt used per tie is x, so the quantity of pelt used per week is q_tie * x. But q_tie is the number of ties, which is q_tie = q / x, where q is the number of pelt pieces used per week.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to set up the supply and demand for pelt.

The supply (from Dan's Trading Post) is the total pelt used, which is q_s =240x -2x², where x is the pelt used per tie.

The demand for pelt is from Universal Fur, which is x =5/p_x.

At equilibrium, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. So, q_s = q_d.

q_d = x =5/p_x.

So, q_s =240x -2x² =5/p_x.

But x is 5/p_x, so substituting:

240*(5/p_x) - 2*(5/p_x)^2 =5/p_x.

Let me compute each term:

240*(5/p_x) = 1200/p_x.

-2*(5/p_x)^2 = -2*(25/p_x^2) = -50/p_x^2.

So, the equation becomes:

1200/p_x -50/p_x^2 =5/p_x.

Multiply both sides by p_x^2 to eliminate denominators:

1200 * p_x -50 =5 p_x.

So, 1200 p_x -50 =5 p_x.

Subtract 5 p_x from both sides:

1195 p_x -50 =0.

So, 1195 p_x =50.

Divide both sides by 1195:

p_x =50/1195 =10/239 ≈0.0418.

But that's not one of the options, which are all in hundreds. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Let me try again.

The tie's price is $5, which is the revenue per tie. So, the revenue per tie is p_tie =5.

So, if each tie uses x pelt pieces, then the revenue from pelt per tie is x * p_x.

So, x * p_x =5.

Thus, x =5/(p_x).

Now, the supply of pelt from Dan's Trading Post is q_s =240x -2x².

But the quantity supplied is also the quantity of pelt used by Universal Fur, so q_s = x (number of ties) * x (pelt per tie).

Wait, no, that's not correct. q_s =240x -2x² is the quantity of pelt supplied, which is the same as the pelt used by Universal Fur. So, q_s =240x -2x².

But the pelt used per tie is x, so the number of ties is q_tie = q_s /x.

Wait, I'm getting tangled. Alternatively, perhaps the pelt's price is the cost per pelt, which is p_x. Then, the tie's price is the revenue per tie, which is p_tie = p_x * x. But the tie's price is given as $5, so p_x * x =5 → x =5/p_x.

So, the pelt's price is p_x. The tie's price is p_x * x =5.

So, x =5/p_x.

Now, the supply from Dan's Trading Post is q_s =240x -2x². But q_s is the pelt used, which is the same as x * q_tie.

Wait, no, q_s is the total pelt used for the week. So, the total pelt used is q_s =240x -2x².

But x =5/p_x, so substituting:

q_s =240*(5/p_x) -2*(5/p_x)^2.

q_s =1200/p_x - 50/p_x^2.

But in equilibrium, the supply from Dan's Trading Post equals the demand from Universal Fur. The demand from Universal Fur is x, which is 5/p_x.

Wait, no, wait. The demand for pelt is the number of pelt pieces used, which is q_s =240x -2x².

But the demand is also x =5/p_x.

Wait, so the demand for pelt is x =5/p_x, and the supply is q_s =240x -2x².

At equilibrium, q_s = x.

So, 240x -2x² =x.

Bring everything to one side:

240x -2x² -x =0 →239x -2x²=0.

Factor out x:

x(239 -2x)=0.

So, x=0 or x=239/2=119.5.

Since x can't be zero, x=119.5.

But x is in pelt pieces per week. So, x=119.5.

Now, using x=119.5, we can find p_x.

Wait, but p_x is the price per pelt. The tie's price is 5, which is tied to the pelt's price.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between the tie's price and the pelt's price.

Let me try again, perhaps I should model the tie's price as the revenue per tie, which is p_tie = p_x * x.

But the tie's price is given as $5, so p_x * x =5.

So, x =5/p_x.

Now, the supply of pelt from Dan's Trading Post is q_s =240x -2x².

But the demand for pelt is the number of pelt pieces used, which is x.

Wait, no, the demand would be the pelt used by Universal Fur. Wait, no, the demand for pelt is the pelt used by Universal Fur. So, the total pelt used is q_s =240x -2x².

But the pelt used by Universal Fur is x, so q_s =240x -2x² =x.

So, 240x -2x² =x →239x -2x²=0 →x(239 -2x)=0.

So, x=0 (ignore) or x=239/2=119.5.

So, x=119.5.

Now, from x =5/p_x → p_x =5/x =5/119.5 ≈0.0418.

Again, this is not one of the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the tie's price is the revenue, which is p_tie = p_x * x =5. So, p_x =5/x.

And the supply from Dan's Trading Post is q_s =240x -2x².

But the supply is also the pelt used by Universal Fur, which is x, so q_s = x.

Wait, no, q_s is the pelt used, which is the same as the pelt used per tie times the number of ties. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the tie's price is the revenue, which is 5, and the pelt's price is the cost, which is p_x.

So, the tie's revenue is p_x * x =5 →x=5/p_x.

The supply of pelt from Dan's Trading Post is q_s =240x -2x².

At equilibrium, q_s =x →240x -2x² =x →239x -2x²=0 →x=0 or x=239/2=119.5.

So, x=119.5.

Then, p_x =5/x =5/119.5 ≈0.0418.

But again, that's not in the options. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the production function.

Wait, let me double-check the production function.

The production function is x = sqrt(l), so l =x².

The cost function is C(x) = 10 * l =10 x².

The marginal cost is MC = dC/dx =20x.

At equilibrium, p_x = MC → p_x=20x.

But we also have from the tie's price:

x =5/p_x.

Substitute into p_x=20x:

p_x=20*(5/p_x) →p_x=100/p_x →p_x²=100 →p_x=10.

Ah, that makes sense. So, p_x=10.

Wait, but earlier when I substituted x=5/p_x into p_x=20x, I got p_x=100/p_x, leading to p_x=10. So, that's the correct approach.

So, the correct answer is C) 10.
</think>

To determine the equilibrium price of pelt (p_x), we analyze the supply and demand dynamics in the market. 

### Key Steps:

1. **Production Function and Costs**:
   - The production function is \( x = \sqrt{l} \), where \( l \) is the number of days of skimmable time.
   - The cost function is \( C(x) = 10x^2 \), derived from the total labor cost \( 10 \times l \).
   - The marginal cost (MC) is \( \frac{dC}{dx} = 20x \).

2. **Equilibrium Condition**:
   - At equilibrium, the pelt price \( p_x \) equals the marginal cost: \( p_x = MC = 20x \).

3. **Tie's Price Constraint**:
   - The tie's price is $5, which is the revenue from pelt. The revenue from pelt is given by \( p_x \times x = 5 \), leading to \( x = \frac{5}{p_x} \).

4. **Substitution into MC**:
   - Substitute \( x = \frac{5}{p_x} \) into \( p_x = 20x \):
     \[
     p_x = 20 \left( \frac{5}{p_x} \right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_x^2 = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_x = 10.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The equilibrium price of pelt is **10**, which corresponds to option **C**.

ANSWER: C) 10
