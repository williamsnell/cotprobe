Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. The question is about finding the pH of a solution where the hydrogen ion concentration is 2.7 times 10 to the power of -6 M. Hmm, I remember that pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution, and it's calculated using the formula pH = -log[H+]. Wait, so the concentration here is H+.

Wait, the H+ concentration is given as 2.7e-6 M. So the formula would be pH equals the negative logarithm (base 10) of that concentration. Let me think about how to calculate the log of 2.7e-6.

I know that log(2.7) is approximately 0.4314 because I remember that log(2) is about 0.3010 and log(3) is about 0.4771. So 2.7 is between 2 and 3, so the log is a little more than 0.43. But I think a more precise value would be needed here.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate log(2.7). Let me think: 2.7 is 27/10, so log(27) - log(10). Log(27) is log(3^3) which is 3*log(3) ≈ 3*0.4771=1.4313. So log(27)=1.4313. Then log(2.7) is log(27)-1= 1.4313 -1.0=0.4313. So that's about 0.4313.

But wait, the actual H+ is 2.7e-6, so the exponent is negative. So the log of 2.7e-6 is log(2.7) + log(1e-6). Oh right, because when you have log(ab)=log a + log b. So log(2.7e-6) = log(2.7) + log(1e-6). Log(1e-6) is -6. So adding that, 0.4313 + (-6) equals -5.5687. So the pH would be -log[H+], so that's -(-5.5687) = 5.5687. Rounded to two decimal places, that's approximately 5.57.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.57. So the correct answer should be B.

To calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of \( [H^+] = 2.7 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \), we use the formula:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]
\]

1. Calculate \( \log[2.7 \times 10^{-6}] \):
   - \( \log(2.7) \approx 0.4313 \) because \( \log(2.7) = \log(3) - \log(10/3) \approx 0.4771 - 0.1761 = 0.3010 \) (but for better precision, \( \log(2.7) \approx 0.4313 \)).
   - \( \log(10^{-6}) = -6 \).
   - Therefore, \( \log(2.7 \times 10^{-6}) = 0.4313 - 6 = -5.5687 \).

2. Calculate the pH:
   \[
   \text{pH} = -(-5.5687) = 5.5687
   \]

3. Round to two decimal places, giving \( \text{pH} \approx 5.57 \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: 5.57**
