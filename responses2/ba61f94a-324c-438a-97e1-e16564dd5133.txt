Okay, so I have this question about stopping times and their properties. The question is asking whether T1 + T2, max(T1, T2), and min(T1, T2) are stopping times, given that T1 and T2 are themselves stopping times with respect to a filtration F. I need to determine each of these three statements and assign 1 if they are stopping times or 0 if they're not.

Hmm, first, I should recall what a stopping time is. A stopping time is a random variable T such that for every time n, the event {T ≤ n} is in the sigma-algebra F_n. So, it's a time at which we can observe up to that point, and the event is measurable.

Now, the question is about the sum, max, and min of two stopping times. I remember that for stopping times, certain operations like addition and taking max/min can sometimes result in stopping times, but not always. Let me think about each case.

Starting with T1 + T2. If T1 and T2 are stopping times, then for each n, {T1 + T2 ≤ n} must be in F_n. Can I express this event in terms of F_n? Well, {T1 + T2 ≤ n} is equivalent to the union over all k of {T1 ≤ k} intersected with {T2 ≤ n - k}. Because T1 and T2 are both stopping times, {T1 ≤ k} and {T2 ≤ n -k} are both in F_k and F_{n-k}, respectively. Since the filtration is right-continuous (I think that's a standard assumption), F_k and F_{n-k} are both subsets of F_n. So the intersection is in F_n, and the union over k from 0 to n is also in F_n because it's a countable union of sets in F_n. So T1 + T2 is a stopping time. So the first answer is 1.

Next, the maximum of T1 and T2. Let's denote max(T1, T2) as M. For M to be a stopping time, the event {M ≤ n} must be in F_n for all n. Let's express {M ≤ n} as the intersection over k from 1 to n of {T1 ≤ k} ∪ {T2 ≤ k}. Because if either T1 or T2 is ≤ k, then the maximum is ≤ n. So this is the union over k of {T1 ≤ k} ∪ {T2 ≤ k}. Now, {T1 ≤ k} is in F_k, and {T2 ≤ k} is also in F_k. So the union is in F_k. But for M to be a stopping time, the entire event {M ≤ n} needs to be in F_n. However, the problem is that for each n, the event {M ≤ n} is not necessarily F_n. Wait, maybe I should think about whether all the sets {T1 ≤ k} and {T2 ≤ k} are in F_n for k ≤ n, and then see if their union is in F_n.

Wait, but for each k ≤ n, {T1 ≤ k} is in F_k, which is a subset of F_n because F is a filtration (increasing). Similarly, {T2 ≤ k} is in F_k, which is a subset of F_n. So their union is in F_n. Hence, {M ≤ n} is the union of sets in F_n, so it's in F_n. Therefore, M is a stopping time. So the second answer is 1.

Lastly, the minimum of T1 and T2. Let M be min(T1, T2). Then, {M ≤ n} is equivalent to the event that at least one of T1 or T2 is ≤ n. So this can be written as the union over k from 1 to n of {T1 ≤ k} ∪ {T2 ≤ k}. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. If the minimum is ≤ n, that means at least one of T1 or T2 is ≤ n. So it's the union of {T1 ≤ n} ∪ {T2 ≤ n}. But wait, more precisely, {min(T1, T2) ≤ n} is equivalent to the union over k from 1 to n of {T1 ≤ k} ∪ {T2 ≤ k}. Because for each k <= n, either T1 or T2 could be <= k, and if any of them is <=n, then the minimum is <=n. So the union of all these events is the same as {min(T1, T2) <=n}.

So the event {min(T1, T2) <=n} is the union over k=1 to n of {T1 ≤k} ∪ {T2 ≤k}. Now, each of these sets is in F_k, which is a subset of F_n. So the union is in F_n, hence {M <=n} is in F_n, so M is a stopping time. So the third answer is 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Am I missing anything? Because if T1 and T2 are stopping times, then for each n, the events {T1 <=k} and {T2 <=k} are in F_k. So their union is in F_k, hence in F_n. So yes, the union over k from 1 to n of these sets would be in F_n. So the minimum is a stopping time.

Wait, but another thought: Is the minimum necessarily a stopping time even if T1 and T2 are? Because if T1 and T2 are stopping times, their min is also a stopping time. I think that's right. Because for each n, the event that the minimum is <=n is the union over k=1 to n of {T1 <=k} union {T2 <=k}, which are both in F_n. So their union is in F_n. So yes, M is a stopping time.

Wait, wait, but what about when n is finite? Suppose n is 2. Then for k=1 and k=2. So {T1 <=1} and {T2 <=1}, plus {T1 <=2} and {T2 <=2}.

Wait, but actually, for each k <=n, {T1 <=k} is in F_k, which is a subset of F_n. So when we take the union for k=1 to n, each {T1 <=k} belongs to F_n, so their union is in F_n. So the min is a stopping time.

That makes all three statements yes. So the answer would be 1 for all three, which is option D: [1,1,1].

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think if there's any case where the min or max isn't a stopping time. For example, if T1 and T2 are both stopping times but their min or max isn't. I can't think of a scenario where that would happen. So yes, all three are stopping times.
</think>

The analysis shows that both the minimum and maximum of two stopping times are also stopping times. Therefore, all three statements are true.
