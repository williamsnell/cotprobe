Okay, so I have this question about older workers and their behavior. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is asking what older workers are more likely to do. The options are A to J, each representing different behaviors.

First, I remember that older individuals often face different challenges compared to younger workers. One thing I know is that as people get older, they might have more responsibilities. Maybe they're not as active in their jobs or take breaks more often. I think they might be more likely to take time off work, which makes option A possible. But wait, isn't that more about being absent from work rather than being absent in general? Or maybe the question is implying that being absent is a factor.

Looking at option F, "Be resistant to change." I've heard that as people get older, they sometimes become more resistant to new changes because they're not as young and may not adjust as quickly. That could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the most accurate answer.

Option E is "Be less innovative." I'm not certain about this one. While old workers might have more experience, does that make them less likely to try new things? I think sometimes older people are more confident but maybe less creative. However, I'm not certain if that's a strong point.

Option D says "Be less likely to learn new technology." I'm not sure about this either. Maybe it's more about experience than learning. People with more experience are more likely to learn new things, so being less likely could be true, but I'm not certain.

Option B is "Be more prone to workplace accidents." I recall that older workers might be less accident-prone because they're more physically fit and have a lower chance of getting hurt, which makes them less likely to have accidents. So maybe option B is correct.

Option C is "Be less productive." Productivity can vary, but older workers might experience burnout, leading to less productivity. So that could be a possibility. However, I'm not sure if it's the most accurate answer.

Option G is "Be laid off." I don't think that's true for older workers. They typically stay in their jobs, especially in roles that require a certain level of responsibility. So option G is probably incorrect.

Option H is "Retire early." I don't think that's a correct statement. Retire early is more common in younger generations, especially in places where retirement is a significant part of life. So H seems off.

Option I is "Be less motivated." This seems plausible. As people age, they might face fewer job options or have to manage more responsibilities, leading to a lack of desire to work harder. So I could lean towards this being the correct answer.

Option J is "Be dissatisfied with their jobs." Again, I'm not sure. Dissatisfaction can vary; sometimes older workers might be satisfied with the job they have, especially if it's a stable role. So J might not be accurate.

Putting it all together, the options that seem plausible are A, B, C, I, and J. But wait, let me think about what I know. I think older workers are less likely to take more responsibility, so being absent (A) or being less productive (C) could be correct. Also, they might be less motivated (I), perhaps due to the lack of new opportunities. Being less likely to learn new tech (D) might be true, but I'm not entirely sure. Resistance to change (F) might also be a factor as older people may not adapt as well to change. 

Option B about accidents might be correct because of their fitness level. Option E about being less innovative could be true, but it's less certain. 

I think the most likely correct answers are A, B, C, I, and J. But looking back at the options, the question asks which is the most likely. Now I'm a bit confused because the options are mutually exclusive, so only one is correct. Wait, the question says "older workers are more likely to" select one, so there's only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A: Be absent from work. Because older workers might not take as much leave, or might choose to work more hours. Or maybe they're less likely to be absent because they have more responsibilities. Alternatively, being absent is a possibility, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest point.

Alternatively, I remember that older workers are often more likely to be less productive because they might have to manage more tasks, leading to burnout. So C might be correct. Alternatively, being less motivated could be due to the lack of new opportunities or more responsibilities.

Wait, another angle: older workers are more likely to be less motivated because they have fewer job options or have to balance work and family responsibilities. So that would make I correct. Alternatively, option F says "Be resistant to change," which could be true as well.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall if there's a general consensus. I think older workers are less likely to be absent from work, so maybe A is correct. Or perhaps they're less productive, so C.

Wait, I think I remember that older workers are more likely to be less motivated because they might have fewer job opportunities or have to manage more responsibilities, which leads to feeling undervalued or unfulfilled. So I think option I is the best fit here.

So, the answer should be I: Be less motivated.
