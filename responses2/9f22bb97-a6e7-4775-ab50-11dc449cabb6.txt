Okay, so I have this question about a Jamin refractometer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let's think this through. The question says the two tubes are 30 cm long. One has gas at low pressure and the other a vacuum. When the gas is removed, a shift of 10 fringes is counted with lambda_vac = 6000 Angstroms. I need to find the index of refraction of the gas.

Wait, I remember that the Jamin refractometer measures the index of refraction of a gas. The setup is that you have two glass tubes, one containing the gas and the other a vacuum. When the gas is present, it causes the light to shift. The shift is related to the refractive index of the gas.

The formula I think I need to use is something like the shift causing the fringes. Oh right, the shift S in fringes is proportional to (n - 1), where n is the refractive index of the gas. So, the formula is S = k*(n - 1), where k is a constant related to the refractive index of glass and the wavelength.

Wait, when the gas is in the tube, the light shifts because the refractive index of the gas is different from that of air. So when the gas is removed, the shift stops. The shift caused by the gas is S = (n - 1)* (some constant).

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think the shift is given by S = (n - 1) * ( (2d)/(λ0) ), where d is the distance, and λ0 is the wavelength in vacuum. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact expression.

Wait another approach: The shift is due to the change in refractive index. The amount the fringes shift is proportional to (n - 1) multiplied by some factor. The formula I think is S = (n - 1) * (λ_vacuum / 2d). Wait, I might have that backward.

Wait, let me think again. The shift is the number of fringes you count when the gas is in place. So when the gas is removed, the shift stops. The shift is due to the change in refractive index of the gas. 

I remember that the shift (in fringes) is approximately (n - 1) * (2d)/(λ0). So S = (n-1)*(2d)/(λ0). Let me write that down.

So S is the number of fringes shifted. The given S is 10, λ_vac is 6000 Angstroms, d is 30 cm. But wait, units are important here. Let me convert everything to meters or Angstroms, but Angstroms are 1e-10 meters. Let me think about the units.

Wait, the formula: S = (n - 1) * (2d) / (λ0). So solving for n: (n - 1) = S * λ0 / (2d). So n = 1 + (S * λ0) / (2d).

Wait, but wait, some sources have the formula as S = (n - 1) * 2d / λ0. Let me make sure. Yes, that's correct. So n = 1 + S * λ0/(2d).

But wait, the units. Let me double-check.

The formula: The shift Δn is (n - 1) * (2d)/(λ0). So solving for (n-1) = Δn * λ0 / (2d). Then n = 1 + (Δn * λ0)/(2d).

Wait, but wait, the wavelength should be in the same units as the other terms. Let me make sure about the units of each.

Given: S = 10 fringes. λ0 is 6000 Angstroms, which is 6000 * 1e-10 meters = 6e-7 meters.

d is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters.

So plugging into the formula:

n = 1 + (S * λ0) / (2d) = 1 + (10 * 6000e-10 m) / (2 * 0.3 m).

Let me compute that.

First, compute numerator: 10 * 6e-7 (since 6e-7 is 6000e-10) = 6e-6.

Denominator: 2 * 0.3 = 0.6.

So (6e-6) / 0.6 = 1e-5.

Wait, 6e-6 divided by 0.6 is (6e-6)/(6e-1) )= 1e-5.

So n = 1 + 1e-5.

Which is 1.00001.

Wait, but wait, that's option C. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.00001. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the formula right? Sometimes I get confused with the formula. Let me make sure I have the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of wavelength. The shift S is in fringes, which is proportional to (n - 1) times (wavelength in some unit). Oh wait, another approach: The shift is due to the change in refractive index. The formula I've heard is S = (n - 1) * (2d)/(λ0). So when the gas is there, the shift is S = (n -1) * (2d)/(λ0).

So solving for n: n = 1 + (S * λ0)/(2d). Then yes, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers again:

S is 10, λ0 is 6000 Angstroms (6000 * 1e-10 m = 6e-7 m), d is 0.3 m.

So (10 * 6e-7) / (2 * 0.3) = (6e-6) / 0.6 = 1e-5.

So n is 1.00001. That's option C.

The problem involves determining the index of refraction of a gas in a Jamin refractometer. The setup includes two 30 cm-long tubes, one containing gas at low pressure and the other a vacuum. When the gas is removed, a shift of 10 fringes is counted, with the vacuum wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{vac}} = 6000 \, \text{Å} \). The goal is to calculate the index of refraction \( n \) of the gas.

The relationship between the shift \( S \), the refractive index difference \( (n - 1) \), the distance \( d \), and the vacuum wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{vac}} \) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{(n - 1) \cdot 2d}{\lambda_{\text{vac}}}
\]

Rearranging for \( (n - 1) \):

\[
n - 1 = \frac{S \cdot \lambda_{\text{vac}}}{2d}
\]

\[
n = 1 + \frac{S \cdot \lambda_{\text{vac}}}{2d}
\]

### Substituting the given values:
- \( S = 10 \) fringes
- \( \lambda_{\text{vac}} = 6000 \, \text{Å} = 6000 \cdot 10^{-10} \, \text{m} = 6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \)
- \( d = 30 \, \text{cm} = 0.3 \, \text{m} \)

\[
n = 1 + \frac{10 \cdot 6 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \cdot 0.3}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
10 \cdot 6 \times 10^{-7} = 6 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Then, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.6
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\frac{6 \times 10^{-6}}{0.6} = 1 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Finally, add 1:

\[
n = 1 + 1 \times 10^{-5} = 1.00001
\]

Thus, the index of refraction of the gas is \( 1.00001 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:
