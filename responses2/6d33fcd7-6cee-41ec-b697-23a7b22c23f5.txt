Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question to answer about security threats. Let me read it carefully.

The question is: A/an ___________ is a program that steals your logins & passwords for instant messaging apps. The options are A through J, each with different terms. I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that logins and passwords are sensitive information. So, the term they're looking for is a security exploit or a malicious program that affects them.

Looking at the options:

A: Banking Trojan. That's a malicious program used to steal banking data, but it's more about financial info than logins. So probably not A.

B: Rootkit Trojan. A rootkit is a type of malware that injects itself into a system to perform specific tasks. It's used to gain access to devices, steal data, etc. So this fits because it's stealing logins and passwords.

C: Worm-Downloader. Wait, I think a worm is a program that spreads through a network, but a wormDownloader is specific. I'm not sure if it's the correct term. Maybe I should think again.

D: Keylogging Malware. Keylogging is when you log into an account and then use it to create sensitive data, like passwords. That's used to steal data, but I'm not sure if the term is correct for stealing login/passwords specifically.

E: Backdoor Trojans. Backdoor is a way to access systems without permission. So this is about accessing systems, but not stealing data.

F: Email Spyware. That's a type of software that monitors your email and captures data, but it's not stealing specific login/passwords. It's more about monitoring rather than accessing accounts.

G: Trojan-Downloader. I'm not sure what this is. I think it's similar to a worm, but perhaps refers to a different kind of program. I'm not certain about the exact term.

H: IM – Trojans. Not sure what this stands for. IM could be Internet Message, but I don't think that's a term used for something related to stealing information.

I: Ransom Trojan. That's a type of ransomware, which requires paying a ransom to the infected computer to restore the data. Not about stealing, so probably not I.

J: Infostealer Trojan. Wait, I think this is a term I've heard before. Infostealer is a type of malware that steals login and password information. So this fits the description.

Wait, but I thought B was a rootkit. Let me think again. Rootkit (B) is a program that injects itself into a device and provides access to system services. Worm-Downloader (C) is a type of malware that spreads through a network. So the correct term for stealing logins and passwords is a rootkit because it's a malicious program that can access systems and steal data.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard both terms used in different contexts. Let me double-check. For example, some rootkit programs might be used to steal credentials, while others might be specific to stealing passwords or other sensitive data. But in the context of this question, which is about logins and passwords, rootkit makes sense because it's designed to steal such information.

So the correct answer would be B: Rootkit Trojan. Alternatively, I remember that there's a term called a "rootkit" that can be used for such purposes, but I'm also told that a " worm" can be used for similar purposes but isn't the same. So I think B is the right answer.

The correct answer is B: Rootkit Trojan. Rootkit programs inject themselves into devices to steal access to system resources, including logins and passwords, making them the appropriate term for stealing sensitive information. 

Answer: B
