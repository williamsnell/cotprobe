Alright, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is a plate of crystal quartz. The faces of the plate are perpendicular to the optic axis. They found that a certain amount of sodium light is rotated by this plate. The crystal is 10 cm long, and the solution is 20% maltose. They're asking for the thickness of the quartz plate, but wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen. Calculate the thickness of the quartz plate." Oh, wait, but the plate... wait, no, the question is about a crystal plate. Wait, perhaps I should read the question again.

Wait, the question says: "A plate of crystal quartz cut with its faces perpendicular to the optic axis is found to exactly annul the rotation of the plane of polarization of sodium light produced by a 10 cm length of a 20% solution of maltose. Calculate the thickness of the quartz plate."

Wait, hold on. The plate is the crystal, so why are they asking for the thickness? Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the problem says the plate is cut with faces perpendicular to the optic axis, but perhaps that's just a setup for the problem. The actual calculation is about the rotation of the plane of polarization.

Wait, the question says that the crystal is 10 cm long. Oh, wait, wait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check again. Oh, the problem says, "A plate of crystal quartz cut with its faces perpendicular to the optic axis is found to exactly annul the rotation of the plane of polarization of sodium light produced by a 10 cm length of a 20% solution of maltose."

Wait, so the crystal is 10 cm long, and perhaps we're given the rotation produced by that 10 cm, and we need to find the physical thickness of the crystal.

Wait, no, hold on again. The question is, wait, the problem says the crystal is "exactly annul the rotation". Hmm, perhaps the setup is that the crystal plate is 10 cm in length, and we're to find the thickness of the crystal plate. Wait, but the crystal's faces are perpendicular to the optic axis. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the crystal is a plate, but the length is 10 cm, and the thickness is what's being asked.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about calculating the thickness of the crystal plate based on the rotation observed. Let's think.

The specific rotation of maltose is given as 144 degrees. Wait, but wait, the specific rotation is defined as the rotation produced by a 10 cm column of liquid with a 1 gram/cubic centimeter active substance. So, the specific rotation (d) is measured in degrees.

In this problem, the solution is 20% maltose. So the concentration might not matter here because the specific rotation is given as d for 1g/cm³. Wait, but wait, the solution is 20%? Hmm, but specific rotation is a property of the solution, but the specific rotation value is given for 1g/cm³. So perhaps the solution's concentration (like 20% is the mass/volume) is a distractor, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should proceed as if the specific rotation is 144°, regardless of concentration.

Wait, no, the question states: "the specific rotation is defined as the rotation produced by a 10 cm column of liquid with a 1 gram/cubic centimeter active substance." So the specific rotation (d) is measured for 1 g/cm³. So the active substance's concentration is used in the calculation.

But in this problem, the solution is 20% (mass/volume), but the specific rotation is given for 1g/cm³. Hmm, perhaps the question is just to use the given δ of 144°, regardless of the solution concentration, because the specific rotation is a material property, not dependent on concentration. Or perhaps it's a red herring and the 20% isn't used in the calculation. I'm a bit confused about that, but perhaps for this problem, I can proceed with the specific rotation given.

Wait, but the problem says the crystal's faces are perpendicular to the optic axis, so maybe the plate's thickness is related to the rotation. The rotation is measured when the light passes through the crystal. The rotation angle (θ) is given by the formula θ = d * l * cos²(φ), where d is the specific rotation, l is the path length, and φ is the angle of the light's direction relative to the optic axis. But wait, if the optic axis is perpendicular to the faces, then the light is propagating along the optic axis. Oh wait, but in the case where the crystal's faces are perpendicular to the optic axis, perhaps the light is traveling through the crystal without any refraction, so the angle of propagation (phi) is 0 degrees, so cos(0) is 1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the faces are perpendicular to the optic axis. So the optic axis is along the crystal's face, and the light is propagating through the crystal. Because the faces are perpendicular, the optic axis is in the same direction as the crystal's length.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The setup is, the crystal plate is cut so that its faces are perpendicular to the optic axis. When sodium light is shone through it, the rotation of the plane of polarization is observed. The crystal is 10 cm long. The solution is 20% maltose, but perhaps that's not needed here.

Wait, the problem says that the plate exactly annulates the rotation. Hmm. Maybe it's about the optical activity. The rotation of the plane of polarization is annulated, meaning that the rotation is canceled out. So perhaps the crystal's thickness is such that the rotation is zero. Wait, but that's in the case of a plate that's circularly polarized. Alternatively, perhaps the crystal's thickness is such that when the light passes through it, the rotation is equal to the negative of what you would get for a plate of the same thickness but other properties.

Wait, no, perhaps the setup is that the crystal's thickness is such that the rotation is equal to the specific rotation. So perhaps the formula is δ = n - 1, and the rotation angle is θ = δ * t, where t is the path length, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the problem says that the crystal is 10 cm long. But wait, the rotation is observed when the crystal is of a certain thickness. Oh, perhaps the thickness is the same as the path length. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the crystal's thickness is the same as the length of the column of solution used to cause the rotation. So the length of the column is 10 cm. And because the specific rotation is 144°, the rotation angle θ would be 144° * (10 cm) * some factor.

Wait, but wait, the specific rotation (d) is in degrees per centimeter, I think. Because, for example, specific rotation is usually given as d in degrees per centimeter. Then, the rotation angle θ would be d multiplied by the path length in cm.

Wait, but the problem says the crystal is 10 cm long. So the path length, l, is 10 cm. Then, the specific rotation is 144°, so θ = 144° * 10 cm? That would be 1440°, which doesn't make sense because a rotation is usually in a certain direction, but 1440 is way too high. So maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation is given per gram. Wait, no, the specific rotation is usually a ratio. Wait, perhaps the formula is θ = (d * l) where d is in degrees per cm, and l is in cm. So if d is 144°, and l is 10 cm, then θ would be 1440. That's 1440 degrees, which seems way too high because a rotation shouldn't be that high. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The rotation angle is given by θ = (specific rotation) * (path length) * (cos^2(theta)), but here, if the light is propagating perpendicular to the optic axis (which is the crystal's face), then phi would be 0°, so cos^2(0) is 1. So the formula simplifies to θ = d * l, where l is in centimeters. But then, if d is 144° per cm, and l is 10 cm, then θ would be 1440°, which is impossible because a rotation doesn't go that high. So, that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the unit. Oh, perhaps the specific rotation is in terms of degrees per mm. Alternatively, perhaps the crystal's thickness is such that the rotation is θ= (d * l) where l is in mm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the crystal's thickness is the same as the column length of the solution. But the problem states that the crystal is 10 cm long. Wait, perhaps the crystal's thickness is the same as the column length, which is 10 cm. But then, the calculation would be θ = d * l. But again, 144 * 10 = 1440, which is way too high.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe the problem is about the optical activity, which causes the rotation. The specific rotation (d) is given as 144°. The rotation angle θ is then d multiplied by the path length through the crystal. So θ =d * l. However, the problem states that the crystal is 10 cm long, so l=10 cm. Thus, θ=144 *10=1440 degrees. But that's way too high, and a rotation can't be that high. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the crystal's thickness is such that the rotation θ equals a full rotation of 360°, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the thickness is the same as the path length, but the rotation is measured as a certain angle, and the problem is to find the path length when theta is known.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the rotation is given by theta = (d * l), where d is 144°, and l is the thickness. But then, if the rotation is 10 cm, and d=144, then 10*144=1440. That can't be right. 

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the crystal's thickness is the same as the path length through the solution. So, if the solution is 20% maltose, and the specific rotation is 144°, then the rotation angle is theta = 144 * t, where t is the path length in cm. But the problem says the crystal is 10 cm long. So perhaps the path length is 10 cm, so theta would be 144 * 10 = 1440 degrees, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is theta = (d / 1000) * l, but that seems even worse. Wait, perhaps the specific rotation is in degrees per mm.

Wait, the question says, "specific rotation is defined as the rotation produced by a 10 cm column of liquid with a 1 gram/cubic centimeter active substance." So, maybe if the specific rotation is d, then for a column of l cm, the rotation is theta = (d) * l, but d is in degrees per cm.

So if d is 144°/cm, and l is 10 cm, theta would be 144 *10 = 1440°, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the crystal is of thickness t cm, and the rotation is such that the rotation is theta = (d) * (t) * cos^2(phi), where phi is 0°, so cos^2 is 1. So theta = d * t.

We're told that the crystal is 10 cm long, but that's the path length. Wait, no, the crystal is 10 cm long, so the path length is 10 cm. So if the crystal's thickness is 10 cm, then the rotation would be 144 *10 = 1440°, which is way beyond possible. So that can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps the crystal's thickness is the same as the column length of the solution, which is 10 cm. So t=10 cm. So theta = 144 *10 = 1440°, which again is impossible, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 100 or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation is given per 1 gram per cm³, but the solution is 20% of that. So perhaps the actual specific rotation is 144 *0.2=28.8, but that doesn't make sense because specific rotation is a material property, not dependent on concentration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the crystal's thickness is 10 cm, but the rotation is given by theta = (d) * (t) where d is in degrees per cm.

Wait, but again, that would give theta = 144 *10=1440, which is impossible.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what the question is asking. It says the crystal is 10 cm long, and the rotation is observed. The question is, what is the thickness of the crystal? Wait, but the crystal is 10 cm long, so thickness is the same as length? Or perhaps the crystal is a square prism, and the path length is along the thickness. Hmm, but the problem says the faces are perpendicular to the optic axis, so perhaps the crystal is a square prism with length (thickness) in the optic axis direction.

Wait, perhaps the crystal is 10 cm in one direction (thickness), and the path length through the liquid is 10 cm, so theta = d * t, where t is 10 cm. So theta=144 *10=1440°, which is impossible. Thus, maybe the formula is theta = (d) * (l) /1000, where l is in mm. So 10 cm is 100 mm, so theta=144*100/1000=14.4°. But that doesn't match the options, which are around 1.3 mm or 1.5 mm, etc. So I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation is per 10 cm, so d is 144° per 10 cm. So per cm, d is 14.4°. Then, if the path length is 10 cm, theta=14.4 *10=144°, which matches. But wait, the problem says the crystal is 10 cm long, so perhaps the path length is 10 cm. So theta=14.4 *10=144°, which matches the specific rotation. So the thickness is same as the path length, which is 10 cm, but that's not any of the options. The options are all in mm.

Wait, but perhaps the thickness is 10 cm, which is 100 mm. But none of the options are in mm, except option E is 1.75 mm, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the crystal is a plate, and the path length through it is 10 cm, but the thickness is the same as the path length. So the thickness would be 10 cm, but that's 100 mm, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the rotation is θ = (δ * t * cos^2(φ)) where φ is 0°, so cos^2 is 1. Therefore, θ = δ * t. Now, δ is given as 144 degrees. So θ =144 * t. But wait, θ is in degrees. However, the problem states that the crystal is 10 cm long, but how does that relate to the path length? The path length is 10 cm. So θ =144 *10=1440, which is impossible. So perhaps the path length isn't 10 cm. Or maybe the crystal's thickness is the same as the path length. But the problem states the crystal is 10 cm long, so perhaps the thickness is 10 cm, but that's 100 mm, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the path length is 10 mm. So t=10 mm. Then θ=144 * (10 mm) * (1000 mm/cm) → wait, no, units may be an issue here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ = (δ) * t in the same units. Let's think in cm. So δ is 144°/cm. t is 10 cm. So θ=144*10=1440°, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the rotation is 144°, and the thickness is such that θ = (144) * t, but t is in mm. So 144 * t (mm) = θ (in mm). But since θ can't be more than 360, perhaps the problem is that the rotation is 144 * t, where t is in mm. So, if t=10 mm, θ=1440, which is impossible. So that's not working.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is θ = (δ) * (t) * (1000), but that would give 144 *10 =1440, which is way too high.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to think differently. The problem gives δ=144°, and the crystal's path length is 10 cm. So perhaps the formula is θ = (δ) * (t), where t is in cm. So 144 *10=1440°. But this is impossible, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ = (δ/1000) * t, where t is in cm. So 144/1000 = 0.144, 0.144 *10=1.44°. That's a more reasonable number, but the options aren't matching. Alternatively, perhaps δ is in degrees per mm, so 144/1000 =0.144. Then, if the path length is 10 mm, θ=0.144 *10=1.44°, which is close to option A (1.4 mm), but the options are 1.4 mm, 1.3 mm, 1.2 mm, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the crystal's thickness is the same as the length of the solution column used to cause the rotation, which is 10 cm. So the thickness would be 10 cm, but that's not an option. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to use the specific rotation to find the thickness. So the rotation is θ = (d) * t, but d is in degrees per cm, and t is in cm. So if θ is 144°, then t=144 cm. That's 1.44 meters, which is way too big. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation is 144 per 1000 cm. So d=144/1000=0.144°/cm. Then, θ=0.144 * t, where t is in cm. So if θ is, say, 1.44°, then t=1.44 /0.144=10 cm. But that's the same as the crystal's length, which is 10 cm. But the question is asking for the thickness of the crystal, which is 10 cm, but that's not an option. So perhaps the problem has a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the crystal's thickness is t, and the path length through the crystal is t. So θ = (d) * t, but d is in degrees per cm, so t is in cm. So for example, if d is 144, and t is 1 cm, then θ=144°, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as the optical rotation angle equals (d) * (t). But considering that d is 144°/cm, and t is in cm, then θ=144 * t.

Wait, but again, that leads to a problem. So perhaps the formula is θ = (d * t) /1000. So, θ=144 * t /1000. So, θ=0.144 * t. So, if the problem states that the crystal's thickness is 10 cm, then θ=0.144 *10=1.44°, which is approximately option A (1.4 mm) if the options are in mm. But 1.44 degrees is 144', which is a huge rotation. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the crystal's thickness is t, and the rotation is θ= (d) * (t), but in a different unit system. For example, perhaps the specific rotation is given in degrees per 1000 cm, so 144 degrees per 1000 cm is 0.144 degrees per cm.

So, if the crystal's thickness is t cm, the rotation θ=0.144 *t degrees.

If the problem is that the crystal's thickness is same as the path length, then t=10 cm, θ=1.44 degrees. But the options are in mm. So perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like:

Wait, perhaps the crystal's thickness is 10 cm, and the rotation is measured as θ= (d) * (t) where d=144°/cm. So θ=144 *10=1440°, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is using a formula that the rotation is θ= (d) * (t) / 1000, so 144 *10 /1000=1.44°, which is about 1.4 mm in rotation angle. But that's a rotation of 1.44°, which would correspond to a rotation angle of 1.44 degrees, which would correspond to a rotation of 1.44 *1000 mm, which is 1440 mm, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula θ= (d) * (l) * (1000), so θ=144 *10 *1000=144000000, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the thickness of the crystal required to cause a certain rotation. So, if the crystal's thickness is t, and the rotation is θ= (d) * t. But d is in degrees per cm. So, for example, if the crystal is 10 cm thick, the rotation is 144°, which matches the specific rotation. But the crystal is 10 cm thick, so the thickness is 10 cm, which is 100 mm, but the options are all under 2 mm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be θ = (d) * (t) * (1000), so that 144 * t *1000 = theta, but that can't be right because 144 * t *1000 would be way beyond.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the crystal's thickness is t, and the rotation is θ= (d) * (t) * (1000), which would result in θ=144 *t *1000 degrees, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says that the crystal is 10 cm long, and using that, the rotation is calculated. The question is, what is the thickness of the crystal? Well, the crystal is 10 cm long, so the thickness is 10 cm, but the options are all in mm, which is 10 cm = 100 mm. None of the options match 100 mm. So perhaps the problem is that the crystal's thickness is 10 mm, and the rotation is 1.44°, which would match option A. So, if the crystal is 10 mm thick, then θ= (144/1000) * 10=1.44°, which is approximately 1.4 mm, which is option A. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the problem states that the crystal is 10 cm long, so how can the thickness be 10 mm? That would make the path length 10 cm, and the rotation would be 1.44°, which is 1.44 mm. So that would correspond to option A, which is 1.4 mm.

So, putting it together, the correct answer would be option A:1.4 mm.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the rotation caused by a crystal of thickness \( t \), given a specific rotation \( \delta = 144^\circ \) per centimeter. The crystal is stated to be \( 10 \, \text{cm} \) long, but the thickness \( t \) is to be determined. 

The formula used is:

\[
\theta = \frac{\delta}{1000} \cdot t
\]

where \( \delta = 144^\circ \) per \( 1000 \, \text{cm} \), and \( t \) is in centimeters. Substituting \( \delta = 144^\circ \) and solving for \( t \) when \( \theta \) corresponds to the thickness in millimeters:

\[
t \, (\text{mm}) = \frac{144^\circ}{1000} \cdot (t \, \text{cm}) \cdot 10
\]

Simplifying:

\[
t \, (\text{mm}) = 1.44 \cdot t \, (\text{cm})
\]

For \( t = 1 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
t \, (\text{mm}) = 1.44 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the thickness of the crystal is approximately **1.4 mm**, which corresponds to option **A**.

ANSWER: 1.4 mm
