Okay, so I've got this question about integral domains and their characteristics. Hmm, let's break it down. The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or not, then choose the correct option from A to G.

Statement 1 says: Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite. Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.

I remember that the characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive number of times you have to add the multiplicative identity to itself to get zero. If the characteristic is zero, that means you can't get zero by adding 1 any finite number of times. So, for a ring to have characteristic zero, it can't have a finite number of elements, right? Because if it did, say p, then p would be the characteristic.

Wait, wait. So if an integral domain has characteristic 0, it must have infinitely many elements. Because if it were finite, the characteristic would be some integer, but 0 isn't a positive integer, so it can't be. So Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite. Prime characteristic is a prime number p. For such a ring, if p is the characteristic, then adding 1 p times gives zero. But does that make the ring finite?

Wait, no. Because for example, the ring of integers modulo p is a field and is an integral domain. It has exactly p elements, which is finite. But wait, what about other integral domains with prime characteristic? Like, say, the ring of polynomials over a finite field. No, wait, that's not right. Or maybe a field extension? Wait, no, I'm confused.

Wait, let's think. If a ring has characteristic p, then p is the smallest positive integer such that p*1=0. So the additive group of the ring is a cyclic group of order p. But does that make the ring finite? Not necessarily, because the multiplicative structure could be infinite.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, if the ring has characteristic p, then the additive group has p elements. But the multiplicative group could be infinite. For example, consider the ring Z_p[x], which is the ring of polynomials over the field Z_p. It's an integral domain because Z_p is a field. The additive group is infinite, because polynomials can have any degree. So this ring has characteristic p (since the degree p polynomial is 0 in this case), but the ring itself is infinite. So Statement 2 is false because not every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite; in fact, there are infinitely many.

Wait, wait, no. Because the question says every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite. But the example I just thought of shows that's not the case. So Statement 2 is false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options:

Option E is False, True. So the correct answer would have to be E.

The analysis indicates that Statement 1 is true because integral domains with characteristic 0 must be infinite. Statement 2 is false because there exist integral domains with prime characteristic that are infinite, such as polynomial rings over fields. 

Answer: E
