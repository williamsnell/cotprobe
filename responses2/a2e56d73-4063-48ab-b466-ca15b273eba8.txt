Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the causes of the French Revolution based on the provided article from the "Cahiers of the Third Estate of Versailles" from 1789. The question is asking which of the options is NOT one of the problems that led to the Revolution.

First, I need to recall what the French Revolution was about. From what I remember, the Revolution, also known as the French Revolution, was a period from 1789 to 1799 when the monarchy was replaced by a republic. The key issues that led to this were economic problems, social inequality, and political corruption.

Looking at the article provided, it mentions several articles:

- Article 3 talks about the national assembly and the king's authority over national laws.
- Article 11 is about personal liberty, proprietary rights, and the security of citizens. It also mentions the abolition of cahiers de cachet (which were legal burndosises) forever.
- Article 12 introduces the jury system for criminal trials and civil cases.
- Article 17 removes distinctions in penalties and punishes crimes regardless of the order of the crimes, regardless of the order of the parties involved.
- Article 21 says no taxes are legal unless accepted by the people and by the king.
- Other articles mention issues like religious freedom, political inequality, and the king's corruption.

Now, looking at the options given:

A: Financial problems caused by debts and low revenues. The article doesn't explicitly state this, but I know that the financial crisis was a big problem, leading many people to support the Jacobins, which contributed to the Revolution. So A is a problem that did cause the Revolution.

B: The legal system of France was not equitable. The article mentions the abolition of cahiers de cachet, which was a significant change. Also, Article 17 talks about removing distinctions in penalties, which might imply that the system was more equitable. So B could be a problem that led to the Revolution.

C: Lack of religious freedom in France. The article doesn't specifically mention this, but I remember that the French Revolution was driven by the struggle for religious freedom, as the monarchy's influence was strong. So C is a problem that did cause the Revolution.

D: There was a lot of social and political inequality in France in 1789. This directly relates to the issues like the monarchy's corruption, the Jacobins' rise, and the social unrest. So D is definitely a problem that caused the Revolution.

E: The French monarchy was too weak. The article doesn't directly state this, but I know it was a central issue. However, another point from the article is the abolition of cahiers de cachet, which was a direct response to the monarchy's control. So E might be a problem, but perhaps not the most direct. Alternatively, the monarchy's corruption is another reason.

F: Overpopulation and lack of resources. The article doesn't mention this directly, but it's possible that the monarchy's control over resources (like taxes) led to economic problems. So F could be a problem, but I'm not sure if it's the main one.

G: Low literacy rates. The article doesn't directly address this, but perhaps the lack of resources and inequality affected education. So G could be a problem.

H: France was at war with multiple other nations. The article doesn't mention any wars, so H is probably not a problem.

I: The proliferation of Enlightenment ideals. The Enlightenment was a reaction to the revolution, so the rise of Enlightenment ideas would have been the cause of the Revolution. So I is not a problem, but a cause.

J: The French army was too powerful. The army's power was likely a problem, but I'm not sure if it's the most direct cause. However, the revolution was more about social and political issues than the army.

The question asks which was NOT one of the problems. So looking for the answer that's not a problem.

Option H: France was at war with multiple nations. Since the article doesn't talk about foreign conflicts, this isn't a problem, but it's not a cause either. But the question is about the problems that led to the revolution, so H is not a problem.

Wait, but the options are about what did NOT cause the Revolution. The question is asking which was NOT a problem. So the answer is the one that's not a problem.

The options: H says France was at war with multiple nations. The article doesn't mention any such conflicts, so H is not a problem. So the answer is H.
</think>

The French Revolution was driven by several key issues, including financial problems, social inequality, political corruption, and religious freedom. The provided article does not explicitly discuss war with multiple nations (option H), which was not a problem but also not a cause of the Revolution. Therefore, the answer is:

H: France was at war with multiple nations.
