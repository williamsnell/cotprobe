Question:

Ann, Bea, and Carla were three friends who lived in the same neighborhood. While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement?

Options:

A: Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.
B: Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it.
C: Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.
D: Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about contract law, specifically about consideration and pre-existing obligations. Let me take this step by step.

The scenario is about three friends: Ann, Bea, and Carla. Ann broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. Then Bea loaned her the clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. That week, Bea and Carla had dinner, and Carla owed $4,000 to Ann. Carla didn't have the money, so Bea told Ann she'd contact her to repay on her behalf. They then signed an agreement where Bea would pay $400 a month to return the clubs, and Ann promised to return the clubs too. Wait, no, the written agreement says Bea promised to pay $400 monthly, and Ann promised to return the clubs.

But then, during this agreement, Ann was forbidden to take legal action against Carla, and then Bea repudiated the agreement, and Ann sued Bea. The statute of limitations for Ann's claim against Carla expired the day after she sued Bea. So, Ann's action was pending, but the statute expired, so her claim against Carla was pending.

The question is about whether Bea is liable to Ann under their written agreement. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, what's the issue here? The written agreement between Bea and Ann, which includes the promises Bea made to pay $400 a month, and Ann promised to return the clubs. But Ann was in fact forbearant to sue Carla. The key point is whether Bea's promise to pay was consideration.

Wait, in contract law, consideration is an out-of-pocket exchange of goods or services. If one party gives up something of value and the other receives something of value, that's consideration. If it's just an offer and acceptance without a mutual exchange, it's not considered consideration.

So here, Bea's promise is to pay $400 a month, and Ann is promised to return the clubs. But the clubs are already with Bea. So when she makes the promise to return them, she's giving them to Bea. But the payment is a separate consideration. Or is it?

Wait, the written agreement says Bea promised to pay $400 a month, and Ann promised to return the clubs. So, in this agreement, Bea is offering to pay, and Ann is agreeing to return the clubs. But the clubs are already with Bea. So for consideration, Bea should offer to pay, expecting to get the clubs back. But the clubs are already in hand. So maybe that's not a consideration situation.

Because consideration requires mutual exchange. Bea is offering to pay, and Ann is agreeing to return the clubs. But the clubs are already with Bea. So when Bea offers to pay, she's giving the $400, but Ann is already holding the clubs. So she's not getting the clubs in exchange for the payment. So, perhaps there's no consideration here.

Alternatively, maybe the clubs are in consideration. Because if Bea had to return them, she would have to give them up. But since they're already with Bea, the payment is just a promise to return the clubs, which are already there.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Consideration is when each party gives something of value in exchange for something else. So, for example, if I promise to sell you a widget for $10, and you buy it, that's consideration. Because I gave the widget for $10, and I get the widget in exchange.

In this case, Bea is promising to pay $400 a month, and Ann is promising to return the clubs. But the clubs are already with Bea. So, in this case, the payment is a promise to return the clubs, which were already present. So for Bea's promise, she's offering to give $400, and Ann is agreeing to return the clubs. But since the clubs were already with Bea, she doesn't get the money in exchange for the clubs. So, there's no consideration because she's not exchanging the money for the clubs; she's just promising to return them.

Wait, but the clubs are already with Bea, so she's not getting the clubs in exchange for the payment. So consideration isn't exchanged here. Therefore, Bea's promise isn't consideration, meaning there's no legal consideration.

If that's the case, then Bea isn't liable. Because without consideration, there's no legal obligation for Bea to fulfill her promise.

So looking at the options:

Option A says that Ann didn't promise to forbear to sue, so forbearance wasn't consideration. That makes sense. So A would be correct.

Option C says there was a pre-existing duty to repay. But the pre-existing duty is for Bea to repay the debt. But in the written agreement, Bea's promise is to pay $400, and Ann is promised to return the clubs. But the clubs are already with Bea, so she's not getting the money in exchange. So there's no consideration.

Option B says the written agreement shows a gross imbalance. But if it's about consideration, imbalance doesn't matter. So B is not correct.

Option D says there was a pre-existing duty to return the clubs. But in this case, the clubs are already with Bea. So the pre-existing duty is for Bea to return them, but in the written agreement, she's only promising to return them, not doing so. So D is incorrect.

So the correct argument is A. Because Ann didn't promise to forbear to sue Carla, her forbearance was not consideration. So Bea's promise lacks consideration.

The question revolves around whether Bea is liable to Ann under their written agreement. The key issue is whether Bea's promise to pay $400 monthly constitutes consideration for her promise to return the clubs. Consideration requires a mutual exchange of value. Bea's promise to pay $400 is a promise to return the clubs, but the clubs are already with Bea, meaning there is no exchange of value. Therefore, there is no legal consideration for Bea's promise.

Option A correctly identifies that Ann did not promise to forbear to sue Carla, which would have been consideration if there were an exchange. Without consideration, Bea's promise lacks legal basis.

Other options are either incorrect or less relevant. Option C incorrectly attributes consideration to a pre-existing duty, which does not apply here. Option D incorrectly attributes consideration to a pre-existing duty to return the clubs, which was not part of the written agreement. Option B focuses on an imbalance in promises, which is irrelevant to consideration.
