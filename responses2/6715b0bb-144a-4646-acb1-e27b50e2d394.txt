Okay, so I've got this question about stock valuation. Let me read through it again. The question says that a stock pays a $5 dividend this year and has been growing 6% annually. The required rate of return is 12%, and I need to find the intrinsic value. The options are A to J, each with a different number.

Hmm, I remember that for calculating the intrinsic value of a stock when dividends grow at a constant rate, the Gordon Growth Model (or the dividend discount model with constant growth) is usually applied. The formula for that is P = D1 / (r - g), where D1 is the expected dividend next year, r is the required return, and g is the growth rate.

Wait, but the problem says the dividend has been growing 6% annually. So this year's dividend is D0 = $5. So next year's dividend (D1) would be D0 multiplied by (1 + g), which is 5 * 1.06. Let me calculate that: 5 * 1.06 is 5.30. So D1 is $5.30.

Now, applying the formula: P = 5.30 / (0.12 - 0.06). Let's compute the denominator: 0.12 minus 0.06 is 0.06. So 5.30 divided by 0.06.

What's 5.30 / 0.06? Well, 0.06 times 88 is 5.28, right? Because 0.06 * 80 is 4.8, and 0.06 * 8 is 0.48, so 4.8 + 0.48 is 5.28. So 5.30 is 0.02 more than 5.28. So 0.02 divided by 0.06 is 0.333... So 88 plus 0.333 is approximately 88.333... Or about $88.33.

Looking back at the options, option C is 78.46, which is lower, and option G is 88.33. So the correct answer should be G, 88.33. But wait, did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Let me double-check. Dividends grow at 6% so D1 is 5.30. The required return is 12%, so the discount rate is 12%. So the formula is P = 5.30 / (0.12 - 0.06) = 5.30 / 0.06. Let me compute 5.3 / 0.06. 0.06 goes into 5 how many times? 0.06 * 83 is about 5 (since 0.06 * 80 is 4.8, 0.06 *3 is 0.18, so 83 *0.06=4.98). So 5 / 0.06 is 83.333... But since we have 5.30, it's 5.30 / 0.06. Let's compute 5.30 ÷ 0.06.

Wait, 0.06 * 88 = 5.28. So 5.30 is 0.02 more. 0.06 * 0.333 is 0.02. So total is 88.333... So approximately 88.33. So the intrinsic value should be about $88.33.

Looking at the options, option G is 88.33. So the answer should be G. But wait, the options have H as 110.87, which is higher. Did I get the formula wrong? Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the growth rate. Oh wait, the problem says the dividend has been growing 6% annually. So the growth rate is 6% and the dividend is growing at that rate.

Wait, another thought: sometimes people confuse whether the growth rate is the same as the dividend's growth rate. So the formula is correct.

Wait, another possible mistake could be if I used the required rate of return as the discount rate. I used 0.12, which is correct.

So the calculation leads to $88.33, which is option G.

Looking back at the options, option G is 88.33. So the correct answer is G.

The correct answer is G: 88.33.

The calculation uses the Gordon Growth Model, where the stock's intrinsic value is calculated as:

P = D1 / (r - g)

- D1 is the next year's dividend, which is D0 (current dividend) multiplied by (1 + growth rate): $5 * 1.06 = $5.30.
- r (required rate of return) is 12%, and g (growth rate) is 6%.
- Plugging in the values: P = 5.30 / (0.12 - 0.06) = 5.30 / 0.06 ≈ 88.33.

Thus, the intrinsic value of the stock is approximately $88.33, which corresponds to option G.
