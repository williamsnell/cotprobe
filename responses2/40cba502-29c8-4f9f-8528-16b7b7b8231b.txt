Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the dissociation of HF. Let me see what I remember. HF is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The question gives me the Ka value, which is K_diss = 6.7 × 10^-4. Wait, no, actually, K_diss is likely the acid dissociation constant, Ka. Because I know HF is a weak acid, so Ka is the same as K_a.

The problem says the solution is 0.10 M in HF. I need to find the concentrations of H3O+ (which is H+ ions, or H+ is the hydronium ion) and OH- (the hydroxide ions) in this solution. Oh, right, because it's a weak acid, I should set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).

So the reaction for HF dissociating is HF ⇌ H+ + F-. The initial concentrations are [HF] = 0.10 M, and [H+] and [F-] are 0 because they haven't dissociated yet. Let me let x be the change. So, at equilibrium, [HF] will be 0.10 - x, [H+] is x, and [F-] is x.

The expression for Ka is [H+][F-]/[HF] = (x)(x)/(0.10 - x) = 6.7e-4.

Hmm, solving this quadratic equation. Let me write it out: x² = 6.7e-4 (0.10 - x). So x² = 6.7e-5 - 6.7e-4 x. Bringing all terms to left side: x² + 6.7e-4 x - 6.7e-5 = 0. That's a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=6.7e-4, c= -6.7e-5.

Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Let's compute the discriminant first. b² is (6.7e-4)^2 = approx 4.489e-7. 4ac is 4*1*(-6.7e-5) = -2.68e-4. So the discriminant is 4.489e-7 + 2.68e-4. Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, the discriminant is b² - 4ac. Since c is negative, -4ac becomes positive. So discriminant D= (6.7e-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-6.7e-5) = 4.489e-7 + 4*6.7e-5. 4*6.7e-5 is 2.68e-4, which is 2.68e-4. So 4.489e-7 + 2.68e-4 is 2.684489e-4 approx. So sqrt(D) is sqrt(2.684489e-4). Let me compute that. The square root of 2.684489e-4 is about 0.0164, because (0.0164)^2 = approx 0.00026896, which matches D=2.684e-4.

So x = [-6.7e-4 ± 0.0164]/2. Let's compute both possibilities. The first solution is (-6.7e-4 + 0.0164)/2. Let's compute 0.0164 - 0.00067 is about 0.01573. Divided by 2: 0.01573 / 2 is about 0.007865 M. The second solution would be (-6.7e-4 - 0.0164)/2, which is negative, so we ignore that because concentrations can't be negative.

So x is approximately 0.007865 M. So [H+] is about 0.007865 M, so [H3O+] is about 7.865e-3 M. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 0.007865 M. Let's see: Option A has 6.7e-3, which is close but not exactly the same. Option H is [H3O+] =8.1e-5, which is lower. Option J is 7.7e-3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me compute the quadratic again. The equation is x² + 6.7e-4 x -6.7e-5 =0. So a=1, b=6.7e-4, c=-6.7e-5.

Discriminant D is (6.7e-4)^2 -4*1*(-6.7e-5) = (4.489e-7) + (2.68e-4) = 0.000272489.

Wait, yeah, that's 2.684e-4. The square root is about 0.01639 (since 0.01639^2 is 2.724e-4). So x = [ -6.7e-4 ± 0.01639 ] / 2.

Let me compute both possibilities.

First possibility: (-6.7e-4 + 0.01639) / 2 = (0.01572) / 2 = 0.00786 M.

Second: negative, so ignore.

So [H3O+] is approximately 7.86e-3 M, which is 0.00786 M. Looking at the options, option J has [H3O+] =7.7e-3, which is close. But wait, the options don't have exactly that. Let me look again.

Wait, let's think about the exact calculation. Maybe I should compute more accurately. Let me compute x² + 6.7e-4 x = 6.7e-5.

So x² + (6.7e-4)x -6.7e-5 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -6.7e-4 ± sqrt( (6.7e-4)^2 +4*6.7e-5 ) ] / 2.

Compute inside the sqrt: (6.7e-4)^2 = 4.489e-7.

4*6.7e-5 = 0.000268.

So sqrt(4.489e-7 + 0.000268) = sqrt(0.000272489) ≈ 0.0165 M.

So x = [ -6.7e-4 + 0.0165 ] / 2.

Compute numerator: 0.0165 -0.00067 = 0.01583.

Divide by 2: 0.007915 M.

So [H3O+] is approximately 0.007915 M, which is about 0.0079 M. None of the options exactly match this, but let me look at the options again.

Let me check option J: [H3O+] is 7.7e-3 M, which is 0.0077 M. That's close to our calculated 0.0079 M. But perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial quadratic setup. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation for weak acids where x is much smaller than the initial concentration.

Wait, the initial concentration is 0.10 M. The Ka is 6.7e-4. So the approximation is x << 0.10. Let me check: 1.0e-4 is 0.0001, so 6.7e-4 is about 6.7% of 0.10, which is not very small. So the approximation x << 0.10 won't hold. Therefore, I can't ignore the x term in the denominator, so I must use the exact quadratic solution, which gives x ≈ 0.0079 M. So the [H3O+] is about 0.0079 M.

Looking back at the options, let's see which option's [H3O+] is close to 0.0079 M.

Option J: 7.7e-3 M is 0.0077 M. That's 0.0002 M less than our calculation. Option A: 6.7e-3 is 0.0067. Option I is 7.7e-4, which is even lower. Option H is 8.1e-5, which is way too low.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think: HF is a weak acid, so [H+] is sqrt(Ka * C), but wait, for weak acids, the exact calculation gives [H+] = sqrt( Ka * C ), but only when x is negligible compared to 0.10. Wait, but in this case, let me check if the approximation holds. Let's compute x as 0.0079 M. 0.0079 is 7.9e-3, which is 7.9% of 0.10. Hmm, that's not that small. So it's better to use the exact solution.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Another approach is to consider that when the concentration is not very high, sometimes we can approximate, but in this case, the concentration is 0.10 M and Ka is 6.7e-4. The expression for x is (6.7e-4 * 0.10)/(1 + 6.7e-4 /0.10 ), but that's the approximation. Wait, that would be x ≈ sqrt(Ka * C) = sqrt(6.7e-4 *0.10) = sqrt(6.7e-5) ≈ 0.008187 M, which is about 8.19e-3 M. Wait, but that's higher than our previous calculation. That's confusing. So why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, because the approximation is only valid when x is much less than 0.10. Here, x is 0.0079 M, which is about 7.9% of 0.10. So the approximation isn't great. Therefore, the exact solution is more accurate. So according to the exact calculation, [H3O+] is approximately 0.0079 M, which is 7.9e-3 M. Looking at the options, option J has 7.7e-3 M, which is close. But wait, another way to calculate is perhaps to compute the exact value.

Wait, let me try plugging x into the equation again. Let me compute x = [0.007915], then [H+] is about 0.0079 M. So [OH-] would be Kw / [H+] = 1e-14 / 7.9e-3 = approximately 1.266e-12 M.

Looking at the options, let's check which option has [OH^-] close to 1.266e-12.

Wait, looking at the options, option J has [OH^-] = 1.3e-12, which is very close. So [H+] is approximately 7.9e-3, which would match option J's [H3O+] of 7.7e-3. But wait, that's a discrepancy in [H3O+] between the exact calculation and the option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact solution. Alternatively, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me recompute x.

The equation is x² + 6.7e-4 x - 6.7e-5 =0.

a=1, b=6.7e-4 (approx 6.7e-4), c= -6.7e-5.

Discriminant D = (6.7e-4)^2 + 4*(6.7e-5) = (4.489e-7) + 0.000268 = 0.000272489.

sqrt(D) = approx 0.0165.

So x = [-6.7e-4 + 0.0165 ] / 2 = (0.01583)/2 = 0.007915 M. So [H+] is 0.007915 M, which is 7.915e-3 M.

Looking at the options, option J's [H3O+] is 7.7e-3, which is a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using more precise sqrt(0.000272489). Let me compute it more accurately.

What's sqrt(0.000272489)?

Well, 0.000272489 = 2.72489e-4.

Compute sqrt(2.72489e-4): let's find the exact value.

We can write 2.72489e-4 as 272.489e-6.

So sqrt(272.489e-6) = sqrt(272.489) * 1e-3.

What's sqrt(272.489)?

Well, 16^2 is 256, 17^2 is 289. 16.5^2 is 272.25. Because 16.5 *16.5= 272.25. So sqrt(272.489)= approx 16.508.

So sqrt(2.72489e-4) ≈ 16.508e-3 = 0.016508 M.

So x = ( -6.7e-4 + 0.016508 ) / 2 = (0.016508 - 0.00067) /2 = (0.015838)/2 = 0.007919 M.

So approximately 0.007919 M, which is 7.919e-3 M.

So [H3O+] is about7.92e-3 M.

Looking at the options, none have exactly this value. The closest is option J, which is [H3O+] =7.7e-3 (0.0077), which is 0.00002 less. But perhaps the options are rounded.

Another approach: perhaps the problem assumes that the approximation holds, even though the x isn't negligible. Let me check.

If we use the approximation x ≈ sqrt(Ka * C), then x ≈ sqrt(6.7e-4 *0.10) = sqrt(6.7e-5) ≈ 0.008187 M (8.187e-3 M).

But in reality, the exact solution gives x≈7.92e-3 M, which is a little lower than 8.19e-3. Hmm, so the approximation is a bit off, but close.

Which option has [H3O+] around 8e-3? Let's see. Option H is [H3O+] =8.1e-5 M, which is way too low. Option I is 7.7e-4. Hmm, none of the options have [H3O+] around 8e-3 M.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option H is [H3O+] =8.1e-5, which is 0.00081 M. That's way too low. Option G's [H3O+] is 8.2e-4 (0.00082), which is also lower. Wait, none of the options have [H3O+] close to 0.008 M. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again about the reaction. HF dissociates into H+ and F-: so each molecule gives one H+ and one F-.

The correct setup for the ICE table is:

Initial: [HF] =0.10, [H+] =0, [F-] =0.

Change: [HF] = -x, [H+] = +x, [F-] = +x.

Equilibrium: [HF] =0.10 -x, [H+] =x, [F-]=x.

Ka = (x)(x) / (0.10 -x) = x²/(0.10 -x) =6.7e-4.

So equation: x² =6.7e-4 (0.10 -x) → x² +6.7e-4 x -6.7e-5 =0.

Which is the same equation I set up earlier. So back to the same calculation.

So [H3O+] is approximately 0.0079 M.

Looking for the option closest to 0.0079 M. Let me check the options again.

Option H: [H3O+] =8.1e-5 M (0.000081 M).

Option I: 7.7e-4 M (0.00077 M).

Wait, I think there's a mistake here because I'm getting 0.0079 M, which is 7.9e-3. None of the options have exactly that. The closest is option J, which is 7.7e-3. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is more precise, leading to a [H3O+] of about 0.0079 M, but the options have [H3O+] as 7.7e-3. But why is the option J's [H3O+] 7.7e-3 while the calculation gives 7.9e-3?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me re-express the equation.

x² +6.7e-4 x -6.7e-5 =0.

The quadratic equation is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Wait, no. The discriminant is b² -4ac. So, in our case, a=1, b=6.7e-4, c=-6.7e-5.

So discriminant D = (6.7e-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-6.7e-5)= 4.489e-7 + 2.68e-4= approx 2.72489e-4.

So sqrt(D)= approx 0.0165 M.

So x = [ -6.7e-4 +0.0165 ] / 2 = (0.01583)/2= 0.007915 M.

So [H3O+]=0.007915 M.

In the options, option J's [H3O+] is 7.7e-3 M, which is 0.0077 M. That's 0.00004 M less than the exact calculation. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the approximation, and the options are rounded.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, another possibility is that the problem is asking for the [OH^-], and the user in the problem statement is asking for the [OH^-], which is the same as Kw / [H3O+].

Wait, let me compute [OH^-] using the exact [H3O+] of 0.007915 M.

So [OH^-] = 1e-14 / 0.007915 ≈ 1.263e-12 M.

Looking for which option has [OH^-] around 1.26e-12 M.

Looking at the options:

Option J: [OH^-] =1.3e-12 M. Close.

Option I: [OH^-] =1e-14 /7.7e-4 = approx 1.299e-11 M, which is 1.3e-11 M.

Option H: [OH^-] =1e-14/(8.1e-5)= approx 1.2345e-10 M.

So the closest is option J: 1.3e-12 M.

Therefore, the correct option is J, but the exact [H3O+] is around 7.9e-3 M, which is 7.9 mM, but the options have J as 7.7 mM.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option J, which has [H3O+] =7.7e-3 M, and [OH^-] =1.3e-12 M.

Wait, another way to think: perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution is approximately 0.008 M, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is [H3O+] =0.007915 M, which is 7.915e-3 M, which is 7.915 mM.

Looking at the options, option J has [H3O+] =7.7e-3 M, which is 7.7 mM. It's a bit lower, but the options don't have the exact value. So perhaps the intended answer is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the exact calculation but the options are rounded. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact solution.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact approach to compute [H3O+] and [OH^-].

Let me compute x from the equation x² +6.7e-4 x -6.7e-5 =0.

Using the exact quadratic formula:

x = [ -6.7e-4 + sqrt( (6.7e-4)^2 +4*6.7e-5 ) ] / 2.

Compute inside the sqrt: (6.7e-4)^2 = 4.489e-7, 4 *6.7e-5=0.000268.

So sqrt(4.489e-7 + 0.000268) = sqrt(0.000272489).

Which is approximately 0.016508 M.

So x = [ -6.7e-4 + 0.016508 ] / 2 = (0.015838)/2 =0.007919 M.

So [H3O+] is approximately 0.007919 M, which is 7.919e-3 M, which is 7.92 mM.

Looking for the closest option, option J is 7.7e-3 M, which is 7.7 mM. So option J is 0.0077 M, which is 7.7 mM.

But wait, perhaps the problem uses the approximation, so the [H3O+] is approximately 0.008 M, which is 8 mM, but none of the options have this. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact solution and the closest option is option J.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps use the exact calculation to find [H3O+] and [OH^-], and see which option matches.

So [H3O+] is 0.007919 M, which is 7.919 mM.

[OH^-] is Kw / [H3O+] = 1e-14 / 7.919e-3 = approx 1.262e-12 M.

Looking for which option has [OH^-] =1.26e-12 M. Option J has [OH^-] =1.3e-12 M, which is very close.

So the correct option is J, with [H3O+] =7.7e-3 M and [OH^-] =1.3e-12 M.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's options are incorrect, but I have to select the best option based on my calculations.

So the conclusion is that the correct answer is option J.

To determine the concentrations of [H₃O⁺] and [OH⁻] in a 0.10 M HF solution, we use the following steps:

1. **Write the dissociation equation**:  
   HF ⇌ H⁺ + F⁻.

2. **Set up the equilibrium expression (Ka)**:  
   Ka = [H⁺][F⁻] / [HF] = 6.7 × 10⁻⁴.

3. **Define variables**:  
   Let [H⁺] = x. Then, [F⁻] = x, and [HF] = 0.10 - x.

4. **Substitute into Ka equation**:  
   x² / (0.10 - x) = 6.7 × 10⁻⁴.

5. **Rearrange the equation**:  
   x² + 6.7 × 10⁻⁴ x - 6.7 × 10⁻⁵ = 0.

6. **Solve using the quadratic formula**:  
   x = [ -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a),  
   where a = 1, b = 6.7 × 10⁻⁴, c = -6.7 × 10⁻⁵.

7. **Calculate the discriminant**:  
   D = (6.7 × 10⁻⁴)² - 4(1)(-6.7 × 10⁻⁵)  
   = 4.489 × 10⁻⁷ + 2.68 × 10⁻⁵  
   = 0.000272489.

8. **Find the square root of the discriminant**:  
   √D ≈ 0.016508 M.

9. **Calculate [H⁺]**:  
   x = [ -6.7 × 10⁻⁴ + 0.016508 ] / 2  
   = (0.015838) / 2  
   = 0.007919 M.

10. **Compare with the options**:  
    - [H₃O⁺] = 0.007919 M ≈ 7.92 mM.  
    - [OH⁻] = Kw / [H₃O⁺] = 1.262 × 10⁻¹² M.

11. **Match with the options**:

ANSWER: J
