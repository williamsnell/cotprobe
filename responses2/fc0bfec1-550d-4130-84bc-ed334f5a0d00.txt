Okay, so I need to figure out this math problem. Let me read it again.

Ken and Tami are making necklaces. Ken makes 25 necklaces. Tami makes m more than Ken. I need to find the expression that represents the total number of necklaces they made together.

Hmm, let's break it down. Ken makes 25 necklaces. Tami makes m more than that. So Tami's number of necklaces would be 25 plus m, right? Because adding m more to Ken's 25.

So Tami = 25 + m.

Now, the total number of necklaces they made together would be the sum of Ken's and Tami's. So that's 25 (from Ken) plus (25 + m) (from Tami). Let me write that out: 25 + (25 + m).

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Are they asking for something else? The question says, "Which expression represents the total number of necklaces Ken and Tami made?" So yes, total is 25 + (25 + m).

Looking at the options, option A is 25 + (25 + m). So that's the expression I came up with.

Let me check the other options to make sure A is correct.

Option B: 25 + m. That's just Tami's necklaces, not the total. So no.

Option C: m +25m. That's 26m, which doesn't make sense unless m is something else, but the problem says Tami makes m more, so I think m is a number, not a variable.

Option D: 25m +25. That would be if Ken made m necklaces and Tami made 25, but that's not the case. Ken made 25, Tami made 25 + m.

Option E: 25 + 25m. That would be if Ken made m necklaces and Tami made 25, but again, that's not how the problem is set up.

Option F: 25m. That's just Ken making m necklaces, which is incorrect.

Option G: 25m - m. That would be 24m, which isn't applicable here.

Option H: 2(25 + m). That's 50 + 2m, which is not what we need. We need 25 + 25 + m, which is 50 + m, not 50 + 2m.

Option I: 50 + m. That's the same as H, which is incorrect.

Option J: m -25. That's negative, which doesn't make sense in this context.

So the only correct option is A: 25 + (25 + m). I think that's the right answer.

The correct expression is A: 25 + (25 + m).
