Okay, so I've got this question about the nonprofit sector and the proportion of practitioners who conduct audience research. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nonprofit management, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that nonprofit organizations have different types of management, like service-based or for profit. Service-based nonprofits might focus more on volunteer work and might not have the same structure as for profit ones. But I'm not sure how that affects audience research.

Audience research is a common practice in many sectors. For for profit nonprofits, they might do this more often than not, especially for events or campaigns they're involved in. But I'm not certain if that's the case for service-based ones.

Wait, in some places, nonprofit organizations do have a significant role in audience research. I think they might be more involved in community engagement and social impact. So maybe they do a lot of audience research, but is that a lot or a small proportion?

I recall there's a term called "volunteerism" in nonprofit management. They might use their own volunteer hours to do research, but I'm not sure how much that contributes to the total number of practitioners conducting research. Also, not all nonprofits might have the resources to do extensive research. Some might focus more on other activities.

Looking at the options: A is one-half, which seems a bit high. B is less than 10%, which feels too low. C is nearly all, which might not be right. D is more than 80%, which is a high number. E is approximately 90%, which is even higher than D. F is three quarters, close to E. G is one-quarter, which is 25%, and H is one third (about 33.3%), I is two thirds (66.6%), and J isn't an option here, so I think the options are A to I.

Wait, I'm trying to think if there's any data or studies that suggest this. From what I remember, in the nonprofit sector, a significant portion does engage in audience research, but perhaps it's a large proportion. Maybe around 50% or more? Or perhaps it's more than half?

Wait, I think I've read somewhere that in some sectors, like education or social work, 50% or more might be the case. But for service-based nonprofits, maybe it's higher? Or perhaps it's lower. Hmm.

Another angle: sometimes, the nonprofit sector is known for being more of a service-oriented one, where the focus is on providing services rather than conducting research. But I'm not sure if that's a limitation or a strength.

Wait, another thought: maybe the majority of nonprofits conduct research, but not all. So the answer might be H (one third) or I (two thirds). Or perhaps more than 80% (D) or 90% (E). But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I've read that around 50% of nonprofits actually conduct some form of audience research, but it's not a common practice. So that would point to a proportion between 50% and 80%. So looking at the options, the closest would be option D (more than 80%) or E (90%). Or maybe H (one third) or I (two thirds). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the majority (over 80%) do conduct audience research. So the answer would be D, more than 80%. But I'm not entirely certain. I think I've heard that in some cases, more than half do, but perhaps more than 80% is a solid choice.

The correct answer is D: More than 80%.
