Okay, so I need to figure out the average life expectancy of white males born in the U.S. just before the Civil War. Hmm, I remember that the Civil War was a major event in the early 19th century, and it had a big impact on health statistics. 

I think the average life expectancy for white males was higher back then. Wait, I'm trying to recall. From what I remember, in the 1800s, the average life expectancy for white males was around 70 years. That sounds familiar because I've heard that life expectancy improved a lot during the Industrial Revolution, which came after the Civil War.

Oh wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Before the Civil War, the highest life expectancy among white males I can think of is around 70 or 80. I think it was higher than the overall average. Also, I remember hearing that after the Civil War, there was a significant decrease in life expectancy, which was part of the reason for the Civil Rights Movement's fight against desegregation.

So looking at the options, D is 70 and G is 40. Oh wait, no, 40 is lower than 30, which I think was the average before. But the options also have 80, which is H. So I'm a bit torn between D and H.

Wait, let me think about when the Civil War happened. The Civil War started in 1861, I believe. So the data would be from around 1860s. Before that, the average life expectancy for white males was higher. I think it was around 70 or 80. So option D or H. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: I think the 1860s was a time when the U.S. government was trying to improve public health, so life expectancy went up. Maybe 70 was the average. But some sources I've seen before indicated that during the 19th century, white male life expectancies were around 80, but that's not correct because the average was higher. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. I think the average life expectancy for white males was 70 before the Civil War. So option D would be 70, but option H is 80. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the average was around 70, making D the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes the numbers can vary.

Wait, I'm probably getting this mixed up. Let me think about the data. In the 1800s, life expectancy was higher for white males, like 75 or 80. During the Civil War, the government did focus on public health, leading to improvements. So the life expectancy for white males was higher than the overall average, but I'm not sure if it's 70 or 80. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the U.S. numbers with other countries. But this is about the U.S., so I think the average was around 70. So option D, which is 70 years, would be the correct answer.
