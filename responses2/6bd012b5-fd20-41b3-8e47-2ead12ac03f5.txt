Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car battery and a current. Let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question says the car battery supplies a current I of 50 amps to the starter motor. They're asking how much charge passes through the starter in half a minute. The options are A to J, with varying coulomb values.

Wait, I remember that current is related to charge. Oh right, the formula is I = Q/t. So charge Q equals current I multiplied by time t. That makes sense because current is the rate of charge flow.

First, I need to find the time in seconds because the current is given in amps, which is coulombs per second. Half a minute is 30 seconds. Oh wait, no, half a minute is 30 seconds? Wait, wait. No, wait. One minute is 60 seconds, so half a minute is 30 seconds. Yes, that's correct.

So I is 50 amps, time t is 30 seconds. So Q = I * t. Plugging in, 50 A * 30 s = 1500 coulombs. Let me check the options. Option D is 1500 coulombs. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes, I get confused with units. Oh, wait, yes, in coulombs, the unit is correct. Amps are coulombs per second. So 50 A is 50 coulombs per second. Multiply by 30 seconds gives 1500 coul. That's right.

Other options: Let's see. Option C is 3000, which would be 50 A * 60 s, which is a minute. Option E is 2500, but that's 50 A * 50 s. Wait, 50*50 is 2500, right? Oh wait, noâ€”if I made a mistake in the time; oh wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, half a minute is 30 seconds, not 50. So 50*30 is 1500. So option D is correct.

Wait another option, option G is 1200, which would be 50*24? Wait, 50*24 is 1200, which is 24 seconds. But 24 isn't half a minute. So no. Option J is 600, which is 50*12, which is 12 seconds. So that's not right either.

So yeah, I think D is the right answer. So I pick D.

To determine the amount of charge that passes through the starter in half a minute, we use the relationship between current (I), charge (Q), and time (t): 

\[
Q = I \times t
\]

The current \( I \) is given as 50 A (amperes), and the time \( t \) is half a minute, which converts to 30 seconds. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[
Q = 50 \, \text{A} \times 30 \, \text{s} = 1500 \, \text{C}
\]

Thus, the charge that passes through the starter in half a minute is **1500 coulombs**. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**D: 1500 coul**
