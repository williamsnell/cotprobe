Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of simple harmonic motion. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that one end of a fingernail file is clamped in a vise, and the other end is given a to-and-fro vibration. The motion is approximately simple harmonic motion (S.H.M.), which I remember is a back and forth motion where the acceleration is proportional to the displacement, but in the opposite direction. So, the formula I remember for velocity in S.H.M. is something like v = ω√(A² - x²), where ω is the angular frequency, A is the amplitude, and x is the displacement.

Wait, but wait a second. There's another approach I remember. Oh right, the velocity at any displacement x can also be expressed as v = x * ω * √(1 - (x²/A²)). Or maybe that's not quite right. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, I think the correct formula is v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²). Yeah, that sounds right. Because when x is zero, velocity is maximum, which makes sense.

So the problem gives me the frequency of the motion, which is 10 vibrations per second. Frequency f is related to angular frequency ω by the formula ω = 2πf. So plugging in f=10, ω will be 2π*10 = 20π radians per second. Let me write that down: ω = 20π rad/s.

The amplitude A is given as 4 mm. So 4 mm. But our displacement x is 2 mm. I need to calculate the velocity when x is 2 mm.

Plugging into the formula: v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²). Let me compute each part.

First, compute A². A is 4 mm, so A² is 16 mm². x is 2 mm, so x² is 4 mm². Subtracting, A² - x² is 16 -4 =12 mm². So sqrt(12) is sqrt(4*3) = 2*sqrt(3) ≈ 3.464 mm.

Then multiply by ω, which is 20π. So v = 20π * 3.464 mm/s. Let me compute that. 20 * 3.464 is 69.28, and multiplied by π (approximately 3.1416) gives about 69.28 * 3.1416 ≈ let me compute that.

Hmm, 70 times 3.14 is about 219.8. But since it's 69.28, it's a bit less. Let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, 69.28 * 3.1416 = let's do 69 *3.1416 first.

69 * 3 = 207, 69 * 0.1416 = approx 9.8304. So total is 207 +9.8304≈216.8304. But wait, the 0.28 part is 0.28 *3.1416≈0.8796. So adding that: 216.8304 + 0.8796=217.71 mm/s.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 217. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate:

v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²) = 20π * sqrt(16 -4) = 20π * sqrt(12) = 20π * 2*sqrt(3) = 40π sqrt(3) mm/s.

Wait, that's much better. Because sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). So:

v = 20π * 2√3 = 40π √3 mm/s.

Now, I can compute this exact value. Let's calculate the numerical value.

π is approximately 3.1416. √3 is about 1.732.

So 40 * 3.1416 = 125.664. Now multiply by 1.732: 125.664 * 1.732.

Let me compute that. 125 * 1.732 is 216.5, and 0.664 * 1.732 is about 1.153. So total is approximately 217.65 mm/s. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have a 217. So which option is closest? Let's look at the options.

The options are A:190, B:260, C:200, D:230, E:180, F:210, G:220, H:250, I:240, J:218.

My calculation gives about 217.65 mm/s. So the closest option is J:218 mm/s. But wait, I thought my initial calculation was about 217.65, which is near 218.

Wait, but wait a moment. Did I mix up the formula?

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier with the formula. Let me double-check.

The correct formula for the velocity in S.H.M. is v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²). So that part is correct. Alternatively, another way to write it is v = x * ω * sqrt(1 - (x²/A²)). Let's see, x is 2 mm, A is 4 mm. So x/A is 0.5. So 1 - (0.5)^2= 0.75. So sqrt(0.75)=0.866. So v = 2 mm * 20π rad/s * 0.866.

2 times 20 is 40, times 0.866 is 34.64. So 34.64 mm/s. Wait, that's way off. Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation was 217. So which is correct?

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me get the formula right.

Alternative approach: The maximum velocity (when x=0) is ωA. So ωA = 20π *4=80π≈251.327 mm/s.

At x=2 mm, the velocity v would be less than max. So the velocity is v = ω * sqrt(A² - x²) = 20π * sqrt(16 -4) =20π * sqrt(12)=20π*(2*sqrt(3))=40π sqrt(3) ≈40 * 3.1416 * 1.732≈40 *5.441≈217.65 mm/s, as before.

So that's about 217.65, which is near option J (218 mm/s). But wait, another approach. Let's calculate using x/A = 2/4 =0.5. So sin(theta)=0.5, so theta=30 degrees. So in a right triangle, sin(theta)=x/A, cos(theta)=sqrt(1 -x²/A²)=sqrt(0.75)=0.866.

Velocity is ωA sin(theta). So v=ωA sin(theta). Since x= A sin(theta), so sin(theta)=x/A.

So v= ω A (x/A) )= ω x. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because when you have v = ω A sin(theta), and x = A sin(theta), so v = ω x.

Wait, that would be v=ω x. So when x=2 mm, v=20π * 2 mm =40π mm/s. Which is approximately 125.66 mm/s. That's conflicting with the earlier results.

But that can't be correct because when x=0, v should be maximum (ωA), which is about 251.327 mm/s. But according to this, when x=0, v=0, which is wrong. So that approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another approach: In SHM, the velocity as a function of displacement is v = ω√(A² -x²).

So when x=0, v=ωA, correct. When x=A, velocity is zero. So using the formula, when x=2, sqrt(16-4)=sqrt(12)=3.464, so v=20π *3.464. Which is about 217.65 mm/s.

So, the correct answer is approximately 217.65 mm/s, which is closest to option J (218 mm/s).

But wait, I'm a bit confused because some sources say that the velocity is given by v = x * ω * sqrt(1 - (x/A)^2). Let me check that.

Wait, x = A sin(theta), so v = dx/dt = A ω cos(theta) * d(theta)/dt. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this. Alternatively, another formula I've seen is v = ω sqrt(A² -x²). Yes, that's the correct one. So that's my initial approach.

But wait, in the alternative approach, I thought v = ω x, which is wrong because when x=0, v would be zero. So that approach was incorrect.

So going back, the correct formula is v = ω sqrt(A² - x²). So when x is 2 mm, it's v=20π * sqrt(12)≈217.65 mm/s, which is about 218 mm/s. So the correct option is J.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the free end of the fingernail file undergoing simple harmonic motion (S.H.M.). The motion is described by the formula for velocity in S.H.M.:

\[
v = \omega \sqrt{A^2 - x^2}
\]

where:
- \( \omega \) is the angular frequency,
- \( A \) is the amplitude,
- \( x \) is the displacement.

### Step 1: Calculate the angular frequency (\( \omega \))
The frequency of the motion is given as \( f = 10 \, \text{Hz} \). The angular frequency is related to the frequency by:

\[
\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi (10) = 20\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute the known values
The amplitude \( A = 4 \, \text{mm} \) and the displacement \( x = 2 \, \text{mm} \). Substitute these into the velocity formula:

\[
v = 20\pi \sqrt{(4)^2 - (2)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
A^2 - x^2 = 16 - 4 = 12 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

Thus:

\[
v = 20\pi \sqrt{12}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the expression
\[
\sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3} \approx 3.464
\]

So:

\[
v = 20\pi \cdot 3.464
\]

Multiply:

\[
v \approx 20 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 3.464 \approx 217.65 \, \text{mm/s}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The calculated velocity is approximately \( 217.65 \, \text{mm/s} \). The closest option is **J: 218 mm/s**.

### Final Answer:
ANSWER: J
