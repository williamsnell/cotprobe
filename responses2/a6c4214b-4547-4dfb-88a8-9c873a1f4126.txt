Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question about the primary purpose of a "__________". The question is asking for the term that helps in obtaining detailed information about job requirements to facilitate decisions related to compensation. Let me break this down.

First, I'll look at the options provided. The options are A through J, each with a different term. I'll need to recall what each of these terms means in the context of job-related processes.

Option A: Performance review. That's about evaluating an employee's performance. I don't think this is about job requirements or compensation.

Option B: Job analysis. This comes to mind because job analysis involves breaking down the job into its components, identifying tasks, responsibilities, and expectations. It's about understanding what the job entails for the person doing it. So this might help in setting clear job requirements, which is what the question is about.

Option C: Job description. A job description usually provides the job title, location, and scope of work. It's more about the job itself than the requirements for compensation.

Option D: Organizational analysis. This is broader, looking at the entire organization's structure and operations. It might provide insights into how the company is structured but not necessarily the specific job requirements for compensation.

Option E: Workforce analysis. Similar to organizational analysis, this is about understanding the workforce but not directly about job requirements for compensation.

Option F: Employee orientation. This is about preparing employees for their new role, which is more about how they'll be treated rather than the job itself.

Option G: Recruitment process. This is about how to get people into the job, which is more about the pipeline for the company rather than the job's requirements.

Option H: Job evaluation. This term can be a bit tricky. I know it has multiple meanings, but in the context of compensation, it refers to assessing job performance to determine compensation tiers. So this could be the term we're looking for.

Option I: Employee survey. This is about gathering feedback on employee needs, which affects compensation but isn't the primary purpose of the survey itself.

Option J: Needs assessment. This is a general term but could relate to job requirements, depending on the context.

Now, the question specifically asks about obtaining detailed information about job requirements. Job analysis (B) seems to fit because it provides the necessary details about the job, which would then be used to set compensation. Job evaluation (H) is similar, as it assesses job performance for compensation tiers. However, the question is about the primary purpose, so job analysis might be more about understanding the job structure, while job evaluation is about performance assessment.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each term is meant to do. Job analysis is about understanding the job, job scope, responsibilities, etc., which would be part of setting up the job description. Job evaluation, on the other hand, is more about the performance and thus the compensation.

So the question is about obtaining detailed information about job requirements, which is likely the job description, but the term "job analysis" is broader and more about the job's components, which would set up the job description. However, the question asks for obtaining the information, so maybe job analysis is the term because it's about understanding the job's requirements, which are then used for compensation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about the primary purpose. Job analysis might be more about understanding the job itself, while job evaluation is about performance. But the options don't have a term that specifically refers to job analysis as a method to get job requirements. The options are general terms.

Looking back, the options are:

A: performance review
B: job analysis
C: job description
D: organizational analysis
E: workforce analysis
F: employee orientation
G: recruitment process
H: job evaluation
I: employee survey
J: needs assessment

So, the question is about obtaining detailed information about job requirements for compensation. Job analysis is about understanding the job's components, which would help in setting up the job description. But the term "job description" is option C.

Wait, but the question is about job requirements specifically. Job analysis is a method used to create the job description, but it's not a direct term for getting the requirements. Job evaluation is about performance, which is a part of compensation. So perhaps the intended answer is job evaluation (H), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, job analysis might be a term that serves that purpose. But I think more accurately, the term is job evaluation. Let me check some notes.

Upon recalling, job evaluation is the process to determine compensation levels, so it's the primary purpose.

The primary purpose of a job evaluation is to determine compensation based on performance. 

Answer: H: job evaluation
