Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about Cicero's teachings. I'm not super familiar with all the legal or moral principles, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks what Cicero claims is sometimes permissible to do. The options are A to J, each with a different action. I remember that Cicero, especially in his books, talked a lot about ethics and the law.

Looking at the options:
A: commit acts of injustice. Hmm, that sounds like something Cicero might say is wrong. I think he would probably avoid doing that unless it's necessary, but maybe not always.
B: none of the above. That's an option, but I need to check other choices first.
C: harm others for personal gain. Wait, that sounds like the opposite of what he might say. He probably believes harm for personal gain is unethical, so this might not be permissible.
D: act against societal norms. That's a broad statement. I'm not sure if Cicero would consider that. He might have specific examples, but I'm not certain.
E: disobey laws. That's a common thing, but does Cicero think it's permissible? I think he might say breaking the law is wrong unless it's necessary, like in criminal cases. So maybe E is permissible in some cases.
F: steal. Stealing is generally a crime, so Cicero would probably say it's against the law and not permissible.
G: break one’s promises. That sounds like breaking a contract or trust. I'm not sure if that's something he'd consider permissible but I think he might argue against it as unethical.
H: betray one's friends. That's also a strong statement. Betraying friends could be considered a form of betrayal, which Cicero might see as a wrong action.
I: lie. Lying is often seen as a crime, but Cicero might say lies are permissible in certain situations, like when the truth would cause harm.
J: act out of selfishness. That's a broad term, and Cicero might not consider that an ethical category. He's more about specific actions.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember if Cicero allowed lying. I think he did believe that lies can be taught or used for good, but he might not accept them for personal gain. So acting out of selfishness (J) might not be permissible.

Looking back, the options that are permissible according to Cicero would be those that he doesn't outright condemn. So E (disobeying laws) is permissible because sometimes it's necessary, like in criminal cases. But wait, does he consider breaking laws as permissible? I think he would say it's only permissible if it's necessary, like in cases of murder or for criminal purposes. So E might not always be permissible unless it's a criminal offense.

Wait, the question is about what's sometimes permissible. So let's think about each option:

A: In some cases, Cicero might not allow injustice. So it's permissible in certain situations.
B: If all the other options are not, then this is the answer.
C: He probably doesn't consider harming others for personal gain.
D: Maybe he does, as in acting against societal norms, but I'm not sure.
E: He sees it as wrong unless necessary, so permissible in some cases.
F: Stealing is definitely not permissible.
G: Trust-breaking is a crime, so not permissible.
H: Betraying friends is a strong statement, so perhaps not permissible unless in specific cases.
I: Lies are permissible, but in some cases, but maybe not for personal gain.
J: Acts of selfishness as in being self-centered could be considered, but I'm not sure if he would permit that. He might not, since that's more about personal gain.

Wait, the question is asking which is sometimes permissible. Let's see:

So, what are Cicero's views? I remember that Cicero often talked about the law as a means to guide actions. He believed that without laws, people act in ways that are not in line with their hearts or the law. So, he would probably say that it's permissible to follow the law unless it's necessary. So E, disobeying laws, might be permissible in criminal cases.

But wait, does he consider breaking the law in general as permissible? I think he would say that it's only permissible if it's necessary, like in cases of murder, or for criminal purposes. So E is permissible in some cases, but not all. But the question is about what's sometimes permissible, so E is an option.

Wait, but looking at the other options, maybe the correct answer is E. But wait, another thought: option B says "none of the above." But I don't think that's the case. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are A to J. So the question is what Cicero claims is sometimes permissible. So, if I'm considering what he would say, he would say that lying is permissible (I), breaking promises (G) is wrong, etc.

The key is to pick the correct permissible action. I think Cicero allows lies, but not for personal gain. So I is permissible.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think: which of these are permissible according to Cicero's teachings?

Option E: Disobeying laws. If Cicero says that breaking the law is only permissible in criminal cases, then E is sometimes permissible. So that's one possibility.

Option J: acting out of selfishness. I'm not sure. Maybe not allowed.

Option I: lying. Maybe he allows lies but not for personal gain.

So, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, lying, but I'm not sure. Wait, I thought he allowed lies in some cases, like in criminal scenarios, but not for personal gain.

Wait, another approach: looking for which actions are permissible according to Cicero's teachings. If the question is which are sometimes permissible, then perhaps E is one.

Wait, the options are: which are sometimes permissible. So for example, lying might be permissible in certain circumstances, but not others.

So, perhaps E is permissible in some cases (criminal law), so it's sometimes permissible. So the answer would be E.

But wait, I'm also considering that option G: break one's promises. That's a form of betrayal, which I think Cicero would consider not permissible.

So the permissible options would be E and maybe I.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps Cicero allows acting in accordance with the law, but not breaking the law in general.

Wait, but the question is, what is sometimes permissible. So which of these actions are permissible. Let's list each option:

A: In some cases, yes. For example, in moral dilemmas where justice is needed.

B: Not sure. I don't think Cicero would allow that as a category.

C: No. He thinks harming others for personal gain is wrong.

D: Hmm, I'm not sure. He might allow acting against societal norms, but I'm not certain.

E: Disobeying laws. If that's permissible, then E is correct.

F: Stealing, definitely not.

G: Trust-breaking, definitely wrong.

H: Betraying friends, probably not permissible.

I: Lies. He might allow lies in certain cases, like in criminal situations but not for personal gain.

J: Acts of selfishness, perhaps not.

So, the permissible actions according to Cicero would be E and I. Wait, but the question is asking which is sometimes permissible. So perhaps E is the correct answer because it's permissible in some cases.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and the correct answer is one of them. So the possible correct answers are E and I.

Wait, but the question is about what is sometimes permissible. So perhaps E is correct. Alternatively, maybe I is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think again: Cicero's teachings. He talked about the law as a tool for guiding behavior. He believed that without laws, people act in ways that don't align with their hearts or societal norms.

So, according to Cicero, lying is permissible, but in some cases, like in the criminal realm, it's only permissible. So, lying is sometimes permissible, not always.

So, among the options, I is permissible. So the answer is I.

Wait, but earlier I thought that breaking the law is only permissible in certain cases. So perhaps, option E is permissible in some cases.

Wait, but the question is about what is sometimes permissible, so E (disobeying laws) is permissible in some situations (like in murder) but not others. So, it's sometimes permissible.

Alternatively, option I (lying) is permissible in certain cases, like in criminal situations, but not for personal gain.

So, the possible correct answers are E and I.

But wait, the initial question is whether it is sometimes permissible. So both E and I could be correct. But the options are single answers.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. The question is, which is sometimes permissible.

If E is permissible in some instances, then the answer is E.

Alternatively, if I is permissible, then I is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each option's likelihood.

A: commit acts of injustice. Cicero might say it's permissible in some cases, so A is sometimes permissible.

B: none of the above. But if any option is correct, then B is not the answer.

C: harm others for personal gain. Probably not.

D: act against societal norms. Maybe he would say it's permissible, but I'm not sure.

E: disobey laws. He would say it's permissible in certain situations.

F: steal. Definitely not.

G: break one’s promises. Betraying friends, probably not.

H: betray one's friends. Betraying friends is a strong statement, likely not permissible.

I: lie. He would say lies are permissible, though in some cases, like in criminal law, they might not be.

J: act out of selfishness. I'm not sure.

So, according to this, E and I could be correct. But the options are single letters.

Wait, but the question is about what is sometimes permissible. So, perhaps E is correct because it's permissible in some cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I, because lying is sometimes permissible.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about Cicero's actual teachings. He is known for being strict about law and rights. He might allow lies in certain contexts but not in others.

So, perhaps the permissible actions include lying, breaking promises (but I'm not sure), and obeying the law in certain cases. But the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because he would say it's permissible in certain situations. Alternatively, I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to pick the most likely correct answer.

The options are A to J, and the question is about what is permissible.

I think the correct answer is E: disobey laws, because Cicero would allow breaking the law in specific instances like murder.

Wait, but earlier I thought that breaking the law is only permissible in criminal cases. So E might not be permissible in all situations, but is permissible in some.

But the question is about sometimes permissible. So E is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I: lie, as he allows lies but not for personal gain.

Wait, but the question is about what's sometimes permissible, so both could be correct. But the options must be one.

Wait, I'm getting too confused. Let me think: which of these is something that Cicero would say is permissible.

I think that lies are permissible but not for personal gain. So I is correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure about E.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, but the initial question is about what is sometimes permissible, so both E and I could be correct but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I.

Wait, another approach: when someone asks what Cicero says is sometimes permissible, the answer would be I: lie. Because he allows lies, but not for personal gain. So, lying is permissible in some cases.

So, the answer would be I.

Wait, but I'm not certain. I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision.

The correct answer is I: lie.
</think>

The correct answer is I: lie. Cicero allows lies in some cases, particularly in situations where they serve a legitimate purpose, but he does not permit lies for personal gain. This aligns with his teachings on the role of lies in social justice.

Answer: I
