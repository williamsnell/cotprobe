Question:

A lumber mill contracted to deliver one thousand8-foot sheets of plywood to a home improvement store on the first of each month for 10 consecutive months starting June 1. The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?

Options:

A: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.
B: Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.
C: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.
D: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.
E: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.
F: Judgment for the mill, because they had informed the store about the issue in advance.

Okay, so I'm looking at this contract law question about a lumber mill and a home improvement store. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: The mill contracted to deliver 1008-foot sheets of plywood monthly starting June 1 for 10 months. The first three months, June, July, and August, were on time and paid for. Then, on August 16, the mill had to cancel the September shipment because of a forest fire in their reserve that destroyed it. The store refused to excuse the mill from further performance, so the store had to deliver the remaining shipments on time, but the September shipment didn't arrive. The store sued the mill for breach of contract, and I need to determine how the court would hold it.

So, what's the issue here? It's a performance contract question. The key issues are whether the performance was discharged, excused, or held responsible for.

The mill performed the first three months on time, and the store agreed. Then, the mill couldn't do the fourth month (September) because of a fire. The store refused to excuse the mill, so it had to hold the mill to the agreed terms.

I think this relates to the concept of performance obligations and whether they're subject to unforeseen circumstances. The question of whether the performance was discharged by impossibility comes to mind. So, the idea is that if the performance was impossible due to unforeseen events, the contract might be discharged.

Looking at the options, option A says the mill would be discharged because it's impossible. Option C says the mill was discharged because the forest fire caused an unforeseen hindrance. Option D talks about frustration of purpose.

Wait, let me remember the law. The main concept here is whether the performance was impossible or whether the performance was excused. The contract law deals with performance obligations that are subject to unforeseen circumstances.

So, in this case, the mill had already delivered the first three quarters on time. The fourth month was September, which was due. The store refused to excuse the mill, so the mill was held responsible. But the mill's performance was canceled because the reserve was destroyed by a forest fire. So, the performance was impossible because the fire happened after the contract had been entered into and the performance was already done.

Or wait, maybe it's about whether the performance was impossible or whether the performance was excused. The mill's performance was impossible because the reserve was destroyed, so the contract might be discharged.

Alternatively, if the performance was impossible, the contract could be discharged, but if the performance was excused, the contract wouldn't be subject to the force of law.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In performance contracts, the key is whether the performance was possible or not. If the performance is impossible, the contract might be discharged. But if the performance is excused, the contract doesn't hold, and the performance is subject to the force of law.

In this case, the store agreed to deliver the fourth month (September) and had to hold the mill to that. But the mill can't perform because of the fire. So, the performance was impossible because of the unforeseen event (fire) that happened after the contract was entered into. Therefore, the mill's performance would be discharged.

So, the correct answer would be A: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.

Wait, but wait another moment. The fact that the fire destroyed the reserveâ€”does that count as an unforeseen event? The contract was entered into before the fire, but the performance was done before the fire. So, the contract might still be subject to the force of law because the performance was impossible due to the event that happened after the contract was entered into.

Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. Let me think about the law.

In some jurisdictions, performance obligations are subject to the force of law if the performance is impossible because the performance was done before an unforeseen event that could have prevented it. For example, if you have a contract to deliver goods, and you deliver them on time but then a unforeseen event happens that makes the performance impossible (like a fire destroying a warehouse), then the contract might still be subject to the force of law.

Wait, no. If your performance is impossible because of an unforeseen event that happened after the performance was done, that doesn't necessarily discharge the contract. The contract's performance is subject to the force of law only if the performance was possible in the first place. So, if you deliver on time, but then an unforeseen event occurs, the contract might still be enforceable because the performance was possible, just impossible.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of performance being impossible because of the event that occurred after the performance was done. So, the contract's performance is subject to the force of law because the performance was possible.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me look for a more precise approach.

The issue is whether the performance was impossible or if it was excused. If the performance was impossible, the contract might be discharged. If it was excused, the contract isn't subject to the force of law.

But in this case, the store refused to excuse the mill. So, the mill had to hold the store to the performance, but the performance was impossible because the reserve was destroyed by a forest fire.

Wait, but the contract was entered into before the fire, but the performance was done before the fire. So, the performance was impossible because of the event that happened after the performance was done. Therefore, the contract might be subject to the force of law because the performance was possible (the contract allowed for performance) but impossible (due to the event).

So, the store's refusal to excuse the mill was a valid excuse. The contract is enforceable because the performance was possible but was impossible due to the event.

So, the mill would not be discharged by impossibility because the performance was possible (they had to deliver the plywood), but it was impossible because of the fire.

Wait, but the question is whether the performance would be discharged by impossibility. That is, the contract would be discharged if the performance was impossible due to unforeseen events.

In this case, the performance was impossible because of the fire, which happened after the performance was delivered. So, the contract might be considered subject to the force of law because the performance was possible.

Thus, the mill is not discharged by impossibility, but rather, it's subject to the force of law because the performance was possible. So, the store would be excused.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Looking back, the options don't have "discharged by impossibility" as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.

B: Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties would not be excused.

C: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseen hindrance.

D: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.

E: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.

F: Judgment for the mill, because they had informed the store about the issue in advance.

So, I think the correct answer is A. Because the performance was impossible due to the event, so the mill would be discharged. But wait, no, because the performance was possible (they had to deliver), just impossible due to the event.

So, the performance was possible, but impossible due to the event. So, the contract would be subject to the force of law, meaning the store would be excused. So, the mill's performance wouldn't be discharged by impossibility.

Wait, but perhaps the question is whether the performance was impossible, which would cause discharge. So, the store had to hold the mill, but the mill's performance was impossible. So, the store's refusal to excuse was not valid, so the mill was subject to the force of law.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let's think about the key elements again.

For performance obligations, the performance is subject to the force of law if it's possible and the performance was possible but impossible due to an unforeseen event. So, in this case, the performance was possible (the mill had to deliver the plywood) but impossible because of the fire.

So, the force of law applies because the performance was possible, but impossible. So, the store was excused.

But the store refused to excuse, so they had to hold the mill to the performance. But in this case, the performance was impossible because of the event. So, the contract would be enforceable because the performance was possible, just impossible.

So, the mill's performance would not be discharged by impossibility because the performance was possible. So, the store was excused.

But the options don't have that. So, looking at the options, the correct answer isn't A because A says the mill's performance would be discharged by impossibility, which is not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. The correct answer might be A because the performance was impossible, so the contract would be discharged by impossibility. But wait, in this case, the performance was possible, but impossible due to the event. So, the contract is in the force of law.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C: The mill was discharged because of the forest fire. That would mean the performance was impossible, which is what happened.

So, the store's refusal to excuse the mill was valid, and the mill was held to the performance, but the performance was impossible due to the fire.

So, the correct answer would be A: The mill would be discharged by impossibility.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's try to think of the situation. The mill was supposed to deliver in June, July, August. The store agreed. Then August 16 told the mill that they couldn't meet September's delivery because the reserve was destroyed by a fire. The mill had to hold the store, so the store sued for breach of contract.

The store refused to excuse, so the mill was held to the performance. But the store's refusal was a valid excuse because the mill could not meet the September delivery.

So, the mill's performance was impossible because the fire happened after the contract was entered into. So, the performance was impossible, which would discharge the contract.

In that case, the correct answer would be A: The mill's performance would be discharged by impossibility.

Wait, but if the performance was impossible, then the contract would be discharged. So, the store had to hold the mill to the performance, but the mill's performance was impossible because of the event, so the store would have to hold it to the performance, but it was impossible. So, the mill would only have to hold the store to the performance that was possible (the delivery of plywood), but the performance was impossible. Therefore, the store would have to hold the mill to the performance, but the performance was already done, so it's a question of whether the performance was possible or not.

Wait, but the contract was entered into before the fire, but the performance was done before. So, the performance was possible, but impossible because of the future event.

So, the contract is enforceable because the performance was possible. But the mill's performance was impossible.

Wait, I'm getting myself stuck again. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose a contract requires you to deliver a widget in January. If you deliver it in December, but the contract was entered into in January. Is that contract enforceable? The law says that performance obligations are subject to the force of law if the performance was possible. So, even if the performance was impossible (because of a future event), the contract is enforceable as long as the performance was possible.

In this case, the performance was possible (they had to deliver in September), but impossible due to the fire. So, the contract is enforceable because the performance was possible, just impossible.

Therefore, the mill was not discharged by impossibility, because they were required to perform, even if it was impossible. So, the store's refusal to excuse was valid, and the mill was held to the performance. But the performance was impossible, so the store had to hold the mill to the performance, but since the performance was already done, the store would have to hold the mill to the performance.

Wait, but the store's refusal to excuse would mean that the mill is discharged.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up again. Let me think about the answer options again.

The correct answer is probably A: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.

Because the performance was impossible due to the event, the mill's performance would be discharged.

But wait, in that case, the mill would be discharged, but the store had to hold the mill to the performance that was possible. So, the store would have to hold the mill to the performance.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because the performance was impossible, so they are discharged.

Alternatively, perhaps the store's refusal was valid, so the mill was held to the performance, but the performance was impossible, so the store would have to hold the mill to the performance.

Wait, I think the correct answer is A. Because the performance was impossible due to the event, so the mill would be discharged.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of it as a performance obligation. If the performance is impossible because of an unforeseen event, the contract is discharged. So, the mill's performance would be discharged by impossibility.

So, the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around whether a performance obligation is discharged or excused by an unforeseen event, such as a forest fire, that affected the delivery of plywood. The key issue is whether the performance of the contract would be discharged by impossibility or excused, and the options provided must be evaluated based on the relevant legal principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Performance Obligations and Unforeseen Events**:  
   - Performance obligations are enforceable if the performance is possible but impossible due to unforeseen events. This falls under the doctrine of "impossibility discharging."  
   - If the performance was impossible due to an unforeseen event, the contract would typically be discharged, meaning the obligations are discharged by the impossibility of the performance.

2. **The Scenario**:  
   - The lumber mill contracted to deliver plywood for 10 months starting June 1.  
   - The first three months (June, July, August) were delivered on time and paid for.  
   - On August 16, the mill informed the store that the reserve would be destroyed by a forest fire, making the delivery of September's plywood impossible.  
   - The store refused to excuse the mill, forcing the mill to hold the store to the agreed performance terms.  
   - The store sued for breach of contract, and the question is whether the court would hold the mill responsible.

3. **Evaluating the Options**:  
   - **Option A**: "Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility."  
     - This aligns with the doctrine that if the performance is impossible due to an unforeseen event, the contract would be discharged. The mill had to perform on time, but the event (fire) caused the performance to be impossible. Thus, the mill's performance would be discharged by impossibility.  
   - **Option B**: "Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused."  
     - Incorrect. The mill's performance was possible, but it was impossible due to the event. Therefore, excusing the mill would not be appropriate.  
   - **Option C**: "Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance."  
     - Incorrect. The forest fire was an unforeseen event, not a cause of obvious hindrance.  
   - **Option D**: "Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose."  
     - Incorrect. Frustration of purpose refers to the inability to achieve a purpose due to circumstances, which does not apply here.  
   - **Option E**: "Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control."  
     - Incorrect. The forest fire was the mill's own liability, not beyond their control.  
   - **Option F**: "Judgment for the mill, because they had informed the store about the issue in advance."  
     - Incorrect. The store's refusal to excuse the mill was a valid defense, not based on prior notification.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The correct answer is **A**: The mill would be discharged by impossibility because the performance was impossible due to the unforeseen event (forest fire). The mill had to perform on time, but the fire caused the performance to be impossible, making it dischargeable.
