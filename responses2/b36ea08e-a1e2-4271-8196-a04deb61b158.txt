Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the punitive damages rule. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the nuances, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a worker injured in a California plant and her case in federal court in Washington. The issue is whether the state where she's based (Washington) allows punitive damages, and if her state doesn't, whether the court should apply the rule elsewhere.

First, I remember that the Strict Construction rule applies to federal courts. So if the case is in a federal court, the state's laws may not apply, or they have to follow the rule. The question is about whether the rule applies in the state she's in or the federal court.

Looking at the options, let's see.

A: Apply federal rule in federal court. That makes sense because the federal court would probably follow the strict rule unless the state law allows it.

B: Apply in California, which is where the accident is. No, because the state law in California might allow punitive damages, but it's the federal court that would determine the state's applicability.

C: Apply in Washington where the lawsuit was filed. But the state's laws might not apply, so the federal court should decide.

D: Apply in California where the accident occurred. No, the accident in California doesn't directly affect where the lawsuit is filed in Washington.

E: Let the jury decide based on state laws. That doesn't sound right; the court has the power to decide.

F: Apply in Washington where the court is located. But federal courts are in the state, so that doesn't apply.

G: Apply in Washington where she resides. That could be a stretch, but her location is Washington, so maybe the state's laws apply.

H: Apply in the state with the best law for the plaintiff. That's a bit vague, but the plaintiff's state's laws might not apply.

I: Apply in the state with best law for the plaintiff. Same as H, but phrased differently.

J: Apply in the state with best law for the company's headquarters. That seems unrelated.

Wait, the question is about the state where the plaintiff is located (Washington) allowing punitive damages, but she's suing in the same state. So the state's laws might allow it, but the court, being a federal court, might not. So the court should apply the strict rule in the federal court, which is the same state's case.

Looking at the options, option A says apply the federal rule in federal court. That seems correct because the federal court would follow the state's strict rule if it applies. The question is whether the state's law applies in the state where she's based, but the court's jurisdiction is in the same state.

So the correct answer should be A because it's the federal court that would apply the strict rule, regardless of the state's laws. The plaintiff's state might allow it, but the federal court decides the state's applicability.

The correct answer is A: Apply the federal punitive damage rule since the case is in a federal court. The federal court would follow the strict rule unless the state's laws allow it, and the plaintiff's state may allow punitive damages but the federal court decides the applicability. 

Answer: A
