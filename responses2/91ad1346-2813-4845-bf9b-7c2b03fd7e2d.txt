Okay, so I'm trying to solve this logic problem. Let's read it again carefully. The question is asking to translate a sentence into predicate logic, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

The sentence is: "Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl."

Hmm, breaking it down. The main structure here is a biconditional, which uses "if and only if." So, the entire statement is saying that Bc (Cecilia breaks my heart) happens only when Maria is either a problem (Pm) or a girl (Gm). So, in logical terms, it's something like Bc ↔ (Pm ∨ Gm). But wait, I need to look at the answer options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options, let's go one by one:

Option A: Bc ⊃ (Pm ⊃ Gm)
Hmm, this is a chain implication. It suggests that if Bc is true, then Pm implies Gm. Not sure if that's correct. I think a biconditional needs both directions, so A might not be right.

Option B: Cb ⊃ (Pm • Gm)
This is Cb implies that Maria is a problem and a girl. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the original statement is about Maria being either a problem or a girl, not both. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Bc ≡ (Pm ⊃ Gm)
This is a biconditional between Bc and (Pm implies Gm). So Bc is true only when Pm implies Gm. But the original statement is a biconditional between Bc and (Pm or Gm). So C doesn't seem to match.

Option D: Bc ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm)
This is Bc implies that Maria is a problem or a girl. But the original says it's an "if and only if," meaning both directions. So D is just one part but doesn't include the "only if" part. So D is not the correct answer.

Option E: Bc ≡ (Pm • Gm)
This is Bc equivalent to Maria being a problem and a girl. But again, the original uses "either...or," not "and." So E is wrong.

Option F: Cb ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm)
This is similar to D but with a different connective. It says Bc implies Maria is a problem or a girl. But wait, no, in the question, the "and only if" part is in the original, which makes it a biconditional. So F is missing the "only if" part, making it incorrect.

Option G: Bc ≡ (Gm • Pm)
Same issue as D and E. It's a biconditional between Bc and both Gm and Pm. But the original is a biconditional between Bc and (Pm or Gm). So G is incorrect.

Option H: Cb ⊃ (Gm ∨ Pm)
This is similar to F. Cb implies that Maria is a girl or a problem. Again, the original uses "either/or," which H uses with "or." Wait, but the structure is Cb implies (Gm or Pm), which is a one-way implication. Since the original is a biconditional, H isn't correct.

Option I: Bc ⊃ (Pm • Gm)
This is again similar to D and E, just the conjunction in the antecedent. It's missing the "if and only if" part. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm)
This is a biconditional between Bc and Maria being a problem or a girl. But the original uses "and only if," which is a biconditional, but the way it's phrased is a bit different. Let me think again. The original statement is Bc breaks my heart only when Maria is a problem or a girl. So the condition is that Bc happens if and only if Maria is a problem or a girl. So the correct biconditional is Bc ↔ (Pm ∨ Gm). But none of the options directly match this.

Wait, looking back at the options, J is Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm). That's a biconditional between Bc and (Pm or Gm). But in English, "if and only if" can sometimes be expressed as two separate implications. So the original is a biconditional, which J is also a biconditional. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is that Bc is true exactly when (Pm or Gm) is true. So the correct translation is Bc if and only if (Pm or Gm). Which would be Bc ↔ (Pm ∨ Gm), which is what option J says.

Wait, let me think again. The sentence is: Bc breaks my heart if and only if Maria is either a problem or a girl. So it's a biconditional between Bc and (Pm or Gm). So the correct logic is Bc ↔ (Pm ∨ Gm). But looking at the options, J says Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm), which is a biconditional. But in predicate logic, the biconditional is represented with ≡, but in the options, it's using ≡ as well. So J is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the original statement a biconditional or a disjunction? The question says "if and only if," which is a biconditional. So the correct way is to have both implications, which is a biconditional. So J is the biconditional, which is correct.

But wait, let's check other options. Option D is Bc → (Pm ∨ Gm), which is one direction of the biconditional. But since it's a biconditional, both directions are needed. So among the options, J is the correct one because it includes both directions as a single biconditional.

So the correct answer should be J: Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm).
</think>

The correct translation of the statement into predicate logic is a biconditional where Bc (Cecilia breaks my heart) is equivalent to Maria being a problem or a girl. This is represented by option J, which accurately captures both directions of the equivalence.

Answer: J
