Okay, so I've got this question about audit independence. Hmm, the question is asking which situation would not impair objectivity, integrity, or independence. Let me think through each option.

First, I need to remember the principles of audit independence. Objectivity, integrity, and independence are key to a good audit. Any situation that undermines these would be the answer.

Option A: An auditor's son is offered an internship. Wait, that's a personal matter. The auditor's son could be seen as a potential conflict. But does that affect the audit team's independence? I think it might. Because the son could be a potential source of conflict, but the audit team is probably independent, not directly involved. Or wait, the question is about the audit client's independence. So if the auditor's family is involved, that could be a problem. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe this affects the audit's independence, but I'm not certain.

Option B: An auditor invests a significant amount of money. Oh, that's a conflict of interest. If the auditor is involved in the client's investments, that's a violation of independence. So this definitely impairs independence. So it's not the correct answer.

Option C: An out-of-town client goes to a local restaurant. That's a business expense. It's a matter of fact, but it's a business decision. It's within the scope of normal business operations. But does it affect independence? No, because the client is just another client. Unless it's a large expense that's material, but the question says it's out of town, so perhaps it's a minor expense. So this wouldn't impair. So maybe this is a possible correct answer, but I need to see others.

Option D: A client offers the team a retreat. That's a significant expense. If it's a major expense, it's a conflict. So investment in the client's company would be a violation, which is part of integrity. So this would impair, so not the correct answer.

Option E: An auditor takes the team to a baseball game. That's a business expense, like travel. Probably minor, so not a problem.

Option F: Client offers discounts on products. That's a conflict. So this would violate independence. So this is a no-go.

Option G: Client gives the team concert tickets. Concert tickets are considered an expense. So this is a conflict, which would violate independence. So this is not the correct answer.

Option H: An auditor gives the CFO a luxury car. That's a significant expense and could be a conflict if the CFO is a high-value person. This would be a major conflict, so not independent.

Option I: Audit committee goes to Las Vegas. That's a business expense. So yes, it's a conflict. So this would be impaired, so not the answer.

Option J: Client takes the team on a two-day ski trip. That's a business expense. So again, a conflict. So this is impaired.

Wait, but wait. The question is which situation would not impair objectivity, integrity, or independence. So I'm looking for the correct answer that doesn't cause any of these issues.

Wait, let me go through each. The options are A to J.

I think the key here is whether the situation is a conflict or not. So any situation that's a conflict (i.e., involves a personal interest in the client) would be impaired.

So looking again.

Option A: The son is an intern. May be a potential conflict. But the audit team's independence is about their own conduct, not personal family matters. So this might not be an issue. Or wait, could the son's family involvement affect the audit's independence? I'm not sure. Maybe this doesn't directly impact the audit team's independence, so it might not be impaired. Hmm. So perhaps A is okay.

Wait, wait. The question is about the client's independence, not the audit team. So the scenario in A is about the audit client's family, not the audit team. So if the audit client's family is involved, that could be a conflict for the audit team, but the client's own independence is a separate matter. Wait, but the question is about the situation that would not impair the client's independence. So in this case, the client's family (the son's) is involved, which could be a conflict, but does that affect the audit team's independence? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the scenario in A is a personal matter, so it's not a conflict from the audit team's perspective. So the audit team's independence isn't affected.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is A because the situation doesn't directly affect the audit's independence, but the problem is whether the situation itself impairs the client's independence. So if the son is offered an internship, the audit team could be affected if the son is a potential conflict. But the question is about the client's independence, so this wouldn't directly impair. So perhaps A is okay.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of other options.

Looking at the others, options B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J: each is a conflict. So the ones that are not would be the ones that don't involve any of these.

Only option A so far. Because the others are all conflicts. Wait, but wait. Option A is about the son being an intern. The son's family involvement is a personal issue. The audit team would have to consider whether the son is a potential source of conflict. But from the audit client's perspective, the son is just a client, but the audit team's own conduct is not directly affected by that. So perhaps A doesn't implicate the client's independence, but the problem is whether it affects the audit client's independence.

Wait, the question is which situation would not impair the client's independence. So A is about the son being an intern, which is a personal connection. But the audit client might have a personal issue with the son, but the question is about the audit client's own independence. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps looking for the correct answer, which is the one that doesn't affect the client's independence. So the only correct answer is A. Because the others are all conflicts, so they all impair, leaving A as the correct answer.

To determine which situation would not impair objectivity, integrity, or independence with respect to an audit client, we analyze each option:

- **Option A**: An auditor's son is offered an internship at the client's company. While this involves a personal matter, it does not directly affect the audit client's independence. The audit team's independence is not impacted by the son's personal connection to the client. Thus, this situation does not impair the audit client's independence.

- **Option B**: An auditor invests a significant amount of money in the client's company. This is a conflict of interest, directly impairing the audit client's integrity and independence.

- **Option C**: An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant. This is a minor business expense and does not affect the audit client's independence.

- **Option D**: A client offers the audit team a significant investment in the client's company. This is a conflict of interest, directly impairing the audit client's integrity and independence.

- **Option E**: An auditor provides client management with box seats for the season at a major league baseball franchise. This is a minor business expense and does not affect the audit client's independence.

- **Option F**: The audit team members are given a significant discount on the client's products. This is a conflict of interest, directly impairing the audit client's integrity and independence.

- **Option G**: A client provides the audit engagement team with front-row concert tickets. This is a minor business expense and does not affect the audit client's independence.

- **Option H**: An auditor gives the client's CFO a luxury car. This is a conflict of interest, directly impairing the audit client's integrity and independence.

- **Option I**: An auditor takes the client’s audit committee to Las Vegas for the weekend. This is a minor business expense and does not affect the audit client's independence.

- **Option J**: A client takes the audit engagement team on a two-day ski trip after the audit team worked for two consecutive weekends. This is a minor business expense and does not affect the audit client's independence.

Among all options, **Option A** is the only one that does not directly impede the audit client's independence, as it concerns personal matters rather than the audit client's own conduct.

**ANSWER: A**
