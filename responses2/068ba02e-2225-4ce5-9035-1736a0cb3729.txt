Okay, so I've got this problem here about least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD). Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says: The least common multiple of two positive integers divided by their greatest common divisor gives 33. One of the integers is 45. I need to find the smallest possible value of the other integer. The options are A to J, and the answer has to be one of those.

Hmm, let me recall some number theory. I remember that for two numbers, the product of their LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the numbers. So, LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b. Maybe that can help here.

So, the problem states that (LCM(a, b)) / (GCD(a, b)) = 33. Let me denote the two integers as a and b, where a is 45. So, LCM(45, b) / GCD(45, b) = 33.

From the formula I just thought of, LCM(45, b) * GCD(45, b) = 45 * b. But we can rearrange that. Let me let LCM(45, b) be 33 * GCD(45, b). So, substituting into the formula: (33 * GCD(45, b)) * GCD(45, b) = 45 * b.

That simplifies to 33 * (GCD(45, b))² = 45 * b. So, 33 * (GCD)^2 = 45 * b.

Wait, let me write it out:

33 * (GCD)^2 = 45 * b.

So, solving for b gives b = (33 * (GCD)^2) / 45.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. I have 33*(GCD)^2 = 45*b, so b = (33/45)*(GCD)^2. Simplify 33/45: that's 11/15. So, b = (11/15)*(GCD)^2.

But since b must be an integer, (11/15)*(GCD)^2 must be an integer. So, 15 must divide (GCD)^2, because 11 and 15 are coprime. So, (GCD)^2 must be a multiple of 15. Since 15 factors into 3*5, so (GCD)^2 must be a multiple of both 3 and 5, meaning GCD must be a multiple of both 3 and 5, i.e., 15. Alternatively, maybe GCD is a multiple of 15? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, no. If (GCD)^2 is a multiple of 15, then GCD must be a multiple of the square roots of 3 and 5. But since GCD is an integer, the GCD must be a multiple of 15 (since 15 is 3*5 and 15 squared is 225, which is 3^2*5^2). So, GCD must be a multiple of 15. Let me denote GCD as d, so d = 15*k, where k is a positive integer.

Wait, but d must be a divisor of 45 because GCD(45, b) can't be larger than 45. So, d must be a divisor of 45 and also a multiple of 15. Let me list the divisors of 45. The divisors are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45. Among these, the ones that are multiples of 15 are 15 and 45.

So, d could be 15 or 45. Let's test each possibility.

Case 1: d = 15.

Then, from earlier, b = (33*(d)^2)/45 = (33*(225))/45 = (33*5) = 165. Because 225 divided by 45 is 5. So, b is 165.

Case 2: d = 45.

Then, b = (33*(45)^2)/45 = 33*45 = 1485. That's a larger number, but since 165 is smaller than 1485, 165 would be the smaller possible value.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me verify with the actual LCM and GCD.

Let me take a =45 and b=165.

What's the GCD of 45 and 165? Well, 45 factors into 3^2 *5. 165 factors into 5*33, which is 5*3*11. So, the GCD is the product of the minimum exponents of shared primes. So, both have 5 and 3. So, GCD is 3*5=15. That's correct.

Now, the LCM of 45 and 165. LCM is the product divided by GCD. So, (45*165)/15 = (45/15)*165 = 3*165 = 495.

So, 495 divided by 15 is 33. Which matches the given condition. So, that's correct.

So, the smallest possible value is 165. Looking at the options, B is 15, which is smaller than 165, but wait, did I make a mistake? Because 165 is larger than 15.

Wait, let me double-check the problem statement. Oh! Wait, the question is asking for the smallest possible value of the other integer. So, in the case where d =15, b=165. But wait, wait, maybe I missed another possible d.

Wait, another possible d is when GCD is 15, which gives b=165. What if d is 5?

Wait, earlier I thought d must be a multiple of 15 because it must be a divisor of 45 and a multiple of 15. Let me see. The divisors of 45 are 1,3,5,9,15,45. So, the possible d values are 15 and 45. So, if d=15, b=165, which is larger than 45, but 45 is already one of the options, but the question says one of them is 45, and the other is to be found. So, 45 is already given, but 45 is an option. Wait, no, wait, the problem says "the least common multiple of two positive integers is divided by their greatest common divisor, the result is 33."

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. I assumed that d must be a multiple of 15. But perhaps I was wrong in that assumption. Let me re-examine that step.

Earlier, I had 33*(d)^2 = 45*b. So, b = (33/45)*d^2 = (11/15)*d^2. For b to be an integer, (11/15)*d^2 must be integer. Since 11 and 15 are coprime, d^2 must be a multiple of 15. Which implies that d must be a multiple of sqrt(15), but since d is an integer, 15 must divide d. Wait, no, 15 divides d^2. So, d^2 must be divisible by 15. Since 15 is 3*5, so d must be divisible by both 3 and 5, because if d^2 is divisible by 3 and 5, then d must be divisible by 3 and 5. So, d must be a multiple of 15.

So, yes, d can be 15 or 45, as we thought before.

So, the smallest possible value is 165, which is option B. But wait, the options include 30 and some others. Let me check another possibility.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me try a different approach. Let me denote LCM(a, b) as L. GCD(a, b) as G. Then, L/G = 33. Also, LCM(a, b)*GCD(a, b) = a*b. So, L*G = 45*b. But also, L = 33*G. Substituting, 33*G*G = 45*b. So, 33G² =45b.

So, b = (33G²)/45 = (11 G²)/15.

So, for b to be integer, 15 must divide 11 G². Since 11 is prime and doesn't divide 15, G² must be divisible by 15. So, G must be divisible by both 3 and 5, hence G must be a multiple of 15. So, G can be 15, 30, etc. But G has to be a divisor of 45 because GCD(45, b) can't be larger than 45.

So, the possible G values are 15 and 45.

If G=15: then b = (11*(15)^2)/15 = (11*225)/15 = 11*15 = 165.

If G=45: then b = (11*(45)^2)/15 = (11*2025)/15 = 11*135=1485.

So, the possible values for b are 165 and 1485. So, the smallest possible is 165.

Looking at the options, 165 is option B.

Wait, but wait, the options include 30. Maybe I missed something. Let me check if 30 is a possible value for b.

If b=30, let's compute LCM(45,30). The LCM of 45 and 30. Let's factor them: 45=3²*5, 30=2*3*5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes. So, 2^1 *3^2 *5^1 = 2*9*5=90.

Then, LCM(45,30)/GCD(45,30). GCD(45,30) is 15. So, 90/15=6. But the problem states that this should be 33. So, 6≠33, so 30 is not a valid option.

Wait, but the options include 30, so maybe I did something wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, 30: GCD(45,30)=15. LCM(45,30)=90. 90/15=6, which is not 33. So, 30 can't be the answer.

Wait, but earlier when I thought b=165, it worked. Let me see if any other options could work.

Another option: Let me check 15. Suppose b=15.

GCD(45,15)=15. LCM(45,15)=45. 45/15=3. Not 33. So, no.

What about 45: GCD(45,45)=45. LCM(45,45)=45. 45/45=1≠33. So, nope.

Another option: 9. Let me check.

GCD(45,9)=9. LCM(45,9)=45. 45/9=5≠33. So, no.

66: Let me compute.

GCD(45,66). 45 factors: 3^2 *5. 66: 2*3*11. So GCD is 3.

LCM(45,66) is LCM(45,66). Let's compute. Factors: 45=3²*5, 66=2*3*11. So LCM is 2*3²*5*11= 2*9*5*11= 990.

So, LCM/GCD is 990 /3=330≠33. So, no.

Option D: 45. As above, it gives 1. Not 33.

Option J:46. Wait, 46 is 2*23. Let me check.

GCD(45,46)=1. LCM(45,46)=45*46=2070.

2070/1=2070≠33. So, no.

Option F:30, which we saw gives 6.

Option C:90. Let me check.

GCD(45,90)=45. LCM(45,90)=90. 90/45=2≠33. So, no.

Option G:9. GCD is 9, LCM is 45. 45/9=5≠33.

Option A:225. GCD(45,225)=45. LCM(45,225)=225. 225/45=5≠33.

Option E:46, we saw it's 2070.

So, the only option that works is 165, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought 15 was an option. But 15 gives LCM/GCD=6.

Wait, but wait, what about a different approach. Let me think about the relationship between LCM and GCD.

We have LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/GCD(a,b) = 33 * GCD(a,b).

So, (45*b)/(GCD(45,b)) = 33 * GCD(45,b). So, 45*b = 33*(GCD)^2.

Which simplifies to: b = (33/45)*(GCD)^2 = (11/15)*(GCD)^2.

So, for b to be integer, (GCD)^2 must be divisible by 15. So, GCD must be a multiple of 15. So, GCD is 15 or 45.

Thus, when GCD is 15, b= (11*15^2)/15=11*15=165. So, 165 is possible.

So, 165 is the only possible value that meets the conditions, and it's the smallest possible because the other options when tested don't satisfy the condition.

The problem requires finding the smallest possible value of another integer when the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers is divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), resulting in 33. One integer is given as 45. Using the relationship LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b, we derive that LCM(45, b) * GCD(45, b) = 45 * b. Given that LCM(45, b) / GCD(45, b) = 33, we find that 33 * (GCD)^2 = 45 * b. Solving for b, we find that b must be 165 when GCD is 15, which is the smallest possible value.
