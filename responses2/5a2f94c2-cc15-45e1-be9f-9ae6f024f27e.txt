Okay, so I have this question about converting hexadecimal numbers to binary. Let me think. Hexadecimal is base 16, and binary is base 2. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits because 16 is 2^4. So, each hex digit is 4 bits in binary. For example, A in hex is 1010 in binary. So, each of the four bits corresponds to one hex digit. That means each hex digit translates to four binary bits. So the answer should be B: 2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, "how many bits for each hex digit." So each hex digit is 4 bits. So the options are A:1, B:2, C:4, D:8. So the correct choice is C:4.

The correct answer is **C: 4**. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four bits in binary because hexadecimal is base 16 and binary is base 2, with 16 being 2‚Å¥. Therefore, each hex digit is represented by four binary bits.

Answer: C
