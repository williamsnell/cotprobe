Question:

Two brothers owned a parcel of real estate as joint tenants. Both brothers signed a deed as grantors conveying the land to the buyer. The first brother handed the deed to the second brother with instructions to take the deed to their lawyer for approval prior to delivery. Brother two, without his brother's permission, took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price. Is this a good deed as to partner one?

Options:

A: Yes, the deed was signed by both partners, which proved their intent to sell to buyer, and it was delivered at the time of signing by the fact of affixing their signatures to the document.
B: Yes, the deed is valid as the buyer was not aware of the internal agreement between the two brothers.
C: No, the deed is invalid as partner one did not give explicit permission for partner two to deliver the deed.
D: Yes, the deed is valid as partner two had the authority to finalize the deal.
E: No, the deed is invalid because partner two collected the sale price without partner one's consent.
F: Yes, the deed is valid as both brothers had signed it, signifying their agreement to the sale.
G: Yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because partner two was partner one's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.
H: No, the deed was invalid as to both grantors because partner two stepped outside his scope of authority.
I: No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.
J: No, the deed is not valid as the lawyer did not approve it before delivery.

Okay, so I've got this real estate question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to property law, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about whether a deed is valid as a joint tenancy between two brothers. Both signed as grantors, and the first brother gave the deed to the second brother, instructing him to get it approved before delivery. The second brother then took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the price.

The options are A to J, each giving different answers. I need to determine whether this deed is valid as to partner one (the first brother). Hmm, let's break it down.

First, let's recall what a joint tenancy is. A joint tenancy means that the two partners (or grantors) are both owners, and they have the legal capacity to enter into a deed. Each has the power to convey the property to others, but they can't enforce their own actions on the property.

So, the key here is whether partner two (the second brother) had the authority to deliver the deed. The first brother gave the deed to the second, but the second didn't get the signature from the first. The first brother's instruction was to get it approved before deliveryâ€”so maybe that's a condition for delivery.

In real property, when one transferor grants another to do something, the grantor (first brother) doesn't have the right to deny the grantor's consent when the other (second) delivers. But if the grantor gave a condition, like signing first, that might affect it.

Wait, the deed was signed by both, and the first brother handed it to the second. The second signed it to their lawyer for approval. So the second brother didn't get the signature. But perhaps the first brother's instruction to the second to get approval before delivery is a condition that the second must meet.

In the context of a joint tenancy, each grantor has the ability to convey the property. So the second brother, even without the first's signature, should be able to deliver it. Because the deed is a joint tenancy, each partner can take the deed and convey it.

But wait, the first brother handed it over without the second's consent, but the second delivered it to the buyer after getting the first brother's signature. But the first brother's instruction was to get the approval before delivery. So perhaps the second didn't get the signature, so he can't deliver. Or does the grantor's signature take precedence?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. In a joint tenancy, each grantor is an owner and can convey the property. The grantor's intent to convey is what makes it valid. So in this case, the deed was signed by both, and they both had the authority to convey.

But the first brother handed it to the second, who then delivered it. So the second, as a grantor, would have the authority to convey, even if the first didn't. But the first brother gave the second instructions to get approval before delivery. So if the second doesn't get the signature, would he be allowed to deliver?

Wait, the first brother's instruction was to have the second sign off for approval. So perhaps the second didn't get the first's signature, thus not being able to deliver. But that's a bit tricky. In a joint tenancy, each partner is a grantor, so they have the authority to convey, regardless of the order of signing. So the second brother, even without the first's signature, should be able to deliver and convey the deed.

Wait no, the first brother's instruction was to get the second to sign for approval. So perhaps the second didn't receive the first's signature, so he couldn't deliver. But in a joint tenancy, each grantor is an owner and has the ability to convey. So even without the first's signature, the second can take the deed and convey it.

Wait, but the deed was signed by both. The deed is a joint tenancy, so each has the right to convey. So the second can take it and convey it to the buyer.

Wait, but the second didn't get the first's signature. But the first's instruction was to get the second to sign off for approval, so perhaps the second didn't get the first's signature, so he couldn't deliver. But that's not right because the first's instruction was to get the second to sign, not to get the first to sign.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The deed was signed by both. The first brother gave the deed to the second, instructing the second to get the signature from the first for approval. So the second didn't get the first's signature. But as a joint tenancy, the second can still take the deed and convey it to the buyer because he has the authority. So the deed should be valid as to partner one.

Wait, but the first brother might have intended the second to sign, but the second didn't. So perhaps the second didn't have the authority to deliver because he didn't receive the first's signature. But in a joint tenancy, the grantor's intent is to convey, and the grantee's intent is to receive. So the first's instruction was to get the second to sign, but the second didn't. So the second might not be able to deliver. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the deed was signed by both, so each has the authority to convey. So the second must be able to take the deed and convey it, regardless of the first's signature. The first's instruction was to get the second to sign off for approval, but that's probably a separate condition. The second can still take the deed and convey it.

Therefore, the deed should be valid for partner one. So the answer should be E: No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.

Wait, but option E says the deed is invalid because partner two collected the price without partner one's consent. That would imply partner two had the authority, which I don't think is the case.

Wait, the options. Let me look again:

Option E: No, the deed is invalid because partner two collected the sale price without partner one's consent.

Wait, that sounds like partner two didn't consent to deliver the deed, so the deed is invalid because partner two didn't agree to deliver it. But in a joint tenancy, each partner can transfer the deed to the buyer, so the second shouldn't have to wait for the first's consent.

Alternatively, perhaps the second didn't get the first's consent to deliver, so he can't take the deed, but that's not right because each is a grantor.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to look up the concept of implied consent in joint tenancies.

In a joint tenancy, each grantor has the intent to convey the property. The grantor's intent is to transfer and deliver the property to the grantee. The grantor's consent is implied because the grantee cannot demand the property unless the grantor conveys it. But the grantor's intent is to convey, regardless of the grantee's demand.

But in this case, the first brother gave the deed to the second, instructing him to get the signature from the first before delivery. So the second didn't get the first's signature. But the first's instruction was to get the second's signature. So perhaps the second didn't have the first's consent to give the deed.

Wait, no, that's not right. The first's instruction was to have the second sign off for approval. So the second didn't get the first's signature, so he didn't have the first's consent. But in a joint tenancy, each grantor can convey the property regardless of the order of signing. So the second must have the authority to take and convey the deed, even without the first's consent.

Wait, but the first brother's instructions were to have the second sign off, so the second might not have the first's consent. So the second didn't have the first's consent to deliver the deed, which is required for the first to convey it.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think again about the deed's validity.

In a joint tenancy, each grantor is an owner and has the capacity to convey the property. So each has the authority to take the deed and convey it to the buyer, regardless of the order of signing.

So the second brother must have the authority to take the deed (because he's a grantor), and thus can deliver it to the buyer. So the deed is valid for partner one, because partner two has the authority to convey it.

Wait, but partner two didn't get the first's consent to take the deed. Does the grantee's consent (to receive) affect the grantor's ability to take the deed? No, because each is a grantor. So partner two can take the deed, even if the first didn't sign.

Wait, but the first brother gave the deed to the second, instructing the second to get the first's signature. So the second didn't get the first's. But in a joint tenancy, each partner is a grantor, so the second can take the deed and convey it. So the first's instruction was a condition for delivery, but since the second didn't sign, he can still take the deed and deliver it.

Wait, but the first's instruction was to have the second sign off for approval. So perhaps the second didn't get the first's consent to sign off, meaning he couldn't deliver. But in a joint tenancy, the grantee (buyer) doesn't have to consent to deliver unless they agree. So the second can deliver the deed without the first's consent, because each is a grantor.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me consider the options again.

Option A: Yes, both partners signed, intent to sell, delivered at their signing. I think delivery at their signing is the case.

Option B: Yes, buyer wasn't aware. But in a joint tenancy, the buyer can't demand unless the grantor conveys.

Option C: No because partner one didn't give explicit consent. I don't think so, because in a joint tenancy, each grantor can convey regardless.

Option D: Yes, partner two was the agent. Not sure.

Option E: No, because partner two didn't get partner one's consent. Wait, I thought partner two could take the deed regardless of the first's consent. So maybe E is incorrect.

Wait, the first brother's instruction was to have the second get the first's signature, which was a condition for delivery. So the second might have to give the first's consent. Wait, no, the first's instruction was to have the second sign off for approval, but maybe the second didn't.

Wait, perhaps the second brother didn't have the first's consent to take the deed. But in a joint tenancy, each is a grantor, so the second must have the authority to take the deed (because the first is a grantor). So the second can take the deed, even without the first's consent, because the grantee doesn't have to consent unless they do.

Wait, I'm getting myself into a muddle. Let me think of it another way: In a joint tenancy, each grantor is an owner and can convey the property to the buyer. So the second can take the deed and convey it to the buyer.

So the deed is valid for partner one. Therefore, the answer would be E? No, but option E says the deed is invalid because partner two didn't get partner one's consent. But in a joint tenancy, partner two can deliver, regardless of partner one's consent.

Wait, but the first's instruction was to have partner two sign off for approval. So perhaps partner two didn't get the first's consent, so he can't deliver. But that's not correct because each is a grantor. So maybe the deed is valid as to partner one because partner two has the authority to take and convey.

Wait, but the first brother's instruction was a condition for delivery, but partner two didn't get the first's consent. So he can't take the deed because he didn't get the first's signature. But that would require a condition for taking, which in a joint tenancy isn't the case. So perhaps the second didn't get the first's consent, so he couldn't take the deed, and thus couldn't convey it. But that would make the deed invalid because partner two didn't have the authority to take it.

Wait, but that contradicts the fact that each is a grantor. So this seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the first brother's instruction was a condition for delivery, but the second brother didn't have the first's consent, so he couldn't deliver. But in a joint tenancy, the buyer can't demand the deed without partner two delivering it. So if partner two can't deliver, the deed is invalid.

Wait, but each is a grantor, so they have the authority to convey. So partner two can take the deed, regardless of partner one's consent. So the first's instruction is a condition for delivery, but the second can still take it and deliver it.

Wait, but the first brother's instruction was to have the second sign off for approval. So perhaps the second didn't get the first's signature, so he can't take the deed because he didn't get the first's consent. But that would mean the first's instruction was to have partner two sign off, but he didn't, so he can't take the deed. But how does that affect the delivery? If you can't take it, then you can't deliver it, so the deed is invalid.

Wait, that makes sense. So the second brother didn't get the first's consent to take the deed because he didn't receive the first's signature. Therefore, he can't take the deed, so he can't deliver it. So the deed is invalid because partner two couldn't deliver it, which means partner one couldn't enforce the deed.

So looking at the options, which one says that? Option E says the deed is invalid because partner two didn't get partner one's consent. So the deed is invalid, so partner one can't bind him.

Wait, but in a joint tenancy, each grantor is an owner and can convey. So if partner two can't take the deed, then he can't deliver it. So the deed is invalid. So option E would be correct.

Alternatively, option J says no, the lawyer didn't approve. But the first brother gave the deed to the second brother, instructing to get the signature from the first. So the first brother's instruction was to have the second give the signature. So perhaps the second didn't get it, so he can't take the deed. So the deed would be invalid.

So the correct answer would be option E: No, the deed is invalid because partner two didn't get partner one's consent.

The question revolves around whether a deed is valid as to partner one in a joint tenancy, where both partners signed a deed conveying the property. Partner one (the first brother) handed the deed to partner two (the second brother) with the instruction to get the first's signature for approval. Partner two, however, did not receive the first's signature, and thus did not have the necessary consent to deliver the deed.

In a joint tenancy, each grantor is an owner with the authority to convey the property. Partner two, as a grantor, must have the ability to take the deed and convey it to the buyer. The first brother's instruction to partner two to sign off for approval was a condition for delivery, but partner two did not receive the first's signature. This means partner two lacked the necessary consent to take the deed. Consequently, partner two could not deliver the deed to the buyer, making the deed invalid.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While both partners signed and intended to sell, the key issue is consent, not delivery at the time of signing.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The buyer's lack of demand doesn't affect the validity of the deed.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. There is no explicit lack of consent required for delivery.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Partner two is a grantor and has the authority to convey the deed.
- **Option E**: Correct. Partner two lacked the consent to deliver the deed, making the deed invalid.
- **Option F to J**: Incorrect. They fail to address the lack of consent for delivery.

The deed is invalid because partner two did not obtain the first's consent to take the deed, which is a prerequisite for delivery. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: E
