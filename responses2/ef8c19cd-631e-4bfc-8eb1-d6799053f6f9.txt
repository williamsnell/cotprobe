Okay, so I've got this question about the market for denim jeans and how a change in the price of polyester pants affects the jean market. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in economics, when the price of a substitute good increases, it affects the demand for related goods. So, the main thing here is to figure out whether polyester pants is a substitute for denim jeans. I believe they are, because substitute goods are products that can be used in place of each other. So, if someone buys more of one, they might buy the other too.

The question says the price of polyester pants (a substitute) increases. So that should influence the demand for denim jeans. Let me recall: when a substitute's price goes up, the demand for the original good usually decreases. Because if I can get the substitute for the same price, I'd buy more of it. So if polyester is more expensive, maybe I'll need to buy more denim jeans instead.

Wait, no—that's the opposite. If the substitute is a good that's a substitute, then a rise in its price would make it less attractive. So, the demand for the original good (denim) would decrease. So, the demand for denim jeans would decrease. Because people are probably more likely to buy other brands or more of the substitute.

So, the demand curve for denim jeans would shift to the left, meaning the quantity demanded at any given price decreases.

But wait, the question is about the market for denim jeans. So, the market is in equilibrium initially. So, before the price change, the supply and demand were in balance. Now, the price of polyester pants has gone up. How does that affect the market for jeans?

Wait, another thing to consider is the supply side. If the price of something else changes, it might affect supply as well. But in this case, it's a substitute. Substitute goods—like, if the price of a substitute increases, the demand for the original goes down, but the supply of the original might not change if the substitute isn't directly affecting the production of the original product. Or wait, maybe the question is assuming that the supply is unaffected.

Wait, I should think about it again. If the substitute (polyester) is more expensive, does that affect the supply of denim jeans? No, because the production of jeans doesn't depend on the price of another product. So the supply curve remains the same.

So, the only thing changing is the demand. The demand curve shifts left. So, in the jeans market, the equilibrium price will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will decrease because the demand has gone down.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one reflects this. Let's look at the options:

Option B says demand rises, quantity increases. That's the opposite. So not B.

Option C: demand rises, quantity decreases. No, because polyester is a substitute, so demand should fall.

Option F: demand rises, quantity increases. No, same issue.

Option G: supply rises, price up, quantity down. But in this case, supply isn't changing. So G is incorrect.

Option H: supply falls, price up, quantity down. But supply isn't affected by the price of another good unless it's a complement. So H is incorrect.

Option E: supply rises, price decrease, quantity up. That would happen if supply increases, but here supply is unchanged.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The situation is that the price of polyester (a substitute) increases. So, in the jeans market, which is in equilibrium (price and quantity are stable), the substitution effect would make people buy more of the original good (denim) because the substitute is now more expensive. So, demand for denim decreases.

So, the demand curve shifts left, leading to lower price and lower quantity.

Looking at the options, the only one where demand decreases is option F (demand rises, but that's wrong). Option B, C, G, H, E, etc., don't fit.

Wait, the options are:

A: supply falls, price up, quantity up. Hmm, supply decreases and price goes up—like a supply-side shock.

B: demand rises (so people buy more), price goes down, quantity up. No, that's not what's happening.

C: demand rises, quantity increases. No, because substitute makes demand go down.

D: demand falls, price down, quantity up. No, because the substitution effect leads to demand falling, but the question is about the overall supply/demand.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the substitution effect with the supply effect. The substitution effect says that when the price of a substitute increases, the demand for the original decreases. The supply effect says that if the substitute becomes more expensive, it reduces the cost of production for the original. Wait, no, that's not correct. If the substitute is more expensive, it's a substitute, so the original is more attractive. But for production, for example, if the substitute is more expensive, the cost of producing the original might go up. So, that would lead to a supply effect of increased production.

Wait, so production increase would lead to higher price, but that's the supply side effect. But the question is about market in equilibrium, so let's think about the main factor. The substitution effect is dominant here. So, the demand shifts left, leading to lower price and lower quantity.

So, the options that show demand decreasing are options F, H, etc. Wait, looking at the options:

Option F: demand rises, quantity increases. No, because substitute makes demand fall.

Wait, maybe none of the options perfectly fit. Let me look again.

Wait, option F: demand rises, quantity increases. No, because substitute leads to lower demand.

Wait, perhaps the options are a bit off. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: supply falls, price up, quantity up. → Doesn't fit.

B: demand rises, price down, quantity up. → No.

C: demand rises, price up, quantity down. → No.

D: demand falls, price down, quantity up. → No.

E: supply rises, price down, quantity up. → No.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about a change in the supply curve. Wait, no. The question says the price of polyester pants (a substitute) rises. So substitution effect leads to lower demand (down), supply effect – if the substitute becomes more expensive, the cost of producing jeans would increase (since polyester is a substitute), which would lead to higher production, so supply increases.

Wait, that would make the supply curve shift right. But the question doesn't mention anything about production costs, so I can't really say that. Unless the question is assuming that the supply isn't affected by the prices of other goods—like, if the price of another product affects the supply. But I think in this question, it's not considered. So, maybe the supply doesn't change. So only the demand effect matters.

Wait, but if the supply of jeans doesn't change, only the demand. So:

- Substitute effect: demand for jeans falls.

- So, supply remains same, demand decreases → price falls, quantity falls.

Looking back at the options, which one says demand falls, price falls, quantity falls.

Looking at the options:

D: demand falls, price down, quantity increases → No, quantity increases would mean supply was increasing, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the substitution effect and the production effect. Let me think again.

When the price of a substitute good (polyester) increases, it makes the substitute more expensive. So, for the original product (denim), the price effect is that people would buy more of it because it's now more affordable. So, that's the substitution effect. The substitution effect leads to lower demand.

The production effect (also known as the supply effect): if the substitute becomes more expensive, it reduces the cost of producing the original. So, that would lead to higher supply. So, the supply curve shifts right.

But the question is about the market for denim jeans. If the supply is affected by the price of the substitute, then the supply curve shifts. But the question doesn't mention this, so perhaps it's assumed that supply remains unchanged.

Wait, but if the question is only about the substitution effect, then the supply isn't a factor. So, the main effect is the substitution effect. So, the demand decreases (shift left), price decreases, quantity decreases.

Looking at the options, the only one that matches this is option F, which says demand rises, quantity increases. No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the direction of the substitution effect. Let me think again.

If the price of a substitute good increases, the demand for the original good decreases because you can now buy more of the substitute. So, the substitution effect is that demand falls.

So, the demand curve shifts left, leading to lower price and lower quantity.

Looking at the options, the only one that has demand falling is option F, G, D, E, I, etc.—but none correctly. Wait, let me look again.

Looking at the options:

E: supply rises, price down, quantity up → No.

H: supply falls, price up, quantity down → No, supply not affected here.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that demand decreases, but looking at the options, none of them directly match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the options are for the market for denim jeans. So, the substitution effect leads to a decrease in the demand for jeans, as people buy more of the substitute. So, the demand curve shifts left. 

So, in the jeans market, the equilibrium price will fall, and quantity will fall.

Looking at the options, which one shows that?

Option F: demand rises, quantity increases. No.

Option C: demand rises, quantity increases. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, another approach: substitution effect and supply effect.

Substitution effect: when the price of a substitute increases, the demand for the original decreases because the good is now more attractive.

Supply effect: if the substitute becomes more expensive, the cost of producing the original increases, so supply decreases (because it's more costly to produce the original, so you produce less) → supply effect leads to a decrease in supply.

Wait, but this is getting more complicated. The question isn't clear on whether we're considering the substitution effect or the supply effect. 

But the question is about the market for denim jeans. So, the substitution effect is the main factor. So, the overall effect is that demand decreases (because of substitution effect), which causes price to fall and quantity to fall.

Looking back at the options, which option indicates that? Let me re-examine the options.

Option F: demand rises, quantity increases. No.

Option B: demand rises, quantity up. No.

Option C: demand rises, quantity down. No.

Option D: demand falls, quantity up. No, because the substitution effect leads to lower quantity.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the options wrong. Let me look again.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: supply falls, price up, quantity up. → No.

B: demand rises, price down, quantity up. → No.

C: demand rises, quantity increases. → No.

D: demand falls, price down, quantity up. → No, because substitution effect leads to lower quantity.

E: supply rises, price down, quantity up. → No.

H: supply falls, price up, quantity down. → No.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is that the demand falls, price falls, quantity falls. But none of the options reflect that. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding the options. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution effect is correctly leading to a decrease in quantity, but the options don’t have that option.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

F: demand rises, quantity increases → No.

G: supply rises, price up, quantity down → No.

H: supply falls, price up, quantity down → No.

E: supply rises, price down, quantity up → No.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the question is about a change in the supply curve. Wait, no. The question says the price of polyester pants (a substitute) rises. So substitution effect leads to lower demand (shift left).

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check.

The options are:

A: supply falls, price up, quantity up.
B: demand rises, quantity up.
C: demand rises, quantity down.
D: demand falls, quantity up.
E: supply rises, price down, quantity up.
F: demand rises, quantity up.
G: supply rises, price up, quantity down.
H: supply falls, price up, quantity down.
I: demand falls, quantity down.
J: supply falls, price down, quantity down.

Wait, so the correct answer is not among the options because none of them reflect the substitution effect correctly. But that can’t be, because the question is a standard one.

Wait, another way: perhaps the question is about the supply curve. Wait, the options E and H are about supply and price.

Wait, the options E and H are about supply changes.

Option E: supply rises, price down, quantity up. → This would happen if supply increases, but substitution effect leads to lower demand.

Option H: supply falls, price up, quantity down. → This would happen if supply decreases (due to higher costs) and demand increases.

Wait, but substitution effect says demand decreases. So, if supply decreases, demand decreases too. So, what happens is both price and quantity decrease.

But the options don't have an option that says demand falls, price falls, quantity falls.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: The substitution effect leads to lower demand. So, the demand curve shifts left, leading to lower equilibrium price and lower quantity.

Looking for which option shows that. Looking at the options:

Which option shows demand decreasing?

Looking through the options, none of them exactly match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options.

Wait, let me check again. The options are:

A: supply falls, price up, quantity up.

B: demand rises, quantity up.

C: demand rises, quantity down.

D: demand falls, quantity up.

E: supply rises, price down, quantity up.

F: demand rises, quantity up.

G: supply rises, price up, quantity down.

H: supply falls, price up, quantity down.

I: demand falls, quantity down.

J: supply falls, price down, quantity down.

Wait, so if the substitution effect leads to lower demand, which is option D ( demand falls, quantity up) doesn't fit. Option I ( demand falls, quantity down) is also not present.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the substitution effect correctly. So the substitution effect leads to lower demand, so the correct option would be that demand falls, price falls, quantity falls. But looking at all the options, none of them have this. So perhaps the correct answer is that the demand falls, and the price falls, but the quantity falls. So, which option is that?

Looking again, none of the options match this. So perhaps this question is incorrect or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but that's not correct. Or perhaps I made a mistake in substitution effect.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substitution effect is that when the price of a substitute increases, the demand for the original decreases. So, demand curve shifts left, leading to lower equilibrium price and quantity.

But in the options, the only option that suggests demand is falling is option D and option I. But D says quantity increases, while I says quantity decreases.

Wait, option I says demand falls, quantity decreases. That's correct if the substitution effect is the main cause.

So, the correct option would be option I: demand falls, quantity decreases. But looking at the options, option I is present.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. The substitution effect is substitution effect, which leads to lower demand; the supply effect could be the opposite. Wait, but the question is about the market for denim jeans. So, perhaps the supply curve is not affected because the question doesn't mention any change in production costs or anything. So, only the substitution effect applies, which leads to lower demand.

So, the correct option is the one where demand falls and quantity decreases. Looking at the options, that's option I.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option I is 'Demand falls, quantity down.' So, option I would be correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option G was ' supply rises, price up, quantity down.' But that's incorrect because substitution effect is the main cause.

So, if the correct answer is option I, which says demand falls and quantity down.

But looking at all the options, option I is the only one that correctly reflects the substitution effect.

Wait, but wait, in the options, option F says demand rises, which is the opposite.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F. No, that's not it. So, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the question again: the market for jeans is in equilibrium, and the price of polyester pants (a substitute) rises. So, how does that affect the demand for jeans.

Substitution effect: higher price of substitute → more demand for original → so, the demand for jeans decreases.

Thus, the demand curve shifts left. Equilibrium price goes down, quantity goes down.

Looking for an option that says that.

The options are:

I: demand falls, quantity down.

So, the correct option is I.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option I says ' demand falls, quantity down.'

So, that's correct. So, the correct answer is option I. But looking back, the options don't have option I as one of the choices.

Wait, no, the options listed are:

A: supply falls, price up, quantity up.

B: demand rises, quantity up.

C: demand rises, quantity down.

D: demand falls, quantity up.

E: supply rises, price down, quantity up.

F: demand rises, quantity up.

G: supply rises, price up, quantity down.

H: supply falls, price up, quantity down.

I: demand falls, quantity down.

J: supply falls, price down, quantity down.

So, option I is ' demand falls, quantity down.' So, that's correct.

But wait, the question is about the substitution effect leading to lower quantity. So, the correct option is I.
</think>

The market for denim jeans is in equilibrium, meaning that the supply and demand curves intersect at a specific price and quantity. The question introduces a scenario where the price of polyester pants (a substitute good) rises. To analyze the impact, we consider the substitution effect and the supply effect.

### Substitution Effect:
- When the price of a substitute good increases, the demand for the original good decreases because people are more likely to buy the substitute. This is the substitution effect.
- As a result, the demand curve for denim jeans shifts to the left.

### Supply Effect:
- The supply effect refers to how a change in the price of a substitute good affects production. If the substitute becomes more expensive, the cost of producing the original good (denim jeans) increases, leading to a decrease in supply.
- However, the question does not mention any changes in production costs, so we assume the supply curve remains unchanged.

### Equilibrium Impact:
- The substitution effect causes the demand for denim jeans to decrease, leading to a new equilibrium where the price falls and the quantity falls.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A, B, C, D, E, G, J, K**: None of these options correctly reflect the substitution effect or the resulting changes in price and quantity.
- **F**: Incorrect, as it suggests demand increases.
- **H**: Incorrect, as it suggests supply increases.
- **I**: Correct. It states that demand falls and quantity decreases, which aligns with the substitution effect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **I: Demand falls, quantity down**. This correctly reflects the substitution effect, which leads to a decrease in demand and quantity in the denim jeans market.
