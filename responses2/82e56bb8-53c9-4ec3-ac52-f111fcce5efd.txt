Question:

A surgeon performed an appendectomy on a patient in an operating room at the local hospital. The surgeon was assisted by a nurse who was assigned to the operation by the hospital. During the patient's early convalescence, he complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the surgeon, who had bandaged him following the operation, had done so in such a manner as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the surgeon for malpractice, claiming $25,000 in damages. In his case-in-chief, the patient called the nurse to testifS' that shortly after the surgery, she saw the surgeon destroy the postoperative x-rays of the patient's abdomen. Upon objection by the surgeon's attorney, the trial judge should rule the nurse's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, but only if the surgeon is given an opportunity to refute the nurse's testimony.
B: inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
C: inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.
D: admissible, if the patient can demonstrate that the destroyed x-rays would have supported his claim.
E: admissible, but leave the weight of the nurse's testimony to be determined by the jury.
F: inadmissible, as the x-rays were destroyed post-operation and do not pertain to the surgeon's performance during the surgery.
G: inadmissible, unless other evidence can corroborate the nurse's testimony.
H: admissible, only if the nurse can prove that the surgeon intentionally destroyed the x-rays.
I: inadmissible, because the nurse's testimony is hearsay.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let's break it down step by step. 

So, the scenario is a patient who had an appendectomy. The surgeon was assisted by a nurse who was assigned to the operation by the hospital. After the surgery, the nurse bandaged the patient, which caused some acute pain. That pain was beyond what's considered a normal post-operative symptom, so the patient sued the surgeon for malpractice, claiming $25k.

The key point here is about the nurse's testimony. The patient called the nurse shortly after the surgery, and she saw the surgeon destroy the postoperative x-rays. The question is about whether this testimony is admissible.

From what I remember about hearsay, a hearsay claim is an out-of-court statement that has personal knowledge or belief and can be used to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the x-rays were taken during the surgery, and the patient's attorney is objecting to the testimony. Wait, but the patient is calling the nurse, who was assigned to the operation. 

Wait, the x-rays were taken post-surgery, so they were not part of the surgery. The patient's attorney is objecting to the testimony of the nurse about the x-rays, implying that the x-rays were destroyed after the surgery. But wait, the x-rays were taken, but the patient (or the nurse) is seeing them. Is that extrinsic evidence? Or is it intrinsic?

Wait, extrinsic evidence is something that arises from an event and is not directly part of that event. So, if the x-rays were taken during surgery, and the patient saw them after, that's extrinsic. But if the patient saw the x-rays during the operation, that's intrinsic.

Wait, the patient called the nurse after the surgery. So, when the x-rays were taken, the surgical team was probably done, and the x-ray was taken to check the site of the wound. Then, after the surgery, the patient comes to call the nurse and sees that the x-ray was destroyed. So, the x-rays were not part of the surgery; they were taken after. So, the patient is seeing them after, making it extrinsic evidence.

But wait, I'm a little confused. Let me think again. The x-rays were taken during the surgery, but the patient is calling the nurse after. So, the x-rays were used to check the site during the surgery, and then the patient comes to see the nurse. So, the x-ray was part of the patient's observation, not an event during the surgery. So, the patient is seeing the x-rays post-surgery, which makes it extrinsic.

Wait, but the patient is calling the nurse after the surgery, so the x-rays were taken, the patient saw them post-surgery. So, the x-rays are not part of the surgery. Thus, the patient is using the x-ray destruction as extrinsic evidence. But wait, is that a hearsay issue?

Wait, the question is about whether the patient's testimony is admissible. The patient is calling the nurse to testify about the destruction of the x-rays. The issue is whether that testimony is hearsay.

Wait, the x-rays were taken during the surgery, but the patient is calling the nurse after. So, the destruction of the x-rays is an event that occurred after the surgery. The patient's testimony is about an extrinsic event. But is that extrinsic evidence?

Wait, extrinsic evidence is something that arises from an event and is not directly part of it. So, if the x-rays were taken while the surgery was ongoing, they were part of the event. But if they were taken after the surgery, the x-rays were not part of the surgery, so the destruction after the surgery would be an event outside the surgery. So, the destruction is a collateral matter, but does that make it extrinsic? Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Another angle: the x-rays were taken during the surgery. So, the patient was already aware of the x-rays being taken when he called the nurse. But the destruction happened after the surgery. So, the patient is using the destruction as an event that occurred after the surgery, making it extrinsic.

Wait, but then the destruction is an event that happened after the surgery. The patient is using it to claim that the surgeon caused the patient's injury. So, the destruction of the x-rays is a collateral matter, but is it extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter?

Wait, I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about hearsay. A hearsay claim must meet three criteria: (1) the statement is out of court; (2) there is personal knowledge or belief; (3) the statement is for the truth of the matter asserted.

So, the patient is trying to say that the destruction of x-rays was caused by the surgeon, leading to the patient's injury. The destruction is an extrinsic event. But the patient is calling the nurse to testify about it. So, the witness is the nurse, and the statement is about the destruction of the x-rays.

Is the destruction of the x-rays an out-of-court statement? Well, the patient was called to testify about it, so the statement isn't out of court. Wait, but the patient is calling the nurse, so the statement is hearsay. So, hearsay applies.

Wait, but the destruction of the x-rays was a part of the patient's observation, not an event in the surgery. So, the destruction is an extrinsic event, but was it at the time of the surgery? No, it was after. So, the destruction is an extrinsic collateral matter. But since the destruction happened after the surgery, does that make it extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter? Or is it an extrinsic event outside the surgery.

Wait, perhaps the destruction is part of an extrinsic event, but it's not part of the surgery. So, the destruction is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter. But as far as hearsay, the destruction is not hearsay because the patient is calling the nurse, not the patient making an out-of-court statement.

Wait, no, the patient is calling the nurse. The statement is the nurse's testimony about the destruction. So, is the destruction hearsay? Because it's a statement made by someone (the nurse) about something that happened after the surgery. So, is the destruction hearsay?

Wait, the destruction was a fact known after the surgery. But the patient is calling the nurse to testify about it. So, the statement is hearsay because the patient is calling the witness, not the witness itself making a statement.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For hearsay, the statement must be made by a person other than the party being sued. In this case, the patient is calling the witness. So, the statement is hearsay. Therefore, the destruction is hearsay and thus inadmissible.

But wait, the destruction was of the x-rays taken during the surgery. So, the patient was aware of the x-rays being taken when he called the nurse. However, the destruction happened after the surgery. So, is the destruction extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter?

Wait, I'm not sure. So, the issue is whether the destruction is extrinsic. If the destruction was of something taken during the surgery, then it's intrinsic. If it's something taken after, then it's extrinsic.

The patient is trying to claim that the surgeon caused the patient's injury. The x-rays were taken during the surgery, but the destruction happened after. So, the destruction is an extrinsic event. But wait, the destruction was not part of the surgery—so the destruction is an extrinsic collateral matter.

Wait, but the destruction is an event that occurred after the surgery. So, the destruction is an extrinsic event, but it's not part of the surgery. So, the destruction is an extrinsic collateral matter. But for hearsay, the destruction must be an event that occurred during the performance of the act. So, the destruction of the x-rays was not during the surgery, but after. Therefore, the destruction is an extrinsic collateral matter.

Wait, but the destruction is part of an event that happened after the surgery. So, if the destruction was an extrinsic event, then it's not hearsay because it's not a matter of the court's fact. But wait, the destruction was happening after the surgery, so it's an extrinsic matter, but it's not part of the surgical procedure. So, the destruction is part of an event that happened after the surgery, making it an extrinsic collateral matter.

But if the destruction was a collateral matter, then it's admissible. However, the destruction is not a hearsay because it's not a matter the patient's attorney is asserting. Wait, no—the patient is calling the witness to testify about it. So, the statement is hearsay because the witness is making a statement about something that happened after the surgery.

Wait, but perhaps the destruction was part of an extrinsic event that happened after the surgery, so it's not hearsay. So, the destruction is an extrinsic event, and thus, the statement is not hearsay because it's an extrinsic matter. But wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the destruction is not a hearsay because the patient is calling the witness, not the witness making the statement. So, the destruction is hearsay because the witness is making a statement.

Wait, but wait, the patient is calling the witness to testify about the destruction. So, that's hearsay. Therefore, the destruction is hearsay and can't be used to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the testimony would be inadmissible.

But wait, another angle: the x-rays were taken after the surgery, so the destruction is an extrinsic event. But was the destruction a collateral matter? If the destruction was a collateral matter, then it's admissible. But the destruction is not part of the surgery; it's after. So, it's an extrinsic matter, but not a collateral matter.

Wait, maybe the destruction of the x-rays is not a matter that the patient needs to prove the truth of. So, the statement is hearsay and thus inadmissible.

Wait, but the patient is calling the witness. So, the statement is hearsay because it's being made by a third party (the witness). Therefore, the destruction is hearsay and thus cannot be used to prove what the patient is claiming about the patient's claim.

Wait, but the patient is suing for malpractice, and the x-rays destruction is a collateral matter. If the destruction is a collateral matter, then the statement is admissible. But the destruction was after the surgery, so it's an extrinsic matter.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think I'm getting confused about whether the destruction is a collateral matter. If it's a collateral matter, then the statement is admissible. But if it's not, then it's extrinsic and inadmissible.

Wait, the question is whether the destruction is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter. So, if the destruction is an extrinsic collateral matter, then it's admissible. If not, it's not.

In this case, the destruction was after the surgery. So, the destruction is an extrinsic matter. But is it a collateral matter? Collateral matters are those that are not part of the performance of the act. The x-rays were taken during the surgery, so the destruction after is an extrinsic matter but not part of the surgery. So, it's an extrinsic collateral matter.

Wait, but the destruction of the x-rays is a collateral matter because it's something taken after the surgery. So, it's an extrinsic matter. But is it a collateral matter? Because it's not part of the surgery. So, it's an extrinsic collateral matter.

Wait, but the destruction was not during the surgery, so it's an extrinsic matter. The statement is hearsay because the witness is making it. So, it's inadmissible.

But wait, the patient is calling the witness, so that's hearsay. Thus, the statement is hearsay and is therefore inadmissible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, option B says it's inadmissible because of the danger of unfair prejudice. But that's more about the credibility of the statement, not necessarily hearsay.

Option G says it's inadmissible unless other evidence can corroborate. But the patient is calling the witness, which is hearsay but not necessarily inadmissible.

Option A says it's admissible only if the surgeon can refute. Wait, no—hearsay doesn't require the witness to be given a chance to refute. The standard is that the statement is hearsay, meaning it's a statement made by someone other than the parties involved, and not directly part of the event.

So, the statement is hearsay because it's made by a third party (the witness). So, the destruction is hearsay and thus inadmissible.

Wait, but the patient is calling the witness, so that's hearsay. So, the destruction is hearsay, so the testimony is inadmissible.

So, looking at the options: option B is about probative value and danger of unfair prejudice. Option G is about other evidence.

Wait, the question is about whether the destruction is hearsay. Because the patient is calling the witness, the statement is hearsay. So, the testimony is inadmissible. So, the correct answer would be B or A.

Option A says it's admissible only if the surgeon is given an opportunity to refute the testimony. But that's not the case. If the statement is hearsay, the witness doesn't need to be given a chance to refute.

Option B says it's inadmissible because the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Again, that's about the credibility, not hearsay.

Option C: inadmissible because extrinsic. Hmm, extrinsic evidence is not hearsay. So, that's incorrect.

Option D: admissible if the patient can demonstrate the x-rays were destroyed to prove the injury. But the patient is calling the witness, so the destruction is hearsay, so that's not enough.

Option E: admissible with the jury to leave it to them. But hearsay can't be admissible without the witness.

Option F: inadmissible as extrinsic. No, because the destruction is an extrinsic matter but not a collateral matter.

Option G: inadmissible unless other evidence. But the patient is calling the witness, which is hearsay. So, unless the witness can be proven, it's inadmissible.

Option H: admissible only if the witness intentionally destroyed. That's about the content, not hearsay.

So, the correct answer must be about hearsay. So, looking at the options, option B is about the probative value and unfair prejudice. Option A is about the opportunity to refute. Neither is about hearsay.

Wait, the issue is that the statement is hearsay. So, the destruction is hearsay, so the testimony is inadmissible. So, which option says that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay?

Looking at the options:

Option A: admissible only if the surgeon is given an opportunity to refute.

No, because hearsay doesn't require the witness to refute.

Option B: inadmissible because of probative value and unfair prejudice.

No, that's about credibility.

Option C: extrinsic, so not hearsay. So, no.

Option D: if the patient can prove the destruction, but the witness is making a hearsay statement.

Option E: admissible with the jury's decision. No, hearsay can't be admissible.

Option F: extrinsic, but destruction is not extrinsic.

Option G: inadmissible unless other evidence. So, if the destruction is a collateral matter, it's admissible.

But in this case, the destruction is after the surgery, so it's an extrinsic matter. So, not a collateral matter. So, the destruction is an extrinsic matter but not collateral.

Wait, but the destruction is an extrinsic matter, so it's not a collateral matter. Therefore, the destruction is not hearsay, so the testimony is admissible.

Wait, but the destruction was a collateral matter, but it's not part of the surgery. So, the destruction was after, making it extrinsic.

Wait, maybe the destruction is a collateral matter because it's part of the patient's recovery. But I'm not certain about that. 

Alternatively, the fact that the destruction is an event after the surgery doesn't make it extrinsic. So, the destruction is an extrinsic matter, but not a collateral matter. So, the destruction is an event outside the surgical procedure. Therefore, it's an extrinsic matter, but not a collateral matter, so it's admissible.

Wait, but if the destruction is an extrinsic matter, then it's not hearsay. So, the statement is hearsay only if it's made by a third party. In this case, the destruction is being made by the patient's attorney. So, the statement is hearsay. So, the destruction is hearsay, making the testimony inadmissible.

Wait, but the patient is calling the witness, so it's hearsay. So, the destruction is hearsay and can't be used to prove the patient's claim. Therefore, the testimony is inadmissible.

Looking at the options, none directly address this except for option B and G.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on this. Let's try to go back to the basics. A hearsay statement is an out-of-court statement that is for the truth of the matter asserted. So, for it to be hearsay, it must be made by a third party (not the parties involved in the event), and the statement is for the truth of the matter asserted.

In this case, the destruction was made by the patient's attorney. So, it's a hearsay statement.

Therefore, the destruction is hearsay, making the testimony inadmissible.

Looking at the options, the correct answer should be one that says the destruction is inadmissible because of hearsay. None of the options directly state that, but option B and G are related.

Hmm, perhaps option B is about the probative value and the danger of unfair prejudice. But that's about the witness's credibility, not hearsay.

Wait, another thought: the patient is calling the witness, so that's hearsay. Therefore, the destruction is inadmissible. So, the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the options are:

A: admissible only if the surgeon refutes.

B: inadmissible due to probative value and danger.

C: extrinsic, so out of hearsay.

D: admissible if the patient can demonstrate x-rays caused.

E: admissible with jury.

F: extrinsic, but not collateral.

G: inadmissible unless other evidence.

H: admissible only if witness intentionally destroys.

So, the correct answer is about hearsay. So, the destruction is hearsay, making the testimony inadmissible.

So, looking at the options, none is about hearsay. So, perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the destruction is not hearsay because it's an extrinsic matter that's not a collateral matter. So, the destruction is not a hearsay statement, making the testimony admissible.

Wait, I'm really confused. Let me think about this again.

The patient is calling the witness, making a hearsay statement. So, the destruction is hearsay, and thus, the testimony is inadmissible.

But I'm not sure which option says that. Looking at the options, option B is about the probative value and the danger of unfair prejudice. So, that's about the witness's credibility, not about hearsay.

Option G is about the statement being admissible unless other evidence supports it. So, if the destruction was a collateral matter, then it's admissible. But in this case, the destruction is an extrinsic matter, so it's not a collateral matter. Wait, but the destruction was after the surgery, so it's an extrinsic matter, but not a collateral matter because it's not part of the surgical procedure.

Wait, the patient is calling the witness, so the destruction is hearsay. So, the testimony is inadmissible.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about what each option says:

Option B: inadmissible because probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

But that's about the witness's credibility, not hearsay.

Option G: inadmissible unless other evidence can corroborate.

So, if the destruction was a collateral matter, then it's admissible. But in this case, the destruction is after the surgery, so it's an extrinsic matter, not a collateral matter. Wait, perhaps the destruction was a collateral matter because it's something that occurred after the surgery. So, it's an extrinsic matter, but not a collateral matter.

Wait, but the fact that the destruction was a collateral matter would make it admissible. But this is getting too complicated.

I think the correct answer is option B: inadmissible because of the danger of unfair prejudice.

Wait, no, that's about the witness's credibility, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the patient is right, and the destruction is hearsay, so the testimony is inadmissible.

Looking back at the options, none directly address this, except for option B and G.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option B, because the patient is calling the witness, which is hearsay, but the destruction is an extrinsic matter, making it inadmissible.

So, the correct answer is option B: inadmissible because the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, which says it's inadmissible unless other evidence can corroborate.

Wait, but the destruction was a collateral matter because it's something the patient can prove. So, the destruction was a collateral matter, making it admissible.

But in this case, the destruction was after the surgery, so it's an extrinsic matter, not a collateral matter. Wait, perhaps the patient is right, and the destruction is an extrinsic matter, making it not hearsay, so the testimony is admissible.

Thus, the correct answer is option G, because the destruction is a collateral matter, making it admissible.

Wait, but this is getting too confusing. I think I should conclude that the destruction is hearsay, making the testimony inadmissible, so the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, because the destruction is a collateral matter, making it admissible. But I'm not certain.

I think I've to make a choice. Since the destruction is hearsay, the testimony is inadmissible, so the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, because the destruction is a collateral matter, making it admissible.

I think the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure because I'm confusing hearsay with other issues.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The patient is calling the witness, making a hearsay statement. So, the destruction is hearsay, making the testimony inadmissible. So, the correct answer is option B.

Wait, no, because option B is about the probative value and the danger of unfair prejudice, not about hearsay.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to go with option B, but I'm not sure.
</think>

The patient is calling the witness, making a hearsay statement about the destruction of the x-rays taken after the surgery. Hearsay requires the statement to be made by a third party, not directly part of the event. Since the destruction is hearsay, the testimony is inadmissible. 

ANSWER: B
