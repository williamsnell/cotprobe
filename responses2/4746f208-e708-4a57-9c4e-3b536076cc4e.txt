Okay, so I have this problem here about a sequence and I need to find its limit. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The sequence is defined by x₁ = 2, and then each next term is given by x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/(1 + x_n). The question says that if the sequence converges, what must its limit be in decimals. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that if a sequence converges, the limit should satisfy a certain equation derived from the recursive formula. Let me try to set up that equation.

Let's assume that the sequence converges to some limit L. Then, as n approaches infinity, both x_n and x_{n+1} approach L. So, substituting L into the recursive formula should give me an equation to solve.

So, substituting, I get L = 1 + 1/(1 + L). Wait, let me write that correctly:

L = 1 + 1/(1 + L)

Hmm, that seems right. Now, I need to solve for L. Let's do the math.

First, let me rewrite the equation:

L = 1 + 1/(1 + L)

Let me subtract 1 from both sides to simplify:

L - 1 = 1/(1 + L)

Now, to eliminate the denominator, I can multiply both sides by (1 + L):

(L - 1)(1 + L) = 1

Expanding the left side:

(L)(1) + L(L) - 1(1) -1(L) = 1

Simplify term by term:

L + L² -1 - L = 1

Wait, let's do that again. Multiplying (L -1)(1 + L):

= L*(1) + L*(L) -1*(1) -1*(L)
= L + L² -1 - L

Wait, that's L + L² -1 - L. The L and -L cancel out, so you're left with L² -1 = 1.

So, L² - 1 = 1.

Then, add 1 to both sides:

L² = 2

Taking the square root of both sides, so L could be sqrt(2) or -sqrt(2). Since our sequence starts at 2 and each term is 1 + something positive, all terms are positive. So, the limit must be positive. So, L = sqrt(2).

Wait, but what is sqrt(2) approximately? I remember that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142... So, looking at the options, option B is 1.414, which is that value rounded to three decimal places.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the recursive formula:

x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/(1 + x_n)

Assuming x_n approaches L, then x_{n+1} approaches L as well. So, substituting L:

L = 1 + 1/(1 + L)

Then, subtract 1:

L - 1 = 1/(1 + L)

Multiply both sides by (1 + L):

(L - 1)(1 + L) = 1

Expanding left side:

L*(1) + L*(L) -1*(1) -1*(L) = L + L² -1 - L.

The L and -L cancel, leaving L² -1 = 1.

So, L² = 2 → L = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142.

Yes, that all makes sense. So the limit is sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414, matching option B.

Wait, but what about the other options? Are there any other possibilities? For example, if the sequence is converging, would it be positive or negative? Given that x₁ is 2, and each term is 1 + 1/(something positive), so all terms are positive. So the limit can't be negative, so it must be positive sqrt(2).

Looking again at the options, option B is 1.414, which is the correct approximate value. So, the answer should be B.
</think>

The sequence is defined recursively and converges to a limit L. By substituting L into the recursive formula, we derive the equation L = 1 + 1/(1 + L). Solving this, we find L = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
