Okay, so I have this economics question here about how an expansionary monetary policy affects different economies. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about two economies: Economy X is an open economy with flexible exchange rates, and Economy Y is closed. The question is asking what happens to the effectiveness of an expansionary monetary policy in each, given that all else is equal.

So, what's an expansionary monetary policy? I remember it's when the central bank increases the money supply, which leads to higher interest rates. This typically reduces private savings because people have more money to spend, leading to a higher demand for goods, which causes inflation. But how does this affect net exports and net income for each economy?

Starting with Economy X, which is open and has flexible exchange rates. Open economies trade with other countries. In such a scenario, higher interest rates would attract foreign capital. Because the domestic currency is stronger, foreign consumers might want to buy more of the domestic good, increasing net exports. So, higher interest rates would make domestic goods more attractive to foreign buyers, boosting exports. That would increase net income for domestic firms because they export more. Also, flexible exchange rates let the currency adjust, so the effect on net exports is more pronounced. So, expansionary money policy in X would have a bigger impact on net exports than in Y.

Now, Economy Y is closed. That means there's no trade with other countries. So, if the central bank increases the money supply, the higher interest rates would encourage saving and investment, leading to higher private savings and investment. But since there's no other country to buy the goods from, net exports would be zero. So, the expansionary policy in Y would have no effect on net exports because exports can't increase. Thus, net income for domestic firms wouldn't go up since they can't export more.

Looking at the options:

Option A: More effective in X because the policy increases net exports. That makes sense because X's flexible exchange rates allow net exports to rise. So A is a likely correct answer.

Option B: X more effective because it decreases net exports. No, because higher money supply in X leads to higher interest rates, which should attract more exports, not decrease. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Equally effective. No, because Y can't respond as much. So C is wrong.

Option D: Less effective in X because it decreases net exports. No, because in X, net exports would increase, so D is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. An expansionary monetary policy in Economy X, which is an open economy with flexible exchange rates, is more effective because it increases net exports. Higher interest rates attract foreign capital, leading to a stronger domestic currency and increased demand for domestic goods from foreign consumers. This boosts net income for domestic firms and net exports. In contrast, Economy Y, being closed, cannot respond to the policy and thus has no effect on net exports.

Answer: A
