Okay, so I've got this problem here about polynomials and their degrees. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says that f(x) is a degree 6 polynomial, g(x) is degree 3, and h(x) is some polynomial we're trying to find the degree of. The expression given is f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)), and it's stated that this sum is a polynomial of degree 36. So, I need to find the degree of h(x).

Hmm, I remember that when you compose two polynomials, the degree of the composition is the product of their degrees. For example, if f is degree m and g is degree n, then f(g(x)) is degree m*n. So, let's apply this to each term in the given expression.

First term: f(g(x)). Since f is degree 6 and g is degree 3, f(g(x)) would have degree 6*3 = 18.

Second term: g(h(x)). Similarly, g is degree 3, so regardless of what h is, the degree here is 3 times the degree of h. Let's denote the degree of h as d. So this term contributes a degree of 3*d.

Third term: h(f(x)). Here, h is the outer polynomial, and f is the inner one. So, the degree would be d*6, since f is degree 6. So this term contributes a degree of 6*d.

Now, the entire expression is a sum of these three terms: f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)). The degree of the sum will be the highest degree among these individual terms. So, the degree of the sum is the maximum of the degrees of f(g(x)), g(h(x)), and h(f(x)).

We know the sum has degree 36. So, let's set up the equation:

max(18, 3*d, 6*d) = 36.

So, we need to find d such that the maximum of these three is 36.

Let's analyze each possible maximum:

1. If 3*d = 36, then d would be 12. But we also have to check if 6*d is 72, which is higher than 36, so that can't be.

Wait, let me think again. Actually, each of these terms contributes their own degree. So, the maximum of 18, 3d, and 6d must be 36.

So, we can set each term equal to 36 and see which one gives a possible d.

First, 18 is definitely less than 36, so that's not the maximum. Next, 3d = 36 implies d=12. Let's check if 6d is 72, which is higher than 36, so that can't be. So, if d=12, then 3d=36 and 6d=72. So the maximum would be 72, which is higher than 36. Therefore, d cannot be 12 because the sum's degree would be 72, which is more than given.

Next, let's check if 6d=36. That would imply d=6. Then, what are the other terms? 3d=18 and 6d=36. So the maximum would be 36, which matches the given degree. So, h(x) could have degree 6.

Wait, but what if I check the other possibility where 3d=36. Then d=12, but then 6d=72, which is higher than 36, so that wouldn't work. So the only possible case is d=6, which makes 6d=36, and 3d=18, so 36 is the maximum. So h(x) must have degree 6.

So the correct answer is C:6.

The composition of the polynomials leads to degrees of 18, 3d, and 6d. The maximum degree must be 36, so setting 6d = 36 gives d = 6. This is the degree of h(x). 

Answer: C
