Question:

WQLP radio station just purchased a stereo system for $8,400. It has an estimated life of 6 years and a residual value of $1,200. Due to the fast wear of needles, there is an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. Find the total amount the stereo system depreciated in the first year using the straight-line basis.

Options:

A: $2,600
B: $2,040
C: $1,440
D: $3,360
E: $5,520
F: $1,680
G: $1,020
H: $3,000
I: $1,200
J: $920

Okay, so I have this problem about depreciation for a stereo system. Hmm, let me see. The question is about figuring out how much the stereo system depreciated in the first year using the straight-line basis. Oh right, straight-line depreciation is when you spread the cost evenly over the useful life.

Wait, but the problem says there's an additional 20% depreciation in the first year due to things like needles. Oh, so maybe the 20% is on top of the straight-line calculation? Or is it part of the straight-line calculation? I'm a bit confused.

Let me think. The straight-line depreciation method calculates the depreciation expense by dividing the depreciable amount by the useful life. The depreciable amount is the cost minus the residual value. So the first step is to calculate the straight-line depreciation and then apply the additional 20%.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the stereo station just purchased it for $8,400. The estimated life is 6 years, and the residual value is $1,200. So the depreciable amount would be $8,400 minus $1,200. Let me do that: 8400 - 1200 = 7200. So the total depreciable cost is $7,200.

Then, straight-line depreciation per year would be $7,200 divided by 6 years, which is $1,200 per year. But wait, the problem says there's an additional 20% in the first year. Oh, right, because of the needle wear. So the first-year depreciation is the straight-line plus 20% of the straight-line amount.

Wait, no, no. Let me clarify. The straight-line method is the standard way. But in reality, sometimes companies apply accelerated depreciation methods. But the question says to use the straight-line basis. Oh wait, the question says to find the total amount the system depreciated in the first year using the straight-line basis. So maybe the straight-line depreciation is what's being calculated, and then the 20% is an additional factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the first-year depreciation is calculated using straight-line, and then they add 20% of that first-year depreciation. Or maybe the 20% is applied to the straight-line basis.

Wait, the question says: "additional 20% depreciation in the first year." So perhaps that 20% is on top of the straight-line method. Or maybe it's part of the total method.

Wait, no, perhaps the straight-line is the base, and then 20% is added to that? Let me think. So, the straight-line depreciation per year is (Cost - Residual)/Life. So that's (8400-1200)/6 = 7200/6= 1200. So per year it's $1,200. But the problem says an additional 20% is applied in the first year. So perhaps the total depreciation in the first year is 1,200 plus 20% of 1,200.

Wait, but 20% of 1,200 is $240, so adding that would make the total depreciation $1,440.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the additional 20% depreciation in the first year." So perhaps the 20% is on the straight-line basis, meaning that the first-year depreciation is 20% higher than the straight-line? Or is it adding on top of the straight-line?

I'm a bit confused, but I think the way it's phrased is that the first-year depreciation is 20% higher than what the straight-line would be. Or maybe it's that the depreciation for the first year is 20% of the total line, and the line is the base.

Wait, let's think about it again. The straight-line method is a type of depreciation. For the first year, the straight-line would be (Cost - Residual)/Life. So that's 7200/6=1200.

But the problem says there's an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. So perhaps the first-year depreciation is 1200 plus 20% of 1200. Which is 1200 * 0.2 = 240, so 1200 +240=1440. So total depreciation is $1,440.

Looking at the options, option C is $1,440. That seems to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the additional 20% is applied in the first year beyond the straight line, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to interpret it is that the total depreciation is 20% higher than the straight-line method. So 1200 * 1.2 = 1440.

Alternatively, perhaps the straight-line is the base, and 20% is an accelerated method. But I think the question is that the first year's depreciation is 20% higher than the straight-line rate.

Wait, no, the question says the additional 20% is applied in the first year. So it's the same as adding 20% on the straight-line to get the first-year depreciation. Let's compute that again.

The straight-line is 1200. Adding 20% of that to 1200 gives 1200*(1.2) = 1440. So the total depreciation for the first year is $1,440, which is option C.

The stereo system's cost is $8,400, with a residual value of $1,200 and an estimated life of 6 years. The straight-line depreciation per year is calculated as:

\[
\text{Depreciable amount} = \$8,400 - \$1,200 = \$7,200
\]
\[
\text{Depreciation per year} = \frac{\$7,200}{6} = \$1,200
\]

The problem states an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. This is calculated as:

\[
\text{Additional 20\% of straight-line} = \$1,200 \times 0.20 = \$240
\]

Adding this to the straight-line depreciation:

\[
\text{Total first-year depreciation} = \$1,200 + \$240 = \$1,440
\]

Thus, the total depreciation in the first year is $1,440, which corresponds to option C.
