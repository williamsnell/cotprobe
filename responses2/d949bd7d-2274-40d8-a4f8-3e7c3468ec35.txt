Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about finding the voltage needed to send a current of 2 amperes through a bell circuit with a resistance of 3 ohms. Hmm, I remember something about Ohm's Law from my classes. Oh right, Ohm's Law is V = I * R, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

Wait, let's make sure I get this right. So, the current is 2 amperes, and the resistance is 3 ohms. So I just need to multiply those two numbers together to get the voltage. Let me calculate that: 2 times 3 is 6. So V should be 6 volts.

Looking at the options, option D is 6 volts. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check. Could I have confused the formula? Oh no, I don't think so. Ohm's Law is definitely V equals I times R. And sometimes I remember it as " volts equal amps multiplied by ohms." Yeah, that's right.

Another way to think about it: If the current is 2A, and the resistance is 3Î©, then each ohm of resistance will cause 2 volts. So 3 times 2 is 6 volts in total. Yep, that makes sense. I don't think I made a mistake here.

To determine the voltage required for a current of 2 amperes through a circuit with a resistance of 3 ohms, we use Ohm's Law: \( V = I \times R \). Calculating this gives \( V = 2 \, \text{A} \times 3 \, \Omega = 6 \, \text{V} \). The correct option is D: 6 volts.

Answer: D
