Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about World Systems Theory and the different categories of countries. The question is asking which option best describes semi-periphery countries. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall what World Systems Theory (WST) categorizes the world. From what I remember, WST divides the world into three main subcategories: core countries, periphery countries, and semi-periphery countries. Core countries are the largest, usually industrialized nations with advanced economies. Periphery countries are the next level, often developing nations at the edge of industrialization, maybe with some high-income countries. Semi-periphery countries would be those that are not core but aren't too far out either. They might be less developed than periphery countries but more developed than core.

So, looking at the options, the question is about what semi-periphery countries are like.

Option A: Small percentage of very high class individuals. Hmm, I'm not sure. High class usually refers to the elite. If it's a small percentage, maybe this is the core countries, not the semi-periphery. Or, wait, maybe high class might not be a good descriptor for semi-periphery.

Option B: Highly industrialized and technologically advanced nations. Well, that sounds like core countries. Because they're more developed and advanced, so probably not the semi-periphery.

Option C: Countries with a high rate of population growth. Population growth doesn't directly relate to the classification of countries. They could be in any category, but I'm not certain this is the best descriptor.

Option D: Strong central government. Central governments are part of core countries, so this doesn't fit.

Option E: High rates of urbanization. Urbanization affects the distribution of resources but I'm not sure how this ties into the system. It might contribute to semi-periphery countries, perhaps as they develop their economies, but I'm not certain.

Option F: Economies dependent on foreign aid. That sounds like periphery countries, since they might rely on foreign resources, while semi-periphery might be more self-sufficient.

Option G: Low income, agrarian societies. Low income and agrarian might fit core countries, which are the most developed and industrialized.

Option H: Countries with no natural resources. That's a broad category. Semi-peripheries could be those without natural resources but still have developed economies.

Option I: A diversified and developed economy. Diversified suggests they have multiple sectors, developed but maybe not as advanced as core. This could fit semi-peripheries, as they're developed but not as industrialized as core.

Option J: An economy centralized around one natural resource. That sounds like core countries, which are the strongest in the system.

So, putting it together, semi-periphery countries are probably those with a mix of factors. Not as industrialized as core, but not as rural as periphery. So, they should have a diversified economy but not as advanced. Looking at the options, option I is a diversified and developed economy. That seems like a good fit. Alternatively, option J, which is centralized around a natural resource, is core countries.

Wait, option J is about being centralized around a natural resource. Core countries are usually in industrialized nations, so that's more about one natural resource. Semi-peripheries are more about being developed but not as industrialized. So option I seems better.

Option F is periphery, so not semi. Option E, urbanization, might not be the primary factor. Option G is low income, which is more core.

So the best answer should be option I: A diversified and developed economy.

The correct answer is **I: A diversified and developed economy**. 

In World Systems Theory, semi-periphery countries are characterized as having a diversified and developed economy, neither as highly industrialized as core countries nor as reliant on foreign aid as periphery countries. This makes option I the best fit. 

Answer: I
