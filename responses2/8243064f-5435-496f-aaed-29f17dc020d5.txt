Okay, so I have this problem here about the average salary of Bedford Manufacturing Co. changing over a 10-year period. The question says that the average salary rose by 60% and that this increase was $42.50 a week. I need to find the average weekly salary at the beginning and the end of the period. 

Hmm, let me think. I remember that a 60% increase means the new salary is 160% of the original, right? Because 100% plus 60% is 160%. So if I let the original salary be some amount S, then after a 60% increase, it's S multiplied by 1.6.

But wait, the increase is given as $42.50 a week. So I think that means the amount that the salary went up each week is $42.50. But wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the average salary rose by 60% during the 10-year period. So the total increase is 60%, which comes from the $42.50 per week. 

Wait, perhaps the increase is 60% of the original salary. So the total increase is 0.6 * original = $42.50. Because if the original is S, then 60% of S is the increase. So 0.6S = $42.50. Then I can solve for S.

Let me write that down. 

0.6 * S = 42.50

So S = 42.50 / 0.6

Let me compute that. 42.50 divided by 0.6. Hmm, 0.6 goes into 42.50 how many times? 

Well, 0.6 * 70 is 42, which is 70, so 42.50 is 70 plus 0.50. Oh wait, 0.6 * 0.8333 is about 0.5. So 70 + 0.8333 = 70.8333. So S is approximately $70.83. So the starting salary was $70.83 per week.

Now, the ending salary would be the original plus the increase, so 70.83 + 42.50 = 113.33. So the end salary is $113.33.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The question says the average rose by 60% during the 10-year period, and this amount was $42.50 a week. So does that mean each week the salary went up by $42.50, leading to an overall 60% increase? Or is it that the total increase is $42.50 over the 10 years?

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, "the average rose 60% during a 10-year period. This rise amounted to $42.50 a week." So the 60% increase is the total amount the salary increased, which is $42.50 per week. So the total increase over 10 years is 60% of the original salary, and that's $42.50 per week. Wait, no, because if the increase is 60% over the 10 years, that's 60% of the original. So the total increase is 60% of S. But the increase each week is $42.50. So perhaps the 60% is per week?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me parse the question again. The average salary rose 60% during a 10-year period. This rise amounted to $42.50 a week. So the total increase is 60% of the original, which is $42.50 a week. That can't be right because 60% of the original is a one-time increase. Wait, no, the 60% is the total increase over the 10 years. So 60% of the original is the total increase, and that's $42.50 per week? That doesn't make sense. Because 60% of S is the total increase, which is the amount that the salary increased over the period. So the total increase is $42.50 * 10 years. Wait, because the increase is per week.

Wait no, that's not correct. Let me think again. If the increase is 60%, then the total increase over the 10 years is 60% of the original salary, which is $42.50 per week. No, that's not correct either. Because if the increase is 60% over the 10 years, the increase is 60% of S, which is the total increase. But the question says the increase was $42.50 a week. So perhaps the increase per week is $42.50, leading to a total increase over 10 years. Or perhaps the 60% is the total increase, which is $42.50 per year or something.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently. Maybe the 60% is the total percentage increase over the 10 years. So the increase is 60% of the original salary. So if the original salary is S, the increase is 0.6*S, and that's the total increase. Since the increase is $42.50 a week, but wait, over 10 years, that's 10 years multiplied by 52 weeks, so 520 weeks. So the total increase would be $42.50 * 520 weeks.

Wait, that seems really high. Let me check. 520 weeks is 10 years. So the total increase is 42.50 * 520. Let me compute that. 42.50 * 500 is 21,250, and 42.50 * 20 is 850, so total increase is 22,100.

So 0.6 * S = 22,100.

Then, S = 22,100 / 0.6 = 36,833.33.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the original salary is $36,833.33, then a 60% increase would be 0.6 * 36,833.33 = 22,100, which is the total increase over 10 years. But the question says the increase was $42.50 a week. Hmm, this seems way too high.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me re-read it. The average rose 60% during the 10-year period. This rise amounted to $42.50 a week.

Wait, "this rise" could mean that the 60% increase was equal to $42.50 a week. So 60% increase is $42.50 per week.

Wait, no, that's not possible because 60% increase is a one-time thing, not per week. So perhaps the 60% increase is the total over 10 years, which is $42.50 per week. No, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, maybe the 60% increase is the total amount over 10 years, and that's $42.50 per week. No, no, that can't be. Because 60% of S is the total increase, which is 60% of S. So 0.6*S = total increase over 10 years.

Wait, but the problem states that the increase was $42.50 a week. So perhaps each week, the increase is $42.50, so over 10 years (which is 520 weeks), the total increase is 520 * 42.50.

Let me compute that: 520 * 42.50. Let's compute 520 * 40 = 20,800, and 520 * 2.50 = 1,300. So total increase is 22,100, which matches what I did before.

So 0.6 * S = 22,100 → S = 22,100 / 0.6 = 36,833.33.

Wait, but that would mean the starting salary was about $36,833.33. Then, the ending would be 36,833.33 * 1.6 = 58,933.33.

But looking at the options, none of them have $36k or $59k at the beginning or end. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the way the increase is applied. Maybe the 60% increase is the total increase, which is $42.50, but that can't be because 60% of S would be the increase, not the total increase. So perhaps the total increase is $42.50, which would mean 0.6 * S = 42.50 → S = 70.83.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the problem says that the average salary rose by 60% during a 10-year period. So the increase is 60% of the original, which is 42.50. So 0.6 * S = 42.50 → S = 42.50 / 0.6 = 70.83.

Then the end salary is 70.83 + 42.50 = 113.33.

So the starting salary was $70.83, and the ending was $113.33.

Looking at the options, option F is 70.83, 113.33. So that's the answer.
</think>

To determine the average weekly salary at the beginning and end of the 10-year period, we start by understanding that a 60% increase corresponds to an additional $42.50 per week. This suggests that the 60% increase is the total amount the salary increased, not per week. 

Let S be the original weekly salary. A 60% increase means S * 1.6 = original + increase. Since the increase is $42.50, the equation becomes:

0.6 * S = 42.50  
Solving for S:  
S = 42.50 / 0.6 = 70.83

The starting salary was $70.83. The ending salary is S + 42.50 = 70.83 + 42.50 = $113.33.

Thus, the correct option is F: $70.83, $113.33.
