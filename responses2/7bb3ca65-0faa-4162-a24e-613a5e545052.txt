Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says that a charged particle moves through a magnetic field and feels a force f. Then, new particles are sent into the same magnetic field. The new particles have twice the charge, twice the mass, and twice the velocity. I need to find out what the new force would be.

Hmm. I remember that the magnetic force on a charged particle is given by the Lorentz force law. The formula is F = q(v Ã— B), where q is the charge, v is the velocity, and B is the magnetic field. Oh wait, but the direction also matters because it's the cross product. So F is the magnitude of q times the product of v and B, and the angle between them.

Wait, but when velocity and B are perpendicular, the cross product's magnitude is just vB sin(theta), where theta is 90 degrees here. So F = qvB.

But wait, the question states that the new particles have twice the charge, mass, and velocity. So let's break them down.

Original particle:
Charge = q
Mass = m
Velocity = v

New particle:
Charge = 2q
Mass = 2m
Velocity = 2v

So substituting into the force equation for the new particle:

F' = (2q)(2v)B. Wait, but wait, that's not considering the cross product. Because the velocity and magnetic field vectors matter. But the problem says the magnetic field is the same and the direction is the same. So the angle between v and B remains the same.

So F' = (2q) * (2v) * B * sin(theta). Since the original force was F = q*v*B*sin(theta). So F' would be (2q)(2v)B sin(theta) = 4 q v B sin(theta) = 4F.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the mass? Because the mass is a factor in the momentum, which is involved in the acceleration, but the force is calculated from the Lorentz equation. Oh wait, but in this problem, the force is given as the force experienced. Because the question states that the new particles experience a force. So perhaps the original force is F = qvB (since the angle is 90 degrees, sin(theta)=1), and the new F' would be (2q)(2v)B = 4 F.

So the force would be four times as big. So the new force is 4F.

Looking at the options, option C is 4F. So the correct answer should be C.

The magnetic force on a charged particle is given by the Lorentz force law: 

\[
F = qvB \sin(\theta)
\]

where \( q \) is the charge, \( v \) is the velocity, \( B \) is the magnetic field, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field. For this problem, the magnetic field and the angle are the same for the new particles as for the original particles. 

The new particles have:
- Twice the charge: \( q' = 2q \),
- Twice the mass: \( m' = 2m \),
- Twice the velocity: \( v' = 2v \).

Substituting these into the force equation:

\[
F' = q'v'B \sin(\theta) = (2q)(2v)B \sin(\theta) = 4qvB \sin(\theta)
\]

Since the original force is \( F = qvB \sin(\theta) \), the new force is:

\[
F' = 4F
\]

Thus, the new force is four times the original force. The correct answer is:
