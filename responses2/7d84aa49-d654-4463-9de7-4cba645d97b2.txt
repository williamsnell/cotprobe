Okay, so I've got this question about real GDP per capita and how it relates to standard of living. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that real GDP per capita was $20,000 in 1980 and $21,000 in 1990. And the conclusion is that the standard of living has increased. Wait, but the options are all percentages, not absolute numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, real GDP per capita is $20k in 80 and $21k in 90. So the increase is $1k. But how does that translate to a percentage? Oh, right, it's the growth rate over the period. So the question is probably asking for the percentage increase from 1980 to 1990.

So the formula for percentage change is ((new - old)/old)*100. Let me plug in the numbers. New is 21,000, old is 20,000.

Difference is 1,000. So 1,000 divided by 20,000 is 0.05. Multiply by 100 gives 5%. So the percentage increase is 5%.

Looking at the options, option F is 5.0 percent. So the answer must be F.

The question compares real GDP per capita levels over two decades. The standard of living increases when real GDP per capita grows. The calculation for the percentage increase is ((21,000 - 20,000)/20,000)*100 = 5%.

Answer: F
