Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about molecular geometry. I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question asks which geometry corresponds to a substance that has five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons. The options are A through J, each describing different molecular shapes.

Hmm, I remember that molecular geometry depends on the number of bonding and nonbonding (lone) pairs of electrons around the central atom. So, sigma bonds are the bonds formed by the sharing of sigma (σ) orbitals, which are formed from the s and p orbitals. Nonbonding pairs are lone pairs, which are pairs of electrons not involved in bonding.

The question says there are five sigma bonds. Wait, but each sigma bond is between two atoms, right? So each sigma bond comes from a pair of atoms. But wait, no, each sigma bond is a single bond, formed by one sigma orbital. So for each sigma bond, we have a pair of electrons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Each sigma bond is formed by a single sigma bond, which is a single bond (single atom pair). So each sigma bond is one bond, which requires two electrons (a pair). So for each sigma bond, you have a pair of electrons involved. But the question says five sigma bonds. So that would mean five pairs of electrons involved in sigma bonds. But wait, each bond involves two atoms, so each sigma bond is a single bond between two atoms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no. Each sigma bond is a single bond between two atoms, and each bond is a pair of electrons. So the number of sigma bonds is the number of single bonds. So if there are five sigma bonds, that's five single bonds. But wait, the question says one nonbonding pair. So the central atom has five sigma bonds (five single bonds) and one lone pair.

Wait, no, wait. Each bond is a pair of electrons. So a single bond (sigma) is a pair. So if there are five sigma bonds, that's five pairs, meaning five single bonds. But wait, each bond is between two atoms. Oh wait, no. I think I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.

Wait, each sigma bond is a single bond, which is a pair of electrons. So if there are five sigma bonds, that's five single bonds. But wait, maybe each bond is a single bond between two atoms, and each bond is a pair of electrons. So five sigma bonds would mean five single bonds, which would mean five pairs of electrons. No, wait, each single bond is a single bond, so it's a single pair of electrons. So five sigma bonds would be five pairs of electrons in sigma bonds.

Wait, but the question says the central atom has five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair. So total electrons around the central atom would be 5 sigma bonds × 2 electrons each (since each sigma bond is a pair) plus one lone pair (2 electrons). So that's 5×2 + 2 = 12 electrons around the central atom.

Wait, but in molecules, the total number of electrons around the central atom is considered in a way that each pair of electrons (bond) contributes to the shape. So for a molecule, the number of bonding regions (both sigma and lone pairs) around the central atom determines the shape. So for example, in a trigonal bipyramidal shape, the central atom has five bonding regions plus any lone pairs.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the terminology. Let me try to outline the possibilities.

The question says five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair. So that's a total of 5 sigma bonds (each is a pair) plus one lone pair (also a pair), making a total of 5×2 + 2 = 12 electrons around the central atom.

But each "region" around the central atom (bonding or lone) contributes to the shape. So in molecular geometry, the number of regions (bonding + lone) determines the shape. So for example, if there are five bonding regions and one lone pair, that would be six regions in total (five bonds, one lone pair). The shape would be something like a trigonal bipyramidal with five regions (but wait, a trigonal bipyramidal has five regions, all bonding, and one lone pair would make six regions).

Wait, but wait. Let me think of the different possible shapes and their regions.

For example, a trigonal planar shape has three bonding regions and no lone pairs. But some molecules have lone pairs which increase the number of regions.

So, if there are five sigma bonds, that's five regions that are bonding. And one lone pair is another region. So total six regions.

So, what shape has six regions? Oh, wait, an octahedral structure has six regions. But that's when all regions are bonding. But the question has a lone pair, so perhaps it's a different shape.

Wait, no. Wait, an octahedral structure is six regions, all bonding. So if there's a lone pair, that's one region which is lone, so that's one less bonding region. So the structure would have five bonding regions and one lone pair, making six regions in total. So the shape would be octahedral but with one lone pair. But which shape would that correspond to?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The options are given as A to J. Let me think about each option and what their shapes imply.

The options are:

A: Bent
B: Trigonal pyramid
C: T-shaped
D: Trigonal planar
E: Trigonal bipyramidal
F: Linear
G: Square pyramid
H: Octahedron
I: Tetrahedral
J: Square planar

Wait, so each option describes a molecular geometry. So the question is which of these has 5 sigma bonds and 1 lone pair.

Wait, wait. Each sigma bond is a pair of electrons. So five sigma bonds would be five pairs. So 5×2 =10 electrons in sigma bonds. Plus the lone pair (2 electrons) → 12 total electrons.

But in molecular geometry, the number of regions (bonding and lone pairs) is what determines the shape. So the central atom would have 5 sigma regions and 1 lone pair → total regions is 6.

So the shape is a trigonal bipyramidal with a lone pair. But wait, a trigonal bipyramidal has five bonding regions and one lone pair. So the shape would be trigonal bipyramidal with a lone pair, which is the same as the given options.

Wait, but let me make it clear. The central atom in the question has five sigma bonds (so five bonding regions) and one lone pair (one region). So the total regions are six.

Now, which of the options has that?

Looking at the options, option E is trigonal bipyramidal. That's five regions. But here, there's a sixth region because of the lone pair. So the structure is octahedral-like but with a lone pair.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is trigonal bipyramidal. Let's think: a trigonal bipyramidal has five bonding regions and one lone pair, which would be six regions. So that would fit.

Wait, but let me double-check. Each option describes a certain geometry, which is the arrangement of the electron regions. So a trigonal bipyramidal would have five bonding regions and one lone pair. So the shape would have five sigma bonds (because each is a single bond between two atoms) and one lone pair.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the substance has five sigma bonds. So that's five single bonds, each contributing a pair of electrons. So that's 5×2=10 electrons in sigma bonds. Plus the lone pair (2 electrons) → 12 electrons in total around the central atom.

But in terms of the geometry, the number of regions (bonding and lone pairs) around the central atom determines the shape. So 5 bonding regions and 1 lone pair = 6 regions. Which shape has six regions? The octahedral geometry. But wait, the options don't have octahedral. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options again, option E is trigonal bipyramidal, which would have five bonding regions and one lone pair. So that would fit.

Wait, but wait, some of the options are for specific number of regions. Let me think again.

So the question is, which geometry has 5 sigma bonds and one lone pair. Each sigma bond is a single bond (two electrons). So five sigma bonds = 5×2=10 electrons.

Plus the lone pair: 2 electrons → 12 in total.

But the molecular geometry is based on the number of electron regions (bonding and lone pairs), not the total electrons. So for the shape, each region is a bonding or lone pair. So 5 sigma regions (bonding) and 1 lone pair → 6 regions in total.

The shape with six regions is octahedral. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the number of regions, not counting the lone pair? No, that's not likely. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: Bent → probably trigonal planar with one lone pair, but wait, no. Wait, a bent shape (like water) has a trigonal planar arrangement with one lone pair, making it bent.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about each option:

Option D: Trigonal planar → that's three regions, all bonding. So the central atom is in a trigonal planar shape, with no lone pairs. So that's three sigma bonds and no lone pairs.

Option E: Trigonal bipyramidal → five regions, all bonding. So the central atom has five bonding regions and zero lone pairs.

Option F: Linear → two regions, so a linear shape; but that's for molecules like CO2, which would have two bonding pairs and no lone pairs.

Option G: Square pyramid → four bonding regions and one lone pair. So total regions five. The shape would be square pyramid.

Option H: Octahedron → six regions, all bonding. So each region is a bonding pair, no lone pairs.

Option I: Tetrahedral → four regions, all bonding.

Option J: Square planar → four regions, two bonding, two lone pairs? No, wait, square planar is a four-region shape. Each region is a pair of electrons. So in a square planar, there are two bonding pairs and two lone pairs. So total regions four. So the shape would be square planar.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think: the question is about a substance with five sigma bonds and one lone pair. So the total regions are 5 (bonding) +1 (lone) = 6.

Looking at the options, none seem to have six regions. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding which option refers to which.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option E is trigonal bipyramidal, which has five bonding regions and one lone pair. That would make six regions. So the shape would have five sigma bonds and one lone pair.

So that would be the correct option. So the answer would be E, trigonal bipyramidal.

Wait, but let me think about another possibility. The question says "has five sigma bonds" → each sigma bond is a pair of electrons (so five pairs → 5×2=10 electrons in sigma bonds). Plus a lone pair (2 electrons). So 12 electrons in total around the central atom. But the question is about the molecular geometry, which depends on the number of bonding regions and lone pairs, not the total electrons.

So, five sigma regions (bonding) and one lone pair → six regions. The shape would be octahedral? But wait, the options don't have octahedral. Let me look.

Options are A to J. None of them are 'octahedral' as a shape. Wait, looking at the options:

H: Octahedron.

Wait, but octahedron is a shape with six regions (all bonding). So that's not the case here. So perhaps the correct option is E: trigonal bipyramidal, which has five bonding regions and one lone pair → six regions. So the shape is trigonal bipyramidal with a lone pair, which is option E.

But wait, another thought: the molecular geometry is determined by the number of bonding regions (bond pairs) and lone pairs. So if the central atom has five bonds (bonding regions) and one lone pair, the shape is trigonal bipyramidal with a lone pair. So the molecular shape is trigonal bipyramidal with a lone pair.

But wait, the question is about the geometry, not the shape. So the geometry is trigonal bipyramidal with one lone pair, which would be the same as option E.

Wait, but let me think again about the structure. A molecule with a central atom that has five bonding regions and one lone pair would have a trigonal bipyramidal shape, but with one lone pair. So the geometry is trigonal bipyramidal with a lone pair, which is one of the options.

So the correct answer is E: trigonal bipyramidal.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of some examples. For example, ammonia (NH3) has a trigonal pyramidal shape with one lone pair. So that's five bonding regions and one lone pair, which would fit the description here. So ammonia is a trigonal pyramidal molecule, which is option G. So which option is ammonia's shape considered? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is square pyramid, which is four bonding regions and one lone pair. So that would be five regions. So ammonia is a trigonal pyramidal (five regions) with one lone pair, which is option G? No, because in that case, the options would have five regions. But the question is about five sigma bonds and one lone pair, which would be six regions, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the options. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: bent
B: trigonal pyramid
C: T-shaped
D: trigonal planar
E: trigonal bipyramidal
F: linear
G: square pyramid
H: octahedron
I: tetrahedral
J: square planar

Wait, option E is trigonal bipyramidal. So in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, there are five bonding regions and one lone pair. So the shape would have a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, but with a lone pair. So the molecular geometry is trigonal bipyramidal with a lone pair. So the answer would be E.

But wait, another way to think about this is that the shape (i.e., the arrangement of the atoms) is trigonal bipyramidal, but the presence of a lone pair changes this arrangement, making the shape have a lone pair, which is a different thing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the molecular shape without considering the lone pairs, but that doesn't make sense. The presence of a lone pair affects the molecular shape.

Wait, the question is about the substance's geometry, so the correct answer is the one that has five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair. So the geometry is trigonal bipyramidal with a lone pair, which is option E. So the answer is E.

The question asks which geometry corresponds to a substance with five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons. Each sigma bond is a pair of electrons shared between two atoms, and the nonbonding pair is a lone pair of electrons not involved in bonding. The total number of regions around the central atom is determined by both bonding and lone pairs.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Number of Regions**:  
   - **Five sigma bonds** correspond to five bonding regions.  
   - **One nonbonding pair** (lone pair) adds another region.  
   - **Total regions** = 5 (sigma bonds) + 1 (lone pair) = 6 regions.

2. **Molecular Geometry**:  
   - A molecule with six regions around the central atom corresponds to an **octahedral geometry**. However, this is not one of the options provided.  
   - The closest match to six regions is a **trigonal bipyramidal geometry**, which has five bonding regions and one lone pair. This matches the description of the question.

3. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option D (Trigonal planar)**: This has three regions, so it does not match.  
   - **Option E (Trigonal bipyramidal)**: This has five bonding regions and one lone pair, making it a six-region geometry. This matches the description of the question.  
   - Other options (e.g., bent, square pyramid, octahedron, tetrahedral, square planar) do not describe six regions or the presence of a lone pair.

### Conclusion:
The geometry that corresponds to a substance with five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons is **trigonal bipyramidal**. This matches **Option E**.
