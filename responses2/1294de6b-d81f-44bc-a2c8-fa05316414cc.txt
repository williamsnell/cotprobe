Question:

A debtor owed a creditor $750 on an old debt. On July 1, the debt was barred by the statute of limitations. On August 1, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party and overheard him telling mutual friends that the debtor "is a deadbeat who weiches on his debts. " Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?

Options:

A: There was no mutuality of obligation.
B: The creditor's claim was based on hearsay.
C: The promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation.
D: It was violative of the statute of frauds.
E: The debtor was under duress when he made the promise.
F: The debtor had no legal capacity to enter into the agreement.
G: The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.
H: The promise was not made in a formal legal setting.
I: It was not supported by new consideration.
J: The debtor did not provide a written agreement for the promise.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

The question is about a debtor who owes a creditor $750. On July 1st, the statute of limitations was set, which probably means that the debt couldn't be repaid before a certain date. Then on August 1st, the debtor ran into the creditor and told mutual friends he was a deadbeat. Feeling guilt, he approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay the $750 on September 1. But when he tried to pay on that date, he didn't. The question is about whether the creditor can recover the debt because the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable.

The options are A to H, and I need to pick which one is the strongest point supporting the enforcability of the promise.

First, let me break down the facts. The statute of limitations is a legal term meaning that the debt can't be paid before a certain time. So if the statute was set in July, the debtor has until September to pay. But he ran into the creditor in August and agreed on September 1. Wait, that's the same as the statute's deadline. So the statute of limitations was set on July 1, and the debt was barred on that day. So September 1 is after the statute's expiration. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the statute of limitations is the time period within which the debt must be paid. So if the statute is due by July 15 or something, then September 1 is after that. So the creditor's statute is a problem because the debt was barred on the day it was due.

But wait, the key here is that the statute of limitations was set on July 1 — so the debt couldn't be paid before that date. So if the debt was due on, say, July 1, and the statute of limitations was due on that day, then the debt would be barred on the day it's due. But if the statute was a period like 12 months, then September 1 is way after. Wait, but the question says "on an old debt." So perhaps the statute refers to a specific time, like the default period.

But the main issue is about the debtor's promise. The question is whether the promise was enforceable. So the debtor made a promise orally on September 1st, promising to pay $750. But he refused when asked on that day. Now, the question is if his promise was unenforceable.

So what are the factors that determine enforceability of a promise?

1. **Mutuality of Obligation**: Both parties must agree to transfer the obligation. In this case, the creditor and debtor agreed to pay each other's debt. So that's a mutual obligation. So option G says "the debt was already barred by the statute of limitations." Wait, that's a possibility. The statute of limitations was a bar. But the statute didn't prevent the promise; it just limited the time to pay. So the debt was a matter of default. The statute of limitations would have prevented the debtor from paying before that date, but the debt was still due on that date.

Wait, no. Wait, the statute of limitations is on the debt's due date. So if the statute was set on July 1, then the debt was due on that date. But the statute doesn't prevent the debtor from paying on that date. So the fact that the statute of limitations was set on July 1 doesn't bar the promise because the debt was due on that date, but the statute allows payment on that day.

So if the statute was set on July 1, then the debt couldn't be paid before that date, but it was due on the same date. So the debtor couldn't pay before the due date. But if the statute allowed payment on the due date, then that's not a problem. So the statute doesn't bar the promise because it's the same day.

Wait, but maybe the statute of limitations is a period, not a specific date. So if the statute was set for, say, 12 months, then the due date is a month away. But the debt was due on the same day as the statute's due date, so the statute doesn't apply. So the statute doesn't affect the ability to pay on that day.

So back to the promise. The debtor's promise to pay on September 1 — but the statute of limitations was set on July 1. So the debt was due on July 1, but the statute allowed payment on that date. So the promise is still enforceable because the debt was due on that same day.

Wait, but the problem is that the statute of limitations was set on July 1, which is the day the debt was due. So the debtor's promise was to pay on that same day. So the statute didn't prevent the promise because the debt was due on the same day. So the statute is about the time, not the day. So option G which states that the debt was already barred by statute of limitations is incorrect because the statute of limitations didn't prevent payment on the due date.

Hmm, but wait, if the statute was a specific time, like 12 months, then September 1 is after that. Wait, no. The statute of limitations is about the period within which payment is due, not the specific date. So the statute of limitations being set on July 1 only means that the payment had to be made by then. If the debt was due on the same date, then the statute doesn't prevent the payment.

So the statute of limitations didn't bar the promise because the debt was due on the same day. So the debtor's promise was enforceable. So the strongest point would be if the promise was made under a formal legal setting. Let's look at the options again.

Option H says "The promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation." The issue is whether the promise was legally enforceable. If the promise was made under a formal legal agreement, like a written contract, then it's enforceable. But in this case, the debtor made the promise orally. So the promise wasn't made in a formal legal setting. So H is a possible issue.

Wait, but the question is asking which factor would provide the strongest grounds that the promise was unenforceable. So the strongest argument against the promise's enforceability would be if the promise was not made in a formal setting, which would make it void under the doctrine that a promise made under a formal contract is binding, while an oral promise is not.

Alternatively, if the promise was made after a default, but the statute of limitations didn't prevent it.

Wait, but the statute of limitations was set on July 1, which was the due date. So the debt was due on that day. So the statute of limitations didn't prevent the promise, because the debt was due on that same day. So the statute of limitations doesn't bar the promise. Therefore, the issue isn't the statute.

Another angle: what if the promise was made without any legal basis. If it's based on mutual friend's knowledge of his debt, that's hearsay. But the question is about the enforceability. So option B says the creditor's claim is based on hearsay. But that's about the evidence, not the enforceability. So the issue is about whether the promise was made legally, not whether the evidence is valid.

So the question is about the enforceability, not the validity of the evidence. So the issue is whether the promise was made legally, without mutual consideration, etc.

Looking at option C: "The promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation." Well, the debtor's making of the promise was out of guilt, which is a valid reason. But if the promise was made under a legal obligation, then it's enforceable. But in this case, the promise was made orally, so it's not a formal agreement. So the issue here is that the promise was made out of guilt, but that's not a reason against enforceability. Wait, maybe the issue is that the promise was not made legally. So, if the promise wasn't made legally, it's void. But if the promise was made legally, then it's enforceable.

Wait, but the problem is that the promise was made without any legal basis. So if the promise was made without any legal basis, then it's void. But the question is about whether the promise is unenforceable. So if the promise was made without a legal basis, then it's not enforceable, which would be a strong point.

Alternatively, if the promise was made under a formal legal setting, then it's enforceable. So which is better?

I'm a bit confused. Let me go through each option again.

Option A: "There was no mutuality of obligation." The debtor and creditor agreed to pay each other's debt, so that's mutual. So not A.

Option B: "Hearsay based." The issue is about the enforceability, not about the validity of the evidence. So this option is about the cause of the claim, not about the legal enforceability.

Option C: "Made out of guilt." The debtor's making the promise was out of guilt, which is a valid reason, but not a reason against enforceability. Wait, no—since the debt was due on the same day, the statute of limitations didn't prevent him from making the promise. So the issue isn't guilt, but whether the promise was made legally.

Option D: "Violative of the statute of frauds." The statute of frauds is about contracts made while in default. But the statute of frauds isn't about the time of payment. So the statute of frauds would prevent a person from entering into a contract while in default, but that's not about whether the promise was made legally.

Option E: "Under duress." The debtor ran into the creditor, which could mean he was under duress. But the question is about the enforceability, not just whether it's a valid reason.

Option F: "No legal capacity." The debtor might not have legal capacity if he's mentally or physically unable. But the question doesn't indicate that. It's possible that the debtor couldn't enter into a contract, but the question is about the promise's enforceability, not about his capacity.

Option G: "Debt already barred." The debt was due on the same day as the statute of limitations. So the statute didn't prevent the debt from being due on that day. So the debt was not barred by the statute of limitations. So G is incorrect.

Option H: "Promise not made in formal legal setting." If the promise was made under a formal agreement, it's enforceable. But if it was made orally, it's not. So H is a strong reason against enforceability.

Option I: "Not supported by new consideration." The promise involved mutual consideration, so that's correct. So I is not a reason.

Option J: "No written agreement." The agreement is oral. So J is correct, but would that be a strong reason? Well, a promise made without a written agreement is unenforceable unless it's considered a contract. But I think most jurisdictions require a written agreement for a promise to be enforceable, so J is a strong reason.

So now, the key point is between options C and H.

The issue is about whether the promise was made legally, not whether it was made out of guilt. So option C is about legal obligation, which is about whether the promise was legally binding. If the promise was made legally, then it's enforceable. If not, then it's not.

But the question is about whether the promise was unenforceable. So the strongest reason is that the promise wasn't made legally. So option H.

Wait, but another angle: the statute of limitations didn't prevent the promise because the debt was due on the same day. So the statute of limitations didn't bar the promise. So the issue is not the statute of limitations.

So the correct answer is H: the promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation. Wait, but the issue isn't guilt, but legal obligation. So unless the promise was made legally, it's unenforceable. But if the promise was made legally, then it's enforceable.

So the strongest reason the promise is unenforceable is if it was not made legally. So H is about not being made legally, which would make it unenforceable.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the options is a reason that the promise is unenforceable. So the strongest reason is that the promise was made out of guilt, which is a valid reason, but not a reason against enforceability.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the issue is that the promise was made under a formal legal agreement. If it wasn't, then it's void. But the question is about whether the promise is unenforceable, meaning it can't be enforced despite being made legally.

So the correct answer would be H: the promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation. Wait, but that's just a reason for the promise to be enforceable. But if it was made legally, then it's enforceable. So the issue isn't guilt. So I might be confusing this.

Alternatively, option H says the promise was made out of guilt, but that's not a reason against enforceability. So perhaps the correct answer is H only if it's about not being made legally. But if the promise was made legally, then it's enforceable. So the only reason it's unenforceable is if it wasn't made legally.

Wait, but the question is which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's promise was unenforceable. So the strongest would be option H, because it's about the legal basis, not about the content.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think again.

The options are about different reasons why the promise might not be enforceable. The strongest reason would be that the promise didn't involve legal obligation. So the answer would be H.

Alternatively, another approach: since the statute of limitations prevented the debtor from making the promise before the due date, but the debt was due on that same day, the statute didn't prevent it. So the issue isn't about the statute. The issue is about whether the promise was legally enforceable.

So, the strongest reason that the promise is unenforceable is that it was made out of guilt, which is a valid reason, but not the reason against enforceability. Wait no, because the question is about whether it's unenforceable, not whether it's valid.

So, the strongest reason is that it was not made legally. So the answer is H.
</think>

The question revolves around determining the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise to pay the $750 debt was unenforceable. The key factors to consider include whether the promise was made legally, whether it was based on hearsay, and other legal principles.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: "There was no mutuality of obligation."**  
   The debtor and creditor agreed to transfer the obligation, making this statement false. Thus, A is incorrect.

2. **Option B: "The creditor's claim was based on hearsay."**  
   The issue is about the enforceability of the promise, not the validity of the evidence. Therefore, B is not the strongest reason.

3. **Option C: "The promise was made out of guilt, not legal obligation."**  
   The debtor's making of the promise was out of guilt, a valid reason, but this does not bar enforceability. Thus, C is not the strongest reason.

4. **Option D: "It was violative of the statute of frauds."**  
   The statute of frauds pertains to contracts made while in default, not to payment timelines. Hence, D is incorrect.

5. **Option E: "The debtor was under duress when he made the promise."**  
   While the debtor ran into the creditor, this is not a legal basis for unenforceability. Thus, E is incorrect.

6. **Option F: "The debtor had no legal capacity to enter into the agreement."**  
   The question does not indicate the debtor's legal capacity. Therefore, F is incorrect.

7. **Option G: "The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations."**  
   The debt was due on the same day as the statute of limitations. Since the statute did not prevent payment on that day, this statement is incorrect.

8. **Option H: "The promise was not made in a formal legal setting."**  
   The promise was made legally, but if it was not made legally, it would be unenforceable. This is the strongest reason provided.

9. **Option I: "It was not supported by new consideration."**  
   The promise involved mutual consideration, so this is correct but not relevant to enforcability.

10. **Option J: "The debtor did not provide a written agreement for the promise."**  
    The agreement was oral, making this a strong reason for unenforceability.

### Conclusion:
The strongest grounds for the debtor's promise being unenforceable are that it was not made legally. While option H is correct in this context, option J is also a valid reason. However, the issue is about the legal basis of the promise, making H the most relevant answer.
