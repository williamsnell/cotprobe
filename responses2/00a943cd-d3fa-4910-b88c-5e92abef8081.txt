Question:

A cylindrical container is to be produced whose capacity is 10 cubic feet.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this optimization problem where I need to find the dimensions of a cylindrical container that minimizes the total cost. The container's capacity is 10 cubic feet. The top and bottom are made of a more expensive material, costing $2 per square foot, while the side (the lateral surface) is cheaper at $1.50 per square foot. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

First, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is given by V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the volume is fixed at 10 cubic feet, I can express h in terms of r. So, h = V/(πr²) = 10/(πr²). That's important because I can substitute this into the cost equation.

Next, I think about the cost function. The cost has two parts: the top and bottom, and the side. The top and bottom are circles, so each has an area of πr². Since there are two of them, their combined area is 2 * πr². The cost for the top and bottom would then be 2 * (πr²) * $2 per square foot. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the material for top and bottom is $2 per square foot. So each top and bottom is πr², so two of them would be 2πr², and the cost is 2πr² * 2 = 4πr² dollars.

The side is the lateral surface area, which is 2πrh. The cost for the side is 2πrh * $1.50 per square foot. So the side cost is 3πrh dollars.

So the total cost C is the sum of the top/bottom cost and the side cost. So C = 4πr² + 3πrh.

Now, substitute h from the volume equation into this. So h = 10/(πr²). Plugging that into the cost equation gives:

C(r) = 4πr² + 3πr*(10/(πr²)).

Simplify this: 4πr² + (30r)/r². Wait, the r in the numerator and denominator: 3πr * (10/(π r²)) = 3πr * 10/(π r²) = (30 π r )/(π r²) )= 30/r.

So C(r) = 4π r² + 30/r.

Now, to find the minimum cost, I need to take the derivative of C with respect to r and set it equal to zero.

So dC/dr = derivative of 4π r² is 8π r, and the derivative of 30/r is -30/r². So:

dC/dr = 8π r - 30/r².

Set this equal to zero for minimization:

8π r - 30 / r² = 0.

Bring the second term to the other side:

8π r = 30 / r².

Multiply both sides by r² to eliminate the denominator:

8π r³ = 30.

Solve for r³:

r³ = 30/(8π) = (15)/(4π) ≈ 15/(12.566) ≈ 1.193.

So r = cube root of 1.193. Let's compute that. The cube root of 1 is 1, and cube root of 8 is 2. So 1.193 is a bit more than 1. Let me compute it: 1.06^3 is about 1.191 (since 1.06^3 = 1.06 * 1.06 = 1.1236, *1.06 ≈ 1.191). So cube root of 1.193 is approximately 1.06 feet. So r ≈ 1.061 feet.

Then, to find h, plug back into h = 10/(πr²): h = 10/(π*(1.061)^2). Let's compute 1.061 squared: 1.061 * 1.061 ≈ 1.125. So h = 10/(π * 1.125) ≈ 10/(3.534) ≈ 2.828 feet.

Wait, 1.125 is approximately 9/8 (since 9/8 is 1.125). So 10/(9/8 π )= 80/(9π). Let me compute that: 80/(9*3.1416) ≈ 80/(28.274) ≈ 2.828 feet. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option A is r=1.061, h=2.828, which matches. So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves minimizing the cost of a cylindrical container with a fixed volume of 10 cubic feet. The cost is determined by the top and bottom materials (more expensive) and the side material (cheaper). By expressing the height in terms of the radius and substituting into the cost function, we derive a cost equation in terms of the radius. Taking the derivative and setting it to zero yields the optimal radius, which is approximately 1.061 feet. Substituting this back into the height equation gives a height of approximately 2.828 feet. This matches option A.

Answer: A: r = 1.061 feet, h = 2.828 feet
