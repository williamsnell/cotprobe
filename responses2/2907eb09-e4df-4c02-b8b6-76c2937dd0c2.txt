Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Socrates and his beliefs. Hmm, let me think through this. 

The question is about what the last character of the response must be. So, the answer options are A to J, but the user specifies the last character, so I should focus on that.

The question is about Socrates' claim that "virtue is knowledge." I remember that Socrates is known for his belief that wisdom and virtue come from knowledge. So, this seems to tie into his other statement about unexamined life not being worth living. Oh wait, right, the Socratic method emphasizes asking questions to discover knowledge. So, if someone knows nothing, they can't know anything else.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The unexamined life is one where we live without questioning. That sounds like Socrates' belief that being unaware leads to not questioning, hence not being worthwhile. So that fits because if you don't know, you don't know how to guide others, so the unexamined life is a waste.

Option B: Socrates claimed to know nothing, which is about his own assertion. But the question is about his belief that virtue is knowledge, so this seems more about his own claim rather than how he relates to the belief. So probably not B.

Option C: About seeking traditional beliefs and how some answers are better. That seems more like the method Socrates used, not his belief about virtue being knowledge.

Option D: The only way to be good is to know human behavior based on norms. That's more like the modern view of ethics, where people are guided by universal values. Socrates didn't believe in universal values, he believed in self-conscience and the pursuit of knowledge. So D doesn't seem right.

Putting it together, the correct answer should be A. Because the unexamined life is not worth living because you can't know how to act, so virtue comes from knowledge, and thus the unexamined life is one where you don't ask questions, hence the statement.
