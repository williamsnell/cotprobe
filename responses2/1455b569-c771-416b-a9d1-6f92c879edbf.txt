Okay, so I have this law question here about Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' I remember that Hart is a philosopher, probably from U.K., and he wrote about legal concepts. The question is asking which statement best explains this distinction.

Hmm, I think Hart wrote a lot about obligations in law. I remember that obligations can be formal and substantive. Formal obligations are about the law itself, like if someone's a lawyer, they have a formal duty to practice law. But what about substantive obligations? That's about the actual consequences, like whether you have to pay taxes or something.

Wait, the question is about the distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' So, being obliged might refer to something being required to do something, like a law that requires a person to do something, which is a formal obligation. Having an obligation could be something a person is forced to do because of their actions, like criminal responsibility.

So, Hart probably distinguishes between these two. Formal obligations are about the law and are more about the structure and rules. Substantive obligations are about actual consequences or the consequences of one's actions. So, when someone has a formal obligation, they're under the law, but when they have a substantive obligation, it's about the real-world consequences.

Looking at the options:

A: Refutes natural law view. I don't think Hart was against natural law; maybe he agreed. So probably not A.

B: Illuminates the concept of a rule. Rules are, well, they can be formal or substantive. Maybe this is about rules as general obligations, not just the law. Not sure.

C: Differentiates formal and substantive justice. That sounds right. Justice is about fairness, so Hart's distinction helps clarify between the law's obligations and the real consequences. So option C sounds correct.

D: Highlights individual rights in law. Rights are about freedoms, perhaps. Not sure.

E: Clarifies the relationship between law and society. That's a bit broad, doesn't directly tie into Hart's distinction.

F: Explains power-conferring rules. Not sure.

G: Distinction between legal and ethical obligations. Oh, wait, Hart did distinguish between legal and ethical obligations. For example, being legally obligated for something like a job (formal) versus being morally obligated for a crime (ethical). So G is another possible correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about Hart's specific distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' So perhaps it's about formal and substantive obligations. Which would be G, because that's about legal and ethical obligations. Or is it C?

Wait, another angle: Hart's work in "The Development of Morality" includes a distinction between formal and substantive obligations. So in law, formal obligations are about the law (like being bound by a contract, having a duty), while substantive obligations are about actual consequences (like criminal responsibility).

So the question is about Hart's 'being obliged' vs 'having an obligation.' So, the distinction is between formal obligations (being obliged) and substantive obligations (having an obligation). So that would point to G: distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations.

But wait, is 'having an obligation' the same as 'having an ethical obligation'? Because if someone commits a crime, they have an ethical obligation. So in law terms, that's a substantive obligation.

I'm a bit torn between C and G. Let me think again. The question says Hart's distinction is between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' So 'being obliged' would be the formal obligation (like a legal duty), and 'having an obligation' would be the ethical or substantive obligation (like criminal responsibility).

So the correct answer would be G: distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations. Because Hart's work in ethics does that.

Alternatively, C says it differentiates between formal and substantive justice, which are about the law and consequences. So maybe the question is about the distinction in law.

Wait, the question states Hart's distinction in law. So 'being obliged' could be about being bound by the law (formal), and 'having an obligation' could be about having a moral obligation, which is a substantive one.

So the options would be G or C.

Wait, the options are about Hart's distinction. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall: Hart argues that obligations can be either formal (about the law) or substantive (about actual consequences). So the distinction between being obliged (formal) and having an obligation (substantive) is the key.

But looking at the options, option G says 'distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations.' So, that's about legal (formal) and ethical (substantive) obligations.

Option C says it differentiates between formal and substantive justice. Oh, justice is a form of obligation (being bound by law). So that's about the law's obligations, whether they're formal or substantive.

Wait, the question is about Hart's distinction, which is between 'being obliged' (formal) and 'having an obligation' (substantive). So that's about obligations in law.

So perhaps the correct answer is G: distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations.

Alternatively, option C is about the law's obligations in general, not specifically about legal and ethical.

Wait, but Hart worked on both legal and moral obligations. So when he distinguishes between them, it's about how they're treated in law.

So, the statement that best explains Hart's distinction is that it differentiates between legal obligations (formal) and ethical obligations (substantive), which would be option G.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident. Another thought: option G says 'distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations.' So that's about the two main types of obligations. So Hart's distinction is in this area.

But another thought: in law, 'having an obligation' might be a specific kind of obligation, like criminal responsibility (which is a substantive obligation), so it's about consequences. So the distinctions would be between being bound by the law (formal) and having an obligation (substantive), which is option G.

So I'm thinking the correct answer is G. Alternatively, perhaps C is correct because Hart distinguishes between formal and substantive justice, which are about legal and actual consequences.

Wait, but the question is about obligations, not just justice. The question says Hart's distinction between being obliged (formal) and having an obligation (substantive). So I think option G is correct.

But wait, another angle: the options are:

G: distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations.

H: provides a guideline for the application of laws.

I: explains the role of judicial discretion in the law.

I think option H is about judicial practices, not the distinction Hart is referring to.

Option E: clarifies the relationship between law and society.

Option C: Differentiates between formal and substantive justice.

So if Hart's focus is on the distinction between being obliged (formal) and having an obligation (substantive), that's option G.

Alternatively, if he distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations, that's option G.

Wait, the question says Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' So I think that refers to the distinction between formal and substantive obligations. Hence, option G.
</think>

The question asks which statement best explains Hart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation.' Hart distinguished between formal obligations, which are about being bound by the law (e.g., being obliged to practice law), and substantive obligations, which are about having an actual obligation (e.g., criminal responsibility). These are distinct from legal and ethical obligations. The correct answer is G: it distinguishes between legal and ethical obligations, as Hart's work in ethics and law highlights this distinction. 

Answer: G
