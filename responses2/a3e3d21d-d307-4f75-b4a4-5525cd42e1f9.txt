Okay, so I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = (3s + 1) / [(s - 1)(s² + 1)]. Hmm, I remember that to find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use partial fraction decomposition. 

Let me start by setting up the partial fractions. The denominator factors are (s - 1) and (s² + 1), which are linear and irreducible quadratic, respectively. So, I can write F(s) as A/(s-1) + (Bs + C)/(s² +1).

So, (3s +1) = A(s² +1) + (Bs + C)(s - 1). Let me expand the right side. 

A(s² +1) is As² + A. And (Bs + C)(s-1) is Bs(s) + Bs(-1) + C(s) + C(-1) = Bs² - Bs + Cs - C. So combining all terms, we have:

As² + A + Bs² - Bs + Cs - C.

Combine like terms. The s² terms: A + B. The s terms: (-B + C). The constants: A - C.

So, the right side is (A + B)s² + (-B + C)s + (A - C).

The left side is 3s +1, which can be written as 0s² +3s +1. So, equating coefficients:

1. For s²: A + B = 0. 
2. For s: -B + C = 3.
3. For constants: A - C =1.

Now, solving this system of equations. Let's see.

From equation 1: A = -B.

From equation 3: A - C =1. But A =-B, so substituting, -B - C =1.

Looking at equation 2: -B + C =3.

So, we have two equations:

Equation a: -B - C =1.

Equation b: -B + C =3.

Let me add equations a and b: (-B -C) + (-B + C) =1+3 → -2B =4 → B= -2.

Then, from equation a: -(-2) - C =1 → 2 - C =1 → C=1.

From equation 1: A = -B → A= 2.

So, A=2, B=-2, C=1.

So, the partial fractions are:

2/(s-1) + (-2s +1)/(s² +1).

Wait, let me check that. The numerator for the second term is Bs + C → -2s +1.

So, 2/(s-1) + (-2s +1)/(s²+1).

Alternatively, I can split (-2s +1) into (-2s) and +1.

So, the second term is (-2s)/(s²+1) + 1/(s²+1).

So, now, the inverse Laplace transform of each term can be found.

The inverse Laplace of 2/(s-1) is 2e^(t).

The inverse Laplace of (-2s)/(s²+1) is -2 cos t. Because the Laplace transform of cos(t) is s/(s²+1), so (-2s)/(s²+1) would be -2 cos t.

The inverse Laplace of 1/(s² +1) is sin t.

Putting it all together, the inverse Laplace of F(s) is 2e^t -2 cos t + sin t.

Looking at the options, let's see which matches this. Option G is 2e^t - 2 cos t + sin t. So, G is the correct answer.

To determine the inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) = \frac{3s + 1}{(s - 1)(s^2 + 1)} \), we start by decomposing it into partial fractions:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s - 1} + \frac{Bs + C}{s^2 + 1}.
\]

Expanding and equating coefficients, we find:

1. \( A + B = 0 \),
2. \( -B + C = 3 \),
3. \( A - C = 1 \).

Solving these, we get \( A = 2 \), \( B = -2 \), and \( C = 1 \). Thus, the partial fractions are:

\[
F(s) = \frac{2}{s - 1} + \frac{-2s + 1}{s^2 + 1}.
\]

The inverse Laplace transforms are:

1. \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{2}{s - 1}\right\} = 2e^t \),
2. \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{-2s}{s^2 + 1}\right\} = -2\cos t \),
3. \( \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{1}{s^2 + 1}\right\} = \sin t \).

Combining these, the inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) \) is:

\[
2e^t - 2\cos t + \sin t.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **G**.
