Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about discounts and net prices. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that Ringlet Wholesalers discounted their dining-room sets with a chain discount of 30% and 10%. The total discount offered was $248.40. I need to find the list price and the net price from the given options.

Hmm, so chain discounts mean that the discounts are applied one after another. First, a 30% discount, then a 10% discount on the already discounted price. Or wait, actually, does the chain discount mean both are applied successively? I think so. So the first discount is 30%, then the second is 10% off what's left after the first discount.

The way chain discounts work is that the first discount is applied to the list price, then the second discount is applied to the price after the first discount. So the overall discount isn't just adding 40% (30+10), but it's a combination.

Wait, no, wait. The way to calculate the net price is to multiply the list price by (1 - 0.30) and then multiply by (1 - 0.10). So net_price = list_price * 0.7 * 0.9.

But in the problem, the discount amount is $248.40. Wait, what's the definition of the discount here? Oh, I think the discount is the difference between the list price and the net price. So the total discount is list_price - net_price = $248.40.

Wait, no. Another way: The total discount is the sum of the two discounts. But that's not how chain discounts work. Because when you apply a 30% discount, the net price becomes 70% of the list price. Then applying a 10% discount on that would be 90% of the already discounted price. So net_price = list_price * 0.7 * 0.9.

The discount amount is list_price - net_price = $248.40.

So let me set up the equations:

Let LP be the list price.

After 30% discount: LP * 0.7

After 10% discount on that: (LP * 0.7) * 0.9 = LP * 0.63

So net_price = 0.63 * LP

The discount is LP - 0.63 LP = 0.37 LP.

But wait, in the problem, the discount offered is $248.40. So 0.37 LP = 248.40.

Wait, that can't be. Because 0.37 is the combined discount factor (30% + 10% in chain). Let me double-check.

Wait, no. The way chain discounts work is that each discount is applied successively, so the net price is (1 - 0.3)(1 - 0.1) = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63 of the list price.

So the discount is 1 - 0.63 = 0.37 of the list price.

Thus, the discount amount is 0.37 * LP = $248.40.

So, LP = 248.40 / 0.37.

Let me calculate that.

248.40 / 0.37. Let's see, 0.37 * 672 = 247.44, which is close but maybe I should compute it accurately.

Alternatively, 0.37 is approximately 37/100, so 248.40 divided by 0.37.

Let me compute 248.40 ÷ 0.37:

0.37 × 672 = 248.64. Hmm, that's a bit higher than 248.40. Wait, maybe 672 is 248.64, so 672 minus a little.

Wait, perhaps I should do it properly. Let's see:

0.37 × 672 = ?

Well, 672 × 0.37 = 672 * 0.3 + 672 * 0.07.

0.3 of 672 is 201.6, 0.07 is 47.04. Sum is 248.64. So 672 × 0.37 = 248.64.

But the discount is 248.40. So 248.64 - 248.40 = 0.24. That means 0.37 × LP = 248.40, so LP = 248.40 / 0.37 = 672 - (0.24/0.37) ≈ 672 - 0.6216 ≈ 671.378. So approximately $671.38.

So the list price would be approximately $671.38.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.37 × 671.38 = ?

Wait, 0.37 × 671.38.

0.37 × 600 = 222.

0.37 × 71.38 = ?

0.37 × 70 = 25.9.

0.37 × 1.38 ≈ 0.50.

So 25.9 + 0.50 = 26.4.

So total 222 + 26.4 = 248.4. Perfect.

So the list price is $671.38. But looking at the options, I see option B says list price $992, which is higher. Option F says list price $671.35, which is close. So perhaps my calculation is correct, and the list price is approximately $671.38, but the options have $671.35 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: List price: $992.00, Net price: $671.35.

Option F: List price: $671.35, Net price: $422.95.

Hmm, I calculated LP as approximately $671.38. So none of the options exactly match, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think again. What's the net price calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the net price is the remaining amount after the discounts. So if the total discount is $248.40, then net price = LP - 248.40.

But wait, no, the net price is LP × 0.63, as I had before. So net_price = 0.63 LP.

So the discount is LP - 0.63 LP = 0.37 LP. So 0.37 LP = 248.40 → LP = 248.40 / 0.37 = 672.432... So approximately $672.43. But looking at the options, option B's list price is $992, which seems too high. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discount calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the discounts are not applied as 30% followed by 10%, but perhaps the total discount is 40% (30+10). But that's incorrect because chain discounts mean applying each discount successively, not adding them. So 30% then 10% is 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63.

Wait, so the net price is 63% of the list price.

So the discount is 37% of the list price, which is $248.40. So LP = 248.40 / 0.37.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

248.40 divided by 0.37.

Let me compute 248.4 / 0.37.

Let me compute 248.4 ÷ 0.37:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100: 24840 ÷ 37.

Let me compute 37 × 672 = 37 × 600 = 22200, 37 ×72=2664 → 22200+2664=24864. Hmm, but 37 × 672 = 24864.

But 24840 is less than that. So 672 × 37 =24864.

So 24840 is 24864 minus 24, which is 672 - (24/37). So 24 ÷ 37 is approximately 0.6486. So 672 - 0.6486 ≈671.3514.

So 24840 ÷37 ≈671.3514.

So LP = 671.3514... approximately $671.35.

Looking at the options, option F says list price $671.35, and net price $422.95.

Let me check the net price.

Net price = 0.63 × LP.

If LP is 671.35, then 0.63 × 671.35 = ?

Let me compute 0.63 × 600 = 378.

0.63 × 71.35 = ?

71 × 0.63 = 44.73, 0.35 ×0.63=0.2205 → 44.73 + 0.2205=44.9505.

So total net price is 378 +44.9505 = 422.9505, which rounds to $422.95.

So that matches option F: list price $671.35, net price $422.95.

But wait, earlier when I computed using the discount directly, I got the net price as $671.38, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps the question is about the total discount being $248.40, which is the sum of the two discounts, but that's not how chain discounts work.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, maybe the $248.40 is the total discount, which is the sum of the two discounts. But that's incorrect because a chain discount applies both at once. So the total discount is 37% of the list price, which is $248.40.

So, yeah, the list price is $671.35, which is option F's list price. Net price is $422.95, which is option F's net price.

So the correct option is F.

Wait, but option B's net price is $671.35, same as F's. So perhaps the question is about the net price. Hmm, not sure. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "the discount offered was $248.40, what was the list price and the net price of each set?"

So the $248.40 is the total discount. So list price is LP, net price is LP × 0.63.

The discount is LP - net price = 0.37 LP = $248.40 → LP = 248.40 / 0.37 ≈ 672.43.

But the options don't have this. The options have F and B with list prices around 671 or 992.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 248.40 ÷ 0.37 precisely.

Using a calculator, 248.40 ÷ 0.37 = ?

Well, 0.37 × 671 = 0.37 × 600 = 222, 0.37 ×71=26.27 → 222 +26.27=248.27.

So 671 × 0.37 = 248.27, which is less than 248.40 → difference is 0.13.

So 0.37 × x = 0.13 → x= 0.13 / 0.37 ≈0.3514.

So 671 +0.3514≈671.3514 → approximately 671.35.

So LP is $671.35. Which matches option F.

So the correct answer is F: List price $671.35, Net price $422.95.

Wait, but earlier when I thought the net price was $0.63 ×671.35=422.95, that's correct.

So that would be option F.

The problem involves calculating the list price and net price given a chain discount and the total discount amount. The chain discounts are 30% and 10%, and the total discount is $248.40.

1. **Understanding the Chain Discounts**: The discounts are applied successively. The first discount reduces the list price to 70% (100% - 30%), and the second discount reduces this further to 90% (100% - 10%). Thus, the net price is 70% of 90% of the list price, which is 0.7 × 0.9 = 0.63, or 63% of the list price.

2. **Calculating the List Price**: The total discount is the difference between the list price and the net price. The discount is 37% of the list price (100% - 63%). Given the discount is $248.40, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.37 \times \text{List Price} = 248.40
   \]
   Solving for the list price:
   \[
   \text{List Price} = \frac{248.40}{0.37} = 672.43
   \]
   However, none of the options match this exact value. The closest match is option F, where the list price is approximately $671.35.

3. **Verifying the Net Price**: Using option F's list price, the net price is calculated as 63% of $671.35:
   \[
   \text{Net Price} = 0.63 \times 671.35 = 422.95
   \]
   This matches option F's net price.

4. **Conclusion**: The correct option is F, as it provides the list price and net price that align with the given discount.
