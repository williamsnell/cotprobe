Okay, I've got this problem here where I need to solve a system of three linear equations using Cramer's Rule. Let me see, the equations are:

1. 2x + 3y + z = 8
2. 4x + 4y + 4z = 12
3. x + y + 8z = 10

Hmm, first, I remember that Cramer's Rule involves using determinants. So, for a system of equations like:

a1x + b1y + c1z = d1  
a2x + b2y + c2z = d2  
a3x + b3y + c3z = d3

We can set up the coefficient matrix and compute determinants. The variables x, y, z are each replaced by the determinant of a matrix where the respective column is replaced by the constants d1, d2, d3. Then x is the determinant of that matrix divided by the determinant of the coefficient matrix.

Wait, but before I proceed, I should check if the coefficient matrix is invertible. That means its determinant shouldn't be zero. Let me compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix.

The coefficient matrix is:
|2  3  1|
|4  4  4|
|1  1  8|

Calculating the determinant: 2*(4*8 - 4*1) - 3*(4*8 - 4*1) + 1*(4*1 - 4*1). Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So applying this to our matrix:

a=2, b=3, c=1  
d=4, e=4, f=4  
g=1, h=1, i=8  

So determinant = 2*(4*8 - 4*1) - 3*(4*8 -4*1) + 1*(4*1 -4*1)

Compute each part:

4*8 is 32, 4*1 is 4. 32-4=28. So 2*(28)=56.

Then, the next term: 4*8=32, 4*1=4. 32-4=28. So -3*28= -84.

Third term: 4*1=4, 4*1=4. 4-4=0. So 1*0=0.

Adding them up: 56 -84 +0 = -28.

Oh, the determinant is -28, which is not zero. So the system is solvable by Cramer's Rule.

Now, let's find each variable. Let's compute x, y, z one by one.

For x, replace the first column (x coefficients) with the constants [8,12,10].

So the matrix for x is:

8  3  1  
12 4  4  
10 1  8  

Compute determinant:

Again using the formula.

a=8, b=3, c=1  
d=12, e=4, f=4  
g=10, h=1, i=8  

Determinant = 8*(4*8 -4*1) -3*(12*8 -4*10) +1*(12*1 -4*10)

Compute each part:

4*8=32, 4*1=4. 32-4=28. 8*28=224.

12*8=96, 4*10=40. 96-40=56. So -3*56= -168.

Then, 12*1=12, 4*10=40. 12-40= -28. 1*(-28)=-28.

So total determinant: 224 -168 -28 = 28.

So x = 28 / (-28) = -1.

So x is -1.

Now for y, replace the second column with the constants.

Matrix for y:

2  8  1  
4 12 4  
1 10 8  

Compute determinant.

a=2, b=8, c=1  
d=4, e=12, f=4  
g=1, h=10, i=8  

Determinant = 2*(12*8 -4*10) -8*(4*8 -4*1) +1*(4*10 -12*1)

Compute each term:

12*8=96, 4*10=40. 96-40=56. 2*56=112.

4*8=32, 4*1=4. 32-4=28. -8*28= -224.

4*10=40, 12*1=12. 40-12=28. 1*28=28.

Total determinant: 112 -224 +28 = (112+28) -224 = 140 -224 = -84.

So y = (-84) / (-28) = 3.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. So y's determinant was -84. Divided by -28, which is 3. So y is 3.

Now for z, replace the third column.

Matrix for z:

2  3  8  
4  4 12  
1  1 10  

Determinant:

a=2, b=3, c=8  
d=4, e=4, f=12  
g=1, h=1, i=10  

Determinant = 2*(4*10 -12*1) -3*(4*10 -12*1) +8*(4*1 -4*1)

Compute each term:

4*10=40, 12*1=12. 40-12=28. 2*28=56.

4*10=40, 12*1=12. 40-12=28. -3*28= -84.

4*1=4, 4*1=4. 4-4=0. 8*0=0.

Total determinant: 56 -84 +0 = -28.

So z = (-28) / (-28) = 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the answer choices don't have 1 for z. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the matrix for z. Let me check again.

Wait, the matrix for z is:

[2  3  8]
[4  4 12]
[1  1 10]

So determinant calculation:

= 2*(4*10 -12*1) -3*(4*10 -12*1) +8*(4*1 -4*1)

Breaking it down:

First minor for 2: 4*10=40, 12*1=12. 40-12=28. 2*28=56.

Second minor for 3: same as above, 4*10=40-12=28. 3*(-28)=-84.

Third minor for 8: 4*1=4, 4*1=4. 4-4=0. 8*0=0.

So overall: 56 -84 + 0 = -28. Which is correct.

So z is -28 / (-28) = 1.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see an option with z=1. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: [1,3,-1]

B: [1,2,2]

C: [1, -3, -1]

D: [-1, 3, 1]

E: [0, -2, 1]

F: [2, 2, -1]

G: [-1, -3, 1]

H: [-2, 1, 3]

I: [3, -1, -2]

J: [-1, -2, 2]

Wait, option E is [0, -2, 1], which has z=1. But according to my calculation, z=1, but none of the options have z=1. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the matrix for z.

Wait, the coefficient matrix for z is:

Row 1: 2  3  8

Row 2:4  4 12

Row3:1  1 10

So the determinant calculation is correct. So z=1. But the given options don't have z=1. Hmmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant for the z matrix again.

Wait, another way: Sometimes, I might use the method of expansion along the first row.

So for z's matrix:

2  3   8

4  4  12

1  1  10

Compute determinant as:

2*(4*10 - 12*1) -3*(4*10 - 12*1) +8*(4*1 -4*1)

Which is 2*(40-12) -3*(40-12) +8*(4-4)

Which is 2*(28) -3*(28) +8*0.

So 56 -84 +0 = -28. So z is 1.

But the options don't have any with z=1. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the system setup. Let me recheck the coefficients.

Looking back, the equations were:

1. 2x +3y +z =8

2.4x +4y +4z =12

3.x +y +8z=10

Wait, equation 2: when I compute 4x +4y +4z=12. So 4(x + y + z) =12 → x + y + z =3. Oh wait, that's an important point! I think I made a mistake in processing equation 2.

Equation 2: 4x +4y +4z=12. So, dividing both sides by 4, we get x + y + z =3.

But in my earlier setup for Cramer's Rule, I used the coefficients as 4,4,4, which I thought was the correct matrix. But wait, the coefficient matrix is [2,3,1; 4,4,4;1,1,8]. But equation 2, after dividing by 4, becomes x + y + z =3, so the coefficient matrix for z is 1,1,8 which is correct.

Wait, so equation 2 is correct. So z=1, but looking at the options, none have z=1. But wait, let me see the options again.

Wait, option E is [0, -2, 1], which has z=1. But according to the calculation, z=1. So maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant for the z matrix again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the minor signs in the determinant expansion.

The determinant is calculated as:

2*(4*10 -12*1) -3*(4*10 -12*1) +8*(4*1 -4*1)

Wait, that's 2*(40-12) -3*(40-12) +8*(4-4) = 2*28 -3*28 +8*0 =56-84+0= -28.

Hmm, correct. So z= (-28)/(-28)=1.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is [0, -2, 1], which has z=1. But according to this, the solution is x=-1, y=3, z=1. Which matches option A: [1,3,-1] no wait, x=-1, so the solution is (-1,3,1). Looking at the options, option D: [-1,3,1], which would be correct if z=1.

Wait, but in the options, option D is [-1, 3,1], which is [x,y,z] = (-1,3,1). So that would match our solution.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options don't have z=1 except for E, but wait E is [0, -2, 1], which suggests that perhaps I made an error in the setup.

Wait, let me think again. Did I compute the coefficient matrix correctly?

The equations are:

Equation 1: 2x +3y + z =8 → correct.

Equation 2:4x +4y +4z =12 → which can be simplified to x + y + z =3.

Equation3: x +y +8z=10.

So the coefficient matrix is:

Row1: 2 3 1  
Row2:4 4 4  
Row3:1 1 8  

Which is correct. So when computing the determinants for x, y, z, I replaced the respective column with the constants [8,12,10].

Which is correct.

So x is 28 / (-28) = -1.

y is (-84)/(-28)=3.

z is (-28)/(-28)=1.

So the solution is x=-1, y=3, z=1. Which is option D: [-1,3,1].

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options don't have a z=1 except for option E. Wait, option E is [0, -2, 1], which would suggest z=1, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the determinant for z. Let me compute the determinant again carefully.

For the z matrix:

2 3 8  
4 4 12  
1 1 10  

The determinant is:

2*(4*10 - 12*1) -3*(4*10 -12*1) +8*(4*1 -4*1)

=2*(40-12) -3*(40-12) +8*(4-4)

=2*28 -3*28 +8*0

=56 -84 +0 = -28.

Hmm, correct. So z is 1.

Then, the solution is x=-1, y=3, z=1, which is option D.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is [-1,3,1], which is exactly the solution I found. So why is option E present? E is [0, -2, 1], which would have z=1, but the solution we found for z is 1, but the x and y are different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check again.

Wait, when I created the matrix for y, I replaced the second column with the constants. So the matrix for y was:

2 8 1  
4 12 4  
1 10 8  

Which I computed as determinant -84, so y=3. Correct.

And for z, the matrix is correct, giving z=1.

Wait, perhaps I should check each equation with the solution x=-1, y=3, z=1 to see if it holds.

Equation 1: 2*(-1) +3*3 +1 = -2 +9 +1= 8 → correct.

Equation 2:4*(-1) +4*3 +4*1= -4 +12 +4= 12 → correct.

Equation3: (-1) +3 +8*1= 2 +8=10 → correct.

So all equations are satisfied. Therefore, the solution is x=-1, y=3, z=1, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is [-1,3,1], which is correct. So the answer should be option D.

To solve the system of equations using Cramer's Rule, we first compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix:

\[
\text{det} = 
\begin{vmatrix}
2 & 3 & 1 \\
4 & 4 & 4 \\
1 & 1 & 8
\end{vmatrix}
= 2(4 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 1) - 3(4 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 1) + 1(4 \cdot 1 - 4 \cdot 1)
= 2(32 - 4) - 3(32 - 4) + 1(4 - 4)
= 2(28) - 3(28) + 1(0)
= 56 - 84 + 0
= -28.
\]

### Calculating x, y, z:
1. **For x**: Replace the first column with the constants [8, 12, 10]:
   \[
   \text{det}_x = 
   \begin{vmatrix}
   8 & 3 & 1 \\
   12 & 4 & 4 \\
   10 & 1 & 8
   \end{vmatrix}
   = 8(4 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 1) - 3(12 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 10) + 1(12 \cdot 1 - 4 \cdot 10)
   = 8(32 - 4) - 3(96 - 40) + 1(12 - 40)
   = 8(28) - 3(56) + 1(-28)
   = 224 - 168 - 28
   = -28.
   \]
   Thus, \( x = \frac{\text{det}_x}{\text{det}} = \frac{-28}{-28} = -1 \).

2. **For y**: Replace the second column with the constants [8, 12, 10]:
   \[
   \text{det}_y = 
   \begin{vmatrix}
   2 & 8 & 1 \\
   4 & 12 & 4 \\
   1 & 10 & 8
   \end{vmatrix}
   = 2(12 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 10) - 8(4 \cdot 8 - 4 \cdot 1) + 1(4 \cdot 10 - 12 \cdot 1)
   = 2(96 - 40) - 8(32 - 4) + 1(40 - 12)
   = 2(56) - 8(28) + 1(28)
   = 112 - 224 + 28
   = -84.
   \]
   Thus, \( y = \frac{\text{det}_y}{\text{det}} = \frac{-84}{-28} = 3 \).

3. **For z**: Replace the third column with the constants [8, 12, 10]:
   \[
   \text{det}_z = 
   \begin{vmatrix}
   2 & 3 & 8 \\
   4 & 4 & 12 \\
   1 & 1 & 10
   \end{vmatrix}
   = 2(4 \cdot 10 - 12 \cdot 1) - 3(4 \cdot 10 - 12 \cdot 1) + 8(4 \cdot 1 - 4 \cdot 1)
   = 2(40 - 12) - 3(40 - 12) + 8(4 - 4)
   = 2(28) - 3(28) + 8(0)
   = 56 - 84 + 0
   = -28.
   \]
   Thus, \( z = \frac{\text{det}_z}{\text{det}} = \frac{-28}{-28} = 1 \).

The solution is \( x = -1, y = 3, z = 1 \), which corresponds to option **D**.

ANSWER: D
