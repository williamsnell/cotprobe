Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me read it again. It's about a perfect gas undergoing isothermal compression. Hmm. So, I remember that in isothermal processes, the temperature remains constant. But wait, the problem gives me the change in volume and the final pressure and volume. I need to find the original pressure.

Wait, what's the formula for isothermal processes? Oh right, for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal change, the pressure and volume are inversely proportional. So, PV = nRT, but since T is constant, PV should be the same before and after. So, P1V1 = P2V2.

But wait, the gas is undergoing compression, so the volume is decreasing. Let me see the numbers. The volume is reduced by 2.20 dm³. Oh wait, wait, wait. The initial volume is V1, and after compression, it's V2 = V1 - 2.20. Or wait, wait, maybe I should read the question carefully. The problem says, the volume is reduced by 2.20 dm³. So, if the initial volume is V, then the final volume is V - 2.20? Or is it V - 2.20 dm³?

Wait, the question says, "reduces its volume by 2.20 dm³." So initial volume is V, and after compression, it's V - 2.20. So V2 = V - 2.20.

Wait, but wait, another thought: sometimes people confuse whether the volume of gas reduces by a certain amount, which could mean the new volume is initial minus that amount. So yes, V2 = V_initial - 2.20.

So, initial pressure is P1, final is P2 = 5.04 bar, V2 = 4.65 dm³. And the initial volume V1 would be V2 + 2.20. So, V1 = 4.65 + 2.20 = 6.85 dm³.

So applying the formula P1 * V1 = P2 * V2.

So, P1 = (P2 * V2) / V1.

Let me plug in the numbers. P2 is 5.04 bar, V2 is 4.65 dm³, and V1 is 6.85 dm³.

So,

P1 = (5.04 bar * 4.65 dm³) / (6.85 dm³)

Wait, let me compute that. Let's do the multiplication first.

5.04 * 4.65. Let me calculate that. 5 * 4 is 20, 5 *0.65 is 3.25, 0.04*4=0.16, 0.04*0.65=0.026. Wait, perhaps a better way: 4.65 multiplied by 5.04.

Alternatively, 5.04 * 4.65 = ?

Hmm, 5 * 4.65 is 23.25, 0.04 * 4.65 is 0.186. So total is 23.25 + 0.186 = 23.436.

So numerator is 23.436 (unit: bar·dm³).

Denominator is 6.85 dm³.

So P1 = 23.436 / 6.85 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division.

What's 23.436 divided by 6.85?

Well, 6.85 * 3 is 20.55. 23.436 -20.55 = 2.886. So 3 and then 2.886 left. 6.85 * 0.4 is about 2.74. 2.886 -2.74 = 0.146. So 0.4 plus 0.02 (0.02 is 6.85*0.02=0.137) gives about 0.42. So total is approximately 3.42.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's do the division 23.436 ÷ 6.85.

Let me see:

6.85 * 3 = 20.55.

23.436 -20.55 = 2.886.

Now, 6.85 * 0.42 = ?

Well, 6.85 * 0.4 is 2.74, and 6.85 * 0.02 is 0.137. So 2.74 + 0.137 = 2.877. Which is very close to 2.886. So 0.42 gives us 2.877, which is about 0.009 less than 2.886. So, 0.42 plus a tiny bit. Let's say approximately 3.42.

So P1 is approximately 3.42 bar. Looking at the options, option D is 3.42 bar. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I correctly interpret the volume reduction? The question says the volume is reduced by 2.20 dm³, so V2 = V - 2.20. So yes, V1 is V2 + 2.20. So initial volume is 4.65 + 2.20 =6.85 dm³.

Another thing to check: the formula. For an isothermal process, since it's an ideal gas, P1 V1 = P2 V2. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should check my calculation again to be sure. Let me do 5.04 *4.65 again.

5.04 *4.65.

5 *4.65=23.25.

0.04*4.65=0.186.

Sum is 23.25+0.186=23.436.

Divide by 6.85. Let's compute 23.436 ÷ 6.85.

Let me do 6.85 × 3.42.

Compute 6 × 3.42 =20.52.

0.85 ×3.42= 2.887.

So 20.52 + 2.887=23.407.

But our numerator is 23.436, which is a bit higher. So perhaps 3.42 gives 23.407, and 3.43 would be 23.407 + 6.85 ×0.01=0.0685. So 23.407 + 0.0685 =23.4755.

But our numerator is 23.436 which is between 3.42 and 3.43.

So 3.42 is 23.407, which is 0.029 less than 23.436. The difference between 23.428 and 23.407 is about 0.029. The total is 6.85 per 0.01, so 0.029 /6.85 ≈ 0.00423.

So 3.42 + 0.00423 ≈3.4242, so approximately 3.424 bar. So about 3.42 bar, which matches option D.

So the answer is D: 3.42 bar.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship for an isothermal process of a perfect gas, where \( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \). Here, \( P_1 \) and \( V_1 \) are the initial pressure and volume, and \( P_2 \) and \( V_2 \) are the final pressure and volume, respectively. The volume decreases by \( 2.20 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \), so \( V_2 = V_1 - 2.20 \). The given final pressure is \( P_2 = 5.04 \, \mathrm{bar} \), and the final volume is \( V_2 = 4.65 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \). 

First, calculate the initial volume:
\[
V_1 = V_2 + 2.20 = 4.65 + 2.20 = 6.85 \, \mathrm{dm}^3.
\]

Next, use the formula \( P_1 = \frac{P_2 V_2}{V_1} \) to find the initial pressure:
\[
P_1 = \frac{P_2 V_2}{V_1} = \frac{5.04 \cdot 4.65}{6.85}.
\]

Calculate the numerator:
\[
5.04 \cdot 4.65 = 23.436.
\]

Divide by the denominator:
\[
P_1 = \frac{23.436}{6.85} \approx 3.42 \, \mathrm{bar}.
\]

Thus, the original pressure of the gas is approximately \( 3.42 \, \mathrm{bar} \), which corresponds to option D.
