Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about patients who have injuries and the probabilities of visiting different doctors. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states: We have a group of patients who have injuries. 28% visit both a physical therapist (PT) and a chiropractor (C). Also, 8% visit neither. It also says that the probability of visiting a PT is higher than visiting a C by 16%. We need to find the probability that a randomly selected person visits a PT.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Let P be the probability of visiting a PT.
- Let C be the probability of visiting a C.
- We're told that P = C + 16% because the PT probability exceeds the C probability by 16%.
- Also, 28% visit both PT and C. So, the overlap between PT and C is 28%.
- 8% visit neither, which means the probability of visiting at least one is 1 - 8% = 92%.

Wait, that's the union of PT and C. So, the formula for the union is P(PT ∨ C) = P(PT) + P(C) - P(PT ∧ C). 

We know that P(PT ∨ C) is 92% or 0.92. And P(PT ∧ C) is 28%, which is 0.28.

So substituting into the formula:
0.92 = P + C - 0.28.

But since P = C + 16, we can substitute P in the equation.

So, 0.92 = (C + 16%) + C - 0.28.

Wait, let me make sure of the units. The 16% is 0.16, right? So:

0.92 = (C + 0.16) + C - 0.28.

Let me compute that. Combine like terms:

0.92 = 2C + (0.16 - 0.28)
0.92 = 2C - 0.12

Now, add 0.12 to both sides:

0.92 + 0.12 = 2C
1.04 = 2C

Divide both sides by 2:

C = 1.04 / 2 = 0.52.

So, the probability of visiting a C is 52%, or 0.52. Then, since P = C + 0.16, P is 0.52 + 0.16 = 0.68, which is 68%.

Wait, let me check if that makes sense. Let me plug back all the numbers.

So, P = 0.68, C = 0.52. The overlap is 0.28.

Then, the union should be 0.68 + 0.52 - 0.28 = 1.2 - 0.28 = 0.92, which matches the given 92%. That makes sense. So, the probability a randomly selected person visits a PT is 0.68, which is option J.
