Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. Alright, it's about a free particle, but wait, a free particle... That's interesting. So initially, it's at rest, right? The mass is 20 grams, but wait, grams are for mass, but in the unit system, I think we're dealing with centimeters, grams, and seconds. Oh wait, no, wait, the units are given in grams? Wait, wait. Wait, the question says the mass is 20 grams. Hmm, but I remember that in SI units, mass is in kilograms. So maybe I should convert grams to kilograms. Oh wait, but wait, the question says "kinetic energy," which is in ergs. Oh right, ergs are used in the CGS system. So the units are consistent.

The force applied is 100 dynes. I remember that a dyne is the unit of force in the CGS system, so that's good. Time is 10 seconds. We're to find the kinetic energy acquired. So I think I can use the impulse-momentum theorem here.

Wait, the particle is initially at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Then, when a force is applied for a certain time, the change in momentum is equal to the impulse. So impulse equals force multiplied by time. So the change in momentum (Δp) is F * t.

So F is 100 dyne. Wait, what's the unit of force in CGS? Dyne is g·cm/s². So 100 dynes would be 100 g·cm/s². Time is 10 seconds. So impulse is 100 * 10 = 1000 g·cm/s² * s = 1000 g·cm/s² * 10 s = 10000 g·cm/s² * s? Wait, units: F is in dynes, t in seconds. So F*t would be (g·cm/s²) * s = g·cm/s² * s → g·cm/s.

Wait, but I think the impulse J is F * t = 100 * 10 = 1000 g·cm/s² * s → 1000 g·cm/s² * 10 s = 10,000 g·cm/s² * s? No, wait, wait. Let me re-calculate. F is 100 dyne. Dyne is g·cm/s². So F*t would be (g·cm/s²) * s → g·cm/s² * s → g·cm/s² * s → g·cm/s. So impulse is 100 *10 = 1000 g·cm/s² * s → 1000 * (cm/s²) * s → 1000 cm·g/s² * s → 1000 cm·g/(s² * s) → cm·g/s.

Wait, maybe I should just calculate the impulse numerically. So F is 100 dynes, which is 100 g·cm/s². Time is 10 seconds. So J = F * t = 100 * 10 = 1000 g·cm/s² * s → 1000 g·cm/s² * s → 1000 g·cm/s² * 10 s? No, wait. Wait, the units for force are g·cm/s². Multiply by time s: (g·cm/s² * s) = g·cm/s. So the impulse is 100 * 10 = 1000 g·cm/s. So J = 1000 g·cm/s.

Hmm, but what's the unit of impulse? It's the change in momentum. Momentum is mass times velocity (kg·m/s), but the unit here is grams and centimeters. So perhaps I should convert grams to kilograms. So 20 grams is 0.02 kg. But let's think about the units. So 1000 g·cm/s → converting to kg·m/s. 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m = 100 cm. So 1000 g·cm/s = (1000/1000 kg) * (100 cm/m) → 1 kg * (100 cm)/100 m → 1 kg * 1 m. So 1000 g·cm/s = 1 kg·m/s. Because:

1000 g = 1 kg. Because 1 kg = 1000 g. And 1 cm = 0.01 m. So 100 cm = 1 m. So 1000 g·cm/s = 1 kg * (1 m) / (100 s) → wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, 1000 g·cm/s = (1000 g) * (1 cm/s) = (1 kg) * (0.01 m/s) = 0.01 kg·m/s.

Wait, no. Let me compute:

1000 g = 1 kg.

1 cm = 0.01 m.

So 1000 g·cm/s → 1 kg * 0.01 m = 0.01 kg·m/s.

Wait, so J = 1000 g·cm/s → which is 0.01 kg·m/s.

But the mass of the particle is 20 grams, which is 0.02 kg. So the final momentum p is J = 0.01 kg·m/s.

So p = m * v → v = p/m.

v = (0.01 kg·m/s) / (0.02 kg) = 0.5 m/s.

Wait, that's the final velocity. So the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

So m = 0.02 kg, v² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

So KE = 0.5 * 0.02 kg * 0.25 m²/s² → 0.5 * 0.02 → 0.01, 0.01 * 0.25 → 0.0025 kg·m²/s² → which is erg (since 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s²).

So 0.0025 kg·m²/s² = 0.0025 * 1000 g * 100 cm² → because 1 kg=1000 g, and 1 m=100 cm, so 1 m² = 10^4 cm².

Wait, let's compute it this way:

0.0025 kg·m²/s² = 0.0025 * 1000 g * (100 cm/m)^2 → Wait, let me think. Because kg·m²/s² is (kg)(m²/s²). So to convert to erg, which is g·cm²/s², I need to convert kg to grams and m² to cm².

So 1 kg = 1000 g, 1 m² = 10^4 cm².

So 0.0025 kg·m^2/s² = 0.0025 * 1000 g * 10^4 cm²/s² → 0.0025 * 1000 = 2.5; 2.5 * 10^4 = 25,000 ergs.

Wait, so 0.0025 kg m²/s² = 25,000 ergs.

Wait, but let me think again. 

Wait, 0.0025 kg·m²/s² = (0.0025 kg) * (1 m²) * (m²/s²) = 0.0025 kg * m²/s². 

To convert kg to grams: 0.0025 kg = 25 grams. To convert m² to cm²: 1 m² = 10,000 cm². So 0.0025 kg·m²/s² → 25 grams * 10,000 cm² = 250,000 grams·cm²/s². But wait, since 1 erg is 1 gram·cm²/s², that would be 250,000 ergs. But earlier calculation gave 25,000 ergs. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, wait. Let me go back. Let me do the unit conversion correctly.

We have 0.0025 kg·m²/s². I want to convert this to ergs (g·cm²/s²).

So:

1 kg = 1000 grams.

1 m = 100 cm → 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 10,000 cm².

So:

0.0025 kg·m²/s² = 0.0025 * 1000 g * 10000 cm² / s².

Wait, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

0.0025 kg = 2.5 grams.

1 m² = 100 cm * 100 cm = 10,000 cm².

So 0.0025 kg·m²/s² = 2.5 grams * 10,000 cm² / s².

So 2.5 * 10,000 = 25,000 g·cm²/s².

But wait, 1 g·cm²/s² is 1 erg. So 25,000 ergs.

But wait, that gives 25,000 ergs, which is option A: 25,000 ergs. But wait, let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps.

Alternative approach: since F is 100 dynes (which is 100 g·cm/s²), time is 10 seconds. Impulse J = F * t = 100 * 10 = 1000 g·cm/s² * s → 1000 g·cm/s. 

Momentum p = J → 1000 g·cm/s. 

Mass m = 20 grams. So velocity v = p / m = (1000 g·cm/s) / (20 g) = 50 cm/s.

Kinetic energy KE = 1/2 m v².

m = 20 g → 0.02 kg.

v = 50 cm/s → 0.5 m/s.

So KE = 0.5 * 0.02 kg * (0.5)^2 (m²/s²).

0.5 * 0.02 = 0.01.

0.5^2 = 0.25.

So 0.01 * 0.25 = 0.0025 kg·m²/s².

Convert to ergs: 0.0025 kg·m²/s² = 0.0025 * 1000 * 100 = 25,000 ergs.

Wait, no, because 1 kg·m²/s² is 1 joule. 1 joule is 10^7 ergs. Wait, no, 1 joule is 10^7 ergs. So 0.0025 kg·m²/s^2 is 0.0025 * 10^7 ergs → 0.0025 * 10^7 = 25,000 ergs. So yes, that's 25,000 ergs.

Looking back at the options, option A is 25,000 ergs. So the correct answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we use the impulse-momentum theorem, which states that the impulse (force multiplied by time) equals the change in momentum. The impulse is given by:

\[
J = F \cdot t
\]

Here, the force \( F \) is \( 100 \, \text{dynes} \), which is equivalent to \( 100 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm/s}^2 \), and the time \( t \) is \( 10 \, \text{s} \). Thus:

\[
J = 100 \, \text{dynes} \cdot 10 \, \text{s} = 1000 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm/s}^2 \cdot \text{s} = 1000 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm/s}
\]

This impulse equals the change in momentum, \( \Delta p = J \). The mass of the particle is \( 20 \, \text{g} \), so the final velocity \( v \) can be calculated as:

\[
p = m \cdot v \implies v = \frac{p}{m} = \frac{1000 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm/s}}{20 \, \text{g}} = 50 \, \text{cm/s}
\]

The kinetic energy \( KE \) is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

Substituting \( m = 20 \, \text{g} \) and \( v = 50 \, \text{cm/s} \):

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \, \text{g} \cdot (50 \, \text{cm/s})^2 = 10 \, \text{g} \cdot 2500 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}^2 = 25000 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Since \( 1 \, \text{erg} = 1 \, \text{g} \cdot \text{cm}^2/\text{s}^2 \), the kinetic energy is:

\[
KE = 25000 \, \text{erg}
\]

Thus, the particle acquires \( 25,000 \, \text{erg} \) of kinetic energy.
