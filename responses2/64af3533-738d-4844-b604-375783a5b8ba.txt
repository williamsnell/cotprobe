Okay, so I've got this question about finding the median of a set of numbers. Let me think about how to approach this. The numbers given are 5, 8, 12, 3, 9. Hmm, I remember that the median is the middle number in a sorted list. But wait, if there's an even number of values, do I average the two middle numbers? Or is it just the middle one?

Wait, let me clarify. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an odd number of observations, the median is the exact middle number. If there's an even number, it's the average of the two middle ones. So, first, I should sort the numbers.

Alright, let's sort the list. The given numbers are 5, 8, 12, 3, 9. Sorting them in ascending order would be 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. Wait, no, that's only five numbers. Oh wait, wait, no, I think I miscounted. Let's list them out again. The numbers are 5, 8, 12, 3, 9. So when sorted, it's 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. Because 3 is the smallest, then 5, then 8, then 9, then 12. Wait, no, wait—no, 5, 8, 12, 3, 9. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake in the order. Let me sort them correctly.

Let me list them in order. The numbers are 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. Oh wait, no, wait, because 3 is the smallest, then 5, then 8, then 9, then 12. So the order is 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. That makes sense because 3 is first, then 5, then 8, then 9, and the largest is 12.

Wait, but wait a second—no, is 9 less than 8? No, 9 is larger than 8. So the correct order is 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. So five numbers in total. Now, since there are five numbers, which is odd, the median is the third number in the sorted list. So counting: first is 3, second is 5, third is 8, fourth is 9, fifth is 12. So the median is 8.

Looking at the options, option B is 8. So the answer should be B.

The median is the middle number when the numbers are sorted in order. For the numbers 5, 8, 12, 3, 9, sorting them gives 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. Since there are five numbers, the median is the third number, which is 8. 

Answer: B
