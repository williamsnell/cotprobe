Okay, so I have this question about accounting terms, specifically about the difference between assets and liabilities. Let me try to think this through step by step. 

First, I need to recall what assets and liabilities are. Assets are things a company owns and expects to receive back in the future, like cash, inventory, property, etc. Liabilities are the obligations a company has to pay, such as loans or accounts payable.

The question is asking what the difference between assets and liabilities is called. Hmm, I remember from my accounting class that the difference between assets and liabilities is called net worth. Net worth is what's left after assets are subtracted by liabilities. It represents the value of the company's assets minus its liabilities, which should equal the owner's equity.

So looking at the options, option D is "Net worth." That seems right because net worth is essentially the equity of the company, which is the difference between assets and liabilities.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing any other terms. For example, profit and loss are related, but profit is what you earn, and loss is when you have a negative profit. Capital is another term, but that's money the company owns, which is assets. Investment refers to money put into the company, which is part of assets. Revenue is income, so that's different. 

Expenses are the costs the company incurs, which are subtracted from revenue to get net income. Cash flow refers to the movement of money into or out of a company. Revenue is about income, so that's separate from net worth.

So yes, the difference between assets and liabilities is net worth. So the correct answer should be D: Net worth.
