Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here: I need to find the limit of (sin(2x)/x)^(1+x) as x approaches 0. Hmm, limits can be tricky, especially when they involve exponents. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with limits of the form [f(x)]^g(x), especially when f(x) approaches something and g(x) approaches something else, it's often helpful to take the natural logarithm and then exponentiate the result. So, maybe I can rewrite this expression in terms of exponentials and logarithms to make it easier.

So, let me set y = (sin(2x)/x)^(1+x). Then, taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives me ln(y) = (1+x) * ln(sin(2x)/x). 

Now, I can compute the limit of ln(y) as x approaches 0, and then exponentiate the result to get y itself. That should give me the original limit.

So, let's compute lim(x→0) ln(y) = lim(x→0) (1+x) * ln(sin(2x)/x). 

Hmm, I need to find this limit. Let's see, when x is approaching 0, sin(2x) is approximately equal to 2x because sin(z) ≈ z for small z. So, sin(2x) ≈ 2x. Therefore, sin(2x)/x ≈ (2x)/x = 2. So, ln(sin(2x)/x) ≈ ln(2) as x approaches 0. 

Wait, but I have to be careful here because as x approaches 0 from the positive side, sin(2x)/x is exactly 2, but what about the negative side? Hmm, since x is approaching 0, but without specifying the direction, I think it's safe to proceed assuming the limit exists. But wait, for x approaching 0 from the positive and negative sides, does sin(2x)/x approach 2? Let me check for x positive and negative.

Wait, for x approaching 0 from the positive side (x→0+), sin(2x)/x → 2. For x approaching 0 from the negative side (x→0-), sin(2x) is still approximately 2x in magnitude, but x is negative. So, sin(2x)/x = 2x/x = 2. But wait, if x is negative, sin(2x) ≈ 2x for even x, but for negative x, sin(2x) would be approximately 2x (since sin is an odd function). So, sin(2*(-h))/(-h) = (-2h)/(-h) = 2. So, yes, regardless of the direction, sin(2x)/x approaches 2 as x approaches 0. So, ln(sin(2x)/x) approaches ln(2).

Wait no, wait a second. Let me correct that. Because when x approaches 0, sin(2x)/x approaches 2, so ln(sin(2x)/x) approaches ln(2). But actually, if x is approaching 0 from the negative side, x is negative, so sin(2x)/x is (approx) (2x)/x = 2, but since x is negative, it's (2*(-h))/(-h) = 2. So, it's still 2. So, ln(sin(2x)/x) approaches ln(2).

So, the expression becomes lim(x→0) (1+x) * ln(2). As x approaches 0, (1+x) approaches 1, so the limit becomes (1) * ln(2) = ln(2).

So, ln(y) approaches ln(2), which means y approaches e^(ln(2)) = 2.

Wait, but wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Because when x approaches 0, (sin(2x)/x) is 2, so (2)^(1+x) as x approaches 0 is 2^(1) * 2^x. 2^x approaches 1, so it's approximately 2. But let me think again, perhaps I missed something.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a Taylor series expansion for sin(2x) around x=0. The Taylor series for sin(z) is z - z^3/6 + z^5/120 - ... So, sin(2x) = 2x - ( (2x)^3 )/6 + higher order terms.

So, sin(2x)/x = 2 - ( (8x^3) )/6 + higher terms, which is 2 - (4x^2)/3 + ... So, as x approaches 0, sin(2x)/x approaches 2.

So, (2)^(1+x) = 2^(1) * 2^x = 2 * e^(x ln 2). As x approaches 0, 2^x approaches 1, so the limit is 2 * 1 = 2. So, that seems correct.

Wait, but the problem is (sin(2x)/x)^(1+x). So, our original expression is [2 - (4x^2)/3 + ...]^(1+x). As x approaches 0, the base approaches 2, and the exponent approaches 1. So, it's 2^1 = 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in taking the logarithm approach, since sometimes when dealing with exponents, you have to be careful with the limits.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (sin(2x)/x) as 2 * [1 - (2x^2)/3 + ...], and then raise that to (1+x). So, [2(1 - (2x^2)/3 + ...)]^{1+x} = 2^{1+x} * [1 - (2x^2)/3 + ...]^{1+x}.

Then, 2^{1+x} is 2 * 2^x ≈ 2*(1+x ln2 + ...), and [1 + a x + ...]^{1+x} can be approximated using the expansion (1 + a x)^{1 + x} ≈ e^{x (a + a)} }? Wait, maybe an alternative approach would be better.

Wait, perhaps using the expansion for (1 + a x + ...)^b as x approaches 0. Alternatively, perhaps using the expansion of the logarithm and exponent.

Wait, but I think my initial approach was correct. So, the limit is 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options: option B is 2.0, so that would be the answer. So, the answer should be B.

To determine the limit of \((\sin(2x)/x)^{1+x}\) as \(x\) approaches 0, we can use the properties of logarithms and Taylor series expansions.

1. **Rewrite the expression**: Let \( y = (\sin(2x)/x)^{1+x} \). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:
   \[ \ln(y) = (1+x) \cdot \ln\left(\frac{\sin(2x)}{x}\right) \]

2. **Simplify \(\sin(2x)/x\)**: For small \(x\), \(\sin(2x) \approx 2x\). Thus, \(\sin(2x)/x \approx 2\), and \(\ln(2)\) is the limit of \(\ln(\sin(2x)/x)\) as \(x\) approaches 0.

3. **Evaluate the logarithm**: As \(x \to 0\), \(\ln(y) \to (1+x) \cdot \ln(2) \approx \ln(2)\).

4. **Exponentiate the result**: Since \(y = e^{\ln(y)}\), we have \(y \to e^{\ln(2)} = 2\).

Thus, the limit is **2.0**, which corresponds to option B.
