Answer:

Okay, so I need to find the book value of a bulldozer after three years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method. The bulldozer was purchased for $15,500 and has a trade-in value of $2,600 after five years. 

First, I remember that the sum-of-the-years-digits method is a method of depreciation where the cost of the asset is depreciated evenly over its useful life. Unlike straight-line depreciation, which spreads the cost evenly each year, the sum-of-the-years-digits method gives more weight to older assets, leading to higher depreciation in the early years.

So, the initial cost is $15,500. The trade-in value after five years is $2,600, but I think that's the salvage value. So the depreciable amount is the cost minus the salvage value. So, let's calculate that first.

Depreciable amount = Cost - Salvage Value
= $15,500 - $2,600
= $12,900

Next, I need to figure out the sum of the years' digits for a five-year asset. The years are 1 through 5. So the sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15.

Now, each year's depreciation is calculated by multiplying the depreciable amount by a fraction where the numerator is the year number and the denominator is the sum.

So for each year:

Year 1: 1/15 of $12,900
Year 2: 2/15
Year 3: 3/15
Year 4: 4/15
Year 5: 5/15

But we need the book value after three years. So, we add up the depreciation for the first three years.

Depreciation Year 1: (1/15)*12900 = $860
Depreciation Year 2: (2/15)*12900 = $1720
Depreciation Year 3: (3/15)*12900 = $2508

Wait, let me check that math. 12900 divided by 15 is 860 per year. So year 1: 860, year 2: 1720, year3:2580.

So total depreciation after three years is 860 + 1720 + 2580. Let's add that: 860+1720=2580, plus 2580 is 5160. So total depreciation is $5160.

The book value is the original cost minus total accumulated depreciation. So:

Book value = 15500 - 5160 = 10340.

But wait, let me check the options. The options are:

A: 4,120

B: 8,250

C: 2,580

D: 9,360

E: 11,000

F: 15,500

G: 6,500

H: 5,180

I: 10,320

J: 7,040

Wait, my calculation gives $10,340, but none of the options is exactly that. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the depreciable amount. Oh, wait, no, maybe I forgot to subtract the salvage value earlier.

Wait, the depreciable amount is correct as $12,900. So each year's fraction is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in adding the depreciation for the first three years. Let me re-calculate.

Year 1: 1/15 * 12900 = 860

Year 2: 2/15 * 12900 = 1720

Year 3: 3/15 *12900 = 2580

Total: 860 +1720 = 2580, plus 2580 is 5160. So 15500 -5160=10340.

But the options don't have 10,340. The closest is option I, which is $10,320. Wait, maybe I miscalculated something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of the years. Did I add correctly?

1+2+3+4+5=15. That's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the depreciation is calculated on the book value, not the original cost. No, I think in the sum of years digits, the depreciable amount is the cost minus salvage, which we did correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the book value at the end of each year. Let me try that approach.

Year 1: Depreciation is 860, so book value is 15500 -860=14640.

Year 2: Depreciation is 1720, so book value is 14640-1720=12920.

Year 3: Depreciation is 2580. 12920-2580=10340.

So, after three years, book value is $10,340.

Looking at the options, option I is $10,320, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the salvage value in the sum? Oh, no, because the sum is based on the depreciable amount, which is cost minus salvage.

Wait another thought, maybe I made a mistake in the fraction. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is to sum the years as 5*(5+1)/2=15, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the book value at the end of three years, but the options don't have 10340. So maybe I should look again.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is $10,320. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the total depreciation. Wait, another possibilityâ€”did I compute the depreciation correctly each year?

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the years' digits is 15, so each year's fraction is n/15, where n is the year.

So, for Year 1: 1/15, Year 2:2/15, Year3:3/15, Year4:4/15, Year5:5/15.

Depreciation:

Year 1: 12900 *1/15= 860.

Year2:2/15 *12900=1720.

Year3:3/15 *12900= 2580.

Total: 860+1720=2580; 2580+2580=5160.

Total depreciation is 5160. So book value is 15500-5160=10340.

But option I is 10,320, which is close. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 12900 * (1+2+3)/15. Wait, 1+2+3=6; 6/15=0.4. 0.4 *12900=5160. Yes. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the book value at the end of the third year, which is the same as after 3 years. So the book value is 10340. But the options don't have that. The closest is option I: 10,320. Hmm, perhaps I should check if the sum of the years is 15 or 30. Wait, no, for 5 years, it's 5*(5+1)/2=15.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the sum includes the salvage value? No, because the sum of the years is the sum of the periods, not the value. So the depreciable amount is cost minus salvage.

So I think I'm correct, and the answer should be $10,340, but the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the depreciable amount. Let me re-calculate.

Cost:15,500. Salvage:2,600.

Depreciable = 15,500 -2,600=12,900. Correct.

Sum of years:1+2+3+4+5=15. Correct.

Depreciation each year: (1/15)*12900=860, (2/15)*12900=1720, (3/15)*12900=2580. Sum 860+1720=2580; 2580+2580=5160. Correct.

So book value is 15500-5160=10340. So the closest option is I:10,320. Hmm, but why the difference? Maybe the question is using a different method or I'm making a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the book value at the end of each year.

Let me try that:

Year 1:

Depreciation: (1/15)*12900=860.

Book value:15500-860=14640.

Year 2:

Depreciation: (2/15)*12900=1720. Book value:14640-1720=12920.

Year3:

Depreciation:3/15*12900=2580. Book value:12920-2580=10340.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So the book value at the end of three years is 10,340. So the closest option is I:10,320.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me compute 1+2+3+4+5 again. 1+2 is 3, add 3 is 6, add 4 is 10, add 5 is 15. Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but in the given options, option I is 10,320, which is 10,340 minus 20. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the sum is calculated differently. Maybe the sum starts at 1 instead of 0. No, the sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15.

Alternatively, perhaps the depreciation is calculated on the initial value instead of the depreciable amount. No, because that would be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the years is 10, but that's not the case for 5 years. 5+4+3+2+1=15. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the depreciation is calculated as (Cost - Salvage) * (Year / Total Years), but that would be the same as the sum approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I need to use the straight line method for the first two years, and then sum accordingly. Let me try that approach:

Year 1: Depreciation is 15,500 /5=3,100. Book value:15500-3100=12,400.

Year 2: 3100. Book value:12,400-3,100=9,300.

Year3:3100. Book value:9,300-3,100=6,200.

Wait, but that's the straight-line method. But the question is about the sum of the years digits, which gives higher depreciation in the early years. So the book value after three years would be different.

So, the sum of the years digits gives 10,340, while straight line gives 6,200. So, the sum of the years gives a higher depreciation in the first three years, so the book value is higher.

But the options don't have 10,340. The option closest is I (10,320), which is very close. So perhaps that's the intended answer, and perhaps I should go with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 10,320, which is option I.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 15,500 - (12900*(1+2+3)/15). Let me compute 12900*(6/15) = 12900*(2/5) = (12,900 * 2) /5 = 25,800 /5=5,160. So 15,500 -5,160=10,340.

Hmm. So the book value is 10,340. But the options don't have that. Let me recheck the options.

Looking at the options again:

A:4,120

B:8,250

C:2,580

D:9,360

E:11,000

F:15,500

G:6,500

H:5,180

I:10,320

J:7,040

So, option I is 10,320, which is very close to 10,340, but slightly off. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me check again.

Wait, 1+2+3+4+5=15. Correct. So, 1/15 *12900=860.

So, the calculation is correct, so the book value after 3 years is 10,340. But the closest option is I, 10,320.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the depreciation for the third year. Let me see:

Year 1: 860

Year2:2/15 *12900=1720

Year3:3/15*12900=2580.

Total depreciation: 860+1720=2580 +2580=5160. So, 15500-5160=10,340.

So, I think the correct answer is not present. But since option I is 10,320, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me check 3/15 *12900 again.

3/15 is 0.2, 0.2 *12900= 2580. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different formula. Maybe the sum is 15, but the book value after three years is 10,340. So, perhaps the answer is I, 10,320, but that's close.

Wait, perhaps I should check whether the depreciation for each year is being calculated correctly.

Another approach: maybe I should calculate the depreciation each year step by step.

Year 1:

Depreciation: (1/15)*12900=860.

Book value:15500-860=14640.

Year 2:

Depreciation: (2/15)*12900=1720.

Book value:14640-1720=12920.

Year3:

Depreciation:3/15*12900=2580.

Book value:12920-2580=10340.

Yes, same result. So the book value is 10,340.

But looking at the options, none match that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But since it's multiple choice, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the sum of the years is 10, but no, 5 years sum to 15.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 15 but the depreciation is for 3 years, so the sum is 3*(3+1)/2=6. But no, the sum is based on the number of years, not the years themselves. So 1+2+3+4+5=15.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the sum is computed differently, but I don't think so. Unless the question has a typo, but in any case, given the options, the closest is I:10,320.

Wait, perhaps it's a miscalculation in the sum. Let me check the sum again: 1+2+3+4+5=15. Correct.

So, I think the correct answer is 10,340, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 10,320, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the years is 15, but the book value is 10,320, perhaps I made a mistake in the third year's depreciation.

Wait, perhaps the third year's depreciation is 12900 * (3/15) = 2580, and the book value is 12920-2580=10340.

Wait, the option I is 10,320. So perhaps the correct answer is I. So I'll go with option I.
</think>

The correct answer is I: $10,320.

The bulldozer was purchased for $15,500 and has a trade-in value of $2,600 after five years. Using the sum-of-the-years-digits method, the depreciable amount is the cost minus the trade-in value: $15,500 - $2,600 = $12,900. The sum of the years' digits for a five-year asset is 1+2+3+4+5=15. Each year's depreciation is calculated by multiplying the depreciable amount by a fraction where the numerator is the year number and the denominator is the sum.

Year 1: (1/15) * $12,900 = $860  
Year 2: (2/15) * $12,900 = $1,720  
Year 3: (3/15) * $12,900 = $2,580  

Total accumulated depreciation after three years is $860 + $1,720 + $2,580 = $5,160. The book value at the end of three years is the cost minus the accumulated depreciation: $15,500 - $5,160 = $10,340. However, since option I is $10,320, which is very close, it is likely the intended answer.
