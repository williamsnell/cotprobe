Okay, so I've got this problem here about John and his souvenir hat pins. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says John divided his pins into two equal piles. So, if he had, say, N pins, each pile would have N/2 pins. That makes sense because two piles are equal.

Next, he gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. Hmm, okay, let's break that down. One pile is N/2. He takes one-third of that pile. So, one-third of N/2 is (1/3)*(N/2) = N/6. Then, he gives his brother half of that. So, half of N/6 is (1/2)*(N/6) = N/12. So John gave away N/12 pins to his brother.

After giving those pins away, John had 66 pins left. So, the original number of pins minus what he gave away equals 66. Let me write that as an equation:

Total pins initially - pins given to brother = 66

Which is:
N - (N/12) = 66

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no. John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. So the pile he gave from is one pile, which is N/2. So, one-third of that pile is (N/2) * (1/3) = N/6. Then, he gave half of that: (N/6) * (1/2) = N/12. So the total given away is N/12.

So the equation is:
Total pins (N) minus N/12 equals 66.

So N - (N/12) = 66.

Let me solve this equation. 

Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate the denominator:
12N - N = 66 * 12
11N = 792
N = 792 / 11
11*72 is 792, so N=72.

Wait, but I thought the answer might be 72, which is option B. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, another way to approach this: Let's see. He divided the pins into two equal piles, so each pile is P. He gives his brother one-half of one-third of P. So, one-third of P is P/3. Half of that is (P/3)*(1/2) = P/6. So he gives away P/6, which is the same as what I had before.

So, total pins he has after giving away P/6 is P - (P/6) = (6P/6 - P/6) = 5P/6.

And this equals 66. So 5P/6 =66. Multiply both sides by 6: 5P = 396. So P = 396/5 = 79.2. Wait, that can't be right because P should be a whole number. Did I make a mistake in the equation setup?

Wait, no. Because P is the number of pins in one pile. So if each pile is P, and he gave away P/6, the remaining is 5P/6. So 5P/6 =66, so P=66*(6/5)= 79.2. But that's not possible because the number of pins must be an integer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me reread it.

"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?"

Wait, maybe I should re-express the calculation correctly. Let me try again.

Each pile is P. He gives away (1/2) of (1/3) of P. So that's (1/2)*(1/3)*P = (1/6)*P.

So he gives away P/6, leaving him with 5P/6.

5P/6 =66 → P=66*(6/5)= 79.2 → which isn't possible because P must be an integer.

Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm dividing the pins into two piles, each pile is P. So total is 2P.

He gives away one-half of one-third of one pile. So from pile P, he gives (1/3)(P) * (1/2) = P/6.

So the pins left are 2P - P/6 = (12P/6 - P/6) = 11P/6.

And this is equal to 66.

So 11P/6 =66 → multiply both sides by 6: 11P= 396 → P=396/11=36.

Ah, so P is 36, which is the number of pins in each pile. So the original total is 2P, which is 72.

So the answer is 72, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about it, I set up the equation as N - N/12 = 66, which gave me N=72. That works because 72/12 is 6, so 72-6=66. So that's correct.

So the original number of pins was 72, option B.

The problem involves John dividing his pins into two equal piles and then giving away a fraction of one pile. By setting up the equation based on the remaining pins after the gift, we determine the original number of pins. The calculation shows that the original total was 72 pins.

Answer: B: 72
