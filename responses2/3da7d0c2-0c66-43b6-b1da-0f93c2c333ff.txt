Question:

A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22â€“ 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?

Options:

A: The patient is not a carrier of the DMD as her muscle creatine kinase concentration is within the normal range
B: The patient's mother is a carrier, hence the patient is definitely a carrier too
C: The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD
D: The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain due to lack of genetic analysis on her deceased relatives.
E: The patient has a 25% risk of having a child with DMD
F: The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her mother's elevated creatine kinase concentration
G: The patient's DMD carrier status is certain due to maternal transmission
H: The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD
I: The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation
J: The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this genetic counseling question. Let's break it down.

The patient is a 50-year-old woman who came to the physician. Her brother and maternal uncle both had DMD and died at 28 and 17, respectively. The genetic analysis wasn't done before she was conception. So, the family history is key here.

The patient's own test results: her mother's serum creatine kinase ( muscle) is 300 U/L. Wait, I remember that DMD is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder. So, carriers only get it from one parent. But since the patient's mother has an elevated level, that might indicate she's a carrier.

Wait, the patient's own creatine kinase is 120 U/L, but the options talk about family history. Her brother died at 28, and maternal uncle at 17. But the analysis wasn't done before she was born. So, the family history is the main thing.

Her mother had an elevated concentration of 300 U/L. If the mother has DMD, that would mean she has the disease. But wait, carriers can have either dominant or recessive. DMD is autosomal dominant, so a carrier has one copy of the defective allele. A patient with two copies (aa) would have the disease.

In this case, the patient's mother has a level of 300, which is higher than the usual. Does that mean she's a carrier? Or is it just a higher risk?

Wait, I think in DMD, the carrier would have a higher concentration than the non-carrier. So if her mother has 300, which is higher than the non-carrier's 120, that suggests she's a carrier. But wait, wait. How does that work?

Wait, but the issue is that the patient's own test result is 120, which is within the normal range. But the mother's is 300, which is elevated. So if the mother is a carrier, the patient has a 50% chance of being a carrier? Or is it that the mother's presence indicates she's a carrier?

Wait, but the question is about the patient's carrier status. The patient's own creatine level is 120, which is less than the mother's 300. Could that mean the patient isn't a carrier? Or is the mother's higher level showing she's a carrier, so the patient's chance is 50%?

But the family history is her mother's death. So, if her mother had DMD, she would have passed it to her children. So, if the mother had DMD, then the children have a 50% chance of being carriers. But wait, the patient is a carrier if she inherited it from her mother.

Wait, but the patient's own creatine levels are 120, which is within the normal range. But the mother's is 300, which is elevated. So, perhaps the patient has a 50% chance of being a carrier because the mother is a carrier? Or is that not applicable here?

Wait, but the patient's mother's level is 300, which is higher than the normal. So maybe she's a carrier. If she's a carrier, her children have a 50% chance of being carriers. But the question is about the patient's carrier status.

So the patient's mother is a carrier. If she is, then the patient, being a son, would have a 50% chance of being a carrier. But wait, the patient's own test is 120, which is in normal range, but that's for her own test. Her mother's test is 300, which is elevated, indicating she has the disease. So, if the mother is a carrier, the patient has a 50% chance of being a carrier. So the carrier status isn't certain.

Looking at the options:

Option G says the carrier status is certain because maternal transmission. But that's incorrect, because the patient's own level is normal. But the mother's is elevated. So, the mother is a carrier, which would make the child have a 50% chance.

So, the patient's carrier status isn't certain. So, option G is incorrect.

Option B says the patient's mother is a carrier, so patient is definitely a carrier. That's not correct because the patient's own test is normal.

Option D says carrier status is uncertain due to lack of genetic analysis. But no, the family history includes her brother and maternal uncle. The genetic analysis wasn't done on any prior relatives. So, the family history (the mother's DMD) shows she's a carrier. So, the patient's carrier status is 50% based on her mother's carrier status.

Wait, but the patient's own test is 120, which is within normal. But the mother's is 300. So, if the mother is a carrier, the patient has a 50% chance of being a carrier. But the patient's own test is normal, which suggests she's not a carrier. But if the mother is a carrier, then the patient has a 50% chance.

Wait, but the question is about her carrier status, not the chances. So, if the mother is a carrier, then the patient may be a carrier (50% chance) or not.

Wait, but the patient's own test result is 120, which is within normal. So, her creatine is normal. But if her mother is a carrier, her chances are 50% to be a carrier. But the patient's own test is normal, which suggests she's not a carrier.

Wait, that's conflicting. So perhaps the mother's test is the key here. If her test is elevated, that indicates she is a carrier. So, the child has a 50% chance of being a carrier.

So, the patient's carrier status is uncertain, as the mother is a carrier.

Looking at the options, option C says the patient is a carrier based on family history. But the patient's own test is within normal. So, perhaps the patient's status is not certain. The family history indicates she has a 50% chance.

But wait, if the family history includes the mother, who is a carrier, the patient's carrier status is 50% based on that. So, the patient's carrier status is not certain, so option D is the best choice.

Alternatively, option G says carrier status is certain because maternal transmission. But that's not true because our patient's own level is normal.

So, the correct answer should be option D. The carrier status is uncertain because the family history includes her mother, who is a carrier.

Wait, but the patient's own test is 120, which is normal, so if the mother is a carrier, the chance is 50% for the child. But the patient's own test isn't showing a carrier, but the mother's does.

So, the patient's carrier status isn't certain because it's a 50% chance. But the family history from the mother is the key.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says the carrier status is uncertain because of lack of genetic analysis on the mother. But the family history is included, so the analysis isn't needed beyond family history.

Wait, the patient's mother had DMD and died. So, the family history includes the mother, so her being a carrier would mean the child has a 50% chance. So, the patient's carrier status is uncertain because the mother is a carrier.

So, the correct answer would be D: The carrier status is uncertain due to lack of genetic analysis on her deceased relatives.

Wait, no, the lack of genetic analysis on her relatives isn't a reason. The family history (her mother's DMD) is the main factor. So, the patient's carrier status is uncertain because her mother is a carrier.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but another angle: the patient's own test is 120, which is within normal. So, if the mother is a carrier, the chance is 50%, but the patient's own test is normal. So, perhaps her heron's heron is a carrier, but her own test is normal. So, the patient may not be a carrier, but the family history suggests a 50% chance.

So, the correct assessment is that the carrier status is uncertain because the family history includes the mother, who is a carrier. So, option D.

Wait, but the other options: option E is about 25% risk, so why would that be? I don't think so.

Another thought: the patient's own creatine is 120, which is normal. So, her own status isn't a carrier. But her mother's is elevated. So, the family history shows she's a carrier, so the child has a 50% chance. Hence, the patient's carrier status is uncertain due to family history.

Thus, the correct answer is D.
</think>

The patient is a 50-year-old woman with a brother and maternal uncle both carrying Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) at ages 28 and 17, respectively. Her family history includes a carrier mother, whose serum creatine kinase (muscle) level is elevated at 300 U/L. The patient's own serum creatine kinase is 120 U/L, which is within the normal range.

D Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning carriers (heterozygotes) have two copies of the defective gene, while affected individuals (homozygotes) have none. The patient's carrier status is influenced by her mother's elevated creatine kinase concentration, which suggests she is a carrier. However, the patient's own creatine kinase level is normal, and the genetic analysis was not performed on any relatives prior to her conception.

The family history of DMD is the key factor in assessing the carrier status. Since the mother is a carrier, the patient has a 50% chance of being a carrier if she inherits the disorder from her mother. The patient's own test result is normal, but the family history indicates a potential carrier status. Therefore, the patient's carrier status is uncertain due to the family history of DMD.

Option D correctly states that the carrier status is uncertain due to the lack of genetic analysis on her deceased relatives, as her mother's carrier status is the main basis for assessing the child's carrier risk.

ANSWER: D
