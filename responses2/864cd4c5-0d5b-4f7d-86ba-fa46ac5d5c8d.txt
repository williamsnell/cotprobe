Okay, so I need to figure out this legal question about personal injury cases. The scenario is that a seat in a movie theater collapsed, causing someone to fall and have a back injury. The question is about whether the customer can recover in a personal injury action against the theater.

Hmm, I remember that in personal injury law, sometimes the plaintiff is liable even if they didn't choose to sit in a particular seat. Like, if the seat was defective and the customer didn't notice it, the manufacturer might be liable because they can't be held solely responsible for the accident. But wait, not always. Maybe it depends on whether they had a duty to inspect the seats.

So, the customer's options depend on whether they had a duty to warn or inspect. If they did, then maybe the manufacturer is liable. But if they didn't, then perhaps the manufacturer isn't liable, and the plaintiff can recover because of negligence by the manufacturer.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says the customer didn't recover because they chose the seat. But I think that's not right because even without a chosen seat, there might be damages.

Option B says they didn't recover unless they informed the theater. But if they didn't inform the theater, maybe the manufacturer is at fault, so the customer can't recover. Or perhaps not, because the manufacturer's negligence could be the issue.

Option C: recover only if the theater had previous complaints. Hmm, not sure. If the customer didn't inform the theater, then the manufacturer might be at fault, but if they did, maybe not.

Option D: recover if theater failed to warn. So if the manufacturer didn't warn, then the customer can recover.

Option E: recover only if theater had prior knowledge. If the theater knew about the dangerous condition, maybe they should have warned. But if they didn't, then the manufacturer is at fault.

Option F: recover only if theater inspected for safety. Oh, so if the theater inspected and found dangerous conditions, then they might be liable. But wait, the question says the seat collapsed. So maybe the manufacturer didn't inspect the seat, or the customer didn't notice it, leading to negligence.

Option G: not recover unless theater made a reasonable inspection. That sounds familiar. If the manufacturer did not inspect the seat properly, it's a breach of duty, so they're liable.

Option H: not recover because didn't suffer permanent injury. That doesn't seem right. It's about negligence, not permanent harm.

Option I: not recover because theater wasn't under obligation. Wait, the theater presumably had a duty to inspect the seats to prevent accidents. If the customer didn't realize they were in a dangerous seat, maybe the manufacturer is liable, but the theater wasn't under any obligation to inspect. So maybe the customer can't recover because the manufacturer's negligence is not covered by the theater's duty.

Wait, but the question is about the customer's recovery. So if the manufacturer made a mistake and failed to warn, the customer could recover under negligence. But if the manufacturer had a duty to inspect, and the customer didn't notice, then maybe the manufacturer is at fault.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: The plaintiff can recover if they were negligent. If the plaintiff didn't choose a safe seat, the manufacturer might be liable if they didn't warn. But if the manufacturer is solely responsible, then the plaintiff can't recover unless they had a duty to inspect.

In this case, the seat collapsed. So if the customer didn't know the seat was dangerous, the manufacturer may have been negligent. But wait, the movie theater's duty to inspect: I think there's a duty for the theater to inspect the seats to prevent such accidents. So if the customer didn't notice the seat was bad, the manufacturer is at fault. But if the customer had a duty to choose the seat, then perhaps they're not liable.

Wait, the question is about the customer's recovery. So I need to consider whether the customer had a duty of care. The duty to warn or inspect might be implied by the duty to the customer. So, for example, if the customer was in a seat that was unsafe, the theater might be liable even if they didn't know. But if the theater had a duty to inspect, then negligence is more likely.

Looking at the options, option G says: "not recover, unless theater made a reasonable inspection." Hmm, that seems relevant. If the theater inspected and found dangerous conditions but didn't warn, then the manufacturer is liable. So the customer can't recover unless the theater inspected (so that the manufacturer was negligent).

Alternatively, in option D: "recover, if theater failed to put up a warning sign." So if the manufacturer didn't warn, the customer can recover.

Wait, but the customer didn't suffer any permanent injury. So, for a recovery, the plaintiff must have been negligent. If the customer didn't notice the seat, the manufacturer's negligence would allow recovery, but if the customer had a duty to inspect, the manufacturer isn't liable.

Wait, I'm getting tangled. Let me try a different approach. The problem is about the customer's recovery in a personal injury case against the theater.

In personal injury cases, the plaintiff can recover if they were negligent. The key is whether the plaintiff had a duty to take reasonable steps. If they didn't, and the manufacturer was negligent in failing to warn, then the customer can recover.

But in some cases, the manufacturer's negligence is more severe. For example, if the customer had a duty to inspect the seat, then the manufacturer isn't liable.

So, for the customer's case, if the theater's duty to inspect was breached, then the manufacturer is at fault. In that case, the customer can recover. But if the manufacturer failed to warn, then the customer can recover.

Wait, but the question is, in the scenario, the customer's seat collapsed. So if the customer didn't notice the seat, the manufacturer is at fault. But if the customer had a duty to inspect, then the manufacturer isn't liable.

Wait, but the theater might be the one that's responsible for the duty. So, if the customer didn't know about the dangerous seat, the manufacturer is at fault, but if the manufacturer failed to inspect, perhaps they're liable.

Alternatively, the customer's recovery depends on whether the manufacturer's negligence was sufficient.

Looking back at the options:

D says recover if theater failed to warn. So if the manufacturer didn't warn, the customer can recover.

F: recover only if the theater inspected. So if the theater inspected, then the manufacturer is liable, and the customer can recover.

Wait, but if the manufacturer didn't inspect (because the customer didn't notice), then the manufacturer is at fault, so the customer can recover.

So, the issue is whether the manufacturer's negligence was due to their failure to warn or their failure to inspect.

So, the correct answer options are D and F.

Wait, the question is about whether the customer can recover. So, if the manufacturer made a mistake but the customer didn't notice, the manufacturer is at fault. So the customer can recover if the manufacturer was negligent.

But if the manufacturer failed to inspect, then they're negligent, and the customer can recover.

So, which option is correct?

Looking at option G: "not recover, unless theater made a reasonable inspection." So, only if the theater inspected, because otherwise, the manufacturer's negligence is not a breach of duty.

Wait, but in reality, the duty to inspect is generally there. So, if the customer didn't notice the seat, the manufacturer is at fault. But if the manufacturer had a duty to inspect, and the customer didn't know, then not.

So, perhaps in this case, the customer's recovery depends on whether the manufacturer was negligent, which is their failure to warn or failure to inspect.

Now, looking at the options:

Option F: "recover, only if the theater inspected." So, if the theater inspected, then the manufacturer is at fault for negligence. So the customer can recover.

Option D: "recover, if the theater failed to warn." So, if the manufacturer didn't warn, the customer can recover.

So, the customer can recover if either the manufacturer failed to warn or failed to inspect.

Wait, but the theater's duty to inspect is generally a duty, not a failure to inspect. So, perhaps the customer can recover even without prior inspections, but the manufacturer is responsible for their failure to warn.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible scenarios.

If the customer didn't notice the dangerous seat, the manufacturer is at fault. So, in that case, the customer would recover only if the manufacturer was negligent.

But if the theater had a duty to inspect, then the manufacturer is at fault, so the customer can recover.

So, the key is whether the manufacturer's negligence was because of their failure to inspect.

So, the customer's recovery would depend on whether the theater had a duty to inspect the seat.

The question is, which option is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option F: not recover unless theater inspected. So, if the theater inspected, the manufacturer is liable, allowing recovery.

Option D: recover if theater failed to warn. So, if the manufacturer failed to warn, then the customer can recover.

Which is it?

I think that, in most cases, the duty to inspect is a general duty. So, if the customer didn't notice the seat, the manufacturer is liable, regardless of whether the theater inspected before. But in reality, sometimes the manufacturer is liable even without a prior inspection, but the court might find that the manufacturer's negligence was due to their failure to warn.

Wait, but the question is about the customer's recovery. So, if the manufacturer made a mistake and failed to warn, the customer can recover.

But if the theater had a duty to inspect, then the manufacturer isn't liable. So, the customer's recovery depends on whether the manufacturer was negligent because of their failure to inspect.

So, the right answer would be either F or D.

Wait, but some jurisdictions might require the theater's duty to inspect, so if the customer didn't notice the seat, the manufacturer is liable. But in that case, the customer can recover.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Which option is correct? From what I recall, in personal injury, the plaintiff can recover if they were negligent. The plaintiff's negligence would be either their own (like not knowing the seat was bad) or the manufacturer's (like not warning the customer).

So, the customer's recovery depends on whether the manufacturer's negligence was their fault.

If the manufacturer failed to warn, the customer can recover.

But if the manufacturer had a duty to inspect and didn't, the customer can recover.

But option F says "recover, only if the theater inspected." So, not if they didn't inspect. So, in that case, if the theater inspected, then the manufacturer is at fault, and the customer can recover.

Therefore, the customer's recovery depends on the theater's duty to inspect. So, the correct answer is option F: "not recover, unless the theater inspected."

Wait, no, because the customer can recover if the theater inspected, but not otherwise.

Wait, the question is about the customer's recovery. So, if the theater inspected, the manufacturer is liable, so the customer can recover. If the theater didn't inspect, the manufacturer is not liable, because their failure to warn is the fault. So the customer's recovery would depend on whether the theater inspected.

So, the correct option is F: "recover, only if the theater inspected." So, the customer can't recover unless the theater inspected.

But wait, the question says the customer's seat collapsed, not that they're suing the manufacturer. Wait, no, the question says the customer is suing the theater. So, it's the theater that's at fault or not.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the parties. The customer is suing the theater, but the manufacturer is the one at fault for the accident.

So, the customer's recovery depends on whether the manufacturer's negligence was their fault. If the manufacturer failed to warn, then the customer can recover.

But the question is whether the customer can recover in a personal injury action against the theater.

In some jurisdictions, the plaintiff has a duty to inspect, so if the customer didn't notice the dangerous seat, the manufacturer is at fault. So, the customer can recover only if the manufacturer's negligence was due to their failure to inspect.

Alternatively, the court might hold that the manufacturer is at fault regardless of the inspection, but the court might require the manufacturer to be held liable.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is F: "recover, only if the theater inspected." Because otherwise, the manufacturer is not liable.

Wait, but the customer's recovery could also happen if the manufacturer failed to warn, even without the theater inspecting.

So, now I'm getting even more confused.

Wait, the options:

Option F: "recover, only if the theater inspected." So, unless they inspected, the customer can't recover.

But that's not correct because the manufacturer could be at fault if they failed to warn, regardless of the theater's inspection.

Wait, but perhaps the theater's duty to inspect is a general duty, so if the customer's seat was unsafe, the manufacturer would be at fault regardless of whether the theater inspected.

But then, the customer's recovery wouldn't depend on the theater inspecting, only on their negligence.

But the options don't have such an option. Let me look again.

Looking at the options, F is: "recover, only if the theater inspected."

Wait, but I think the correct answer is option F. Because, if the theater inspected, then the manufacturer is liable for negligence. If the theater didn't inspect, then the manufacturer isn't liable, so the customer can't recover.

Wait, but that's not correct because the manufacturer's negligence could be their own, not the theater's duty.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: only if the theater failed to warn.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the answer in terms of duty.

The customer's duty to notice the seat was breached. The manufacturer's duty to warn was also breached.

So, the customer can recover if they were negligent. But the question is whether the manufacturer was negligent.

In this case, the manufacturer was negligent in failing to warn, but the customer's failure to notice led to the accident.

But the manufacturer's duty is to warn, so if the customer's failure to warn led directly to the accident, the manufacturer is liable, so the customer can recover.

But if the customer had a duty to inspect and didn't, then the manufacturer is not liable, so the customer can't recover.

Wait, I'm getting back to the same point.

So, the customer's recovery depends on whether the manufacturer was negligent due to their failure to warn or inspect.

If they had a duty to inspect, the manufacturer isn't liable. But the manufacturer's failure to warn is another possible negligence.

So, the correct answer would be that the customer can recover if the manufacturer failed to warn, but only if the manufacturer had a duty to warn.

But the options don't have an option that states "only if the manufacturer inspected".

Wait, option F: "recover, only if the theater inspected." So, only if the theater inspected the seat.

Alternatively, the customer's recovery could happen if the manufacturer failed to warn, regardless of the theater's duty to inspect.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because if the theater didn't inspect, the manufacturer is not liable, so the customer can't recover. If the theater inspected, then the manufacturer is at fault.

So, the customer can only recover if the theater inspected. Thus, the correct answer is F: "recover, only if the theater inspected."

Wait, but that's not correct because the manufacturer's negligence (failure to warn) could be their own fault, regardless of the theater's duty.

Hmm, perhaps I need to go back to the basics.

The primary duty of the theater is to inspect the seat to prevent accidents. If the customer didn't notice the dangerous seat, the manufacturer is at fault for not warning, even without the theater inspecting.

But the question is whether the customer can recover. So if the manufacturer failed to warn, the customer can recover.

But if the theater inspected, even if there was a breach of duty, the manufacturer is liable.

Wait, but the court would decide whether the manufacturer's negligence was their own or the theater's.

So, in the options, the correct answer would be F: "recover, only if the theater inspected."

Because the customer's recovery hinges on the theater inspecting the seat, which is their duty. So, if the theater inspected, then the manufacturer is liable because of the manufacturer's failure to warn. Thus, the customer can recover.

If the theater didn't inspect, then the manufacturer isn't liable, so the customer can't recover.

So, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The customer's recovery in a personal injury action against the theater depends on whether the manufacturer was negligent in their failure to warn or inspect the seat. If the customer's failure to notice the dangerous seat breached their duty to inspect, the manufacturer is at fault. However, if the manufacturer had a duty to inspect (which is generally the case), the customer cannot recover unless the theater inspected the seat. 

Option F states, "recover, only if the theater inspected." This aligns with the reasoning that the customer's recovery depends on the theater's duty to inspect the seat. If the theater inspected, the manufacturer is liable for negligence, allowing the customer to recover. If the theater did not inspect, the manufacturer is not liable, and the customer cannot recover.
