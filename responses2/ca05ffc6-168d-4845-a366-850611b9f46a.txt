Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: If g(x) equals f(-x) for all real numbers x, and if the point (3, 2) is on the graph of g, which of the following points must be on the graph of f? The options are A through J, each with different x and y pairs.

Hmm. Alright, so I remember that when you have a function transformation, especially with negative signs inside the function, it affects the graph's reflection. So, let's think about what g(x) = f(-x) really means.

I think this is a reflection of the graph of f over the y-axis. Because f(-x) is like flipping the graph over the y-axis. So, if I have a point (a, b) on the graph of f, then after reflecting over the y-axis, the point (-a, b) would be on the graph of g. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If g(x) is f(-x), then for any x, g(x) is the same as f evaluated at -x. So, if (a, b) is on f, then f(a) = b. Then, g(a) would be f(-a). But wait, that doesn't directly give the relation between (a, b) and (c, d) on the graphs of f and g. Let me try to connect the two.

Suppose (c, d) is a point on g. That means g(c) = d. But g(c) is equal to f(-c). So, d = f(-c). But since (c, d) is on g, and we're looking for points on f, let's see. If (c, d) is on g, then f(-c) = d. So, that would mean that on the graph of f, the point (-c, d) must lie, because f(-c) is d. So, for every point (c, d) on g, the corresponding point on f is (-c, d).

Wait, that makes sense. So, for example, if (3, 2) is on g, then on f, the corresponding point is (-3, 2), because when x is 3 in g, it's f(-3) = 2. So on f, when x is -3, f(-3) is 2, so the point (-3, 2) is on f.

Now the question is, which of the options is such a point? Let's check each option.

Option C is (3, 2). That's the same x as in g, but y is same. But according to our earlier logic, if g is f(-x), then (3, 2) is on g implies (-3, 2) is on f. So option C is (3,2), which is on g, not on f. So C can't be the correct point.

Option A is (-2,3). So, for (-2, 3) on g, that would mean that on f, when x is 2, f(2) is 3. So the point (2,3) is on f. But none of the options is (2,3) as an option. Let me check the options again. The options are A: (-2,3), B: (2,-3), etc. So, (2,3) is not an option. So option A is not matching any of the given points.

Option D is (-3,-2). Wait, if the point is (-3,-2), then on g, that would mean that f(-(-3))=f(3) = -2. So f(3) is -2. So the point (3, -2) is on f, which is option I. So, if g has (-3,-2), then f has (3,-2). But in the question, we're given that g has (3,2). So, to have (3,2) on g, f must have (-3,2) on f. But the options don't have (-3,2) as an option, except for option H, which is (-3, 2). Wait, let me check:

Option H is (-3, 2). So, if that's on f, then on g, when x is -3, g(-3) is f(-(-3))=f(3). So g(-3) = f(3). But since (3,2) is on g, that means g(3) = 2. So f(3) must be 2, which would mean that (3,2) is on f. But the question is asking which must be on f given that (3,2) is on g. So the point on f is (-3,2), which is option H. Because when x is 3, on g, it's f(-3) = 2, so on f, x is -3. So the point is (-3,2), which is option H.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think again about the mapping. If (x, y) is on g, then (y, x) is on f? No, wait, no. Because g(x) = f(-x), so for any x, g(x) is f(-x). So, when x is 3, g(3) = f(-3) = 2. So, that means at x = -3, f(-3) is 2, so ( -3, 2 ) is on f. So, the correct point is (-3,2), which is option H.

Looking back at the options, option H is (-3,2). So that's the correct answer. The other options don't match because they either have the same x and y values, or different x but not the correct y. So, the right answer is option H.
</think>

The function \( g(x) = f(-x) \) implies that the graph of \( f \) is a reflection of \( g \) over the y-axis. If \( (3, 2) \) is on \( g \), then for \( g(3) = 2 \), we have \( f(-3) = 2 \). This means the point \( (-3, 2) \) must be on \( f \). Among the options, \( (-3, 2) \) corresponds to option H.
