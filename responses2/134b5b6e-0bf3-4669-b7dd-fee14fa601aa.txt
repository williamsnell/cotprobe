Okay, so I have this question about what near-monies are. Hmm, I remember that near-monies are related to trading, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think. Near-monies probably have to do with assets that are easy to trade but aren't as liquid as others. 

Wait, I remember something about near-monies being physical assets. Like if someone has gold, it's a near-monny because you can trade it easily without waiting too long. But I'm not sure if that's correct because sometimes digital assets or certain financial instruments are considered near-monies too.

Looking at the options, option G says near-monies are assets that can be quickly converted into currency or demand deposits. That rings a bell. For example, if you own some real estate, you can sell it for cash, which would count as near-monies. Or if you own a stock, you can buy it for a price and sell it later, which is also near-monies.

Option C was about commodities for barter, which is another type, but I think that's more about barter systems rather than just asset trading. Option F is digital currencies, but those are more secure but still considered near-monies because you can buy them with your currency. 

Option A is about physical currencies, which are definitely near-monies, but I think near-monies include more than just currencies because they could also be other assets. So A might be too narrow.

Option B is long-term bonds, which I don't think are near-monies. They're more like long-term financial instruments, not necessarily assets you trade.

Option D is about precious metals, which are a subset of near-monies. So D is correct but not comprehensive.

Option E is ownership in real estate, which is similar to G. So E is also correct.

Wait, the question is asking for an example, so perhaps the best answer is G, because it's more general and fits the idea of being quicklyconvertible. Alternatively, E is also correct, but G is broader.

I think I'm between G and E. Let me check definitions. Near-monies are assets that can be quickly converted into another asset or used for trading. So real estate can be sold for cash, so E is correct. Real estate ownership is an example, which would mean option E is correct. Similarly, G would be correct as well. But the question is about what is meant by near-monies, so which one is the best answer?

Looking back, I think near-monies refers to assets that can be easily converted. So options G and E both fit, but E is more specific to real estate. However, the question doesn't specify which, but the options are separate. So the correct answer is either G or E. But I think in the context of trading, real estate is a common example of near-monies. So E is a correct answer.

Wait, the question is about what is meant by near-monies. So I think the best answer is E: Ownership stakes in real estate. Because it's a specific example of near-monies. However, G is also correct because it's a broader category. 

Alternatively, some sources say that near-monies are assets that are easy to trade, so real estate is a good example. So E is the right answer.

Wait, but the question is more about the definition. Let me think again. Near-monies are assets that can be quickly converted into currency or demanded deposits. So real estate can be sold for cash, so E fits. So E is the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: Ownership stakes in real estate. Near-monies are assets that can be quickly converted into currency or demand deposits, such as real estate, which can be sold for cash.
