Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the median international income as of 2020. I'm a bit confused because I don't know much about international income statistics, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the median is the middle value when all the numbers are arranged in order. So, if I can list some countries and their international incomes, I might be able to find the median.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact figures. I think the income can vary a lot depending on the country and the year. I know that some countries have very high incomes, like in the Middle East or Africa, while others might have lower incomes.

I'm trying to recall if there's a commonly cited figure for the world's average international income. Oh right, some sources mention that the global median international income is around $25,000. That sounds familiar because it's a middle pointâ€”so half of countries have more than $25k, and half have less.

Looking at the options given: 
A: $300 (probably too low)
B: $15,000 (maybe too low for median)
C: $1,000 (too low)
D: $10,000 (still low)
E: $40,000 (higher than I thought)
F: $30,000 (close to the median)
G: $20,000 (close to the lower end of the median)
H: $25,000 (that's the one I thought about)
I: $50,000 (higher than the median)
J: $5,000 (too low)

So, the correct answer should be H: $25,000. That makes sense because it's the median point. I don't think the median is the average, which would be different, but given the options, $25k is the most probable median.

The correct answer is H: $25,000. This is the median international income, representing the middle value when incomes are ordered. 

Answer: H
