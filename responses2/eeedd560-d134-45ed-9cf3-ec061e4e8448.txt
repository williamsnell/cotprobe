Okay, so I've got this multiple choice question in front of me about economics, specifically about the demand and supply of loanable funds. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I remember that loanable funds refer to the money that people can borrow and lend between savers and investors. So the question is asking which statement is true among the options from A to I.

Let's look at each option one by one. I'll try to recall what each economic concept means.

Option A: The demand for loanable funds consists of savers. Wait, I think that's not right. Because the demand for loanable funds comes from both savers and investors. Savers hold money for future use, and investors (like businesses and individuals) need funds for investments. So A says only savers, which would be incorrect.

Option B: Real GDP is the sum of the money supply and the velocity of money. I'm trying to remember the equation here. I think the correct equation is Real GDP = Velocity × Money supply / Price level. But wait, isn't the formula Real GDP = (Velocity × Money supply) / Price level? Or maybe it's Real GDP = (Money supply × Velocity) / Price level. Oh wait, the formula is Real GDP = Money supply × Velocity / Price level. So B says it's the sum of money supply and velocity. That doesn't sound right. So B is probably false.

Option C: The supply of loanable funds is solely determined by the central bank's policies. No, the supply is actually determined by factors like the money supply, which is influenced by the central bank, and also by the public's desire for money. So the central bank's policies influence the supply, but it's not the only factor. Therefore, C is incorrect.

Option D: Dollars earned today have more purchasing power than dollars earned a year from today. Wait, that's the concept of inflation. If a year passes, the value of money decreases. So dollars earned a year later have less purchasing power. So D is false.

Option E: The velocity of money is the speed at which the stock market indices change. Hmm, not sure about this. Velocity is more about how often money is used. If the stock market changes a lot, maybe velocity is high, but I'm not certain if this is how velocity is measured. Wait, velocity is calculated as M*V=P*Y, where M is money supply, V is velocity. So velocity is a measure of how active the money supply is, not the rate of change of the market. So E might be incorrect.

Option F: The demand for loanable funds is entirely driven by government borrowing. No, the demand is driven by both savers and investors. Government borrowing is part of the demand, but so is private sector borrowing. So F is false.

Option G: Purchasing power parity ensures that dollars have the same value across all time periods. Yes, purchasing power parity (PPP) is the theory that the exchange rate between currencies should equal the exchange rate adjusted for inflation. So if two countries have the same purchasing power over time, their exchange rates should be equal. So G is true. But let me check the other options.

Option H: The supply of loanable funds consists of investors. No, the supply comes from savers and investors. Wait, no, wait. The supply of loanable funds is a pool of money that people can lend. So this would include savers and investors. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Inflation rates are inversely proportional to the velocity of money at all times. Well, according to the quantity theory of money, M*V = P*Y. So if velocity V increases, and assuming P and Y are constant, M would increase. Inflation would be related to the change in M. But velocity is M/P. So if V is high, and M is high, then perhaps V is inversely proportional to the rate of change of money. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think: If velocity is high, meaning people hold more money, which is tied to inflation. So if V is high, and M increases, then P increases. But the relationship between V and inflation might be more about how the velocity affects the money supply. Alternatively, thinking about the Fisher equation: i = r + 1/2 * velocity, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that V is inversely related to the quantity of money over time—so if velocity increases, the amount of money in circulation has decreased, which relates to inflation. So yes, V and inflation are inversely related. So I is a correct statement.

Wait, but I thought option G was correct. So which two statements are correct?

Looking back, the question asks which statements is true, so only one option can be correct.

Wait, let me reevaluate each option again.

Option G: PPP. So I think that's correct.

Option I: Inflation rates are inversely proportional to velocity at all times. Let's think about it: from the formula M*V = P*Y. If V increases, and assuming M and Y are constant, P would increase, which is inflation. So V is inversely proportional to the rate of change of P, but I'm not sure if it's exactly inversely proportional. Alternatively, the quantity theory says that if V increases, P increases (assuming M is constant), which would be inflation. So V and inflation are directly related. So if velocity increases, inflation tends to increase. So I is saying V is inversely proportional to inflation, which is not correct. So I is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to think again.

The quantity theory of money is M*V = P*Y. So the velocity V is P*Y/M. So if V increases, with M and P and Y staying same, that's not. But if M increases, V might need to decrease for P to stay the same, assuming Y is fixed. So V and P are directly proportional, given M and Y are constant. So V and inflation are directly related. So statements G and I are incorrect, except for G.

Wait, but I'm not so sure about option G. Let me think. Purchasing power parity says that the exchange rate between two currencies is equalized when the two countries have the same expected inflation rates. So yes, PPP ensures that, so G is correct.

So looking back, which options are correct?

Option G: Correct.

Option I: Inflation rates are inversely proportional to velocity at all times. No, that's not right. So the correct true statement is G.

Wait, but I thought another statement was correct. Let me check. The last option is E: The velocity of money is the speed at which the stock market indices change.

Hmm. I'm not sure about that. Velocity is a measure of money velocity, not the rate of change of prices. So E is probably incorrect.

So the only correct statement is G.

To determine the correct statement about the demand and supply of loanable funds, let's analyze each option carefully:

**Option A:** "The demand for loanable funds consists of savers."  
This is incorrect because the demand for loanable funds is driven by both savers and investors (such as businesses and individuals), not just savers.

**Option B:** "Real GDP is the sum of the money supply and the velocity of money."  
This is incorrect. The correct equation is **Real GDP = (Velocity × Money supply) / Price level**, not the sum of money supply and velocity.

**Option C:** "The supply of loanable funds is solely determined by the central bank's policies."  
This is incorrect because the supply of loanable funds is influenced by factors other than the central bank's policies, such as the public's desire for money and the money supply.

**Option D:** "Dollars earned today have more purchasing power than dollars earned a year from today."  
This is incorrect. The purchasing power of dollars decreases over time due to inflation, meaning dollars earned a year from now have less purchasing power.

**Option E:** "The velocity of money is the speed at which the stock market indices change."  
This is incorrect. The velocity of money is a measure of how often money is used, not the speed of market changes.

**Option F:** "The demand for loanable funds is entirely driven by government borrowing."  
This is incorrect because the demand for loanable funds is driven by both government borrowing and private sector borrowing.

**Option G:** "Purchasing power parity ensures that dollars have the same value across all time periods."  
This is correct. Purchasing power parity (PPP) states that the exchange rate between currencies should equalize their purchasing power, assuming the same inflation rates.

**Option H:** "The supply of loanable funds consists of investors."  
This is incorrect because the supply of loanable funds includes both savers and investors.

**Option I:** "Inflation rates are inversely proportional to the velocity of money at all times."  
This is incorrect. From the quantity theory of money, **Real GDP = (Velocity × Money supply) / Price level**, showing a direct relationship between velocity and inflation.

The only correct statement is **G**. 

**ANSWER: G**
