Okay, so I've got this problem here: there are 10 people, each with one of three different eye colors. I need to figure out the minimum number of people who must have the same eye color. Hmm, let me think.

This sounds like a pigeonhole principle problem. The pigeonhole principle is where if you have more items than containers, at least one container must hold more than one item. So, applying that here, we have 10 people (items) and 3 eye colors (containers). 

Wait, but the question is about the minimum number that must share the same color. So, we want the smallest possible maximum. How does that work?

I remember that to find the minimum maximum, you divide the total number by the number of containers. So, 10 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 10 ÷ 3 is approximately 3.333. But since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round up. So, 4 people must share the same eye color. Because if each color had at most 3 people, that would only account for 9 people (3×3=9), but we have 10, so one more person must go into one of the colors, making it 4.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Suppose we try to distribute the 10 people as evenly as possible across the three eye colors. Let's see: 3, 3, 4. Because 3+3+4=10. So, in this case, there are two colors with 3 people each and one with 4. So, the maximum number of people with the same eye color is 4. That would be the minimum maximum.

So, the answer would be 4, which is option A. But hold on, let me double-check. If I try to have 3 people in each color, 3×3=9, which is 1 less than 10. So, that leaves one more person, who must go into one of the colors, making it 4. So yes, the minimum number that must share the same color is 4. So the answer is A.

The minimum number of people with the same eye color is determined by dividing the total number of people (10) by the number of eye colors (3). Using the pigeonhole principle, this gives a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 1. This means at least one color must have 4 people (3 + 1). Thus, the answer is **A: 4**.
