Okay, so I have this genetics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals. Hmm.

Wait, the parents are AaBbCc each. So each parent has two copies of each gene, right? Because Aa is a diploid, so each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So when you do a cross between two AaBbCc parents, the offspring will have different combinations of alleles for each gene.

Let me break it down for each gene. For each gene, the parents are Aa and Aa. So when two Aa parents mate, what are the possible gametes? Each gamete has a 50% chance of giving A or a. So the possible gamete types are AA, Aa, and aa. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Aa is a diploid. So each gamete can have either A or a, but since they are from a diploid, each gamete can be AA (if both alleles are A), Aa (if one A and one a), or aa (if both are a). 

Wait, but when you have Aa being crossed, the possible gametes are A (50% chance) and a (50% chance). So each parent can produce AA (25%), Aa (50%), or aa (25%) gametes. Wait, no. Wait, for two Aa parents, the possible combinations when they produce gametes are:

Parent 1: A (50%) and a (50%)
Parent 2: A (50%) and a (50%)

So the gamete possibilities are:

- From Parent 1: A, 50% chance; Parent 2: A, 50%. So gamete AA (25% chance) because both gametes are A.
- A and a: 50% from each parent. So 50% * 50% = 25% chance for Aa.
- a and a: 25% chance.

Wait, but that's the gamete composition. Each gamete's copy is one allele. So when two Aa parents produce gametes, the possible gamete types are AA (25%), Aa (50%), and aa (25%). So the parents are AaBbCc, so when they cross, each gene is independent, so each gene's allele distribution is independent.

So for the A gene, each parent has Aa, so each gamete has a 50% chance of A or a. So the probability of an offspring having AA is (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Similarly, aa is 1/4, and Aa is 1/2.

Same applies to the B and C genes. Each parent is Bb and Cc. So for each gene, the possible offspring alleles are:

For A: 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa.

Same for B and C. So the problem is asking what's the probability of having AABBCC as a genotype.

Wait, the question says AABBCC individuals. So each gene must be either A or a, B or b, and C or c. So for each gene, the parent can contribute either the dominant or recessive allele.

So the probability of each gene's contribution:

For gene A:

Parent 1 is Aa, parent 2 is Aa.

Possible gametes for A:

Parent 1: A (50%), a (50%).

Parent 2: A (50%), a (50%).

So the possible combinations for the offspring's gamete for A:

- A from both: 50% * 50% = 25%.
- A from parent 1 and a from parent 2: 50% * 50% = 25%.
- a from parent 1 and A from parent 2: 50% * 50% = 25%.
- a from both: 50% * 50% = 25%.

Wait, the gamete for A in the offspring would be either AA, Aa, or aa, each with probability 25%, 50%, 25%. Wait, no. Wait, each gamete is one allele, so the gamete's genotype is either AA, Aa, or aa. So the probabilities are 25% for each.

Wait, no, wait. Each gamete's contribution is one allele. So the chance of the gamete being AA is (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.25, same for aa (0.25), and Aa (0.5 * 0.5 * 2) = 0.5. Because for each parent, the gamete has 50% chance of A and 50% chance of a. So the chance of the gamete from parent 1 being A and parent 2 being a is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Same for the gamete being a from parent 1 and A from parent 2.

So the probability of each gamete being AA is 0.25, Aa is 0.5, and aa is 0.25.

But wait, when you're looking at the genotype, the chance of having AA is (0.25) * (0.25) = 0.0625? No, wait, no. Because each gamete is one allele, the chance of a particular genotype is the product of each parent's gamete. So for AABBCC, each gene must be contributed in a way that gives the correct genotype.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think differently.

Each gene is independent, so the probability of each gene's contribution is the product of the probabilities for each gene.

So for the A gene: each parent contributes either A or a, each with 50% chance. The probability that the offspring has A from each parent is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 chance for AA.

Wait, no. Wait, the gamete's contribution for A is either A or a. So the probability that the offspring has A (either A from both parents, A from one and a from the other, or a from both) is 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the chance that the offspring has aa is (0.5 * 0.5) for each parent, so 0.25. The chance of having A is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. So, the chance of having AA is (0.5 * 0.5) = 0.25. Because both parents contribute A.

So for each gene, the probability that the offspring has A is 0.75, and a is 0.25.

Wait, no. Wait, for each gene, the offspring's genotype is determined by the parents' gametes. So for each gene, the parent is Aa, so the gamete can be A (50%) or a (50%). So the possible offspring's alleles are A and a.

So the chance of the offspring having AA is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The chance of Aa is 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5. The chance of aa is 0.25.

So each gene has 0.25 for AA, 0.5 for Aa, 0.25 for aa.

Same for B and C genes.

Now, the question is about AABBCC. So for each gene, the offspring must have A (or a), B (or b), and C (or c). So each gene must provide the correct allele.

So the probability for A is 0.25 (A), B is 0.25 (B), and C is 0.25 (C). So the combined probability is 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 = (0.25)^3 = 1/64.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the parents are AaBbCc, so each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So each gene's contribution is independent. So the probability of each gene's correct allele is the product of the probabilities for each gene.

Wait, no. Because for each gene, the parents are Aa, so the chance of each gamete being A is 50%, and a is 50%. So the chance for the offspring to have AA is 0.25, Aa is 0.5, aa is 0.25.

So for each gene, the correct allele is either A or a, same for B and C. So for each gene, the chance of being correct is 0.25 (A) + 0.25 (a) = 0.5. Wait, no. Because the correct genotype is either AA, Aa, or aa. The probability of having a correct genotype (A) is 0.75. So each gene has a 0.75 chance of being correct.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the correct genotype. So for each gene, the chance that the offspring has A is 0.75 (either AA or Aa), and the chance of a is 0.25 (aa). So the chance that the genotype is correct (i.e., A in the A gene) is 0.75.

Wait, no. Wait, the correct genotype is either AA, Aa, or aa. But the question is about having the correct allele for each gene, which is not the same as having the correct genotype. Wait, no. The question says "AABBCC individuals", which means that each gene must be either A or a, B or b, C or c. So for each gene, the offspring must have either the dominant or recessive allele.

So for each gene, the chance of having the correct allele (either A or a) is 0.75 (A) or 0.25 (a). Wait, no: the correct alleles are either A or a. So for each gene, the correct allele is either A or a, with probabilities 0.75 and 0.25, respectively. So the chance for each gene is 0.75.

So the probability for each gene is 0.75. Since the genes are independent, the overall probability is (0.75)^3 = (3/4)^3 = 27/64. But wait, wait, no. Because the parents are AaBbCc, so each gene is independent. 

Wait, no, that's correct. Each gene's contribution is independent. So each gene's correct allele is 0.75 (either A or a), so the chance that all three correct alleles are present is 0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.421875, which is 27/64.

Wait, but the options don't include 27/64. The options are 1/4, 1/512, 1/1024, etc. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me consider the possibilities for each gene.

Each parent is AaBbCc, and the other is the same. So in each gene, the parents are Aa. So when crossed, the possible gametes are AA (25%), Aa (50%), aa (25%). For each gene, the correct allele is A or a, each with 75% chance (since 25% for a).

So the chance of each gene being correct (for A, which is either A or a) is 0.75. So the probability of having the correct genotype for each gene is 0.75.

Since each gene is independent, the total probability is (0.75)^3. Let's compute that.

(3/4)^3 = 27/64. So the probability is 27/64. But looking at the options, I don't see 27/64.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

A: 1.0/4 → 0.25

B: 1.0/512 → ~0.00195

C: 1.0/1024 → ~0.000976

D: 1.0/32 → ~0.03125

E: 1.0/2 → 0.5

F: 1.0/64 → ~0.015625

G: 1.0/8 → 0.125

H: 1.0/16 → 0.0625

I: 1.0/128 → ~0.0078125

J: 1.0/256 → ~0.00390625

Wait, so 27/64 is approximately 0.421875, which is about 0.42 or 42.19%. None of the options match that. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach. Each parent is AaBbCc. So each gamete for each gene is 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa.

In the offspring, each gene is determined by the gametes from each parent. So the chance that the offspring has A is 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75 (since A can come from AA, Aa, or aA, but that's the same as A). Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, for each gene, the chance that the offspring has A is 0.75 (either AA, Aa, or Aa again? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the gamete from each parent is either A or a. So the offspring's gamete for gene A is either A (from both parents: A and A, or A and a, or a and A) or a (from a and a). So the chance of the gamete being A is 0.25 (A from each parent) + 0.5 (A from one, a from the other) + 0.25 (a from each) → 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 1.0. Wait, no, that's not right. The gamete is one allele, so the chance of it being A is 0.5 (since each parent has 50% chance of contributing A or a). So the chance of the gamete being A is 0.5, and a is 0.5.

Wait, that's different. Because each parent contributes either A or a. The gamete's allele is A with 50% and a with 50%. So for each gene, the chance of being A is 0.5, and a is 0.5. So the chance that the offspring has A (either AA, Aa, or Aa again) is 0.5, but since the question is about having the correct genotype, which is either AA, Aa, or aa. But wait, the correct genotype is either A or a. So the chance that the genotype is A (either AA or Aa) is 0.5.

Wait, so for each gene, the chance of having the correct allele (A or a) is 0.5. So for three genes, each with 0.5 chance, the total probability is (0.5)^3 = 1/8. That's 0.125, which is 1/8. Looking at the options, H is 1.0/16, which is 0.0625, and G is 1.0/8, which is 0.125.

Wait, that aligns with option G: 1.0/8. So the answer would be G: 1.0/8.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Each gene's parent is Aa. So each parent contributes A or a. The offspring's gamete is either A or a. The chance of A is 0.5, and a is 0.5.

So the correct genotype for each gene is either A or a. So the chance that the genotype is correct (having either A or a) is 0.5. Since each gene is independent, the combined probability is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.

So the correct answer should be G: 1/8.

To determine the frequency of AABBCC individuals from a mating of two AaBbCc individuals, we analyze the inheritance of each gene independently. Each parent is AaBbCc, meaning they contribute one allele for each gene. For each gene, the possible gametes are as follows:

- **Gene A**: Each parent contributes either A or a, each with a 50% chance. The offspring can inherit AA (25%), Aa (50%), or aa (25%).
- **Gene B**: Similarly, each parent contributes either B or b, each with a 50% chance.
- **Gene C**: Each parent contributes either C or c, each with a 50% chance.

The genotype AABBCC requires the correct allele for each gene. For each gene, the probability of inheriting the correct allele (A, B, or C) is 50%. Since the genes are independent, the combined probability is:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

Thus, the frequency of AABBCC individuals is \( \frac{1.0}{8} \), which corresponds to option G.
