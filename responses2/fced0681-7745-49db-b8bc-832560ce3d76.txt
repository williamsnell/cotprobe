Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the heat of dilution using some given data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the data given are for ethanol solutions. The question asks for the heat of dilution from more concentrated to more diluted, per mole of ethanol. Wait, wait. Heat of dilution usually refers to how much heat is released or absorbed when you dilute a solution. The formula I remember is ΔH Dilution = (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial)/(n), but I'm not totally sure. Or wait, maybe it's something like the difference in enthalpy divided by moles, but with a sign based on whether it's exothermic or endothermic.

Let me read the data again. The data given are for X(C2H5)5OH at different concentrations: 1/6 mole fraction and 1/10 mole fraction. The heat of solution (ΔH) is given as -4.45 Btu/mole for the 1/6 solution, and -6.66 Btu/mole for the 1/10 solution. Oh wait, wait, the question is about the heat of dilution, which is the heat change when you dilute the solution. So, I think for dilution, the solution's enthalpy change would be the difference between the more dilute solution (lower ΔH?) and the more concentrated one. Or wait, if you dilute a solution, you're adding more solvent, which could either release or absorb heat. So in solution, when you dilute, you're adding more solvent, which lowers the concentration of the solute. For example, if you have a solution that's more concentrated, and you dilute it, the solute concentration goes down.

Wait, the heat of solution (ΔH) is the amount of heat released or absorbed when 1 mole of the solute dissolves in 1 mole of solvent. So when you have a more dilute solution, like 1/6 mole fraction, the solution is less concentrated, meaning the solute is more in the solvent. So the ΔH for the 1/6 solution is -4.45 Btu/mole. For the 1/10 solution, it's -6.66 Btu/mole.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. The heat of solution is the enthalpy change when a solution forms. So if the solution becomes more dilute (more solvent), the solute is more in the solvent. For the 1/6 solution, that's more dilute than the 1/10. So when you make it more dilute, the solution is more dilute. The question is about the heat of dilution, which is the heat change when you go from a more concentrated solution to a more diluted one.

Wait, but wait, the given data are for the more concentrated solutions. Because 1/10 is less concentrated than 1/6. Oh wait no, wait 1/6 is more concentrated than 1/10. Because 1/6 is about 0.166, and 1/10 is 0.1. So the more concentrated is 1/6, the less concentrated is 1/10. So if you dilute from 1/6 to 1/10, you're adding more solvent, making the solution less concentrated.

So the process is: more concentrated (1/6) → less concentrated (1/10). So the solution becomes less concentrated. The heat of dilution is the heat change when the solution is made less concentrated. So the formula for dilution is (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial) divided by n, where n is the number of moles of solute that are added. Wait, no. Alternatively, the heat of dilution is the change in enthalpy when the solution is made less concentrated. So when you dilute a solution, you're adding more solvent, which affects the enthalpy of solution.

Wait, the formula I think is ΔH Dilution = (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial) / n, but wait, maybe it's the other way around. Because when you dilute, you're adding solvent, which can change the enthalpy.

Wait, let's think about the enthalpy change. Suppose the solution is more concentrated. The ΔH is negative, which means the solution is exothermic when it's concentrated. But when you dilute it, the solution becomes less concentrated, so the ΔH for that would be different.

Wait, perhaps the heat of dilution is the difference between the ΔH of the more dilute solution and the more concentrated solution, divided by the moles of solvent added. Or the change in enthalpy when you go from a more concentrated solution to a more dilute one.

Alternatively, the heat of dilution (ΔH Dilution) is the heat change when the solution is made less concentrated. So for a more dilute solution, the enthalpy change would be less negative (or more positive) than the concentrated one. Because adding solvent usually increases the entropy, so perhaps it's exothermic or endothermic?

Wait, but the given data have negative ΔH, meaning that the solution is exothermic when it's more concentrated. So making the solution more dilute would require more heat, perhaps, because the solution becomes less concentrated, which may be endothermic. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Alternatively, the heat of dilution is the difference in enthalpy between the more dilute solution and the more concentrated solution, divided by the number of moles of water added. Or perhaps it's the enthalpy change when you make the solution less concentrated.

Wait, perhaps the formula is: ΔH Dilution = (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial) / n, where n is the moles of water added. Or maybe it's the change in enthalpy divided by the moles of solute.

Alternatively, another approach: when you dilute a solution, the heat of solution is the heat released or absorbed. The more dilute the solution, the more it's less concentrated, so the ΔH for the more dilute solution would be less negative than the more concentrated.

So, the more concentrated solution has ΔH = -4.45 Btu/mol. The less concentrated (diluted) solution has ΔH = -6.66 Btu/mol.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. When the solution is more concentrated, the enthalpy change is -4.45, which is exothermic. So when you dilute, the solution becomes less concentrated. The more dilute solution's ΔH is -6.66 Btu/mol, which is more exothermic (less negative). So the heat of dilution would be the heat released when the solution becomes less concentrated. So the heat of dilution is the difference between the two.

Wait, but wait. The heat of dilution is the heat change when you make the solution less concentrated. So if you start with a concentrated solution (ΔH = -4.45) and end with a less concentrated (ΔH = -6.66), then the change is (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial) = (-6.66) - (-4.45) )= (-6.66 +4.45) = -2.21 Btu/mol.

Wait, that would be the change in enthalpy, but the question is about the heat of dilution. So perhaps that's the heat of dilution, but I'm not sure. Wait, if the solution is more concentrated, and then you dilute it, the more dilute solution has a more negative ΔH (since it's exothermic). So when you make it more dilute, you release more heat (since it's more exothermic). So the heat of dilution would be the negative of that change? Or perhaps the heat released is the negative of the change.

Wait, another angle: the heat of dilution is the heat released when you dilute. So when you start with a concentrated solution (ΔH = -4.45), and end with a dilute solution (ΔH = -6.66), the process releases more heat because the solution becomes less concentrated, leading to a more negative ΔH.

Wait, but that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me get back to the formula. I think the formula for heat of dilution is (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial) / n, where n is the number of moles of solvent added.

Wait, no, maybe it's (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial) divided by the moles of solute that were added. Because when you add more solvent, the solution becomes less concentrated, which affects the enthalpy.

Let's model it. Suppose I have 1 mole of the solute. When I make it more dilute, I add solvent. The number of moles of solute doesn't change, but the total moles of solution (solvent + solute) does.

Wait, but the enthalpy change (ΔH) is per mole of solute. So for the initial solution, per mole, the ΔH is -4.45. For the final solution, per mole, it's -6.66.

Wait, wait, but when you make it less concentrated, you're adding solvent. So the total solute is the same. So the moles of solute (n) remains 1 mole. But the total moles of solution increases.

So the heat of dilution is the change in enthalpy when you add solvent, which may affect the solution's enthalpy.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the heat of solution for the more dilute solution being more negative (since it's exothermic), so when you dilute, the enthalpy of the solution decreases further (more negative) which releases more heat.

Wait, but the problem says "heat of dilution" which is the heat change when you make the solution more dilute. So the initial solution (more concentrated) has a ΔH of -4.45, and the final is -6.66. So the difference is -6.66 - (-4.45) = -2.21. So that's a change of -2.21 Btu/mol.

But wait, what's the sign of the heat of dilution? Because when you make the solution more dilute, you're adding solvent, which could either increase or decrease the enthalpy.

Wait, if the solution is more concentrated, the ΔH is -4.45 (exothermic). When you dilute, the solution is more dilute, so the ΔH is -6.66. So the change is -6.66 - (-4.45) = -2.21. That is, the enthalpy decreases by 2.21 Btu/mol.

Wait, but the question is about the heat of dilution. So, the heat of dilution is the heat released when the solution becomes more dilute. So if you end up with a more dilute solution, the process is exothermic. So the heat of dilution would be negative.

Wait, but let me think again. The heat of dilution is the heat change when you make the solution more dilute. So if the solution becomes more dilute, the enthalpy change is more negative. So the process releases more heat, so it's exothermic.

So the heat released when you make the solution more dilute is (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial) = (-6.66) - (-4.45) = -2.21 Btu/mol. But wait, a negative would mean the process is exothermic, releasing heat. So the heat of dilution is negative in this case.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the heat of dilution is the heat change when you make the solution more dilute. So in this case, the more dilute solution has a more negative ΔH. So when you make it more dilute, the solution's ΔH becomes more negative, meaning it's releasing more heat. So the heat of dilution is -2.21 Btu/mol.

Wait, but the options don't have -2.21. Oh wait, looking back, option E is -2.21 and option F is +2.21. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but let me make sure I did the calculation right.

ΔH_final is -6.66 Btu/mol.

ΔH_initial is -4.45 Btu/mol.

ΔH Dilution = (ΔH_final - ΔH_initial) = (-6.66) - (-4.45) = (-6.66 +4.45) = (-2.21) Btu/mol.

So the heat of dilution is -2.21 Btu/mol.

Wait, but the question is about the heat of dilution from more concentrated to more diluted. So when you go from a more concentrated to a more dilute solution, the solution's enthalpy decreases (becomes more negative), so the heat of dilution is negative.

So the answer must be E: -2.21 Btu/mole.

To calculate the heat of dilution, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{Dilution}} = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{Final}} - \Delta H_{\text{Initial}}}{n}
\]

where:
- \(\Delta H_{\text{Final}}\) is the enthalpy change of the more dilute solution (\(-6.66 \, \text{Btu/mol}\)),
- \(\Delta H_{\text{Initial}}\) is the enthalpy change of the more concentrated solution (\(-4.45 \, \text{Btu/mol}\)),
- \(n\) is the number of moles of solute.

The calculation is as follows:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{Dilution}} = \frac{-6.66 - (-4.45)}{1} = \frac{-6.66 + 4.45}{1} = -2.21 \, \text{Btu/mol}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that the process is exothermic, meaning heat is released when the solution is made more dilute. Therefore, the heat of dilution is \(-2.21 \, \text{Btu/mol}\).

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**E: \(-2.21 \, \text{Btu/mole}\)**
