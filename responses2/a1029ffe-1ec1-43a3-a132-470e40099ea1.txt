Question:

One problem concerning space flight is the removal of carbon dioxide (CO_2, molecular weight = 44.0 g / mole) emitted by the human body (about 924 g of CO_2 per day). One solution is to react CO_2 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH, molecular weight = 40.0 g / mole) to form water and sodium carbonate (Na_2CO_3, molecular weight = 94 g / mole) according to the followingreation: 2NaOH + CO_2 \ding{217} NaCO_3- + H_2O. How muchNaOHmust be carried on board a space capsule to remove the CO_2 produced by an astronaut on a 10 day flight?

Okay, so I have this problem about removing carbon dioxide from spaceflights, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again. 

The question says that the astronauts on a 10-day flight are emitting about 924 grams of CO₂ each day. They're trying to get rid of that by reacting CO₂ with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to make sodium carbonate and water. The reaction equation given is 2 NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O. 

So the main task is to find out how much NaOH they need to carry on board for the 10-day flight. The options are A to J, each with different kilograms.

First, I think I need to calculate the total CO₂ emitted over the 10 days. Since they emit 924 g per day, over 10 days that's 924 * 10. Let me compute that.

924 *10 is 9240 grams. Oh wait, that's 9.24 kilograms of CO₂. 

Now, looking at the reaction equation, 2 moles of NaOH react with 1 mole of CO₂. So the molar ratio is 2:1. 

I need to find out how many moles of NaOH are needed to react with 9.24 grams of CO₂. 

First, find the moles of CO₂. The molecular weight of CO₂ is 44 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass. 

9240 grams / 44 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 9240 divided by 44. Hmm, 44 times 200 is 8800, right? 9240 minus 8800 is 440. 440 /44 is 10. So total is 200 +10 = 210. So 210 moles of CO₂.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, because the total CO₂ is 9240 grams. 9240 divided by 44 is 9240/44. Let me compute that. 44 times 200 is 8800. 9240-8800 is 440. 440/44 is 10. So total moles is 210 (200 + 10).

But the reaction requires 2 moles of NaOH per 1 mole of CO₂. So the moles of NaOH needed would be 2 * 210 = 420 moles.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check. 

Reaction: 2 NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H2O. So for each mole of CO₂, you need two moles of NaOH.

So 210 moles of CO₂ would require 210 * 2 = 420 moles of NaOH.

Now, I need to find the mass of NaOH in grams. NaOH has a molecular weight of 40 g/mol. So 420 moles * 40 g/mol = 16800 grams. 

Convert grams to kilograms: 16800 /1000 = 16.8 kg. 

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options like F is 14.5, G is 19.6, D is 18.9, etc. Hmmm, 16.8 is option G. But wait, let me think again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait another approach. Let me think about the reaction again. The stoichiometry is 2 moles NaOH per 1 mole CO₂. So 210 moles CO₂ would need 420 moles NaOH. NaOH's molar mass is 40 g/mol, so 420 *40 = 16800 grams = 16.8 kg. 

But the options don't have 16.8 as an option? Let me check the options again. 

Options are:

A:20.5 kg 

B:15.7 kg 

C:22 kg 

D:18.9 kg 

E:21.2 kg 

F:14.5 kg 

G:19.6 kg 

H:16.8 kg 

I:23.4 kg 

J:17.3 kg 

So option G is 19.6 kg, which is different from 16.8. Hmm, so I must have a mistake somewhere. 

Wait, maybe I miscalculated moles of CO₂. Let me recheck that. Total CO₂ is 924 grams per day, over 10 days, that's 924 *10 = 9240 grams. So 9240 /44 is 210 (since 210 *44 = 9240). So that's correct. 

So, 210 moles CO₂, so 420 moles NaOH. 420 *40= 16800 grams, which is 16.8 kg. So the correct option would be G, but wait the options don't have G as the correct one. Wait, the options do have G as 19.6 kg. Wait, did I make a mistake in the stoichiometry?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the calculation again. Let me make a table.

CO₂: 924 g/day *10 days =9240 g.

Molar mass CO₂ =44 g/mol.

Molar mass NaOH=40 g/mol.

Molar ratio: 2 moles NaOH : 1 mole CO₂.

So moles CO₂ = 9240 /44 = 210.

Moles NaOH needed = 2 *210=420.

Mass NaOH (g) =420 *40=16800 g=16.8 kg. 

So the mass required is 16.8 kg. Looking at the options, G is 19.6 kg. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait another thing: perhaps I have the reaction reversed? Let me double-check the reaction equation.

The problem states the reaction as 2NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O. So that's correct. So for every mole of CO₂, you need two moles of NaOH. So no, my calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the CO₂ emitted is 924 g per day, but I should calculate per day and then multiply by 10. Wait, but that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the CO₂ is 924 g per day, but the astronaut is emitting that per day, so over 10 days, it's 924 *10=9240 grams. So that's correct.

Another possible miscalculation: perhaps I should calculate the moles of CO₂ correctly.

Wait, 9240 grams divided by 44 g/mol. Let me compute that more accurately. 44 * 210 = 44*200=8800 +44*10=440 → 9240. So correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 16.8 kg. Wait, checking the options, option G is 19.6 kg. So maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the stoichiometry. Let me think again:

The reaction is 2 moles NaOH → 1 mole CO₂.

So for 1 mole CO₂, 2 moles NaOH are required.

So moles of NaOH needed = 2 moles CO₂ * 2 = 420 moles. So 420 *40=16800g=16.8 kg.

Wait, but this suggests the answer is 16.8 kg. However, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong molecular weight for CO₂. Let me recalculate the molar mass.

CO₂: Carbon is 12 g/mol, oxygen is 16 each. So 12 + 16*2= 12 +32=44 g/mol. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the reaction wrong. Let me read the reaction again.

The reaction written is 2NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O. Wait, but the way the equation is written is a bit confusing. Let me check the products.

Wait, the reaction is written as 2NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the product would be Na₂CO₃ and H2O, but according to the reaction, the CO₂ and NaOH are reacting to form Na₂CO₃ and H2O. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is correct as written. Let me think about the molar ratios again.

2 moles NaOH reacted with 1 mole CO₂. So for each mole of CO₂, 2 moles of NaOH are needed. So for 210 moles of CO₂, 210 *2=420 moles NaOH. So NaOH mass is 420 *40=16800g=16.8kg.

But the options don't have this. So the options might have some typo, but assuming I did everything correctly, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the moles.

Wait, perhaps the oxygen is calculated correctly. Wait, 9240 grams of CO₂. Moles =9240 /44=210. So that's correct.

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass of NaOH. Na is about 23, O is 16, H is 1. So Na is 23, O is 16, NaOH is 23+16+1=40. Correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again about the problem. Am I missing any other factors, like how much is produced per reaction?

Wait, perhaps I should look at the reaction again. The reaction is 2NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O. So for each mole of CO₂, 2 moles of NaOH are needed. So 210 moles CO₂ → 420 moles NaOH. So mass is 420 *40=16800g=16.8 kg.

But the options don't have 16.8. So perhaps the question is about the amount needed per day, or per step? Or perhaps I misread the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is reversed. Let me check the reaction equation again.

The reaction as written is 2NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O. So 2 moles NaOH + 1 mole CO₂ → 1 mole Na₂CO₃ + 1 mole H₂O. That's correct. So the molar ratio is 2:1. So I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the astronaut is emitting CO₂, which is all being removed. So the total NaOH needed is 16.8 kg. But the options don't have that. 

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let's calculate 210 * 2 *40.

Wait, 210 * 2 is 420. 420 *40 is 16800 grams, which is 16.8 kg. So 16.8 kg is correct. But the options are:

A:20.5 kg

B:15.7 kg

C:22 kg

D:18.9 kg

E:21.2 kg

F:14.5 kg

G:19.6 kg

H:16.8 kg

I:23.4 kg

J:17.3 kg.

So option H is 16.8 kg. So according to my calculation, the correct answer would be option H, 16.8 kg. But wait, the options in the problem don't have this. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in determining the total CO₂ emitted. Because the question states that the astronaut emits about 924 g of CO₂ per day. So per day, 924 g. Over a 10-day flight, that's 924 *10 =9240 grams, which is correct.

But let me check if I'm using the right molar masses. Na is 23, O is 16, H is 1. So NaOH is 23+16+1=40 g/mol. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the reaction equation is different, but the question provides it. So no, the reaction is correct.

Wait, is there another way the reaction could be set up? For example, perhaps the reaction is written with NaOH as a reactant. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is written in another way, but I think the given equation is correct for the problem.

So I think the correct answer should be 16.8 kg, which is option H. But looking back, the options are given as:

A:20.5 kg

B:15.7 kg

C:22 kg

D:18.9 kg

E:21.2 kg

F:14.5 kg

G:19.6 kg

H:16.8 kg

I:23.4 kg

J:17.3 kg

So the correct answer is H, 16.8 kg. But looking at the provided options, G is 19.6, which is about twice as much as my calculation. Did I miscalculate the moles of CO₂?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in moles of CO₂. Let me recalculate CO₂ mass.

Total CO₂ =924 g/day *10 days=9240 g. Yes, that's correct.

Molar mass of CO₂ is 44 g/mol. So moles =9240 /44.

Let me compute 9240 divided by 44.

44 * 210 = 9240, so moles =210. So correct.

Hmm, perhaps another mistake. Let me compute 210 *40 = 8400 grams. Wait, 210 *40 is 8400 grams, which is 8.4 kg. Oh wait, that's the mass of NaOH needed. But wait, no: the calculation is 210 *40=8400 grams, which is 8.4 kg. Wait, wait, no.

Wait, 210 moles NaOH: 210 *40 =8400 grams. 8400 grams is 8.4 kg. But that's not matching with my previous calculation. Wait, what's going on here.

Wait, wait, no. I think I've got the mole and grams mixed up. Oh no, no. Let me make it clear. 

Molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol. So 210 moles *40 g/mol =8400 grams =8.4 kg.

Wait, that's a big mistake! Because 210 *40=8400 grams, which is 8.4 kg. But in my earlier calculation, I thought it was 16.8 kg, which is a mistake. Oh no, I see my mistake. Because in the reaction, 2 moles of NaOH are needed for each mole of CO₂. So 210 moles CO₂ requires 210 *2=420 moles NaOH. 420 *40g =16800g=16.8 kg. 

Wait, but wait. If CO₂ is 210 moles, and each requires 2 NaOH, then 420 moles NaOH. 420 *40g =16800g=16.8 kg.

But another approach: 210 moles CO₂, each needs 2 NaOH. So 210 *2=420 NaOH. 420 *40=16800g=16.8 kg. 

But wait, I think I messed up the earlier calculation. So the correct answer is 16.8 kg, which is option H. But looking back at the options provided, the correct answer is option H. So the answer is 16.8 kg, which is option H.

Wait, but in my earlier thinking, I thought 210 moles CO₂, each needs 2 moles NaOH. So 420 moles NaOH needed. 420 *40=16800g=16.8 kg. 

Therefore, the correct option is H:16.8 kg. But in the original options, I see H is 16.8 kg. So the correct answer should be option H. But in the problem statement, the options are:

A:20.5 kg

B:15.7 kg

C:22 kg

D:18.9 kg

E:21.2 kg

F:14.5 kg

G:19.6 kg

H:16.8 kg

I:23.4 kg

J:17.3 kg

So the answer is H, 16.8 kg. But wait, looking back, the problem statement says that the astronaut is emitting about 924 grams per day. So over 10 days, it's 9240 grams. 

Wait, perhaps I should check the reaction again. Is the reaction 2 NaOH + CO₂ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O? Yes.

So the calculation is correct. So the answer is H, 16.8 kg.
</think>

To determine the amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) required to remove 924 grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂) over a 10-day flight, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total CO₂ emitted over 10 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total CO}_2 = 924 \, \text{g/day} \times 10 \, \text{days} = 9240 \, \text{g}
   \]

2. **Find the moles of CO₂:**
   The molar mass of CO₂ is 44 g/mol.
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO}_2 = \frac{9240 \, \text{g}}{44 \, \text{g/mol}} = 210 \, \text{moles}
   \]

3. **Determine the moles of NaOH required:**
   The reaction equation shows a 2:1 molar ratio between NaOH and CO₂. Thus, for 210 moles of CO₂, we need:
   \[
   \text{Moles of NaOH} = 2 \times 210 = 420 \, \text{moles}
   \]

4. **Convert moles of NaOH to grams:**
   The molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol.
   \[
   \text{Mass of NaOH (g)} = 420 \, \text{moles} \times 40 \, \text{g/mol} = 16800 \, \text{g} = 16.8 \, \text{kg}
   \]

5. **Compare with the options:**
   The correct answer is **16.8 kg**, which corresponds to option **H**.
