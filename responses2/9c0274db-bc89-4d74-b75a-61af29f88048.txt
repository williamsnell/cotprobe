Okay, so I've got this question about quantum numbers and electrons in an atom. Let me see if I can work through it.

The question says: A single-electron atom has the electron in the l = 2 state. The number of allowed values of the quantum number m_l is... and then there are options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the quantum numbers describe the state of an electron. The main ones are n, l, m_l, and sometimes m_s. 

Wait, l is the angular momentum quantum number. Oh right, l can take integer values from 0 up to n-1. So for a given n, l can be 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1. So if l is 2, n must be at least 3 because l = n-1. So n is 3 or higher.

Now, m_l is the magnetic quantum number. It determines the orientation of the electron's orbital. The m_l can take integer values from -l to +l, including zero. So for a given l, the number of possible m_l values is 2l + 1. Like, for l = 0, m_l can only be 0. For l = 1, m_l can be -1, 0, +1 (3 values). For l = 2, m_l can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2. That's 5 values.

So the number of allowed values for m_l when l is 2 is 5. Let me think if I'm missing anything. Oh, wait, the question says it's a single-electron atom. But that doesn't change anything because m_l is still determined by l. 

The options are A to J. Let me look at them again. The options are:

A: 8
B:5
C:3
D:2
E:6
F:9
G:4
H:1
I:7
J:0

So the correct answer is B:5. But wait, some of the other options are distractors. For example, someone might confuse m_l with l, but that's not right because m_l is dependent on l.

Wait, another thought: what if the question was about the possible values of l instead of m_l? Oh, but the question is about m_l. So no, that's not it.

So in conclusion, the allowed values of m_l for l=2 are 5. So the correct option is B.

The quantum number \( m_l \) describes the orientation of an electron's orbital and can take integer values from \(-l\) to \(+l\), inclusive. For a given \( l = 2 \), the possible values of \( m_l \) are \(-2, -1, 0, +1, +2\), which totals 5 values. 

Analyzing the options provided:
- \( A: 8 \) is incorrect.
- \( B: 5 \) is correct.
- \( C: 3 \) is incorrect.
- \( D: 2 \) is incorrect.
- \( E: 6 \) is incorrect.
- \( F: 9 \) is incorrect.
- \( G: 4 \) is incorrect.
- \( H: 1 \) is incorrect.
- \( I: 7 \) is incorrect.
- \( J: 0 \) is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is \( B: 5 \).

Answer: B
