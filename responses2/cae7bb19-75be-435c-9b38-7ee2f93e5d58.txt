Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about probability, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about a couple planning to have four children and wants to find the probability they'll have three daughters and one son. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember something about Punnett squares and the probabilities of different genotypes when parents have certain traits. Since the question is about the sex ratio, I think we're dealing with the probability of each child being a daughter or a son, assuming a 1:1 sex ratio. Oh wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the parents are both carriers or if they have a fixed sex ratio.

Wait, the question says a 1:1 sex ratio exists for humans. Oh, wait, that's different. So, perhaps each child has an equal chance of being a boy or a girl. So, each child's gender is independent, right?

So, for each child, the probability of a daughter is 1/2 and a son is 1/2. Since each child is independent, the probability for each combination is (1/2)^4, which is 1/16. Because each child's gender is a separate event.

Now, how many ways can three daughters and one son appear in four children? That's the number of combinations where three are D and one is S. So, the possible arrangements are:

1. D, D, D, S
2. D, D, S, D
3. D, S, D, D
4. S, D, D, D

So that's four different ways. Each of these has a probability of (1/2)^4 = 1/16. So, total probability is 4 * (1/16) = 4/16, which simplifies to 1/4.

Wait, but wait, that's 1/4. Looking at the options, option E is 1/4. But wait, let me think againâ€”could I have made a mistake here.

Another approach: the general formula for the probability of k successes (daughters) in n trials (children) is given by the binomial distribution. So the formula is n choose k * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Here, p is 1/2.

So n=4, k=3.

So 4 choose 3 is 4. Each term is (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1 = (1/8)*(1/2) = 1/16. So 4 * 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when people are talking about children, the genders are determined by the parents' chromosomes. But I think the problem here says to assume a 1:1 sex ratio, so maybe we don't have to worry about that. It's probably assuming that each child has a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl, regardless of the parents' usual ratios. So that supports the 1/16 per child calculation.

So, the probability is 1/4, which is option E. But wait, looking back at the options, E is 1/4. But wait, wait another moment. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 2/5
B: 3/16
C: 3/8
D: 1/6
E: 1/4
F: 1/8
G: 1/5
H: 1/3
I: 1/2
J: 1/16

So option E is 1/4, which is what I calculated. But wait, wait a second. Did I calculate the probability correctly? Let's see: four children. The number of ways to have three daughters and one son is 4. Each way has a probability of (1/2)^4=1/16. So 4 * 1/16 = 1/4. So yes.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've seen answers sometimes being different. For example, if the parents are both female carriers (like Aa), then the probability of a son is higher, but in this question, it's stated that a 1:1 sex ratio exists. So each child is equally likely to be a girl or a boy regardless of the parents.

Another way: The probability of each child being a boy is 1/2, so each has an independent 1/2 chance. The four children are independent, so each combination has (1/2)^4 = 1/16. We need the probability of exactly three daughters and one son.

The number of such combinations is 4 (since the son can be in any one of the four positions). Each has 1/16 chance. So total is 4 * 1/16 = 1/4. So the answer is E: 1/4.

Wait, but wait another thought. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the four children being of four different genders, but the question is about exactly three daughters and one son. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the probability of the first child being a son, and the rest daughters, but I think that's not the case. The question says they plan to have four children, so the order doesn't matter. So the probability is 1/4.

The question asks for the probability of a newly married couple planning to have four children, with three daughters and one son, assuming a 1:1 sex ratio. Each child has a 1/2 chance of being a daughter or a son, and the genders of the children are independent events. 

To calculate the probability, we use the binomial distribution formula:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Where:
- \( n = 4 \) (total number of children),
- \( k = 3 \) (number of daughters),
- \( p = 1/2 \) (probability of a daughter).

First, calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]

Then, compute the probability:

\[
P(3 \text{ daughters}) = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1 = 4 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability of having three daughters and one son is \( \frac{1}{4} \).
