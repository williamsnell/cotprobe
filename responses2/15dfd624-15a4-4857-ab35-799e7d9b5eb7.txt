Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3x minus 4 times (x minus 2) plus 6x minus 8 equals zero. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I think I remember from class that I need to simplify the equation by expanding and combining like terms. 

First, I'll start by distributing the -4 across the (x - 2). So that part becomes -4x plus 8 because negative 4 times x is -4x, and negative 4 times -2 is +8. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the original term is -4(x - 2), so when I distribute that, it's -4 * x, which is -4x, and -4 * (-2) is +8. So that part becomes -4x + 8.

Now the equation looks like this: 3x - 4x +8 +6x -8 = 0. Let me check that: yes, the 3x remains, then the -4x, then +8 from the distribution, then the 6x, and then -8.

Next, I'll combine the like terms. The x terms are 3x, -4x, and 6x. Let me add those together. 3x minus 4x is -x, and then plus 6x. So that's (-x +6x) which is 5x. 

Now the constants: +8 and -8. Those add up to zero. So the equation simplifies to 5x = 0. Oh wait, if 5x equals zero, then x must be zero. So the answer should be option A: 0. 

Wait, wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's plug x=0 back into the original equation to check. 

3*(0) is 0. Then -4*(0 -2) is -4*(-2) which is 8. Then +6*(0) is 0, and -8 is -8. So adding them all: 0 +8 +0 -8 = 0. Yep, that works. So x=0 is definitely the correct answer.

The equation simplifies as follows:
- Distribute the -4: -4(x - 2) becomes -4x + 8.
- Combine like terms: 3x -4x +8 +6x -8 = 5x.
- Set 5x = 0 → x = 0.

**Answer:** A: 0
