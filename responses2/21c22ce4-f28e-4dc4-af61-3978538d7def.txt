Question:

A pharmacist was employed by a drug store. A long-time customer of the drug store presented a prescription to the pharmacist for the medication Clinoril, which was prescribed by her physician to treat her arthritic condition. The pharmacist was in a rush that day because of a backlog of prescriptions to fill, and he misread the customer's prescription. He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: "Take one tablet twice a day. "The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus. If the customer brings a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist, what is his best defense?

Options:

A: The customer did not suffer any injuries due to the medication.
B: The customer did not ask for clarification about the medication.
C: The physician had prescribed the wrong medication.
D: The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.
E: The medication was properly labeled with the correct medication name.
F: It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.
G: The customer should have been aware that the medication was not correct.
H: He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.
I: He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.
J: The customer misread the label on the medication.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this strict liability question. Let me read through the scenario carefully.

So, the pharmacist was employed by a drug store. A long-time customer came in and presented a prescription for Clinoril, which the physician prescribed to treat her arthritis. The pharmacist was in a rush because of a backlog and misread the prescription. He filled her with Clinitest, which is a caustic substance, not for internal use. The customer followed the instructions, took the medication, and suffered from severe stomach and esophagus injuries. The question is, as a strict liability plaintiff, what is his best defense.

Hmm, okay. Strict liability usually refers to cases where the defendant's liability is not tied to the defendant's own conduct, but rather to the harm caused to the plaintiff by the product. So, the common defenses are things like manufacturing liability, failure to label, failure to warn, and negligence.

Looking at the options, option J says the customer misread the label. That's a strong possibility because strict liability often considers the product's labeling. If the label was incorrect, the customer's injury would be based on the wrong medication.

The options are:

A: customer didn't suffer injuries. But the customer did, so A is incorrect.

B: customer didn't ask for clarification. But the customer did follow instructions, so B is wrong.

C: physician prescribed wrong medication. The physician did, so C is out.

D: drug store manufacturer. Strict liability doesn't require the manufacturer to be at fault; it's more about the product. So D is not a defense here.

E: cashier didn't receive money. That's about the seller, which is about liability, not the product.

F: cashier didn't get money. Same as E.

G: customer should have known. But the customer did follow instructions, so G is incorrect.

H: pharmacist not a seller. Again, about the seller, not the product.

I: exercise reasonable care. That's about the pharmacist's actions. Since the customer misread the label, maybe the pharmacist had no reasonable care. Hmm, but in strict liability, the product's fault, not the seller's. So I might not apply here.

J: misread the label. That seems like a solid defense. If the label was incorrect, the customer's injury was a result of the wrong medication, so the label's fault would be on the product side. Therefore, the pharmacist's negligence doesn't affect strict liability.

So, the best defense would be J.

The correct answer is J, as the pharmacist's misreading of the label leads to the customer's injury, which is a result of the incorrect medication. 

Answer: J
