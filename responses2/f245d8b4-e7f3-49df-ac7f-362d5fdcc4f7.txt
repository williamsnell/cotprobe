Question:

Bob writes down a number between 1 and 1,000. Mary must identify that number by asking "yes/no" questions of Bob. Mary knows that Bob always tells the truth. If Mary uses an optimal strategy, then she will determine the answer at the end of exactly how many questions in the worst case?

Options:

A: 250
B: 20
C: 500
D: 100
E: 2
F: 1,000
G: 999
H: 50
I: 10

Okay, so I have this problem where Bob thinks of a number between 1 and 1000, and Mary has to figure it out by asking yes/no questions. I remember something about information theory and binary search here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking about the worst-case scenario, meaning the maximum number of questions Mary would need. Since each yes/no question gives one bit of information, I think the key is to determine how much information is needed to identify one number out of 1000 possibilities.

The formula I recall is something like log base 2 of the number of possibilities. So, log2(1000) would give the minimum number of bits needed. Let me calculate that. I know that 2^10 is 1024, which is just over 1000. So log2(1000) is a little less than 10. But wait, that's the exact number of bits needed. But since each question is a yes/no, each question gives one bit.

So, the maximum number of questions needed would be the ceiling of log2(1000). Since log2(1000) is approximately 9.965, the ceiling is 10. So, Mary would need up to 10 questions to determine the number in the worst case.

Looking at the options, option I is 10. So the answer should be I:10.

The minimum number of yes/no questions needed to determine a number between 1 and 1000 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(1000), which is 10. Thus, the worst-case scenario requires exactly 10 questions.

Answer: I:10
