Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question. Let me read it carefully. The question is about businesses' characteristics in society and their potential impacts. The sentence given is: "Businesses have _____ within society and have the potential to provide a ____ to society while ____ has the potential to inflict enormous harm on individuals, communities and the environment." I need to pick the correct options from A to J.

Hmm, let's break it down. The first blank is about what businesses have in terms of societal contributions. The options are things like little power, minimal power, huge power, significant power, little power, significant power, etc. I remember from previous reading that businesses can have a lot of power because they're huge entities. So "huge power" seems right. 

The second part is about what businesses can provide. The options given are "Small contribution," "No contribution," "Major contribution," "Significant contribution," "No contribution," etc. I think businesses can make a big difference. Like, they can have major impact in areas like economic growth, environment, etc. So "major contribution" would fit here.

Now, the third part is about what has the potential to cause harm. The options are "Business malpractice," "Business ethics," "Corporate social responsibility," etc. Oh, I remember that businesses can have corporate social responsibility. They can be held accountable for environmental issues, social issues, etc. Plus, they have a responsibility to make a positive impact. So "Corporate social responsibility" seems correct.

Looking at the options, let me check each one. The first part is about what they have in society. The choices are: A) Little, B) Minimal, C) Huge, D) Huge, E) Little, F) Significant, G) Little, H) Minimal, I) Significant, J) Huge.

Hmmm. I thought businesses have a lot of power, so Huge is correct. So options C, D, E, F, I, J are left. Now the second part: what they provide. The options are Small, No, Major, Significant, No, etc. So Major is correct, as businesses can make a major contribution. So looking at the options, C, D, E, F, I, J. But looking for the third part: business social responsibility.

Looking at the options again. The third part is "Corporate social responsibility." So let's see which options have that. Let's check each option.

Option C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility. Yes, that matches what I thought.

Option D: Huge power, No contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No contribution doesn't seem right. I think businesses do contribute positively.

Wait, let me make sure. The question is about the "potential to provide a contribution" and "potential to inflict harm." So for the second part, the option should be a positive contribution. So "Major contribution" is correct, so looking at the options, only C and D have that.

So in the options, C and D have the second part as "No contribution" or "Major." So I think C is correct.

Wait, let me look at the options again. For each option, the first part is what they have, the second is what they provide, the third is what they can do harm.

Option C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility. That fits because businesses have a lot of power, make a small contribution, and have social responsibility.

Wait, but I think businesses can make a significant contribution. So if the first part is 'huge power' and the second is 'significant contribution,' then the options would have to have significant as the second part. So looking at the options:

Option H: Minimal power, Significant contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No, because power is minimal. Option I: Significant power, Minor contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No, same issue. Option G: Little power, Major contribution, Business ethics. No, because ethics isn't the right term.

Wait, maybe I should think again.

So the first blank: what do businesses have in terms of societal power? Huge power makes sense because they're big. So options C and D have Huge power.

Second blank: what do they provide? Major contribution. So options C and D.

Third part: what can cause harm? Corporate social responsibility. So, options C and D have that.

Option C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

Wait, if I have to choose, the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, businesses can have significant impact, so maybe the second part should be significant. But looking at the options, only option H says significant power, but the power is minimal. Let me think again.

Wait, the options for the second part are: A) Minimal, B) No, C) Significant, D) No, E) Minimal, F) Significant, G) Minimal, H) Significant, I) Significant, J) Significant.

So, the second part should be significant. So options that have that are F, H, I, J.

So combining with the first part's 'huge power' (C, D), the options that fit are C and D. Now the third part is 'Corporate social responsibility.' Only options C and D have that.

So, the correct answer is C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility. Wait, but earlier I thought the second part should be significant. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider what each term means.

H "Business ethics" is a term that refers to the moral behavior of a business, but the question is about what the companies have the potential to provide. So, if the second part is 'significant contribution,' then the correct option would be F. But F says 'Significant power'â€”wait, no, F's second part is 'Significant power.' That doesn't match because power is the first part, which should be 'huge power.'

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Another approach: the options for the second part are:

A) Minimal power
B) No contribution
C) Significant
D) No contribution
E) Minimal
F) Significant
G) Minimal
H) Significant
I) Significant
J) Significant

So the second part should be something that represents a positive contribution, like significant. So options F, H, I, J.

Now, the first part: Huge power (C, D).

Third part: Corporate social responsibility.

So the correct options would be those where the second part is significant and the third is corporate social responsibility. So options F, H, I, J.

So among these, the first part should be 'huge power' (C, D). So looking for options F, H, I, J.

So, which one of F, H, I, J has the third part as 'Corporate social responsibility'? Let's see.

Option F: Significant power, Major contribution, Business malpractice. No.

Option H: Significant power, Minor contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No, because minor contribution.

Option I: Significant power, Minor contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No.

Option J: Huge power, Major contribution, Business malpractice. No, because first part is huge, not significant.

Wait, I'm getting confused because the first part has to be "huge power," so only options C and D are candidates.

So among C and D, the second part must be significant, and the third must be corporate social responsibility.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

Option D: Huge power, No contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

So option C's second part is Significant, not Small. So that can't be the correct answer because the second part is supposed to be significant.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

The question is about the potential of businesses to do what? So the first blank is about their power, the second about their contribution, the third about their harm.

The correct answer is C: Huge power, Significant contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

Wait, but I thought the second part should be significant. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what each part refers to.

First blank: What do businesses have in terms of societal power? Huge. So C and D.

Second blank: What do businesses provide? They can provide a major contribution. So options C and D.

Third blank: What are their obligations to inflict harm? Corporate social responsibility. So options C and D.

So the correct answer should be C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility. Wait, but if the second part is "Small contribution," that's not correct because I thought they make a significant contribution.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Maybe I made a mistake in the second part. Let me check.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

So "Small contribution" is the second part, but I think business can make a significant contribution. So perhaps the correct answer is not C.

Wait, perhaps the second part is about the kind of contribution. For example, significant, major, etc. So the options for the second part are: A) Minimal, B) No, C) Significant, D) No, E) Minimal, F) Significant, G) Minimal, H) Significant, I) Significant, J) Significant.

So significant would be F, H, I, J.

And the third part is "Corporate social responsibility." So options F, H, I, J.

So the correct answer is one of these where the third part is "Corporate social responsibility."

So option F: Significant power, Major contribution, Business malpractice. No.

Option H: Significant power, Minor contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No.

Option I: Significant power, Minor contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No.

Option J: Huge power, Major contribution, Business malpractice. No.

Wait, none of these options have the third part as "Corporate social responsibility." Only option C and D have that.

But the first part of option C is "Huge power," which is correct. So the options that fit are C and D.

So between C and D, the second part is the issue. If the second part is "Significant contribution," then options F, H, I, J. But first part is "Huge power" only.

So the correct answer must have all three correct. So the first part is "Huge power," second part is "Significant contribution," third part is "Corporate social responsibility."

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have all three. Let me check each option again.

Option C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

No, second part is Small.

Option D: Huge power, No contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

No, second part is No.

Option F: Significant power, Major contribution, Business malpractice.

No, first part is Significant, not huge.

Option H: Significant power, Minor contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

No, first part is significant, not huge.

Option I: Significant power, Minor contribution, Corporate social responsibility.

No, same as H.

Option J: Huge power, Major contribution, Business malpractice.

No, third part is Business malpractice.

So none of the options have all three correct. Wait, but the options list only certain ones. So perhaps the correct answer is C, assuming that the second part is incorrect, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the first part: huge power, correct.

Second part: significant contribution, correct.

Third part: Corporate social responsibility, correct.

So the correct answer is C. Because it's the only option with Huge power as the first part, and the third part as Corporate social responsibility.

Wait, but the second part is "Small contribution" in option C, which is wrong. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the second part refers to the kind of contribution. Maybe businesses contribute significantly, so "significantly" is the correct term.

Looking back, the options:

C: Significant contribution.

D: No contribution.

So the first part is "Huge power" (C and D), second part is "Significant contribution" (C and F, H, I, J), third part "Corporate social responsibility" (C and D).

So the correct answer must have all three correct. So which option has all three correct.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Huge power, Small contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No, second part is small.

Option D: Huge power, No contribution, Corporate social responsibility. No, second part is no.

So none of the options have all three correct. But the question gives only five options, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, assuming that the second part is incorrect. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the second part is correct and the first is not, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the second part is "Major contribution" which is in options F, H, I, J. So if I have to choose, maybe the correct answer is C, but I'm confused because the second part is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think about the correct answer again.

The question is about what businesses have, what they provide, and what they are responsible for.

I think the correct answer is C: Huge power, Huge power? Wait, no, the options list each option's first part.

Wait, the correct answer is C. Let me think. The first part is Huge power. The second part is Significant contribution. The third part is Corporate social responsibility.

So the options that match are C and D.

But let's check if any of them have all three correct.

Looking again, option C's second part is "Small contribution." So no. Option D's second part is "No contribution." No.

Wait, am I sure about the second part? Maybe I'm wrong.

Another thought: Maybe the second part is about what they can contribute, which could be significant. So the correct answer is C because it has "Huge power," "Significant contribution," and "Corporate social responsibility."

So I think the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question asks about businesses' characteristics within society, their potential contributions, and their obligations. The correct answer must align with the following reasoning:

1. **First Blank (Power):** Businesses have **huge power** as they are large entities in society. This eliminates options A, B, E, G, J.

2. **Second Blank (Contribution):** Businesses can **provide a significant contribution** to society. This narrows the options to C and D.

3. **Third Blank (Harm):** Businesses are **responsible for corporate social responsibility**, addressing environmental and community issues. This confirms that the correct option must have "Corporate social responsibility" as the third part.

Among the remaining options (C and D), the correct choice is C because it aligns with all three criteria: huge power, significant contribution, and corporate social responsibility.
