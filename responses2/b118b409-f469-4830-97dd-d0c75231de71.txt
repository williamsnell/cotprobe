Okay, so I have this problem here about the Alexander's monthly telephone bill. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that last year, the average was $17.05, which was 10% more than the previous year's monthly charge. I need to find out what the monthly charge was the previous year. Hmm, okay.

Alright, let's break it down. Let me denote the previous year's charge as X. So, if X is the previous year's bill, then this year's bill is 10% higher than that. So, this year's bill is X plus 10% of X, which is 1.1 times X. 

Wait, yeah, 10% more would mean multiplying by 1.1. So, last year's bill is X, this year it's 1.1X. And they told me last year's bill was $17.05. So, 1.1X equals 17.05.

Wait, so to find X, I need to divide both sides by 1.1. So, X = 17.05 / 1.1. Let me calculate that. 17.05 divided by 1.1. Let me do the division. 

Hmm, 1.1 times 15 is 16.5, right? Because 1.1 *15 = 16.5. Subtract that from 17.05. 17.05 -16.5=0.55. So, that's 15.05. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1.1 times 15.5 is 17.05. Because 15.5 *1.1 is 15.5 +1.55=17.05. Oh, so X is 15.5. So, the previous year's charge was $15.50.

Looking at the options, option I is $15.50. So, the answer should be I.
