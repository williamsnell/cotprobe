Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about classical economics and the mechanisms an economy in a recession can return to full employment. Hmm, let me think this through. I remember from my studies that the classical view is all about full employment in the long run, meaning the economy tends towards this without any excess capacity. So the question is about what policy can bring it back.

The options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A: Reducing interest rates. I think that when interest rates drop, borrowing becomes cheaper, which can stimulate investment. That might help the economy recover. But wait, how does that bring it back to full employment? I'm not sure if that's the main tool.

Option B: Contractionary monetary policy. Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Contractionary policies are usually things like increasing interest rates or reducing government spending. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing terms. Contractionary refers to policies that reduce aggregate demand. So if the central bank uses contractionary measures, they lower interest rates or reduce money creation. That would make the economy tighter, potentially causing the unemployment rate to rise. So would that help the economy return to full employment?

Option C: Cutting taxes. That sounds like a contractionary policy too. Lower taxes would increase disposable income, which can boost consumer spending and investment. That could stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. I've heard that tax cuts can help in the short term, but I'm trying to remember if they help with full employment. I think in the classical model, the economy would adjust through other policies, not just taxes.

Option D: Expansionary monetary policy. That makes sense. Expansionary policies are used to stimulate the economy, like increasing the money supply (say, by printing more money) or lowering interest rates. Lowering interest rates would make borrowing cheaper, which would encourage investment and consumption. This can lead to increased production, full employment, and lower unemployment. So this would bring the economy back to full employment.

Option E: Decreasing government spending. That's another contractionary policy. If the government doesn't spend as much, that reduces total demand. Like, less government initiatives. That would cause the economy to have lower demand, more unemployment. So not helpful for full employment.

Option F: Reducing imports. That's an import policy. Import reductions would make goods and services cheaper for domestic consumers, leading to increased demand. That would help stimulate the economy and lower unemployment. But again, I'm trying to remember if this is a primary way the economy recovers in the long run.

Option G: Increasing exports. That's expansionary. More exports mean more demand, which can boost the economy. This would lead to higher production, full employment, lower unemployment. So that's a contender.

Option H: Increased government spending. That's expansionary. More government spending boosts demand, which can drive economic growth, but I don't think this is the primary mechanism for full employment recovery in the classical model. The classical model emphasizes that full employment is naturally achieved with flexible prices and wages, so other policies are the main tools.

Option I: Falling wages and prices. Well, if wages and prices fall, that would reduce overall demand. It would make goods and services cheaper, but perhaps less purchasing power. This would likely cause a contractionary effect, making the economy tighter. So that's not helping.

Option J: Rising wages and prices. That's expansionary in the sense that it's increasing demand. Higher wages might lead to increased production, and higher prices could drive demand. So this would stimulate the economy, helping to reach full employment.

So, the question is about what can help the economy return to full employment during a recession. Expansionary policies (like increasing government spending, cutting taxes, or lowering interest rates) would help. Contractionary policies (like reducing government spending or interest rates) would make the economy more紧缩, which is bad for full employment.

Looking back at the options, let's see which ones are expansionary. D, G, J are all expansionary.

Wait, but the question is about what can help. So, any of these would work. But the question is likely looking for a specific one.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the correct answer is supposed to be one of them. I think the question is asking which policy is a way the economy can recover.

In classical analysis, the key is that full employment is determined by flexible prices and wages, so the main tools are expansionary ones. So, the options would be D, G, or J.

Wait, but the question gives each option, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me think about the options again.

The question says: “According to Classical analysis an economy in a recession can return to full employment through” So the correct answer would be one of the expansionary ones: D, G, or J.

Wait, the options are:

D: expansionary monetary policy.

G: increasing exports.

J: rising wages and prices.

I think in the context of the classical model, the answer is expansionary policies. So either D, G, or J.

Wait, but all these options are expansionary.

Wait, but let's think. The correct answer is probably option D: expansionary monetary policy. Because in the classical model, the economy is at full employment when prices and wages are flexible and don't change much. So expansionary policies (like increasing government spending, lowering interest rates, increasing exports) will stimulate the economy until it reaches full employment.

Alternatively, contractionary policies (like reducing taxes, cutting government spending, lowering interest rates) would make the economy more紧缩, making the economy unable to return to full employment.

So the answer must be an expansionary policy. So looking at the options, which are D, G, J.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D: expansionary monetary policy.

Option G: increasing exports.

Option J: rising wages and prices.

In the context of the classical model, the best way is to use expansionary policies, which would be D, G, or J.

But the options are separate; the question gives each as a possible choice.

Wait, but the question is about what the economy can do. So the answer is expansionary policy, which is either D, G, or J.

But the options are presented as single choices. Let me think about the question again. The question is asking which of the options is a correct way.

Wait, but in the options, J is rising wages and prices, which would be an expansionary push towards full employment. So the correct answer would be option D, G, or J.

Wait, but the options are given as A to J, each as a possible correct answer. So the correct answer is one of these.

Wait, but looking back, in the options, the choice is to select one. So which is the right one?

Wait, the question is about the options. The options are all possible answers, and the correct one is the expansionary policy.

So the correct options are D, G, or J.

Wait, but the options are presented as separate letters, so I have to choose the letter corresponding to each.

Looking at the options again:

A: reducing interest rates.

B: contractionary.

C: tax cut.

D: expansionary.

E: decrease government spending.

F: reduce imports.

G: increase exports.

H: increase G.

I: falling wages.

J: rising wages.

So the correct answers would include D, G, J.

Wait, but the question is looking for the correct option. So the correct answer is expansionary policy, which is either D, G, or J.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, so the correct answer is D, G, or J.

But according to my previous knowledge, the main policy in the classical model is expansionary. So all options D, G, J are correct.

Wait, but in the options, J is rising wages and prices. That would increase demand, leading to full employment.

So, looking for the correct classical approach, the answer is expansionary policy.

So the correct answer is D, G, or J. But which one is it?

Wait, the question is phrased as: According to Classical analysis an economy in a recession can return to full employment through which of the following.

The correct answer is D, G, or J. But the options are single letters. So in the options, each is a possible answer, and the correct one would be any of these three.

Wait, but in the options, J is rising wages and prices, which would be a contractionary push? No, because if prices and wages rise, it's an expansionary push for full employment.

Wait, in the classical model, prices and wages are flexible, so any policy that increases demand will lead to full employment.

So, the correct answer is any expansionary policy, like D, G, or J.

Looking back, the options are presented as A to J, each a single letter. So the correct answer is one of these.

But the question says "through" which of the following. So any of these can be correct.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is expansionary monetary policy, which is option D.

Wait, but looking for the correct classical approach, the main tool is expansionary.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that in the short run, contractionary policies can help with full employment, but in the long run, classical says that full employment is naturally achieved.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently.

The question is about the economy in a recession. So the problem is a recession, implying that the economy is struggling and is below full employment. To get back to full employment, the economy needs to have increased demand.

Expansionary policies (like increasing G, expanding the money supply, or lowering interest rates) would boost demand, leading to full employment.

Contractionary policies (like reducing G, lowering interest rates, cutting taxes) would decrease demand, leading to a contraction.

So the correct answer is an expansionary policy, so D, G, or J.

In the options, the correct answers are D, G, or J.

Wait, but the options are single letters, so I have to pick one. I think the correct answer in the classical model is the expansionary policy, which would be D, G, or J.

Wait, but looking for the correct answer, I think the correct answer is D: expansionary monetary policy.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, another thought: in the classical model, contractionary policies are not helpful because they reduce the demand for goods and services. So, the correct answer is expansionary, which would be D, G, or J.

But the question is looking for which of the options is a correct way. So, all three options are correct. But the question gives each as a possible choice, so perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall: according to classical analysis, in the long run, full employment is achieved. So the economy will return to full employment via expansionary policies. So the correct answer is D, G, or J.

But in the question, the options are each a single letter, so the correct answer is any of these. But looking at the options, the correct answer is D: expansionary monetary policy. G is increasing exports, which would also stimulate the economy. J is rising wages and prices, which also stimulate the economy.

Wait, but in the context of the options, the correct answers would be any of these, but the question is presented as a single-choice question, so perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the options given.

Wait, the options are presented as separate letters. So the correct answer is any of D, G, or J.

But the question is, which option is correct. So I might have to pick any. But in the options, the correct answer is D, G, or J.

But since the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer, I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: expansionary monetary policy.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is J: rising wages and prices.

Wait, but J would be a contractionary push. Because rising wages and prices would increase demand, pushing the economy towards full employment. So J is expansionary.

Wait, so J is expansionary, so the correct answer is D, G, or J.

But according to the options, the correct answer is D: expansionary monetary policy.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think: under classical analysis, an economy in a recession can be restored to full employment via expansionary monetary policy, expansionary fiscal policy, or expansionary structural policy.

The options are given as A to J, so the correct answer is any of D, G, or J.

But the question is asking which of the following is a way. So, each is a possible correct answer, but the options are single letters, so the correct answer is any of these. However, the question probably expects the expansionary policy, which is D.

So, I think the correct answer is D: expansionary monetary policy.

To determine how an economy in a recession can return to full employment according to classical analysis, we need to focus on expansionary policies that stimulate demand and reduce unemployment. Expansionary policies include increasing government spending, lowering interest rates, or increasing exports, as these measures boost aggregate demand, leading the economy toward full employment.

- **Option A: Reducing interest rates**  
  While lowering interest rates can stimulate investment and consumption, it is not a primary mechanism for full employment recovery in the classical model.

- **Option B: Contractionary monetary policy**  
  This involves policies like raising interest rates or reducing government spending, which can reduce demand and lead to a contraction, not full employment.

- **Option C: Cutting taxes**  
  Tax cuts can increase disposable income, boosting consumer spending and investment, but this is more of a contractionary policy and not the primary method for full employment recovery.

- **Option D: Expansionary monetary policy**  
  This involves increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, or decreasing taxes, which directly stimulate demand and are key tools for restoring full employment.

- **Option E: Decreasing government spending**  
  This reduces total demand, leading to a contractionary effect and not full employment.

- **Option F: Reducing imports**  
  Lowering imports can increase demand, but this is a contractionary push and not the main mechanism.

- **Option G: Increasing exports**  
  Higher exports boost demand, which is expansionary and can restore full employment.

- **Option H: Increased government spending**  
  This is part of expansionary policy and can stimulate the economy.

- **Option I: Falling wages and prices**  
  Lowering wages and prices reduce demand, leading to a contractionary push.

- **Option J: Rising wages and prices**  
  This increases demand, which is expansionary and can restore full employment.

In the classical model, full employment is achieved through expansionary policies. Among the options, **D: expansionary monetary policy** and **G: increasing exports** and **J: rising wages and prices** are all expansionary and can restore full employment. However, the question asks for one correct answer, and the most direct expansionary policy is **D: expansionary monetary policy**.

ANSWER: D
