Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the horsepower of a jet aircraft's engine. Hmm, let's see what I remember about how to approach this. 

The question says the engine develops a thrust of 3000 lb, and it's moving at a velocity of 600 mi/hr, which is converted to 800 ft/sec. I need to find the horsepower. I'm a bit rusty, but I think horsepower is related to power, which is work done over time. Oh right, power in horsepower is calculated using the formula:

Power (in horsepower) = Thrust (in pounds) × Velocity (in ft/sec) / 745.7

Wait, or is it divided by 550? Wait, no, let me think. I think the formula is Power (in horsepower) = (Thrust × Velocity) / 745.7. Because I remember that the unit conversion for horsepower is based on foot pounds per second. So, 1 horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second, and the formula for power is Work (ft·lbf/s) = (Force in lb × Velocity in ft/s) / 745.7. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, that formula is actually Power (hp) = Thrust (lbf) × Velocity (ft/s) / 550. Or is it 745.7? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused between these numbers.

Wait, I think the correct formula is Power (hp) = (Thrust (lbf) × Velocity (ft/s)) / 550. Let me confirm. I recall that 1 horsepower is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second. Power in horsepower is given by (force in pounds × velocity in feet per second) divided by 550. So, the formula is hp = (Thrust × Velocity) / 550.

Let me plug in the numbers. Thrust is 3000 lb, velocity is 800 ft/s. So, 3000 * 800 = 2,400,000 (lb·ft/s). Then divide by 550. 2,400,000 / 550 ≈ let's calculate this.

Divide 2,400,000 by 550. Let me do this step by step. 550 goes into 2,400,000 how many times? Hmm, 550 * 4000 = 2,200,000. Subtract that from 2,400,000: 200,000 left. 550 goes into 200,000 about 363.636 times. So total would be 4000 + 363.636 ≈ 4363.636. So approximately 4363.64 horsepower. Looking at the options, option G is 4700, which is higher. Option H is 4800, which is a bit higher. Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 3000 * 800 is 2,400,000. Divided by 550. Let me compute 2,400,000 ÷ 550.

Let me compute 2,400,000 ÷ 550. Let's see: 550 * 4000 = 2,200,000. So 2,400,000 - 2,200,000 = 200,000. Now 550 * 363 = 550*(300+63) = 165000 + 34650 = 199,650. So 363 is 550*363=199650. Hmm, that's 199,650. So 200,000 is 199,650 + 350. So 363.636. So total is 4000 + 363.636 ≈ 4363.636 hp.

Wait, but the options are A:6000, B:5200, etc., and option G is 4700, H is 4800. Hmm, none of the options is 4363. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong denominator. Let me think again: I've heard that 1 horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second. So yes, the formula is (Thrust * Velocity) / 550. So that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question expects the calculation to use 550 as the denominator, so I think that's correct. So, if it's 3000 * 800 = 2,400,000. 2,400,000 /550 ≈ 4363.636. So approximately 4364 hp. The closest option is G:4700 and H:4800. So neither is exact. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the division again. 2,400,000 divided by 550.

Alternative approach: 550 × 4363 = ?

Wait, 550 × 4000 = 2,200,000.

550 × 363 = 550*(300 + 60 +3) = 165000 + 33000 + 1650 = 165000+33000=198000+1650=199,650.

So 2,200,000 + 199,650 = 2,399,650. That's just a bit less than 2,400,000. So 550 × 4363 = 2,399,650.

So the remainder is 2,400,000 - 2,399,650 = 350.

So 350 /550 = 0.63636... So total is 4363.636, which is approx 4363.64, as calculated before.

So the closest option is G:4700 and H:4800. But 4364 is between 4300 and 4400. None of the options exactly match this. Hmm, wait the options given are:

A:6000, B:5200, C:4700, D:4500, E:5000, F:5100, G:4300, H:4800, I:4000, J:5500.

Wait, so the closest would be G:4300, but that's 4300, but our calculation is about 4363.64, which is 63.64 over 4300. So that's a difference of 63.6 hp. Option G is 4300, which is 63.6 below. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh wait! Another way to think about it: 1 horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second. So the power in ft-lbf/s is (Thrust in lbf) * (velocity in ft/s). Then, to get horsepower, divide by 550.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's divided by 550 or multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 550 as the denominator, so the calculation is (Thrust * Velocity) / 550. Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as (3000 lb)*(800 ft/s) = 2,400,000 lb·ft/s. Convert that to horsepower: 2,400,000 / 550 = 4363.636 hp.

Hmm, but the options don't include this. So perhaps the question intended to use a different unit conversion. Oh! Wait, I think I might have forgotten whether the formula uses 550 or 745.7. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: 1 horsepower is 550 ft-lbf per second. So, power (in ft-lbf/s) = thrust (lb) * velocity (ft/s) = 3000 * 800 = 2,400,000. Then, to get horsepower, divide by 550. So 2,400,000 / 550 = 4363.64 hp. 

But the question's options don't have this number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do the division again.

2,400,000 ÷ 550. Let's compute 2,400,000 ÷ 550.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 240,000 ÷ 55.

Compute 240,000 /55.

55 × 4363 = 2,400,000 - Wait, 55 × 4363 is 55 × (4000 + 363) = 55×4000=220,000; 55×363=20,000+...

Wait, 55 × 363: 55 × 300 = 16,500; 55 × 63=3,465. So 16,500 +3,465=19,965.

So 55 ×4000=220,000 and 55 ×363=19,965. So 220,000 +19,965=239,965.

So 240,000 - 239,965=35.

So 55 × 6363 = 239,965. Hmm, no, wait, 55 ×4363 = 239,965, as 4363 is 4000+363, as above.

So 240,000 is 239,965 +35, so 240,000=55×4363 +35.

So 240,000 ÷55 =4363 + (35/55)=4363 + 7/11 ≈4363.636.

So yes, 4363.64 hp.

But looking at the options, the closest is G:4300 and H:4800. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is (Thrust × Velocity) / 745.7, not 550. Let me try that.

2,400,000 /745.7 ≈ ?

Let me compute 745.7 ×3280=?

Wait, 745.7 ×3280. Hmm, 700 ×3000=2,100,000, but I need to compute 745.7 ×3280.

Wait, 3280 = 3000 + 280.

745.7 ×3000 = 2,237,100.

745.7 ×280 = let's compute 745.7 × 200=149,140; 745.7×80=59,656. So 149,140 +59,656=208,796.

Adding to 2,237,100: 2,237,100 +208,796=2,445,896.

Wait, but our numerator is 2,400,000. So 745.7 × 3280=2,445,896. Which is higher than 2,400,000.

So 3280 ×745.7=2,445,896.

So 2,400,000 would be 3280 minus how much?

Let me find how much we need to subtract from 3280 to get to 2,400,000.

The difference is 2,445,896 - 2,400,000 =45,896.

So 745.7 × x =45,896.

x=45,896 /745.7 ≈61.76.

So total is 3280 -61.76=3218.24.

So 745.7 ×3218.24=2,400,000.

So 2,400,000 /745.7≈3218.24 hp.

Which is approximately 3218 hp. But that's not even an option. So that can't be right.

Wait, so perhaps I should stick with the 550 as denominator. So going back, 4363.64 hp, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something in the unit conversion.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula uses a different unit. Oh, wait! Wait, the formula for horsepower when using lbf and ft/s is:

"P = (F × v) / 745.7"

So P in horsepower is (F in lb × v in ft/s) / 745.7.

So that's the same as I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the division. Let me compute 2,400,000 ÷ 550 again.

2,400,000 ÷ 550.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 240,000 /55.

Compute 55 × 4363 = 240, 000? Let me compute 4363 ×55.

4363 ×50=218,150.

4363 ×5=21,815.

Total: 218,150 +21,815 =240, 000+something? Wait, 218,150 +21,815 is 240,000- exactly? Wait, 218,150 +21,815=240,000- because 218,150 +21,815=240,000- no, 218,150 +21,815 = 240,000 minus 0, since 218,150 +21,815 is 240,000? Wait, 218,150 +21,815 is 240, 000- no, because 200,000 +20,000=220,000, 18,150 +1,815=20,000. So total is 240,000. So 4363 ×55=240,000, which is correct. So 2,400,000 ÷550=4363.64 hp.

So the answer should be approximately 4364 hp. But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the closest is option G: 4300 and H:4800. Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the problem statement? Let me check: the engine's thrust is 3000 lb. Velocity is 600 mi/hr, which is converted to 800 ft/s. So I think that's correct.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Another approach: hp = (F * V) / (33,000). Wait, no, that's another formula. Wait, no, because 1 HP = 550 ft-lbf/s. So (F * V) /550 = hp.

Alternatively, another formula I found online: hp = (F * V) / (745.7). So the same as I used. So 3000 * 800 =2,400,000. Divided by 550 is 4363.64. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 3000 * 800. Let me compute that: 3000 *800 = 2,400,000. Correct. So the only option is G:4300, H:4800.

Wait, but perhaps the question's options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another way: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s. So power in ft-lbf/s is (3000 lb * 800 ft/s) = 2,400,000 lb-ft/s. So hp is 2,400,000 /550 =4363.64 hp.

But looking at the options, the closest would be G:4300 or H:4800.

Wait, but none of the options are 4364. So perhaps I did a miscalculation. Let me compute 2,400,000 ÷550 again.

Let me divide 2,400,000 by 550.

550 × 4000 = 2,200,000.

Subtract that from 2,400,000: 200,000 remains.

550 ×363 = 199,650.

Subtract that from 200,000: 40 left.

So 550 × 363=199,650, and 40 is 550×0.0727.

So total hp=4000 +363.636=4363.636.

So the correct answer is approximately 4364 hp.

Looking back at the options, none match this. So perhaps the question is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question uses 745.7 as the denominator. So let's compute 2,400,000 ÷745.7.

745.7 ×3218 =?

Let me compute 745.7 ×3000=2,237,100.

745.7 ×200=149,140.

745.7 ×18= let's compute 700×18=12,600; 45.7×18=822.6. Sum is 12,600+822.6=13,422.6.

So 745.7 ×3218 =2,237,100 +149,140=2,386,240 +13,422.6=2,399,662.6.

So 745.7 ×3218=2,399,662.6.

Subtract that from 2,400,000: 2,400,000 -2,399,662.6=337.4.

So 337.4 left. So 337.4 ÷745.7≈0.4537.

So total hp≈3218 +0.4537=3218.45 hp.

But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula (F * V) / 550 as I did before. So 3000 *800=2,400,000. 2,400,000 /550=4363.64. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used 3000 * (800 ft/s) and converted to hp via another factor. Wait, perhaps I should have used 3000 lb * 800 ft/s = 2,400,000 lb-ft/s. Then, since 1 hp is 550 lb-ft/s, so 2,400,000 /550 =4363.64 hp.

So that's correct. So the answer is approximately 4364 hp.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option G:4300, but that's 63.64 hp less. Hmm, perhaps the question intended to use a different unit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (F * V) / (33,000), which is another way to compute horsepower. Wait, 33,000 is 550 ×60. Because 550 ×60=33,000.

Wait, let's compute 2,400,000 /33,000.

33,000 ×72=2,376,000.

Subtracting from 2,400,000: 2,400,000 -2,376,000=24,000.

33,000 ×0.727=24,000.

So 72.727 → 72.727 hp.

So 2,400,000 /33,000=72.727 hp.

But that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (F * V) / (745.7). Let's compute that.

2,400,000 /745.7≈3218 hp.

But again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division of 2,400,000 by 550. Let me do it again.

550 ×4363=2,399,650.

2,400,000 -2,399,650=350.

So 350 /550=0.636.

So 4363.636 hp.

Wait, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that seems unlikely. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another way: 1 horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second. So to find horsepower, (force in lb × velocity in ft/s) / 550.

So the correct formula is (F * V) / 550.

So with F=3000 lb, V=800 ft/s, 3000 *800 =2,400,000.

Divide by 550: 2,400,000 /550=4363.64 hp.

So that's correct.

But the options are:

A:6000, B:5200, C:4700, D:4500, E:5000, F:5100, G:4300, H:4800, I:4000, J:5500.

So the closest is G:4300 or H:4800. But my calculation is 4364, which is between G and H.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H:4800, but that's 4800 hp, which is higher than our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should convert the velocity from mi/hr to ft/s at the beginning. Let me do that.

Given velocity is 600 mi/hr.

Convert to ft/s: 600 *5280 ft /3600 s.

Compute 600 *5280 =3,168,000 ft.

Divide by 3600: 3,168,000 /3600 =880 ft/s.

Wait a minute, earlier I thought it was 800 ft/s, but this calculation gives 880 ft/s.

Wait, let me check the conversion factor: 1 mi = 5280 ft, 1 hour = 3600 s.

So 600 mi/hr = 600 *5280 ft /3600 s.

Compute 600 *5280 =3,168,000 ft.

Divide by 3600: 3,168,000 ÷3600=880 ft/s.

Ah, so I made a mistake earlier: I thought the velocity was 800 ft/s, but it's actually 880 ft/s. That would change the calculation.

So let me recalculate.

So thrust is 3000 lb, velocity is 880 ft/s.

Power in ft-lbf/s is 3000 *880=2,640,000.

Divide by 550: 2,640,000 /550=4800 hp.

Ah, so that's the correct answer. Because, earlier, I thought the velocity was 800 ft/s, but it's actually 880 ft/s. So that changes the calculation.

So let me check the steps again.

1. Convert 600 mi/hr to ft/s: 600 *5280 ft /3600 s = (600 *5280)/3600 = (600/3600)*5280= (1/6)*5280= 880 ft/s.

2. So velocity is 880 ft/s.

3. Thrust is 3000 lb.

4. Power in ft-lbf/s: (F * V) = 3000 *880=2,640,000.

5. Convert to horsepower: 2,640,000 /550=4800 hp.

So the correct answer is H:4800 hp.

But wait, earlier, I thought the velocity was 800 ft/s, which would give 3000 *800=2,400,000, divided by 550=4363.64, which is G:4300. But that's incorrect because the actual velocity is 880 ft/s, not 800 ft/s.

So that was a mistake; I need to correct that.

So let me recap:

- The engine's thrust is 3000 lb.

- The velocity is 600 mi/hr.

- Velocity in ft/s is (600 *5280)/3600 =880 ft/s.

- So power in ft-lbf/s is 3000 *880=2,640,000.

- Convert to horsepower: 2,640,000 /550=4800 hp.

So the correct answer is H:4800 hp.

But wait, earlier I thought the velocity was 800 ft/s, leading to 3000 *800=2,400,000, divided by 550=4363.64 hp, which is G:4300. But that's wrong because the correct velocity is 880 ft/s.

So I think I made a mistake earlier by using 800 ft/s instead of 880 ft/s. So the correct answer is 4800 hp, which is option H.

But looking back at the options, I see that option H is 4800. So the correct answer is H:4800 hp.

Wait, but earlier I thought the velocity was 800 ft/s, leading to 3000 *800=2,400,000, which is 4363.64 hp, but that's incorrect. So the correct calculation is 880 ft/s, leading to 4800 hp.

So the correct answer is H:4800 hp.

But wait, looking back at the options, I see that option G is 4300, which is close. But in reality, it's 4800, which is H.

So that's the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is **H: 4800 hp**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Convert the velocity from mi/hr to ft/s:**
   - Given velocity is 600 mi/hr.
   - Conversion factor: 1 mi = 5280 ft, 1 hour = 3600 s.
   - Velocity in ft/s: (600 * 5280) / 3600 = 880 ft/s.

2. **Calculate the power in ft-lbf/s:**
   - Thrust (F) = 3000 lb.
   - Velocity (V) = 880 ft/s.
   - Power (P) = F * V = 3000 * 880 = 2,640,000 ft-lbf/s.

3. **Convert power to horsepower:**
   - 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf/s.
   - Horsepower (HP) = Power (P) / 550 = 2,640,000 / 550 = 4800 hp.

**Final Answer:** H: 4800 hp
