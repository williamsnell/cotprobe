Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the percentage difference between the natural logarithm of (1+x) and x when x is 0.0050. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

First, I remember that the natural logarithm function, ln(1+x), can be expanded using a Taylor series. Oh right, the expansion for ln(1+x) around x=0 is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 and so on. So for small x, ln(1+x) is approximately x minus a bit.

The question is asking for the percentage difference between ln(1+x) and x. Wait, percentage difference is a bit tricky. Oh wait, maybe it's just the difference between the two values expressed as a percentage of one of them, like (ln(1+x) - x) divided by x, multiplied by 100, to get the percentage difference.

So let me compute ln(1.005) first. Since x is 0.005, 1+x is 1.005. Using the Taylor series, I can approximate ln(1.005) as x - x²/2. Let's compute that. x is 0.005, so x squared is 0.000025. Divided by 2, that's 0.0000125. So ln(1.005) ≈ 0.005 - 0.0000125 = 0.0049875.

Now, the difference between ln(1+x) and x is 0.0049875 - 0.005 = -0.0000125. The percentage difference is the absolute value of this difference divided by x, times 100. So:

Percentage difference = (|0.0049875 - 0.005|) / 0.005 * 100 = (0.0000125) / 0.005 * 100.

Calculating that: 0.0000125 divided by 0.005 is 0.0025. Multiply by 100 gives 0.25%. But wait, looking at the options, option H is 0.100%, and I is 0.025%, and J is 0.249%. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe I should check more accurately.

Wait a second, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely. Let me compute ln(1.005) accurately. Alternatively, maybe using a calculator would be better. Wait, but I don't have a calculator here. Oh well, maybe I should just compute it.

Alternatively, I remember that for small x, ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3. So let's compute that for x=0.005.

x =0.005, x²=0.000025, x³=0.000000125.

So ln(1.005) ≈ 0.005 - 0.000025/2 + 0.000000125/3.

Calculating each term: 0.005 is 0.005. 0.000025/2 is 0.0000125. So subtract that: 0.005 - 0.0000125 = 0.0049875. Now, the next term is 0.000000125 /3 ≈ 0.0000000416667. So adding that: 0.0049875 + 0.0000000416667 ≈ 0.0049875416667.

So ln(1.005) ≈ 0.0049875416667.

The exact value of ln(1.005) is approximately 0.004987561686. So the difference is 0.004987561686 - 0.005 = -0.0000124383132.

So the absolute value is 0.0000124383132.

Now, to find the percentage difference, divide that by x (0.005) and multiply by 100.

So 0.0000124383132 / 0.005 = 0.00248766264. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 0.248766264%, which is approximately 0.249%.

Looking at the options, J is 0.249%. So that's the answer.

To calculate the percentage difference between ln(1+x) and x for x = 0.0050, we start by approximating ln(1.005) using the Taylor series expansion:

\[
\ln(1+x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \dots
\]

For x = 0.005, the approximation becomes:

\[
\ln(1.005) \approx 0.005 - \frac{(0.005)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.005)^3}{3}
\]

Calculating each term:
- \( 0.005^2 = 0.000025 \), so \( \frac{0.000025}{2} = 0.0000125 \).
- \( 0.005^3 = 0.000000125 \), so \( \frac{0.000000125}{3} \approx 0.0000000416667 \).

Adding these:
\[
\ln(1.005) \approx 0.005 - 0.0000125 + 0.0000000416667 \approx 0.0049875416667
\]

The difference between ln(1+x) and x is:
\[
\ln(1.005) - 0.005 = 0.0049875416667 - 0.005 = -0.0000124383132
\]

The absolute value of this difference is:
\[
0.0000124383132
\]

To find the percentage difference:
\[
\text{Percentage difference} = \left( \frac{0.0000124383132}{0.005} \right) \times 100 \approx 0.248766264\%
\]

The closest option to this value is **0.249%**. 

Answer: J: 0.249%
