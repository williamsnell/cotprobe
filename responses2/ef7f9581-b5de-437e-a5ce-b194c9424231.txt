Okay, so I have to figure out which one of the options isn't a mineral. Let me start by recalling what minerals are. Minerals are inorganic substances with a crystal structure, so they're naturally occurring. They're classified into seven main groups: carbonates, phosphates, hydroxides, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, halides, and nitrates.

Looking at the options, I need to go through each one and see if they fit into these categories.

Option A: Calcite. I think calcite is a mineral, specifically a form of calcium carbonate. So A is a mineral.

Option B: Quartz. Quartz is another mineral, more commonly known as SiO2. Definitely a mineral.

Option C: Topaz. Topaz is also known as topazite, which is a form of rutile. rutile is TiO2, so Topaz is a mineral.

Option D: Diamond. Diamond is a mineral, specifically the element carbon in its pure form. So D is a mineral.

Option E: Gypsum. Gypsum is calcium sulfate, which is a mineral. So E is a mineral.

Option F: Graphite. Graphite is a form of carbon in its solid state, which is a mineral. So F is a mineral.

Option G: Feldspar. Feldspar is a type of quartz. It's a mineral, so G is a mineral.

Option H: Lithium. Lithium is an element, not a mineral. It's a metal, not an inorganic substance. So H isn't a mineral.

Option I: Mica. Mica is a mineral, specifically a form of silicon dioxide. So I is a mineral.

Option J: Not in the list, but looking back, the options are A to I, so the options are A to I as given.

So the only one that isn't a mineral is H: Lithium. Because lithium isn't an inorganic mineral; it's a metal.

The correct answer is H: Lithium, as it is not a mineral.

Answer: H
