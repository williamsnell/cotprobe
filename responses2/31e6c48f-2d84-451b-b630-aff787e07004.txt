Okay, so I need to find the sum of the infinite series where each term is (cos(1/n²) - cos(1/(n+1)^2)). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with series that have terms like this, especially with cosines, it might be a telescoping series. Telescoping series are those where a lot of terms cancel out when you write out the partial sums.

So, the series is from n=1 to infinity of [cos(1/n²) - cos(1/(n+1)^2)]. Let me write out the first few terms to see the pattern. 

For n=1: cos(1) - cos(1/4)
n=2: cos(1/4) - cos(1/9)
n=3: cos(1/9) - cos(1/16)
and so on.

I notice that each negative term cancels with the next positive term. So, when I add up the first few terms:

cos(1) - cos(1/4) + cos(1/4) - cos(1/9) + cos(1/9) - cos(1/16) + ... 

All the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving just cos(1) - lim_{n→∞} cos(1/(n+1)^2). 

Wait, because as n approaches infinity, 1/(n+1)^2 approaches 0. What's cos(0)? That's 1. So, the last term becomes cos(1) - 1.

Wait, but wait. The first term is cos(1) (n=1) and the last term is cos(0) which is 1. So the sum S = cos(1) - cos(0) = cos(1) - 1. 

Let me compute cos(1) numerically. I remember that cos(1 radian) is approximately 0.5403. So cos(1) - 1 is 0.5403 - 1 = -0.4597. Looking at the options, option G is 1.000, and option J is -0.459. Hmm, so that's close to option J.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I did the telescoping correctly. The series is sum_{n=1}^infty [cos(1/n²) - cos(1/(n+1)^2)].

So each term is (cos(a_n) - cos(b_n)), where a_n = 1/n² and b_n = 1/(n+1)^2. When we add these, the sum becomes (cos(1) - cos(1/4)) + (cos(1/4) - cos(1/9)) + (cos(1/9) - cos(1/16)) + ... and so on. So each time, the negative term cancels the positive term of the next term. So the partial sum up to N would be cos(1) - cos(1/(N+1)^2).

As N approaches infinity, 1/(N+1)^2 approaches zero. Cos(0) is 1. So the limit is cos(1) - 1. Which is approximately 0.5403 - 1 = -0.4597. So the sum converges to about -0.4597.

Looking at the options, option J is -0.459. So the correct answer should be J.

The given series is a telescoping series where each term cancels out with the next term. The partial sum up to N is cos(1) - cos(1/(N+1)^2). As N approaches infinity, cos(1/(N+1)^2) approaches cos(0) = 1, so the sum converges to cos(1) - 1 ≈ -0.4597. Among the options, the closest match is J: -0.459.

Answer: J
