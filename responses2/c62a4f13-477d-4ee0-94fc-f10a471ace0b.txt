Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the beta minus decay of He^6. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, let me start by recalling what I know about beta decay.

Beta minus decay, right? That's when a neutron in an atomic nucleus converts into a proton, emitting an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino. The nucleus becomes positively charged because it gains a proton. So, in He^6, which is helium-6, the parent nucleus is He which has an atomic number of 2. 

Wait, the decay equation would be something like He^6 → _something + β^- + ν̄. Oh, right, the daughter nucleus must be an isotope with atomic number one more than the parent because it's a beta plus decay? Wait no, beta minus increases the atomic number. So He-6 (Z=2) decays to an isotope with Z=3, which is lithium-6, right? Because He-6 decays to Li-6 when it emits a beta particle.

So, the decay equation is: He^6 → Li^6 + β^- + ν̄. Or wait, wait, I think the general form is: for a beta minus decay, the parent has Z, and the daughter has Z+1. So He^6 (Z=2) decays to Li^6 (Z=3), because 2+1=3. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the maximum kinetic energy of the beta minus emitted. So, I need to find the maximum kinetic energy achievable. I remember that in beta decay, the maximum kinetic energy depends on the rest mass energies of the parent and daughter nuclei. 

The maximum kinetic energy occurs when the beta particle and the daughter are emitted with the least kinetic energy? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, in beta decay, the maximum kinetic energy is achieved when the daughter nucleus is at rest, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think that the maximum energy is when the daughter nucleus is at rest, making the beta particle's energy as high as possible because it's the only one moving.

Wait, no, that's not right. The maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle occurs when the daughter nucleus is at rest. Because if the daughter nucleus has some kinetic energy, the beta particle's energy is reduced. So, when the daughter nucleus is at rest, the beta particle's kinetic energy is maximized.

So, the maximum kinetic energy (K_max) of the beta particle is given by the energy released in the decay minus the rest mass energies of the daughter and the beta particle (which is negligible, since it's a light particle). Hmm, but wait, the beta particle is a high-energy particle, so maybe I should consider that. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum kinetic energy is the total energy available in the decay (the mass difference) minus the rest energies of the daughter nucleus and the beta particle.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the rest mass difference between the parent and the daughter plus the beta particle. Since the beta particle's mass is negligible, its kinetic energy can be approximated as the total energy available in the decay.

The formula I remember is that the maximum kinetic energy (K_max) of the beta particle is equal to the total mass difference (mass of parent minus mass of daughter) converted into energy, i.e., K_max = (E_parent - E_daughter) = (m_parent c² - m_daughter c²). But wait, wait, because E = mc², so the difference is (m_parent - m_daughter) c² = K_max (in eV, then converted to MeV).

So, let's get the masses right. 

He-6 (parent) has a mass of approximately 6.01512 atomic mass units (u). Lithium-6 (Daughter) has a mass of about 6.01477 atomic mass units. So the difference is:

Δm = 6.01512 u - 6.01477 u = 0.00035 u.

But wait, I should make sure I have the right masses. Let me think: He-6 is He with 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Wait, no, He has Z=2, so 2 protons and 4 neutrons. Wait, no, wait: He-6 is ^6He, which has 6 protons? No, no. Wait, no, He is Helium, which has Z=2, so ^6He would have 2 protons and 4 neutrons (since 2 + 4 =6).

Wait, the mass of a proton is 1.007276 u, and a neutron is 1.008665 u. So, He-6 has Z=2 → 2 protons and 4 neutrons. So mass is (2 *1.007276) + (4 *1.008665) = let me calculate that.

2 * 1.007276 = 2.014552 u.

4 * 1.008665 = 4.03466 u.

Total: 2.014552 +4.03466 → 6.049212 u.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because I thought He-6 is 6.01512 u. Oh wait, perhaps I misremembered. Let me check. No, wait, I think I'm confusing isotopes. Let me think: The atomic masses of common isotopes.

Wait, He-4 is 4 u, He-5 is 5.01214 u, He-6 is 6.01512 u. So, yeah, He-6 is 6.01512 u.

Lithium-6, which is Z=3, so has 3 protons and 3 neutrons? Wait, no, wait, wait. Z=3 → 3 protons, and since the mass number is 6, it's 6 = 3 protons + 3 neutrons. So, mass is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) → 6.047823 u.

Wait, but earlier I thought Li-6 has a mass of about 6.01477 u. Hmm, but that doesn't match. Maybe I'm getting the isotope wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the masses of He-6 and Li-6 from a standard table.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the parent as He^6, which is He with 6 protons? Wait, that can't be because He is He-6, which is He with 2 protons. Oh wait, no, wait. He is Helium, which is He-4, He-5, He-6... So, He-6 would have 6 protons, which would be Carbon-6? No, that can't be. Wait, no, Helium has Z=2. So, He-6 would be 6 protons, but that's a mistake. I think I'm getting confused here. Wait, He-6 would have 6 protons and 0 neutrons? That's impossible, because atoms have protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

Wait, no. Wait, the notation is ^A_Z X, where A is the mass number (number of protons + neutrons). So, He-6 is ^6_2 He, which has 2 protons and 4 neutrons. So, mass of He-6 is 2*(1.007276) + 4*(1.008665) = 2.014552 +4.03466 → 6.049212 u.

Wait, but I thought earlier that He-6 is 6.01512 u. Oh wait, that can't be. Wait, another source says that the atomic mass of He-6 is 6.01512 u. So perhaps I mixed up something. So for He-6, the mass is approximately 6.01512 u.

Then, the daughter is Li-6. Wait, Li has atomic number 3, so it's Li-6? Because the mass number is 6. So, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So mass is 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) → 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but that's more than He-6. Which doesn't make sense because Li-6 is a lighter isotope than He-6. Wait, no, wait, He-6 is heavier than Li-6? Or is it the other way around?

No, wait, Li has a higher binding energy than He, so lower mass. So Li-6 should have a lower mass than He-6.

Wait, but according to this, He-6 is 6.01512, and Li-6 is 6.047823. Oh, that's a big difference, but according to my calculation, He-6 is 6.0492 u, which is heavier than Li-6. But that's impossible because Li is lighter.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recalculate:

He-6: Z=2, so 2 protons and 4 neutrons.

Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So 2 protons: 2 * 1.007276 = 2.014552 u.

4 neutrons: 4 *1.008665 = 4.03466 u.

Total: 2.014552 +4.03466 → 6.049212 u.

Yes, that's correct.

Li-6: Z=3, 3 protons, 3 neutrons.

So 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.

3 *1.008665 = 3.025995 u.

Total: 6.051823 u.

Wait, that's 6.051823. But that's higher than He-6's 6.049212. That can't be right because Li-6 should be lighter than He-6. Oh wait, perhaps I got the notation wrong. Maybe Li-6 is not a stable isotope? Or perhaps I'm confusing the isotopes.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have used the atomic masses for He-6 and Li-6 from a standard table.

Wait, I think a better approach might be to look for the exact masses. Let me think: He-6 is ^6_2 He which is 6.01512 u. Li-6 is ^6_3 Li which is 6.04782 u? Wait, that doesn't make sense either because that would be He-6 (6.01512 u) being more massive than Li-6 (6.04782 u), which can't be right.

Hmmm, perhaps I should double-check the isotopes. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the isotopes. Let me think— actually, wait, He-6 is actually the same as ^6_2 He, which is the same as Li-6, because Li has 3 p and 3 n. So wait, that can't be right because Li-6 would have 3 p, 3 n, same as He-6. But that would imply they have the same mass, which is not possible. So perhaps I'm wrong about the notation.

Wait, perhaps He-6 is not ^6_2 He? No. Let me think again: ^A_Z X. So for He, Z=2, so it's ^6_2 He → 2 protons and 4 neutrons. Li has Z=3, so ^6_3 Li would have 3 p and 3n → 6 u.

Wait, but according to the atomic masses, Li-6 is 6.04782 u. So He-6 is 6.01512 u, Li-6 is 6.04782 u. Oh, wait, that would mean Li-6 is more massive than He-6, which can't be right. So perhaps I messed up the isotopes.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, He-6 is ^6_2 He, which is 2 protons and 4 neutrons. Li-6 is ^6_3 Li, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, He-6 has a higher mass than Li-6 because it has more neutrons. So that makes sense.

So, the parent is He-6 (6.01512 u) → daughter is Li-6 (6.04782 u). Wait, but that would make the daughter heavier than the parent, which can't happen in a decay. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation. Maybe He-6 is a different isotope. No, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me just proceed with the mass difference.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me get back to the problem. The maximum kinetic energy is the difference in mass between the parent and daughter, multiplied by c^2.

So, delta m = mass of parent (He-6) - mass of daughter (Li-6). So if parent is 6.01512 u and daughter is 6.04782 u, delta m would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So I must have the masses wrong. Maybe the parent is Li-6 and the daughter is He-6? No, that would make the daughter heavier, which can't happen.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the isotopes. Let me think about the exact mass of He-6.

Upon a quick check, I think the atomic mass of He-6 (Helium-6) is 6.01512 u. And the atomic mass of Li-6 (Lithium-6) is 6.047823 u. So, the parent (He-6) is 6.01512 u, daughter (Li-6) is 6.047823 u. So, the delta m is 6.047823 -6.01512 = 0.032703 u. 

Wait, but that would mean the daughter is heavier than the parent, which can't happen in a decay. So I'm clearly making a mistake here, but I can't figure it out. Maybe I'm confusing the isotopes. Perhaps the parent is He-4, not He-6. Oh wait, but the question says He^6, so parent is He-6.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered the isotope with a higher mass as the parent. No, He-6 is more massive than Li-6. Let me think again. If the parent is He-6 (6.01512 u) and the daughter is Li-6 (6.04782 u), that would imply the daughter is heavier, but that can't happen because a neutron converts into a proton. Wait, no, the daughter should be Li-6, which is heavier than He-6 because it has more neutrons.

Wait, but that's impossible because He-6 is He with 6 neutrons? No, because He has Z=2, so it's 2 protons and 4 neutrons, making 6 in total. So He-6 is 6.01512 u.

Li-6 is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So mass is 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

So the mass of the daughter is higher than the parent, which can't happen in a decay. So I must have the masses wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the isotopes wrong.

Wait, perhaps the He-6 parent is actually He-5. Let me check: No, the question states He^6, so it must be He-6.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the parent and daughter. Let me think again: He-6 decays via beta minus to Li-6. That's impossible because Li-6 is heavier. So perhaps the correct daughter is a different isotope. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about the decay. Oh wait, perhaps the parent is He-4, which would make more sense. But the question says He^6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-6, but that is impossible because Li-6 is more massive. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parent and daughter. Let me double-check the decay. He-6 → Li-6 + e^- + ν̄.

Wait, but that would mean the daughter is Li-6, which is heavier. So perhaps I should reconsider: perhaps the parent is He-5, and the daughter is Li-5. Wait, He-5 has 5 protons and 1 neutron (since 5=2+3? No, wait, 5=2+3 for He-5: Z=2, A=5 → 2 protons, 3 neutrons. So mass of He-5 is 2*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) = 2.014552 +3.025995→5.040547 u.

Li-6 is 3 protons, 3 neutrons → 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) = 6.047823 u.

Wait, the parent is He-5 (5.040547 u), daughter is Li-6 (6.047823 u). So the mass difference is 6.047823 -5.040547 = 1.007276 u.

Wait, that's a big mass difference. So delta m is 1.007276 u. That would give a maximum kinetic energy of about 1.007276 MeV, which is about 1 MeV. But wait, that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are A) ~4 MeV, B) ~5 MeV, C) ~1 MeV, D) ~2 MeV.

So, according to this, the maximum kinetic energy would be about 1 MeV, which matches option C.

But wait, my calculation must be incorrect because the difference between He-5 and Li-6 is 1.007276 u, which is about 1 MeV. But wait, let me think again. Wait, 1.007276 u is about 1 MeV, but wait, the mass of a proton is about 1 u. So 1 u is the mass of a proton. So, 1.007276 u is about 1.007 MeV. But actually, the exact conversion is 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². So, 1.007 u = 931.5 * 1.007 ≈ 937.3 MeV.

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options. So I must be making a mistake in the calculation.

Ah, wait, perhaps I mixed up the parent and daughter. Let me try again.

If the parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-6, that would require He-6 → Li-6, which can't happen because it's an isotope heavier.

So perhaps I should have considered a different scenario. Maybe the parent is He-4 and the daughter is Li-4? But that can't happen either.

Alternatively, perhaps the parent is He-5 and the daughter is Li-5. Then, the mass difference is 1.007276 u.

Wait, but that's not leading to any of the options. So perhaps I'm getting the decay wrong. Maybe the parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-5, but that would require a different decay path.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the beta decay equation. The maximum kinetic energy is given by E_max = (Δm c²), where Δm is the mass difference between the parent and daughter.

So, I need to calculate the mass difference between He-6 and Li-6.

Wait, He-6 is ^6_2 He, which is 2 protons and 4 neutrons. Li-6 is ^6_3 Li, which is 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So, mass of He-6 = (2 * 1.007276) + (4 * 1.008665) = 2.014552 +4.03466 → 6.049212 u.

Mass of Li-6 = (3 *1.007276) + (3 * 1.008665) =3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

So delta m = 6.049212 -6.047823 = 0.001389 u.

Ah, okay, so the mass difference is 0.001389 u.

But wait, wait, if the parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-6, that would require a neutron to turn into a proton. But wait, He-6 has 4 neutrons. So, if a neutron converts into a proton, that would give He-5, which is 5 protons and 1 neutron. So that would be Li-5, which is ^5_3 Li.

So, perhaps I'm confusing the isotopes here. Let me think about the correct decay path.

He-6 (Z=2, A=6) decays to Li-6 (Z=3, A=6), which is impossible because Li-6 is heavier. So instead, He-6 decays via beta minus to Li-5 (Z=3, A=6), which would be a decay that releases an electron and a neutrino.

So the correct decay is He-6 → Li-5 + β− + ν̄.

So the parent is He-6, the daughter is Li-5.

Now, let me find the masses.

He-6 is ^6_2 He, 6 protons and 0 neutrons? No, wait, He-6 has Z=2, so 2 protons and 4 neutrons.

Li-5 is ^5_3 Li, which has 3 protons and 2 neutrons.

So, mass of He-6 is 2*(1.007276) +4*(1.008665) =2.014552 +4.03466=6.049212 u.

Mass of Li-5 is 3*(1.007276) +2*(1.008665)=3.021828 +2.01733=5.039158 u.

So delta m =6.049212 -5.039158=1.010054 u.

Wait, that's a more reasonable mass difference. Now, to find the maximum kinetic energy, we multiply delta m by c^2.

So, delta m =1.010054 u.

So, E_max =1.010054 u *931.5 MeV/u = let's calculate that.

1.010054 *931.5 = let's break it down.

1 *931.5 =931.5 MeV.

0.010054 *931.5 = approx 9.38 MeV.

So, total E_max ≈931.5 +9.38 =940.88 MeV.

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options. So this suggests that my approach is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the decay path. Let me think again.

He-6 decays via beta minus to Li-6? No, that's impossible because Li-6 is heavier. So the correct decay is He-6 → Li-5 + β− + ν̄.

So, the parent is He-6, and the daughter is Li-5.

So, mass of He-6 is 6.049212 u.

Mass of Li-5 is 5.039158 u.

So, delta m =6.049212 -5.039158=1.010054 u.

So, E_max =1.010054 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Let me compute that.

1.010054 *931.5 = let me compute 1.010054 *931.5.

Let me first compute 1 *931.5 =931.5.

Then, 0.010054 *931.5.

Compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.000054 *931.5≈0.0503.

So, 9.315 +0.0503≈9.365.

So, 931.5 +9.365≈940.865 MeV.

That's way higher than any of the options, so I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm confusing the parent and daughter isotopes. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct parent is Li-5 and the daughter is He-6? No, that's not possible because He-6 is heavier.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the maximum kinetic energy formula again.

The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron in a beta minus decay is given by:

K_max = (Δm c²) / c² = (Δm) (MeV)

So, we need to find the mass difference between the parent and daughter.

So, if the parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-5, then the mass difference is 6.049212 u -5.039158 u =1.010054 u.

So, K_max =1.010054 MeV.

Wait, but that's about 1 MeV, which is option C. But earlier, I thought that the mass difference was 0.001389 u, but that led to a K_max of about 1.3 MeV, which is higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parent and daughter isotopes. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-6, but that's impossible because Li-6 is heavier. So, perhaps I should think that the parent is Li-6 and the daughter is He-6. But that's impossible because He-6 is more massive.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the isotopes. Let me think of the correct parent and daughter for He-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct parent is He-5 and the daughter is Li-5. So, He-5 is 5.040547 u, and Li-5 is 5.039158 u. So, the mass difference is 5.040547 -5.039158 =0.001389 u.

So, K_max=0.001389 u *931.5 MeV/u =approx 1.3 MeV.

Which is about 1.3 MeV, which is higher than any of the options.

So, in that case, perhaps the correct parent is He-4 and the daughter is Li-4.

Wait, He-4 has 4 u, Li-4 has 4 u as well, so the mass difference is zero. So K_max=0 MeV. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the correct parent is He-5 and the daughter is Li-5, giving a K_max of about 1.3 MeV, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the He-6 decaying to Li-5, giving a K_max of approximately 1.3 MeV, which is not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the mass difference is 0.001389 u, which gives a K_max of about 1.3 MeV.

But none of the options are near 1.3 MeV. The closest option is C, which is 1 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the decay path.

Wait, if the parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-5, and the mass difference is 1.010054 u, then K_max=1.010054 MeV.

But that's higher than any of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass difference.

Let me re-calculate the mass difference between He-6 and Li-5.

He-6: 6 protons and 0 neutrons → 6 u.

Li-5: 3 protons and 2 neutrons → 3*(1.007276) + 2*(1.008665)=3.021828 +2.01733=5.039158 u.

So, delta m=6.049212 -5.039158=1.010054 u.

So, K_max=1.010054 MeV.

But that's about 1.01 MeV, which is higher than any of the options given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using atomic masses instead of exact masses. Let me think about the exact masses.

He-6: 2*(1.007276) +4*(1.008665)=2.014552 +4.03466=6.049212 u.

Li-5:3*(1.007276) +2*(1.008665)=3.021828 +2.01733=5.039158 u.

So, delta m=1.010054 u.

K_max=1.010054 MeV ≈1.01 MeV.

Which is higher than any of the options given. The options are A) ~4 MeV, B) ~5 MeV, C) ~1 MeV, D) ~2 MeV.

So, the only option that is close is C) ~1 MeV.

But wait, why is the mass difference 1.010054 u? Because the parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-5, which is lighter.

So, K_max=1.010054 MeV.

Wait, but that's about 1 MeV, so option C is correct.

But wait, earlier I thought that the mass difference would be 0.001389 u, which would give a K_max of about 1.3 MeV, but that's incorrect because the correct parent and daughter isotopes are He-6 and Li-5.

So, the correct K_max is about 1.01 MeV, which is close to option C.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is using the atomic masses of the parent and daughter as given, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the parent and daughter isotopes.

Wait, perhaps the correct parent is He-6 and the daughter is Li-5, giving a K_max of about 1.01 MeV.

So, the correct answer would be C) ~1 MeV.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that the mass difference would be 0.001389 u, but that's incorrect because the correct isotopes are He-6 and Li-5.

So, the correct answer is C) ~1 MeV.
</think>

To determine the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron in the β⁻ decay of He^6, we use the formula:

\[
K_{\text{max}} = (\Delta m) c^2
\]

where \( \Delta m \) is the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei, and \( c^2 \) is the conversion factor from mass to energy. The mass difference is calculated as:

\[
\Delta m = (m_{\text{parent}} - m_{\text{daughter}})
\]

### Step 1: Identify the parent and daughter isotopes
The problem specifies that He^6 decays via β⁻ emission to a daughter nucleus. The correct isotopes for the decay are:
- **Parent**: He-6 (\(^6_2\) He)
- **Daughter**: Li-5 (\(^5_3\) Li)

### Step 2: Calculate the masses of the parent and daughter
The atomic masses are:
- \( m(\text{He-6}) = 6.049212 \, \text{u} \)
- \( m(\text{Li-5}) = 5.039158 \, \text{u} \)

The mass difference is:

\[
\Delta m = m(\text{He-6}) - m(\text{Li-5}) = 6.049212 - 5.039158 = 1.010054 \, \text{u}
\]

### Step 3: Convert the mass difference to energy
Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the maximum kinetic energy is:

\[
K_{\text{max}} = (1.010054 \, \text{u}) \times (931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2) = 940.86 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated \( K_{\text{max}} \) is approximately \( 940.86 \, \text{MeV} \), which is significantly higher than any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) ~1 MeV**, which aligns with the magnitude of the mass difference.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:

**C) ~1 MeV**
