Okay, so I've got this problem about overhead costs for a company called Johnson Supply. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The company distributes its $3,160 of overhead based on square footage occupied. The question is asking me to find out how much each department gets charged, based on their respective areas. The departments are Raw Materials, Manufacturing, Storage, and Administrative. Their areas are 2,500, 5,000, 2,000, and 500 square feet respectively.

Hmm, I remember that overhead allocation usually uses a rate. Oh right, they calculate the overhead rate by dividing the total overhead by the total square footage. Then each department applies this rate to their area.

So first, let me compute the overhead rate. The total overhead is $3,160 and the total square footage is 2,500 + 5,000 + 2,000 + 500. Let me add those up: 2,500 + 5,000 is 7,500; plus 2,000 makes 9,500. Then plus 500 is 10,000. So total square footage is 10,000 sq. ft.

Now, the overhead rate is $3,160 divided by 10,000. Let me calculate that. 3160 divided by 10,000 is 0.316 dollars per square foot. Or wait, 3160/10000 is 0.316. Hmm, yes.

Wait, but sometimes overhead rates are rounded. Like, perhaps we can use 0.316 or maybe round to 0.32 or something. Let me check the calculations again. 10,000 square feet. 3160 /10,000 = 0.316 per sq ft. So each square foot costs $0.316.

Now, each department's allocation is their area multiplied by the overhead rate. So for each area:

1. Raw Materials: 2,500 sq ft. So 2500 * 0.316.
Let me compute that. 2500 * 0.3 is 750, and 2500 * 0.016 is 40. So total 750 + 40 = 790. So $790.

2. Manufacturing: 5,000 sq ft. So 5000 * 0.316. 5000 * 0.3 is 1500, 5000 * 0.016 is 80. So 1500 + 80 = 1580.

3. Storage: 2,000 sq ft. 2000 * 0.316. 2000*0.3 is 600, 2000*0.016 is 32. So 600 +32=632.

4. Administrative: 500 sq ft. 500*0.316. 500*0.3=150, 500*0.016=8. So 150 +8=158.

Wait, but let me double-check these calculations. Let me compute each one accurately.

Wait, maybe I should do it more precisely. Let me compute each area multiplied by 0.316:

- 2500 * 0.316 = ?

First, 2500 * 0.3 = 750.

2500 * 0.016 = 40, because 2500 * 0.01=25, so 25*1.6=40.

So 750 +40=790. So that's correct.

- 5000 * 0.316: 5000 * 0.3 is 1500, 5000 * 0.016 is 80. So 1500+80=1580.

- 2000 * 0.316: 2000 *0.3=600, 2000 *0.016=32. 600+32=632.

- 500 *0.316: 500*0.3=150, 500*0.016=8. 150+8=158.

So the initial calculations look correct.

Looking at the options, let's see what each option gives.

Option H: 780, 1560, 630, 155.

Wait, our calculation for Administrative is 158, but option H says 155. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the overhead rate again. Because 3160 divided by 10,000 is 0.316. So 500 sq ft would be 500 * 0.316.

Wait, 500 * 0.316 = 158. So that's correct, but in the options, I don't see 158 in the last column. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option H: Administrative is $155.

Option G: Administrative is $160.

Option J: Administrative is $140.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total square footage. Let me recalculate that.

Areas: 2500 +5000 = 7500. 2000 +500=2500. 7500 +2500=10,000. So yes, 10,000 square feet.

So 3160 /10,000 = 0.316 per sq ft.

Now, let me compute each department:

1. 2500 sq ft: 2500 * 0.316 = ?

Wait, 2500 * 0.316: Let me compute it as 2500 * 0.3 is 750, and 2500 *0.016 is 40, so total 790. So that's correct.

2. 5000 *0.316= 1580.

3. 2000 *0.316=632.

4. 500 *0.316=158.

So the amounts are 790, 1580, 632, 158.

Looking at the options, which one has these numbers? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option H: 780, 1560, 630, 155. No.

Option G: 750, 1550, 600, 160. No.

Option F: 790, 1580, 632, 158. Oh! Wait, option F is 790, 1580, 632, 158. But the last number is 158, but the options list the last number for each option. Let me see.

Option F: 790 (Raw), 1580 (Manu), 632 (Storage), 158 (Admin).

Wait, but in our calculation, Administrative is 158. So the last number should be 158, but in option F, it's 158. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me look at the other options.

Option H: Administrative is 155, which is different.

Option B: Administrative is 170, which is too high.

Option I: Administrative is 170. No, our calculation is 158.

Option J: Administrative is 140. No.

Option D: Administrative is 165.

Option E: Administrative is 170. No.

Hmm, so the correct numbers would be 790, 1580, 632, 158. Looking for which option has these.

Option F has 790, 1580, 632, 158. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, let me check the other options again.

Looking at option H: Administrative is 155. That's off by 3 dollars. So probably not.

Option G has Administrative at 160, so no.

Wait, but what about the other options. Let me check option I: Administrative is 170. No.

Wait, is there any option that matches 790, 1580, 632, 158?

Looking at option F, yes. Option F's Administrative is 158.

So the correct answer is option F. But wait, wait, wait. Let me look again.

Wait, the question is about the last character of the response must be the letter chosen. So the answer options are A to J, each with four numbers, and we need to choose the correct one.

So according to my calculations, the correct amounts are 790, 1580, 632, 158.

Looking back at the options:

Option F: 790, 1580, 632, 158. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait! Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation for Administrative:

500 *0.316= 500 *0.3 is 150, 500 *0.016 is 8. 150+8=158. So that's correct.

So option F is the correct one.

To determine the amount charged to each department, the overhead rate is calculated by dividing the total overhead ($3,160) by the total square footage (10,000 sq. ft.), resulting in $0.316 per square foot. Each department's allocation is then calculated by multiplying their respective square footage by this rate:

1. **Raw Materials (2,500 sq. ft.):**  
   2,500 * 0.316 = **$790**.

2. **Manufacturing (5,000 sq. ft.):**  
   5,000 * 0.316 = **$1,580**.

3. **Storage (2,000 sq. ft.):**  
   2,000 * 0.316 = **$632**.

4. **Administrative (500 sq. ft.):**  
   500 * 0.316 = **$158**.

Among the provided options, **Option F** matches the calculated amounts: $790, $1,580, $632, $158.
