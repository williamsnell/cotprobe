Question:

On January 1, 1964, Stead and Company purchased a delivery truck for $4,000. It is estimated that the truck will have a useful life of four years, and that at the end of that time it will have a salvage value (resale value) of $400. It is expected that the truck will be used for 72,000 miles. Find the depreciation per year, if the truck was used for 20,000 miles during the first year, 25,000 miles during the second year, 18,000 miles during the third year and 9,000 miles during the fourth year. Use the units of production method for determining depreciation.

Okay, so I have this problem about depreciation using the units of production method. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that on January 1, 1964, Stead and Company bought a delivery truck for $4,000. The useful life is four years, and it can be sold for $400 at the end of that time. The truck is expected to be used for 72,000 miles. In the first year, they drove it 20,000 miles; second year, 25,000; third year, 18,000; and fourth year, 9,000 miles.

I remember that the units of production method calculates depreciation based on the actual usage of the asset. So, the formula I think is similar to straight-line but instead of dividing by the useful life, you divide by the total units expected to be used.

The formula for depreciation per unit is (Cost - Salvage Value) / Total estimated units. So, the first thing I need to compute is the depreciable cost. The cost is $4,000, and the salvage value is $400. So, $4,000 minus $400 is $3,600. That's the depreciable cost.

Next, the total estimated units are 72,000 miles. So, the depreciation per mile would be $3,600 divided by 72,000 miles. Let me calculate that: 3600/72000. Hmm, 72,000 divided by 100 is 720, so 3600 ÷ 720 is 5. So, per mile depreciation is $0.005? Wait, wait, that's 5 cents per mile. But let me double-check: 72,000 x 0.005 is 360, and 4000 - 360 is 3640. That's not right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate that division. 3,600 divided by 72,000. Let me do it step by step. 72,000 divided by 100 is 720. So, 3,600 ÷ 720 = 5. So yes, 3,600 /72,000 = 0.05, so $0.05 per mile. Wait, that's 5 cents per mile. That seems low, but maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of fractions. Another approach: 3,600 /72,000. Let's see, 72,000 divided by 3,600 is 20. So, 3,600/72,000 is 1/20, which is 0.05. So yes, $0.05 per mile.

But wait, let's make sure. 72,000 miles on the truck, each mile costing $0.05. So 72,000 * 0.05 = 3,600. Which matches the depreciable cost. So that's correct.

Now, for each year, the depreciation is mileage used multiplied by $0.05 per mile.

Let's compute each year's depreciation.

Year 1: 20,000 miles. So, 20,000 * $0.05 = $1,000.

Year 2: 25,000 miles. 25,000 * 0.05 = $1,250. Wait, but the options don't have $1,250, so wait—maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the options.

Wait the options are A: 1500, B:1000, C:2000, D:1200, etc. So I see option B is $1,000, which matches my first year's calculation. But what about the other years?

Year 3: 18,000 miles. 18,000 * 0.05 is 900. That's $900, which isn't an option either. Wait, all options except for B are higher.

Year 4: 9,000 miles. 9,000 *0.05 is $450. None of the options match this either. So perhaps I made a mistake in how I calculated per unit cost.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the per unit calculation. Let me recount: depreciable amount is $3,600 over 72,000 miles. So $3,600 /72,000 = $0.05 per mile. So that's correct.

Wait, but the question says to use the units of production method. Oh, wait, perhaps I should have considered the total units as 72,000, so yes, per mile is correct.

Hmm wait, is there another way this could be calculated? Maybe by considering the total expected miles and the total depreciable cost, and then the rate per mile.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the depreciation rate per mile as (Cost - Salvage) / Total miles, which is $3,600 /72,000 = $0.05 per mile. So that's correct.

Wait, but the problem asks for the depreciation per year, which is the amount subtracted each year.

So, year 1: 20,000 * $0.05 = $1,000. That's option B.

Year 2: 25,000 * 0.05 = $1,250. Not in the options.

Wait, none of the options have $1,250, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the total number of units used each year as the sum of the mileage, and then compute the depreciation based on that.

Wait, but the problem says, "the truck was used for 20,000 miles during the first year, 25,000 miles during the second year, 18,000 miles during the third year and 9,000 miles during the fourth year." So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the depreciation is calculated using straight-line, but then again, why would the options not have a $1,000, which is what I calculated for the first year.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the per unit calculation. Let me re-calculate $3,600 /72,000 miles.

3,600 divided by 72,000: Let's compute 72,000 ÷ 3,600.

Wait, 3,600 x 20 is 72,000. So 1/20 is 0.05, yes. So $0.05 per mile.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I can compute each year's depreciation again.

Year 1:20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000. So option B is correct.

Year 2:25,000 *0.05=1250. Not an option.

Year3:18,000 *0.05=900. Not an option.

Year4:9,000 *0.05=450. Not an option.

So the only option that matches is B: $1,000. So the answer should be B.

Wait but let me double-check if I'm using the correct units. Oh, wait, perhaps there's a different way to calculate, like considering the total units over the life.

Wait, another way to compute the depreciation is to find the depreciation rate per mile, which is $0.05, as before. So each year's depreciation is miles driven * $0.05.

So, let me compute each year's depreciation again.

Year 1: 20,000 * 0.05 = 1,000. So $1,000. That's option B.

Year 2:25,000 *0.05=1,250. Not an option.

Year3:18,000 *0.05=900. Not an option.

Year4:9,000 *0.05=450. Not an option.

So, all the other years' depreciation amounts are not in the options. So the only matching is B: $1,000.

Wait, but wait another thing. I remember sometimes, when using units of production, the depreciation per unit is (Cost - Salvage) / Total units, but sometimes it's done in a way that the total units are the sum of all units used during the asset's life. So that's what I did.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the total units, or perhaps the cost is different.

Wait, wait, the cost is $4,000, which is the initial cost. Then, the salvage value is $400. So, the depreciable amount is $3,600, correct.

So the per mile rate is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total depreciation over the four years.

Total depreciation would be 4 years * $1,000 = $4,000. But the total depreciable amount is $3,600. Hmm, that's a problem. Because 4 years * $1,000 would be $4,000, which is more than the depreciable amount of $3,600.

Wait, that's a contradiction. Did I mess up the per-mile calculation?

Wait, let's recalculate per mile again. $3,600 depreciable divided by 72,000 miles: 3600 /72000 = 0.05. That's correct.

So each mile is $0.05. So for 20,000 miles, $1,000. That's correct.

But over four years, 20k +25k +18k +9k =72k, which is the total miles. So, 72,000 miles. So, over four years, the total depreciation is 72,000 * $0.05 = $3,600, which matches the depreciable amount.

Ah, so that makes sense. Because 72,000 miles * $0.05 = $3,600, which is exactly the depreciable cost. So each year's depreciation is cumulative. So, the first year is 20,000 *0.05 =1000, second 25k*0.05=1250, third 9k*0.05=450, fourth 9k*0.05=450. But wait, adding these up: 1000+1250 =2250, plus 450 is 2700, plus 450 is 3150. Wait, that's only $3,150, but the depreciable cost is $3,600. So that can't be right. But wait, the total miles are 72,000, so the total depreciation should be 72,000 * $0.05 = $3,600.

Hmm, that indicates that my previous approach is wrong. That can't be right. Because if each mile is $0.05, then 72,000 *0.05 is $3,600. So the sum of all four years' depreciation must be $3,600.

Wait, but according to my calculation: 20k *0.05=1,000; 25k *0.05=1,250; 18k *0.05=900; 9k *0.05=450. Adding those: 1000+1250=2250; 2250+900=3150; 3150+450=3600. Oh wait, that adds up to $3,600. So that's correct.

Wait, so why was I confused earlier? Because I thought the total over four years would be 72,000 *0.05=3,600. So that's correct. So each year's depreciation is accurate.

So, each year's depreciation is as I calculated. So, year 1: $1,000. Year 2: $1,250. Year3: $900. Year4: $450.

But the options don't have 1,250. The only option that matches is B: $1,000.

But wait, let me read the question again. It says, "the truck was estimated to have a useful life of four years." So, that's correct. And the units used are 20,000, etc.

Wait, but the question says 'the truck was used for 20,000 miles during the first year, 25,000 the second, etc.' So, the per-mile rate is correct.

So, the correct answer is B, which is $1,000. So, the answer is option B.

To determine the depreciation per year using the units of production method, we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the depreciable cost**:  
   The truck was purchased for $4,000 and has a salvage value (resale value) of $400.  
   Depreciable cost = Cost - Salvage Value = $4,000 - $400 = $3,600.

2. **Calculate the depreciation per mile**:  
   The truck is expected to be used for 72,000 miles.  
   Depreciation per mile = Depreciable cost / Total estimated miles = $3,600 / 72,000 miles = $0.05 per mile.

3. **Compute the annual depreciation**:  
   Multiply the depreciation per mile by the number of miles driven each year.  
   - **Year 1**: 20,000 miles × $0.05 = $1,000.  
   - **Year 2**: 25,000 miles × $0.05 = $1,250.  
   - **Year 3**: 18,000 miles × $0.05 = $900.  
   - **Year 4**: 9,000 miles × $0.05 = $450.  

4. **Verify total depreciation**:  
   Sum the depreciation for all four years: $1,000 + $1,250 + $900 + $450 = $3,600, which matches the depreciable cost.  

5. **Match the result to the options**:  
   The only depreciation amount matching the options is $1,000 for the first year.
