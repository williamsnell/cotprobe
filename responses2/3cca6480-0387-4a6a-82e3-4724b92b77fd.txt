Okay, so I've got this research question here. Let me read it again. The researcher is testing problem-solving skills on participants who are 10, 20, and 30 years old. There are 20 participants in each age group. The question is, what research method is this researcher using?

Hmm, let's break this down. The options are A through J, each a different research method. I need to figure out which one fits the scenario described.

First, the scenario is about testing problem-solving skills across different age groups. So, the researcher is looking at how age affects problem-solving abilities. They're using a group of participants, varying in age, and measuring their problem-solving skills.

What are the different research methods here? Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Survey. A survey is a method where participants are asked questions. Here, the researcher is assessing problem-solving skills, which involves measurements and observations, not just yes/no answers. So maybe not a survey.

Option B: Experimental. That usually involves manipulating variables and testing outcomes. But in this case, the researcher isn't manipulating anything. They're just measuring problem-solving skills without any intervention. So probably not experimental.

Option C: Case study. This involves a detailed analysis of a single case or a group of cases. The researcher isn't looking at a single case but across different groups. So not a case study.

Option D: Stage. I think stages are more related to developmental stages, where a person goes through different stages. This doesn't fit here since the researcher is comparing different age groups, not stages of development.

Option E: Correlation. That's about measuring relationships between variables. The researcher is looking at the relationship between age and problem-solving skills. But it's not just measuring the relationship; it's assessing it across different groups. So maybe more than just correlation.

Option F: Cross-sectional. Cross-sectional studies collect data from a population at a specific point in time. The researcher is comparing different age groups at the same time, which is cross-sectional. So this seems like a possible fit.

Option G: Longitudinal. This is when the study follows the same subjects over time. The researcher isn't doing that; they're just measuring at one point across groups. So longitudinal might not be it.

Option H: Sequential. Sequential is about observing changes over time, usually in a sequence. Again, the same as longitudinal, not matching.

Option I: Ethnographic. This is about studying a community or environment through observation and description. It doesn't fit here since the researcher is looking at problem-solving skills in a controlled setting.

Option J: Developmental. This is similar to stage but more about growth and development over time. It's not about comparing different age groups but rather how a person develops. So probably not developmental.

Putting it all together: the researcher is comparing different groups (10, 20, 30) at the same time, measuring problem-solving skills. That's cross-sectional because it's a snapshot of the population at one moment, not tracking changes over time. It's not a correlation because it's comparing groups, not just looking at relationships. So the right answer is F: cross-sectional.

The researcher is assessing problem-solving skills across different age groups at a single point in time, comparing groups rather than tracking changes over time. This qualifies as a cross-sectional study.

Answer: F
