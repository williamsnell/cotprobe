Okay, so I have this NMR question here. Let me read it again. It says the T2 of an NMR line is 15 ms, and I need to calculate its linewidth, ignoring other sources of linebroadening. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that T2 is the lifetime of the NMR line, and linebroadening is related to that.

Wait, linebroadening refers to the spreading of a spectral line into a broader range of frequencies or energies. There are different sources of line broadening, like Doppler broadening, collisional broadening, etc. But in this question, it says to ignore other sources, so we only consider T2.

I think there's a formula that connects the lifetime (T2) with the linewidth (Δν). Oh right, the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics says that Δν * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but maybe for line broadening, it's Δν ≈ ħ/(pi * T2). Wait, or is it ħ/(2 T2)? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think. The uncertainty principle in quantum terms says that the product of the uncertainty in frequency (Δν) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is about ħ/2. So Δν ≈ ħ/(2Δt). But sometimes people approximate it as ħ/Δt, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the relation for line broadening is Δν ≈ 1/(2π T2), but I'm not certain.

Another approach: the natural linewidth (Δν_natural) is approximately 1/(pi * T2). But wait, in some sources, I've seen it as Δν ≈ ħ/(2pi * T2). Alternatively, maybe it's 1/(T2 * some factor). Let me think about the units.

Wait, T2 is in milliseconds, so 15 ms is 0.015 s. So how do I proceed?

Let me get the exact formula right. The natural linewidth is typically given by Δν = ħ/(2π T2), but wait, actually, I think it's Δν = (2.0026933 × 10^-6 s^-1) / T2. Wait, no, that's not right. I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, I remember that the line width in Hz is approximately 1/(pi*T2) because the natural linewidth is about 2.88/T2 (if T2 is in seconds). Wait, no, wait. Let me try to recall the correct formula.

Oh right, the formula I should use is Δν ≈ 1/(pi * T2). Because T2 is the lifetime, and the width is inversely proportional. So, for example, if T2 is 1 second, the natural linewidth is about 1/(pi * 1) ≈ 0.318 Hz. 

Wait, but wait, another possibility: The relation is Δν ≈ ħ/(2π T2). Let me compute that. 

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. So ħ/(2π) is about 1.0545718e-34 / (6.28319) ≈ 1.673e-35 J·s.

So if T2 is in seconds, Δν would be in Hz. So 1.673e-35 J·s / T2 (s) = Hz. 

So for T2 = 15 ms = 0.015 s:

Δν = (1.673e-35) / (0.015) ≈ 1.115e-33 Hz. Wait, that can't be right because the options are way higher. So that can't be the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses ħ/(pi*T2) instead. Let's check that.

ħ/(pi*T2) would be 1.673e-35 / (3.1416 * 0.015) ≈ 1.673e-35 / 0.04712 ≈ approx 3.54e-34 Hz. That's even smaller than before, which doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm, I must have the formula wrong. Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the line width is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle.

The uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty and time uncertainty is ħ/2. The energy uncertainty is ħΔν (because energy E = ħν, so ΔE ≈ ħΔν). So ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

So Δν ≈ (ħ/(2Δt)). 

Let's compute that. 

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

If T2 is 15 ms = 0.015 s.

Δν ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.015) 

= (1.0545718e-34) / 0.03 

≈ 3.515e-33 Hz.

Wait, that's way too small. The options are in Hz, but 3.5e-33 is way too tiny. So that can't be right. 

So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe it's the inverse. Let me consider that the natural linewidth is given by Δν ≈ 1/(T2 * (2π)).

Wait, 1/(T2 * 2π) would be 1/(0.015 * 6.283) ) → 1/(0.094245) ≈ 10.61 Hz. That's close to one of the options. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options, option E is 10.5 Hz. That matches approximately. But wait, is that the right formula?

Wait, the natural linewidth is indeed given by Δν = ħ/(2π T2). Let me compute that again.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So 1.0545718e-34 / (2 * π * 0.015) → 1.0545e-34 / (9.42477796) → approx 1.119e-35 Hz. That's even smaller than before, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm mixing up natural and full line broadening. Oh wait, natural line broadening is the full width at half maximum (FWHM), which is approximately 2.355 times the natural linewidth. So the FWHM is about 2.355 * (ħ/(2π T2)).

But the question isn't about FWHM; it's just the line width. So perhaps the correct formula for the line width is Δν ≈ ħ/(2π T2).

Wait, but if I compute that, it's about 1.05e-34 / (6.283 * 0.015) → approx 1.05e-34/(0.094245) ≈ 1.116e-33 Hz. That's way too small. So no, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Another approach: The formula for the line width in natural units is:

Δν ≈ 1/(π T2)

But let me compute that. 1/(π * 0.015) → 1/(0.04712) → approx 21.22 Hz. That's option G.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 1/(pi*T2) would be about 21 Hz. Let me double-check the calculation.

0.015 s → 15 ms.

1/(pi * 0.015) = 1/(0.04712) ≈ 21.22 Hz. So that's approximately 21.2 Hz, which is option G.

But wait, I thought earlier that the natural linewidth is ħ/(2π T2). Let me compute that again. 

So natural linewidth Δν = ħ/(2π T2)

But what is the value of ħ/(2π)? 

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

Divide by 2π (about 6.283) → 1.0545718e-34 /6.283 ≈ 1.673e-35 J·s.

So 1.673e-35 / 0.015 s → 1.115e-33 Hz. That's even smaller than before. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong units. Because T2 is in seconds, but the formula might require it in some other unit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The natural linewidth is given by Δν = (ħ)/(2π T2). So, 1e-34 / (2 * 3.1416 * 0.015) → 1e-34 / (0.094248) → around 1.06e-33 Hz. That's way too small, so that can't be right.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct formula is Δν ≈ 1/(pi*T2). Let me do that. 

So 1/(pi * 0.015) → 1/(0.04712) ≈ 21.22 Hz. So that's option G.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about linebroadening, I thought the formula was Δν ≈ 1/(pi T2), so that gives option G. But earlier I thought that the natural linewidth is ħ/(2 pi T2), which is about 1.67e-35/0.015 ≈ 1.1e-33 Hz, which is way too small. So perhaps the correct formula is 1/(pi*T2), which would give 21.22 Hz, option G.

Wait, but I've also heard that the line width is given by Δν ≈ 1/(pi*T2). That seems right because it's a standard formula. So the answer would be option G:21.2 Hz.

Looking at the options, option G is 21.2 Hz, which matches that.

To calculate the linewidth of an NMR line with a lifetime \( T_2 = 15 \, \text{ms} \), we use the relationship between line width and \( T_2 \). The natural linewidth, which is the full width at half maximum (FWHM), is approximately given by:

\[
\Delta \nu = \frac{1}{\pi T_2}
\]

Here, \( T_2 \) is in seconds. Converting \( T_2 = 15 \, \text{ms} \) to seconds:

\[
T_2 = 0.015 \, \text{s}
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Delta \nu = \frac{1}{\pi \cdot 0.015}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
\pi \cdot 0.015 \approx 0.04712
\]

Now, compute the linewidth:

\[
\Delta \nu = \frac{1}{0.04712} \approx 21.2 \, \text{Hz}
\]

This matches option G. The other options, such as \( 10.5 \, \text{Hz} \) (option E) or \( 30.1 \, \text{Hz} \) (option A), are inconsistent with the standard formula for line width in NMR. Therefore, the correct linewidth is \( 21.2 \, \text{Hz} \).
