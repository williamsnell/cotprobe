Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychosomatic disorders. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking about what a psychosomatic disorder is, how it's induced, and some examples. Then we have options from A to J. I remember that psychosomatic disorders are a type of mental health condition, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me break it down.

First, the definition. I think psychosomatic refers to the connection between the mind and the body. So, psychosomatic disorders are mental conditions that are caused by psychological factors, often leading to physical symptoms. That makes sense. So, they're a result of the mind influencing the body.

How are they induced? Induction would mean causing the disorder. If the mind is causing the body to act in a certain way, that's induction. So, psychological stress, fear, misunderstanding, etc., might trigger an underlying mental condition that results in physical symptoms. For example, if someone feels anxious (mental), their body might react by having trouble sleeping or causing physical symptoms.

Examples are important. Let's look at the options. Option E says it's a bodily disturbance caused by psychological stress. That sounds familiar. For instance, peptic ulcers could be due to stress from eating, which affects the digestive system. High blood pressure might be because of mental issues like anxiety causing stress in the body. Allergies come from exposure to allergens, which can be due to environmental factors, not psychological. So E seems like a good example.

Option H mentions broken bones, congenital heart defects, and type I diabetes as examples, all of which are physical conditions without a clear psychological cause. So H is another correct example.

Option J says it's a physical illness without a known cause. That's related to psychosomatic disorders because it's about the physical result of a mental issue.

Looking at the options again, I need to pick the correct answer. Let's see:

Option E: psychosomatic disorder induced by psychological stress, examples include peptic ulcers, high blood pressure, etc. That seems right.

Option H: broken bones, etc. That's a physical manifestation of a mental disorder.

Option E and H are both correct, but the question asks for a definition, how it's induced, and examples. So I need to find the best answer that covers all three aspects.

Wait, the question is phrased as "What is a psychosomatic disorder? How is it induced? Give some examples." So perhaps the best answer is E because it directly ties the disorder to psychological factors, and provides clear examples.

Option H is about the physical manifestation, but the question is about the disorder itself, not an example. So E is more about the disorder being a mental condition caused by psychological factors.

Another option, maybe option E is correct. Let me check the other options.

Option A: Deliberately produced. That doesn't sound right. Psychosomatic disorders are about the underlying cause, not deliberate production. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Cognitive impairments. That's more about mental issues leading to physical symptoms, but doesn't describe the disorder itself, which is psychological. So B isn't the right definition.

Option C: Any chronic disorder without symptoms. That's the opposite of psychosomatic. Psychosomatic disorders have symptoms, so C is wrong.

Option D: Treating with psychological methods. Not correct because psychosomatic disorders are about the underlying cause, not the treatment. So D is incorrect.

Option F: Causes solely by environment. No, because psychosomatic disorders are caused by psychological factors, not environment. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Mental disorder caused by physical issues. That's possible, but I think psychosomatic disorders are a subset of mental disorders, not necessarily caused by physical issues. So G might not be accurate.

Option I: Mental disturbance caused by emotional factors. That's a different angle, but psychosomatic disorders can be mental health issues, so I think they're a subset, but I'm not sure if the question includes that. The options are a bit ambiguous.

Option J: Physical without cause. That's more about the physical manifestation, not the disorder itself. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be E because it directly addresses the definition, how induced by psychological stress, and provides examples. Option E seems to cover all three aspects: definition, induction, and examples.

The correct answer is **E: A psychosomatic disorder is a bodily disturbance which is induced or aggravated by a psychological stress. Examples include peptic ulcers, high blood pressure, asthma, dermatitis, and obesity.**

**Explanation:**
- **Definition:** Psychosomatic disorders are mental health conditions caused by psychological factors, leading to physical symptoms.
- **Induction:** They are induced by psychological stress, such as anxiety, fear, or misunderstanding, which can trigger underlying mental issues.
- **Examples:** Examples include peptic ulcers (stress on the digestive system) and high blood pressure (stress on the cardiovascular system).

Other options either misdefine the disorder, describe physical manifestations incorrectly, or fall outside the scope of psychosomatic disorders. Option E accurately captures the essence of psychosomatic disorders.
