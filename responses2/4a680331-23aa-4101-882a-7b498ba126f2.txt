Okay, so I have this algebra problem here where I need to convert the quadratic equation 3x² + x -4 into the vertex form, which is a(x - h)² + k. And then I need to find out what k is. Hmm, I remember that vertex form is useful because it directly gives the vertex of the parabola, which is (h, k). But I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so I should probably go through it carefully.

First, the standard form is ax² + bx + c, and the vertex form is a(x - h)² + k. The coefficient 'a' stays the same, so in this case, it's 3. Now, I think the process involves completing the square. Let me try to recall how that works.

Starting with the equation: 3x² + x -4.

I think the first step is to factor out the coefficient of x² from the first two terms. So, factoring 3 out of 3x² + x would give me 3(x² + (1/3)x) -4. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 3 times x² is 3x², and 3 times (1/3)x is x. Yep, that's correct.

Now, inside the parentheses, I have x² + (1/3)x. To complete the square, I need to find a number that makes this a perfect square trinomial. The formula I remember is (b/2)², where b is the coefficient of x. Here, b is 1/3, so (1/3 divided by 2) squared is (1/6)², which is 1/36.

So, I need to add 1/36 inside the parentheses. But wait, since there's a factor of 3 outside, adding 1/36 inside actually adds 3*(1/36) = 1/12 to the equation. To keep the equation balanced, I must subtract the same amount outside. Let's write this step out.

So, the equation becomes 3(x² + (1/3)x + 1/36) -4 - (3*(1/36)). Calculating that, 3*(1/36) is 1/12, so the equation is 3(x + 1/6)² -4 -1/12.

Now, simplifying the constants: -4 is the same as -48/12, so subtracting 1/12 gives (-48/12 -1/12) = -49/12.

Putting it all together, the equation is 3(x + 1/6)² -49/12. But wait, the question wants it in the form a(x - h)² + k. The current form is 3(x + 1/6)² -49/12. I can rewrite +1/6 as -(-1/6), so that's x - (-1/6). So, it's 3(x - (-1/6))² -49/12.

So, in the vertex form, a is 3, h is -1/6, and k is -49/12. Therefore, the value of k is -49/12.

Looking at the options, option E is -49/12, so that must be the correct answer.

To express \( 3x^2 + x - 4 \) in vertex form \( a(x - h)^2 + k \), we complete the square. First, factor out 3 from the first two terms:

\( 3(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x) - 4 \).

Next, complete the square by adding \( \frac{1}{36} \) inside the parentheses, and adjust by subtracting \( 3 \times \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{12} \):

\( 3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4 - \frac{1}{12} \).

Simplify the constants:

\( 3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12} \).

Thus, \( k = -\frac{49}{12} \), so the correct option is E.
