Okay, so I have this question about finding the vector that spans the kernel of a matrix A. The matrix A is a 4x4 matrix, and I need to find which of the given options is a vector that, when multiplied by A, gives zero. The kernel, or null space, of a matrix consists of all vectors x such that Ax = 0. 

First, I remember that to find if a vector spans the kernel, I can multiply each option by the matrix A and see if the result is the zero vector. Alternatively, I could perform row reduction to find the eigenvectors, but since it's a kernel, probably the first approach is easier.

Wait, but how exactly do I do this? Let me think. Each option is a vector, so I need to compute A multiplied by each vector and check if the product is [0, 0, 0, 0].

Alternatively, another approach is to find the reduced row echelon form of A, and then see which columns correspond to pivot columns. The vectors that correspond to the free variables will form the basis for the kernel. But maybe that's more involved. For this problem, perhaps the direct method is better since the options are manageable.

So, I'll go through each option and see if A multiplied by it equals zero.

Option A: [1,2,3,4]. Let's compute each component:

First component: 1*1 + 2*0 +3*2 +4*4 = 1 + 0 +6 +16=23? No, that can't be right because if it's zero, it's 23, but that's not zero. Wait, maybe I should compute each row of A multiplied by the vector.

Wait, actually, I need to multiply each row of A by the vector. Let me recalculate.

Option A: [1,2,3,4]

First row of A: [1,0,2,4] multiplied by [1,2,3,4] is 1*1 + 0*2 + 2*3 +4*4 = 1 + 0 +6 +16=23. Not zero. So A is not a kernel vector.

Option B: [-1,2,0,3]

First row: -1*1 + 2*0 +0*2 +3*4 = -1 +0 +0 +12=11. Not zero.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute A multiplied by each vector to see if it's zero.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to perform row operations on A to find its kernel. But since the matrix is 4x4, it's a bit involved. Let me try.

Alternatively, I can note that the kernel is the solution space of A x = 0. So each option is a vector in that space.

So, perhaps a more efficient way is to compute A multiplied by each vector and see if it's zero.

Let me proceed step by step.

Option A: [1,2,3,4]

Compute each row of A multiplied by this vector.

Row 1: 1*1 + 0*2 + 2*3 +4*4 = 1 +0 +6 +16=23. Not zero.

So A is not in the kernel.

Option B: [-1,2,0,3]

Row 1: (-1)*1 + 0*2 +0*3 +3*4 = -1 +0 +0 +12=11. Not zero.

So B is not in the kernel.

Option C: [0,3,-3,1]

Row1: 0*1 +3*0 + (-3)*2 +1*4=0 +0 -6 +4= -2. Not zero.

So C is not in the kernel.

Option D: [3,-1,0,4]

Row1: 3*1 + (-1)*0 +0*2 +4*4=3 +0 +0 +16=19. Not zero.

Option E: [5,-2,1,4]

Row1:5*1 + (-2)*0 +1*2 +4*4=5 +0 +2 +16=23. Not zero.

Option F: [1,-1,2,0]

Row1:1*1 + (-1)*0 +2*2 +0*4=1 +0 +4 +0=5. Not zero.

Option G: [2,1,3,-1]

Row1:2*1 +1*0 +3*2 + (-1)*4=2 +0 +6 -4=4. Not zero.

Option H: [4,0,-2,1]

Row1:4*1 +0*0 + (-2)*2 +1*4=4 +0 -4 +4=4. Not zero.

Option I: [0,1,-1,2]

Row1:0*1 +1*0 + (-1)*2 +2*4=0 +0 -2 +8=6. Not zero.

Option J: [-2,3,1,0]

Row1: (-2)*1 +3*0 +1*2 +0*4= -2 +0 +2 +0=0. Okay, first row is zero.

Row2: [0,1,-3,-1] • [-2,3,1,0]

0*(-2) +1*3 + (-3)*1 + (-1)*0 = 0 +3 -3 +0=0.

Row3: [3,4,-6,8] • [-2,3,1,0] =3*(-2) +4*3 + (-6)*1 +8*0= (-6) +12 -6 +0= 0.

Row4: [0,-1,3,4] • [-2,3,1,0] =0*(-2) + (-1)*3 +3*1 +4*0= 0 -3 +3 +0=0.

So all rows in A multiplied by J give zero. So J is in the kernel.

Wait, but the question is which of the given options is a vector that spans the kernel. So J is the correct answer.

Wait, but I should check if any other options also satisfy. Let me check option D again.

Option D: [3,-1,0,4]

Row1:3*1 + (-1)*0 +0*2 +4*4=3+0+0+16=19 → Not zero.

So only option J has all rows zero when multiplied by it. So the answer should be J.

The question asks which vector spans the kernel of matrix \( A \). To determine this, we multiply each option by \( A \) and check if the result is the zero vector.

- **Option J**: \([-2, 3, 1, 0]\)  
  - Row 1: \(1*(-2) + 0*3 + 2*1 + 4*0 = -2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 0\).  
  - Row 2: \(0*(-2) + 1*3 + (-3)*1 + (-1)*0 = 0 + 3 - 3 + 0 = 0\).  
  - Row 3: \(3*(-2) + 4*3 + (-6)*1 + 8*0 = -6 + 12 - 6 + 0 = 0\).  
  - Row 4: \(0*(-2) + (-1)*3 + 3*1 + 4*0 = 0 - 3 + 3 + 0 = 0\).  
  All rows yield zero, so \( J \) is in the kernel.

Other options do not satisfy all rows being zero. Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
