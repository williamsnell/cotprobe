Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a steel rod and a miller machine. Hmm, let me think. I remember that stress and strain are related, and Young's modulus comes into play here. Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, find the stress, the strain, and the elongation. 

So the rod is 2.0 meters long and has a cross-sectional area of 0.30 cm². Wait, wait, cross-sectional area. Oh right, the area is in cm², but I need to convert that to m² for calculations. Because the standard units for stress are in Pascals, which is N/m². So 0.30 cm² is 0.3e-4 m² because 1 m² is (100 cm)^2, so 1 cm² is 0.0001 m². So 0.3 cm² is 0.3 * 1e-4 m², which is 3e-5 m².

The miller machine has a mass of 550 kg. The force applied would be mass times gravity. Oh, that's 550 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me compute that. 550 * 9.8 is, let's see, 500*9.8 is 4900, and 50*9.8 is 490, so total 5390 N. Wait, why 5390? Because 550 * 9.8 is 550*10=5500, minus 550*0.2=110. So 5500-110=5390. Yeah, so 5390 N.

Stress is force divided by area. So stress (σ) = F/A. F is 5390 N, A is 3e-5 m². So 5390 / 3e-5. Let me compute that. 5390 divided by 3e-5 is the same as 5390 / 0.00003. Hmm, wait, that's 5390 * (1/0.00003) = 5390 * 33333.333... Approximately. Let's see, 5390 * 3.333e4. Wait, 5390 is 5.39e3. 5.39e3 / 3e-5 = (5.39e3) / (3e-5) = (5.39 /3) * 1e8. 5.39/3 is about 1.7967. So 1.7967e8 Pascals. Wait, that's 179.67 MPa, but wait, that's way higher than steel's Young's modulus. Wait, wait, wait, steel's Young's modulus is around 200 GPa, right? So 179.67 MPa is way lower. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponent. Let me double-check.

Wait, 3e-5 is 0.00003. So 5390 divided by 0.00003 is 5390 / 0.00003 = 5390 * (1/0.00003) = 5390 * 33333.333... which is 5390 * 3.333e4 = 5390 * 33333.333. Let me calculate 5390 * 33333.333. Let's compute 5390 * 3.333e4 as 5390 * (10/3) * 1e4. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 5390 * 33333.333. Let me approximate: 5390 * 33333.333 is 5390 * (1e5/3) = 5390 * (33333.333) = let's see, 5390 * 33333 = 5390 * (3.333e4) = 5390 * 3.333e4. 5390 * 3.333 is 5390 * 1/3 * 1e4. So 5390 * 0.3333 is approx 5390 * 0.3333 = 1800 (since 5390 * 0.3 is 1617, 5390 *0.0333 is about 179. So 1617 +179 = 1796, so 1796 * 1e4 = 17960000 N/m². So about 1.796e7 Pa, which is 17.96 MPa. But wait, steel's Young's modulus is about 200 GPa, which is 200,000 MPa. Wait, wait, 200 GPa is 2e8 Pa (since 1 GPa is 1e9 Pa). Oh wait, no, wait: 200 GPa is 2e11 Pa? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 GPa is 1e9 Pa. So 200 GPa is 2e11 Pa? Wait, no, no. Wait, 1 GPa is 10^9 Pa, so 200 GPa is 2e11 Pa? Wait, wait no: 200 GPa is 200e9 Pa, which is 2e11 Pa. But our stress is 1.796e7 Pa, which is 17.96 MPa. So that's way less than the Young's modulus of steel. So the rod doesn't get stressed beyond its elastic limit, so that's okay.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the area. Let me recheck the cross-sectional area.

The problem states the cross-sectional area is 0.30 cm². So 0.30 cm² is 0.3e-4 m², as 1 cm² is 1e-4 m². So 0.3e-4 m² is 3e-5 m². So that part is correct.

So σ = 5390 N / 3e-5 m² = 5390 / 0.00003 = 5390 * (1/0.00003). 1/0.00003 is 33333.333..., so 5390 * 33333.333. Let me compute that. But wait, 5390 * 33333.333 is the same as 5390 * (33333 + 0.333) )? Wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute 5390 * 33333.333... as 5390 * 3.333e4.

Wait, 5390 * 3.333e4 = 5390 * 3.333 * 1e4. 5390 * 3.333: Let's compute 5390 * 3 = 16170, 5390 * 0.333 is approx 1796. So 16170 + 1796 = 17966. So 17966 * 1e4 = 179660000 Pa. Wait, but that's 179,660,000 Pa which is 179.66 MPa. That's 179.66 MPa. But wait, the Young's modulus of steel is about 200 GPa, which is 200,000 MPa. So this stress is well below the elastic limit, so it's okay, and the rod won't break.

So stress is about 179.66 MPa, which is 179.66e6 Pa. So the stress is 179.7 MPa.

Wait, but what if I messed up the area? Because 1 cm^2 is 0.0001 m². Oh wait, no. 1 m² is 100 cm x 100 cm = 1e4 cm². So 1 cm² is 1e-4 m². So 0.30 cm² is 0.3e-4 m². So 3e-5 m².

So, the calculation for stress is correct.

Now, strain is the change in length over the original length. The formula is strain (e) = ΔL / L. But ΔL is the elongation, which we need to find. Alternatively, since e = stress / Young's modulus (Y).

Young's modulus for steel is around 200 GPa, which is 2e10 Pa. Wait, no, 200 GPa is 2e10 Pa? Wait, wait. No, 1 GPa is 1e9 Pa. So 200 GPa is 2e11 Pa? No, wait, 200 * 1e9 Pa is 2e11 Pa. Wait, no. Let me think. 1 GPa = 1e9 Pascals. So 200 GPa is 200 * 1e9 Pa = 2e11 Pa. Wait no, wait 1e9 is 10^9, so 2e11 is 200,000,000,000 Pascals? No, wait 1e9 is 10^9, so 1e9 * 200 is 2e11. Oh wait, that's correct. Wait, 200 GPa is 2e11 Pa? Wait, no, 200 GPa is 200,000 MPa, which is 2e11 Pa. Wait, that seems way too high for a steel rod. Wait, no, wait, 200 GPa is 200,000 MPa. Wait, but steel's Young's modulus is around 200 GPa, so that's correct.

So, strain e = σ / Y. So e = (179.66e6 Pa) / (2e11 Pa) = 179.66e6 / 2e11 = (1.7966e8) / (2e11) = 0.0008983. Multiply by 1e-3? Wait, no, 179.66e6 is 1.7966e8, 2e11 is 2e11. So (1.7966e8) / (2e11) = (1.7966 / 2) * 1e-3. 1.7966 /2 is approx 0.8983. So 0.8983e-3 = 0.0008983. So strain is approximately 0.000898, or 0.0009 when rounded.

Wait, that's 0.0009, which is 0.09% strain. But wait, another way, let me compute the actual value more accurately.

σ is 5390 N / 0.3e-4 m². Let me compute that step by step.

0.3 cm² is 0.3 * 1e-4 m² = 3e-5 m². So 5390 / 3e-5 = 5390 / 0.00003. Let's compute 5390 / 3 = 1796.666..., so 1796.666...e7. Wait, because 1e-5 is 0.00001, so 5390 / 0.00003 = 5390 * (1 / 0.00003) = 5390 * 33333.333... Let me compute 5390 * 33333.333.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 5390 / 0.00003. Let's do the division:

5390 ÷ 0.00003 = 5390 * (100000 / 3) )= (5390 * 100000) /3 = 5390 * 100000 =5390000000, divided by 3 is 179,666,666.666... Pa, which is 179,666,666.67 Pa, approximately 179.6667 MPa.

Yes, so stress is about 179.67 MPa.

Now, Young's modulus Y for steel is about 200 GPa, which is 2e11 Pa.

Strain e = (179.6667e6) / (2e11) = (1.796667e8) / (2e11) = (1.796667 / 2) * 1e-3 = 0.8983335e-3 = 0.0008983335, which is approximately 0.000898, or 0.0898%.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 0.0898% as an option. Let me look back at the options. The options are:

A: 2.8

B: 1.3

C: 2.1

D: 1.8

E: 2.5

F: 3.6

G: 1.5

H: 3.9

I: 1.8

J: 3.2

Wait, wait. These numbers are in mm. Oh wait! Oh wait, the question says to give the strain and elongation in mm. Oh! Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. I calculated the strain as a decimal (0.000898), but the options are in mm. So perhaps I need to convert strain into mm.

Wait, strain is e = ΔL / L. So if e is 0.000898, then ΔL = e * L. L is 2.0 m, so ΔL = 0.000898 * 2.0 m = 0.001796 meters, which is 1.796 mm, approximately 1.8 mm.

So the strain is about 1.8e-3 (0.0018), which is 1.8 mm as a length change.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.8.

But wait, the options are numbers, not percentages. So the options are the numerical values of the elongation in mm. So for example, if the elongation is 1.8 mm, the option I is 1.8. So the correct answer would be option I (1.8 mm).

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the stress was about 179.67 MPa, and Y is 200 GPa. So the strain is 0.000898, which is 0.0898%, and the elongation is 1.796 mm, so approx 1.8 mm. So the correct answer is option I, which is 1.8.

To solve the problem, we calculate the stress, strain, and elongation of the steel rod under the given load. The rod has a length \( L = 2.0 \, \text{m} \), a cross-sectional area \( A = 0.30 \, \text{cm}^2 = 3.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2 \), and the mass of the miller machine is \( m = 550 \, \text{kg} \). The gravitational acceleration is \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

### Step 1: Calculate the force applied
The force \( F \) is the weight of the miller machine:
\[
F = m \cdot g = 550 \cdot 9.8 = 5390 \, \text{N}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the stress
Stress \( \sigma \) is given by:
\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{5390}{3.0 \times 10^{-5}} = 179,666,666.67 \, \text{Pa} \approx 179.67 \, \text{MPa}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the strain
Young's modulus for steel is \( Y = 200 \, \text{GPa} = 2 \times 10^{11} \, \text{Pa} \). Strain \( e \) is given by:
\[
e = \frac{\sigma}{Y} = \frac{179.67 \times 10^6}{2 \times 10^{11}} = 0.0008983.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the elongation
The elongation \( \Delta L \) is given by:
\[
\Delta L = e \cdot L = 0.0008983 \cdot 2.0 = 0.0017966 \, \text{m}.
\]
Converting to millimeters:
\[
\Delta L = 0.0017966 \, \text{m} = 1.7966 \, \text{mm}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the given options
The elongation \( \Delta L \) is approximately \( 1.8 \, \text{mm} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
