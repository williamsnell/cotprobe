Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles over 5 days, and she drove the same number of miles each day. I need to find out how many miles she drove each day. The options are A through J, with numbers like 15, 12, 5, and so on.

Hmm, so if she drove the same amount each day, this must be a division problem. Right, because she's splitting the total miles equally over the five days. So, I think I need to divide the total miles by the number of days.

Let me write that down. The total miles are 40, and the number of days is 5. So, I'll calculate 40 divided by 5. Let me do the math. 5 times 8 is 40, so 40 divided by 5 must be 8. So, she drove 8 miles each day.

Looking at the options, option I is 8. So that must be the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says she drove the same each day, so it's definitely a division. No multiplication or addition needed. 5 times 8 is 40, which matches the total. So yeah, I'm confident it's option I.
