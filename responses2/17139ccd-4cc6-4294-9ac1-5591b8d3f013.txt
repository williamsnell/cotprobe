Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the molarity of a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. 

Hmm, I remember that when you have an acid and a base reacting, they neutralize each other. The reaction between HCl (a strong acid) and NaOH (a strong base) should produce NaCl and water. The balanced equation is HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O. Right, so the mole ratio is 1:1. One mole of HCl reacts with one mole of NaOH.

Wait, the problem says that 42.6 mL of 0.108 M HCl is needed to neutralize 40.0 mL of the NaOH solution. Oh, so the volume of HCl is 42.6 mL, and its concentration is 0.108 M. I think I need to find the concentration of the NaOH instead.

I think the steps are: calculate the moles of HCl, then use the 1:1 mole ratio to find the moles of NaOH, and then divide by the volume of NaOH solution to get the molarity.

First, moles of HCl. Molarity is moles per liter, so moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). The volume is 42.6 mL, which is 0.0426 L. So moles of HCl = 0.108 M * 0.0426 L. Let me calculate that. 0.108 * 0.0426 = let's see, 0.1 * 0.04 is 0.004, but more precisely, 0.108 * 0.0426. Let me compute:

0.108 * 0.04 = 0.00432
0.108 * 0.0026 = approx 0.0002808
Adding them gives 0.00432 + 0.0002808 = 0.0046008 moles of HCl. Wait, wait, I think I should just compute it accurately.

Wait, 0.108 * 0.0426 = (0.1 * 0.0426) + (0.008 * 0.0426) → 0.00426 + 0.0003408 = 0.0046008 moles. So approximately 0.004601 moles of HCl.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH = same as moles of HCl, which is 0.004601 moles. 

Now, the volume of NaOH solution is 40.0 mL, which is 0.040 L. So the molarity is moles divided by liters. So 0.004601 / 0.040 = let's calculate that.

0.004601 / 0.040 = 0.115025 M. Hmm, wait, 0.004601 divided by 0.04 is the same as 4.601e-3 / 4e-2 = (4.601 /4) * 1e-1. Oh wait, 4.601 divided by 4 is approx 1.15025. So 1.15025 * 0.1 = 0.115025 M. So approximately 0.115 M. 

Looking at the options, I see option H is 1.64 M, option I is 0.115 M. So that's option I. But wait, did I do all the steps correctly? Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.108 M * 0.0426 L = 0.0046008 mol. NaOH: same moles, 0.0046008. Volume of NaOH is 0.040 L. So 0.0046008 / 0.04 = 0.11502 M. So yes, that's 0.115 M. So the answer should be option I.

To determine the molarity of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, we start with the balanced chemical equation:

**HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O**

From the reaction, the mole ratio of HCl to NaOH is 1:1. This means the moles of HCl are equal to the moles of NaOH in the solution.

1. **Calculate the moles of HCl:**
   - The volume of HCl is 42.6 mL, which is equivalent to 0.0426 L.
   - The molarity of HCl is 0.108 M.
   - Moles of HCl = \( 0.108 \, \text{M} \times 0.0426 \, \text{L} = 0.0046008 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine the moles of NaOH:**
   - Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH = moles of HCl = 0.0046008 mol.

3. **Calculate the molarity of NaOH:**
   - The volume of NaOH solution is 40.0 mL, which is equivalent to 0.040 L.
   - Molarity of NaOH = \( \frac{0.0046008 \, \text{mol}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.11502 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Compare with the options:**
   - The calculated molarity is approximately 0.115 M, which corresponds to option **I: 0.115 M**.
