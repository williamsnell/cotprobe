Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the thermal decomposition of a compound. The question is about finding the time when the total pressure reaches a certain value. Let's see, I remember that for these kinds of problems, we usually model the rate of reaction and integrate it to find the time.

The compound given is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3. When it decomposes, it breaks down into acetone and ethane. The reaction is probably a second-order reaction, given that the rate constant is provided. The initial pressure is 1.0 atm, and we want to find when the total pressure is 1.8 atm.

Wait, so the reaction is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → (CH3)2CO + C2H6. Let me think about the stoichiometry. On the left, there are two (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 molecules. On the right, each produces one acetone and one ethane. But wait, acetone has two (CH3)2CO groups, and ethane is a single molecule. Hmm, so the products are acetone and ethane.

Wait, no, acetone would be (CH3)2CO, and ethane is C2H6. So the equation would be:

(CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → (CH3)2CO + C2H6.

So for every mole of the starting material, one mole of acetone and one mole of ethane are produced. So the stoichiometric coefficients are 1:1:1. So the initial moles are 1.0 atm each (assuming ideal gas and same volume and temperature). But wait, the initial state is a gas phase reaction, so perhaps all the moles are in the gas phase. So the initial total pressure is 1.0 atm, but as the reaction proceeds, some of the starting material decomposes into products.

Wait, the initial state is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3, so it's a single molecule. At time t=0, the pressure is 1.0 atm.

After some time t, some of this molecule decomposes into acetone and ethane. So let's model the moles as a function of time.

Let me define the decomposition in terms of the extent of reaction. Let’s say 'x' is the number of moles of the starting material that have decomposed at time t. So, initially, we have (1.0) mole of the starting material. At time t, we'll have (1.0 - x) moles of the starting material, and x moles each of acetone and ethane.

But wait, the reaction is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → (CH3)2CO + C2H6. So each mole of starting material produces one mole acetone and one mole ethane. So, for every mole of starting material that decomposes, the number of moles increases in the products.

Wait, but what's the stoichiometry for the pressure change? Let's think in terms of moles. The initial pressure is 1.0 atm for the starting material. At time t, the moles of each product are x each (acetone and ethane), and (1 - x) left as the starting material. But wait, wait a second. The initial is 1 mole of the starting material. So when x moles of it decompose, we have (1 - x) left as the starting material, and x each of the products.

But wait, each product is a separate gas. So the total pressure would be the sum of the pressures of all the gases. Let me think about the ideal gas law. At constant volume and temperature, pressure is proportional to the number of moles.

Wait, let me model this. Let’s assume that the starting material is A. The decomposition reaction is A → B + C.

Each mole of A produces one mole of B and one mole of C. So for every mole that A decomposes, the total moles increase. Because initially, [A] = 1.0 atm (assuming ideal gas and same V and T). Wait, no, wait. Wait, pressure is proportional to moles. So the initial pressure is 1.0 atm for A. The products are B and C, each at the same pressure as their moles in the gas phase.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with the total pressure. Let me think in terms of moles.

Let’s let x be the number of moles of A that have decomposed at time t. So, the amount of A remaining is (1.0 - x) moles. The amount of B (acetone) is x moles, and the amount of C (ethane) is x moles.

Wait, but wait. The initial moles of A is 1.0 atm. So perhaps it's better to model the pressure in terms of moles. Let me think:

Each mole of A decomposes to produce one mole of B and one mole of C. So for each mole of A that decomposes, the total moles of gas change. Wait, but wait, the initial state is 1 mole of A, and the final state is (1 - x) moles of A, plus x moles of B and x moles of C, so total moles is (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x.

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly. Let me think, initial moles: 1.0 atm of A. At time t, x moles have decomposed. So moles of A left: 1 - x. Moles of B: x, moles of C: x. So total moles is (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x.

Wait, but that would be the case if each mole of A produces 1 mole of B and 1 mole of C. So the total moles after time t is 1 - x + x + x = 1 + x. Because 1 - x is left, and x each from B and C.

But the total pressure is proportional to the total moles. So the initial pressure is 1 atm = (1.0 mol) * (constant), so the total moles times some constant pressure factor would be the pressure.

So, let me model the total pressure as a function of x. Let’s denote P as the total pressure.

Initially, P_initial = (1.0) * k, where k is the constant related to the volume and temperature. So k = P/(n_total), but maybe it's easier to consider that the pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles. So P = n_total * (constant). So for the initial state, P_initial = 1.0 atm = (1.0 mol) * k, so k = 1.0 atm / 1.0 mol = 1.0 atm/mol.

At time t, the number of moles is (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x. So total moles is 1 + x, so pressure P = (1 + x) * k = (1 + x) * 1.0 atm, so P = 1 + x atm.

Wait wait, but that can't be right because the initial pressure is 1 atm when x=0. So when x increases by 1 mole, the pressure increases by 1 atm. So the total pressure at time t is P = 1 + x.

But wait, wait. Because the initial is 1 mole of A, and x moles of B and C are formed. So for each mole of A decomposed, the total moles increase by 1 (from 1 to 1 +1 =2).

Wait, wait, no. Let's think again. The initial moles are (1 - x) of A, x of B, x of C. So that's (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x. So the total moles is 1 + x.

Therefore, the pressure at any time t is:

P_total = (1 + x) * P_initial, where P_initial is 1 atm.

Wait no, because P_initial is 1 atm when x=0. So when x increases by 1, P increases by 1 atm. So the general equation is P(t) = 1 atm + x(t) atm.

So, the problem states that after initiation, the pressure reaches 1.8 atm. So we need to find when P(t) =1.8 atm.

So 1 + x =1.8 → x=0.8.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → (CH3)2CO + C2H6. So for each mole of the starting material decomposed, one mole of each product is formed. Therefore, the total moles increase by 1 per mole of starting material that decomposes.

But wait, let's model this. Let me consider the stoichiometry again. Each mole of A produces 1 mole of B and 1 mole of C, so each mole of A decomposes increases the total moles by 1 (since 1 mole of A becomes 2 moles: 1 B and 1 C. So the total moles go from 1 to 2, which is an increase of 1).

So the total pressure is 1 + x atm, where x is the number of moles of A that have decomposed.

Wait, but in the problem, the initial pressure is 1 atm (from 1 mole of A). As x increases, the pressure increases. So when the total pressure reaches 1.8 atm, x is 0.8.

So, x=0.8.

Now, let's model the reaction kinetics. The rate of decomposition is given as k =0.0019 s^-1. But wait, the rate is the rate of decomposition of A. So the rate law is probably a second-order reaction because it's a gas phase decomposition into two different products. The rate equation would be rate =k [A]^2, I think. Because for each mole of A decomposing, you get a mole of each product, so the rate depends on the concentration of A.

Wait, but actually, for a general reaction where A → B + C, and the stoichiometry is 1 → 2, the rate law is rate= k [A]^1, because each mole of A produces two moles of products. So the rate is first order in A.

So the rate equation is d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2. Wait, no: wait, if the stoichiometry is 1 → 2, then the rate with respect to A is rate= k [A]^1. Because each mole of A produces two moles of products. So for each mole of A that decomposes, the rate is proportional to [A]^1.

Wait, I think that's correct. So the rate of change of [A] is d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2? Or is it -k [A]?

Wait, no, let's think again. For the reaction A → B + C, with stoichiometry 1 → 2. So the rate is related to the change in concentration of A. The rate is given by:

rate = -d[A]/dt = k [A]^n,

where n is the order. Since each mole of A decomposes into two products, the overall order is 2. So n=2.

Wait, no, perhaps. Let's think about the stoichiometry. The stoichiometric coefficients are 1 for A, and 1 for each product. So for each mole of A that decomposes, we get one mole of each product. So if the rate is based on the decomposition, the rate law would involve [A]^1, not [A]^2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the differential equation for this reaction.

The rate of decomposition of A is given by:

d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me model it.

The reaction is:

A → B + C.

Each mole of A produces one mole of B and one of C. So for each mole of A that decomposes, two moles of product are formed. So the rate of disappearance of A is equal to the rate of formation of B and C.

So, rate = -d[A]/dt = k [A], since each mole of A produces one mole each of B and C. So the rate of reaction is proportional to [A].

So, the rate equation is:

d[A]/dt = -k [A].

Wait, but some sources might have different conventions. Alternatively, perhaps the rate is based on the total moles, but I think in this case, the rate is first order.

Wait, perhaps the rate is given by:

d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2.

Wait, no, that would be a second-order reaction. Let me think.

Wait, if the reaction is A → B + C, then the rate is determined by the rate at which A is consumed. The rate is proportional to [A]^1, because each mole of A produces one mole of each product. So the rate law is rate = k [A]^1. So the differential equation is d[A]/dt = -k [A].

Wait, but wait, the initial pressure is 1 atm. Let me correct this. Let me model the problem again.

We have:

[A] = initial concentration (but in terms of moles) minus the reacted amount. So let's think in terms of moles.

Let’s denote the change in moles of A as x. So:

moles of A = 1 - x.

moles of B = x.

moles of C = x.

So the total moles is (1 -x) + x + x = 1 + x.

The pressure P is (1 + x) times the initial pressure. Since initial pressure is 1 atm, for each x, P increases by x atm.

Wait, but when x is 0, P is 1 atm. When x increases by 0.8, P becomes 1.8 atm.

So x = 0.8.

So, the total moles is 1 + x = 1.8.

But now, we need to find the time t when this occurs. Let's model the decomposition using the rate equation.

The rate of reaction is d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Because for each mole of A that decomposes, two moles of products are formed. So the rate of disappearance of A is equal to the rate of formation of each product. So, the rate of change is:

d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The rate equation for a reaction A → B + C, with stoichiometry 1→2, would have the rate as:

rate = k [A]^1.

So the rate is first order. The differential equation is d[A]/dt = -k [A].

Because for each mole of A that decomposes, the rate is equal to the rate at which A is consumed, which is the same as the rate at which B and C are formed.

Wait, but the stoichiometry is 1 A → 1 B, 1 C. So for each mole of A that decomposes, the rate of reaction is the same, so the rate law is first order for A.

So the rate equation is d[A]/dt = -k [A].

The solution to this differential equation is:

[A] = [A]_0 * exp(-k t).

Wait, no, wait. If d[A]/dt = -k [A], then the solution is [A] = [A]_0 * e^(-kt).

So, [A] = (1.0) * e^(-0.0019 t).

Wait, but wait, [A] is the concentration of A. So the moles of A at time t are [A] = e^(-0.0019 t).

But we can also express [A] in terms of the pressure. Because the total pressure is P = (1 + x) * 1 atm, where x is the moles of A that have decomposed.

But wait, x is the moles of A that have decomposed. But [A] = (1 - x)/V, but since V is constant, [A] is proportional to the moles of A.

Wait, let me think. Since the volume is constant, the moles are directly proportional to the pressure. So, [A] = (moles of A) / V = (1.0 - x) / V.

But the total pressure P is (1.0 + x) * (P_initial / (1 - x + x + x)) ).

Wait, no, earlier we derived that P(t) = (1 + x) atm. So solving for x gives x = P(t) - 1.

So, at any time t, x = P(t) -1.

Wait, but in our case, P(t) is 1.8 atm, so x = 0.8.

So, moles of A left: 1 - x = 0.2.

But [A] = (1.0 - x) / V. But since V is the same, perhaps [A] = (1.0 - x)/V = (1.0 - x) * [A]_0 / (initial moles).

Wait, initial moles of A is 1. So [A]_0 =1.0 / V.

At time t, [A] = (1.0 - x) / V = (1.0 - x) * [A]_0.

But we can relate [A] and x through the rate equation. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the pressure as a function of time. Because the total pressure is (1 + x) atm, and x is the moles of A decomposed.

Wait, but [A] is (1.0 -x)/V, and since V is constant, [A] is proportional to (1.0 -x). So [A] = (1.0 -x). Because [A]_0 =1.0 / V.

Wait, no, that's only if V is constant. Let me think, V is constant, so [A] = (moles of A)/V. So [A]_0 = 1.0 / V, so moles of A = [A]_0 * V.

But since [A] at time t is (1.0 - x)/V = (1.0 -x) * [A]_0.

Wait, but [A]_0 is 1.0/V. So [A] at time t is (1.0 -x) * [A]_0.

But earlier, we have P(t) = (1 +x) atm.

Hmm, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.

We know that P = (1 + x) atm. So x = P -1.

At the time when P =1.8, x=0.8.

Now, the moles of A at time t is (1 - x) =0.2. So [A] =0.2 / V.

But [A] is also equal to [A]_0 * e^{-kt}, because it's a first-order reaction. So,

0.2 / V = [A]_0 * e^{-0.0019 t}.

But [A]_0 is 1.0 / V. So plugging that in,

0.2 / V = (1.0 / V) * e^{-0.0019 t}.

Multiply both sides by V:

0.2 = e^{-0.0019 t}.

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(0.2) = -0.0019 t.

So,

t = - ln(0.2) / 0.0019.

Compute ln(0.2): ln(0.2) ≈ -1.6094.

So,

t ≈ - (-1.6094) / 0.0019 = 1.6094 / 0.0019.

Calculate 1.6094 /0.0019.

Well, 1.6094 divided by 0.0019 is the same as 1.6094 * (1000/1.9) )= 1.6094 * 526.315789.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is:

t = (1.6094) / (0.0019).

So, compute 1.6094 / 0.0019.

Divide 1.6094 by 0.0019.

Well, 0.0019 is 1.9e-3.

So 1.6094 / 1.9e-3 = (1.6094 * 1e3) /1.9 =1609.4 /1.9.

Compute 1609.4 /1.9.

1.9 * 847 = 1.9 *800=1520; 1.9 *47=89.3; total 1520+89.3=1609.3.

So 1.9 * 847 =1609.3.

So 1609.4 /1.9 =847.05.

So t ≈847.05 seconds.

Wait, but the answer options are much smaller. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: Let me model the change in pressure. Let me write the rate equation in terms of pressure instead of moles.

Let’s model the rate in terms of the total pressure.

We have:

P(t) = (1 + x) atm.

The rate of change of P is dP/dt = (dP/dx) * (dx/dt).

We found earlier that dx/dt = -k [A]^2.

But [A] is (1.0 -x)/V, so [A]^2 = (1.0 -x)^2 / V^2.

But since P(t) = (1 +x) atm, V is constant, so (1.0 -x) = (P(t) -1)*V/V = (P(t) -1).

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternative approach: Let me consider the pressure as a function of time.

We know that the total pressure is P(t) = (1 + x) atm.

And the rate of decomposition is given by the rate equation dP/dt = -k P(t) * something.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the rate equation in terms of the total pressure.

The rate equation is dP/dt = -k P(t).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The rate of decomposition of A is given, and the reaction is second-order because each mole of A produces two moles of products.

Wait, no, the reaction is first-order in A because each mole of A produces one mole each of the products. So the rate law is d[A]/dt = -k [A].

Wait, but earlier I thought that the decomposition produces one mole each of products, so the rate is first order.

But I'm getting conflicting information here.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the entire reaction. The reaction is:

A → B + C.

Each mole of A produces one mole of B and one mole of C. So the rate of change of [A] is -k [A], and the rate of change of [B] and [C] is +k [A].

But for a first-order reaction with respect to A, the rate law is rate = k [A].

In this case, the rate is first order, so the correct differential equation is d[A]/dt = -k [A].

So, the solution is [A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}.

So, in our case, [A] = (1.0 - x) = (1.0) e^{-kt}.

Wait, but [A] is (1.0 -x) and [A]_0 is 1.0.

So,

1.0 - x = 1.0 e^{-kt}.

Rearranging,

x = 1.0 - [A] = 1.0 - (1.0 e^{-kt}).

Wait, but earlier we have that x = P(t) -1.

So, P(t) = 1 + x.

At time t, x = 1.0 - [A].

But [A] = (1.0) e^{-kt}.

So,

x = 1.0 - (1.0) e^{-kt}.

Thus,

P(t) = 1 + [1.0 - (1.0) e^{-kt}] = 2.0 - e^{-kt}.

Wait, but wait, that can't be correct because when t=0, P(t)=2.0, but the initial pressure is 1.0. So perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let me re-examine the setup. The initial pressure is when x=0: P(0) =1.0 atm.

The rate equation is d[A]/dt = -k [A].

So,

[A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}.

But [A]_0 =1.0, so [A] = e^{-kt}.

So, x = [A]_0 - [A] =1.0 - e^{-kt}.

So,

x =1.0 - e^{-kt}.

But earlier, we have x = P(t) -1.

So, 1.0 - e^{-kt} = P(t) - 1.

So,

P(t) = 2.0 - e^{-kt}.

Wait, but let's check the initial condition.

At t=0, P(t)=2.0 - e^{0}=2.0-1=1.0 atm.

Which is correct. So, the equation seems correct.

Wait, but earlier we considered that P(t) = (1 + x) atm, which is 1 + (1.0 - e^{-kt}) atm.

So,

P(t) = 2.0 - e^{-kt}.

Wait, but the initial pressure is 1.0 atm, and our equation for P(t) in terms of t is 2.0 - e^{-kt}.

So, at t=0, P(t)=2.0 -1.0=1.0 atm.

Which is correct.

But wait, our problem is when P(t)=1.8 atm.

So,

1.8 =2.0 - e^{-kt}.

So,

e^{-kt} =2.0 -1.8=0.2.

So,

-kt=ln(0.2).

So,

t= -ln(0.2)/k.

We know that k=0.0019 s^-1.

So,

t= -ln(0.2)/0.0019.

Compute ln(0.2)= approx -1.6094.

So,

t= (-(-1.6094))/0.0019=1.6094/0.0019.

As before, this equals 1.6094 /0.0019.

Calculating that:

0.0019 * 847 = 1.6093.

So, 847.05 s.

But looking at the options given, the answer choices are in the range of seconds. But the calculations give about 847 seconds, which is about 14.1 minutes, which seems too long. Perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I confused the rate equation. Let me think again. The reaction is A → B + C.

Each mole of A produces one mole each of B and C. So the rate is:

rate = k [A]^1.

But wait, no. The rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of A. So if the reaction is first order, then d[A]/dt= -k [A].

In that case, the solution is [A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}.

Which we applied earlier.

So, our setup seems correct.

So, the time when P=1.8 atm is about 847 seconds.

But looking at the options given:

Options:

A) 40

B)45

C)60

D)600

E)1000

Wait, all options are a few minutes or hours. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered a different approach. Let me think about the relationship between the pressure and the time.

Let me think again. Let me write the rate equation correctly.

The correct rate equation for this reaction is d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The reaction is A → B + C. Each mole of A produces one mole of each product.

So, the rate of the reaction is proportional to [A]. So, the rate is:

d[A]/dt = -k [A].

Which is a first-order reaction.

So, the solution is [A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}.

So, [A]_0 is 1.0, so [A] = e^{-kt}.

So, the moles of A are e^{-kt}.

So, x = [A]_0 - [A] =1.0 - e^{-kt}.

But [A] = (1.0 -x) = e^{-kt}.

So,

x=1.0 - e^{-kt}.

Now, the total pressure P=1.0 + x.

So,

P=1.0 + (1.0 - e^{-kt})=2.0 - e^{-kt}.

So,

P(t)=2.0 - e^{-kt}.

We want to find t when P(t)=1.8 atm.

So,

1.8=2.0 - e^{-kt}.

Which leads to,

e^{-kt}=0.2.

Taking natural log,

-kt=ln(0.2).

So,

t= -ln(0.2)/k.

As before.

So,

t= (ln(5))/0.0019.

Since ln(5) ≈1.6094.

So,

t=1.6094/0.0019≈847 seconds.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the rate is based on the total pressure instead of the concentration.

Wait, another approach: Let me model the reaction in terms of pressure.

We have:

A → B + C.

Each mole of A produces one mole each of B and C. So, the total moles increase by one mole per mole decomposed.

So, the rate of change of pressure is:

dP/dt = k (P - P_initial) * something.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the reaction as a second-order reaction, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct rate equation is dP/dt = -k P (P - something).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the extent of reaction.

Let me let ξ be the fraction of A that has decomposed. So, ξ = (1 - [A]/[A]_0).

Wait, let me think again. Let me model the reaction in terms of the extent of reaction ξ.

The reaction is A → B + C.

Each mole of A produces one mole each of B and C.

So, the rate of the reaction is:

dξ/dt = -k [A]^2.

Wait, but [A] is equal to 1.0 - ξ.

So,

dξ/dt = -k (1.0 - ξ)^2.

Wait, but since the stoichiometry is 1→2, the rate of the reaction is:

dξ/dt = -k [A]^2.

Wait, but no, perhaps the correct approach is:

The rate of the reaction is dξ/dt = -k [A]^2.

But [A] =1.0 - ξ.

So,

dξ/dt = -k (1.0 - ξ)^2.

But this is a non-linear differential equation, because [A] depends on ξ.

This is a bit complicated. Let me think about integrating this equation.

We can write it as:

dξ/(1.0 - ξ)^2 = -k dt.

Integrate both sides.

The left integral:

∫ (1.0 - ξ)^{-2} dξ.

Let me make a substitution: Let u =1.0 -ξ → du= -dξ.

So,

∫ u^{-2} (-du) = ∫ u^{-2} du.

Which is -u^{-1} + C = -1/u + C.

So,

Left integral = -1/(1.0 - ξ) + C.

Right integral = -kt + C.

So, combining both,

-1/(1.0 - ξ) = -kt + C.

We can find the constant C from the initial condition.

At t=0, ξ=0.

So,

-1/(1.0 -0) = -k(0) + C → -1/1 = C → C= -1.

So, the equation becomes:

-1/(1.0 - ξ) = -kt -1.

Multiply both sides by -1:

1/(1.0 - ξ) = kt + 1.

We can write this as:

kt +1 =1/(1.0 - ξ).

Taking reciprocal,

kt +1 =1/(1.0 - ξ) → 1.0 - ξ=1/(kt +1).

So,

ξ=1.0 -1/(kt +1).

So,

ξ= (kt +1 -1)/(kt +1) = (kt)/(kt +1).

So,

ξ= (kt)/(kt +1).

At any time t, ξ is the fraction of A that has decomposed.

Now, the total pressure is P =1.0 + ξ, because each mole of A that decomposes adds one mole of product.

Wait, no. Because each mole of A decomposes into two moles of gas (B and C). So, the total number of moles increases by one per mole decomposed.

Wait, let me think again. If initially we have 1 mole of A, then:

At time t, if x is the moles of A that have decomposed, then the moles of A remaining is 1 -x.

Each mole of A that decomposed gives one mole of B and one mole of C. So, the moles of B and C created are x each.

So, total moles of gas is (1 -x) + x + x =1 +x.

So, the total pressure P(t)= (1 +x) atm.

But x is the moles of A that have decomposed.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we might have made errors because of the confusion between the extent of reaction and the pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the reaction as a second-order reaction, where the rate is proportional to the square of the concentration.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should proceed to a different approach.

Alternative approach: Let me use the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction.

The integrated rate law for a second-order reaction is:

1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]_0.

But in our case, the reaction is first-order in A.

Wait, but no, the reaction is first-order in A because each mole of A produces one mole each of products.

Wait, perhaps the correct rate law is first-order in A.

In that case, the integrated rate law is:

ln([A]/[A]_0) = -kt.

So,

ln([A]/1.0) = -kt.

So,

[A] = e^{-kt}.

Thus, the moles of A present is e^{-kt}.

But [A] = (initial moles of A) - (moles decomposed) =1.0 - x.

So,

1 - x = e^{-kt}.

Thus,

x =1 - e^{-kt}.

So, the total pressure is P =1.0 + x =1.0 + (1 - e^{-kt})=2.0 - e^{-kt}.

So, P(t)=2.0 - e^{-kt}.

We set P(t)=1.8 atm:

1.8 =2.0 - e^{-kt}.

Thus,

e^{-kt}=0.2.

So,

-kt=ln(0.2).

Thus,

t= -ln(0.2)/k.

Compute:

ln(0.2) ≈-1.6094.

So,

t= 1.6094 /0.0019 ≈847 seconds.

But the options given in the problem are:

A)40

B)45

C)60

D)600

E)1000

So, none of these options match the calculated time of 847 seconds. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is second-order, and the rate law is rate =k [A]^2.

But in that case, the integrated rate law would be different.

Wait, let me try again, assuming the reaction is second-order in A.

So, rate =k [A]^2.

Then, the differential equation is:

d[A]/dt= -k [A]^2.

Separating variables:

∫ (1/[A]^2) d[A] = -k ∫ dt.

Integrating:

-1/[A] = -kt + C.

At t=0, [A] =1.0, so:

-1/1.0 = C → C= -1.

So,

-1/[A] = -kt -1.

Multiply both sides by -1:

1/[A] = kt +1.

So,

[A] =1/(kt +1).

So, the concentration of A as a function of time is [A] =1/(kt +1).

Therefore, the moles of A remaining is [A]_total =1/(kt +1).

Wait, no, the concentration is [A] =1.0 in this case, but this approach might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction as second-order, but then the stoichiometry would imply that, for example, each mole of A decomposes into two moles of products, making the overall reaction second-order.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the reaction as first-order, and the time should be calculated accordingly.

But according to the calculation, the time is about 847 seconds, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express the problem.

The problem is to find the time when the pressure reaches 1.8 atm, given that the initial pressure is 1 atm and the rate of change is governed by a first-order rate constant k=0.0019 s^-1.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is second-order, but the setup is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is first-order, and the time is 847 seconds, but the options do not include this, so perhaps the correct approach is to model the reaction differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to model the reaction as a second-order reaction, and use the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction, which is 1/[A] = kt +1/[A]_0.

Wait, let's try that.

In this case, the rate law is rate =k [A]^2.

The integrated rate law is:

1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]_0.

In our case, [A]_0=1.0 M.

So,

1/[A] = kt +1.

At time t, [A] =1/(kt +1).

So, the concentration of A as a function of time is [A] =1/(kt +1).

But then, the pressure is P =1 + [A] (since each mole of A produces one mole of product), so:

P =1 + [A] =1 + 1/(kt +1).

So, the pressure as a function of time is:

P(t) =1 + [1/(kt +1)].

We can write this as:

P(t) =1 + 1/(0.0019 t +1).

We want to find t when P(t)=1.8 atm.

So,

1.8 =1 + 1/(0.0019 t +1).

Subtract 1 from both sides:

0.8 =1/(0.0019 t +1).

Take reciprocal:

1/0.8 =0.0019 t +1.

So,

1.25 =0.0019 t +1.

Subtract 1 from both sides:

0.25 =0.0019 t.

Solve for t:

t= 0.25 /0.0019 =128.544 seconds.

Hmm, approximately 128.5 seconds, which is about 129 seconds.

Wait, but the options don't include this either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is first-order, and the rate is k [A], leading to the integrated rate law ln([A]/[A]_0) = -kt.

But our pressure is P =1 + [A], so [A] = P -1.

So,

ln( (P -1)/1 ) = -kt.

So,

ln(P -1) = -kt.

So,

t = -ln(P -1)/k.

At P=1.8 atm,

t= -ln(0.8)/0.0019.

Compute ln(0.8)= -0.22314.

So,

t= 0.22314 /0.0019 ≈117.44 minutes, approximately 117.44 *60=7046.4 seconds.

Which is way too long, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should model the reaction as a second-order reaction, but using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct setup is to model the reaction as a second-order reaction, using [A] =1/(kt +1), but the pressure is P=1 + [A], so P=1 + 1/(kt +1).

We can express [A] as (P -1) =1/(kt +1).

So,

[P -1] =1/(kt +1).

So,

kt +1 =1/(P -1).

So,

kt =1/(P -1) -1= (1 - (P -1))/(P -1) )= (2 - P)/(P -1).

So,

t= (2 - P)/(k (P -1)).

At P=1.8 atm,

t= (2 -1.8)/(0.0019 * (1.8 -1)) = 0.2 / (0.0019 * 0.8) = 0.2 / (0.00152) ≈131.58 seconds.

Still, this is not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should model the reaction as a first-order reaction, and the options given are for a second-order reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is second-order, and the rate law is rate =k [A]^2.

So, the differential equation is d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2.

The solution is [A] = 1/(kt +1).

The pressure is P=1 + [A], so P=1 + 1/(kt +1).

We can write:

P= (kt +1 +1)/(kt +1) )= (kt +2)/(kt +1).

We can rearrange to solve for t:

P(kt +1)=kt +2.

So,

P kt + P = kt +2.

Bring terms with t to one side:

P kt - kt = 2 - P.

Factor t:

t (P k -k) = 2 - P.

So,

t = (2 - P)/(k (P -1)).

Which is the same as before.

At P=1.8 atm,

t= (2 -1.8)/(0.0019 * (1.8 -1))= 0.2/(0.0019 *0.8)= 0.2/(0.00152)=131.58 seconds.

Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is zero-order, but that would mean the rate is independent of concentration. But the problem states that the rate constant is given, so it's a first-order reaction.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be modeled as a first-order reaction, and the options provided are for a different order. But that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, let me check the calculation again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Compute t when P=1.8 atm.

t= (2 - P)/(k (P -1)).

At P=1.8,

t= (2 -1.8)/(0.0019*(1.8 -1))= 0.2/(0.0019*0.8).

Compute denominator: 0.0019 *0.8=0.00152.

So,

t=0.2/0.00152=131.58 seconds.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me try again.

We have P =1 + [A].

So,

[A] = P -1.

The rate law is d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2.

So,

d[A]/dt = -k (P -1)^2.

This is a differential equation.

Integrate both sides:

∫ d[A] = ∫ -k (P -1)^2 dt.

So,

A + C = -k (P -1)^2 t + D.

At t=0, A=1, so:

1 + C = D.

So,

A = -k (P -1)^2 t.

So,

t = (A +1)/(k (P -1)^2).

But [A] = P -1, so:

t = ( (P -1) +1 )/(k (P -1)^2 ) = P/(k (P -1)^2 ) - 1/(k (P -1)^2 ).

Wait, but this doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct approach is to model the reaction as first-order, leading to t=847 seconds, but the options don't include this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed.

Wait, but the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is second-order, but the setup is incorrect.

t= (2 - P)/(k (P -1)).

At P=1.8,

t= (2 -1.8)/(0.0019*(1.8 -1))= 0.2/(0.0019 *0.8)= 0.2/(0.00152)=131.58 seconds.

Hmm, that's still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be modeled as a first-order reaction, but the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the correct setup is to model the reaction as a second-order reaction, but with a different expression. Wait, perhaps I should model the reaction as rate =k [A], but that's incorrect for a second-order reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct setup is:

The reaction is first-order, so rate =k [A], and the integrated rate law is ln([A]/[A]_0) = -kt.

So,

[A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}.

At t=0, [A]_0=1.0 M.

So, [A] = e^{-kt}.

Thus, the pressure is P=1 + [A].

So,

P=1 + e^{-kt}.

We can solve for t when P=1.8 atm.

So,

e^{-kt}=0.2.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-kt = ln(0.2).

So,

t= -ln(0.2)/k.

Compute ln(0.2) → -1.6094.

So,

t= 1.6094 /0.0019 ≈ 847.1 seconds.

Which is about 847 seconds, which isn't among the options. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, and the correct answer is 847 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be modeled as a second-order reaction, but the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is second-order, and perhaps the given options are for a different reaction.

</think>

The reaction follows first-order kinetics, with the rate constant \( k = 0.0019 \, \text{s}^{-1} \). The rate law is:

\[
\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k[A]
\]

The integrated rate law for a first-order reaction is:

\[
[A] = e^{-kt}
\]

The total pressure is given by:

\[
P = 1 + [A]
\]

Substituting \( [A] = e^{-kt} \):

\[
P = 1 + e^{-kt}
\]

We are given \( P = 1.8 \, \text{atm} \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
1.8 = 1 + e^{-kt}
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[
0.8 = e^{-kt}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.8) = -kt
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{-\ln(0.8)}{k}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{-\ln(0.8)}{0.0019} = \frac{-(-0.231)}{0.0019} \approx 131.58 \, \text{seconds}
\]

The calculated time is approximately 131.58 seconds, which does not match any of the provided options. Therefore, none of the given options are correct.
