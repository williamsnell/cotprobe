Okay, so I've got this problem here about a publisher's breakeven point. Hmm, breakeven point... I remember it's the point where the publisher's total revenue equals total costs. At that point, he's neither making a profit nor a loss. 

The problem says fixed daily costs are $300. So that's the cost that doesn't change no matter how many books are sold. Then, each book sells for $1.00. His cost per book is 75 cents. So, the variable cost per book is 75 cents. 

Wait, so the variable cost is per unit. So for each book sold, the publisher has to subtract 75 cents from the revenue to cover his variable costs. The fixed cost is a one-time expense, regardless of how many books he sells. 

So the breakeven point is when Total Revenue = Total Costs. Let me think about how to calculate that. 

Total Revenue (TR) is the number of books sold multiplied by the selling price per book. So TR = Q * $1.00.

Total Costs (TC) are fixed costs plus variable costs. Fixed is $300, variable is 75 cents per book, so TC = $300 + (0.75 * Q).

At breakeven, TR = TC, so:

Q * 1.00 = 300 + 0.75 Q.

Let me solve that equation. Subtract 0.75 Q from both sides:

Q - 0.75 Q = 300.

That's 0.25 Q = 300.

So Q = 300 / 0.25 = 1200 books.

Wait, so the breakeven point is 1,200 books. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option A is 1,200 books. Option B is 2,200. So I think A is the correct answer. 

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check. Let me calculate total revenue and costs at 1,200 books. 

TR = 1,200 * $1 = $1,200.

Variable cost = 1,200 * $0.75 = $900.

Total cost = $300 fixed + $900 variable = $1,200. So yes, that matches. 

So the breakeven point is at 1,200 books. The correct answer should be option A.

The breakeven point is calculated when total revenue equals total costs. For this publisher:

- Fixed costs = $300.
- Variable cost per book = $0.75.
- Selling price per book = $1.00.

Setting up the equation: \( Q \times 1.00 = 300 + 0.75Q \).

Solving for \( Q \):
\[
Q - 0.75Q = 300 \\
0.25Q = 300 \\
Q = 1,200 \text{ books}.
\]

The breakeven point is at **1,200 books**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
