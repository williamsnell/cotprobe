Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm. The question is about the work done by a couple rotating a shaft. 

Wait, what's a couple again? Oh right, a couple is a pair of forces with equal magnitude but opposite directions, and they don't intersect, so they produce torque but no net force. The moment of the couple is given as M = theta squared plus 2 theta, where theta is in radians. 

The problem says the couple rotates the shaft by 60 degrees. I need to find the work done. Oh, right, work done by a torque is the integral of torque with respect to angle, right? Because torque is force times radius, and work is force times distance. So when you rotate the shaft by an angle, the work done is the torque multiplied by the angle, but wait, torque is in lb-ft and angle in radians. So the units should work out.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The work done by a torque when rotating an angle is actually the integral of torque times d(theta). But torque is a constant here because it's given as M(theta) = theta² + 2 theta. So the integral would be M(theta) d(theta). Oh right, because torque is constant in this case, so the work done would be M multiplied by the angle rotated in radians. Because when you integrate torque (a constant) over angle, it's just torque times angle in radians.

Wait, but wait, theta is in radians. So if I have the angle in degrees, I need to convert it to radians before multiplying. Oh, but the given rotation is 60 degrees. So 60 degrees is pi/3 radians, approximately 1.0472 radians.

So let me think: the work done W is the integral of M d(theta) from theta_initial to theta_final. Since the torque is constant, the integral is just M * (theta_final - theta_initial). But in this case, what's the initial angle? Well, if the shaft starts at rest, theta_initial is zero. So W = M * theta.

Wait, but wait. M is given as a function of theta. Oh, and theta here is the angle in radians. So M = theta² + 2 theta. So when the shaft is rotated by 60 degrees, that's theta = 60°, which is pi/3 radians.

So I substitute theta = pi/3 into M, calculate that, and that's the work done.

Let me compute M(pi/3). 

M = (pi/3)^2 + 2*(pi/3)

Calculating each term:

(pi/3)^2 is (pi²)/9. 2*(pi/3) is 2 pi /3.

So M = (pi²)/9 + (2 pi)/3.

I need to calculate this numerically.

Compute each part:

pi is approximately 3.1416.

(pi²) is about 9.8696. Divided by 9 gives about 1.0966.

2 pi is about 6.2832. Divided by 3 is 2.0944.

So adding those two: 1.0966 + 2.0944 = 3.1910 ft-lb.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is that the work done? Because torque is in lb-ft, and the angle is in radians, so W in ft-lb is correct.

Looking at the options, the values are A:1.68, B:1.55, C:1.58, D:1.48, E:1.28, F:1.50, G:1.75, H:1.38, I:1.20, J:2.00.

So the computed value is approximately 3.191, which isn't any of the options. Hmm, that's odd. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let's read again. The question says the couple rotates a shaft 60°, and the moment of the couple is M = theta² + 2 theta ft-lb, where theta is in radians. Oh wait, wait a minute, the moment is given as M(theta) = theta^2 + 2 theta. So M is given in lb-ft, and theta is in radians, so the work should be the integral of M d(theta) from 0 to 60 degrees.

So the integral of M(theta) d(theta) from 0 to 60 degrees. But M(theta) is in lb-ft, and integrating d(theta) is in radians, so the units are ft-lb.

So compute the work as the integral of M(theta) d theta, from 0 to pi/3 radians.

Wait, M(theta) is (theta^2 + 2 theta) ft-lb.

So the integral from 0 to pi/3 of (theta^2 + 2 theta) d theta.

The integral of theta^2 is (theta^3)/3, and the integral of 2 theta is theta^2. So evaluating from 0 to pi/3:

[( ( (pi/3)^3 ) / 3 + (pi/3)^2 ) ] - [0 + 0] 

= ( (pi^3)/(3^3 * 3) ) + (pi^2)/(3^2) )

Wait, let me compute the terms step by step.

(theta^3)/3 evaluated at pi/3:

(pi/3)^3 = pi³/(27). Divided by 3: pi³/(27*3) = pi³/(81).

(theta^2) evaluated at pi/3: (pi/3)^2 = pi²/9.

So the total integral is pi³/(81) + pi²/9.

Let me compute this numerically.

pi^3 is approximately (3.1416)^3. Let me compute:

3.1416^2 is ~9.8696. 3.1416 * 9.8696 ≈ 30.96 (exact: 3.1416*9.8696 ≈ 31.006). So pi^3 ≈ 31.006.

So pi³/(81) ≈ 31.006 / 81 ≈ 0.3826.

pi² is about 9.8696. So pi²/9 ≈ 9.8696/9 ≈ 1.0966.

Adding them together: 0.3826 + 1.0966 ≈ 1.4792 ft-lb.

So approximately 1.48 ft-lb.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1.48 ft-lb. But wait, wait. Wait, I thought the moment was given in ft-lb, but wait the problem says the moment of the couple is M = theta^2 + 2 theta ft-lb. So perhaps I was right the first time.

Alternatively, maybe M is in lb-ft, and the angle is in radians, so the work is M times theta.

Wait, no, because the integral of M d theta gives the work, which is in ft-lb. So earlier calculation gives about 1.48, which is option D. But the options don't have 1.48 as option D. Wait, the options are:

A: 1.68

B: 1.55

C: 1.58

D: 1.48

E: 1.28

F: 1.50

G: 1.75

H: 1.38

I: 1.20

J: 2.00

So D is 1.48, which matches our calculation. But wait, in the initial approach, I thought the work was M multiplied by theta in radians. But when I computed the integral, I got approximately 1.48, which is option D.

So why does the question say the moment is M(theta) = theta^2 + 2 theta, and when the shaft is rotated 60 degrees, the work done is? So, using the integral approach, the answer is approximately 1.48, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the integral calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Integral of (theta^2 + 2 theta) d theta from 0 to pi/3.

Integral of theta^2 is (theta^3)/3. Evaluated from 0 to pi/3: (pi^3)/(3 * 3^3) = (pi^3)/(81) as before.

Integral of 2 theta is theta^2. Evaluated from 0 to pi/3: (pi/3)^2 = pi²/9.

So total integral is pi³/(81) + pi²/9.

Plugging in pi=3.1416:

pi^3 ≈ 31.006.

pi^3/81 ≈ 31.006 /81 ≈ 0.3826.

pi² ≈ 9.8696.

pi²/9 ≈ 1.0966.

Adding together: 0.3826 +1.0966 = 1.4792, which is approximately 1.48 ft-lb.

So the answer would be option D. But wait looking at the options, the options are:

A:1.68

B:1.55

C:1.58

D:1.48

E:1.28

F:1.50

G:1.75

H:1.38

I:1.20

J:2.00

So the correct answer is D:1.48.

The problem involves calculating the work done by a couple rotating a shaft, where the moment of the couple is given as \( M = \theta^2 + 2\theta \) ft-lb, with \( \theta \) in radians. The shaft is rotated by 60°, which is equivalent to \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \) radians.

The work done is calculated as the integral of the torque with respect to angle:

\[
W = \int_0^{\pi/3} M(\theta) \, d\theta = \int_0^{\pi/3} (\theta^2 + 2\theta) \, d\theta
\]

Breaking this into two terms:

1. **Integral of \( \theta^2 \):**
   \[
   \int \theta^2 \, d\theta = \frac{\theta^3}{3}
   \]

2. **Integral of \( 2\theta \):**
   \[
   \int 2\theta \, d\theta = \theta^2
   \]

Evaluating these from 0 to \( \pi/3 \):

\[
W = \left[ \frac{\theta^3}{3} + \theta^2 \right]_0^{\pi/3}
\]

At \( \theta = \pi/3 \):
\[
\frac{(\pi/3)^3}{3} + (\pi/3)^2 = \frac{\pi^3}{81} + \frac{\pi^2}{9}
\]

At \( \theta = 0 \), both terms are zero. Thus:
\[
W = \frac{\pi^3}{81} + \frac{\pi^2}{9}
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
- \( \pi^3 \approx 31.006 \), so \( \frac{\pi^3}{81} \approx 0.3826 \)
- \( \pi^2 \approx 9.8696 \), so \( \frac{\pi^2}{9} \approx 1.0966 \)

Adding these:
\[
W \approx 0.3826 + 1.0966 = 1.4792 \, \text{ft-lb}
\]

This value is closest to option **D: 1.48 ft-lb**.
