Okay, I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to partial derivatives and equations of state. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the question gives me an equation of state: P(V - nb) = nRT. Hmm, wait, I think that's the van der Waals equation. Oh right, because it's the form P(V - nb) = nRT. So b is the volume per mole, and n is the number of moles. I remember that for gases, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But this one accounts for the excluded volume, so it's more like real gas behavior.

The problem now asks me to find the partial derivatives ∂V/∂T at constant pressure (T) and ∂V/∂P at constant temperature (T), and then express dV in terms of P, T, (V - nb), dT, and dP.

Alright, let's tackle ∂V/∂T at constant P first. I'll treat P as a constant when taking the partial derivative with respect to T.

Starting with the equation:
P(V - nb) = nRT.

Let me rearrange this to express V in terms of T and other variables. So, V - nb = (nRT)/P. Therefore, V = (nRT)/P + nb.

Now, I can take the partial derivative of V with respect to T at constant P. So, for V = (nR/P) T + nb, the derivative of (nR/P)T with respect to T is (nR/P), because nb is a constant for this partial derivative. So ∂V/∂T at constant P is (nR)/(P).

Wait, but the question asks for ∂V/∂T in terms of (V - nb), T, etc. Let me think. Because in the expression for dV, we'll have terms involving (V - nb), which equals (nRT)/P from the original equation.

Wait, from P(V - nb) = nRT, so V - nb = (nRT)/P. So, let me substitute that into the expression for ∂V/∂T. So ∂V/∂T = (nR)/P. But I want to express this in terms of (V - nb), which is (nRT)/P. So, (nRT)/P is equal to V - nb. So, substituting that in, ∂V/∂T = (nR)/(P) = (V - nb)/(T) * (something? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no, because (V - nb) = nRT/P. So nR/P = (V - nb)/T. Oh right, because (nRT)/P = V - nb → nR/P = (V - nb)/T. So ∂V/∂T = nR/P = (V - nb)/T.

Wait, but wait, the partial derivative I found earlier is (nR)/(P), and (V - nb) is equal to nRT/P. So substituting, nR/P = (V - nb) / T. Because (nRT)/P = V - nb → dividing both sides by T, we get nR/P = (V - nb)/T. So ∂V/∂T is (V - nb)/T.

Wait, but wait a second. The derivative I found was (nR)/P, which I can write as (V - nb)/T. Let me check the units to be sure. nR has units of (mol)(J/(mol·K)), and P is in Pascals, so (nR)/P would have units (J/(mol·K)) / (Pa) → but since 1 Pa = 1 N/m² and 1 J = 1 N·m, so units would be (N·m/(mol·K)) / (N/m²) → m³/(mol·K). Hmm, but the units for (V - nb) are m³ per mole. So (V - nb)/T would have units (m³/mol)/K. So that's the same as (nR)/P. So correct.

So, ∂V/∂T at constant P is (V - nb)/T.

Now, for the other partial derivative: ∂V/∂P at constant T. Let's go through the same steps.

The original equation: P(V - nb) = nRT.

Take partial derivative with respect to P at constant T. So, d/dP (V - nb) * P = nRT. The derivative of (V - nb) with respect to P is dV/dP. Since nb is a constant for this partial derivative, the equation becomes:

dV/dP * P = nRT → dV/dP = (nRT)/P.

But from the original equation, P(V - nb) = nRT → (nRT)/P = V - nb. So substituting into the derivative, dV/dP = (V - nb).

Wait, but wait, let's double-check that. So, the original equation is P(V - nb) = nRT.

So, d/dP of left side: (dV/dP) * P + (d/dP)V * nb. But since nb is a constant, the derivative of nb with respect to P is zero. So, (dV/dP) * P = nRT.

Divide both sides by P: dV/dP = (nRT)/P.

But from the original equation, (nRT) is P(V - nb). So substituting that, dV/dP = [P(V - nb)] / P → dV/dP = (V - nb).

Wait, that can't be right. Because (V - nb) is in terms of V, which is a function of P and T, but I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me recheck.

Wait, (nRT) equals P(V - nb), as given. So (nRT)/P = V - nb. So, substituting into dV/dP = (nRT)/P → dV/dP = V - nb.

Hmm, that's a bit unexpected. Let me think again. Wait, is that correct? Let me do it step by step.

Original equation: P(V - nb) = nRT.

Differentiate both sides with respect to P, treating V as a function of P and T.

Left side: d/dP [P(V - nb)] = (V - nb) + P * dV/dP (since nb is constant).

Right side: d/dP [nRT] = 0, because n, R, T are all considered constants in this differentiation.

So equation becomes:

(V - nb) + P (dV/dP) = 0 → P (dV/dP) = -(V - nb) → dV/dP = -(V - nb)/P.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. That's a crucial point. I must have made a mistake in substituting earlier.

So, wait, let's re-express the substitution. From the original equation, P(V - nb) = nRT → nRT = P(V - nb). So, substituting into dV/dP:

dV/dP = (nRT)/P → (P(V - nb))/P → (V - nb).

Wait, that's the same as before. So if I have dV/dP = (V - nb), that contradicts the earlier differentiation, which gave me dV/dP = -(V - nb)/P.

Hmm, I must have made an error in the differentiation step.

Wait, let's go through the differentiation again. 

Original equation: P(V - nb) = nRT.

Differentiate both sides with respect to P, T held constant.

Left side: derivative is (dV/dP) * P + (V - nb) * dP/dP. Wait, no, dP/dP is 1, but wait: the function is P(V-Pb), so derivative is d/dP [ P (V - nb) ) ].

Which is (V - nb) + P * (dV/dP).

Wait, no, the product rule is (d/dP)(P) * (V - nb) + P * (d/dP)(V - nb). But since V is a function of P and T, and nb is a constant, so d/dP (V - nb) is dV/dP.

So the left side derivative is (1)(V - nb) + P (dV/dP).

The right side is d/dP [nRT], which is zero because n, R, T are all constants when P is the variable.

So equation becomes:

(V - nb) + P (dV/dP) = 0 → P (dV/dP) = -(V - nb) → dV/dP = -(V - nb)/P.

Ah, I see. So my initial substitution was wrong. The correct partial derivative is -(V - nb)/P.

So, I think I made a mistake earlier in the substitution. So, ∂V/∂P at constant T is -(V - nb)/P.

So summarizing:

∂V/∂T at constant P is (V - nb)/T.

∂V/∂P at constant T is -(V - nb)/P.

Now, the problem says to find dV in terms of other variables and differentials dT and dP.

So, using the total differential formula:

dV = (∂V/∂T)_P dT + (∂V/∂P)_T dP.

So I'll substitute each partial derivative.

So, dV = [(V - nb)/T] dT + [-(V - nb)/P] dP.

Which can be written as dV = (V - nb) [ (dT)/T - (dP)/P ].

Hmm, let me factor out (V - nb).

Alternatively, it can be written as dV = (V - nb)( (1/T) dT - (1/P) dP ) or (V - nb)( (dP/P - dT/T) ) but that's the same as [ (V - nb)/T dT - (V - nb)/P dP ].

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: dV= - [(V - nb)/P]dP - [(V - nb)/T]dT → So it's -(V-nb)/P dP and -(V-nb)/T dT. But according to our calculation, the signs are positive for (V-nb)/T dT and negative for (V-nb)/P dP. So this would mean dV = (V - nb)(dT/T - dP/P), which is positive dT and negative dP. But option A has both terms negative. So this can't be right.

Option B: dV= - [(V - nb)/P]dP + [(V - nb)/T]dT. So first term is negative, second positive. Our calculation has (V-nb)/T dT and -(V-nb)/P dP. So the expression matches option B's first term (negative), but our second term is positive. So option B is (V - nb)(-dP/P + dT/T) which is same as our expression. So the dV in option B is (V-nb)(-(dP/P) + (dT/T)) which is same as our expression.

But wait, looking again, our expression is dV= (V - nb)/T dT - (V - nb)/P dP. So it's positive dT and negative dP.

Option B says: - [(V - nb)/P]dP + [(V - nb)/T]dT → which is same as option B's terms but arranged differently. So option B is correct in the form.

But let me check the other options.

Option C: dV= [ (V-nb)/P ] dP - [ (V-nb)/T ] dT → so first term positive, second negative. But our expression has positive dT and negative dP, so option C has dT term negative, which is incorrect.

Option D: dV= [ (V-nb)/P ] dP + [ (V-nb)/T ] dP → which is wrong because the second term is positive, but our ∂V/∂P is negative.

Wait, no, the option D says: [ (V-nb)/P ] dP + [ (V-nb)/T ] dP → that would be (V-nb)/P + (V-nb)/T multiplied by dP, which is not correct because in our case, the second term is negative (dP term is with a negative coefficient). So option D's expression is incorrect because it's adding (V-nb)/T dP, but our expression is (V-nb)/T dT minus (V-nb)/P dP.

Wait, let me look again. The options say:

Option A: dV= - [(V-nb)/P] dP - [(V-nb)/T] dT → So both terms are negative.

But according to our calculation, the first term is positive (dP term is -), and the second term is positive (dT term). So option A's dV is - dP term and - dT term. So no, that's not matching.

So, option B: dV = - (dP/P) * (V - nb) + (dT/T) * (V - nb) → which is (V-nb) [ -dP/P + dT/T ] → which is our expression.

So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but I thought earlier that option B's expression is correct. So the correct answer is option B: dV = - [(V - nb)/P]dP + [(V - nb)/T]dT = (V - nb) [ -dP/P + dT/T ].

Wait, but let me check if there's any negative sign that might have been missed.

Wait, in the earlier differentiation, I got dV/dP = -(V - nb)/P.

So the expression for dV would have (dV/dP) dP as a negative term. So the entire dV has (dV/dP) dP plus (dV/dT) dT. So:

dV = (dV/dT)_P dT + (dV/dP)_T dP → which is (V - nb)/T dT - (V - nb)/P dP.

Which is the same as option B.

To solve the problem, we start with the given equation of state for a van der Waals gas: 

\[
P(V - nb) = nRT.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \((\partial V / \partial T)_P\)
Rearrange the equation to express \(V\) in terms of \(T\), \(P\), and \(n\):

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P} + nb.
\]

Taking the partial derivative of \(V\) with respect to \(T\) at constant \(P\):

\[
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P = \frac{nR}{P}.
\]

Using the relationship \(V - nb = \frac{nRT}{P}\), we substitute \(nR/P = \frac{V - nb}{T}\), giving:

\[
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P = \frac{V - nb}{T}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \((\partial V / \partial P)_T\)
Rearrange the original equation to express \(P\) in terms of \(V\), \(T\), and \(n\):

\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V - nb}.
\]

Taking the partial derivative of \(P\) with respect to \(P\) at constant \(T\):

\[
\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial P}\right)_T = 1.
\]

However, using the chain rule for partial derivatives, we find:

\[
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T = -\frac{V - nb}{P}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(dV\) in terms of \(P\), \(T\), \(V - nb\), \(dT\), and \(dP\)
Using the total differential formula:

\[
dV = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P dT + \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T dP.
\]

Substitute the partial derivatives:

\[
dV = \frac{V - nb}{T} dT - \frac{V - nb}{P} dP.
\]

Rewriting this:

\[
dV = (V - nb) \left(-\frac{dP}{P} + \frac{dT}{T}\right).
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The derived expression matches **Option B**:

\[
dV = -\frac{V - nb}{P} dP + \frac{V - nb}{T} dT = (V - nb) \left(-\frac{dP}{P} + \frac{dT}{T}\right).
\]
