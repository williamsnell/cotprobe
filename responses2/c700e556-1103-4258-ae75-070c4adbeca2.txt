Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient's insomnia and the appropriate management. Let me try to think through it step by step.

First, the patient is a 76-year-old man who's had a sleep issue. He wakes up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM every night. He's retired as a postal worker, which suggests he might have had a busy day working. He's physically active and has diabetes under his control, specifically controlled by diet. He drinks a cup of coffee in the morning with breakfast and usually walks in the morning. Before retiring, he had one drink. His wife is healthy too. 

Looking at his vital signs: temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), which is within normal range. Pulse is 96, which is normal. Respirations are 18/min, which is also normal. Blood pressure is 135/90, which is a bit elevated but seems okay. The physical exam shows a well-nourished, developed man. No signs of obesity, no major issues like bruits or jugular venous distension. The chest is clear, and the heart is normal with S1 and S2, which are normal. Abdomen is soft, so no issues there. Rectal examination is clear. 

So, the main issue is morning sleepiness. He's active, so maybe it's not something else like sleep apnea. He's been exercising, active, and has diabetes. He's a retired person, so perhaps he's not having sleep issues from other causes like lack of sleep apnea or something else.

Looking at the options:

A: Watch TV before bed. That's a common method, but not the first line of response. It’s more of a comfort measure.

B: Sleep pills. Sleep meds can help, but if the patient is responding well, maybe they’re not having a hard time sleeping. However, if they’re not responding, taking them might help.

C: Read and snack. That's a good idea because reading can relax the brain, and snacks can provide a healthy energy source.

D: Daytime nap. That's a real possibility. He might need to sleep longer than usual, especially if he's active and active sleep is a problem.

E: Exercise. He goes to bed and walks, so maybe the lack of sleep is related to him not getting enough movement. So maybe he needs to exercise more.

F: Sertraline. I'm not sure about this. Sertraline is a stimulant, but he's on a controlled diet and diabetes. Plus, he drinks coffee, so maybe it's not related to that.

G: Low-carb diet. He has diabetes, which is controlled by diet, but he's already on a high-carb diet. Maybe he's not going to switch to low-carb.

H: Increase caffeine. He's on coffee, which is a caffeine source. But his blood pressure is elevated. So maybe it's not because of caffeine.

I: Increase caffeine intake. That doesn't make much sense since he's already having high caffeine levels.

J: Increase caffeine. Again, not relevant.

Wait, the patient is 76, active, and has diabetes. So perhaps it's sleep apnea. If he's not having sleep apnea, then his sleep issues might be more related to other factors. But he's been exercising, so maybe it's not sleep apnea. However, he might not have it. Alternatively, maybe he's just not getting enough rest.

Another angle: he's a retired person, so perhaps he's not getting enough sleep because he's busy. But he's active, so maybe he's adequate. But his blood pressure is a concern. His blood pressure is 135/90. That’s a bit high. So maybe he needs a day nap or some other support.

So the options C and D are both about managing the sleep. C is about relaxation and snacking, D about getting a longer nap.

But options F and G are about medications. Maybe he needs another medication. But the patient is on a controlled diet, so perhaps not. F and G don't seem directly related.

The patient's main issue is sleep, so the management would be either to increase sleep, or alleviate it. Since he's active, maybe he's not getting enough sleep because he's engaged in activities that interfere. So, he's not getting enough rest, but why?

Alternatively, maybe he's not having adequate sleep because he's not getting enough movement, which could be related to his activity level. For someone who's active, sleep apnea might be a problem, but he might not have it. Or, maybe he's just not getting enough rest because he's not being encouraged to sleep.

Other factors: Maybe his caffeine intake is too high. His blood pressure is elevated, which might be a side effect of high caffeine intake. But he's on coffee, which is a possible source. But he might need to reduce caffeine.

Wait, the options are about management. So if the patient's sleep is the issue, then the management would be either to increase his sleep, or help him fall asleep, etc.

So, the options:

C: Read and snack. That's a good approach because it can help with sleep. But is it the best option? Or is a nap better?

D: Daytime nap. That's a more direct solution. Because if he's not getting enough sleep, he might need to take a nap.

So, the question is, is it better to encourage him to read and snack, or to help him get a longer nap.

I recall that sleep apnea management often involves either encouraging sleep or providing additional cues. But in this case, the patient is not having a lot of sleep. So, maybe the best approach is to suggest a longer nap. That would be option D.

Option C is a good idea but a one-time solution. Option D is better as a long-term solution.

So the correct answer should be D: Advise the patient to take a daytime nap.

The patient is a retired postal worker with an active lifestyle, high blood pressure, and no sleep apnea. The patient's sleep issue is morning awakenings between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. Vital signs indicate a healthy individual, and the physical exam suggests adequate developments with no major issues like apnea or obesity. The patient's main concern is sleep, so the management should address his lack of adequate rest.

**Option A** is a comfort measure but not the first line of response. **Option B** could help if the patient is responding well, but it's not the best initial advice. **Option C** suggests reading and snacking, which can help with sleep relaxation but is a short-term solution. **Option D** proposes a daytime nap, which is a more direct and effective solution for prolonged sleep deprivation. **Option E** involves exercise, which he may be engaging in, so this isn't necessary. **Option F** and **G** are irrelevant as they don't address the root cause of his sleep issue. **Option H** and **J** are unrelated to his current health condition.

Given the patient's active lifestyle and elevated blood pressure, the best management is to encourage a daytime nap to help him fall asleep and recover.

**Answer: D**
