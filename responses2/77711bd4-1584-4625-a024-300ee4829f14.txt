Question:

What is the elasticity of demand?

Options:

A: Elasticity of demand is the ratio of income change to the change in quantity demanded
B: Elasticity of demand is the total revenue divided by the change in quantity of a good sold
C: Elasticity of demand is the measure of the speed at which goods are produced in response to market demands
D: Elasticity of demand is the change in quantity demanded in response to changes in market conditions other than price
E: Elasticity of demand is the change in quantity supplied due to a change in consumer preferences
F: Elasticity of demand is a measure of the extent to which quantity of a good demanded responds to changes in the price of the good
G: Elasticity of demand is the ratio of price to quantity demanded
H: Elasticity of demand is the percentage change in price
I: Elasticity of demand is the change in quantity demanded
J: Elasticity of demand is the change in the price of one good in response to a change in the price of another good

Okay, so I have this question about elasticity of demand. Hmm, I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. Let me think about what I know. 

I think elasticity is usually calculated using the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. So, it's a ratio involving price and quantity. Let me look at the options again.

Option F says elasticity is a measure of the extent to which quantity demanded responds to price changes. That sounds right because elasticity is all about responsiveness. So F might be the correct answer.

Wait, let me check the other options to be sure. Option G is the ratio of price to quantity, which doesn't sound right. Option H talks about percentage change in price, not quantity. Option I is just the change in quantity, which doesn't include percentages. Option J is about another good's price change, which is cross elasticity, not demand elasticity.

So the correct definition should be about how much quantity demanded changes with price. That's exactly what F says. So the correct answer is F.

The correct answer is F: Elasticity of demand is the measure of the extent to which quantity of a good demanded responds to changes in the price of the good.

Answer: F
