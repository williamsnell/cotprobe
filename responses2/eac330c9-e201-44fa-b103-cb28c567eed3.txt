Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0. Hmm, I remember that the tangent line to a curve at a particular point has two main things: it must pass through that point on the curve, and its slope must be equal to the derivative of the function at that point.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to find the point on the curve where x = 0. So I plug x = 0 into the equation y = x + e^x. Let me calculate that:

When x = 0, y = 0 + e^0. Wait, e^0 is 1, right? So y = 1. So the point is (0,1). Got that down.

Next, I need to find the slope of the tangent line at that point. The slope is given by the derivative of y with respect to x at x = 0. Let me compute dy/dx for y = x + e^x.

The derivative of x with respect to x is 1. The derivative of e^x is e^x. So putting it together, dy/dx = 1 + e^x. Now, evaluate this at x = 0. So e^0 is 1 again. So dy/dx at x=0 is 1 + 1 = 2. So the slope is 2.

Now that I have the slope and a point on the line, I can write the equation of the tangent line. The point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is the point. Plugging in m = 2 and the point (0,1), I get:

y - 1 = 2(x - 0)

Simplifying that, it becomes y = 2x + 1.

Looking at the options, option G is y = 2x + 1. So that's the answer.

The tangent line to the curve at x = 0 has a slope of 2 and passes through the point (0,1). Using the point-slope form, the equation is y = 2x + 1. 

Answer: G
