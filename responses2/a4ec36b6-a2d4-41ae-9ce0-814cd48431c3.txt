Question:

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spring and a glider on an air track. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says the setup: a spring is mounted horizontally with the left end fixed. A spring balance is attached to the free end and pulled to the right, showing that the force is proportional to displacement, which I think means it's a spring force problem. 

The given data is a force of 6.0 N causes a displacement of 0.030 m. So, I remember Hooke's Law here, which says F = -kx. Wait, but in this case, we're probably dealing with the spring constant k. So solving for k: k = F/x. Plugging in the numbers, 6.0 N divided by 0.030 m. Let me calculate that. 6 / 0.03 is 200, right? So k = 200 N/m.

Then, they replace the spring balance with a 0.50-kg glider. It's pulled 0.020 m to the right and released from rest. We need to find the period of the oscillation. Hmm, this sounds like simple harmonic motion. The period T of a mass-spring system is given by T = 2π√(m/k), right?

So, the mass m is 0.50 kg, and k is 200 N/m. Let's plug those into the formula. First, calculate the square root part. 0.5 / 200 is 0.0025. The square root of 0.0025 is 0.05. So √(0.5/200) is 0.05. Then multiply by 2π, which is approximately 6.283. So 0.05 * 6.283 is about 0.314 seconds.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let me redo the calculation step by step.

m = 0.5 kg, k = 200 N/m.

The formula is T = 2π√(m/k).

So, m/k is 0.5 / 200 = 0.0025.

√0.0025 is 0.05 (since 0.05 squared is 0.0025).

Then, 2π * 0.05 = 0.1 * π = approx 0.314 seconds.

Looking at the options given:

A: 0.45
B: 0.22
C: 0.37
D: 0.40
E: 0.20
F: 0.50
G: 0.31
H: 0.25
I: 0.35
J: 0.28

So option G is 0.31, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the spring constant \( k \) using Hooke's Law, \( F = kx \). Given \( F = 6.0 \, \text{N} \) and \( x = 0.030 \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{6.0}{0.030} = 200 \, \text{N/m}.
\]

Next, we analyze the glider's motion. The glider has a mass \( m = 0.50 \, \text{kg} \) and is oscillating on a frictionless air track. The period \( T \) of simple harmonic motion for a mass-spring system is given by:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}.
\]

Substituting \( m = 0.50 \, \text{kg} \) and \( k = 200 \, \text{N/m} \):

\[
\frac{m}{k} = \frac{0.50}{200} = 0.0025, \quad \sqrt{0.0025} = 0.05, \quad T = 2\pi \cdot 0.05 = 0.1\pi \approx 0.314 \, \text{s}.
\]

Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is \( 0.31 \, \text{s} \), which corresponds to option G.
