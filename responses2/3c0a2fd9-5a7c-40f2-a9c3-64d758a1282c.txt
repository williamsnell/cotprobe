Okay, so I've got this question about the advantages and disadvantages of using pure time-series models versus structural models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my econometrics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking which is a disadvantage of pure time-series models. The options are A to D. Let me try to recall what I know about these models.

Pure time-series models use historical data to predict future trends. They don't consider external factors or cause and effect relationships. So, they focus solely on the data itself. On the other hand, structural models are more complex because they incorporate economic principles, like supply and demand, and consider structural elements such as lagged variables and possibly exogenous shocks.

Looking at the options:

Option A: They are not theoretically motivated. Wait, time-series models are definitely theoretical because they're based on statistical models and the underlying data generating process. Structural models are more grounded in economic theory, so this might not be a disadvantage. So A might not be the correct answer.

Option B: They cannot produce forecasts easily. I think time-series models are pretty straightforward because they can handle trends, seasonality, and other patterns using methods like ARIMA or exponential smoothing. They're relatively easy to implement, so B could be a disadvantage, but I need to think if it's the right choice.

Option C: They cannot be used for very high frequency data. Time-series models typically require data points regularly spaced, like daily or monthly. High-frequency data might require something like econometric models that can handle more granular data. So this could be a limitation, making C a possible answer.

Option D: It is difficult to determine the appropriate explanatory variables for use in pure time-series models. Right, pure time-series models don't have a priori variables. They just use the data they have. So if you have a lot of variables, it's tricky to include them all. That's definitely a problem because the model's effectiveness depends on having the right explanatory variables. So D seems like a strong candidate for a disadvantage.

The question is about which is a disadvantage. Let's see the question again: "Which of the following is a DISADVANTAGE of using pure time-series models (relative to structural models)?"

Structural models include these assumptions and variables, so using a pure model without them can be a problem. So D is a disadvantage because in pure time-series, you can't choose variables; you have to rely on the data.

Option B is about forecast ease. Time-series models, especially ARIMA, can be used for forecasting, but they might not handle certain complexities as well as structural models. But the question is about a disadvantage relative to structural models, so B might not be as directly about the model's strength relative to the other approach.

Wait, the question says "relative to structural models." So the question is about comparing these two approaches. Structural models are better because they can handle more variables and incorporate theory, whereas pure models use only the data. So a disadvantage for pure models would be that they can't handle things like lagged variables or external shocks, which structural models can.

So the correct answer is D: It's difficult to determine the appropriate explanatory variables. Because pure models don't have variables to include; they just use what's in the data. So the model can't be easily adjusted for variables, which is a big disadvantage.

The question asks which is a disadvantage of using pure time-series models relative to structural models. Here's the analysis:

- **Option A**: Pure time-series models are theoretically motivated, unlike structural models. This makes A incorrect.
- **Option B**: While time-series models are capable of forecasting, they may not handle complex scenarios as effectively as structural models. However, this is not the direct disadvantage of pure models.
- **Option C**: Pure models struggle with high-frequency data due to its granularity. This is a limitation but not the most direct disadvantage relative to structural models.
- **Option D**: Pure models cannot determine appropriate explanatory variables, as they rely solely on the data. This is a clear disadvantage, as structural models can incorporate external variables.

The correct answer is **D**, as it directly addresses the limitation of pure time-series models not being able to include explanatory variables, a key feature of structural models. 

Answer: D
