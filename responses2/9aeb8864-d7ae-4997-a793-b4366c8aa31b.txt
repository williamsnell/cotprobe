Okay, so I've got this problem here about figuring out the best buy among several options. Let me see how to approach this. The question is asking which option is the best deal, meaning I need to find the lowest cost per bar of soap. 

First, I think I should calculate the price per bar for each option. That makes sense because the lower the price per unit, the better the deal. So, for each option, I'll take the total price and divide it by the number of bars. 

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 17 bars for $38.72. So, 38.72 divided by 17. Let me do the division: 17 goes into 38 twice (17*2=34), subtract 34 from 38, that leaves 4. Bring down the 7, making 47. 17 into 47 is 2 times (17*2=34), subtract 34 from 47 gives 13. Bring down the 2, making 132. 17 into 132 is 7 times (17*7=119), subtracting gives 13. So, 2.276 per bar. Hmm, that's approximately $2.28 per bar.

Option B: 16 bars for $36.48. Let's divide 36.48 by 16. 16 into 36 is 2 times (32), subtract to get 4. Bring down the 4, making 44. 16 into 44 is 2 (32), subtract to get 12. Bring down 8, making 128. 16 into 128 is 8. So total is 2.28 per bar. Same as A.

Option C: 12 bars for $27.60. 27.60 divided by 12. 12 into 27 is 2 (24), remainder 3. Bring down 6, making 36. 12 into 36 is 3. Bring down 0, making 0. So 2.30 per bar. So that's more expensive than A and B.

Option D: 20 bars for $45.00. 45 divided by 20 is 2.25 per bar. So, a bit cheaper than A and B.

Option E: 11 bars for $25.08. 25.08 divided by 11. Let's see: 11 into 25 is 2 (22), remainder 3. Bring down 0, making 30. 11 into 30 is 2 (22), remainder 8. Bring down 8, making 88. 11 into 88 is 8. So total is $2.28 per bar. So same as A and B.

Option F: 10 bars for $23.20. 23.20 divided by 10 is $2.32 per bar. That's more expensive than A, B, E.

Option G: 15 bars for $34.50. 34.50 divided by 15. 15 into 34 is 2 (30), remainder 4. Bring down 5, making 45. 15 into 45 is 3. So 2.30 per bar. Same as C.

Option H: 18 bars for $40.68. 40.68 divided by 18. Let me compute this: 18 into 40 is 2 (36), remainder 4. Bring down 6, making 46. 18 into 46 is 2 (36), remainder 10. Bring down 8, making 108. 18 into 108 is 6. So total is 2.26 per bar. Wait, that's lower than A, B, E. So H is better.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 18 into 40.68:

18 * 2 = 36. Subtract 36 from 40.68, gives 4.68.

18 * 0.26 is 4.68. So 2.26 per bar. So that's cheaper.

Option I: 14 bars for $31.92. 31.92 divided by 14. Let's calculate: 14 into 31 is 2 (28), remainder 3. Bring down 9, making 39. 14 into 39 is 2 (28), remainder 11. Bring down 2, making 112. 14 into 112 is 8. So total is 2.28 per bar, same as A and B.

Option J: 13 bars for $29.51. 29.51 divided by 13. Let's see: 13 into 29 is 2 (26), remainder 3. Bring down 5, making 35. 13 into 35 is 2 (26), remainder 9. Bring down 1, making 91. 13 into 91 is 7. So total is $2.27 per bar. So that's a little cheaper than A, B, E, H, I.

So let's compile the per-unit prices:

A: ~$2.28

B: $2.28

C: $2.30

D: $2.25

E: $2.28

F: $2.32

G: $2.30

H: $2.26

I: $2.28

J: $2.27

So the lowest is H at $2.26 per bar, then J at $2.27, then A and E at $2.28, then D at $2.25. So the best buy is H.

The best buy is option H, which offers soap at $2.26 per bar.

Answer: H
