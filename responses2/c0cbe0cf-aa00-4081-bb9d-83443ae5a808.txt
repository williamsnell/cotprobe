Alright, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, okay, let's read it again.

The problem says that X and Y are two independent discrete random variables, each defined on the set of positive integers. Their probability distribution is the same, meaning for each positive integer n, the probability that X equals n is 1/2^n. Same for Y. Now, they want the probability that at least one of X or Y is greater than 3. So, what's the probability that X > 3 or Y > 3?

I remember that when dealing with "at least one" scenarios, it's often easier to calculate the complement and subtract from 1. The complement of "X > 3 or Y > 3" is "both X ≤ 3 and Y ≤ 3." That might simplify things.

So, let me break it down. First, I'll find the probability that both X and Y are ≤3. Since X and Y are independent, their probabilities multiply. So, the probability that X ≤3 is the sum of P(X=1), P(X=2), P(X=3). Each of these is (1/2)^1, (1/2)^2, (1/2)^3 respectively. So adding those up:

1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = (4/8 + 2/8 + 1/8) = 7/8. So P(X ≤3) = 7/8.

Same for Y, since it's the same distribution. So, P(Y ≤3) is also 7/8.

Since X and Y are independent, P(X ≤3 and Y ≤3) = P(X ≤3) * P(Y ≤3) = (7/8) * (7/8) = 49/64.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Because X and Y are independent, but when I'm calculating the probability that both are ≤3, it's correct. So the probability that both are ≤3 is indeed 49/64. So then, the probability that at least one is >3 is 1 minus this, which is 1 - 49/64 = 15/64.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, I could calculate the probability that X >3 or Y>3 directly. How would that go? Well, sometimes it's easier to compute the probability of the union as P(X>3) + P(Y>3) - P(X>3 and Y>3). But because X and Y are independent, P(X>3 and Y>3) is [P(X>3)]^2.

So, first, let's find P(X>3). Since P(X ≤3) is 7/8, then P(X>3) is 1 - 7/8 = 1/8.

Same for Y, so P(Y>3) is also 1/8. Now, what's P(X>3 and Y>3)? It's (1/8)*(1/8) = 1/64.

So, putting it all together, the probability that X>3 or Y>3 is 1/8 + 1/8 - 1/64 = (8/64 + 8/64 - 1/64) = 15/64. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's consistent.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the first approach. So, the first approach found the complement as 49/64, so 1-49/64 is 15/64. The second approach gives the same result. So, either way, the probability is 15/64.

Looking at the options, option D is 15/64. So that must be the answer.

The problem involves calculating the probability that at least one of two independent random variables, X and Y, exceeds 3. Using the complement rule simplifies the calculation. By finding the probability that both X and Y are ≤3, and subtracting from 1, we get the desired probability. This approach is confirmed by calculating the probabilities directly, yielding the same result.

Answer: D: 15/64
