Okay, so I've got this question about decision making biases, specifically about the term for a 'rule of thumb' type of bias. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

First, let me recall what each of these terms refers to. The question is asking for the term corresponding to the rule of thumb bias. I remember that biases in decision making can be categorized in different ways, often based on the cognitive processes involved.

Rule of thumb bias, also known as the anchoring bias, is a type of cognitive biases. The anchoring bias refers to situations where people rely too much on the first piece of information they receive, which can influence subsequent judgments. For example, if someone hears that a new policy will cut taxes, they might anchor their decision on that information and ignore other relevant factors.

Wait, the options given include several terms. Let me go through them one by one to see which one matches.

Option A: Framing bias. I think framing bias is about how information is presented. People might make different decisions based on how they're framed, like whether it's presented as a benefit or a problem.

Option B: Availability bias. I believe this is when people overemphasize information based on how easily it comes to mind. For example, if news about plane crashes are more common in the news, people might overestimate the risk of accidents.

Option C: Representativeness bias. This is when people make judgments based on how typical a certain case is in a group, not on relevant statistical information. For example, if someone is a tall person, they might think they're more likely to be a thief, ignoring factors like experience or knowledge of thief rates.

Option D: Self-serving bias. This is when people make decisions based on their own interests or values, not on rational analysis. So, for instance, someone might choose a job that pays well if they're more interested in financial success.

Option E: Hindsight bias. This is the tendency to overestimate the accuracy of one's past decisions after the event. Like, if you're told that you won the lottery, you might think you were lucky.

Option F: Over-confidence bias. This is when people believe their judgments are more accurate than they actually are, leading them to be overly confident. For example, people might think they've predicted the stock market accurately when they're not sure.

Option G: Confirmation bias. This is about the tendency to seek out information that confirms one's existing beliefs. People might discard information that contradicts their preconceptions.

Option H: Optimism bias. This is when people overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes. For example, they might think a coin flip is more likely to land on heads.

Option I: Anchoring bias. Oh, wait, this is similar to what I thought about earlier. It's when the first piece of information (the anchor) has a larger influence on the final decision than other relevant factors.

Option J: Heuristics. Heuristics are mental shortcuts people use to make judgments quickly. They are often efficient, but they can sometimes lead to errors or biases.

The question is specifically about the 'rule of thumb' type of bias. I'm pretty sure that rule of thumb bias is a subset of the heuristics category. Heuristics involve these mental shortcuts, and rule of thumb bias is when people rely too heavily on one piece of information, ignoring others.

Wait, but looking back, I think that anchoring bias (Option I) is a specific type of heuristic where the first piece of information (the anchor) dominates the decision. So, yes, the rule of thumb is part of the broader category of heuristics.

So the correct term should be Heuristics. Looking at the options, J is Heuristics. That should be the answer.

The term for the rule of thumb type of bias in decision making is Heuristics. 

Answer: J: Heuristics
