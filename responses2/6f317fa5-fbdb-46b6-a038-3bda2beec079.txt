Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the kinked demand curve and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me think about what I remember regarding the kinked demand curve.

The question is asking which statement is incorrect with respect to the kinked demand curve. The options are A to D.

First, I need to recall what a kinked demand curve looks like. I remember that the kinked demand curve is a model used in oligopoly theory where firms have a limited ability to increase prices due to maximum capacity. So, when a firm raises its price above the minimum average cost, it can do so without losing all its customers because the demand curve doesn't change much—only kinks at that price level. However, if a firm lowers its price, it can expect that its competitor won't follow, so the demand might drop a lot, leading to a sharp decline in quantity demanded.

Now, the possible statements:

Option A: There is no price leader. Price leadership is when a single firm dominates the market, setting prices and influencing others. But in a kinked demand curve, if one firm lowers its price, others might follow, so the kinked demand curve suggests that price leadership isn't possible. So A is saying there's no price leader, which I think is correct. So A is not the wrong statement.

Option B: There are relatively equal shares of the market. Wait, I'm not sure. If a firm drops prices below its minimum average cost, it can lose a lot of market share. So in cases where firms have significant market power, they might have larger shares. But I'm not certain if the kinked demand curve suggests equal shares or not. Alternatively, in a situation where no price leadership occurs, maybe the market shares are more equal because each firm is priced at the minimum average cost. But I'm not sure. Maybe B is correct—it's an assumption in the model that prices are set at the minimum average cost, leading to equal shares. So B could be correct, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Price is greater than marginal costs. Because in the kinked demand curve, firms have limited ability to set prices above their minimum average cost. If they do, they risk losing customers. So the price must be above marginal cost to capture some profit. So C is correct. So the statement that's incorrect would not say that price is above marginal cost.

Option D: The demand curve is of one continuous function. Wait, the kinked demand curve has two different segments. The demand curve has a kink where price drops sharply. So the demand curve isn't one continuous function—it has a discontinuity or a kink. So D says it's one continuous function, which is incorrect. So D is the incorrect statement.

Wait, let me make sure. The kinked demand curve has two segments: one with a higher slope (elastic demand) above the kink and a steeper slope (inelastic) below. So it's not a single continuous curve—it's a piecewise function. So D is incorrect because it's not a continuous function. Therefore, the question is asking which is NOT correct, meaning the incorrect statement is D.

So looking at the options, the options:

A: No price leader → correct.

B: Equal shares → might be correct. If all firms set price at average cost, then the market shares would be equal. So B is correct.

C: Price > marginal cost → correct.

D: Not continuous → correct.

The question is which is NOT correct. So the incorrect statement is D.

So the answer would be D.

To determine which statement is NOT correct regarding the kinked demand curve, let's analyze each option:

1. **Option A**: "There is no price leader."  
   The kinked demand curve model suggests that price leadership is not feasible because firms cannot easily raise prices above the minimum average cost without losing significant market share. Thus, this statement is **correct**.

2. **Option B**: "There are relatively equal shares of the market."  
   In the kinked demand curve model, firms are assumed to set prices at the minimum average cost, leading to equal market shares. This statement is **correct**.

3. **Option C**: "Price is greater than marginal costs."  
   Firms must set prices above marginal costs to cover their costs and ensure profitability. This statement is **correct**.

4. **Option D**: "The demand curve is of one continuous function."  
   The kinked demand curve is a piecewise function with a kink, meaning it is not a single continuous curve. This statement is **incorrect**.

The question asks for the statement that is NOT correct, so the answer is **D**.

**ANSWER: D**
