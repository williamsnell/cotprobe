Okay, so I have this question here about cognitive distortions, specifically about a person named Samuel S. who's saying something about feeling fired despite a bonus. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that cognitive distortions are ways people distort information or make irrational judgments. Aaron Beck defined some of these, so I should focus on that. The question is asking which of the options corresponds to Samuel's situation.

Samuel says, "Even though I've just been given a bonus at work, I feel like I’m about to be fired." So, he's taking a positive action (bonus) and associating it with a negative outcome (fired). That sounds like a negative association or a distortion where people overemphasize positive outcomes and ignore negative ones.

Looking at the options:

A: Polarized thinking. This is when people make decisions based on their personality's dominant thinking style. That doesn't seem to fit because Samuel is feeling fired, which is more about emotions than personality.

B: Magnification. Hmm, I think magnification is when someone makes a big mistake by overgeneralizing. For example, they might take a small action and apply it to a larger situation. But in this case, it's a specific negative outcome from a specific action, not overgeneralizing a small thing into a bigger one.

C: Minimization. That's when you ignore negative outcomes to maximize positive ones. So, when you minimize, you're not considering the bad aspects. But Samuel is feeling fired, which is a negative outcome, so he's minimizing that by associating it with the bonus. So maybe this is the opposite of what he's doing.

D: Arbitrary inference. I'm not too sure. Arbitrary inference is when someone makes a conclusion based on a vague or unrelated premise. Like, saying because I saw something at the store, I think it's a good idea. That doesn't quite fit because he's taking a specific action and associating it with a negative outcome.

E: Overgeneralization. That's when someone takes a specific case and applies it to a broader category. For example, if someone says that because I saw a dog in the park today, I'll always be afraid of dogs. It's applying the specific case to a generalization. But here, Samuel is taking a specific action (bonus) and associating it with a specific negative outcome (fired). It's about the same specific case applied to a different outcome, not a generalization.

F: Mustabatory thinking. I'm not familiar with this one. Mustabatory usually refers to thinking that you're in a position of power because you're in a position of power, but I don't recall it being one of the standard distortions defined by Aaron Beck.

G: Mind reading. That's a bit of a stretch. Mind reading is when someone interprets others' actions or thoughts as meaning something, but in this case, Samuel is just describing a situation, not interpreting others.

H: Selective abstraction. This is when you filter out information, focusing on certain aspects while ignoring others. But Samuel is not selectively abstracting; he's directly associating the bonus with a negative outcome.

I: Personalization. That's when you tailor your thinking to your unique situation. But Samuel isn't personalizing; he's just pointing out the correlation between a specific action and a negative outcome.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. Polarized thinking is about personality, which doesn't fit. Magnification is about overgeneralizing, but Samuel isn't overgeneralizing. Minimization is ignoring the negative outcome, which is exactly what he's doing. So Samuel is minimizing the negative outcome by associating it with the positive bonus.

So the answer should be C: minimization.

The question involves identifying the cognitive distortion Samuel S. exhibits. Samuel mentions a positive action (bonus) and associates it with a negative outcome (fired), which is a form of minimization. 

**Answer:**
C: minimization
