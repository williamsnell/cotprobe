Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the energy required to transfer one electron from an isolated sodium atom (Na) to an isolated chlorine atom (Cl). I remember that ionization potential and electron affinity are related to the energy changes when atoms gain or lose electrons.

Wait, ionization potential is the energy needed to remove an electron from an atom. So for sodium, it's given as 5.1 eV. That makes sense because sodium typically has a low ionization potential, meaning it's relatively easy to lose an electron.

Then there's electron affinity, which is the energy change when an atom gains an electron. Chlorine's electron affinity is 3.6 eV. Hmm, electron affinity is the energy released when the atom gains an electron. So a positive value means it's exothermic, releasing energy.

But wait, the question is about transferring an electron. So from sodium to chlorine. So the process would involve sodium losing an electron (ionization) and chlorine gaining an electron (gaining). Or wait, does it go the other way? Let me think.

If I want to transfer an electron from Na to Cl, that would mean Na loses an electron (ionization) and Cl gains one (electron affinity). Or wait, maybe Cl is losing an electron, but that's not the case here. Let me clarify the process.

The scenario: Sodium (Na) is an isolated atom, and Chlorine (Cl) is another. We want to transfer an electron from Na to Cl. So Na loses an electron, so it's ionized, and Cl gains an electron, so it becomes Cl^-.

So the energy required for this transfer would be the sum of the ionization energy of Na and the electron affinity of Cl.

Wait, because when you ionize Na, you're adding energy (5.1 eV), and when Cl gains an electron, it releases energy (3.6 eV). But wait, the question says the energy required to transfer one electron. So perhaps we're considering the energy needed to move the electron from Na to Cl, which would require the ionization energy of Na and the electron affinity of Cl.

Wait, no. Alternatively, another approach: the process of Cl gaining an electron (from Na's perspective) would be the electron affinity, so the energy required would be the sum of the two energies.

Wait, no. Because the energy required to transfer an electron would be the energy to remove it from Na (ionization energy) plus the energy to bring it in (electron affinity). Wait, but if Cl is taking that electron, then Cl is losing it, so it's releasing energy. So the energy required for Na to lose an electron (ionization) and Cl to gain it (electron affinity). Or is it the reverse?

Let me think again. When you transfer an electron from Na to Cl, it's moving from Na to Cl. So Na loses an electron (since it's giving it away) and Cl gains an electron (it's taking it in). So for Na, the energy needed is the ionization energy (since that's the energy to remove the electron from Na). For Cl, if it gains an electron, that's its electron affinity. But wait, electron affinity is the energy change when Cl gains an electron. Since Cl's EA is 3.6 eV, that's the energy released. So for Cl, losing an electron (gaining) would have an energy change of -3.6 eV.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. The energy required for Cl to gain an electron is actually the energy released, so the amount of energy that is consumed when Cl gains the electron is the same as the negative of its electron affinity. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the energy required to transfer an electron from Na to Cl would be the energy needed to remove that electron from Na (so ionization) plus the energy required to bring it into Cl (electron affinity). Because it's going from Na to Cl, so the electron is leaving Na and entering Cl.

But wait, when Cl gains an electron, that's its electron affinity. So for Cl, the electron affinity is the energy change when it gains an electron. So if Cl gains an electron (from the Na), the energy change is +3.6 eV (since EA is the energy released, but the Cl gains, so it's positive energy change for the system).

Wait, no. Wait, the electron affinity is the energy change when Cl gains an electron. So for Cl, gaining an electron releases energy. So the energy is negative. So the energy required to transfer an electron from Na to Cl would be the ionization energy of Na plus the (negative) electron affinity of Cl? Or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the overall energy change. Let me think of it as: when Na loses an electron (ionization), it requires 5.1 eV. Then, Cl gains that electron to become Cl^- (which would involve an energy change of -3.6 eV from Cl's perspective).

Wait, but the question is about the energy required to transfer one electron from Na to Cl. So, the process is Na -> Na+ + e (ionization energy 5.1 eV) and then Cl gains the electron to become Cl^- (electron affinity 3.6 eV, which is the energy released).

But wait, no. The transfer is from Na to Cl. So the electron is leaving Na and entering Cl. So the energy required would be the energy needed to remove the electron from Na (5.1 eV) plus the energy required to add the electron to Cl (electron affinity, which is 3.6 eV, so positive when Cl gains it).

Wait, another way: the energy required to transfer that electron would be the sum of these two. Let me compute that: 5.1 (Na) + 3.6 (Cl) = 8.7 eV. But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 8.7 as an option but option G is 4.7. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing the signs.

Perhaps the correct calculation is the ionization energy of Na (5.1 eV) and the negation of the electron affinity of Cl. Because Cl is the one that's gaining the electron, so for Cl to gain it, it's losing energy. So the energy required would be the sum of the ionization energy (removing from Na) plus the energy change for Cl to gain the electron (which is negative, but you might take the negative of that, or think in terms of energy required).

Wait, maybe it's the ionization energy and the negative of the electron affinity. Because when Cl gains an electron, the energy change is -3.6 eV. So the energy required for that process is 5.1 (Na) + (-3.6) (Cl) = 1.5 eV. Oh wait, that's 1.5 eV. But looking at the options, H is 1.5 eV.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy required to transfer an electron from Na to Cl would be the energy needed for Na to lose the electron (ionization) plus the energy required for Cl to gain the electron (which is EA, but with a negative sign because it's exothermic).

So the calculation would be:

Energy = Ionization energy (Na) + (Electron affinity (Cl) * (-1))

Because when Cl gains the electron, it's losing energy, so the energy change is negative. The energy required would be the sum of the two positive energies.

So 5.1 eV (Na) + 3.6 eV (Cl) = 8.7 eV. But that's not an option. Wait, the options don't have 8.7. Hmm. Let me look again.

The options are:
A:6.3eV
B:2.1eV
C:8.7eV
D:3.5eV
E:7.2eV
F:1.6eV
G:4.7eV
H:1.5eV
I:2.5eV
J:0.5eV

So option C is 8.7. But in this case, that's the sum of the energies. But the question is about transferring an electron, so perhaps I'm not considering the direction correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider the energy required as the sum of the ionization energy of Na and the energy released by Cl (electron affinity). But that would not add up. Or perhaps it's the negative of the electron affinity.

Wait, another approach: transferring the electron from Na to Cl would require the energy to remove it from Na (5.1 eV) and the energy to bring it in (the electron affinity of Cl, which is 3.6 eV from Cl's perspective). But since Cl is gaining the electron, it's losing energy, so the energy required for that process would be the sum of 5.1 and 3.6. But in that case, the answer would be 8.7 eV, which is option C. But that's not an option I see. Wait, I'm looking at the options, and option C is 8.7eV. But wait, the options given are:

Looking at the options again:

A:6.3eV

B:2.1eV

C:8.7eV

D:3.5eV

E:7.2eV

F:1.6eV

G:4.7eV

H:1.5eV

I:2.5eV

J:0.5eV

So option C is 8.7eV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I need to consider that the energy required is the sum of the ionization energy of Na and the electron affinity of Cl. Because ionization of Na releases 5.1 eV, and Cl gains the electron at 3.6 eV. The total energy change would be 5.1 + (-3.6) = 1.5 eV. But that doesn't fit any option except H:1.5eV.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the electron affinity of Cl confused with where it's coming from. The electron affinity of Cl is for when Cl gains an electron. So, Cl's EA is the energy change when Cl gains an electron. So if Cl gains an electron, the energy change is +3.6 eV (for the Cl atom, it's losing energy). But from the perspective of the reaction from Na to Cl, the energy required would be the energy from Na losing an electron (5.1 eV) plus the energy that the Cl gains (3.6 eV, which is a positive when Cl gains the electron).

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to think that the transfer of an electron from Na to Cl would require the energy for both processes. So it's 5.1 eV (Na loses electron) and 3.6 eV (Cl gains electron). Wait, but 3.6 eV is the energy released in Cl's case, so the energy required for Cl to gain that electron is 3.6 eV (since the process is exothermic, but the energy is needed, so the energy is positive).

Wait, that makes sense. Because when Cl gains an electron, it's releasing energy (so the energy required for that process is positive). So the total energy required would be 5.1 (Na) + 3.6 (Cl) = 8.7 eV. But option C is 8.7eV, but wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that the energy required to transfer an electron from Na to Cl would be the sum of the ionization energy of Na and the electron affinity of Cl. Because both processes are exothermic in their own right, but when you're moving an electron, you're combining both.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of the overall process. The electron is being transferred from Na to Cl. So:

1. Na loses an electron: energy required is 5.1 eV (ionization).
2. Cl gains the electron: energy released is 3.6 eV (electron affinity).

So the net energy change is (5.1 eV) + (-3.6 eV) = 1.5 eV. But that's the energy change from Na to Cl. But the question is about the energy required to transfer one electron. So perhaps the energy required is the sum of these two values (5.1 + 3.6) = 8.7 eV. Because in the process, both steps are happening: the Na loses the electron, and the Cl gains it. So the energy required is the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to subtract. Wait, another way: The energy required is the energy to remove the electron from Na (5.1 eV) plus the energy needed for Cl to accept it (electron affinity, which is 3.6 eV, but since it's the electron being taken from Cl, the energy required would actually be the sum because it's a transfer anyway).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the formula. The energy required for the transfer is the sum of the ionization energy of Na and the (negative of) the electron affinity of Cl. Because:

- Na loses an electron: 5.1 eV (ionization energy).
- Cl gains the electron: energy change is -3.6 eV (since it's exothermic, releasing energy).

So the total energy change is 5.1 eV + (-3.6 eV) = 1.5 eV. But wait, that's the net change when Cl gains the electron. But the question is about the energy required. So the energy required would be the sum of the two energies because both processes are occurring, regardless of their signs. So the energy required is 5.1 + 3.6 = 8.7 eV. That would correspond to option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such questions, the way the energies are added depends on the direction. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Energy required = Ionization energy of Na + (Electron affinity of Cl * (-1)).

So 5.1 + (-3.6) = 1.5 eV. But that would be the energy change for the overall process. But the question is about the energy required to transfer an electron, which would require both steps: removing it from Na and adding it to Cl. So the total energy required is 5.1 + 3.6 = 8.7 eV. So option C is the correct one.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let's think about the energy for the transfer. For each electron transfer, the energy required is the sum of the ionization energy of Na and the electron affinity of Cl. So the energy required is 5.1 + 3.6 = 8.7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 8.7eV. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the energy required to transfer one electron from an isolated sodium (Na) atom to an isolated chlorine (Cl) atom, we consider the following:

1. **Ionization Energy of Sodium (Na):**  
   The energy required to remove an electron from a neutral sodium atom is **5.1 eV**. This is the energy change for the ionization process.

2. **Electron Affinity of Chlorine (Cl):**  
   The energy change when a neutral chlorine atom gains an electron is **3.6 eV**. Since chlorine is gaining an electron, this energy change is exothermic, meaning it releases energy.

3. **Energy Required for the Transfer:**  
   To transfer an electron from Na to Cl, we need to account for both the ionization energy of Na and the electron affinity of Cl. The energy required is the sum of these two values because both processes are occurring simultaneously:
   \[
   \text{Energy required} = \text{Ionization energy of Na} + \text{Electron affinity of Cl}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Energy required} = 5.1 \, \text{eV} + 3.6 \, \text{eV} = 8.7 \, \text{eV}
   \]

4. **Answer Selection:**  
   Among the provided options, the correct answer is **8.7 eV**, which corresponds to option C.
