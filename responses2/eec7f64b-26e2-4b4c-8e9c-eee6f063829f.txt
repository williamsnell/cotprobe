Alright, so I've got this logic problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about determining an immediate consequence (one-step) in propositional logic (PL) from the given premises. The premises provided are:

1. ~E ⊃ ~F
2. G ⊃ F
3. H ∨ ~E
4. H ⊃ I
5. ~I

And the options are A through J, each presenting a different proposition. I need to find which of these is a direct consequence of the premises.

First, I'll try to understand each premise and see how they connect. It might help to write down each in a more standard form or figure out their logical forms.

Let's look at each premise:

1. ~E implies ~F. In other words, if E is true, then F must be false. So, E → ~F.
2. G implies F. So, G → F.
3. H or not E. So, H ∨ ~E.
4. H implies I. So, H → I.
5. Not I. So, ~I.

I need to find an immediate consequence, meaning a conclusion that directly follows from these premises without any circular reasoning.

Hmm, since premise 5 is ~I, perhaps I can use that to connect to others. Let me see.

From premise 4: H → I. If H is true, then I must be true. But premise 5 says I is false. So, if H were true, I would have to be true, but I is not. Therefore, H must be false. So, H → ~I. But since ~I is premise 5, that's consistent.

So, H → ~I. But I is given as ~I. So, if H is true, then I would have to be both true and false, which can't be. Therefore, H must be false. So, H is false. So, ~H.

Wait, that's an important conclusion: H is false. So, ~H is a consequence.

Now, let me see which options include ~H. Looking at the options:

A: ~H ⊃ I → That would mean if ~H, then I. But since ~H is true, and I is false, this would be false, but it's an immediate consequence? Or is it a consequence? Wait, the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence. So, the correct answer would be the one that must be true given the premises, not necessarily that it's implied by each other.

Wait, but in this case, H is false, so if any of the options say that H is false, but the options are about their implications. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should go back. Let's try to derive all the logical steps.

From premise 4: H → I. From premise 5: ~I.

So, combining these two, if H is true, then I would have to be true (from 4), but I is false (from 5). Therefore, H cannot be true. So, H must be false. So, ~H.

So, ~H is a conclusion. Now, looking at the options, which option includes ~H as a premise? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

- Option A: ~H ⊃ I. So, if ~H is true, then I must be true. But we know I is false, so this would make the implication false. So, A is not a consequence, but rather the contrary.

- Option J: F ⊃ G. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps I can find another way. Let me look at other premises.

From premise 2: G → F. So, if G is true, then F is true. But from premise 1: E → ~F. If E is true, F is false. So, E → ~F.

Wait, if E is true, then F is false. So, E → ~F. So, the contrapositive of E → ~F is F → ~E. So, F implies ~E.

Wait, from that and from premise 3: H ∨ ~E. So, if F is true, then from F → ~E, E must be false. But H ∨ ~E: if E is false, then the disjunction is true regardless of H. So, if F is true, then E is false, and H ∨ ~E is true. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's consider the premises again.

We have:

1. H ∨ ~E (premise 3)
2. G → F (premise 2)
3. E → ~F (premise 1)
4. H → I (premise 4)
5. ~I (premise 5)

From 4 and 5: H → I, and ~I. So, H can't be true, because if H were true, then I would have to be true, which contradicts 5. So, H must be false. So, ~H is a consequence.

So, ~H is a conclusion. Now, looking at the options, which ones include ~H as a premise or a derived conclusion.

Looking at each option:

A: ~H ⊃ I. Since H is false, ~H is true. So, this would mean that if ~H is true, I must be true. But we know I is false. So, the implication is false, but it's not an immediate consequence; it's a conclusion that might not hold. So, A is not a consequence.

B: G → ~F. Hmm, is that true? Let's see. From premise 1: E → ~F. And from premise 2: G → F. So, if G is true, then F is true. But if E is true, then F is false. So, if G is true, F is true, but E could be true or false. So, I'm not sure. Let's see: suppose G is true. Then, from premise 2, F is true. But from premise 1, since E → ~F, and F is true, then E must be false. So, E is false. So, from premise 3: H ∨ ~E. Since E is false, ~E is true. So, H ∨ true is true. So, no contradiction there. But does G → ~F hold? Because G is true, and F is true, so ~F is false. So, G → ~F would be G is true and F is true → ~F is false. So, the implication is false. So, G → ~F is not necessarily true. So, B is not a consequence.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let's see. Suppose G is true. Then F is true (from premise 2). From premise 1, E → ~F. Since F is true, E must be false. So, E is false. So, from premise 3: H ∨ ~E. Since E is false, ~E is true. So, whatever H is, the disjunction is true. So, no problem.

But does G → ~F hold? Since G is true and F is true, then G → ~F is false. So, the conclusion G → ~F is not valid. Therefore, B is not a consequence.

C: H → ~E. Is this a consequence? Well, from premise 3: H ∨ ~E. So, if H is true, then ~E must be true. Wait, yes, because if H is true, then in the disjunction H ∨ ~E, the first term is true. So, H → ~E is a valid conclusion. So, H implies ~E is a consequence of premise 3. But looking at the options, C is H → ~E, which is correct. So, that's an immediate consequence.

Wait, but let me check other options. Let's see, D: I → H. Would that be a consequence? From premises 4 and 5: H → I and ~I. So, if H is true, I is true. But we know I is false. So, H must be false. So, H is false. So, H → I would be (H is true) implies I is true. But since H is false, the implication is automatically true. So, H → I is a consequence. So, D is also a consequence.

But the question is, which is an immediate consequence. So, both C and D are immediate consequences. But wait, the options are listed as A to J, each with a single conclusion. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Let me go through the premises again.

Premise 1: E → ~F.

Premise 2: G → F.

Premise 3: H ∨ ~E.

Premise 4: H → I.

Premise 5: ~I.

So, from 4 and 5, H → I and ~I. So, H can't be true, because if H is true, I has to be true, but I is false. So, H must be false. Therefore, ~H is a consequence.

So, ~H is a conclusion.

Looking at the options, let's check each:

A: ~H ⊃ I. So, if ~H is true, then I must be true. But I is false. So, this implication is false. So, A is not a consequence.

B: G → ~F. Is this a consequence? Let's see. Suppose G is true. Then, from 2, F is true. From 1, since E → ~F, and F is true, E must be false. From 3, H ∨ ~E. Since E is false, ~E is true, so the disjunction is true. No contradiction. But G → ~F would be G is true → F is true → ~F is false. So, G → ~F is false. So, B is not a consequence.

C: H → ~E. So, if H is true, then ~E is true. From premise 3: H ∨ ~E. So, if H is true, then ~E must be true. So, yes, H → ~E is a valid conclusion. So, C is a consequence.

D: I → H. So, if I is true, then H is true. But premise 4 says H → I. So, if H is true, then I is true. But from 5, I is false. So, H must be false. So, H → I is equivalent to H → true. Because I is false, so I → H is H → true, which is always true. So, I → H is a consequence. So, D is also a consequence.

Wait, but can I have two correct answers? Because the options are given as A to J, and the question asks for one. Hmm. Let me double-check if any of the options are correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm being too quick. Let me try another approach. Let me try to derive each option from the premises.

Option A: ~H ⊃ I. So, if H is false, then I must be true. But I is false. So, this would be false. So, A is not a consequence.

Option B: G → ~F. So, if G is true, then F must be false. But from premise 2, G → F. So, if G is true, then F is true. Contradiction. So, G → ~F is not a consequence.

Option C: H → ~E. So, if H is true, then ~E must be true. From premise 3: H ∨ ~E. So, if H is true, then ~E is true. So, that's correct. So, C is a consequence.

Option D: I → H. So, if I is true, then H must be true. But from premise 4: H → I. So, if H is true, then I is true. But I is false. So, H can't be true. So, H must be false. So, H → I is always true, because H is false. So, D is a consequence.

Option E: ~H is a consequence. Because from premises 4 and 5, we can derive ~H. So, E is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence. So, both E and C and D might be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps multiple could be correct, but the problem says "which of the following propositions is an immediate consequence", singular, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the premises given are five, and the options are A to J.

Wait, let's try to find all the logical steps.

We have:

From premises 4 and 5: H → I and ~I. So, H → (I and ~I) → which is impossible. So, H must be false. So, ~H is a consequence.

So, ~H is a consequence, which is option E.

But looking at the options, E is ~H.

Wait, but how come I can have E and C and D as possible correct options? But the question is, which is an immediate consequence.

Wait, perhaps the question is multiple correct, but the options are labeled A to J, each a single conclusion, and the question is to select one. So, perhaps I need to check which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, since it directly follows from the premises. So, maybe the others are not.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let me see if any other options can be derived.

Option C: H → ~E. Let's see. From premises 3: H ∨ ~E. So, H implies ~E. So, yes, H → ~E is a valid conclusion. So, C is correct.

Option D: I → H. So, if I is true, then H is true. But from premise 4: H → I. So, if H is true, then I must be true. But I is false. So, H cannot be true. So, H can only be false. Therefore, I → H is always true, because H is false. So, D is correct.

So, options C and D are correct, but perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Let me check the premises again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but then I need to see if any other options are also correct.

Wait, the question says, which is an immediate consequence. So, all of C and D are consequences, but perhaps E is also a consequence. So, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me think: from premises 4 and 5, we can derive ~H. So, ~H is a consequence. So, option E is correct.

But wait, I'm getting confused because I might have multiple correct options, but the question is a single choice. Let me check the options again:

Options are:

A: ~H ⊃ I → false.

B: G → ~F → false.

C: H → ~E → correct.

D: I → H → correct.

E: ~H → correct.

So, E, C, D are correct. But the question is which is an immediate consequence. So, perhaps all three are correct. But in the options, only one is correct. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps E is correct because it directly follows from the premises. Let me think: from H ∨ ~E and H → I, and ~I, we can derive H → ~E.

So, H → ~E is correct. So, option C is correct.

Similarly, I → H is correct as I can't have I true without H, which is false.

So, perhaps the correct options are C and D as well as E. But the options are single letters, so perhaps the question is designed to have only E as the correct answer, but that seems not to be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should check each option again.

Looking at option C: H → ~E.

We have from premise 3: H ∨ ~E. So, if H is true, then ~E must be true. So, yes, H → ~E is a correct conclusion.

Option D: I → H.

We have H → I. So, contrapositive is I → ~H. So, from H → I, contrapositive is I → ~H. So, that's correct. So, I → ~H is a consequence. But option D says I → H, which is the converse. So, that's incorrect.

Wait, no, H → I is premise 4. So, the converse is I → H. But this is not necessarily true. So, I → H is not a consequence. Because if I is true, H must be true, but from H → I, we can't conclude I → H. So, I can be true without H being true. So, I → H is not a valid conclusion.

Wait, no. Let me think. From H → I, if I is true, then H could be true or false. So, I → H is not necessarily true. So, option D is incorrect.

Wait, but wait: H → I is premise 4, which is H implies I. So, if I is true, could H be false? No, because if H is false, then H → I is true, regardless of I's truth. So, I can be true even if H is false. So, I → H is not necessarily true.

So, I → H is incorrect, so option D is not a consequence.

So, correct options are C and E.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps E is the most direct consequence. So, the correct answer would be E, because ~H is a direct consequence.

Wait, but the question is, which of the following propositions is an immediate consequence. So, perhaps all of C, D, E are consequences, but the question expects only one. Perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Or perhaps the correct answer is C, D, and E, but the options are single letters. So, perhaps I should review the premises again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using formal logic.

Let me list all the premises:

1. E → ~F
2. G → F
3. H ∨ ~E
4. H → I
5. ~I

We can try to derive each option.

Option E: ~H. From premises 4 and 5, can we derive ~H?

Yes, because from 4: H → I. From 5: ~I. So, if H is true, then I must be true (from 4), but I is false (from 5), so H must be false. So, ~H is a consequence.

So, E is correct.

Now, let's see option C: H → ~E.

We have from premise 3: H ∨ ~E. So, if H is true, then ~E must be true. So, H → ~E is correct.

So, C is correct.

Option D: I → H.

We have from premise 4: H → I. So, can we derive I → H?

No, because H → I is not the same as I → H. In logic, the contrapositive of H → I is I → ~H. So, I → H is the converse, which is not necessarily true.

So, D is not a consequence.

So, correct options are E and C.

Wait, but the question is, which one is correct. So, perhaps both E and C are correct, but in the options, only E is present. Wait, the options are A to J, each a single proposition.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because it directly follows.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because it's a direct consequence.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to make a table of possible scenarios.

Scenario 1: Let's assume E is true.

From premise 1: E → ~F. If E is true, then F is false.

From premise 3: H ∨ ~E. Since E is true, ~E is false, so H must be true.

From premise 4: H → I. So, if H is true, then I is true.

But premise 5: ~I. So, I is false.

So, in this scenario, we have E is true, H is true, F is false, I is false.

So, this scenario is possible. So, this doesn't eliminate any options.

Scenario 2: Let's assume E is false.

From premise 1: E → ~F. If E is false, then ~E is true, so F must be false (because E → ~F is equivalent to ~E ∨ F).

So, F is false.

From premise 2: G → F. So, if G is true, then F is true. But F is false, so G must be false.

So, G is false.

From premise 3: H ∨ ~E. Since E is false, ~E is true, so H ∨ true is true. So, H can be true or false.

From premise 4: H → I. So, if H is true, then I must be true.

From premise 5: ~I. So, I is false.

So, if H is true, then I must be true, but I is false. So, H must be false.

So, in this scenario, H is false.

So, this scenario is possible. So, this doesn't eliminate any options.

So, in both scenarios, the premises are possible. So, that doesn't help us determine which options are consequences.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because ~H is a conclusion, and that's one of the options.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is C and E. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, because ~H is a straightforward conclusion. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should stick with E being correct. So, the answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: ~H**. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Premise 4**: H → I
2. **Premise 5**: ~I
3. From premises 4 and 5, using contrapositive: H → ~I
4. Therefore, H → ~I is a valid conclusion.
5. From the disjunction H ∨ ~E in premise 3:
   - If H is true, then ~E must be true (H → ~E).
   - If H is false, then ~E is true, making the disjunction true.
6. Since H → ~E is a valid conclusion, and we have ~H as a consequence from the premises:
   - If H is true, then I must be true (H → I), which contradicts ~I.
   - Therefore, H must be false, leading to ~H.

Thus, the immediate consequence is **E: ~H**.

Answer: E
