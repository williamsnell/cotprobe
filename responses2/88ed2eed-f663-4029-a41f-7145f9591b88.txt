Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So the problem says that there's a gas sample which is a mixture of ethane and butane. The bulb has a volume of 230 cm³, filled with this gas at a pressure of 97.5 x 10³ Pascals, and the temperature is 23.1 degrees Celsius. The mass of the gas is 0.3554 grams. They want the mole percent of butane in the mixture.

Hmm, mole percent. Right, mole percent is the percentage of a particular component by moles in the mixture. So I think I need to find out how many moles of ethane and butane are present and then find the mole fraction of butane.

First, I remember that when dealing with gases under specific conditions, the ideal gas law is useful. The formula is PV = nRT. So I can find the total moles of gas, then the moles of each component (assuming ideal behavior, which I think the question implies since it's a gas sample).

Let me jot down the given data:

Volume (V) = 230.0 cm³. Oh wait, I should convert that to liters because the units for R are usually in L·atm/(mol·K) or similar. So 230 cm³ is 0.23 liters.

Pressure (P) = 97.5 x 10³ Pascals. Wait, what's the value of R? Oh right, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using pressure in atm. But wait, the pressure here is in Pascals. I need to convert that to atm. Alternatively, I can convert volume to liters and pressure to atm, then use R.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Convert the pressure from Pascals to atm.
2. Convert the volume from cm³ to liters.
3. Use the ideal gas law to find the total moles (n_total = PV/(RT)).
4. Now, set up the equations for the moles of each gas.
5. Find the mole fractions of each gas.
6. Calculate the mole percent of butane.

Wait, but wait. How do I know the mole fractions without knowing the pressures or volumes? Oh wait, but the total pressure is given, and I think it's assumed that the mixture behaves ideally. So the sum of the partial pressures equals the total pressure (Dalton's Law). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, since the gas is a mixture, the ideal gas equation will apply to the total pressure. So the total moles are n_total = (P_total * V) / (R * T).

But wait, I also know the total mass of the gas. Because the mass is given as 0.3554 grams. So I can find the total moles, and then find the moles of each component.

Wait, but without knowing the ratio of ethane to butane, I can't directly find the moles of each. Oh, but perhaps the problem assumes that the molar masses are known, and so I can relate the masses of each component to their moles.

Wait, the molar masses: ethane (C2H6) has a molar mass of (2*12.01) + (6*1.008) = 24.02 + 6.048 = 30.068 g/mol. Butane (C4H10) is (4*12.01) + (10*1.008) = 48.04 + 10.08 = 58.12 g/mol.

So each mole of ethane contributes 30.068 grams, butane 58.12 grams.

So let me denote n_e (ethane moles) and n_b (butane moles). Then, the total mass is 0.3554 g:

30.068 * n_e + 58.12 * n_b = 0.3554.

And from the ideal gas law, the total moles are n_total = n_e + n_b.

So I have two equations:

1. 30.068 n_e + 58.12 n_b = 0.3554 g.

2. n_e + n_b = n_total.

But I don't know n_total yet. So perhaps I need to find n_total using the ideal gas law and then relate the two equations.

Wait, let me first compute the n_total.

Using the ideal gas law:

PV = nRT.

But wait, the units for R are in L·atm/(mol·K). So I need to convert P to atm. Let's calculate that.

1 atm = 101325 Pascals. So 97500 Pa is equal to 97500 / 101325 atm.

Let me compute that:

97500 / 101325 ≈ 0.962 atm.

Wait, let me compute it accurately:

101325 = approx 1.01325e5.

97500 / 101325 = ?

Divide numerator and denominator by 75: 97500 ÷75 = 1300, 101325 ÷75 = 1351.

So 1300 / 1351 ≈ 0.962 (since 1351 * 0.962 ≈ 1300).

So P ≈ 0.962 atm.

The temperature is 23.1 degrees Celsius, which needs to be converted to Kelvin: 23.1 + 273.15 = 296.25 K.

Now, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So n_total = (P V) / (R T).

Plug in the numbers:

P V = 0.962 atm * 0.23 L ≈ 0.962 * 0.23 = 0.2213 L·atm.

R T = 0.0821 * 296.25 ≈ 0.0821 * 296.25.

Let me calculate 0.08 * 296.25 = 23.7.

0.0021 * 296.25 = about 0.6221.

So total ≈ 23.7 + 0.6221 ≈ 24.3221.

So R T ≈ 24.3221 L·atm/(mol).

So n_total ≈ (0.2213) / (24.3221) ≈ approximately 0.009098 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.2213 divided by 24.3221.

24 * 0.009 is 0.216. 0.2213 - 0.216 = 0.0053. 0.0053 / 24.3221 ≈ 0.000218.

So n_total ≈ 0.009 + 0.000218 = 0.009218 mol.

Wait, but that seems low. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 0.962 * 0.23 = ?

0.962 * 0.2 is 0.1924; 0.962 *0.03=0.02886. Sum is 0.1924 + 0.02886 = 0.22126.

So n_total = 0.22126 / (0.0821 * 296.25).

Compute denominator: 0.0821 * 296.25.

Let me calculate 0.08 * 296.25=23.7, and 0.0021 * 296.25=6.22125.

So 23.7 +6.22125=29.92125.

Wait, wait, no. Because 0.0821 is 0.08 + 0.0021, so 0.0821 * 296.25 is 0.08 *296.25 =23.7, and 0.0021 *296.25=6.22125.

So 23.7 +6.22125=29.92125.

So n_total = 0.22126 / 29.92125 = approximately 0.007066 mol.

Wait, that's a more precise calculation.

Wait, 22.126 is 0.22126, and 29.92125 is the denominator.

So 0.22126 / 29.92125 = approximately 0.007067 mol.

Hmm, but wait, that would mean n_total is about 0.007067 moles.

Wait, that's about 0.00707 moles.

Wait, now, but this is just the total. But the question is about the mole percent of butane. So perhaps I can use that to find moles of each.

But wait, I also have the equation 30.068 n_e +58.12 n_b=0.3554 grams.

So I have two equations:

Equation 1: 30.068 n_e +58.12 n_b= 0.3554 g.

Equation 2: n_e +n_b = 0.007067 mol.

Let me try to solve these two equations.

Let me express n_e = 0.007067 -n_b.

Substitute into equation 1:

30.068 (0.007067 -n_b) +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Compute 30.068 *0.007067:

30.068 * 0.007 is 0.210476, 30.068 *0.000067≈ 0.002015. Total ≈ 0.2125.

So 30.068 *0.007067 ≈0.2125.

So equation becomes:

0.2125 -30.068 n_b +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Combine like terms:

0.2125 + (58.12 -30.068) n_b =0.3554.

58.12 -30.068=28.052.

So equation: 0.2125 +28.052 n_b = 0.3554.

Subtract 0.2125 from both sides:

28.052 n_b = 0.3554 -0.2125 = 0.1429.

So n_b = 0.1429 /28.052 ≈ 0.005094 mol.

Wait, that's about 0.005094 moles of butane.

Then n_e = 0.007067 -0.005094 = 0.001973 mol.

So n_e ≈0.001973 mol, n_b≈0.005094 mol.

Now, the mole percent of butane is (n_b /n_total) *100%.

n_total is 0.007067 mol.

So mole percent= (0.005094 /0.007067 ) *100%.

Calculate 0.005094 /0.007067 ≈ 0.7217.

So 72.17% is the mole percent of butane.

Wait, but the options don't have 72%. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:70%, B:27%, C:50%, D:10%, E:60%, F:15%, G:25%, H:32%, I:45%, J:38%.

Hmm, 72% isn't an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation of n_total. Let me recheck that.

Wait, let me recalculate n_total.

P = 97.5e3 Pa = 97500 Pa.

Convert to atm: 97500 /101325 = approximately 0.962 atm.

V = 0.23 L.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T=23.1 +273.15=296.25 K.

n_total = (P V)/(R T) → (0.962 *0.23) / (0.0821 *296.25).

Compute numerator: 0.962 *0.23 = 0.22126.

Denominator: 0.0821 * 296.25 = ?

0.08 *296=23.68; 0.0021 *296=0.6216.

So 23.68 +0.6216=24.3016.

n_total = 0.22126 /24.3016 ≈ 0.009129 mol.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 0.007067, but now it's 0.009129.

Wait, which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.0821 *296.25.

Compute 296.25 * 0.0821.

Compute:

296 *0.0821 = let's compute 296 *0.08=23.68; 296 *0.0021=0.6216 → 23.68+0.6216=24.3016.

0.25 *0.0821 =0.020525.

So total denominator is 24.3016 +0.020525=24.322125.

So denominator is 24.322125.

Numerator: 0.962 *0.23 =0.22126.

So n_total =0.22126 /24.322125 = let's calculate this.

24.322125 * 0.009=0.2189.

0.22126 -0.2189 =0.00236.

0.00236 /24.322125 ≈0.000097.

So n_total≈0.009097 mol.

So approximately 0.009097 mol.

So n_total is about 0.009097 mol.

Then, the mole percent of butane is (0.005094 /0.009097) *100%.

Compute 0.005094 /0.009097 = approximately 0.56.

Wait, 0.005094 divided by 0.009097.

Let me compute 0.005094 /0.009097.

Hmm, 0.005094 / 0.009097 ≈ 0.56 (since 9.097e-3 *0.56= approx 5.09e-3, which is 0.005094).

So 0.56 *100% is 56% mole percent.

Wait, but the options don't have 56%. The closest option is G:25%, H:32%, F:15%, J:38%.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate the n_b.

n_e +n_b =0.009097.

30.068 n_e +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Substituting n_e =0.009097 -n_b into the equation:

30.068*(0.009097 -n_b) +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Expanding:

30.068 *0.009097 -30.068 n_b +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Compute 30.068 *0.009097.

0.009097 *30 =0.27291.

0.009097 *0.068=approx 0.000619.

So 30.068 *0.009097≈0.27291 +0.000619=0.27353.

So the equation becomes: 0.27353 -30.068 n_b +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Combine like terms: (-30.068 +58.12 )n_b +0.27353 =0.3554.

58.12 -30.068 = 28.052.

So 28.052 n_b = 0.3554 -0.27353 =0.08187.

So n_b = 0.08187 /28.052 ≈0.00292 mol.

Wait, so the mole percent of butane is (0.00292 /0.009097)*100% → approximately 32.1%.

Hmm, so 32% is option H.

Wait, earlier I thought the mole percent was 56% but that's when I made a calculation error.

Wait, but now I'm getting 32% with correct calculations. Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, let me redo the calculation for n_b.

n_e +n_b =0.009097.

30.068 n_e +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Express n_e=0.009097 -n_b.

Plug into equation:

30.068*(0.009097 -n_b) +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Multiply through:

30.068 *0.009097 =0.27353.

30.068*(-n_b) = -30.068 n_b.

+58.12 n_b.

So equation: 0.27353 -30.068 n_b +58.12 n_b =0.3554.

Combine terms: (-30.068 +58.12) n_b =0.08187.

So 28.052 n_b =0.08187.

n_b= 0.08187 /28.052 → 0.00292 mol.

So mole percent = (0.00292 /0.009097)*100% = (0.321) → 32.1%.

Which is option H:32%.

Okay, so that's the correct answer. So the mole percent of butane is approximately 32%, which is option H.
</think>

To determine the mole percent of butane in the gas mixture, we use the ideal gas law and the given data:

### Step 1: Convert Units and Calculate Total Moles
The given data includes:
- Pressure: \( P = 97.5 \, \text{kPa} = 97500 \, \text{Pa} \)
- Volume: \( V = 230 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.23 \, \text{L} \)
- Temperature: \( T = 23.1^\circ \text{C} = 296.25 \, \text{K} \)
- Gas constant: \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

First, convert pressure to atm:
\[
P = \frac{97500}{101325} \approx 0.962 \, \text{atm}
\]

Now, calculate the total moles of gas using the ideal gas law:
\[
n_{\text{total}} = \frac{P V}{R T} = \frac{(0.962)(0.23)}{(0.0821)(296.25)}
\]

Compute the numerator:
\[
P V = 0.962 \times 0.23 = 0.22126 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

Compute the denominator:
\[
R T = 0.0821 \times 296.25 \approx 24.3221 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}
\]

Thus:
\[
n_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.22126}{24.3221} \approx 0.009097 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for Moles of Ethane and Butane
The total moles of gas is:
\[
n_{\text{total}} = n_{\text{ethane}} + n_{\text{butane}}
\]

The mass of the gas is given as:
\[
m = 0.3554 \, \text{g}
\]

Using the molar masses of ethane (\( M_{\text{ethane}} = 30.068 \, \text{g/mol} \)) and butane (\( M_{\text{butane}} = 58.12 \, \text{g/mol} \)), the mass equation is:
\[
m = n_{\text{ethane}} \times 30.068 + n_{\text{butane}} \times 58.12
\]

Substitute \( n_{\text{ethane}} = n_{\text{total}} - n_{\text{butane}} \) into the mass equation:
\[
0.3554 = (n_{\text{total}} - n_{\text{butane}}) \times 30.068 + n_{\text{butane}} \times 58.12
\]

Simplify:
\[
0.3554 = n_{\text{total}} \times 30.068 - n_{\text{butane}} \times 30.068 + n_{\text{butane}} \times 58.12
\]
\[
0.3554 = n_{\text{total}} \times 30.068 + n_{\text{butane}} \times (58.12 - 30.068)
\]
\[
0.3554 = n_{\text{total}} \times 30.068 + n_{\text{butane}} \times 28.052
\]

Substitute \( n_{\text{total}} = 0.009097 \, \text{mol} \):
\[
0.3554 = (0.009097 \times 30.068) + (n_{\text{butane}} \times 28.052)
\]
\[
0.3554 = 0.27353 + (n_{\text{butane}} \times 28.052)
\]
\[
n_{\text{butane}} \times 28.052 = 0.3554 - 0.27353 = 0.08187
\]
\[
n_{\text{butane}} = \frac{0.08187}{28.052} \approx 0.00292 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Mole Percent of Butane
The mole percent of butane is:
\[
\text{Mole \% of butane} = \frac{n_{\text{butane}}}{n_{\text{total}}} \times 100\% = \frac{0.00292}{0.009097} \times 100\% \approx 32.1\%
\]

### Final Answer
The mole percent of butane is approximately **32%**, which corresponds to option **H**.

ANSWER: H
