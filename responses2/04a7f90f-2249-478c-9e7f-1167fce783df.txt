Question:

A tomato cannery has 5000 pounds of grade A tomatoes and 10,000 pounds of grade B tomatoes, from which they will, make whole canned tomatoes and tomato paste. Whole tomatoes must be composed of at least 80 percent grade A tomatoes, whereas tomato paste must be made with at least 10 percent grade A tomatoes. Whole tomatoes sell for $0.08 per pound and paste sells for $0.05 per pound. Formulate a linear program to solve for how much of each product to make, if the company wants to maximize revenue. (Hint: Let x_WA = pounds of A grade tomatoes used in whole tomatoes, x_WB = pounds of B grade tomatoes used in whole tomatoes; the amount of whole tomatoes produced can be found as x_WA + x_WB after x_WA and x_WB are chosen.)

Options:

A: the revenue is $.10 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.05 (X_PA + X_PB)
B: the revenue is $.05 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.08 (X_PA + X_PB)
C: the revenue is $.08 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.10 (X_PA + X_PB)
D: the revenue is $.08 (X_PA + X_PB) + $.05 (X_WA + X_WB)
E: the revenue is $.08 (X_WA) + $.05 (X_WB) + $.05 (X_PA) + $.05 (X_PB)
F: the revenue is $.07 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.04 (X_PA + X_PB)
G: the revenue is $.08 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.05 (X_PA + X_PB)
H: the revenue is $.08 (X_WA) + $.05 (X_PB)
I: the revenue is $.08 (5000 - X_WA) + $.05 (10000 - X_PB)
J: the revenue is $.09 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.06 (X_PA + X_PB)

Okay, so I have this linear programming problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what's given.

The problem is about a tomato cannery that makes whole tomatoes and tomato paste. They have 5000 pounds of grade A tomatoes and 10,000 pounds of grade B tomatoes. They want to make whole tomatoes and tomato paste, with specific requirements on the percentage of A tomatoes in each product. The goal is to maximize revenue.

Let me break down the given information:

- Whole tomatoes (WT) must be at least 80% grade A. So, in whole tomatoes, >= 80% A.
- Tomato paste (TP) must be at least 10% grade A. So, TP >= 10% A.
- Whole tomatoes sell for $0.08 per pound.
- Tomato paste sells for $0.05 per pound.

They have 5000 pounds of grade A and 10,000 pounds of grade B. The question is to formulate a linear program to maximize revenue. The options are given in multiple-choice letters, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

The hint suggests that the amount of whole tomatoes produced is x_WA + x_WB, where x_WA is the pounds of A grade in whole tomatoes, and x_WB is the pounds of B grade in whole tomatoes. So, x_WA and x_WB are the variables for whole tomatoes. Then, the same goes for the pastes: they probably have variables like x_PA and x_PB for whole and paste respectively.

So, the total whole tomatoes made would be x_WA + x_WB, and the total paste would be x_PA + x_PB.

Now, the revenue. Revenue is the amount of money made from selling each product. So, revenue from whole tomatoes would be the price per pound times the pounds sold. Similarly for pastes.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how much whole tomatoes and pastes are being made, just that they're composed of parts of A and B. So, the variables are for the amounts used in WT and TP.

So, for whole tomatoes, the revenue would be 0.08*(x_WA + x_WB), and for pastes, it's 0.05*(x_PA + x_PB).

Wait, but the options don't all show that. Let me look at each option.

Option A: Revenue is 0.10*(x_WA + x_WB) + 0.05*(x_PA + x_PB). Hmm, that would mean whole tomatoes sell for $0.10 and pastes for $0.05, which doesn't match the given per pound prices. So, this seems wrong. Because the per pound price of whole tomatoes is 0.08, not 0.10.

Option B: Revenue is 0.05*(x_WA + x_WB) + 0.08*(x_PA + x_PB). That would mean whole tomatoes sell for 5 cents and pastes for 8 cents. Again, the per pound prices are 8 and 5 cents, so this would be wrong. Wait, no, the problem states that WT sells for $0.08 and TP for $0.05. So if the revenue is 0.05*(WT) + 0.08*(TP), that would be the case. So B seems correct, but I need to check all options.

Wait, wait. Let me read the problem again. The revenue is made by selling the products. So, for each whole tomato made, it's 0.08 per pound. For each paste, 0.05 per pound. So the revenue from whole tomatoes is 0.08*(x_WA + x_WB), and from pastes, 0.05*(x_PA + x_PB). So the total revenue is the sum of these two.

So the total revenue would be 0.08*(x_WA + x_WB) + 0.05*(x_PA + x_PB). Looking at the options, which one matches this? Let me check each option:

Option C says revenue is 0.08 (x_WA + x_WB) + 0.10 (x_PA + x_PB). No, that's 10 cents for pastes, which is incorrect.

Option B says 0.05 (x_WA + x_WB) + 0.08 (x_PA + x_PB). So that's 5 cents for WT and 8 for TP. But the problem states WT sells for 8 cents, so B is wrong.

Option D: 0.08 (x_PA + x_PB) + 0.05 (x_WA + x_WB). So same as B, but reversed. So that's same as B, but the terms are switched. So it's incorrect, because the revenue from WT is 0.08 and from TP is 0.05.

Option E: 0.08 (x_WA) + 0.05 (x_WB) + 0.05 (x_PA) + 0.05 (x_PB). So this is treating whole tomatoes and pastes as separate products, each selling at their own price. But that's not correct because the revenue comes from each product as a whole, not individual. So E is incorrect.

Option J: Revenue is 0.08 (x_WA + x_WB) + 0.05 (x_PB). Hmm, this is strange. Why is x_PB not included? Because x_PB is part of the pastes. So this suggests that the revenue is based on x_WA and x_WB, and then x_PB is treated as a separate product with only 5 cents. But that's incorrect because pastes include both x_PA and x_PB. So this would only account for one part of the pastes, so J is wrong.

Option A: Revenue is 0.10 (WT) + 0.05 (PT). So WT is 10 cents and PT 5, which is incorrect.

Option F: Revenue is 0.07 (WT) + 0.04 (PT). That's way too low. Whole tomatoes at 7 cents each would be way cheaper, and pastes at 4 cents each, which doesn't match the problem's stated prices.

Option G: Revenue is 0.08 (WT) + 0.05 (PT). So that's 8 cents for WT and 5 cents for PT. But the problem states that whole tomatoes are $0.08 and pastes are $0.05, so the revenue should be 0.08*(WT) + 0.05*(PT). So G is correct in the terms of the multipliers, but the variables are WT and PT. Wait, no, in option G, the revenue is 0.08*(x_WA + x_WB) + 0.05*(x_PA + x_PB). So that's same as what I derived earlier. So G is correct in the revenue terms, but the variables x_WA and x_WB are for whole tomatoes, so perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the way the revenue is expressed in G is 0.08*(x_WA + x_WB) + 0.05*(x_PA + x_PB). That's exactly what I thought was correct. So G seems to be correct. But let me check the other options for any possible mistakes.

Option H: 0.08 (x_WA) + 0.05 (x_PB). So only x_WA is for WT, and x_PB is for pastes. But that would leave out x_WB and x_PA. So that's incorrect because the formulation should include all products. So H is wrong.

Option I: 0.08*(5000 - x_WA) + 0.05*(10000 - x_PB). Hmm, wait. 5000 is the total A grade, so x_WA can't exceed that, but this option seems to subtract x_WA from 5000, which would represent the amount of A grade not used in WT. But why would that be a variable? I'm not sure. It seems like this is treating the other grades (B) as a separate consideration, which isn't correct. So I think I is wrong.

So, the correct formulation is revenue = 0.08*(x_WA + x_WB) + 0.05*(x_PA + x_PB). Looking at the options, G matches that. So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

The correct linear program formulation to maximize revenue is to consider the revenue from both whole tomatoes and tomato pastes, using the given per-pound prices and constraints.

The revenue is calculated by multiplying the price per pound by the pounds sold. Whole tomatoes sell for $0.08 per pound, and pastes sell for $0.05 per pound. The total revenue is the sum of revenue from whole tomatoes and pastes.

The variables are:
- \( x_{WA} \): pounds of A grade used in whole tomatoes.
- \( x_{WB} \): pounds of B grade used in whole tomatoes.
- \( x_{PA} \): pounds of A grade used in pastes.
- \( x_{PB} \): pounds of B grade used in pastes.

The total revenue is:
\[
\text{Revenue} = 0.08(x_{WA} + x_{WB}) + 0.05(x_{PA} + x_{PB})
\]

Looking at the options, option G matches this formulation:
G: the revenue is \( 0.08(x_{WA} + x_{WB}) + 0.05(x_{PA} + x_{PB}) \).
