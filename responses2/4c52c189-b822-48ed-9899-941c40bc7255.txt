Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about safety hazards when heating substances in a school lab. Let me try to figure this out. Hmm, the question asks which option poses the greatest safety risk.

First, I'll read through the options carefully. There are several chemicals listed: MgSO4, KI, NaHCO3, Mercury(II) oxide, CuSO4 hydrate, Zn(NO3)2, Cu(NO3)2, NaCl, Al powder, and a mixture of Fe and S. 

I remember that when heating certain substances, they can release toxic fumes or cause chemical reactions that can be dangerous. So I'll need to think about each substance and what happens when they're heated.

Starting with A: Magnesium sulfate. I think magnesium sulfate is anhydrous, but maybe it can form a sulfate salt when heated. Wait, magnesium sulfate is usually used in dry labs and shouldn't be heated because it doesn't decompose. So no immediate danger here.

B: Potassium iodide. KI is a common reagent. If you heat KI, it might decompose, especially if it's in anhydrous form. I remember that KI is a strong oxidizing agent, so heating it could produce I2, which is dangerous. Oh, that's a big risk.

C: Sodium bicarbonate. This is common in labs, used for things like baking soda. Sodium bicarbonate is reactive and can cause fumes if not handled properly. It can release CO2 and NaHCO3, which can be harmful if inhaled or in large amounts. Also, it's a base, so in the air, it can react with CO2 to produce CO2 and NaOH, which is a strong base.

D: Mercury(II) oxide. I know that mercury compounds are toxic and can form strong acids. Mercury(II) oxide (HgO) reacts with water to form Hg2(OH)2, which is a very strong and toxic solution. So heating HgO would release Hg(OH)2 water, which is dangerous.

E: Copper(II) sulfate hydrate. Copper sulfate is a common component in labs, used in things like copper sulfate solutions. If it's in anhydrous form, it doesn't decompose easily. However, if it's heated, it might release SO4^2- ions, which can cause burns or other effects. But I'm not sure if that's more dangerous than other options.

F: Zinc nitrate. Zinc nitrate is a salt used in many experiments. If it's heated, especially in a lab, it can release NO, which is nitrogen monoxide, which is toxic. But I'm not as familiar with how it behaves in different states.

G: Copper(II) nitrate. Similar to option E, but nitrate is a larger ion. Heating might release NO3^- ions, possibly causing burns or fumes. But I'm not certain if that's more dangerous than mercury.

H: Sodium chloride. Sodium chloride is a common table salt. It's anhydrous and stable, so heating it shouldn't cause immediate harm. It's used in many reactions, but it doesn't decompose easily.

I: Aluminum powder. Aluminum reacts violently with water, especially concentrated solutions. Heating aluminum powder in water can lead to burns, fumes, and a toxic gas like hydrogen. So that's a significant risk.

J: A mixture of Fe and S. Iron(II) sulfide is a metal sulfide. It's reactive and can react with O2 to form Fe3O4, which is a black pigment and toxic. So if the mixture is heated, it could release Fe3O4, which is a serious fire hazard.

Wait, so the options are about which poses the greatest safety risk. Let's evaluate each.

Option I: Aluminum powder in water. When heated, it reacts violently, causing a fire. That's a very dangerous reaction. The heat would cause rapid oxidation, leading to a toxic gas and immediate burns, which is life-threatening.

Option J: FeS. Heating FeS in oxygen produces Fe3O4, which is a black pigment and dangerous. So that's another fire hazard.

Option D: HgO. It's a strong acid and a toxic solution. So heating HgO in water would release Hg(OH)2, which is dangerous.

Option B: KI. Heating KI can produce I2, which is a brown liquid and can cause burns, but it's not as dangerous as the other solutions.

Option E: Copper sulfate hydrate. If heated, it might release water, causing burns or fumes. But I'm not sure if it's more dangerous than Mercury(II) oxide or Aluminum.

Option H: Sodium chloride. It's stable and won't decompose easily. So heating it won't cause a fire.

So which of these is the greatest risk? Aluminum powder seems to be the most dangerous. When heated, it reacts violently with water, leading to a red hot Al, which burns with a smell of rotten eggs, and releases toxic gases. The heat is so intense that it can cause a fire, which is extremely dangerous.

Option I: Aluminum in water is definitely a fire hazard. Similarly, option J's reaction produces a black pigment and a fire, which is worse. But between I and J, I think option I is more dangerous because Al in water is a classic fire hazard. For instance, I remember hearing about the "Al in water" experiment where Al powder reacts with water and releases toxic fumes and a toxic gas.

Wait, but what about the other options. Mercury(II) oxide (D) is a strong acid that can cause severe burns and fumes. Aluminum (I) is also a strong fire hazard. So which is worse?

Mercury(II) oxide is a strong acid, and when it's heated, it can produce Hg(OH)2, which is toxic and can cause burns. But the reaction is more of a chemical reaction leading to a toxic solution rather than a direct fire. On the other hand, heating aluminum in water leads to a fire, which is more immediate and dangerous.

I think the question is asking for the greatest safety risk. I should consider the immediate and severe effects. For example, mixing iron and sulfur (option J) would produce a black pigment, but is that more dangerous than the other options? Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the last character of the answer. Let me look at the options again.

The options are A to J, and the user asks to select the answer with the last letter. So when I'm choosing, I'll pick the correct answer letter, then take the last letter.

So the options are about which poses the greatest risk. The correct answer is option I, Aluminum powder. Because heating Aluminum powder in water leads to a red hot Al, which burns and produces toxic fumes. That's a fire hazard, which is a very dangerous condition.

So the correct answer is I. So the letter is I. But wait, the question lists the options as A to J, and the letters are single letters. The last character of the answer must be the letter chosen.

Wait, no, the question says "which of the following poses the greatest safety risk", and the options are A to J, each with a chemical. I need to pick the letter, and then take the last letter of that answer. But the question is about the answer being a letter, and the last character is the letter.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following poses the greatest safety risk while being heated in a school laboratory?" So the options are A to J, each a chemical. The correct answer is I, so the letter is I, and I need to select I as the correct option. Then the answer is I, so the last letter is I.

Wait, but the user says "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer is I, and I should write that letter as the last character.

Wait, noâ€”the question is asking which option is the correct answer. The options are A to J, each with a chemical. The correct answer is I. So the letter I is the correct choice. The last character of the answer is I.

Wait, but the user said, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the instruction again.

The user wrote: "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer is a letter, and the last character of your response (i.e., the letter) must be the chosen letter.

But I'm supposed to pick the correct answer, which is I, so the letter is I, and the last character is I.

So the correct option is I, and the answer is I. So the letter I is the correct one.

The question asks which chemical poses the greatest safety risk when heated in a school laboratory. Upon analysis, heating Aluminum powder (option I) in water leads to a red hot Aluminum oxide, which burns with a smell of rotten eggs and releases toxic fumes. This is a classic fire hazard, making it the most dangerous option. Therefore, the correct answer is I.

ANSWER: I
