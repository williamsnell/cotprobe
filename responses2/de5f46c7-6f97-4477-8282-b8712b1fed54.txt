Question:

A 20-year-old student at a state university enrolled in the university's R. O. T. C (Reserve Officers' Training Corps. ) program. As part of her R. O. T. C. training, the student was required to spend three weeks at a camp for Marine Corps. summer field exercises. While at the camp, the student was given a new synthetic helmet to wear during her basic training. An agency purchased the new high-technology helmets for the Army and Marine Corps. to replace the old "steel pot" headgear worn for decades by U. S. soldiers. These new synthetic helmets were manufactured by a corporation and were made of Kevlar, an extremely tough fiber material with high energy-absorbing qualities that made it stronger in some ways than steel. When the student received her helmet from the Marine Corps. , it was packaged in the original carton supplied by the corporation. On the box, there was a picture that depicted an off-duty marine wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle. One afternoon after training, the student decided to take a ride on her bicycle. Believing that it could be used as a bicycle helmet, the student decided to use it for that purpose. During the ride, the student hit a deep pothole that caused her to be thrown headfirst from the bicycle. As she was flying through the air, the strap from her helmet came loose, and the helmet fell off her head. The student landed on a lawn and was temporarily knocked unconscious. She suffered serious head injuries. If the student asserts a claim against the corporation to recover damages for her injuries, she will most likely

Options:

A: not prevail, because the student failed to secure the helmet strap properly.
B: prevail, because the corporation was negligent in their depiction of the helmet's use.
C: prevail, because the corporation failed to test the helmet for use in non-combat situations.
D: prevail, because under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur negligence can be inferred from the fact that the helmet came off the student's head.
E: prevail, because the original package depicted a picture of a cyclist wearing the helmet.
F: prevail, because the corporation should have provided a warning against using the helmet for non-military purposes.
G: not prevail, because the student assumed the risk by choosing to use the helmet while cycling.
H: not prevail, because the helmet had been properly designed by the corporation for its intended use by the Army and Marine Corps.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a 20-year-old student who bought a synthetic helmet for her basic training. The helmet was made of Kevlar, which is known for being tough and energy-absorbing. She used it as a helmet for a bicycle ride, hit a pothole, and fell off.

The question is about the student's claim to recover damages against the corporation that made the helmet. The options are about whether the corporation can recover, and why.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that in product liability cases, courts look for negligence. So I need to check if the corporation's design or the way they used the helmet was negligent.

The facts: the original packaging showed an off-duty marine on the helmet while riding a bicycle. So the design was for military purposes, perhaps? Or maybe it's for personal use? I'm not sure. But the key point is whether the helmet was designed for military use or if it's meant for other purposes.

Wait, Kevlar is used for various applications, so maybe it's meant for non-military use. But the original packaging (from the Marine Corps) might have shown its intended use. But the student used it for cycling, so if it's not intended for that, the design might be considered defective.

So the question is, was the design of the helmet defective? If the design was for military use, but the helmet was used for personal use, then the design could be considered defective. Alternatively, maybe the packaging didn't inform about the non-military use, so the design was defective.

Another angle: if the helmet was properly designed for military use, the student's use as a helmet shouldn't have been defective. But if the design wasn't properly designed for personal use, then the use was defective.

Wait, but the question is about whether the student assumed the risk by choosing to use the helmet for cycling. So the student thought it was a helmet. If the design was intended for military use, then using it for personal use would be a breach of design. But if the design was for personal use, then the student didn't have a duty to use it.

Alternatively, maybe the design was intended for military use, but the student's use was for personal purposes, which might not have been a breach. But if the design wasn't specified, then perhaps the company didn't warn, leading to a design defect.

Wait, the question says the original packaging depicted an off-duty marine on the helmet while riding a bicycle. So maybe the design was for personal use, and thus the student's use was acceptable. But if the design was intended for a specific purpose, like military, then using it for personal use would be a defect.

But the answer options suggest looking at specific defenses. For example, option D says the student assumed the risk by choosing to use it. Option H says the helmet was properly designed for its intended use.

So if the design of the helmet was not properly designed for personal use, then the student's assumption of risk is incorrect. But if the design was intended for other purposes, like military, then the student didn't have a duty to use it.

The key issue is whether the design was defective. If the design was for another purpose, perhaps the student shouldn't have been using it. But if the design wasn't properly designed for personal use, then the company might be liable.

Looking at the options, which one supports the student's claim? Option D says the student assumed the risk, meaning the helmet was not defective. Option H says the design was proper. But if the design was intended for military purposes, the student shouldn't have had a duty to use it for personal purposes.

But the question is whether the student can recover. So, if the design was not properly designed for personal use, then the helmet was defective. So the company is likely liable because the design was defective. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, if the design was intended for military use, then using it for personal use shouldn't be a breach. So perhaps the design was defective because it's not intended for personal use.

Wait, but the question is about whether the student's use was negligent. So perhaps the company's design wasn't intended for personal use, leading to a design defect. So the student's use was defective, leading to the helmet falling off.

But the options here are about whether the corporation can recover. So the student's claim is that the helmet fell off because of negligence. So if the design was defective, then the student's use was negligent, and the company should be liable.

Looking at the answer options, option C says the corporation failed to test the helmet for use in non-combat situations. That would mean the helmet was defective because it didn't work as intended in other contexts. So the design was defective, and the helmet fell off because of that.

So, the correct answer would be that the company failed to test the helmet for use in non-combat situations, which would be option C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: if the original packaging showed the helmet in a military context, then the design might have been intended for that. But the student used it for personal use. If the design wasn't intended for personal use, then the student's use was negligent. So the company is liable because they didn't test the helmet for use in other situations.

Alternatively, if the design was intended for military use, then the student's assumption of risk is incorrect, so the company isn't liable. But the question is whether the student can assert a claim. So if the design was intended for military use, the student didn't have a duty to use it for personal use, and thus the design was not defective. So the company isn't liable.

But the facts don't specify that the design was intended for military use. It just says it was a synthetic helmet for Marine Corps training. So perhaps the design was intended for personal use, but the student's use was incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the design was intended for another purpose entirely, but the student's use was incorrect.

Wait, but the key is whether the design was defective. If the design was not properly designed for personal use, then the student's use was negligent.

So looking at the options, option C is about the company failing to test the helmet for non-combat use. That would mean the design is defective, leading to the helmet falling off. So the student's claim would be valid.

Alternatively, option G says the helmet was properly designed, so no defect. But perhaps the design wasn't designed for personal use, so the student's use was a breach.

But option D says the student assumed the risk by choosing to use it. If the design was intended for personal use, then the student didn't have a duty to use it, so the design wasn't defective. Therefore, the company isn't liable. So the student's claim would not prevail.

But the options are about the student's claim, so if the design was intended for personal use, the student didn't have a duty. But the question is whether the student can recover. So, if the design was not intended for personal use, then the student's assumption of risk is incorrect, leading to a breach.

Wait, but the facts don't specify that the design was intended for personal use. It just says it was for Marine Corps training. So perhaps the design wasn't intended for personal use, and thus the student was using it incorrectly. But the company's design might have included that.

Alternatively, maybe the design was intended for personal use, which the student didn't comply with, leading to the helmet falling off. But that depends on the design.

Alternatively, perhaps the Kevlar helmet was meant for military use, so the student's use was incorrect, leading to the helmet falling off. In that case, the company's design was defective, so they are liable.

But the options don't mention that. Option C says the company failed to test the helmet for non-combat. If the design wasn't tested, it's defective. So the helmet fell off because of that.

So the correct answer is either C or G or D.

Wait, another approach: the student's assumption of risk (option D) would mean that the helmet was not defective. But if the design was intended for personal use, then the student didn't have a duty to use it. So the design was not defective. Therefore, the student's claim would not prevail.

But the facts don't specify whether the design was intended for personal use. The problem is that the student used the helmet as a personal one, which might not have been the intended use.

But perhaps the design was intended for personal use, but the student's mistake in using it meant the helmet fell off. But the question is about the design's negligence.

Alternatively, maybe the design was intended for personal use, but the company's packaging didn't warn, so the student didn't know it was for personal use. That could lead to a design defect, which is why the company is liable.

Hmm. This is getting complicated.

Another angle: The fact that the student's use was a breach of design is a defense. So the defense would be that the design was defective because the company didn't test it for non-military use.

So the correct answer would be option C.

So, the answer is option C.
</think>

The scenario involves a 20-year-old student using a synthetic helmet as a personal one during cycling, which resulted in the helmet falling off her head. The question is whether the corporation can recover damages for her injuries based on negligence.

The key issue revolves around the design of the helmet. The original packaging depicted an off-duty marine wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle. If the design was intended for military use (as shown in the packaging), the student's use as a personal helmet would not constitute a breach of design. However, if the design was intended for personal use, the student's assumption of risk (option D) would not apply, and the design would likely be considered defective.

Option C suggests the company failed to test the helmet for use in non-combat situations, indicating a design defect. This would make the helmet unsuitable for personal use, leading to the helmet falling off. This defense supports the student's claim for damages.

Option D claims the student assumed the risk by choosing to use the helmet. This would not apply if the design was intended for personal use, as the student had no duty to use it. Therefore, the student's claim would not prevail.

Thus, the most likely answer is that the company failed to test the helmet for non-military use, making the helmet defective and liable for the student's injuries.
