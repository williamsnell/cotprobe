Okay, so I've got this integral to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because integrals can be tricky. Let me take a deep breath and think it through step by step. The integral is from 2 to 4 of [sqrt(log(9 - x)) divided by (sqrt(log(9 - x)) plus sqrt(log(x + 3)))] dx. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's some symmetry or substitution I can use here.

First, I should probably write the integral down to visualize it better. So, it's ∫ from 2 to 4 [√(log(9 - x)) / (√(log(9 - x)) + √(log(x + 3)))] dx. 

I remember that sometimes when you have an integral with limits a to b, and the integrand has a function f(x) and f(a + b - x), you can use a substitution like u = a + b - x to see if the integral simplifies. Maybe that's applicable here.

Let me try substituting t = 6 - x. Because when x is 2, t becomes 4, and when x is 4, t is 2. So the limits will swap, but since it's a definite integral, the negative sign will cancel out, so I can write it as ∫ from 4 to 2, which is the same as -∫ from 2 to 4. So, the integral becomes ∫ from 2 to 4 [√(log(9 - (6 - t))) / (√(log(9 - (6 - t))) + √(log((6 - t) + 3)))] dt, which simplifies.

Wait, let's compute each part. 9 - (6 - t) is 9 -6 + t, which is 3 + t. So the numerator inside the square root becomes sqrt(log(3 + t)). 

Then, the denominator: log( (6 - t) + 3 ) is log(9 - t). So denominator is sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t)).

So now the integral becomes ∫ from 2 to 4 [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t))) ] dt. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps yet. Let me call the original integral I. So I = ∫ from 2 to 4 [ sqrt(log(9 - x)) / (A + B) ] dx, where A = sqrt(log(9 -x)) and B = sqrt(log(x+3)). 

After substitution, I found that the integral becomes ∫ from 2 to 4 [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t))) ] dt. Let me call this integral I'. But notice that if I switch x and t, the integral is the same. Because when I substituted t =6 -x, the integral becomes I', and so I = I'. That suggests that I = I', but if I add them together, I + I' would be 2I, and each would be equal to the integral over the same limits, but perhaps there's a simplification.

Wait, actually, I is the original integral, and I' is the transformed integral which is similar but with (3 + t) inside. Wait, let me think again. 

Wait, both integrals are over the same interval, and the integrand in I is [sqrt(log(9 -x)) / (sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x+3)))].

And after substitution, I get that the integrand becomes [sqrt(log(x + 3)) / (sqrt(log(x+3)) + sqrt(log(9 -x)))] when x is replaced by t. So the integrand becomes sqrt(log(x+3)) / [sqrt(log(x+3)) + sqrt(log(9 -x))], right?

So I have I = ∫ [sqrt(log(9 -x)) / (A + B)] dx from 2 to4, and I' = ∫ [sqrt(log(x+3)) / (A + B)] dx from 2 to4.

If I add I and I', what do I get? I + I' = ∫ [sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x+3))] / (A + B) dx from 2 to4. But since A + B is the denominator, this simplifies to ∫1 dx from 2 to4, which is simply (4 -2) = 2.

So I + I' = 2. But since I = I', because the substitution t =6 -x leads to I' = I, then 2I = 2, so I =1. 

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't include 1. Let me double-check my steps. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go through it again.

Wait, I substituted t =6 -x, so when x=2, t=4, and x=4, t=2. So the integral becomes ∫ from 4 to2 [sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t))) ] dt. But dt is negative, so it's equal to ∫ from2 to4 [sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t))) ] dt. So that's I', which is the same as I, because I is ∫ from2 to4 [sqrt(log(9 -x)) / denominator] dx, and in the transformed integral, the denominator is the same as the original denominator, just swapping A and B. Wait, no, in the transformed integral, the denominator is sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t)), same as the original denominator. So the integrand is sqrt(log(3 +t)) divided by (sqrt(log(3 +t)) + sqrt(log(9-t)) ), which is the same as the original integrand, just replacing x with t. Since the variable of integration is a dummy variable, this is effectively the same as the original integrand. So I' = I. Therefore, I + I = 2I = ∫1 dx from 2 to4, which is 2. Therefore, 2I =2 → I=1. 

But none of the options are 1. Wait, the options are A:0.8, B:2.2, C:1.5, D:2.0, E:3.5, F:2.5, G:1.0, H:3.0, I:0.5, J:1.2.

Wait, so 1 is not an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should test with a substitution that makes the numerator and denominator symmetric. Let me try substitution x = 3 + t, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps there's a property where the integral from a to b of f(x) dx equals the integral of f(a + b -x) dx. That's a common trick.

Wait, when I made the substitution t =6 -x, and the integrand became [sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 -t)))], but wait, the denominator was sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t)) because log(9 -x) becomes log(3 + t) when x =6 - t. Wait, no, earlier when I substituted, I had x =6 -t, so 9 -x = 9 - (6 - t) = 3 + t. So the denominator is sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - (6 -t))) which is sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 -6 +t)) = sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(3 + t)). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 9 - (6 -t) = 3 +t, so log(9 -x) becomes log(3 + t), so denominator is sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(3 + t)) = 2*sqrt(log(3 + t)). So the integrand in I' becomes sqrt(log(3 + t)) / [2*sqrt(log(3 + t))] ] = (1/2). But that can't be right because when I add I and I' I get 2I = ∫1 dx, which would be 2, but that would mean I=1, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try again.

Wait, substituting t=6 -x in the integral:

The integrand becomes sqrt(log(9 - (6 -t))) = sqrt(log(3 + t)).

Denominator becomes sqrt(log(9 - (6 - t))) + sqrt(log((6 - t) +3)) = sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t)).

So the integral I becomes ∫ from t=4 to t=2 [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) / ( sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t)) ) ] dt.

But since the limits are from 4 to 2, the integral is equal to ∫ from2 to4 [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) / ( sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t)) ) ] (-dt). But since dt is negative, it becomes ∫ from2 to4 [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(...)) ] dt, which is the same as the original integral I.

Wait, but that would mean I = I, which is not helpful. So maybe that substitution doesn't give me a new equation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the denominator.

Wait, in the original substitution, the denominator is sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x +3)).

When x=6 -t, 9 -x = 3 + t, and x +3 =9 -t. So the denominator becomes sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 -t)).

So the integrand is sqrt(log(3 + t)) / [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 -t)) ].

But I can write this as [sqrt(log(3 + t)) ] / [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 -t)) ] = [ sqrt(A) ] / (sqrt(A) + sqrt(B) ), where A = log(3 +t) and B= log(9 -t).

Similarly, the original integrand is [sqrt(log(9 -x)) ] / [ sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x+3)) ].

Which, when x is replaced by t, becomes [sqrt(log(3 +t)) ] / [ sqrt(log(3 +t)) + sqrt(log(9 -t)) ].

So the integrand in I' is the same as the integrand in I, so I = I', which means adding them would double it. But that approach didn't help because it suggested I + I = 2I = ∫1 dx from 2 to4, which is 2, so I=1. But the options don't have 1.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in substitution. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the integrand can be rewritten. Let me denote A = sqrt(log(9 -x)), B = sqrt(log(x+3)). So the integrand is A/(A + B). When I substitute x with 6 -x, as I did before, I get B/(B + A), which is the same as the original integrand. So the integral becomes I = ∫ [ B/(A + B) ] dx.

So I have I = ∫ [ A/(A + B) ] dx from 2 to4, and I also have I = ∫ [ B/(A + B) ] dx from 2 to4. Adding them together, I + I = ∫ [ (A + B)/(A + B) ] dx = ∫1 dx from 2 to4, which is 2. So 2I =2 → I=1. But again, 1 isn't an option. So maybe I made a mistake in my substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should evaluate the integral numerically. Let's see. The integral is from 2 to4 of [ sqrt(log(9 -x)) / (sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x +3)) ) ] dx. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can make the integral easier.

Wait, let me consider substituting u = x - 3. So when x=2, u= -1; x=4, u=1. The integral becomes ∫ from -1 to1 [ sqrt(log(6 -u)) / (sqrt(log(6 -u)) + sqrt(log(7 -u)) ) ] du. Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful because the logs are different.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry when I add the original function and the transformed function, but since each is 1/2 when added together, but no, that would make 1 as the integral.

Wait, perhaps I should try a substitution where the numerator becomes the denominator minus something. Alternatively, maybe the integral is equal to 1, but that's not an option. The options given don't include 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the integral is equal to 1, but I think that's not the case. Let me try to think differently. Since the integral I = ∫ [A/(A + B)] dx, and I' = ∫ [B/(A + B)] dx, and I + I' = ∫1 dx =2, so I=1. But since 1 isn't an option, perhaps I'm wrong somewhere.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me make sure. When I substitute t =6 -x, the integrand becomes [sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 +t)) + sqrt(log(9 -t)) ) ].

But perhaps the denominator is sqrt(log(3 +t)) + sqrt(log(9 -t)) = sqrt(log(3 +t)) + sqrt(log(9 -t)).

But wait, log(9 -t) when t =6 -x is log(9 - (6 -x)) = log(3 +x). So the denominator becomes sqrt(log(3 +t)) + sqrt(log(3 + x)).

Wait, but x is the original variable, so this is sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(3 + x)).

Wait, but x is not the same as t. Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the integrand as [sqrt(log(9 -x)) / (sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x +3)) ) ] = [sqrt(log(9 -x)) * sqrt(log(x +3)) ] / [ sqrt(log(9 -x)) * sqrt(log(x+3)) + log(9 -x) ].

Wait, that might not be helpful either. Alternatively, perhaps the integrand can be expressed in terms of logarithms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the integral is symmetric in a way that the substitution leads to the same function, so I = I, which would imply 2I=2, so I=1. But since that's not an option, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the integral is indeed 1, but perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try another approach.

Let me see what the integrand looks like at x=2 and x=4. At x=2, 9 -x=7, so log(7). At x+3=5, log(5). So the integrand there is sqrt(log7)/(sqrt(log7) + sqrt(log5)).

At x=4, 9-x=5, so log5, and x+3=7, so log7. So the integrand there is sqrt(log5)/(sqrt(log5) + sqrt(log7)).

So the integrand at x=2 is A/(A + B), where A=sqrt(log7), B=sqrt(log5). At x=4, it's B/(A + B). So the integrand at x=2 is F, and at x=4 is G, where F + G =1.

But since the integral is over the interval, we don't know if F and G are equal or not. But when we use the substitution t=6 -x, we get that the integrand becomes G at x=2, which would mean that the integral from 2 to4 of F dx is equal to the integral from 4 to2 of G dt, which is ∫ G dt from4 to2, which is ∫ G dt from2 to4 multiplied by -1. But that's the same as ∫ G dt from2 to4, because dt is just a variable. So that would make I = ∫ G dt from2 to4.

Wait, but that would imply I = ∫ G dt from2 to4. But I is also equal to ∫ F dt from2 to4. So, I = ∫ F dt and I = ∫ G dt. So F and G are different unless F=G.

But F = A/(A + B) and G = B/(A + B). So F + G =1, but F and G are not equal unless A = B.

Which would only happen if log7 = log5, which is not true. Because log7 is about 0.845, and log5 is about 0.698, so they are not equal. So F ≠ G.

So integrating F over the interval gives I, integrating G over the interval gives I as well. So I + I =2I = ∫1 dx from2 to4 =2. So I=1. But the options don't include 1. So perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me try to compute the integral numerically, even though the options don't have 1. Let me see: the integral is from 2 to4 of [ sqrt(log(9 -x)) / (sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x+3)) ) ] dx.

Let me see what this function looks like. At x=2, we have sqrt(log7) / (sqrt(log7) + sqrt(log5)) ≈ 0.919 / (0.919 + 0.780) ≈ 0.919/(1.7) ≈ 0.54. So the function starts at 0.54. At x=4, the function becomes sqrt(log5)/(sqrt(log5) + sqrt(log7)) ≈0.780/(0.780 +0.919) ≈0.780/1.7≈0.458. So the function starts at ~0.54 and ends at ~0.458. So the function is a slowly decreasing function. So the integral would be somewhere between the area under a constant 0.5 function and 0.5.

Wait, perhaps the integral is 1, but given that the options don't include it, maybe I should think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me try a different substitution. Let me set t = x -3. So when x=2, t= -1; x=4, t=1. The integral becomes ∫ from -1 to1 [ sqrt(log(6 -t)) / (sqrt(log(6 -t)) + sqrt(log(t +4)) ) ] dt.

Hmm, but I don't see any simplification here. Alternatively, perhaps this substitution isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider whether the function is symmetric. Let me compute the function at x and at 6 -x.

At x, the function is f(x) = sqrt(log(9 -x))/[sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x +3))].

At 6 -x, the function is f(6 -x) = sqrt(log(3 +x))/[sqrt(log(3 +x)) + sqrt(log(9 - (6 -x))) ] = sqrt(log(x +3))/[sqrt(log(x +3)) + sqrt(log(3 +x))].

Wait, that's the same as f(x), because in the denominator, it's the same as before. So f(6 -x) = f(x). Wait, that would imply that the function is symmetric about x=3. So then, integrating from 2 to4 would be the same as integrating from3 -1 to3 +1, which is 2 units around x=3. So the function is symmetric around x=3. So the integral from2 to4 would be twice the integral from3 to4, but that's not necessarily helpful.

Wait, but since the function is symmetric around x=3, perhaps the integral can be computed as the integral from3 to4 of f(x) dx plus the integral from2 to3 of f(x) dx, which is the same as the integral from2 to4 of f(x) dx. But that doesn't help me in computing it numerically.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed differently. Let me consider that the integral is equal to 1, but given that the options don't include 1, maybe I made a mistake in my substitution. Alternatively, perhaps there's a trick I'm missing.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substitution leads to the same integrand, so I = I, but that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the integral as the area under the curve, which is symmetric around x=3, so perhaps it's equal to 1. But since the options don't have 1, perhaps I made a mistake in my substitution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is 1, but since the options don't have it, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should choose the closest option. But the options are A:0.8, B:2.2, C:1.5, D:2.0, E:3.5, F:2.5, G:1.0, H:3.0, I:0.5, J:1.2.

Wait, the closest to 1 is G:1.0. But perhaps the correct answer is 1, but since 1 is not an option, perhaps I should choose the closest, which would be G:1.0. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution, and the correct answer is 2, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the integral was 1, which is not an option. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by thinking that the integral equals 1, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should choose the closest one, which is option G:1.0.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe when I made the substitution, I didn't realize that the function is symmetric, leading to the integral being 1. But perhaps the actual integral is 2. Let me check by evaluating at the middle point. Let me take x=3, so 9-3=6, log(6) is about 1.7918, so sqrt(log6) is about 1.34. At x=3, the function is 1.34/(1.34 + sqrt(log6)) )= 1.34/(1.34 +1.34)= 1.34/2.68≈0.5. So the function at x=3 is 0.5.

But because the function is symmetric around x=3, the integral from2 to4 would be twice the integral from3 to4, but perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is 2 because the function is 1, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the substitution t=6 -x. Let me try to compute I + I.

Wait, no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the integral is 1, so the answer is G:1.0.

But earlier, I thought that the integral was 1, which isn't an option, but perhaps the correct answer is G:1.0.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the substitution and realize that the integral is 1, so the answer is G:1.0.

But given that the options don't include 1, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 2, which is option D.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to proceed with the substitution t=6 -x. Then, the integral becomes:

I = ∫ from t=4 to t=2 [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t))) ] (-dt)

Which is equal to ∫ from t=2 to t=4 [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t))) ] dt.

So, I = ∫ from2 to4 [ sqrt(log(3 + t)) / (sqrt(log(3 + t)) + sqrt(log(9 - t))) ] dt.

Now, if I denote t =6 -x, then 9 -t =9 - (6 -x)=3 +x. So the denominator becomes sqrt(log(3 +t)) + sqrt(log(3 +x)).

But in the original integral, the denominator is sqrt(log(3 +t)) + sqrt(log(3 +x)).

Wait, that's the same as the denominator in the integrand after substitution. So the integrand in I is the same as the integrand in I'. But I = I' implies that I = I.

Wait, that doesn't help me. Alternatively, perhaps I + I = ∫1 dx, which would mean 2I = 2, so I=1.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 2, so D is the answer.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by considering that the integral is 2, so the answer is D:2.0.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me try to compute the integral numerically. Let me take x=2 and x=4. At x=2, the function is sqrt(log7)/(sqrt(log7) + sqrt(log5)) ≈0.919/(0.919 +0.780)≈0.919/1.7≈0.54. At x=4, the function is sqrt(log5)/(sqrt(log5) + sqrt(log7))≈0.780/1.7≈0.458. So the function starts at 0.54 and ends at 0.458. So the area under the curve is roughly the average of 0.54 and 0.458, multiplied by 2 units. The average is (0.54 +0.458)/2=0.50, multiplied by 2 gives 1. So the integral is approximately 1.

But since the options don't include 1, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1, so the option is G:1.0.

Wait, but the options don't have 1. So perhaps the correct answer is 2, which is option D.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. Let me consider that the function is symmetric around x=3, so the integral from2 to4 is twice the integral from3 to4. But the function at x=3 is 0.5, so the integral from3 to4 would be approximately the area from x=3 to x=4, which is a small range. But without exact computation, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the substitution and realize that the integral is 1, so the answer is G:1.0.

But given that the options don't have 1, perhaps I should proceed with the substitution and realize that the integral is 1, so the answer is G:1.0.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the substitution and realize that the integral is 2, so the answer is D:2.0.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct answer is 1, so the option is G:1.0. But perhaps the correct answer is 2, which is option D:2.0.

Wait, let me try to compute the integral numerically. Let me divide the interval into small steps and approximate the integral.

At x=2, f(x)=0.54. At x=4, f(x)=0.458. The function is decreasing from 0.54 to 0.458 over 2 units. Let me approximate the function as a straight line between x=2 and x=4.

The function at x=2 is 0.54, at x=4 it's 0.458. The slope is (0.458 -0.54)/(4-2)=(-0.082)/2=-0.041 per unit x.

So the function can be approximated as f(x) =0.54 -0.041*(x-2).

So the integral from x=2 to x=4 is the integral of (0.54 -0.041*(x-2)) dx from 2 to4.

Let me compute this.

Integral = ∫ (0.54 -0.041(x-2)) dx from2 to4.

Let me change variable to u=x-2, so when x=2, u=0; x=4, u=2.

Integral becomes ∫ (0.54 -0.041u) du from0 to2.

Compute that:

∫0.54 du =0.54u evaluated from0 to2 → 0.54*2=1.08.

∫-0.041u du = -0.041*(u²/2) evaluated from0 to2 → -0.041*(4/2)= -0.041*2= -0.082.

So total integral is 1.08 -0.082=0.998≈1.0.

So the integral is approximately 1.0, so the answer is G:1.0.

But wait, the options don't have 1.0, they do. So the answer is G:1.0, but perhaps the correct answer is 2, so D:2.0.

Wait, no, because according to my computation, the integral is 1.0. So the correct answer is G:1.0.

But let me double-check. Let me compute the integral from2 to4 of [sqrt(log(9 -x))]/[sqrt(log(9 -x)) + sqrt(log(x +3))] dx.

Let me compute it numerically using the trapezoidal rule with a few intervals.

At x=2: f(x) ≈0.54.

At x=3: f(x)=0.5.

At x=4: f(x)≈0.458.

Let me approximate the function between x=2 and x=4 as a straight line.

Between x=2 and x=3, the function decreases from 0.54 to 0.5.

Between x=3 and x=4, it decreases from 0.5 to 0.458.

So the average value over the interval can be computed as the average of the function at the endpoints and the midpoint.

Midpoint is x=3, f=0.5.

Left endpoint x=2: f=0.54.

Right endpoint x=4: f=0.458.

So the average would be the average of 0.54, 0.5, and 0.458.

But the average is (0.54 +0.5 +0.458)/3 ≈ (1.498)/3≈0.499.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is symmetric, so the integral is the area under the curve, which is approximately 1.

So the integral is approximately 1, so the answer is G:1.0.

But the options don't have G as 1.0, but they do have G as 1.0.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A:0.8, B:2.2, C:1.5, D:2.0, E:3.5, F:2.5, G:1.0, H:3.0, I:0.5, J:1.2.

So the correct answer is G:1.0.

But wait, I'm getting confused because earlier I thought the integral was 1, but perhaps I should proceed with the substitution and see that the integral is indeed 1.

So the answer is G:1.0.

But perhaps I should think that I made a mistake and the correct answer is 2, so D:2.0.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the substitution and think that the integral is indeed 1, so the answer is G:1.0.

But in any case, given the options, the correct answer is G:1.0.
</think>

The integral evaluates to 1, which corresponds to option G:1.0.

ANSWER: G
