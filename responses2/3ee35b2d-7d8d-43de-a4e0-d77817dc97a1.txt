Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the LCM of 24 and 36. Hmm, LCM stands for Least Common Multiple. I remember that the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that both of them can divide into without leaving a remainder. So I need to find the smallest number that both 24 and 36 can go into evenly.

Let me think about how to approach this. One method I remember is listing the multiples of each number until I find the smallest common one. But that might take a while, especially if the numbers are big. Wait, maybe there's a better way. Oh right, the formula for LCM is LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / GCD(a, b). Oh, right! So I can find the GCD of 24 and 36 first and then use that to calculate the LCM.

So first, let me find the GCD of 24 and 36. To do that, I can list the factors of each number. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. The common factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The greatest one is 12, so GCD is 12.

Now, using the formula, LCM = (24 × 36) / 12. Let me calculate that. 24 times 36... Hmm, 24 times 30 is 720, and 24 times 6 is 144. So 720 + 144 = 864. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 24 multiplied by 36. Oh wait, 24 × 36 = 864? Wait, let me check that calculation again. 24 * 36: 24*30=720, 24*6=144. So 720 + 144 is 864. So then, LCM is 864 divided by 12. 864 /12 is 72. Oh wait, that can't be right because 72 is one of the options. But wait, earlier I thought 72 might be the answer, but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The LCM of 24 and 36. Let's break them into their prime factors. 24 is 2^3 * 3^1, and 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. The LCM takes the highest power of each prime. So for 2, the highest power is 2^3, and for 3, it's 3^2. So LCM is 2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72. Oh, okay, so that's correct. So the LCM is 72, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought 12 was the GCD, but when I calculated (24×36)/12, I got 72. So that's consistent. So the answer should be 72, which is option C.

Alternatively, I can think of multiples. Let's list the multiples of 24: 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 288, 312, 336, 360, 384, 408, 432, 456, 480, 504, 528, 552, 576, 600, 624, 648, 672, 696, 720, 744, 768, 792, 816, 840, 864, 888, 912, 936, 960, 984, 1008... Hmm, that's a lot. Let's list multiples of 36: 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, 216, 252, 288, 324, 360, 396, 432, 468, 504, 540, 576, 612, 648, 684, 720, 756, 792, 828, 864, 900, 936, 972, 1008. Now, looking for the first common multiple in both lists. 72 appears in both, yes? 72 is in 24's list (24×3=72) and 36's list (36×2=72). So the LCM is 72.

The LCM of 24 and 36 is found by calculating (24 × 36) / GCD(24, 36). The GCD is 12, so LCM = (24 × 36) / 12 = 72. Alternatively, prime factorization shows 24 = 2³×3 and 36 = 2²×3², so LCM is 2³×3² = 72. Both methods confirm the answer is 72.
