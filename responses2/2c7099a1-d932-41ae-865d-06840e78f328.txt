Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the electric field intensity at a certain distance from a negative point charge. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for the electric field around a point charge.

Wait, the question gives me the charge in stat-coulombs, right? Oh, right, statcoulombs are another unit system used sometimes, especially in the U.S. customary system. But I think the formula for electric field uses Coulomb's law, which in SI units is E = kQ / r². But wait, what's the value of k in stat units?

Oh, right! I might be mixing up SI and Gaussian units here. Let me think. In Gaussian units, the electric field (E) at a distance r from a point charge Q is given by E = Q / (4πε₀ r²), but ε₀ is 1/(4π), so that simplifies to E = Q / r². But wait, wait—what about stat units? Oh, right, in cgs units (stat), Coulomb's law is E = (Q * k) / r², where k is a constant specific to stat units. I think the value of k is 1 in cgs units because 1 statcoulomb is defined such that E in stat-coulombs per cm² would make sense.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. In SI units, E is measured in N/C, but in cgs units, it's in dyne/cm². So the formula in cgs is E = k * Q / r², where k is 1, right? Because in cgs, 1 statcoulomb is the charge that produces a force of 1 statdyne per cm². So, yes, k is 1 in cgs units.

So the formula is E = Q / (4π ε₀ r²) in SI, but in cgs units, it's E = Q / r², because ε₀ is 1 in cgs. So, for this problem, the charge Q is 500 statcoulombs, r is 10 cm. So E is 500 / (10^2) = 500 / 100 = 5. But wait, wait—what about the sign? The charge is negative, so the electric field is directed radially inward. But the question is about the intensity, which is a magnitude, so the sign doesn't matter here.

So the electric field intensity is 5 statdynes/cm². Let me look at the options. Option A is 5 dyne/stat-coul. That matches. Wait, wait—because in cgs units, the E is in stat-dynes/cm². So yes, 5 would be the correct answer. So option A is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The formula in cgs is E = k Q / r², with k being 1. So 500 / (10)^2 = 500/100=5. So 5. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine the electric field intensity at a distance of 10 cm from a negative point charge of 500 stat-coulombs in air, we use the formula for the electric field in Gaussian units (cgs units). The formula is:

\[
E = \frac{Q}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( Q = 500 \, \text{stat-coulombs} \),
- \( r = 10 \, \text{cm} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
E = \frac{500}{10^2} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \, \text{dyne stat-coulomb/cm}^2
\]

Thus, the intensity of the electric field is \( 5 \, \text{dyne/stat-coul} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 5 dyne/stat-coul**
