Question:

is 1/4 belongs to Cantor set? Is 1/13 belongs to Cantor set? Return the two answers as a list with 1 for yes and 0 for no. For example, if you think both belong to Cantor set, return [1,1]

A: [1/3, 1/3]
B: [0, 0]
C: [0.5, 0.5]
D: [1/3, 0]

Okay, so I've got this question here about whether certain numbers belong to the Cantor set. The question is asking two things: whether 1/4 is in the Cantor set and whether 1/13 is in the Cantor set. I have to return a list with 1s and 0s for each answer, where 1 means yes and 0 means no. The options are labeled from A to J, each giving a pair of numbers.

First, I remember that the Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the middle third of each interval. The first step removes (1/3, 2/3), then each subsequent step removes the middle third of each remaining interval. So, the Cantor set consists of numbers that can be expressed in base 3 without any 1s. That is, their base-3 representations only have 0s and 2s.

So, the question is about whether 1/4 and 1/13 have base-3 representations that consist only of 0s and 2s. If they do, they belong to the Cantor set; otherwise, they don't.

Let me tackle each number one by one.

Starting with 1/4. I need to convert 1/4 into base 3. Hmm. Let's see.

1/4 in base 3. To convert a fraction to base 3, I can multiply by 3 and take the integer part each time. Let's do that.

1/4 * 3 = 0.75. Integer part is 0, so the first digit after the decimal is 0. The fractional part is 0.75.

Next, take 0.75 and multiply by 3: 2.25. The integer part is 2, so the next digit is 2. Fractional part is 0.25.

Take 0.25 * 3 = 0.75. Integer part 0, so next digit 0. Fractional 0.75.

Wait, this seems to be repeating. So the base-3 expansion is 0.020202..., with 0 and 2 repeating.

So, 1/4 in base 3 is 0.020202..., which only has 0s and 2s. So yes, 1/4 is in the Cantor set. So the first answer is 1.

Now, the second number: 1/13. Let's check its base-3 expansion.

Again, 1/13 * 3 = 3/13. 3/13 is approximately 0.230769... The integer part is 0, so the first digit is 0. Fractional part is 3/13.

Next, 3/13 *3 = 9/13 â‰ˆ 0.6923. Integer part 0, next digit 0. Fractional part 9/13.

9/13 *3 = 27/13 = 2 + 1/13. Integer part 2, so digit 2. Fractional part 1/13.

Wait a second, now we're back to 1/13 *3, which was our starting point. So the pattern repeats: 0.02020202...

So 1/13 in base 3 is 0.020202..., again only 0s and 2s. Therefore, 1/13 is also in the Cantor set. So the second answer is 1.

Now, looking at the options, each is a pair of 0s or 1s. The first answer is for 1/4, which is 1, and the second is for 1/13, which is also 1. So the list should be [1,1].

Looking at the options, option H is [1,1]. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The numbers 1/4 and 1/13 both have base-3 expansions that consist solely of 0s and 2s. Therefore, both are in the Cantor set, and the list is [1,1].

Answer: H
