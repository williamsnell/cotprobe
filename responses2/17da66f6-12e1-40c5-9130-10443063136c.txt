Okay, so I've got this question here about expressing a discount series. The series is 20-10%, and I need to find out what single discount that equals. The options are A to J, each with different percentages. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on how to calculate this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the question says 20-10%. I think that notation might mean a 20% discount followed by an additional 10%, or maybe it's a series where you apply both discounts in some way. I'm a bit confused about the exact interpretation. Let me clarify.

If it's a series of discounts, like 20% off first, then 10% off the new price, how do I find the total discount? I remember that when you apply discounts successively, the total discount isn't just the sum of the percentages because you're compounding the discounts. So, for example, if you have a 20% discount, the remaining price is 80% of the original. Then applying a 10% discount on that would be 10% of 80%, which is 8, so the new price is 72% of the original. 

So, the total discount from the original price is 100% - 72% = 28%. That would mean the total discount is 28%. Looking at the options, A is 28%. So I think that's the right answer.

But wait, another way to think about it is if the discounts are applied in a way that's multiplicative. Like, if the first discount is 20%, and then a second discount of 10%, the overall discount can be calculated by multiplying (1 - 0.20) * (1 - 0.10) = 0.8 * 0.9 = 0.72, which is 72% of the original price. So the discount is 28%, same as before.

Alternatively, if someone mistakenly adds 20% and 10%, they'd get 30%, which isn't an option. But that's not the case. Oh wait, no, the options don't have 30%. The closest is option H, which is 30%. But wait, wait, why don't I check that.

Wait, another approach. If the discount is 20% followed by 10%, the total discount is 28%, so that's correct. So the answer should be A: 28%.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's take an example. Suppose the original price is $100.

First, apply 20% discount: $100 - 20% = $80.

Then apply 10% on $80: $80 - 10% of 80 = $80 - $8 = $72.

So the total discount from the original price is $100 - $72 = $28, which is 28% of $100. So yeah, that's correct. The multiple discounts add up in terms of total effect, but the way it's calculated is by multiplying the remaining percentages.

So the correct answer is A: 28%.

The correct answer is A: 28%.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Discount Series**: The series given is 20-10%, which likely means a 20% discount followed by an additional 10% discount on the reduced price.

2. **Applying the First Discount**: 
   - Original price: $100.
   - After 20% discount: $100 - 20% = $80.

3. **Applying the Second Discount**:
   - New price after first discount: $80.
   - 10% discount on $80: $80 - 10% of $80 = $80 - $8 = $72.

4. **Calculating Total Discount**:
   - Total amount paid: $72.
   - Total discount from original price: $100 - $72 = $28.
   - Percentage discount: ($28 / $100) * 100% = 28%.

Thus, the total discount is 28%, which corresponds to option A.
