Question:

A partnership conveyed a general warranty deed representing a vacant parcel of land to the purchaser. In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?

Options:

A: No, because the couple were not aware of the covenant due to not having a lawyer and not conducting a title search.
B: No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.
C: Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.
D: Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and "assigns".
E: Yes, because the covenant was part of the original agreement and therefore applies to all subsequent owners.
F: Yes, because the couple should have conducted a title search to understand the obligations associated with the property.
G: No, because the sellers did not explicitly communicate the covenant to the couple.
H: Yes, because the couple should have hired an attorney to understand the obligations of the property.
I: No, because the special warranty deed given to the couple did not include any obligations related to the paving of the road.
J: No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about property law, specifically about warranties and covenants in a partnership deed. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario starts with a general warranty deed conveying a vacant parcel of land to the purchaser. The grantee and her assigns were required to share proportionately in the paving of a new road abutting the property. So, the original deed is a general warranty, which allows the grantee to transfer any contingent interest in the property, like a general interest.

Next, the grantee transfers the property to a married couple via a special warranty deed. Oh wait, a special warranty deed is more restrictive. It allows the grantee to transfer specific rights, like a general interest or a special interest, but not contingent. So, the original deed was a general warranty, but the deed to the couple is a special warranty.

The problem says the special warranty deed didn't include any conditions related to the paving of the new road. So, the couple, who bought via this special warranty, didn't have any obligations regarding the road's paving beyond their own initial share.

When the road was built, the couple refused to pay their share. The original seller sued the couple without a jury, and the judge ruled the couple had to pay. Then the question is whether the appellate court will affirm this order.

Looking at what each option is saying:

Option A: The couple wasn't aware of the covenant because they didn't have a lawyer or did a title search. But wait, the original deed was a general warranty, which doesn't require any further covenants. Because the original deed was general, the covenant (the sharing) was implied. The deed to the couple is a special warranty, which doesn't include any covenants. So the couple's lack of knowledge and title search probably doesn't negate the implied covenant.

Option B: The general warranty doesn't apply beyond the first purchaser. Wait, no. The original deed is a general warranty, which is a type of deed that allows for any contingent interest. But the deed to the couple is a special warranty, which doesn't include any covenants. So the general warranty applies beyond the first purchaser, but the couple's deed is a special one, which doesn't include the covenant. So option B says the general warranty didn't apply beyond the first purchaser. But the deed to the couple is a special warranty. So actually, the general warranty does apply, but the deed to the couple doesn't impose that covenant. So B seems incorrect because the general warranty does apply, but the deed to the couple isn't subject to it. So B might be wrong.

Option C: The couple is responsible because the seller is a landowner. Wait, in the original deed, the seller is presumably the grantee, and she transferred a general interest. The original deed is a general warranty, which allows the grantee to transfer any contingent interest, but the deed to the couple is a special warranty. So, under the general warranty, the grantee was required to share the road's paving. But if the deed to the couple is a special warranty, that covenant doesn't apply to them. So option C suggests that the couple is responsible, which isn't the case because the general warranty exists but the deed to the couple doesn't include the covenant. Thus, C is incorrect.

Option D: The covenant is a running covenant because intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and assigns. No, because a running covenant is implied in a general warranty deed, but this is a special warranty, not a running one. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The couple pays because the covenant was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs. Hmm, no. The issue is whether the covenant applies to the couple. The original deed is a general warranty, which includes the covenant. The special deed doesn't include it. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The couple didn't conduct a title search. But the issue isn't about whether they did a title search, but about whether the covenant applies. The fact that they didn't conduct a title search doesn't negate the implied covenant. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: They hired an attorney to understand the obligations. No, the original deed was a general warranty, which doesn't require any further covenants. The deed to the couple didn't include any covenants either. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The couple should have hired an attorney. Not necessarily; the issue is whether the covenant applies, not whether the grantee knows about it. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The special warranty didn't include the condition. The original deed was a general warranty, which includes the condition. The special deed didn't, so the covenant didn't apply. So I is incorrect.

Option J: No because the special warranty didn't include the condition. That's correct, because the original deed was a general warranty, not a special. So J is correct. The couple's deed didn't include the condition, so the general warranty existed but the deed to the couple doesn't impose it. Thus, the couple can't claim the share.

Now, the question is whether the trial judge's order stands. The original seller sued the couple without a jury, and the trial court ruled the couple had to pay. On appeal, the options are whether the appellate court will affirm.

So the key point is whether the general warranty (original deed) implied a covenant that the couple should pay their share. Since the couple's deed is a special warranty, which doesn't include the covenant, the court must decide whether the general warranty applies beyond the first purchaser. But wait, the original deed was a general warranty, which allows the grantee to transfer any contingent interest. So the covenant exists. But the deed to the couple is a special warranty, which doesn't include the covenant. So the couple's deed doesn't impose that covenant. Therefore, the couple can't claim. So the trial court's ruling is correct, and the appellate court would reverse. So the question is, does the trial court's ruling stand?

But wait, the trial court ruled that the couple had to pay, but the original seller's deed (general warranty) implied the covenant. So the trial court's ruling is based on that. The appellate court's decision would be based on whether the couple's deed (special) includes the covenant.

Wait, but the trial court ruled the couple had to pay. So the trial court's decision is that they have to pay. So the appellate court's decision would be whether that's correct.

Ah, but the question is asking whether the appellate court will affirm the trial judge's order. So the correct answer is whether the trial court's ruling was correct.

If the trial court ruled that the couple had to pay, that's correct because the general warranty implied that. But if the couple's deed didn't include that covenant, the trial court would have to say that. So the trial court's ruling was correct.

So the appellate court's decision would be to affirm. Thus, the appropriate answer is option J: No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the couple and it was not.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-examine. The original deed is a general warranty. The deed to the couple is a special warranty. So the general warranty included the covenant. So the trial court's ruling that the couple had to pay is correct. So the appellate court would affirm. So which option corresponds to that?

Looking at the options, the question is whether the appellate court will affirm. So the correct answer is whether the trial order was correct.

Option J is correct because the paving requirement was not placed in the special warranty deed, so the trial court's ruling is correct. So the answer is J.

Wait, but the options of the question are about whether the trial judge's order is correct. So the correct answer is whether the trial court's ruling is correct.

The correct answer is J: No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the couple and it was not.

Wait, but in this case, the original deed was a general warranty, which included the covenant. The couple's deed didn't include it. So the trial court ruled the couple had to pay because the general warranty implied that. Since the trial court did that, the appellate court would affirm. So the correct answer is J, which says exactly that.

So the answer is J.

The question revolves around the implications of a general warranty deed and a special warranty deed in a property dispute. The key issue is whether the trial court ruled correctly that the couple had to pay their share of the road paving, given that the original deed was a general warranty implicitly covenanted the couple to pay.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The couple's lack of knowledge does not negate the implied covenant in a general warranty deed. The general warranty exists beyond the first purchaser, and the deed to the couple, being a special warranty, does not include the covenant.
  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The general warranty applies beyond the first purchaser, but the deed to the couple, being a special warranty, does not include the covenant. Thus, the general warranty does not apply to the couple's deed.
  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The couple's deed is a special warranty, which does not include the covenant. Therefore, the covenant does not apply to them.
  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. A running covenant is not implied in a general warranty deed. The covenant in question is part of the general warranty.
  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The covenant is not intended to apply to the couple's heirs and assigns. It is part of the general warranty.
  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The couple didn't conduct a title search, which is irrelevant to whether the covenant applies.
  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The covenant was part of the general warranty, not a running covenant.
  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The trial court's ruling was correct because the general warranty implied the covenant, and the couple's deed did not include it.
  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Hire of an attorney is not required for this issue.
  
- **Option J**: Correct. The paving requirement was not placed in the special warranty deed, so the trial court correctly ruled the couple had to pay. The trial court's order stands, and the appellate court should affirm.

ANSWER: J
