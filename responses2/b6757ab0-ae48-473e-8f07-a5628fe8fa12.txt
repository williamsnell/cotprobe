Question:

A homeowner wished to have his house painted. He contacted a number of house painters in his area and asked them to submit bids to do the work. The homeowner received 10 bids. The first nine offered to paint the house for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $12,500. The 10th bid was sent by telegram and was supposed to be for $10,000. However, the telegraph company made a mistake and transmitted the bid as $1,000. The homeowner immediately accepted the 1 0th bid, but the 1 0 painter refused to perform. The I 0th painter's best defense in an action for breach of contract by the homeowner would be

Options:

A: that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission, because of the disparity between its bid and the others.
B: that the telegraph company should be liable as an independent contractor.
C: that the homeowner deliberately exploited the telegraph company's mistake.
D: that the telegraph company's mistake nullifies the contractual agreement.
E: that the homeowner's immediate acceptance of the bid was unreasonable.
F: that the discrepancy between the bid and the actual cost of painting is too large.
G: that the homeowner was under an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.
H: that the bid was not legally binding as it was sent via telegram.
I: that the homeowner failed to provide accurate specifications for the job.

Okay, so I've got this contract question in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The homeowner hired several painters and got 10 bids. The first nine were from painters who wanted to pay between $10k and $12.5k. Then there's the 10th bid, which was supposed to be $10k but came through as $1k due to a transmission mistake. The homeowner accepted the $1k bid and the painter refused. Now, the question is about the painter's defense when suing for breach of contract.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what the best defense would be. Let's think about contract law. A contract must be legally binding. If the bid was made via a third party, like a telegraph company, that's a possible issue.

Wait, the home owner sent the bid via telegraph. But the telegraph company made a mistake and sent $1k instead of $10k. So actually, the bid was incorrect. So if the contract was based on the bid, and the bid was wrong, then the contract might not be valid because it relied on a false statement.

But wait, contracts can sometimes be based on estimates. So if the painters were estimating the cost and the bid was an estimate, but the estimate was wrong, then the contract might be based on an estimate and not enforceable. Or maybe if the bid was a rejection, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the bids were submitted by the painters. The 10th bid was supposed to be $10k but was received as $1k. So the painter received a bid that was much lower than they expected. So if the painters accepted that bid, is that acceptable?

Wait, but the problem is that the bid was wrong. So perhaps the contract was based on an estimate. If the estimate was wrong, the contract might not be enforceable because the estimator was incorrect. But in some cases, if the estimate is incorrect, the contract can still be valid because the person making the estimate is considered an agent in good faith.

Alternatively, the mistake could be intentional. The telegraph company made a mistake, but that's a mistake of law, not an intent to cheat. So the contract might still be valid because the error was unintentional.

Wait, but the bids were sent by the painters. So the painter who made the $1k bid might have been under the impression that the painters were only going to charge $10k. But in reality, the actual cost was way higher. So if the painter was based on an estimate, and the estimate was wrong, perhaps the contract is still enforceable.

Wait, but the issue is whether the painter's bid is a good faith estimate. If the painter was under the impression that the actual cost would be $10k, but it's actually more, could that be a breach of contract because they were basing the estimate on an incorrect assumption?

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's look at the options.

Option A says the homeowner was aware of the mistake because of the bid disparity. But the bids were for $10k, $12k, and $1k. The 10th bid was way off. So maybe the painter thought the bid was $10k but it was actually $1k. So the painter might have thought the painters were being very cheap. That would mean that the painter's bid was lower than the actual cost, which could be a breach.

Option B: the telegraph company was liable as an independent contractor. But the telegraph company made a mistake, but that's an error of law, not negligence. So the company isn't liable for the mistake, because it's not their fault. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: the homeowner exploited the mistake. The mistake could be an attempt at deception, but it's not clear if that was done with intent. The mistake is a mistake of law, so it's more about the contract being enforceable rather than the intent. So C might not be correct.

Option D: the contract was null because the bid was from a third party. Remember, the bids were from the painters, so the contract was based on their estimates. If the estimate was wrong, the contract might still be valid if the estimator was acting in good faith. But wait, in some cases, if the estimate is incorrect, the contract is unenforceable. So D might not be right.

Option E: the homeowner's acceptance was unreasonable. But if the bid was wrong, maybe the painter should have accepted a more reasonable bid. So E might not be the best defense.

Option F: the discrepancy is too large. The bid was $1k, which is much lower than the others, but the other bids are $10k to $12.5k, so the difference is significant. But the problem is that the bid was incorrect, not that it's too big to be a mistake.

Wait, but the bids were based on estimates. So if the painter thought the estimate was $10k, but it was actually $1k, that could be a breach. So A says the painter was aware of the mistake because of the bid disparity. But the bid was $1k, which is way off, so the painter might have thought the painters were being very cheap, hence the bid.

Alternatively, if the painter was based on an estimate that was wrong, then the painter might have intended to charge more. So by accepting an incorrect bid, the painter is breaching the contract.

So the correct answer would be that the painter was aware of the mistake because the bid was wrong, which makes option A correct.

Alternatively, another angle: the 10th bid was $1k. The others are like $10,000 to $12.5k. So the $1k bid is lower than the others. So the painter thought the painters were going to be very cheap, but in reality, painting is more expensive. So the painter's bid was incorrect, so the contract is not valid.

So the defense is that the painter was aware of the mistake because the bid was wrong, which is option A.

Wait, but what's the legal principle here? If the estimator makes a mistake, the contract might still be valid as long as it's not a material misstatement. In this case, the $1k is a 100% difference from the others. So it's a material error, which would make the contract invalid. But the problem is that the 10th bid was wrong, but the other bids were accurate.

Wait, so the correct contract is based on the other bids. If the 10th bid is wrong, then the contract is broken. So the painter's best defense would be that the bid was wrong, hence the contract is invalid because the estimator was incorrect.

Wait, but the options don't directly address this. Option A is that the painter was aware of the mistake because of the bid. So the bid was wrong, which would make the painter's bid incorrect, hence breach.

So I think the correct answer is A.
</think>

The homeowner received a $1,000 bid from a telegraph company, which was a mistake. The painter, upon accepting this bid, sued for breach of contract. The painter's defense hinges on the belief that the bid was wrong.

**Option A** suggests the painter was aware of the mistake due to the bid disparity. This is correct because the $1,000 bid was significantly lower than the other bids, prompting the painter to consider that the painters were being very cheap, which is a material misrepresentation of the estimate.

Other options are less relevant. Option F's large discrepancy is not the issue here; instead, the main issue is the estimate being incorrect. Option D's nullification of the contract depends on whether the estimate was made on good faith, which is not supported by the information. Option E's reasoning is incorrect as a $1,000 bid is not unreasonable given the circumstances. Option B and D are incorrect because the telegraph company's mistake is an error of law, not negligence. Option C is incorrect as exploiting a mistake is not a defense against contract law issues.

Thus, the painter's best defense is that they were aware of the bid's mistake, making **A** the correct answer.
