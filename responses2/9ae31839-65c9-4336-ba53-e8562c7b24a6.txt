Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all."

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the legacy of Erasmus and the influence of the humanist movement. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is asking about what made Erasmus's legacy more significant than that of earlier humanists. The options are A to J, each giving a different point. I'll need to think about what I know about Erasmus and humanism.

From what I remember, humanism was a movement that emphasized learning, reason, and the classical tradition. It was centered in the Catholic Church and had a significant influence on later religious thought. Erasmus was a key figure in this movement.

Erasmus wrote about the foundations of a spiritual life, like how humans are created in the image of God, and the idea that all people are created equal. He corresponded with scholars like Copernicus and others. He also wrote about the spread of knowledge, like the idea that the knowledge of the ancients is preserved through generations.

Wait, the question mentions something about his collection of proverbs. He wrote about the HalloweenceProverbs, which were a collection of proverbs drawn from ancient sources. So he was known for his literary works, which were part of his humanist approach.

I think one of the points about the legacy being more significant is that he was one of the first to translate Latin proverbs into the vernacular. Because Latin was the classical language, translating it would make the classical heritage more accessible to the masses, which would have been a significant contribution to the humanist movement. So option C says he was the first to translate Latin proverbs into the vernacular.

Alternatively, another point is that humanists were more critical of the church, challenging its teachings. Erasmus wrote against the Church's practices, like the heresy of the free will, which would have influenced later movements like the Reformation. But that's a point about the influence on the Church, not the humanist legacy itself.

Another thought: The humanist movement was broader than just translating. They also included other ideas like the human spirit's power, the idea that knowledge is the only thing that can change the world. So perhaps the legacy was more about the intellectual and cultural contributions rather than just translating. 

Looking at the options, option H is about making the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it. That aligns with the idea that translating Latin proverbs into the vernacular would make the classical style more accessible, which would have helped spread the humanist ideas. 

But wait, option C is about translating proverbs into the vernacular. So, if that's correct, that's a key point to make his legacy more significant. Because translating meant making the classical texts more understandable, which would have democratized classical learning, allowing more people to access and understand the knowledge, thus strengthening the humanist movement.

Another point is the variety of interests. So, he was interested in more subjects than just the classical ones. That would have expanded the humanist influence. Option I is that he valued educating the masses more â€“ yes, that's true because he was involved in spreading knowledge and teaching.

Wait, the question is about the legacy being more significant than earlier humanists. So, what makes his legacy stand out? Maybe his contributions to the classical heritage, translating it, and making it more accessible. So both C and H seem relevant. But the options are A to J, and the question is which statement is correct.

The question is about the legacy being more significant. So, the key point is that he translated Latin proverbs into the vernacular, making the classical style more accessible. That would have allowed more people to learn from the classics, which is important for the spread of humanism.

Alternatively, option H says he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it. That seems right because by teaching the classical spirit, he exposed the masses to the principles of the past, which would have been part of the humanist approach.

So, the correct answer would be H or C. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the options are:

C: he was the first to translate Latin proverbs into the vernacular
H: he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it

The question is about the legacy being more significant. So, making the classical spirit accessible would have been a key part of that. So H is a point about accessibility, which is part of the legacy.

Alternatively, translating proverbs would have allowed more people to understand classical texts, which is part of the spread of humanism.

Wait, another angle: the humanists were more critical of the Church, which was a big part of their legacy. But the question is about the legacy being more significant. So perhaps the translation of proverbs is a key part of that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. So, to recap: the options are about what made his legacy more significant.

Option C: he was the first to translate Latin proverbs into the vernacular. This would have made the classical proverbs more accessible, which is a big part of the humanist movement's influence.

Option H: he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it. That's similar to C, but perhaps more directly about teaching the spirit.

Wait, but the question is about the legacy being more significant. So, perhaps both C and H are correct, but the options are single answers.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the first to translate proverbs into the vernacular allowed the classical thinking to reach a wider audience, thus contributing to the humanist legacy.

But I'm a bit confused because H also sounds correct. Let me think about each answer's reasoning.

Option A: He wrote exclusively about religious matters. No, he wrote about philosophy and the human spirit.

Option B: He wrote a greater number of books. I don't think that's correct. The humanists, including Erasmus, were known for their works, but not necessarily writing more books than predecessors.

Option C: First to translate Latin proverbs. That makes sense because the classical texts were in Latin, and making them understandable would help the masses.

Option D: He was more critical of the Church than predecessors. That's true, but the question is about humanist legacy, not Church influence.

Option E: He had a wider variety of interests. That's true, but again, not the humanist legacy itself.

Option F: Less interested in the academic context. No, he was more involved in practical matters.

Option G: More support from the Church. I don't think so. He was against the Church's teachings, as he wrote against them.

Option I: Valued educating the masses. He did this by spreading knowledge, which is part of his legacy.

Option J: He wrote in a language understandable to the masses. That's actually option C's point.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J? Because he wrote in Latin, but he translated it. Or is it C?

Wait, the question is about his legacy. So, making the classical spirit accessible (option H) is a key part. Alternatively, translating proverbs into the vernacular (option C) is a way to spread the classical heritage.

So, the correct answer is either C or H. But looking back, the first part of the question says, "What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity."

Wait, the text after that says: "Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance."

So, the humanists had monopolized the classical culture, making it accessible only to a few. But Erasmus was able to bring it to a wider audience by translating it. So, his translation was a key part of the humanist legacy.

But the question is about the legacy being more significant than earlier humanists. So, perhaps his translation made it more accessible, thus contributing to the spread of humanism.

Alternatively, perhaps his ability to make the classical spirit accessible, which he did by teaching it, is a key point.

Wait, the options are C and H. I'm trying to remember which one is correct. In the original text, the user wrote that he was able to offer much more than just the proverbs. He not only translated them but also provided a more substantial collection. But the options are about the options provided.

Wait, the options are:

C: he was the first to translate Latin proverbs into the vernacular.

H: he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it.

Wait, perhaps H is the correct answer. Because the humanist legacy is about spreading the classical spirit, making it accessible. So H is about teaching the spirit, which is a way to spread it.

Alternatively, C is about the proverbs being more accessible, which is also a key part of the legacy.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. I should try to think of the key points. The classic spirit refers to the teaching of the humanistic values. So, making the classic spirit more accessible (through translation or teaching) would be a key part of humanist legacy.

So the correct answer is likely H: he made the classic spirit more accessible by teaching it.

Wait, but the first part of the question says that he was able to introduce the classical spirit to a wider circle. So perhaps the legacy was the dissemination of the classical ideas, which included translating proverbs.

Wait, but the question is about the legacy being more significant. So, perhaps the answer is C, because he was the first to translate, making the classical texts more accessible. Or H, because he made the spirit accessible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option says.

Option C: first to translate proverbs into the vernacular. That would mean that other humanists before him couldn't do it.

Option H: he taught the classic spirit, which would have allowed more people to understand it.

So, the question is about the legacy being more significant. So, perhaps making the proverbs more accessible (C) is part of that. Or making the spirit more accessible (H).

Wait, I think both C and H are correct, but the options are single choice. So, the question is about what made his legacy more significant. The key factor is making the classical material more accessible, which would allow a wider audience to understand it. So that would be option H.

So, the correct answer would be H.
