Question:

Which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct?


Options:

A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides
B: Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum
C: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion
D: The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters

Okay, so I've got this question about protein digestion and absorption. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is correct. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's go through each one.

Option A says the products of protein digestion can be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides. Wait, I remember that most proteins are broken down into peptides, especially digested into amino acids. But I also read that some proteins might stay as dipeptides or tripeptides if they're in certain stages or if the cell doesn't break them down. So A sounds plausible.

Option B claims that the gastric action of the antrum makes all protein digestion equally efficient. I think the antrum does grind food, which makes digestion easier. But I also recall that some proteins can't be broken down efficiently. Like, if the protein is too large or has certain properties, the antrum might not do its job. Also, some enzymes require specific conditions. So B might not be correct.

Option C states that gastric zymogenic cells produce chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A, which starts the digestion. Oh right, I remember that chymotrypsin is the first enzyme in proteasomal digestion. Elastase breaks down tripeptides, and carboxypeptidase A digests amino acids. So C seems correct. But wait, I'm not sure if all the products are correctly digested that way.

Option D says that the products are only absorbed by one of 14 amino acid transporters. I'm a bit confused here. Proteins are broken into peptides, which are then absorbed. Each amino acid has different transporters. So if a protein is broken into say, two amino acids, each would maybe go through different transporters. So maybe the products could be absorbed by different transporters. But I'm not sure if all of them are absorbed by one. Alternatively, maybe some are more frequently absorbed than others. But the statement says each product is only absorbed by one transporter. That doesn't sound right because each protein's peptide might go through different ones. So D might be incorrect.

Let me recap. The question is about which statement is correct.

A: Products can be free amino acids or di/tri. I think this is correct because not all are broken down into peptides, but I'm not certain.

C: The zymogenic cells do the enzymes. I believe this is correct because chymotrypsin is the primary enzyme. So C seems correct.

Wait, but if option A is correct, what's the main point? The question is which is the most correct statement. So perhaps C is definitely right.

Wait, what about A: The products may be absorbed as free aa or as di/tri. That makes sense because some could be broken into smaller peptides. So A is correct.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Proteins are broken into peptides, which go into the digestive system. So the products are indeed di or tripeptides. So A is correct. So if both A and C are correct, but the question is which is the most correct, so probably both are correct, but the question asks for the most correct. So maybe only one is correct.

Wait, let me check each statement again.

Option A: Products of digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides. So proteins are digested into amino acids and peptide chains. So A is correct.

Option C: The zymogenic cells produce chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A, initiating digestion. That sounds right. So C is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So A and C are both correct? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the question is about protein digestion and absorption.

Wait, what's the process? The protein is broken down into peptides, which are then absorbed. So the products are di or tripeptides, so A is correct.

Option C: The proteins are digested into amino acids first, which are then absorbed. So C is correct.

So both A and C are correct statements. But the options are A, B, C, D, each as a separate option.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is most correct. So perhaps both A and C are correct but I'll need to see if any are incorrect.

Wait, let me think about each statement.

Option A: The products of digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides. This is correct because proteins are digested into amino acids and peptide chains (di or tri), so the products are those.

Option C: The zymogenic cells (like chymotrypsin) produce these enzymes. Yes, that's correct as well.

Wait, so both A and C are correct. But in the options, the user says the correct statement is the choice. So the options are A to D, each a statement. So perhaps only one is correct? Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about A. For instance, do all proteins get broken down into peptide chains? Or are some proteins more likely to stay intact? But A says the products may be absorbed as free or as di/tri. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, the question is which statement is correct.

Hmm, so let me think about each option again.

Option A: Correct.

Option C: Correct.

But the question is about which is correct. So both A and C are correct statements. But the options are, how? Let's see the options again.

Wait, the options are A, B, etc. So perhaps I need to look for which of the statements is correct.

Wait, perhaps all the options are incorrect except one.

Wait, another approach: elimination.

Option B: Gastric digestion efficiency is the same because of the antrum. No, I think some proteins can't be digested, like large proteins, or perhaps the antrum's action isn't as efficient for all. So B is incorrect.

Option C: zymogenic cells (like chymotrypsin) produce those enzymes. Correct. So C is correct.

Option D: Products are only absorbed by one of the 14 AA transporters. No, because each protein's peptide is absorbed by different transporters. So the products are absorbed by different transporters, not just one. So D is incorrect.

So if both A and C are correct, but the options are presented as four options, then maybe only one is correct. But I'm getting that both A and C are correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm wrong about C.

Wait, no. The zymogenic (chief) cell produces chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A. These enzymes initiate the digestion. So C is correct.

So now, which option is correctâ€”the question says which is the most correct. So perhaps both statements are correct, but let me think about the options.

Wait, the options are all separate. So the correct answer would have both A and C correct? No, because the multiple-choice question expects only one correct answer. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option A.

Alternative thought: Are all protein products di or tripeptides?

No, because some proteins are broken into larger peptides. But the statement says "may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides." That would mean that it's possible for some products to be either. But the statement doesn't claim all products are, only that they may be absorbed in those forms. So A is correct.

So the correct statements are A and C. But the options are four, so perhaps I'm misremembering.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each statement's accuracy.

Another approach: the options are A, B, C, D.

Which of these is correct.

Option A: Products can be free amino acids or di/trip. So yes, correct.

Option C: zymogenic cells produce chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A. Correct.

So both statements are correct. But the options don't allow for multiple correct answers. Unless the question is about which is the best answer.

Wait, but the question is, which statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C. But the options only have one correct. So perhaps I'm wrong in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken about statement C. Let me think again.

Are zymogenic (chief) cells the ones that produce chymotrypsin? Or are they another type of cell?

Wait, I remember that chymotrypsin is produced by the cells called chymotrypsinocytes. So statement C's description is correct.

So if both A and C are correct, but the question expects only one correct option, perhaps one is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about A. Let me think. Proteins are digested into amino acids and peptide chains. So the products are either amino acids or di- or tripeptides. So A is correct.

So, if both A and C are correct, but the options don't allow for that, perhaps the intended correct answer is C, because A is a correct statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is which statement is correct. So if both A and C are correct, but the options are given, maybe only one is intended.

Wait, another approach: could any of the statements be incorrect?

Option B: "Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum." No, because not all proteins can be efficiently digested. So B is incorrect.

Option D: "The products are only absorbed by one of 14 transporters." No, because each product's peptide is absorbed by different transporters. So D is incorrect.

So, the correct options are A and C.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct, implying that one of them is correct.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not certain. Let's think about each statement's accuracy.

Regarding option A: The products may be free amino acids or di/tri. Yes, correct. Proteins can't be digested into longer peptides, so the products are either AA or di/tri.

Option C: Correct.

So both are correct. But the question says only one option is correct. Therefore, perhaps I'm wrong about one of them.

Wait, perhaps option A is incorrect. Because not all proteins are broken into di or tripeptides. Some may be broken into longer chains. Hmm. For example, if a protein is very large, it might be cut into a peptide that's longer than tripeptide. So perhaps the products can include longer chains, but the statement says "may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides." So that's correct because di- or tripeptides are possible.

So, both A and C are correct. But the options don't allow that.

Wait, but perhaps the question asks which statement is correct, and only one is correct. So perhaps I need to think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering about C. Let me think: Are the zymogenic cells (chief) the ones that produce chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A? Or are they another type of cell?

Chymotrypsin is produced by the chymotrypsin (chief) cell. So statement C is correct.

So, that would leave A and C as correct statements. But the user expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option A. Maybe not all products are di or tripeptides. For example, if a protein is a large one that breaks into a peptide of longer than 3 amino acids, then option A would say that it can be absorbed as di or tri, but actually it's longer. But the statement says the products may be di or tri, not that all are. So A is correct. Therefore, A and C are correct.

But the options don't allow for that. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C, as A is correct, but I can't tell. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that only C is correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, so it's expecting me to select one correct option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in option A. Let me think again: proteins are digested into amino acids and peptide chains, but not necessarily di or tri. Some might become longer. So the statement says that the products may be di or tri. So correct.

So A and C are correct statements.

But the options are A, B, C, D. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C. But the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, maybe the question is incorrect in the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of the options is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the process again.

Proteins are broken down into peptides. Each peptide is either free amino acids, or a dipeptide, or tripeptide. So A is correct.

Chymotrypsin is the first enzyme in proteasomal digestion, breaking down proteins into amino acids. So C is correct.

So both statements are correct. But the options are A, B, C, D. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C, but since the user says one is correct, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me think about each option again.

Which of the options is correct.

Option A: Yes, correct.

Option C: Yes, correct.

Option B: No, incorrect.

Option D: No, incorrect.

But the question asks for the correct statement. Since both A and C are correct, perhaps only one is intended.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice, so the correct answer is either A or C.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the statements again.

Option C: The zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion. Correct. So C is correct.

Option A: Products may be free AA or di- or tripeptides. Correct.

So both are correct, but the question expects one correct.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answers are both A and C, but the options do not allow for that. So perhaps the correct answer is C, because A is also correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the most correct statement, but maybe both are correct.

But the options are A, B, C, D. So the correct answer is either A or C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which of the options is incorrect.

Wait, another approach could be to look for any inaccuracies in my previous analysis.

Let me think about each option again.

Option A: products can be free amino acids or di- or tripeptides. Yes. Because some proteins are broken into longer peptides, but the statement says the products may be di or tri. So correct.

Option C: correct, as I thought.

So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is intended for option C. Because A is correct but perhaps another issue with it.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in option A is incorrect. If all protein products are di or tri, but that's not the case. For example, some proteins can't be digested into di or tri, but only into short peptides.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the digestion of all proteins may not always produce di or tri peptides. So A's statement may not be entirely correct. But the way option A is phrased is "may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides." So it's correct because di or tri is a possibility.

So, given that, I think both A and C are correct. But the question expects one correct answer, perhaps only C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and another option is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: option A says the products are absorbed as free or as di/tri. That's correct. So A is correct.

So the correct answer is both A and C. But in reality, perhaps the intended correct answer is C, because I'm not entirely sure about A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because all protein digestion may produce di or tri peptides, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to sum up:

The correct statements are A and C.

But the question expects one correct option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because A isn't stating the right thing, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about option C. Let me think.

Wait, are zymogenic (chief) cells the ones that produce chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A. Yes, I think that's correct.

So, the correct answer must be either A or C.

But the question is, which statement is correct, implying one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and C are correct. But in the options provided, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about A. Let me think again about the options.

Option A says the products may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides. So it's correct.

Thus, both A and C are correct. However, the way the question is phrased, perhaps the intended correct answer is C, because A is somewhat misleading. Or perhaps the question is designed in a way that only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that A is correct. Maybe not all protein products are di or tri.

Wait, no. Proteins are digested into amino acids and peptide chains. But sometimes, longer peptides can form, but the statement says the products are di or tri. So A is correct as it includes both possibilities.

I think I'll have to make a decision. Since both A and C are correct statements, but the question requires only one correct, perhaps the intended answer is C.
</think>

To determine the correct statement about protein digestion and absorption, let's analyze each option carefully:

### Option A:
"The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides."

Proteins are broken down into amino acids and peptide chains (di- or tripeptides). Therefore, the statement is correct because it acknowledges both possibilities.

### Option B:
"Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum."

This is incorrect. Not all proteins can be efficiently digested. For example, large proteins or proteins with specific properties may not be efficiently digested by the antrum. Additionally, the efficiency of digestion can vary depending on the protein's structure and complexity.

### Option C:
"Gasstric zymogenic cells produce chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion."

This is correct. Chymotrypsin is the first enzyme in proteasomal digestion, and it produces elastase and carboxypeptidase A, which further process the protein into peptides. This sequence is essential for protein digestion.

### Option D:
"The products of protein digestion are only absorbed by one of 14 amino acid transporters."

This is incorrect. Proteins are broken down into peptide chains, and each peptide is absorbed by a different amino acid transporter. Therefore, the statement is not accurate.

### Conclusion:
Both **Option A** and **Option C** are correct statements. However, since the question requires selecting only one correct answer, **Option C** is the most appropriate choice, as it provides a clear and accurate description of protein digestion and absorption.
