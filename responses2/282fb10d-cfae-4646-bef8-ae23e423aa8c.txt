Okay, so I have this question here about the growth rates of different functions. Hmm, I need to figure out which type grows the slowest. Let me think.

The options are A to J, each with a different time complexity. I remember that time complexities are usually ranked from the fastest to the slowest. The function with the slowest growth is the least efficient. So, I should arrange these functions in order from fastest to slowest.

Let's list them out again:

A: O(N)
B: O(log log N)
C: O(N!)
D: O(log N)
E: O(N^N)
F: O(2^N)
G: O(N log N)
H: O(N^3)
I: O(N^2)
J: O(log e^N)

Wait, option J is O(log e^N). Oh, because e is a constant, log e^N is the same as log N, right? Because e^N is just e multiplied by itself N times, so log(e^N) = N * log e, and since log e is 1, it's O(N). So J is the same as A. That might be a typo, but I'll note that.

So now, the options can be grouped as A and J (both O(N)), and perhaps another pairing.

Let's compare each function:

1. O(log log N): This is the slowest among the logarithmic functions. Like, O(log N) grows very slowly, and O(log log N) grows even more slowly.

2. O(log N): This is faster than O(log log N), so A is faster than B.

3. O(N): This is linear, which is way faster than the logarithmic and even the O(N log N), O(N^2), etc.

4. O(N^2): Quadratic growth, which is faster than O(N log N) since log N grows slower than any polynomial.

5. O(N log N): This is faster than O(N^2), because it's N multiplied by log N.

6. O(N^3): Cubic growth is faster than O(N log N), because 3 is higher than 1.

7. O(2^N): Exponential growth. I remember that exponential functions grow faster than any polynomial. So exponential is the fastest among the options given.

8. O(N!): Factorial growth. Factorial is even faster than exponential. Because N! is N × (N-1) × ... × 1, which grows faster than 2^N. So factorial is faster than exponential.

9. O(N^N): That's a really fast growth. For example, when N is 3, it's 3^3=27. N=4: 4^4=256. It's way more than exponential.

10. O(log e^N) → same as A: O(N), which is linear.

So arranging all in order from slowest to fastest:

B: O(log log N) → slowest.

J: same as A → O(N).

Then D: O(log N).

Then C: O(N log N).

Wait, no, because O(N log N) is faster than O(N^2), which is O(N^2) grows as N squared, and O(N log N) is N multiplied by log N. So D is O(log N), then B, then D is O(log N), then C is O(N log N), then A and J (linear). Then O(N^2), O(N^3), O(2^N), O(N!), O(N^N).

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. After O(N log N), the next is O(N^2), followed by O(N^3), then 2^N, then N factorial, and N^N is the fastest.

Wait, O(2^N) grows faster than O(N^3) because exponential outpaces polynomials, but I think O(N^3) is faster than O(2^N) for small N, but for large N, exponential beats polynomial.

Wait, no. Let me think: For N approaching infinity, 2^N grows faster than any polynomial. So 2^N grows faster than N^3. So O(2^N) is faster than O(N^3).

Similarly, N! grows faster than exponential. Because N! is the product of all positive integers up to N, which is much more than exponential.

So the order from fastest to slowest:

A and J: O(N)

D: O(log N)

B: O(log log N)

C: O(N log N)

E: O(N^N) → fastest.

F: O(2^N) → next.

G: O(N log N) → same as C.

Wait, no, O(N log N) is C, same as D? No, D is O(log N), C is O(N log N). So the order would be:

A and J → O(N)

D: O(log N)

B: O(log log N)

C: O(N log N)

E: O(N^N) → fastest.

F: O(2^N) → next.

G: O(N log N) → same as C.

Wait, no, because 2^N grows faster than N! because exponential outpaces factorial. So E is faster than C and G.

So the order from slowest to fastest:

1. B: O(log log N) → slowest.

2. J: O(N) → same as A.

3. D: O(log N).

4. B: O(log log N) → no, wait, B is O(log log N), which is slower than O(log N).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reorganize the functions in order.

Let me list them:

- A: O(N)
- B: O(log log N)
- D: O(log N)
- C: O(N log N)
- G: O(N log N) → same as C
- E: O(N^N)
- F: O(2^N)
- H: O(N^3)
- I: O(N^2)
- J: O(N)
- F and G: same as C.

Wait, no, G is O(N log N) same as C. So the list of options is:

A: O(N) → same as J.

B: O(log log N).

D: O(log N).

C: O(N log N).

G: same as C.

E: O(N^N) → fastest.

F: O(2^N) → next.

H: O(N^3) → next.

I: O(N^2) → next.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 2^N is O(2^N), which is faster than N^3, which is O(N^3). So E is faster than H.

So the order from slowest to fastest:

B (O(log log N)) → slowest.

J (O(N)) and A (O(N)) → next.

Wait, no. Because A and J are O(N), which is the same as the linear function.

Then comes O(log N), then O(N log N).

Wait, I think the correct order is:

Slowest: B.

Then A and J: O(N).

Then D: O(log N).

Then B again, but wait, D is O(log N), which is slower than B. So after A and J, D is next.

Then C: O(N log N).

Then G: same as C.

Then E: O(N^N) → fastest.

Then F: O(2^N).

Then H: O(N^3).

Then I: O(N^2).

Wait, but this can't be correct because 2^N is O(2^N), which is faster than N^3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to list all functions in order from slowest to fastest.

The slowest is the one with the slowest growth rate.

Looking at each function:

O(log log N) is the slowest because it's the logarithmic of a logarithm. It's the slowest among functions that grow slower than linear.

Then O(log N) is next.

Then O(N log N) is a linearithmic function, which is faster than O(N^2), O(N^3), etc.

Wait, no, O(N log N) is O(N) multiplied by log N, which is faster than O(N^2) because log N grows slower than any polynomial.

Wait, no, O(N^2) is O(N^2), which is O(N * N), so N log N is O(N * (very slow)).

Wait, O(N log N) is faster than O(N^2) because the log N term doesn't compensate for the N^2. For example, N^2 is polynomial, log N is logarithmic, but any polynomial with exponent higher than 1 is faster.

So the order from slowest to fastest is:

B: O(log log N) → slowest.

J: O(N) → same as A.

D: O(log N).

B: O(log log N) → same as B? Wait, no, I think I messed up.

Wait, no, because O(log log N) is slower than O(log N), which is slower than O(N), which is same as O(N). So:

1. B: O(log log N) → slowest.

2. J: O(N) → same as A.

3. D: O(log N).

4. C: O(N log N).

5. G: O(N log N) → same as C.

6. E: O(N^N) → fastest.

7. F: O(2^N) → next.

8. H: O(N^3) → next.

9. I: O(N^2) → next.

10. B again? Or is B the same as J?

Wait, no, J is O(N), which is same as A. So the order is:

Slowest: B.

Next: A and J.

Then D: O(log N).

Then C.

Then G: same as C.

Wait, no, because C and G are both O(N log N), same.

Then E is O(N^N), which is faster than C.

So the correct order from slowest to fastest is:

1. B: O(log log N)

2. J: O(N) (same as A)

3. D: O(log N)

4. C: O(N log N)

5. G: same as C.

6. E: O(N^N)

7. F: O(2^N)

8. H: O(N^3)

9. I: O(N^2)

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because O(2^N) grows faster than O(N^3). So after E comes F.

Wait, so the correct order is:

Slowest: B.

Next: A and J.

Then D: O(log N).

Then C: O(N log N).

Then G.

Then E.

Then F.

Then H.

Then I.

Wait, that can't be right because 2^N is E, which is faster than N^3, which is H.

Wait, no, O(2^N) grows faster than O(N^3), so E is faster than H, which is O(N^3).

Wait, no: O(2^N) is exponential, which grows faster than any polynomial. So E is faster than H.

So the order from slowest to fastest is:

B (O(log log N)) → slowest.

Then J (O(N)).

Then D (O(log N)).

Then C (O(N log N)).

Then G (same as C).

Then E (O(N^N)).

Then F (O(2^N)).

Then H (O(N^3)).

Then I (O(N^2)).

Wait, no, that can't be because 2^N is faster than N^3. So E is faster than H.

So the correct order from slowest to fastest is:

B (slowest), then J (same as A), then D, then C and G (same), then E, then F, then H, then I.

So the slowest function is option B, and the fastest is E.

But the question is asking which types of functions grow the slowest. So the slowest is B.
</think>

The slowest-growing function is the one with the slowest growth rate. Among the given functions, the slowest is O(log log N), as it grows the least among all the logarithmic functions. 

Correct answer: B
