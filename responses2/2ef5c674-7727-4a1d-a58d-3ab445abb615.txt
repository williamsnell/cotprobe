Okay, so I need to figure out which option corresponds to the Pleistocene ice mass in North America centered in the Rocky Mountains. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that the Pleistocene is a period in Earth's history, about 12,000 to 11,600 years ago. It's a time of significant warming and ice age changes. The ice ages started around 11,000 years ago and lasted until around 14,000 years ago. So, the Pleistocene ended around 11,600 years ago.

Now, the Rocky Mountains in North America are part of the North American Great Plains, which is a major glacial region. I think the Rockies are a key area in the study of the Pleistocene. The ice ages in North America, particularly in the Rockies, were associated with the presence of the Bering Land Bridge and the Great Divide. The Great Divide separates the Northern and Southern Great Divides, leading to thehi and low seasons, which are tied to the ice ages.

Looking at the options provided, I need to recall what each of them represents. The options are:

A: Mississippi
B: Rocky Mountain
C: Appalachian
D: McKenzie Corridor
E: Pacifica
F: Cascadian
G: Sierra Nevada
H: Laurentide
I: Beringia
J: Cordillera

I think the key here is identifying which region was associated with the end of the Pleistocene. I remember that the last ice age in North America was the late Pleistocene, which ended around 11,600 years ago. The Rocky Mountains are central to that area. The Bering Land Bridge, which connects the Northern and Southern Great Divides, was active during that time, leading to the ice ages.

Looking at the options, "Rocky Mountain" (option B) is likely referring to the Rocky Mountains themselves. So, the Rocky Mountains are part of the area where the last ice age ended, making option B the correct answer.

The correct answer is **B: Rocky Mountain**, as it represents the area associated with the end of the Pleistocene ice age in North America, centered in the Rocky Mountains.

Answer: B
