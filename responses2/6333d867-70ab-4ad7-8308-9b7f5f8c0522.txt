The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen," 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fearâ€”but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a historical event, specifically the Declaration of the Rights of Women and the Female Citizen from 1791. The question is about factors that prevented the kind of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage.

Let me read the question again. The first part talks about the Declaration of the Rights of Women, which was a bold statement, but it didn't achieve the hoped-for results. The speaker in the second passage, Olympe de Gouges, described her experience of poor peasants working without fear, but nothing changed except her rights. The key point is that her hopes didn't come true.

The question is asking which factor is likeliest to have prevented the kind of progress she was hoping for. The options are A through J.

I remember that the Declaration of the Rights of Women was a significant event, but in Algeria, after the war of independence, things didn't improve as hoped. The speaker, Olympe de Gouges, was a woman who worked for her children, and she didn't get a better education. So, the progress she was hoping for was limited because the government didn't seem to care about women's rights. 

Looking at the options:

A: Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites. Hmm, the government's response might have been more about maintaining their power, not necessarily hostile. So this might not be the main issue.

B: Inadequate healthcare facilities. The passage mentions that the peasants were poor and didn't get better education. But healthcare isn't mentioned as an issue in the passage. So probably not B.

C: Corruption within the new government. The passage doesn't mention corruption, but it's possible. However, I'm not sure if this is the main factor.

D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform. The Declaration was a national liberation document, but perhaps the government didn't focus on social reforms. So, maybe D is a factor.

E: Resistance from foreign powers. Algeria was under French control, and resistance from outside might not be a big factor in this context, especially since the focus is on political change.

F: Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure. The passage says the peasants were poor and didn't get better education, but doesn't mention infrastructure. So probably not F.

G: Lack of support from the general population. The passage mentions that the children were poor, so perhaps the general population didn't support education. That might be a factor.

H: Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism. The passage doesn't mention this at all, so maybe H is not relevant.

I: Economic instability. The passage doesn't say that. It's about the lack of education, not economic issues directly.

J: Lack of educational resources. This fits because the children didn't get a better education. So J could be a factor.

Wait, the question is about what prevented the sort of progress. The passage doesn't mention economic factors, just the lack of education. So between G and J.

The issue is likely that the government didn't focus on social reforms beyond national liberation. So D is about whether they prioritized national liberation over social reforms, which would prevent social progress. Similarly, J is about lack of resources, which also prevented progress.

But the passage doesn't mention either of these. Let me think again. The Declaration was about women's rights, but in Algeria, the government didn't implement it, so they didn't lead to social changes. So factors that prevented social reforms, like lack of resources (G) or lack of support (J), would prevent progress.

Wait, the question is about factors that prevented the sort of progress she was hoping for. So the progress she wanted (like education) didn't happen because the government didn't support it. So the lack of educational resources (J) would prevent her children from getting a better education, which is progress.

Alternatively, the lack of support from the general population (G) might be a factor. The passage says the women were poor, so maybe their support was low, but the focus was more on national protection rather than social reforms.

Wait, the question is about the sort of progress she was hoping for. She was hoping for better education, so the lack of resources (J) would prevent that. Or, perhaps the failure to prioritize social reforms (D) would prevent that.

But in the passages, the focus is on the women's rights, but the main issue is about the lack of education, which is due to the government's lack of support or lack of resources.

So between G and J, the answer is likely G or J.

Wait, the options are G, J, and others. The passage doesn't mention economic factors, so J is more about lack of resources. The question is about the sort of progress she was hoping for (which was better education, not social reforms or national liberation). So J is about lack of resources, which prevented her children from getting better education. That would prevent the sort of progress she was hoping for.

Alternatively, the failure to support social reforms (D) would prevent that. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the options.

The options are:

D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform.

The passage didn't mention D. It was about women's rights, but the focus was on national protection, not social reforms. So perhaps this factor prevented progress.

But the question is about what prevented the sort of progression she was hoping for. If she wanted social reforms, then it's about lack of support from the general population or lack of resources.

Wait, the question says "the sort of progress" she was hoping for. The sort of progress she was hoping for might be social reforms, like better education for women. So the factors preventing that would be either lack of support (G) or lack of resources (J), or failure to prioritize social reforms (D).

But the passage doesn't mention any of these. It just says the police were busy. So perhaps the lack of resources (J) is the main factor. Because the women's rights were a big deal, and without resources, their education was limited.

So I'm leaning towards J: Lack of educational resources.

The question asks which factor is likeliest to have prevented the kind of progress hoped for by the woman in the second passage, who sought better education for her children. The woman was hoping for social reforms, particularly education, but the passage does not mention economic factors, lack of resources, or support from the general population. The focus is on the lack of resources (J), which prevented her children from accessing quality education. 

ANSWER: J
