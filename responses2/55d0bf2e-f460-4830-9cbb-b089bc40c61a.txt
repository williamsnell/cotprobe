Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a freight train being pulled by an engine. It starts from rest and moves along a level track. After 5 minutes, the train reaches 5 mph. Then, after picking up more freight cars, it takes 10 minutes to reach 7 mph. We need to find out the mass of the added freight cars. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate the difference in mass.

Hmm, I remember that when a force is applied to an object, its acceleration can be found using Newton's second law, F = ma. Since the engine is at full throttle, the force applied is constant because the engine is doing work at maximum. So the force F is the same in both scenarios.

Wait, but the problem says that the frictional forces are the same in both cases. So when the engine pulls the train, the net force is the engine's force minus the friction. Let me think: F_net = F_engine - F_friction.

Right, so in the first case, the train starts from rest and after 5 minutes (which is 300 seconds) reaches 5 mph. Then, after adding more mass, it takes 10 minutes (600 seconds) to reach 7 mph. Friction is the same, so the net force must be what's driving the acceleration.

Since the engine is at full throttle, the engine's force is constant, right? So F_engine is the same in both scenarios.

Let me setup the equations. For each case, the acceleration can be found using kinematics. Since the train starts from rest, the initial velocity (u) is 0. So the final velocity (v) is equal to acceleration (a) multiplied by time (t).

Wait, but I think we can relate acceleration to force. Newton's second law says F_net = m_total * a. And F_net = F_engine - F_friction.

So in the first scenario, F_engine - F_friction = m1 * a1. And in the second scenario, F_engine - F_friction = m2 * a2.

Wait, but m1 is the initial mass of the train (4200 slugs), and m2 is the total mass after adding the freight. So the difference between m2 and m1 is the added mass.

So let's denote m2 = m1 + added_mass. So added_mass = m2 - m1.

So, let me write the two equations:

First case: F_engine - F_friction = m1 * a1

Second case: F_engine - F_friction = m2 * a2.

Wait, but since F_engine - F_friction is the same in both cases, I can set m1 * a1 = m2 * a2.

So, m1 * a1 = m2 * a2.

But wait, this assumes that the net force is same in both cases, which is correct because the engine is doing the same work in both situations.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the first case, the engine is pulling the train with a net force F_net1 = m1 * a1. In the second case, F_net2 = m2 * a2. But both are equal to F_engine - F_friction. So yes, m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So, m2 = (m1 a1) / a2.

But, wait, I can find a1 and a2 from the given velocities and times.

Let me compute the velocities. They are given in mph, but units are in slugs and time in minutes. I should probably convert the velocities to consistent units.

Wait, the problem uses slugs. So mass is in slugs, which is a unit of mass. Force would be in slug·ft/s² (since F = ma, a in ft/s², m in slugs).

But for acceleration, it's ft/s², but units might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can work with mph and minutes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's convert the velocities from mph to some consistent units.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to work with acceleration in ft/s², since that's a standard unit. Let me think.

First, let me convert 5 mph and 7 mph into feet per second.

Wait, 1 mile = 5280 feet, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

So, 5 mph is 5 * (5280/3600) ft/s.

Calculate 5 * (5280 / 3600) = (5 * 5280) / 3600.

5280 / 3600 is 1.466666... So 5 * 1.466666 ≈ 7.3333 ft/s.

Similarly, 7 mph is 7 * 5280 / 3600 = (7 * 5280)/3600.

5280/3600 is same as 528/(360) = 1.466666..., so 7 *1.466666 ≈ 10.26667 ft/s.

So, v1 = 5 mph = ~7.333 ft/s.

v2 =7 mph ≈10.2667 ft/s.

Time is given in minutes. Let's convert to seconds.

5 minutes = 5 *60=300 seconds.

10 minutes= 600 seconds.

So, for the first case, acceleration a1 = (v1 - 0 ) / t1 = (7.333 ft/s) / 300 s ≈ 0.024444 ft/s².

Wait, but wait, 7.333 / 300 is approximately 0.024444 ft/s².

Second case, a2 = (10.2667 ft/s) / 600 s ≈ 0.0171112 ft/s².

Wait, but wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, 5 mph is 5 * 5280 / 3600 = 5 * (5280/3600) = 5 * (22/15) = (110/15) ≈ 7.3333 ft/s.

Time is 5 minutes = 300 seconds. So a1 = 7.3333 / 300 ≈ 0.024444 ft/s².

Similarly, 7 mph is 7 * 5280 /3600 = 7 * (22/15) = 154/15 ≈10.2667 ft/s.

Time is 10 minutes =600 seconds. a2=10.2667/600 ≈0.017111 ft/s².

So a1 = 0.024444 ft/s², a2=0.017111 ft/s².

Wait, but wait, Newton's second law says F_net = m a.

But in both cases, F_net = F_engine - F_friction. Let me call this F_net.

So F_net1 = m1 * a1.

F_net2 = m2 * a2.

But since F_engine is same in both cases, and F_friction is same.

So F_engine - F_friction = m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So m1 a1 = m2 a2.

We can rearrange to find m2 = (m1 a1) / a2.

We know m1 is 4200 slugs.

So m2 = (4200 * a1) / a2.

Compute this: (4200 * 0.024444) / 0.017111.

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 4200 * 0.024444 = 4200 * (24444/100000) → 4200 * 0.024444 is approximately 4200 * 0.024444.

Wait, 4200 * 0.02 = 84, 4200 * 0.004444 ≈ 4200 * 0.004444= about 18.6668. So total about 102.6668.

Denominator: 0.017111.

So m2 ≈ 102.6668 / 0.017111 ≈ 6000 slugs.

Wait, because 100 / 0.017111 is approx 5850 (since 1/0.017111 is approx 58.5). 600 * 58.5 is about 35100, but wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let's compute 102.6668 / 0.017111.

Let me compute 102.6668 ÷ 0.017111.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 0.0001 to make it easier:

1026668 / 17.111.

Hmm, 17.111 * 6000 = 102666.

So 1026668 /17.111 = 6000 plus a bit.

Wait, 17.111 * 6000 = 17.111 *6 *1000 = 102.666 *1000=102666.

Our numerator is 1026668, which is 1026666 + 2. So that gives 6000 + 2/17.111 ≈ 6000 + 0.1168 ≈ 6000.1168 slugs.

Wait, but that can't be right because m2 is 4200 + added mass. So adding about 1800 slugs? Wait, because 6000 -4200=1800. Wait, but the options don't include 6000. Wait, the options are A:2400, B:2800, C:1200, D:1400, E:1600, F:2600, G:1000, H:2200, I:1800, J:1600.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, another approach: The change in acceleration is from 0.024444 to 0.017111, which is a decrease of about 0.007333 per second. So the acceleration reduces by about 0.007333 ft/s².

Wait, but the mass increases by the added freight, so the acceleration decreases. Since acceleration is inversely proportional to mass (from F=ma). So when acceleration is lower, mass is higher.

So, from the two scenarios, a1 = (m1 a1) / m2 = a1 = (F_net1), and same for a2.

But wait, F_net1 = m1 a1, and F_net2 = m2 a2.

So F_net1 = F_net2.

So m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So m2 = (m1 a1) / a2.

Let me try plugging the numbers again.

m1=4200 slugs.

a1=7.3333 /300 =0.024444 ft/s².

a2=10.2667/600=0.017111 ft/s².

So m2 = (4200 * 0.024444) / 0.017111.

Compute numerator: 4200 * 0.024444.

Well, 4200 * 0.024444 is approximately (4200 * 0.024444) = 4200 * (24444/1000000) → 4200 * 0.024444 ≈ 102.66668 slugs* ft/s².

Denominator is 0.017111.

So 102.66668 / 0.017111 ≈ 6000. So m2 is 6000 slugs.

So the added mass is m2 - m1 =6000 -4200=1800 slugs. So that would be option I:1800 slugs.

Wait, but in the options, option G is 1000, H is 2200, I is 1800. So the added mass is 1800 slugs, which is option I.

But wait, let me make sure. Because another approach: the acceleration is F_net / m.

So F_net = m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So m2 = (m1 a1) / a2.

Hmm, but another way: since F_net is same, F_net = m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So, m2 = (m1 a1)/(a2) = (4200 * 0.024444)/(0.017111) = (102.66668)/(0.017111) ≈6000.

So m2=6000, so added mass is 1800 slugs, option I.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when dealing with units, mistakes can happen.

Wait, 5 mph equals 7.333 ft/s.

Yes: 5 mph * (5280 ft/mile)/(3600 s/hr) = (5 * 5280)/3600 = (26400)/3600 =7.3333 ft/s.

Similarly, 7 mph is 10.2667 ft/s.

Time is 5 min=300 s, 10 min=600 s.

a1=7.3333/300=0.024444 ft/s².

a2=10.2667/600 = 0.017111 ft/s².

So the calculation is correct. So m2=6000. So added mass is 1800 slugs, option I.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the freight train using Newton's second law, \( F_{\text{net}} = ma \), where \( F_{\text{net}} \) is the net force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. The engine applies a constant force, while friction is assumed to be the same in both scenarios. The net force in each case is \( F_{\text{net}} = F_{\text{engine}} - F_{\text{friction}} \), which is the same for both situations.

### Key Equations:
1. \( F_{\text{net}} = m_1 a_1 \)
2. \( F_{\text{net}} = m_2 a_2 \)
3. Since \( F_{\text{net}} \) is constant, \( m_1 a_1 = m_2 a_2 \).

### Given Data:
- Initial mass: \( m_1 = 4200 \, \text{slugs} \)
- Final mass after adding freight: \( m_2 = m_1 + \Delta m \) (where \( \Delta m \) is the added mass)
- First scenario: \( v_1 = 5 \, \text{mph} = 7.333 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( t_1 = 5 \, \text{min} = 300 \, \text{s} \)
- Second scenario: \( v_2 = 7 \, \text{mph} = 10.2667 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( t_2 = 10 \, \text{min} = 600 \, \text{s} \)

### Step 1: Calculate accelerations
Using \( a = \frac{v}{t} \):
- \( a_1 = \frac{7.333}{300} \approx 0.024444 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \)
- \( a_2 = \frac{10.2667}{600} \approx 0.017111 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \)

### Step 2: Relate accelerations to masses
From \( m_1 a_1 = m_2 a_2 \), solve for \( m_2 \):
\[
m_2 = \frac{m_1 a_1}{a_2}
\]
Substitute \( m_1 = 4200 \, \text{slugs} \), \( a_1 = 0.024444 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), and \( a_2 = 0.017111 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \):
\[
m_2 = \frac{4200 \cdot 0.024444}{0.017111} \approx 6000 \, \text{slugs}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the added mass
The added mass is:
\[
\Delta m = m_2 - m_1 = 6000 - 4200 = 1800 \, \text{slugs}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mass of the added freight cars is \( 1800 \, \text{slugs} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
