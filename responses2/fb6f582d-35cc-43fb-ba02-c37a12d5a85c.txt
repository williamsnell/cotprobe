Okay, so I've got this question about warranties and what can be invoked when a merchant turns out to be unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. Let me try to break this down.

The question is asking which of the listed warranties can be used by the buyer in this scenario. The merchant is found out to be unfit, so I'm thinking about the different types of warranties available.

First, I remember that there are different types of warranties, like title, merchantability, and others. Each has its own scope. The key here is that the item is defective and unsafe, so the seller couldn't fulfill their duties. So the buyer's rights depend on what the merchant can prove to be true.

Option A is Warranty of title. That typically refers to the seller being able to pass title back. But if the item is defective, the seller might not be able to claim title. So I don't think A is valid here.

Option B is Implied warranty. Implied warranties are often based on breach or defects. Since the item is found to be unfit, maybe the implied warranty covers that. But I'm not sure if that's a standard option. I need to think more.

Option C is Warranty of merchantability. This means the item can be sold or used as intended. If the item is defective, the merchant might not be able to sell it, but I'm not certain if this is a recognized warranty.

Option D is Warranty of suitability. This would cover if the item is suitable for its intended use. Since it's unfit, the suitability is in question. I think this might apply, as the item is not suitable for its purposes, so the merchant can't be sold as intended.

Option E is warranty of non-infringement. This usually applies if the use of the item doesn't infringe on any rights. If the item is found to be unfit, this might apply, but I'm not sure.

Option F is warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. This seems relevant because the item is meant for a particular use. If it's unfit, this would cover that purpose. So F could be a valid option.

Option G is warranty of durability. This is about the item lasting, but the question is about being unfit, so durability probably doesn't apply here.

Option H is express warranty. That's a broad term, usually for defects like malfunctions. But since it's a specific item, maybe not applicable unless it's a general express warranty.

Option I is warranty of safety. If the item is unsafe, then safety isn't a concern, so this might not be valid.

Option J is warranty of quality. Quality is about the condition, which isn't directly related to being unfit, so I don't think that's the case here.

So now I have to figure which of these are applicable. The item is unfit, so it's not suitable for its purpose. So the merchant can't sell it as intended, so the warranty of suitability (D) might apply. Also, if the item is unfit, the merchant can't be sold as intended, so the warranty of non-infringement (E) might apply. But I'm not entirely sure about E.

Wait, what's the difference between non-infringement and fitness for a particular purpose? Non-infringement would mean that the use doesn't infringe on any rights, so if someone uses it in a way that's not harmful, it's okay. Fitness for a particular purpose is about it being suitable for that specific use. If the item is unfit, it's not suitable for its purposes, so F might apply.

Alternatively, the implied warranty might apply because the item is found to be defective. But sometimes implied warranties are based on defects, so maybe D applies.

I'm a bit confused between D and F. Let me think again. The item is unfit, so the merchant can't perform their duties. If the item is meant for a particular purpose, and it's unfit, then the merchant can't fulfill the intended use. So the merchant can't sell it, which would relate to F. So F seems applicable.

Wait, the question says the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. So it's not suitable for its intended use. The implied warranty would probably apply, but I'm not certain.

Another approach: looking for which options apply. The options given include D and F. I need to recall if a merchant can claim that the item is not suitable for its purpose.

I think the implied warranty of suitability could apply because the item's condition is such that it's not suitable. So D is suitable. But F is also about being suitable for a particular purpose. Since the purpose is the ordinary one, the item is unfit, so F would make sense too.

Wait, but the question is about the buyer's options. The buyer can invoke which warranties. Since the item is unfit, the merchant can't perform, so the buyer has certain rights.

The correct answer is probably either D or F. Also, sometimes, a merchant can claim that the item is not suitable for its purpose, which would be F. But I remember that sometimes, the implied warranty of suitability is a standard one. So F is a possible correct answer.

Alternatively, if it's not suitable for its ordinary purpose, then F would apply. So the answer could be F or D. I'm a bit torn.

Wait, the question is about which can be invoked. The item is unfit, so the merchant can't perform, but the buyer can invoke certain warranties. The implied warranty of suitability would be that the item is suitable for its purpose. Since it's not, the buyer can't invoke F. Because F is about being suitable for a particular purpose, which it's not.

Wait, no, F is about being suitable for a particular purpose. So if the item is not suitable for its purpose, F doesn't apply. So that leaves D as the correct option, because the item is unfit, so the merchant can't sell it as intended, which is covered by the implied warranty of suitability.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Another way: the buyer can claim the merchant's implied warranty of suitability because the item isn't suitable for its purpose. So the buyer can't sell it as intended, so the merchant can't be sold, but I'm not sure if this is a recognized warranty.

Alternatively, the implied warranty of non-infringement might apply because the use of the item is not in violation. But the item is found to be unfit, so it's not suitable for its purposes. So non-infringement might not apply here.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is F. Because if the item is found to be unfit, it isn't suitable for its purpose, so the merchant can't be sold as intended. Therefore, the implied warranty of suitability (D) is not applicable, but F is.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the item is not suitable for its purpose, then the merchant can't be sold as intended, which would relate to F. So F would apply.

I think I need to look up the standard implied warranties. Wait, implied warranty of suitability is a standard one. So D is correct.

Alternatively, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose isn't about being suitable but about being suitable for use. But if the item is found to be unfit, then it's not suitable for its purposes. So F would not apply.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Implied warranty.

The correct answer is **D: Implied warranty**.

The buyer can invoke the implied warranty of suitability because the merchant has demonstrated that the item is not suitable for its ordinary purposes. This means the item is unfit and thus cannot be sold as intended. The implied warranty of suitability covers the merchant's inability to sell the item as intended, which is a valid right under the circumstances. 

Other options, such as the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose (F), are not applicable because the item is found to be unfit, and the buyer cannot invoke this warranty. Instead, the implied warranty of suitability (D) is the most relevant and applicable option.
