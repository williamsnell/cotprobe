C: Evaluating the frequency of the child's use of gestures and sign language
D: Observing the child's interactions with peers during play

Okay, so I've got this question about early language acquisition, and I need to figure out the two approaches mentioned. Hmm, I remember from my studies that there are different methods to assess how a child is learning a language. Let me think.

First, I think one approach is about looking at what the child knows. If the question says option B is measuring vocabulary size and language quality, that makes sense. That way, you can see how much they know and how good their grammar and vocabulary are. So B is definitely one approach.

Then, the other approach might be about observing how the child interacts with others during play. Option D talks about observing interactions with peers. Play is a big part of language acquisition because you're interacting with others, which helps you learn new words and sounds. So D is probably the second method.

Wait, what about option C? It mentions evaluation of gestures and sign language. That sounds more like a non-verbal approach. It's important because language development also includes motor skills, but the question is about two approaches in general, not necessarily non-verbal. So maybe C isn't the main one here.

So the two main approaches would be assessing the child's vocabulary and language skills (B) and observing their interactions with peers (D). So the answer should be B and D.
