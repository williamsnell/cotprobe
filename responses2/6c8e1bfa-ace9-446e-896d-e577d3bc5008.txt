Okay, so I've got this question here about when you can attend an R-rated movie without an adult. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the legal and age restrictions here. Let me think through this.

I remember that in many countries, especially in the US, there are age and legal requirements for attending certain types of movies. I think it's something to do with minors and the content rating. R-rated movies are generally considered for adults, but there might be exceptions.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me try to recall. I think in the UK, there's something about children under 16 being allowed to watch R-rated movies. So, if you're 16 or older, you can watch them. But if you're younger, like 14 or 15, maybe you need an adult to be with you?

Alternatively, I've heard that some places might allow minors up to a certain age without an adult. Sometimes, it's up to 18, but that might vary. Oh, right, I think in some places, minors younger than 18 can attend R-rated movies with an adult, but maybe not without one. So, someone 16 could watch an R-rated movie with an adult, but maybe not alone.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me double-check. So, I think in the US, for example, the rule is that minors under 18 can attend R-rated movies with an adult. But I'm not sure if they can watch alone. Or is it that 18 and above can't watch alone, but under 18 can with an adult? I'm a bit tangled here.

Wait, another angle: the legal aspect. R-rated content can be purchased by minors, but the movie's production or the audience might require an adult to watch it. So, perhaps the correct answer is that you can attend an R-rated movie without an adult only if you're 16 or older. Because I think in some places, minors up to 16 can watch alone, but older minors might need an adult. Or maybe it's the other way around: you can watch alone if you're 16 or older, but not younger.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think about the typical answer. I think in the US, minors under 18 can watch R-rated films with an adult, but not alone. So someone who's 16 can attend alone. So the correct answer would be option B, which is 16.

Alternatively, another perspective: maybe in some places, even 16-year-olds can watch alone. I'm not sure. But I think in many places, like the UK, they might allow minors up to 18 without an adult, but no, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that in the UK, minors up to 16 can watch certain films, but I'm not certain about R-rated ones. So the answer could be 16, option B.

But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should recall the exact rules. Let me think: in the UK, the legal age for seeing an R-rated movie is 16, but you can watch it with an adult. So if someone is 16, they can attend alone, but perhaps not if they're under 17. Wait, no, I think it's that minors up to 18 can watch alone, but in some places, especially in the US, it's that only those 18 and older can watch alone, but younger can watch with an adult.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of an example. If I'm 16 and I see an R-rated movie, can I watch it alone? Or do I need an adult?

I think in the US, the correct answer is that you can watch an R-rated movie without an adult if you're 18 or older. But younger minors might have to watch with an adult. So someone 16 could watch alone. So option B.

Alternatively, another source says that minors under 18 can watch R-rated movies without an adult, but perhaps only if they're 18 or older. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe minors under 18 can watch R-rated movies with an adult, but not alone.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to summarize. The correct answer is likely 16, as that's the age where minors can watch R-rated movies without an adult. So the answer would be option B.

The correct answer is B: 16. At 16 years old, minors can attend R-rated movies without an accompanying adult.
