Okay, so I've got this economics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about someone's utility after buying full insurance. Alright, let me read it again.

So, there's an individual with logarithmic utility from wealth. Current wealth is $20,000. There's a 50% chance of a $10,000 loss from a car accident. Insurance is competitively provided at actuarially fair rates. We need to compute the utility if the individual buys full insurance.

Wait, logarithmic utility. Right, logarithmic utility functions are usually something like U(W) = ln(W), where W is wealth. So, the utility would be the natural log of the wealth after the event.

But wait, in this case, the individual buys full insurance. So, full insurance would mean they pay the insurance company for the entire potential loss. So the insurance covers the entire $10,000 loss, right? Because buying full insurance would mean they don't have to pay anything for the accident, but they don't get the $10,000 either.

So, let me think about the expected utility. Since there's a 50% chance of a loss and 50% chance of no loss, I need to compute the expected utility from both scenarios and then take the expected utility, but wait, the question says "compute the utility if the individual buys full insurance." Oh wait, that's the utility in that scenario.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. If they buy full insurance, they don't take the risk. So their wealth would be current wealth minus the insurance payment. But since insurance is actuarially fair, the premium is equal to the expected loss. Let me compute that.

Current wealth is $20,000. The expected loss is 0.5 * $10,000 = $5,000. So the insurance company would charge $5,000 per person, right? So if the individual buys full insurance, their net wealth would be $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000.

So their wealth after the accident is $15,000, and with full insurance, they don't have to pay anything. So their utility is ln(15,000).

Wait, but let me think again. If the individual buys full insurance, does their wealth become their initial wealth minus the insurance premium? Or is it that they pay the insurance premium regardless of the outcome?

Oh, wait, no. If they buy full insurance, they would pay the insurance company $5,000, and their wealth becomes $20,000 - $5,000 = $15,000. So their wealth is fixed at $15,000, regardless of the accident. So the utility is ln(15,000).

Wait, but I need to compute that ln(15,000). Let's see, using a calculator, but I don't remember the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expected utility. But wait, the question is asking for the utility if they buy full insurance, not the expected utility. So in this case, their wealth is fixed at $15,000.

So the utility is ln(15,000). Let me estimate that because I don't remember the exact value. Let's think: ln(10,000) is about 9.21 (since ln(10) is ~2.3026, so ln(10^4)=4*ln(10)=~9.21). Then ln(15,000) is ln(10,000 * 1.5) = ln(10,000) + ln(1.5) = 9.21 + 0.4055 ≈ 9.6155.

Looking at the options, option B is 9.616, which matches this. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: Let me compute ln(15,000) more accurately. Let me think about it.

Alternatively, I can use natural logarithm properties. ln(15,000) is ln(15 * 10^3) = ln(15) + ln(10^3) = ln(15) + 3*ln(10).

I know ln(10) ≈ 2.302585, and ln(15) is ln(3*5) = ln(3) + ln(5). ln(3)≈1.0986, ln(5)≈1.6094. So ln(15)=1.0986 +1.6094≈2.708.

So ln(15,000)=2.708 + 6.9077 (since 3*ln(10)=3*2.302585≈6.90774) → 2.708 +6.9077≈9.6157. So approximately 9.616, which matches option B.

So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves an individual with logarithmic utility from wealth who currently has $20,000. There is a 50% chance of a $10,000 loss due to a car accident, and insurance is competitively provided at actuarially fair rates. The task is to compute the utility if the individual buys full insurance.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Logarithmic utility: \( U(W) = \ln(W) \), where \( W \) is wealth.
   - Current wealth: $20,000.
   - 50% chance of a $10,000 loss.
   - Insurance is actuarially fair, so the premium covers the expected loss.
   - Full insurance means the individual pays the insurance company $5,000 (actuarially fair rate) and retains all possible losses.

2. **Calculating Wealth After Insurance**:
   - Current wealth: $20,000.
   - Insurance payment: $5,000.
   - Wealth after loss: $15,000 (since full insurance eliminates the risk of loss).

3. **Computing Utility**:
   - Utility function: \( U = \ln(15,000) \).
   - Breaking it down: \( \ln(15,000) = \ln(15 \times 10^3) = \ln(15) + 3\ln(10) \).
   - \( \ln(15) \approx 2.708 \), \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \), so \( 3\ln(10) \approx 6.9078 \).
   - Total utility: \( 2.708 + 6.9078 \approx 9.6158 \), which rounds to approximately 9.616.

4. **Matching with Options**:
   - Option B: 9.616.
