Okay, so I have this Python question here: what's the output of 4*1**4? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the order of operations, but let me think through it.

Wait, in Python, the exponentiation operator is **, right? And I remember that it has higher precedence than multiplication. So the order is important here. Let me break it down.

The expression is 4 multiplied by 1 to the power of 4. Let's compute that step by step. 

First, compute 1**4. Oh right, 1 to any power is just 1. So 1**4 = 1.

Then the expression becomes 4 * 1. 4 multiplied by 1 is 4. So the result should be 4.

Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option H is 4. So the answer should be H.

The expression `4*1**4` evaluates as follows:

1. Compute the exponentiation first: `1**4 = 1`.
2. Multiply by 4: `4 * 1 = 4`.

The result is **4**, which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H: 4
