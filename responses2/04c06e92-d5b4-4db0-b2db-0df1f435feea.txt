Okay, so I have this question about finding the first five energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy levels in hydrogen are quantized, meaning they have specific, discrete values. The formula for the energy levels is something like E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (Z²)/(n²), right? But wait, hydrogen has Z=1, so that simplifies things a bit.

So the formula becomes E_n = -13.6 eV / n². Let me list out the first five energy levels. For n=1, E_1 is -13.6 eV. For n=2, it's -13.6 /4, which is -3.4 eV. Then n=3, it's -13.6 /9, which is about -1.51 eV. n=4 would be -13.6 /16, that's -0.85 eV. And n=5 would be -13.6 /25, which is -0.544 eV, but maybe rounded to two decimal places as -0.54 eV.

Looking at the options, let me check each one. Option J has E_1 = -13.6eV, that's correct. E2 is -3.4eV, which matches n=2. E3 is -1.51eV, which aligns with 13.6/9 being approximately 1.51. E4 is -0.85eV, which is 13.6/16. And E5 is -0.54eV. So option J must be the correct one. I don't see any other option matching all five values. The other options have different numbers, like option H starts at -6.8, which would be E1 for another atom like helium. Others like option F have E1 at -10eV, which could be for a different formula, but no, hydrogen's E1 is always -13.6. So J is the only one that fits all the values given.

The energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen atom are given by the formula:

\[
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}
\]

where \( n \) is the principal quantum number. Calculating the first five energy levels:

- For \( n = 1 \): \( E_1 = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( E_2 = -3.4 \, \text{eV} \)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( E_3 \approx -1.51 \, \text{eV} \)
- For \( n = 4 \): \( E_4 \approx -0.85 \, \text{eV} \)
- For \( n = 5 \): \( E_5 \approx -0.54 \, \text{eV} \)

Among the options provided, **Option J** matches these calculated values exactly:
- \( E_1 = -13.6 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_2 = -3.4 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_3 = -1.51 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_4 = -0.85 \, \text{eV} \)
- \( E_5 = -0.54 \, \text{eV} \)

Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
