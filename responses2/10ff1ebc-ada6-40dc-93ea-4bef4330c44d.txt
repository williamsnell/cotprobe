Okay, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question about the number of Americans in 1965 who thought sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 45% to 95%. 

Hmm, I remember that during the Vietnam War, a lot of people were concerned about the environment, like how the environment was toxic. So, thinking that sending troops there was a mistake made sense because the environment was really hard to live in. But I'm not sure how accurate that is now, especially since there's also the environmental issue debate in the present day. 

Wait, I think in the 1960s, a significant number of Americans believed that the environment was toxic and that sending troops was a mistake. But wait, maybe it was higher than that. I remember reading somewhere that around 85% thought it was a mistake, but I'm not certain. Or was it higher? I think I've read that a lot, so maybe 85% or so. 

Looking at the options, B is 85% and F is 55%. I'm trying to recall if the majority thought it was a mistake. Oh yeah, I think more than half thought so. So maybe 85% is the correct answer. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up, but I'm pretty sure the majority thought it was a mistake. So the answer should be B: 85%.

The correct answer is B: 85%.
