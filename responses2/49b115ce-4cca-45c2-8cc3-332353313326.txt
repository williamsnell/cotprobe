Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the character played by Woody Allen in the 1967 James Bond film 'Casino Royale'. I'm a bit rusty on my Bond history, but I'll try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that 'Casino Royale' is a James Bond film. I think it's a classic, so I need to recall who the main character was. I'm pretty sure it's a Bond agent, not a regular Bond villain. But who was the agent?

I remember that in some Bond films, the main character is a private agent who works with Bond. The ones I'm thinking of are the ones played by James Bond films, like 'Styx' (1969) where James Bond is the agent, or maybe 'Her' (1973) where he's the agent too. Wait, no, 'Her' is actually about a woman, so that's not it.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. Oh right, I think the character played by Allen in 'Casino Royale' is Little Jimmy Bond. Little Jimmy is the agent who deals with the drug kingpin, and he's the one who bonds with Bond himself. So Little Jimmy is the Bond agent, or agent agent in this case.

Looking at the options, option C is Little Jimmy Bond. So the answer should be C.

I'm a bit confused because I thought the main Bond villain is Dr. Evil, but that's a different character. So Little Jimmy is definitely the agent here.
