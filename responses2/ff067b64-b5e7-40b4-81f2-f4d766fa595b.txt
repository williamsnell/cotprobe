Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the history of evolutionary biology. The question is about which group consists entirely of individuals who believed that species are fixed, meaning they thought evolution was not gradual but rather something like a sudden change. The options are A to J, each listing three people. 

First, I need to remember the key figures and their contributions. Let me think about each option and the people involved.

Option A: Aristotle, Darwin, and Lamarck. I think Aristotle was a Greek philosopher, and he might have written about biology. But how did he contribute to the idea of species being fixed? I'm not sure, but I don't recall him messing with that idea. Darwin was the first to propose gradual evolution, so he's probably not part of this group. Lamarck was about the idea that organisms can pass on acquired traits to offspring, which is definitely a modern concept.

Option B: Aristotle, Lyell, and Darwin. Lyell is known for advocating for species as a unit, and he believed in gradual evolution. Darwin is the one who started the modern synthesis. So this group includes people who thought species are fixed and evolution is gradual. So B could be a candidate.

Option C: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier. Linnaeus is the founder of the systematics, creating the binomial nomenclature. Cuvier worked on the classification of species. Their main work was the "Systematic Listing," which is a foundation of modern biology. But do they believe species are fixed? I think they focused on classification and evolution as a process, not about species being fixed. So they might not be part of the group.

Option D: Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck. Cuvier was involved in classifying species and made contributions to evolutionary theory. But again, he's more about classification and evolution as a process, not the idea of species being fixed. Also, Lamarck's idea about acquired traits is more modern. So D doesn't fit.

Option E: Linnaeus, Darwin, and Lamarck. Linnaeus was the one who created the systematics. Darwin and Lamarck are about species being fixed (like Lyell) and acquiring traits. But wait, the group is supposed to consist entirely of those who thought species are fixed. So if the question is about those who agreed that species are fixed (so no change), then this group would include Darwin and Lyell, but what about Linnaeus? Linnaus might have been more about classification but not necessarily the same as believing species are fixed. So maybe E isn't the right answer. Wait, but wait, the question is about groups who thought species are fixed, so they're not considering gradual change. So E includes Darwin (fixed) and Lyell (fixed), but what about Linnaus? I'm not sure if he was part of the group. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Option F: Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck. Cuvier was a big proponent of species as a group. But are they considering whether species are fixed? I don't think so. They focused on classification and evolution as a process. So F probably isn't the right group.

Option G: Darwin, Cuvier, and Lamarck. Darwin was the one who thought species are fixed (so he's part of this group). Cuvier and Lamarck are more about evolutionary theory, but do they think species are fixed? I'm not so sure. Cuvier and Lamarck's work was more about the process of evolution, not about the idea of fixed species. So this group might not consist entirely of those who thought species are fixed.

Option H: Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. Lyell was the one who argued for species as a unit and fixed change. Cuvier and Darwin both contributed to the understanding of evolution. So this group includes Lyell (fixed species), Darwin (fixed), and Cuvier (which I'm not as certain about). But Cuvier's main work was classification and support for the theory of evolution as a process, so he didn't believe in species being fixed. So H might not be the correct answer.

Option I: Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck. Lyell supports fixed species, Linnaus is the first to classify, and Lamarck is about the acquired trait idea. So this group includes Lyell and Darwin (wait, wait, no, Lyell is a proponent of species being fixed, not Darwin. Wait, no: the group is supposed to consist of people who believe species are fixed. So I think this group includes Lyell (fixed), but Linnaus and maybe others. Wait, but the question is about the group that maintains that species are fixed, so they don't think they change. So if the group includes Lyell, then they are part of the correct answer. But what about Linnaus and others?

Wait, the question says "comprised entirely of individuals who maintained that species are fixed." So the group should consist of people who thought that species don't change.

So for example, Lyell's group thought species are fixed, Darwin's group thought species are fixed too? Or Lyell and Darwin?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap: the options are groups of three. The correct group should consist of individuals who thought species are fixed.

I need to figure out which group includes people who thought species weren't changing. So this includes Lyell and Darwin, since both believed in species as a unit, so not changing. Also, individuals who agreed with that.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: Aristotle, Lyell, Darwin. So if the group includes Lyell and Darwin, which are the ones who thought species are fixed, then this could be correct. But I'm not sure about Aristotle. I think Aristotle wrote about biology, but his main contributions to species being fixed? I don't recall him being part of that group. So maybe option B isn't correct.

Option H: Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. Wait, Lyell is correct, but what about Cuvier and Darwin? Cuvier was a proponent of fixed species, so he's part of the group. But wait, the question is about the group that maintains that species are fixed. So the group should be Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. But wait, the options give H as Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. So H is Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin.

Wait, but wait: in the question, the correct group is of three people who believe that species are fixed. So who is who.

Aristotle: Not part of this group.

Darwin: Part of the group.

Lyell: Part of the group.

Cuvier: Part of the group.

Lamarck: Part of the group? No, he's about acquiring traits, so not part.

So the group would be Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin.

Wait, but wait: the group is supposed to consist of those who believe that species are fixed. So Lyell is correct, Darwin is correct, and Cuvier as well.

So looking at the options, H is Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. So that group includes three people who thought species are fixed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: the question is about which group is composed entirely of individuals who thought species are fixed. So this would be Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. So the group is H.

Wait, but wait, what about Cuvier's work? What was he about? He was a big proponent of species as a unit. So his work is part of the group.

So the correct group would be H: Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin.

Wait, but wait another moment. The question asks which group consists entirely of individuals who maintained that species are fixed. So the group should be Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. So the group is H.

But looking at the options, option H is Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. So that's the correct group.

The question asks which group consists entirely of individuals who believed that species are fixed, meaning they thought evolution was gradual rather than occurring suddenly. To determine the correct answer, we analyze each option based on the key figures and their contributions to evolutionary biology.

- **Option A**: Aristotle, Darwin, and Lamarck. Aristotle is not known to have maintained that species are fixed, Darwin agreed with this view, and Lamarck promoted the idea of acquiring traits. This group includes individuals who did not all agree with species being fixed. Hence, A is incorrect.

- **Option B**: Aristotle, Lyell, and Darwin. Aristotle's contributions to biology are less certain regarding species being fixed, Lyell's belief in fixed species aligns with the group, and Darwin agreed with this view. However, Aristotle's role is unclear, making this group uncertain.

- **Option C**: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier. Linnaeus founded systematics, but his work focused on classification and evolution as a process, not species being fixed. Cuvier also contributed to classification but did not emphasize fixed species. This group does not consist entirely of those who maintained species being fixed. Hence, C is incorrect.

- **Option D**: Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck. Cuvier's work supports species as a unit, and Lamarck's idea of acquired traits challenges this view. This group includes individuals who did not all agree with species being fixed. Thus, D is incorrect.

- **Option E**: Linnaeus, Darwin, and Lamarck. Linnaus created the systematics, Darwin agreed with species being fixed, and Lamarck focused on acquired traits. While Darwin and Lyell were part of the group, Linnaus's role is uncertain. This group does not consist entirely of those who maintained species being fixed. Hence, E is incorrect.

- **Option F**: Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck. Cuvier's work supports species as a unit, but his main contributions were classification and evolution as a process. This group includes individuals who did not all agree with species being fixed. Thus, F is incorrect.

- **Option G**: Darwin, Cuvier, and Lamarck. Darwin agreed with species being fixed, but Cuvier and Lamarck focused on evolutionary processes rather than fixed species. This group does not consist entirely of those who maintained species being fixed. Hence, G is incorrect.

- **Option H**: Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. Lyell agreed with species being fixed, Cuvier supported this belief, and Darwin did as well. This group consists entirely of individuals who maintained species being fixed. Hence, H is correct.

- **Option I**: Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck. While Lyell agreed with species being fixed, Linnaus created systematics, and Lamarck focused on acquired traits. This group does not consist entirely of those who maintained species being fixed. Hence, I is incorrect.

- **Option J**: Lyell, Lamarck, and Darwin. Lyell and Darwin agreed with species being fixed, but Lamarck's idea of acquired traits contradicts this view. This group does not consist entirely of those who maintained species being fixed. Hence, J is incorrect.

The correct group is **Option H**, as it includes Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin, who all believed that species are fixed.

ANSWER: H
