Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a gas thermometer and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is a constant-volume perfect gas thermometer. At the triple point temperature of water, which is 273.16 K, the pressure is 6.69 kPa. The question is asking what change in pressure indicates a change of 1.00 K at this temperature.

Hmm, I remember that a perfect gas thermometer measures temperature by the change in pressure at constant volume. Oh wait, right, because according to Charles's Law, V is constant, so P is directly proportional to T. So the pressure should be proportional to temperature when volume is fixed.

So, in this case, since the volume is constant, the pressure should increase linearly with temperature. The triple point is where the pressure and temperature are known, so maybe I can find the slope of the pressure-T relationship and then use that to find the pressure change per Kelvin.

Wait, the triple point is a specific point where pressure and temperature are defined. So the pressure is P0 = 6.69 kPa at T0 = 273.16 K. If the volume is constant, then the slope of P vs T would be ΔP/ΔT.

But wait, since it's a perfect gas, the ideal gas law applies. So P1 V = n R T1 and P2 V = n R T2. Since V is constant, P1/T1 = P2/T2. So, the change in pressure for a given change in temperature is (P2 - P1)/ΔT.

Let me think. Since the temperature change is 1 K, the change in pressure would be (P2 - P1) = (ΔP) = (P2 - P1) = (ΔP/ΔT) * ΔT. But here, the change is for ΔT=1 K, so ΔP = slope * 1 K = (slope) *1 K.

Wait, but what's the slope of P vs T for this perfect gas? The slope is (P2 - P1)/(T2 - T1). Since it's a perfect gas, but at the triple point, this slope would be determined by the equation.

Alternatively, at triple point, the slope is (P2 - P1) / (ΔT). Since they're asking for a 1 K change, the pressure change would be the slope multiplied by 1 K.

Wait, but wait, the triple point is a specific condition. So, if I have a change in temperature of 1 K, the pressure would change by (slope) * 1 K. But I need to find that slope.

Alternatively, since the slope is (P2 - P1) / (T2 - T1), and we know P1 and T1 (the triple point). Since T2 and P2 are the same as T1 and P1 when T is triple point, but no, wait, I'm trying to find the slope based on this given condition.

Wait no, no. The problem states that at the triple point, P is 6.69 kPa and T is 273.16 K. Now, suppose I have a pressure change ΔP when the temperature changes by ΔT=1 K. I need to find ΔP.

Wait, but the ideal gas law: P1 V = n R T1 and P2 V = n R T2. So rearranging, P1 / T1 = P2 / T2.

So, P2 = P1 * T2 / T1.

Change in pressure, ΔP = P2 - P1 = P1 (T2 - T1)/T1 = P1 * (ΔT)/T1.

Wait, but wait, the question is about a change of 1 K. So, the change in pressure when the temperature increases by 1 K is (P1 * (ΔT)) / T1. But, wait, in this problem, the initial temperature is the triple point. So, when the temperature increases by 1 K, the pressure increases by (P triple point) * (1 K) / (273.16 K).

So, ΔP = 6.69 kPa * (1 K) / 273.16 K.

Wait, but that would give the fractional change, so I might need to multiply by 1 K to get the actual change.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. So, P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1). So P2 - P1 = P1 (T2 - T1)/T1 = P1 * (ΔT) / T1.

So, if we have ΔT = 1 K, then ΔP = (P1 * 1 K) / T1.

So, substituting the numbers: P1 = 6.69 kPa, T1 = 273.16 K.

So, ΔP = 6.69 * 1 / 273.16 = approximately 0.0245 kPa.

Wait, let me calculate that. 6.69 divided by 273.16... 273.16 is roughly 273.16. So 273.16 * 0.0245 is about 6.69.

Wait, let me do the division more accurately. 273.16 into 6.69.

Let me compute 6.69 / 273.16.

273.16 is about 273.16. So 6.69 ÷ 273.16.

Well, 273.16 * 0.0245 = let's see. 273.16 * 0.02 is 5.4632. 0.0045 is 273.16 * 0.0045 = let's calculate 273 * 0.0045 = 1.2285, and 0.16 *0.0045=0.00072. So, 1.23 + 0.00072 = 1.23072. So 0.0245 * 273.16 =5.4632 + 1.23072=6.69392. Which is just over 6.69. So 0.0245 is approximately 6.69392/273.16, which is 6.69392 / 273.16 = 0.0245 approx.

Wait, but wait, wait. So 273.16 * 0.0245 is approximately 6.69392, which is 6.694. So 6.69 / 273.16 is 0.0245 approximately.

So, ΔP = 0.0245 kPa.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option C is 0.0245 kPa. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the pressure is proportional to temperature. So, the ratio of the two pressures is equal to the ratio of temperatures.

So, P2 = P1 * T2 / T1.

ΔP = P2 - P1 = P1 (T2 - T1)/ T1 = P1 (ΔT)/ T1.

Which is exactly as I calculated earlier.

So, 6.69 * (1 K) / 273.16 K = 6.69 / 273.16 kPa.

Which is approximately 0.0245 kPa.

So the correct change is 0.0245 kPa, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between pressure and temperature for a constant-volume perfect gas, which is given by Charles's Law: \( P \propto T \). At the triple point of water, the pressure is \( P_1 = 6.69 \, \mathrm{kPa} \) and the temperature is \( T_1 = 273.16 \, \mathrm{K} \). For a small change in temperature \( \Delta T = 1 \, \mathrm{K} \), the corresponding change in pressure \( \Delta P \) can be calculated using the ratio \( \frac{P_1}{T_1} \), since \( P \propto T \).

The change in pressure is:

\[
\Delta P = P_1 \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\Delta P = 6.69 \, \mathrm{kPa} \cdot \frac{1 \, \mathrm{K}}{273.16 \, \mathrm{K}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{6.69}{273.16} \, \mathrm{kPa} \approx 0.0245 \, \mathrm{kPa}
\]

Thus, the change in pressure for a \( 1 \, \mathrm{K} \) change in temperature is approximately \( 0.0245 \, \mathrm{kPa} \). Comparing this result with the answer options, the correct choice is:

**C: 0.0245 kPa**
