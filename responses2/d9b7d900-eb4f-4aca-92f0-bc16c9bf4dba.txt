Okay, so I've got this question here about balloons and packages. Let me read it again. It says balloons come in packages of 8, and I need 42 balloons. The question is, how many packages should I buy? The options are A through J, with numbers like 5, 12, 6, 7, etc.

Hmm, so balloons per package are 8. I need 42. So I need to figure out how many 8s make 42. That sounds like division. Let me think, 8 times 5 is 40, and 8 times 6 is 48. Oh wait, 48 is more than 42. So 5 packages would give me 40, which is not enough. I need 42, so I can't just do 5. Then 6 packages give 48, which is more than 42. But wait, the options have 6 as option C. So is 6 the correct answer?

Wait, let me double-check. 8 * 5 = 40, which is less than 42. So 5 isn't enough. 8 * 6 is 48, which is more than 42. So that's the minimum number of packages needed. So the answer should be 6, which is option C.

The correct answer is 6 packages, as 6 Ã— 8 = 48, which is the smallest number of balloons exceeding 42.

Answer: C
