Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the standard enthalpy of formation for DyCl3 from s. The question gives me three reactions with their ΔH° values. I remember that to find ΔfH°, I need to relate the given reactions to the formation reaction.

The target reaction is the formation of DyCl3 as a solid, right? So the reactant is solid Dy and reacting with HCl aqueous to form DyCl3 aqueous and H2 gas.

Looking at the given data:

1. DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq) in 4.0 M HCl. ΔH° is -180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹. Hmm, this is like a solution formation reaction. So that's probably the dissolution reaction, but wait, no, it's the reverse. Because if the solid dissolves to form the aqueous solution.

Wait, wait. Let me think. No, reaction (1) is DyCl3(s) going to DyCl3(aq). The ΔH is -180.06, which means it's exothermic. But DyCl3(s) is the reactant; the product is aqueous. So this is the reverse of the formation reaction. So the formation reaction would be the opposite. So the formation reaction would be DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s) + something. So we'd need to reverse reaction (1). So the ΔH for that would be +180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But wait, let me confirm. The formation reaction is usually written as a solid reactant and the product is the compound in its standard state. So DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq), but I think that's a solution, not the pure solid anymore. So the standard enthalpy of formation for DyCl3(s) would have to involve the dissolution.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this step by step.

The formation reaction is Dy(s) + 3/2 H2(g) → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2O(g). Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention H2O. Maybe the given reactions don't include water, so perhaps the HCl aqueous is the solution, but the final product is DyCl3 in aqueous, not in solution as water. Wait, but the problem says it's in aqueous HCl. So perhaps the solution isn't the final product, but it's a step in the formation.

Wait, the question is about the standard enthalpy of formation of DyCl3(s). The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

So DyCl3(s) is the compound. So the reaction to form it would involve breaking the bonds of Dy(s) and Cl3^3-(s), but the given reactions are about the dissolution and the HCl solution.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how to express the formation reaction using the given reactions.

The given reaction (2) is Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq) → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2(g). The ΔH for this is -699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹. So that's the dissolution of solid Dy into aqueous solution, producing DyCl3 aqueous and H2 gas.

Reaction (3): ½ H2(g) + ½ Cl2(g) → HCl(aq, 4.0 M). The ΔH is -158.31 kJ/mol⁻¹. That's the standard formation of HCl aqueous from H2 and Cl2. So that's the reverse of reaction (1), because reaction (1) is DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq), which is the reverse of reaction (2).

Wait, so reaction (1) is the dissolution of DyCl3(s) into aqueous, which would be the reverse of reaction (2). So reaction (1) is DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s) + ΔH = +180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹.

So now, I need to find a way to combine reaction (2) and reaction (3) to get the formation of DyCl3(s).

Let me write down the target formation reaction:

Dy(s) + 3/2 H2(g) → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2O(g) ? No, hold on. Wait, in the given reactions, reaction (3) involves HCl, not water. So perhaps the HCl solution is the same as aqueous HCl, but I'm not sure how that affects the final product.

Wait, perhaps the formation reaction is the reverse of reaction (2). Because in reaction (2), Dy(s) is reacting to form DyCl3(aq), but DyCl3(s) is the product. So the reverse of reaction (2) would be DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + ... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the overall process. Let's see: the formation reaction is the combining of elements into the compound.

Let me think about the three given reactions:

Reaction (1): DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq), ΔH = -180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹ (so this is exothermic, meaning it's forming the aqueous form from solid.)

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq) → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2(g), ΔH = -699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Reaction (3): ½ H2(g) + ½ Cl2(g) → HCl(aq), ΔH = -158.31 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Wait, reaction (3) is the formation of HCl from H2 and Cl2. So if I have 1 mole of HCl, that's 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole Cl2? Wait, reaction (3) is written as ½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl, so the coefficients would be 1 mole HCl.

So if I take reaction (3) and multiply by 2 to get 1 mole HCl, the equation becomes:

H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2 HCl(aq), ΔH = 2*(-158.31) = -316.62 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But reaction (2) is: Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq) → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2(g), ΔH = -699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Hmm. So I need to find a way to combine these. Let's see.

If I take reaction (2) and subtract reaction (3)*2, perhaps.

Wait, reaction (2) is: Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2.

If I subtract 2*(reaction 3), which is 2H2 + 2Cl2 → 2 HCl(aq), ΔH = -316.62 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But since reaction (3) is the formation of HCl, subtracting it would be adding the reverse reaction. So subtracting reaction (3) multiplied by 2 would be adding HCl from H2 and Cl2.

So let me write the steps.

I want to find the formation of DyCl3(s). So the overall reaction is:

Dy(s) + 3/2 H2(g) → DyCl3(s)

Which is the same as Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 → DyCl3(s).

So how can I get this from the given reactions?

Let me think. I have reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2.

Reaction (3)*2: H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl(aq), ΔH = -316.62 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But wait, I can reverse reaction (2). Because that would give DyCl3(aq) reacting back to Dy(s) and H2.

Wait, let's reverse reaction (2):

DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2 → Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq). The ΔH would be +699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

So now, I have:

3/2 H2 + DyCl3 → Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq), ΔH = +699.43.

Now, what if I add this to reaction (3) multiplied by 3/2? Because the HCl in this new reaction is 3 HCl, and reaction (3) times 3/2 would have 3 HCl as the product.

Wait, reaction (3) is ½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl, so multiplying by 3 gives:

3*(½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl) → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl.

So the reverse of that would be:

3 HCl → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2, ΔH = +316.62 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to proceed. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract reaction (3) from reaction (2) multiplied by certain factors.

Wait, let me think about combining reaction (2) and reaction (3). Let me write the equations:

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq) → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2(g) ΔH = -699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Reaction (3): ½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl(aq) ΔH = -158.31 kJ/mol⁻¹.

I want to eliminate HCl and H2 to get DyCl3(s) and Dy(s).

Wait, perhaps if I subtract reaction (3) from reaction (2), but scaled appropriately.

Wait, let's try to get rid of HCl and H2.

Multiply reaction (3) by 6 to get 3 H2 and 3 Cl2 as products, and 6 HCl.

But I'm not sure. Let me think: perhaps I can adjust the equations to cancel out HCl and H2.

Let me try to combine reaction (2) and reaction (3) in a way that would eliminate HCl and H2.

Let me write the target formation as:

Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 → DyCl3(s).

So how can I get from the given reactions (1), (2), and (3) to this?

Wait, let me consider how to get DyCl3(s) from the given reactions.

Reaction (1) gives DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq), which is the reverse of what we need. So if I have the reverse of reaction (1), then I can get DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s). But the given reaction (1) has a ΔH of -180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹, which means the reverse would be +180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Then, if I can represent the formation of DyCl3(s) as the reverse of reaction (2), plus reaction (3) multiplied by 3/2?

Wait, perhaps.

Let me write:

Formation of DyCl3(s) = Reverse of reaction (2) + 3*( reaction (3) to get HCl from H2 and Cl2) ?

Wait, let me think in terms of equations:

Reverse of reaction (2): DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2(g), ΔH = +699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Reaction (3): ½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl(aq), ΔH = -158.31 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Suppose I take 3*(reaction (3)): 3*(½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl) → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl.

But that's not directly useful. Alternatively, let's consider:

If I take 3*(reaction (3)), the reaction becomes:

3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl.

Now, if I add this to the reverse of reaction (2), I get:

DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(s).

Wait, no. Because the reverse reaction (2) is DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

Adding reaction (3)*3 → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl.

So adding reaction (3)*3 to the reverse reaction (2):

DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 → (reverse of reaction (2) is DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2, so when I subtract reaction (2), I'm not sure.)

Wait, maybe more accurately:

Reverse reaction (2): DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 → ΔH = +699.43.

Reaction (3)*3: 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl(aq) → ΔH = 3*(-158.31) =-474.93 kJ/mol⁻¹.

So when I add these two reactions together, I get:

DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 + 3 HCl(aq).

Simplify the equation by subtracting 3/2 H2 from both sides:

DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 Cl2 → Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq).

Which is:

DyCl3(aq) + Cl2(g) → Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq).

Hmm, but the target is to get DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2(g).

Wait, from this equation, perhaps subtract another reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can reverse this to get DyCl3(s).

Wait, let's see. The equation after adding the two reactions is:

DyCl3(aq) + Cl2(g) → Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq).

If I reverse this equation:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq) → DyCl3(aq) + Cl2(g).

But from reaction (2), we know that Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2.

If I subtract this from the reversed equation I just had:

(Dy(s) + 3 HCl(aq) → DyCl3(aq) + Cl2(g)) – (Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2)).

Wait, perhaps that would cancel some terms.

Wait, let me write the two equations:

Equation A: DyCl3(aq) + Cl2 → Dy(s) + 3 HCl.

Equation B: Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2.

If I subtract Equation B from Equation A, I get:

DyCl3(aq) + Cl2 - DyCl3(aq) - 3 HCl → Dy(s) + 3 HCl - Dy(s) - 3 HCl.

Wait, that simplifies to:

Cl2 - 3 HCl → 0.

Which is:

Cl2 → 3 HCl.

Which is not correct, because that would imply that Cl2 is converted into 3 HCl.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

We have target: Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 → DyCl3(s).

The given reactions are:

1. DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq); ΔH = -180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹ (so the reverse is +180.06).

2. Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2; ΔH = -699.43.

3. ½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl; ΔH = -158.31.

So perhaps I can use reaction (2), and manipulate it to get the target.

Reaction (2) is: Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2.

If I take reaction (2) and subtract reaction (3)*3, I can get DyCl3(s).

Wait, let's see. Let me multiply reaction (3) by 3 to get 3 HCl as product.

Reaction (3) * 3: 3*(½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl) → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl.

Now, take reaction (2) and subtract this from it.

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2.

Reaction (3)*3: 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl.

Subtract reaction (3)*3 from reaction (2):

Dy(s) + 3 HCl - (3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl) → Dy(s) + 3 HCl - (3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2) → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2 - (3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2) → DyCl3(aq) - 3/2 Cl2.

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the following approach:

We want to get DyCl3(s) from reaction (2) and reaction (3).

Let me think about the target reaction: Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 → DyCl3(s).

So, to get this, we can reverse reaction (2), but that gives DyCl3(aq) as the reactant. Then, we can add the reverse of reaction (3), which is 3 HCl → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The target is:

Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 → DyCl3(s).

Which can be written as:

DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

So, the reverse of this is the formation of DyCl3(s) from its elements.

Now, what's the way to form DyCl3(s) from the given reactions.

Looking at the given reactions, reaction (1) is the dissolution of DyCl3(s) into aqueous solution. So to get DyCl3(s), we could take the reverse of reaction (1).

But reaction (1) has ΔH = -180.06, so its reverse has ΔH = +180.06. So reaction (1)*: DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s), ΔH = +180.06.

Now, to get from DyCl3(aq) to DyCl3(s), we can use reaction (1)*.

But the target formation is DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

So how do we get from DyCl3(aq) to Dy(s) + 3/2 H2?

Looking at the given reactions (2) and (3), perhaps we can combine them.

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2.

If I reverse reaction (2), I get DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2. The ΔH for this reversed reaction is +699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Now, I can take reaction (3): ½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl, ΔH = -158.31.

But to get HCl from H2 and Cl2, perhaps I can multiply reaction (3) by 3 to get 3 HCl.

So reaction (3)*3: 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl, ΔH = 3*(-158.31) = -474.93 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Now, if I take the reversed reaction (2) (ΔH = +699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹) and add reaction (3)*3 (ΔH = -474.93), I can get the net ΔH.

So:

ΔH_total = (+699.43) + (-474.93) = 224.5 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Wait, but the target formation is DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2, which is the reverse of reaction (2)'s reversed reaction.

Wait, no. Let me think. The reversed reaction (2) is DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2, ΔH=+699.43.

If I add this reversed reaction (2) to reaction (3)*3, I get:

DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2

plus

3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl

Which together: DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 Cl2 → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 + 3 HCl.

But the target formation is DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again about combining the given reactions.

Another approach: Combine reaction (2) and reaction (3)*3. Let's see.

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2, ΔH = -699.43.

Reaction (3)*3: 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl, ΔH = -474.93.

If I add reaction (2) and reaction (3)*3, I get:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2 + 3 HCl.

But 3/2 H2 and 3 HCl cancel out from both sides.

So, we are left with:

Dy(s) + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(aq).

Wait, but that's not the target. The target is DyCl3(s).

So perhaps I can take the reverse of this new equation.

DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 Cl2, ΔH = +474.93 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Hmm, but I'm not making progress towards the target.

Wait, perhaps I should instead subtract reaction (3)*3 from reaction (2).

Reaction (2) minus reaction (3)*3 equals:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl - (3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl) → Dy(s) + 3 HCl - (3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2) → Dy(s) - 3/2 H2 - 3/2 Cl2 + DyCl3(aq).

Wait, that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps another approach: To get DyCl3(s), I need to go from DyCl3(aq), which is the dissolution product, back to the elements.

So, perhaps I can use reaction (1)*, which is DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s), ΔH = +180.06.

But to get DyCl3(s), I need to combine reaction (1)* with another reaction that produces DyCl3(aq) from its components.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the given data again.

The given reactions are:

1. DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq), ΔH = -180.06 kJ/mol⁻¹.

2. Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2, ΔH = -699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

3. ½ H2 + ½ Cl2 → HCl, ΔH = -158.31 kJ/mol⁻¹.

So, perhaps I can use reaction (2) and reaction (3)*3 to get DyCl3(s).

Wait, let me try combining reaction (2) and (3)*3.

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2, ΔH = -699.43.

Reaction (3)*3: 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl, ΔH = -474.93.

Adding these together:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2 + 3 HCl.

Simplify by subtracting 3/2 H2 and 3 HCl from both sides:

Dy(s) + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(aq).

But the target is DyCl3(s), so I need to reverse this.

So, the reverse would be DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 Cl2, ΔH = +474.93 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But that's not the same as the target.

Wait, perhaps I can add reaction (3)*3 to reaction (2) to get DyCl3(aq) and then add the reverse of reaction (1)*.

Wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take reaction (2) and reaction (3)*3 and subtract them.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I can't find the correct combination of reactions to get the target.

Let me try another approach. The target is DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

So, the reverse is DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

Which is the same as DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

But how can I get DyCl3(aq) from the given reactions?

Looking at the given reactions, reaction (2) gives DyCl3(aq) as a product when Dy(s) is reacted with HCl.

So, perhaps I can take reaction (2) and subtract reaction (3)*3.

Wait, perhaps adding reaction (2) and reaction (3)*3 would give DyCl3(aq) and other products.

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use reaction (1)* and reaction (3)*3.

Reaction (1)*: DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s), ΔH = +180.06.

Reaction (3)*3: 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl, ΔH = -474.93.

So, if I add these two reactions, I get:

DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2.

Which can be rearranged as:

DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq) - 3/2 H2 - 3/2 Cl2.

But I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the reverse of reaction (3)*3, which is 3 HCl → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2, ΔH=474.93.

Then, reacting this with reaction (1)*, which is DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s), ΔH=+180.06.

Adding the two reactions:

DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2.

Which can be rearranged as:

DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq) - 3/2 H2 - 3/2 Cl2.

But I'm not getting closer to the target.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the target formation as the reverse of reaction (2), but I need to account for reaction (3)*3.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to take reaction (2), subtract reaction (3)*3, and then the reverse.

Wait, let me try that.

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2, ΔH = -699.43 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Subtracting reaction (3)*3 from reaction (2):

So, Dy(s) + 3 HCl - (3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl) → Dy(s) + 3 HCl - 3/2 H2 - 3/2 Cl2 + DyCl3(aq).

Which simplifies to:

DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq) + Dy(s) + 3 HCl - 3/2 H2 - 3/2 Cl2.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach here.

Let me try to think about combining reaction (2) and reaction (3)*3 in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can combine reaction (2) and reaction (3)*3 in such a way that I cancel some terms.

Wait, let me write the equations again.

Reaction (2):

Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2.

Reaction (3)*3:

3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → 3 HCl.

Now, if I add these two reactions together, I get:

Dy(s) + 3 HCl + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2 + 3 HCl.

Simplifying by subtracting 3/2 H2 and 3 HCl from both sides:

Dy(s) + 3/2 Cl2 → DyCl3(aq).

But the target is DyCl3(s), so I need to reverse this equation.

Thus:

DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 Cl2.

ΔH for this reverse reaction is +474.93 kJ/mol⁻¹.

But that's not the same as the target, which is DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I can use reaction (1)* and the reverse of reaction (3)*3.

Reaction (1)*: DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s), ΔH = +180.06.

Reverse of reaction (3)*3: 3 HCl → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2, ΔH=+474.93.

Adding these two reactions:

DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s) + 3 HCl.

3 HCl → 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2.

Adding them gives:

DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s) + 3/2 H2 + 3/2 Cl2.

Which can be rearranged as:

DyCl3(s) → DyCl3(aq) - 3/2 H2 - 3/2 Cl2.

But I'm not sure how this helps me reach the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck because I can't find the right combination of reactions to get the target.

Wait, but perhaps I can think of the target in terms of the given reactions, and figure out how to get there.

The target is DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

So, perhaps I can think of this as Dy(s) + 3/2 H2 → DyCl3(s).

Which is the reverse of reaction (2), but I need to account for reaction (3)*3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the target as the reverse of reaction (2), plus reaction (3)*3.

Wait, but that might not make sense.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the target as the reverse of reaction (2), plus reaction (3)*3, but that would affect the enthalpy.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the target as the reverse of reaction (2), but the reverse of reaction (2) is DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2, which is the reverse of reaction (2).

But that's not the target.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the target as the reverse of reaction (2), but I need to account for reaction (3)*3.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the target as the reverse of reaction (2), but I have to add reaction (3)*3.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the enthalpy.

The target is DyCl3(s) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2.

The reverse of reaction (2) is DyCl3(aq) → Dy(s) + 3/2 H2, ΔH = +699.43.

But that's not the target.

Wait, but perhaps I can subtract reaction (3)*3 from this.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the formation of DyCl3(s) from the given reactions.

To form DyCl3(s), I need to go from DyCl3(aq) to DyCl3(s), which is reaction (1)*, ΔH = +180.06.

But how do I get DyCl3(aq) from the given reactions?

Looking at the given reactions, reaction (2) gives DyCl3(aq) as a product when Dy(s) reacts with HCl.

So, perhaps I can write:

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2, ΔH = -699.43.

If I can isolate DyCl3(aq) from reaction (2), perhaps by adding reaction (1)* to reaction (2).

Wait, let me try that.

Adding reaction (1)* and reaction (2):

Reaction (1)*: DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s), ΔH = +180.06.

Reaction (2): Dy(s) + 3 HCl → DyCl3(aq) + 3/2 H2, ΔH = -699.43.

Adding these two reactions:

DyCl3(aq) → DyCl3(s) + Dy(s) + 3 HCl + 3/2 H2.

But this gives DyCl3(aq) as a reactant, which we don't want.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract reaction (3)*3 from reaction (2).

Wait, subtracting reaction (3)*3 from reaction (2) would mean adding their ΔH.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the target as the reverse of reaction (2) minus reaction (3)*3.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the target as the reverse of reaction (2), but I have to account for reaction (3)*3.
