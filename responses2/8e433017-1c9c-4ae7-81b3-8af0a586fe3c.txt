Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about identifying the type of marketing research firm that's conducting a complete marketing research project from data collection, analysis, and reporting. The options are A through J, each offering different kinds of firms.

Hmm, I remember that marketing research can be categorized into different types. From what I recall, a full-service marketing research firm does all the work from start to finish. They collect data, analyze it, and then report it. So they handle everything from surveys to reports, right?

Looking at the options, option A is a data collection firm. That's one part, but it doesn't cover analysis or reporting. Option B is a freelance agency, which is more about providing services on an hourly or project basis, not necessarily a full suite of work. Option C is data analysis, but that's just one step. Option D is a survey firm, which is more about conducting surveys. Option E is a full-service agency, which could imply all services, but I think that's more about providing comprehensive services rather than just marketing research. Option F is tabulation, which is more about organizing data, not necessarily the entire research process. Option G is a marketing agency, which might be more focused on marketing strategies, but I'm not sure if that's the right fit. Option H is a research firm, which sounds like it could handle the research part. Option I is a consultant, which is more for expert advice rather than full projects. Option J is a field agency, which likely focuses on fieldwork, not research.

Wait, the question says the firm contracts to conduct a complete marketing research project. That means they're doing all the steps: data collection, analysis, and reporting. A full-service agency (option E) seems to fit because they handle all aspects, not just one. Alternatively, a marketing agency (G) could be part of that, but maybe a full-service agency is more comprehensive.

So, I'm leaning towards option E as the correct answer. They're not just doing one part; they're doing the whole from start to finish.
