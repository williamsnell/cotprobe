Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about events where groups of sellers meet to attract buyers. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about events where sellers meet collectively to attract buyers. The options are A to J, each representing a different type of event. I need to figure out which one fits the description.

First, I'll look at each option and see what they involve. 

Option A: Direct mail campaigns. That's more about distributing materials in person. Not a group meeting, so probably not the answer.

Option B: Teleconferencing. That's live video calls, so maybe meetings but not a group gathering.

Option C: Sales promotions. I think promotions could involve salespeople meeting with customers, but are they all about attracting buyers? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Option D: Public relations activities. These involve companies engaging with the public, like press conferences or media ads. That might involve meetings with key personnel, but is it specifically about gathering sellers to meet and attract buyers?

Option E: Press conference. That's a specific event where a company or individual is presented with a press release. It's about attracting attention, but is it a group meeting of sellers?

Option F: Mass media advertising. Similar to press conferences, it's about reaching a broad audience. Again, more about reaching rather than a group meeting of sellers.

Option G: Product launches. These are events where a product is introduced to the market. They usually have a lot of press and meetings with stakeholders. This seems to fit because sellers (probably the companies or brands) are meeting to introduce the product, which could attract buyers.

Option H: Market research. This is about gathering data to understand market trends. It might involve meetings but perhaps more about analysis than gathering sellers to meet directly.

Option I: Exhibitions. These are events where products or companies are displayed, often for sale. They're more about showcasing products, not necessarily gathering meetings to attract buyers.

Option J: Social media campaigns. These involve using platforms like Facebook, Instagram to promote products or ideas. They can reach a wide audience, but not necessarily through meetings.

So, putting it together, product launches (Option G) are events where sellers (or companies) meet to introduce the product to the market. This likely involves gathering buyers because selling the product is the main goal. The other options either involve more about media exposure, press meetings, or direct sales, but not necessarily group meetings of sellers to attract buyers.

The correct answer is **G: Product launches**, as these events involve groups meeting to introduce products, attracting potential buyers.

Answer: G
