Okay, so I have this probability question here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what it's asking.

The question is: What is the probability that a randomly selected integer in the set {1,2,3,…,100} is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3? I need to express the answer as a common fraction.

Alright, so the set is all integers from 1 to 100. I need to find how many numbers in this set are divisible by 2 but not by 3. Then, the probability would be that count divided by 100.

First, let's find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 2. Divisible by 2 means even numbers. So, from 2 to 100, stepping by 2. How many terms are there?

Well, 100 divided by 2 is 50. So there are 50 numbers divisible by 2. That's straightforward.

But now, from these 50 numbers, I need to subtract the ones that are also divisible by 3 because those are the numbers we don't want—those divisible by both 2 and 3. Because the question says "divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3," so we're excluding the ones that are divisible by both.

Wait, but that's not exactly right. The problem says "divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3." So, the count is numbers divisible by 2 minus numbers divisible by both 2 and 3.

So, I need to find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by both 2 and 3. But wait, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 are exactly the numbers divisible by the least common multiple of 2 and 3. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. So, numbers divisible by 6.

So, how many numbers in 1 to 100 are divisible by 6? Let's calculate that. 100 divided by 6 is approximately 16.666. So, the integer part is 16. So, there are 16 numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 6.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. 6 times 16 is 96, and 6 times 17 is 102, which is beyond 100. So, yes, 16 numbers.

So, the count of numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3 is the total divisible by 2 (50) minus the numbers divisible by 6 (16). That gives 50 - 16 = 34.

Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure. Another approach: numbers divisible by 2 not divisible by 3 can be found by subtracting those divisible by both 2 and 3 from those divisible by 2. Yes, that's correct.

So, 50 - 16 = 34. So, there are 34 numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 2 but not by 3.

Wait, but let me verify this with another method. Because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, the count of numbers divisible by 2 is 50 as before. The count of numbers divisible by 3 is 33 (since 100 divided by 3 is approximately 33.333, so 33 numbers). But we need those divisible by 2 and not by 3. So, it's the count of numbers divisible by 2 minus those divisible by both, which is again 50 - (numbers divisible by both 2 and 3). Numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 are the same as divisible by 6, which is 16.

So, 50 - 16 is 34. So, 34 numbers. That gives a probability of 34/100, which simplifies to 17/50. Wait, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A: 17/31
B: 33/66
C: 33/100
D: 17/50
E: 1/6
F: 17/66
G: 1/3
H: 31/66
I: 31/100
J: 17/100

So, 34/100 simplifies to 17/50. But wait, the options don't have 34/100, but option D is 17/50. So, that's an option.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought 34/100 simplifies to 17/50. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my initial reasoning. Maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this with another method. Let's count numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3.

Numbers divisible by 2: 50 numbers (2,4,6,...,100).

From these, subtract the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3, which are the numbers divisible by 6.

Numbers divisible by 6: let's compute 100 divided by 6, which is approximately 16.666. So, 16 numbers (6,12,18,...,96). That's 16 numbers.

So, 50 - 16 = 34 numbers. So, 34 numbers are divisible by 2 but not by 3.

So, the probability is 34/100, which reduces to 17/50. So, the answer should be D: 17/50.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 17/50, yes. So, that's the answer.

But wait, let me think again. What if I count the numbers not divisible by 3, and then see how many are even.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as the count of numbers divisible by 2, not divisible by 3.

Which is the same as numbers divisible by 2 minus those divisible by 6.

Yes, that's the same as before, 50 - 16 = 34. So, 34/100 = 17/50.

So, the correct answer is D: 17/50.
</think>

The number of integers between 1 and 100 divisible by 2 is 50. The numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., by 6) are 16. Subtracting these, 50 - 16 = 34 numbers are divisible by 2 but not by 3. Thus, the probability is 34/100, which simplifies to 17/50.
