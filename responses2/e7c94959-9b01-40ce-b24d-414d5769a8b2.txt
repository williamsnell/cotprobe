Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the normality of a solution. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says: Calculate the normality of a solution 40 mL required to neutralize 0.56 g of KOH. The options are A through J, with various N values.

Wait, normality (N) is a measure of concentration used particularly for solutions of reactions where the equivalent is involved, like in titrations. I remember that normality is calculated as the number of equivalents of solute per liter of solution.

So, KOH is a strong base, so it would react with an acid. The reaction would probably be KOH + HCl → KCl + H2O, but the specifics might not matter here. What matters is the number of equivalents each mole of KOH contributes.

KOH is a strong base, so each mole of KOH can react with H+ from an acid. For example, HCl is a strong acid and provides one H+ per mole. So, for each mole of KOH, you need one mole of HCl to neutralize it. But wait, since we're dealing with normality, I should think about the equivalents.

Each mole of KOH is equivalent to one mole in terms of being a base. So, the normality is calculated by taking the number of equivalents per liter of solution.

The formula for normality is N = (moles of solute) × (equivalents per mole).

So, I need to find the equivalents of KOH in 40 mL, and then calculate how much normality that is per liter.

Wait, 40 mL is 0.04 liters. Let's figure out how many equivalents KOH has.

The molar mass of KOH is important here. K is about 39.1 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So 39.1 + 16 +1 = 56.2 g/mol.

The mass given is 0.56 grams of KOH. The number of moles is mass divided by molar mass. So, 0.56g / 56.2g/mol ≈ 0.00997 mol. Let's approximate that as about 0.01 mol for simplicity.

Each mole of KOH provides one equivalent because it's a 1:1 neutralization. So, equivalents would be 0.01 mol × 1 eq/mol = 0.01 eq.

Now, since the solution volume is 0.04 L, the normality is the equivalents divided by the volume in liters. Wait, no, normality is (equivalents)/(liters of solution). So N = equivalents / V (in L).

So equivalents is 0.01, volume is 0.04 L. So N = 0.01 / 0.04 = 0.25 N.

Wait, but looking at the options, there's option F which is 0.25 N. So does that mean the answer is F?

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake with the calculation. Let's go through it again.

Molar mass of KOH: 56.105 g/mol.

Mass of KOH: 0.56 g.

Moles = 0.56 / 56.105 ≈ 0.00998 mol ≈ 0.01 mol.

Each mole of KOH gives 1 equivalent of OH- (since it's a base). So equivalents are 0.01.

Volume of solution is 40 mL = 0.04 L.

Normality N = equivalents / volume (L) = 0.01 / 0.04 = 0.25 N.

So the normality is 0.25 N, which is option F.

To calculate the normality of a solution, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Normality (N)} = \frac{\text{Equivalents of solute}}{\text{Volume of solution in liters}}
\]

### Given:
- Mass of KOH = 0.56 g
- Molar mass of KOH = 56.105 g/mol
- Volume of solution = 40 mL = 0.04 L

### Step 1: Calculate moles of KOH
\[
\text{Moles of KOH} = \frac{\text{Mass of KOH}}{\text{Molar mass of KOH}} = \frac{0.56}{56.105} \approx 0.00998 \, \text{mol} \approx 0.01 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Determine equivalents of KOH
Since KOH is a strong base, it reacts with an acid in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each mole of KOH provides **1 equivalent**.

\[
\text{Equivalents of KOH} = 0.01 \, \text{mol} \times 1 \, \text{eq/mol} = 0.01 \, \text{eq}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate normality
\[
\text{Normality (N)} = \frac{\text{Equivalents of solute}}{\text{Volume of solution in liters}} = \frac{0.01}{0.04} = 0.25 \, \text{N}
\]

### Conclusion:
The normality of the solution is **0.25 N**, which corresponds to option **F**.
