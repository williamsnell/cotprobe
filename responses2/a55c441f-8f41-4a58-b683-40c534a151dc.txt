Okay, so I've got this complex integral problem to solve. The question is to evaluate the integral of z squared divided by (z minus 5) dz over a circle C where |z| equals 2. The options given are A through J. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, let's start by recalling what I know about complex integrals. I remember that when dealing with integrals of the form ∫(function)/z dz around a closed contour, the residue theorem might come into play. The residue theorem says that the integral is 2πi times the sum of the residues inside the contour.

So, first, I need to identify the function here. The integrand is z²/(z -5). Let's rewrite it as z²/(z -5). The denominator is zero when z is 5, but wait, our contour is |z|=2. That means the point z=5 is outside the contour. So, the function doesn't have any singularities inside the contour C.

Wait, but wait a second. The function is a rational function, so it's analytic everywhere except at z=5. Since our contour is |z|=2, which is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, and z=5 is outside this circle. Therefore, within our contour, there are no singularities.

If there are no singularities inside the contour, then the integral should be zero, according to the residue theorem. Because the sum of the residues inside would be zero, so 2πi times zero is zero.

But wait, wait again. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The function is f(z) = z²/(z -5). The denominator is (z -5), which is a simple pole at z=5. But since our contour doesn't enclose this pole, there are no poles in the region of integration. Thus, the integral is zero.

Looking at the options, option B is 0. So I think the answer is B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could there be any other factors I'm missing? Like, maybe the integrand can be rewritten or simplified in a way that makes the residue theorem more evident. Let me consider that.

Alternatively, maybe using the Laurent series expansion around the point z=0 (since the contour is around the origin) could help. Let's consider f(z) = z²/(z -5). We can factor this as z²/( -5(1 - z/5)) which simplifies to -z²/(5) * 1/(1 - z/5). Then, as a geometric series, 1/(1 - z/5) can be expanded as Σ (z/5)^n for |z| < 5. But in our case, |z|=2, which is less than 5, so this expansion is valid.

So f(z) becomes -z²/(5) * Σ (z^n / 5^n ) from n=0 to infinity. That would be -z²/(5) * Σ z^n /5^n. Multiplying through, it's -Σ z^{n+2}/(5^{n+1}).

So the Laurent series expansion is Σ (-1)/(5^{n+1}) z^{n+2}, which is valid for all n. Now, looking for singularities inside the contour, but we know that the expansion is valid everywhere since |z| is less than 5. So all the terms are analytic inside |z|=2, meaning there are no poles in that region. So the integral is zero.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 0.

The integral in question is ∫_C z² / (z - 5) dz, where C is the circle |z| = 2. To evaluate this, we use the residue theorem. The integrand z²/(z - 5) has a singularity at z = 5, which lies outside the contour |z| = 2. Since there are no singularities inside the contour, the integral evaluates to zero. Thus, the correct answer is B: 0.

Answer: B
