Okay, so I have this limit problem to solve: the limit of the sequence a_n = n divided by the square root of (n² +1). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving sequences, especially as n approaches infinity, I can sometimes simplify the expression by dividing numerator and denominator by a common term. In this case, since both the numerator and the denominator have n terms, maybe that's a good approach.

So, the sequence is a_n = n / sqrt(n² +1). Let me try to divide both numerator and denominator by n. Wait, but the denominator is a square root, so I should probably square it. Oh wait, no, let's see.

Wait, actually, when I divide the numerator by n, I get 1. For the denominator, since it's sqrt(n² +1), dividing numerator and denominator by n would be sqrt( (n² +1)/n² ), which is sqrt(1 +1/n²), right? Because when I factor out n² inside the sqrt: sqrt(n²(1 + 1/n²)) = n*sqrt(1+1/n²). So dividing both numerator and denominator by n gives me 1 divided by n*sqrt(1 + 1/n²).

Wait, no, let me correct that. The original expression is n / sqrt(n^2 +1). So when I divide numerator and denominator by n, I get (n / n) / (sqrt(n²+1)/n) = 1 / (sqrt(1 +1/n²)). Because sqrt(n² +1) is n*sqrt(1 +1/n²), so dividing by n gives sqrt(1 +1/n²).

So that simplifies a_n to 1 / sqrt(1 +1/n²). Now, as n approaches infinity, what happens to 1/n²? Well, 1/n² approaches zero. So the expression inside the square root approaches 1. So the denominator becomes sqrt(1 + 0) = 1. Therefore, a_n approaches 1/1, which is 1.

Wait, but let me double-check my algebra to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another approach is to factor out n from the square root. So sqrt(n² +1) = n*sqrt(1 + 1/n²). Thus, a_n = n/(n*sqrt(1 +1/n²)) = 1/sqrt(1 +1/n²). Yep, that's the same as before. As n approaches infinity, 1/n² tends to zero, so the denominator tends to 1, and a_n tends to 1.

So the limit is 1. Looking back at the options, option G is 1. So the answer should be G.

The sequence is simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by n, resulting in 1/sqrt(1 + 1/n²). As n approaches infinity, 1/n² approaches zero, making the expression inside the square root approach 1. Thus, the limit is 1.

Answer: G: 1
