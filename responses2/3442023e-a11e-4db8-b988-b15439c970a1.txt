Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the principal amount needed to earn a certain interest. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says: How much money must be deposited for 3 months at an annual interest rate of 3% to earn $11.25 in interest. They've given me the formula I = PRT, which stands for Interest equals Principal multiplied by the rate multiplied by time. 

First, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. The interest rate is given as an annual rate, which is 3%, but the time is 3 months. I should convert the time into years because the formula uses years. 

So, 3 months is a quarter of a year. That makes sense because a year has 12 months, so 3 divided by 12 is 0.25. Got that.

Now, the interest I is $11.25. The rate R is 3%, which I need to convert into a decimal. To do that, I divide 3 by 100. So, 3 divided by 100 is 0.03. That's the decimal form of the rate.

Putting it all into the formula: I = P * R * T. I'm solving for P, so I need to rearrange the formula. That would be P = I / (R * T). 

Let me plug in the numbers. I is 11.25, R is 0.03, and T is 0.25. So, R*T is 0.03 * 0.25. Let me calculate that: 0.03 multiplied by 0.25. Hmm, 0.03 * 0.25 is 0.0075. So, R*T is 0.0075.

Now, P = 11.25 / 0.0075. Let me do that division. 11.25 divided by 0.0075. Hmm, maybe it's easier if I think of it as 11.25 * (1/0.0075). Let me calculate 1/0.0075. 

Wait, 0.0075 is the same as 7.5e-3, so 1 divided by 7.5e-3 is approximately 133.333... So, 11.25 multiplied by 133.333... Let me compute that.

11 * 133.333 is 1466.6667, and 0.25 * 133.333 is 33.3333. Adding them together: 1466.6667 + 33.3333 equals 1500. So, P is $1500.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.

I = PRT
11.25 = P * 0.03 * 0.25
11.25 = P * 0.0075
P = 11.25 / 0.0075 = 1500. Yep, that's correct.

Now, looking at the options, option D is $1500. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think if I made any unit conversion errors. 3 months is 3/12 = 1/4 year, which is 0.25. The rate is 3%, so 0.03. So the calculation is correct.

To determine the principal amount (P) needed to earn $11.25 in interest over 3 months at an annual interest rate of 3%, we use the formula I = PRT.

1. Convert the time period to years: 3 months = 0.25 years.
2. Convert the interest rate to decimal: 3% = 0.03.
3. Plug the values into the formula and solve for P:
   P = I / (R * T) = 11.25 / (0.03 * 0.25) = 11.25 / 0.0075 = 1500.

The correct answer is $1500, which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
