Okay, so I've got this question about hikers climbing from Salt Flats to Talon Bluff, and I need to find the difference in elevation. Let's see, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, the question says the hikers started at Salt Flats, which is at an elevation of -55 feet. Then they went up to Talon Bluff, which is at 620 feet. I remember that elevation difference is calculated by subtracting the lower elevation from the higher one. But wait, since one is negative and the other is positive, I should make sure I get the signs right.

So, the Salt Flats are at -55 feet. That's like being below sea level. Talon Bluff is at 620 feet, which is way above sea level. So the question is asking how much higher Talon Bluff is compared to Salt Flats. That means I need to calculate the difference between 620 and -55.

I think the formula is: higher elevation - lower elevation. So here, the higher elevation is 620, and the lower one is -55. So 620 minus (-55) should give me the difference.

Wait, subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive. So 620 plus 55 equals 675. So the difference in elevation is 675 feet.

Looking back at the options, option C is 675 feet. So that's the answer.

The elevation difference is calculated by subtracting the lower elevation (−55 ft) from the higher one (620 ft). Since subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding, the difference is 620 + 55 = 675 feet. The correct answer is C: 675 feet.

Answer: C
