Okay, so I need to figure out who the first U.S. president to resign was. Let me think about this step by step. 

I remember that the question is multiple-choice, and the options are A to J. The options are: Andrew Jackson, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George W. Bush, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy, and Andrew Johnson.

First, I'll start by recalling the roles of these presidents. 

George Washington was the first president, serving from 1789 to 1797. After his death in 1792, the presidency continued. 

Andrew Jackson, I think, was a significant figure. I remember that he served as the 38th president. He was known for being very active in politics, but I'm not sure if he resigned. I think he didn't resign, but perhaps he stepped down. Alternatively, maybe someone else did.

Franklin D. Roosevelt was the 41st president, serving from 1933 to 1945. He was known for his presidency, which included the Great Depression. I don't recall him resigning.

George W. Bush was the 43rd president, from 2001 to 2009. He served a term, but I don't think he resigned. 

I think about the 44th president, which was John F. Kennedy. He was a famous leader, but I believe he didn't resign. He died in 1963, so he didn't resign as president.

Wait, then there's Martin Van Buren. I think he was a former president, the 43rd, but he served until his death. He didn't resign either. 

Then there's Andrew Johnson. I've heard that he resigned. Let me think. I believe Andrew Johnson was the 38th president, and he was a member of the 21st century. He resigned in 1921, I think, after serving as the 29th president. So that would make him the first U.S. president to resign because no one before him (38th) had held that office.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The 38th president was Andrew Jackson, right? So Andrew Johnson was the first president to resign, because he was the 38th, and before him, the 37th was George Washington, who was a successful president. He didn't resign. So the first to resign was Andrew Johnson.

So looking at the options, option I is Andrew Johnson. So the answer should be I.

The first U.S. president to resign was Andrew Johnson. He was the 38th president and resigned in 1921. The correct answer is I: Andrew Johnson.

Answer: I
