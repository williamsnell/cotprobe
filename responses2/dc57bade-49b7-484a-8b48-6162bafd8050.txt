Question:

A 67-year-old man with Parkinson disease is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia. The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?

Options:

A: Begin corticosteroid treatment
B: Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube
C: Administer influenza vaccine
D: Prescribe fludrocortisone
E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa
F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy
G: Initiate physical therapy
H: Obtain CT scan of the chest
I: Obtain a swallowing evaluation
J: Start patient on anticoagulant therapy

Okay, let's try to figure out the right answer to this question. So, the patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who's been admitted for pneumonia treatment. He's experienced increased lethargy over the past day and has diminishing ambulation, especially in the past six months. He's also noting that his tremors are getting worse but he's still taking care of himself at home. His medical history includes hypertension, and he's on several medications like hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He's 168 cm, 78 kg, BMI 28 kg/m². Vital signs: 38.9°C, 60/supine, 68/standing; BP 100/60 supine, 80/50 standing. He's fully oriented but lethargic. The chest shows rhonchi in the right mid lung, no abnormalities, and an infiltrate in the right lower lobe. The ECG is normal. Intravenous antibiotics are started.

The question is about appropriate steps before discharge. They're asking what the most appropriate step is.

Looking at the options, the choices are A to J.

So, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Begin corticosteroid treatment. The patient has elevated blood pressure, which is a known marker for kidney or heart failure. But I'm not sure about the connection here. Also, the patient has a BMI of 28, which is on the higher side, but not necessarily indicating kidney disease. Also, his BP is 100/60, which is considered normotensive. So maybe corticosteroids are not the first step here.

Option B: Place a PEG tube. This would be a guide for when the patient is in a critical condition and the IV line is unsafe. But his chest shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. That might be an indication for a different procedure, like a percutaneous endoscopist might do an endobronchial section. But the question is about steps before discharge. The initial assessment is chest x-ray and ECG, so placing a PEG might be a step that's done during the initial stage of evaluation, perhaps during the assessment. But since the question is about appropriate steps before discharge, maybe B isn't the first thing.

Option C: Administer influenza vaccine. That's a shot, but the patient's primary concern is pneumonia. It's unnecessary and not indicated here.

Option D: Prescribe fludrocortisone. That's an antibiotic, but given the patient's condition (Parkinson's, hypotension, hypertension), fludrocortisone might be used if there's a kidney or heart issue. Wait, but the patient's BP is 100/60, which is not high enough to be indicative of heart failure. So maybe this isn't the right step here.

Option E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa. Levo and carbi are dopants used in Parkinson's treatment. Dismissing them would be incorrect because the patient's condition may have made them respond to other medications. Maybe, but in this case, the patient's primary issue is pneumonia, so maybe these drugs aren't the main ones to be considered for discontinuation. However, it's possible that in the past, these drugs were used for other reasons, but I'm not sure if they're the main ones to be dismissed. Alternatively, if the patient's condition worsened and these drugs are no longer effective, they may need to be dropped. But that's a bit of a stretch.

Option F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy. Parkinson's and hypotension are both associated with the need for oxygen therapy. The patient's BP is 100/60, which is below typical hypoxic thresholds, so oxygen therapy is likely needed. But is this a step that needs to be taken before discharge? Maybe. But the question is about the appropriate step before discharge based on the given situation.

Option G: Obtain a chest CT scan. The patient's chest x-ray is already done and shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. So perhaps that's already done and the next step is something else, but the question is about the most appropriate step before discharge. So, the patient's initial evaluation includes an ECG, chest X-ray, and IV antibiotics. So, perhaps the most appropriate step is to continue IV antibiotics, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the question is asking for the most appropriate step before discharge. So, if the patient's chest shows an infiltrate (which is a sign of lung disease, requiring airways evaluation), and the ECG is normal, but the patient's vital signs are slightly low. Also, his BP is a bit elevated, but not high. So, perhaps he needs to be evaluated for lung disease.

Looking at the options, option B is placing a PEG tube. That would be when the airway is unstable or when the IV line isn't safe. If the patient's airways are unstable, then PEG would be placed. But in this case, the chest x-ray shows an infiltrate, which could be a sign of lung disease, but whether that's critical enough to require an endoscopic evaluation. The other options like IV antibiotics, oxygen, etc., are likely the next steps.

Wait, the question is about appropriate steps before discharge. So before being discharged, the patient needs to have a thorough evaluation. The initial steps are the ECG, chest X-ray, and IV antibiotics. Then, if the airways are unstable, they might need to be evaluated. But the options don't include any of those except maybe option B, which is the PEG, but that's usually done at discharge.

Wait, another thought: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate. That suggests a lung disease. When the airways are stable, but the lung is inflamed, it's considered critical. So, in this case, the patient would need to be evaluated for airway obstruction, possibly through an endobronchial section, which would be a step that's done during the initial assessment. But the options don't include that, so looking back, perhaps the appropriate step before discharge is IV antibiotics, but the options don't have that either.

Wait, looking back, the options include placing a PEG tube as option B. But when is that done? It's usually done when the IV line is unsafe, such as when the patient has an unstable airway or if the current line is causing complications. In this case, the patient's chest shows an infiltrate, which could be a sign of lung disease, but he's fully oriented, so perhaps he's not critically ill. However, the patient's BP is 100/60, which is not high. Maybe the right lower lobe is just a normal finding, but if the patient's other signs point to lung disease, like a rhonchi in the right mid lung, which could indicate a possible lung abscess or infection, but the ECG is normal.

Wait, the initial assessment, before discharge, would include the ECG, chest X-ray, and IV antibiotics. So, the most appropriate step before discharge is the IV antibiotics, but that's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the right lower lobe is a sign of lung disease, which would require proceeding to an endobronchial section, which is a step that's done before discharge. But in the options, there's no such step, so the next best step is to continue IV antibiotics. But that's not listed either. So, perhaps the answer is option E, to stop the medications, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, if the patient's chest shows a right lower lobe, perhaps he's in a more serious airway condition. But without knowing the exact circumstances, it's hard to say.

Wait, the patient's primary issue is pneumonia, but the doctor is also considering other factors. If the drugs are being used for Parkinson's, which is a chronic condition, maybe discontinuing them isn't appropriate. So, option E is not the best step.

Another thought: The patient's vital signs, while elevated in BP, are a bit elevated but not necessarily indicative of heart failure. So, he's probably not in a life-threatening state, but perhaps he's in a critical condition with a serious underlying issue.

Looking back at the options, option G is obtaining a CT scan. But that's already done. So, perhaps the next step is to continue IV antibiotics. But that's not an option. Alternatively, option B: place a PEG tube could be a step that's done, but the patient's chest might be stable enough for the line to be placed safely. But the patient's chest shows a right lower lobe, which is a more serious finding. So, perhaps the appropriate step is to proceed to an endobronchial section, which is not an option here.

Wait, the options don't have any of that, so perhaps the best step is to continue IV antibiotics. But the options don't have that. So, looking again, perhaps the most appropriate step is to continue IV antibiotics. But the options don't have that. So the next best is to proceed with IV antibiotics, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the patient's condition might be getting worse, so perhaps he needs to be placed in a different position.

Wait, the patient's chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung, which could be a possible infection. But the right lower lobe has an infiltrate, which is a lung disease. So, perhaps he needs to be evaluated for that, which would be an endobronchial section. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the best step is to continue IV antibiotics. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is E, to stop the medications.

Alternatively, maybe the patient's condition is getting worse, so stopping the drugs is the right step.

Wait, the question is about appropriate steps before discharge. So, the initial steps are ECG, chest X-ray, IV antibiotics. Then, if the airways are stable, but the lung is inflamed, he may need to be evaluated for lung disease. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the next step is to continue IV antibiotics. But that's not an option. So, looking at the options, maybe option B: Place a PEG tube, but why? It's usually done when the IV line is unsafe. If the patient's airways are stable, maybe it's not the right time to proceed. So, perhaps he needs to be in a more critical state, which would require evaluation.

Wait, in the patient's case, the right lower lobe shows an infiltrate. That could be a sign of lung disease, which is critical. So, perhaps the appropriate step is to order a PEG tube, but that's usually done when the IV line is unsafe. If the patient's airways are stable, perhaps the line can be placed. But if the line is causing complications, it's a different scenario.

In this case, since the patient's BP is 100/60, which is a bit elevated but not high, and his symptoms are limited, perhaps the right lower lobe may not be a major concern. Therefore, the most appropriate step before discharge could be to continue IV antibiotics. However, the options don't include that. So, looking again, perhaps the best step is to continue IV antibiotics, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the patient needs to be placed on a different line or a different treatment plan.

Wait, another angle: the patient's condition includes hypertension. With a BMI of 28, which is slightly high, but not severe enough for heart failure. So, IV antibiotics might be the next step. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa. But why would that be the case? If the patient is responding to other medications like hydrochlorothiazide and fludrocortisone, then these drugs might not be effective anymore for him. So, discontinuing them would be appropriate. But I'm not sure if that's the correct reasoning.

Alternatively, if the patient's condition is worsening, he may need to discontinue the medications. So, option E is correct.

Wait, the question is about appropriate steps before discharge. So, the next step after initial assessment would be to resume IV antibiotics, but that's not an option. Alternatively, discontinuing the medications. Maybe that's the correct action, as the patient's condition is getting worse and these drugs may no longer be effective.

So, the most appropriate step is to stop the medications. So, option E is correct.

The patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease, presenting with respiratory symptoms and elevated BP. The patient's initial evaluation includes an ECG (normal), chest X-ray (right lower lobe infiltrate), and IV antibiotics. The question asks for the most appropriate step before discharge.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Begin corticosteroid treatment**  
  Parkin's disease and hypertension are not indicated for corticosteroids, and the patient's BP is within normal limits. This step is unnecessary.

- **B: Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube**  
  PEGs are typically used when the IV line is unsafe for airway evaluation. However, the patient's chest findings (rhonchi and right lower lobe) suggest a more serious condition, and this step is not indicated.

- **C: Administer influenza vaccine**  
  This is irrelevant as there is no mention of an illness that requires vaccination.

- **D: Prescribe fludrocortisone**  
  While fludrocortisone is used in some contexts, the patient's condition (Pneumonia, hypertension) suggests a need for other treatments, not this medication.

- **E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa**  
  These drugs are used for Parkinson's and may no longer be effective due to worsening respiratory symptoms. Discontinuing them is appropriate as the patient's condition worsens.

- **F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy**  
  Parkinson's and hypotension require oxygen therapy, which should be done before discharge.

- **G: Obtain a CT scan of the chest**  
  The chest X-ray is already done, so this step is unnecessary.

- **H: Obtain a swallowing evaluation**  
  This is not relevant to the patient's condition.

- **I: Obtain a feeding evaluation**  
  Not relevant to the patient's condition.

- **J: Start patient on anticoagulant therapy**  
  Not relevant as the patient's condition does not warrant anticoagulation.

### Conclusion:
The most appropriate step before discharge is to **discontinue levodopa and carbidopa**, as these medications are no longer effective due to the patient's worsening respiratory symptoms and the need for oxygen therapy.
