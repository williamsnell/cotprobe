Alright, so I've got this calculus problem to solve. The function is h(x) = 1/(sqrt(x) + 1), and I need to find the second derivative h''(x) evaluated at x=1. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the first derivative of h(x), which is h'(x). Then, I'll find the second derivative h''(x), and finally plug in x=1 to get the value.

Starting with h(x) = 1/(sqrt(x) + 1). Let me rewrite sqrt(x) as x^(1/2) to make differentiation easier. So, h(x) can be written as 1/(x^(1/2) + 1).

To find the first derivative, I'll use the chain rule. The derivative of 1/u is -u'/u², where u = x^(1/2) + 1.

So, u' is the derivative of x^(1/2) + 1. The derivative of x^(1/2) is (1/2)x^(-1/2) and the derivative of 1 is 0. So, u' = (1/2)x^(-1/2).

Putting that into the derivative formula: h'(x) = - ( (1/2)x^(-1/2) ) / (x^(1/2) + 1)².

Simplify that expression. The x^(-1/2) is 1/sqrt(x), so h'(x) = - (1/(2 sqrt(x))) / (sqrt(x) + 1)². Alternatively, I can write this as -1/(2 sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) + 1)^2).

Wait, I think I might have messed up the denominator. Let me double-check. The derivative of the denominator (x^(1/2)+1) is (1/2)x^(-1/2), so according to the quotient rule, the derivative is - (1/2 x^(-1/2)) / (x^(1/2)+1)^2. Yes, that's correct.

Now, moving on to the second derivative, h''(x). I need to differentiate h'(x). Let's write h'(x) as -1/(2 sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) + 1)^2). Alternatively, I can write it as - [ (sqrt(x) + 1)^2 ) ]^(-1) multiplied by 1/(2 sqrt(x)).

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the product rule or chain rule again. Let's consider h'(x) as a product of two functions: (-1/2) * [1/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) + 1)^2) ].

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to consider h'(x) as a function of u, where u = sqrt(x) + 1, so h'(x) = -1/(2 sqrt(x) u^2). Then, to find h''(x), we'll need to differentiate h'(x) with respect to x.

Alternatively, I can differentiate h'(x) directly.

Let me denote h'(x) as f(x) = -1/(2 sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) + 1)^2). Let's find f'(x).

Using the quotient rule, but perhaps it's easier to use the product rule. Let me write f(x) as (-1/2) * [ (sqrt(x) + 1)^(-2) * x^(-1/2) ].

Wait, perhaps using the product rule is better. Let me let u = sqrt(x) + 1, and v = x^(-1/2). Then, f(x) = (-1/2) * (u)^(-2) * v.

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the chain rule and the product rule together.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the derivative of h'(x). So h'(x) is -1/(2 sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) + 1)^2). Let's denote this as (-1/2) * (sqrt(x) + 1)^(-2) * x^(-1/2).

We can apply the product rule here. The product rule says d/dx [f*g] = f' g + f g'. Let me set f = (sqrt(x) +1)^(-2), and g = x^(-1/2).

So, f' is derivative of (sqrt(x) +1)^(-2). Using the chain rule: (-2)(sqrt(x)+1)^(-3) * (1/(2 sqrt(x))) = (-2) * (1/ (2 sqrt(x)) ) * (sqrt(x)+1)^(-3) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3).

g' is derivative of x^(-1/2), which is (-1/2) x^(-3/2).

So, putting it all together: f' g + f g' = [ (-1)/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) ] * x^(-1/2) + [ (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) ) ] * [ (-1/2) x^(-3/2) ].

Simplify each term:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) * x^(-1/2) = (-1)/(x^(1/2) (x^(1/2)+1)^3) * x^(-1/2) ) = (-1)/(x (x^(1/2)+1)^3).

Wait, because x^(1/2) is sqrt(x), so x^(1/2) * x^(1/2) is x.

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly: sqrt(x) is x^(1/2). So, x^(1/2) * x^(-1/2) is x^0 = 1. So, the first term becomes (-1)/( (sqrt(x) +1)^3 * (x) ) ) ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me re-express. The first term is [ (-1)/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) + 1)^3) ) ] * x^(-1/2). So, sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so sqrt(x) * x^(-1/2) = x^(1/2) * x^(-1/2) = x^0 =1. So, the entire first term becomes (-1)/( (sqrt(x)+1)^3 * 1 ) = -1/( (sqrt(x)+1)^3 ).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) +1)^3) ) * x^(-1/2) = (-1) * x^(-1/2) / (sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) +1)^3) ) = (-1) * 1/(x * (sqrt(x) +1)^3).

Wait, because sqrt(x) is x^(1/2), so sqrt(x) * x^(−1/2) is 1. So that term becomes -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3).

The second term is [ (sqrt(x) +1)^(-2) ) ] * [ (-1/2) x^(-3/2) ) ].

Which is (-1/2) * (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) * x^(-3/2).

So, putting both terms together, f' g + f g' = [ -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) ] + [ (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2) ].

So, h''(x) is the derivative of h'(x), which is (-1/(2 sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) +1)^2 ))’ = f'(x) + g'(x). Wait, no, h''(x) is the derivative of h'(x), so f'(x) + g'(x) is h''(x).

Wait, no, h'(x) is f(x) + g(x), so h''(x) would be f'(x) + g'(x). Wait, no, h'(x) is a single function, so the derivative of h'(x) is f'(x) + g'(x) as per the product rule. So, the calculation above gives h''(x) as [ -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) ] + [ (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2) ].

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in applying the product rule. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the quotient rule directly on h'(x).

Wait, h'(x) is -1/(2 sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) +1)^2). Let me write it as (-1/2) * [ (sqrt(x) +1)^(-2) * x^(-1/2) ].

Using the product rule, the derivative of u*v is u’v + uv’.

Let u = (sqrt(x) +1)^(-2), v = x^(-1/2).

So, u’ = (-2)(sqrt(x)+1)^(-3) * (1/(2 sqrt(x))) ) = (-1) / (sqrt(x) (sqrt(x) +1)^3).

v’ = (-1/2) x^(-3/2).

So, the derivative is u’v + uv’ = [ (-1)/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) ] * x^(-1/2) + [ (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) ] * [ (-1/2) x^(-3/2) ].

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-1)/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) * x^(-1/2) = (-1)/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3).

Second term: (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) * (-1/2) x^(-3/2) = (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2).

So, adding both terms:

h''(x) = [ -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) ] + [ (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2) ].

Now, to combine these terms, perhaps factor out common factors.

Let me factor out -1/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) from both terms.

Wait, let me see:

First term: -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) = -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) = (-1/(sqrt(x) * x^(1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^3)) ) = (-1)/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3 * x^(1/2)) ) = (-1)/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3).

Wait, maybe it's better to express in terms of sqrt(x) and x.

Alternatively, let me factor out -1/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3)) and see what's left.

Wait, the first term is -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) = -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3).

The second term is (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2) = (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out -1/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) from both terms.

Wait, the first term is -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) = -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) = [ -1/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) ] * [ 1/(x^(1/2)) ) ].

Wait, because x^(1/2) is sqrt(x). So, 1/x = 1/(x^(1/2) * x^(1/2)) ) = 1/(sqrt(x) * x^(1/2)).

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, let me factor out -1/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3) from both terms.

Wait, the first term is -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) = - [1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ].

The second term is (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2) = (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) * x^(-3/2).

Let me write x^(-3/2) as x^(-1) * x^(-1/2) ) = (1/x) * (1/sqrt(x)).

So, the second term becomes (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) * (1/x) * (1/sqrt(x)).

Wait, so the second term is (-1/(2 x sqrt(x))) * (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to find a common denominator or factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can combine the terms by finding a common denominator.

The first term is -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3).

The second term is (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2).

Wait, perhaps I can express both terms with denominator x (sqrt(x)+1)^3.

Let me see:

First term: -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) = same as is.

Second term: (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2) = (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2) * [x^2 / x^2] ] = (-1/2) x^(-3/2) x^2 / (x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) = (-1/2) x^(1/2) / (x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) = (-1/2) x^(-1/2) / (sqrt(x)+1)^3.

So, the second term becomes (-1/(2 sqrt(x))) ) / (sqrt(x)+1)^3.

So, now, the two terms are:

First term: -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3).

Second term: [ -1/(2 sqrt(x)) ] / (sqrt(x)+1)^3.

So, h''(x) = [ -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) ] + [ -1/(2 sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3 ) ].

Now, factor out -1/(sqrt(x) (sqrt(x)+1)^3).

So,

h''(x) = - [ 1/(x) + 1/(2 sqrt(x)) ] / (sqrt(x)+1)^3.

Combine the terms in the numerator:

1/x + 1/(2 sqrt(x)).

Let me get a common denominator for these two terms. The common denominator would be 2x^(1/2).

So,

1/x = 2 x^(-1/2) / 2x^(1/2) = 2/(2x^(1/2)).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express both terms with denominator 2x^(1/2).

Wait, 1/x is equal to (2 x^(-1/2)) / (2 x^(1/2)) ) = 2/(2 sqrt(x)) ) = 1/sqrt(x).

Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write both terms with denominator 2x^(1/2) * x^(1/2) ) = 2x.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1/x + 1/(2 sqrt(x)).

Let me write 1/x = 1/(x) = [1/(sqrt(x)) ] * [1/sqrt(x)] ) = [1/sqrt(x)]^2.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to express both terms with denominator sqrt(x).

So,

1/x = 1/(x) = (1/sqrt(x)) * (1/sqrt(x)) ) = [1/sqrt(x)]^2.

But perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me factor 1/sqrt(x) from both terms. So, 1/x = 1/(x) = (1/sqrt(x)) * (1/sqrt(x)) ) = (1/sqrt(x)) * (1/sqrt(x)).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try:

1/x = (1/sqrt(x)) * (1/sqrt(x)) ) * (1/sqrt(x)) ) = (1/sqrt(x)) * 1/(x^1/2).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me just compute 1/x + 1/(2 sqrt(x)) numerically at x=1.

Wait, perhaps since we're evaluating h''(1), we can plug in x=1 directly into h''(x) after simplifying.

Wait, that's a better approach. Let me compute h''(1) by substituting x=1 into the expression we have.

Wait, but let's go back. Alternatively, let me compute each term at x=1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute h''(x) at x=1 directly by substituting x=1 into the simplified expression.

So, h''(x) = [ -1/(x (sqrt(x)+1)^3) ) ] + [ (-1/2) (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) x^(-3/2) ].

At x=1, sqrt(x) is 1.

So, compute each term:

First term: -1/(1 (1+1)^3) = -1/(1 * 8) ) = -1/8.

Second term: (-1/2) (1+1)^(-2) * 1^(-3/2) ) = (-1/2) (1/4) * 1 ) = (-1/2)(1/4) = -1/8.

So, h''(1) = (-1/8) + (-1/8) = (-2/8) = -1/4.

Looking back at the options, option C is -0.25, which is -1/4. So, the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

At x=1:

First term: -1/(1*(sqrt(1)+1)^3) = -1/(1*(2)^3) = -1/(8).

Second term: (-1/2) * (sqrt(1)+1)^(-2) * (sqrt(1))^-3.

Which is (-1/2) * (2)^(-2) * (1)^(-3) = (-1/2) * (1/4) * 1 = (-1/2)(1/4) = -1/8.

So, h''(1) = (-1/8) + (-1/8) ) = (-2/8 ) = -1/4.

Yes, that's correct. So, the answer is option C: -0.25.

Another way to compute is to use the function h(x) = 1/(sqrt(x) + 1), and then compute h''(x) at x=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when combining the terms.

Wait, let me go back.

After computing the two terms, each is -1/8. So, adding them together gives -2/8 = -1/4.

Yes, correct.

So, the final answer is option C: -0.25.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{C}
</think>

To find the second derivative \( h''(x) \) of the function \( h(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + 1} \) and evaluate it at \( x = 1 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **First Derivative \( h'(x) \)**:
   \[
   h(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + 1}
   \]
   Using the chain rule, the derivative is:
   \[
   h'(x) = -\frac{1}{(\sqrt{x} + 1)^2 \cdot \sqrt{x}}
   \]

2. **Second Derivative \( h''(x) \)**:
   Using the product rule on \( h'(x) \), we get:
   \[
   h'(x) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{x} (\sqrt{x} + 1)^2}
   \]
   Let \( u = (\sqrt{x} + 1)^{-2} \) and \( v = \sqrt{x}^{-1} \). Applying the product rule:
   \[
   h''(x) = u'v + uv'
   \]
   - Compute \( u' \):
     \[
     u' = -2 (\sqrt{x} + 1)^{-3} \cdot \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{x} (\sqrt{x} + 1)^3}
     \]
   - Compute \( v' \):
     \[
     v' = -\frac{1}{2} x^{-3/2}
     \]
   - Combine terms:
     \[
     h''(x) = \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{x} (\sqrt{x} + 1)^3} \right) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{x} + 1)^{-2} x^{-3/2} \right)
     \]

3. **Evaluate \( h''(1) \)**:
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the simplified expression:
     \[
     h''(1) = \left( -\frac{1}{1 (\sqrt{1} + 1)^3} \right) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{1} + 1)^{-2} 1^{-3/2} \right)
     \]
     Simplifying each term:
     \[
     h''(1) = -\frac{1}{8} + -\frac{1}{8} = -\frac{2}{8} = -\frac{1}{4}
     \]

Thus, the value of \( h''(1) \) is \(-0.25\), which corresponds to option C.

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
