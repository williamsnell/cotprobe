Okay, so I've got this question about a symmetric random walk on a three-dimensional cubic lattice, Z^3. The question is whether it's transient or persistent, and I need to choose between 0 and 1 based on the options given. Let's think through this step by step.

Hmm, I remember that in random walks, the behavior can be categorized based on the dimensionality of the space. For example, in one and two dimensions, the random walk is recurrent, meaning it will almost surely return to the origin infinitely often. But in three or more dimensions, it's transient. So wait, in 3D, the walk is transient.

Wait, but wait—I should make sure I'm not mixing things up. Let me think again. Recurrent vs transient: recurrent means the walk returns to the origin with probability 1, while transient means it doesn't. In three dimensions, the walk is transient because the probability of returning is less than one.

So the question is whether it's persistent or transient. Oh, wait, wait—the question says "symmetric random walk on Z^3 is transient or persistent?" Oh, persistent implies that the walk has a memory; it tends to continue in the same direction. But I thought that in higher dimensions, the walk is transient, meaning it tends to wander off and doesn't get stuck in a particular direction.

Wait, perhaps I got it backwards. So in 3D, it's transient. So the walk will eventually wander off to infinity, so it's not persistent. So the walk is transient, so the answer would be 0.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.0. So that's the answer.
