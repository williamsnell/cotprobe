Question:

Mr.Caponiis a butcher who recently raised the price of steak at his market from $1.50 to $2.00 a pound. Correspondingly, his sales dropped from 200 pounds per day to 100 pounds per day. Is the demand for steak?

Options:

A: The demand for steak is constant
B: The demand for steak is elastic
C: The demand for steak is indirectly proportional to price
D: The demand for steak is not affected by price
E: The demand for steak is perfectly elastic
F: The demand for steak is perfectly inelastic
G: The demand for steak is inelastic
H: The demand for steak is determined by the quality
I: The demand for steak is dependent on consumer income levels
J: The demand for steak fluctuates seasonally

Okay, so I have this economics question here about steak prices and sales. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says Mr. Capmini raised the price of steak from $1.50 to $2.00 a pound, and as a result, his sales dropped from 200 pounds per day to 100 pounds. I need to figure out whether the demand for steak is elastic or inelastic.

Wait, what do I remember about price elasticity of demand? I think it measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. If demand is elastic, price changes lead to a bigger percentage change in quantity demanded. If it's inelastic, the change is smaller.

So when the price goes up and the quantity sold goes down, it means that buyers are less responsive to price changes. That suggests inelastic demand because when price increases, quantity decreases proportionally or less.

Looking at the numbers: price went up by $0.50, and sales dropped by 50%, from 200 to 100. So the quantity elasticity would be (change in quantity / original quantity) divided by (change in price / original price). 

Change in quantity is -100 pounds, change in price is +$0.50. So (-100 / 200) divided by (0.50 / 1.50). Let's compute that. 

-100/200 is -0.5. Then 0.50/1.50 is approximately 0.333. So (-0.5) divided by (0.333) is about -1.5. The absolute value is 1.5, which is greater than 1. So the elasticity is greater than one, meaning inelastic.

Wait, but wait. Because in the formula, it's the percentage change. So it's ( (100 - 200)/200 ) / ( (2.00 - 1.50)/1.50 ). Let me calculate it again.

The price change is 0.50. So (0.50 / 1.50) is approximately 0.333 (33.333% increase).

Quantity change is -100. So (-100 / 200) is -0.5 (50% decrease).

So dividing those: (-0.5) / 0.333 ≈ -1.5. Absolute value is 1.5, which is greater than 1, so inelastic.

So the demand is inelastic. Looking at the options, option G is "The demand for steak is inelastic." That must be the answer.

The price of steak was increased from $1.50 to $2.00, leading to a 50% decrease in daily sales from 200 to 100 pounds. To determine the elasticity of demand, we calculate the percentage change in quantity demanded (-100%) divided by the percentage change in price (+1.6667, since 0.50/1.50 ≈ 0.3333). This gives a elasticity of approximately 1.5, which is greater than 1, indicating inelastic demand.
