Okay, so I need to figure out the difference between money income and real income. Hmm, I remember that economic terms can be a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down.

Let me think: money income is probably the actual money someone earns before any taxes. Like, if someone earns $50,000 a year, their money income is $50,000. Then real income must be after taxes. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Or is real income adjusted for inflation?

Wait, no, maybe real income is the amount after taxes but adjusted for inflation. Oh, but some sources say real income is the nominal income adjusted for inflation, which would include inflation over the period. So real income is like what someone can buy after considering inflation. So real income accounts for inflation, while money income is before taxes.

Looking at the options:

Option A says money is earned before taxes, real after. That seems correct.

Option B says money is accumulated wealth, real is savings. That doesn't make sense because money income is about what you earn, not how much you accumulate.

Option C says money is purchasing power, real is dollars received. That's a bit different. Purchasing power is about the value of money, but real income is the actual money you can spend. I think real income is based on purchasing power, but wait, maybe not. Or is real income just the nominal amount adjusted for inflation?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Real income is typically the nominal income adjusted for inflation to account for the effects of inflation on purchasing power. So it's the real value of the money earned. So real income is money income adjusted for inflation. So real income would include inflation adjustments.

But the options: Option E says money income is what you receive, real is assets bought with. That doesn't seem right. Real income is about what you can buy, so it's the purchasing power.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed. Let me think again. 

Wait, money income is the money you earn. Real income is the purchasing power, which is the amount you can buy with that money after adjusting for inflation. So, real income is the real value of your money income.

So, for example, if you earn $50,000 a year, your money income is $50,000, and your real income (after inflation) is $45,000 (if inflation is 5%). So the real income is less than money income because of inflation.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: Money income is what you receive, real income is what you can buy. That seems correct. Because money income is the actual money earned, and real income is the purchasing power, which is how much you can buy with that money, considering inflation.

Option A says real income is after taxes. That's correct because real income is the income after taxes. So both A and E might have parts correct.

Wait, no. Option A says money income is before taxes, real income after. So that's correct. Option E says money income is what you receive, real income is what you can buy with your money.

Hmm. So both options A and E are partially correct, but perhaps the wording is different.

Wait, option A is:

A: Money income is the amount of money earned before taxes, while real income is the amount after taxes.

Option E says: Money income is the amount of dollars a person receives, while real income is the amount of goods and services a person can buy with his money income.

So E seems to differentiate between how you receive money and how much you can spend. So E is correct because money income is the cash you earn, and real income is the ability to use that money.

Option A is correct in that real income is after taxes, but option E is also correct in that the two are related but not the same.

Wait, but real income is often considered as the purchasing power, which is the value of the money after adjusting for inflation. So real income is the amount you can buy, which is the same as the purchasing power. So if someone's real income increases, they can buy more goods and services. That's real income.

So option E says real income is the amount of goods and services a person can buy, which aligns with that.

So the correct answer must be E. Let me check the other options.

Option D: Money is goods bought, real is dollars received. No, that's the opposite of what I thought.

Option H: Money is the face value of investments, real is dividends. Not related.

Option J: Money income is nominal wage, real is adjusted for inflation. Wait, that's similar to what I thought. So J says money income is the nominal wageâ€”so you get that, and real income is adjusted for inflation. So real income is after inflation.

Wait, so J is correct in that money income is the nominal amount you get, and real income is the amount after adjusting for inflation.

Wait, but in that case, real income is the purchasing power, which is option E's second part. So then E and J are both correct? Or is that conflicting?

Wait, no. Let me re-read the options.

Option E: Money income is the amount of dollars a person receives, while real income is the amount of goods and services a person can buy.

Option J: Money income is the nominal wage rate, real income is the wage rate adjusted for inflation.

So J's explanation is that real income is after adjusting for inflation. So if J is correct, then real income is after inflation, which is different from A and E.

Wait, but real income is often the value of the money you have, after inflation. So J's statement would say that real income is after inflation. So option E says real income is the amount of goods and services you can buy, which is the same as purchasing power.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again: what's the difference between nominal and real income.

In macroeconomics, real income is the amount of goods and services that a person can buy with their income after adjusting for inflation. So it's the purchasing power. So real income is the value of the money you have considering inflation.

So if you have a nominal wage of $50,000 a year, your real income after adjusting for inflation (say 3%) would be $48,500. So real income is $48,500.

So real income is the purchasing power, which is option E's second part. So E says real income is the amount of goods and services you can buy. That's correct.

Option J says real income is the wage rate adjusted for inflation. So J is correct in that sense, but real income is the value, not the actual wage.

So both E and J could be correct. But looking at the options, the question is asking for the difference between money income and real income.

Wait, the question is phrased as "What is the difference between money income and real income?" So the options are possible answers.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is E because it's the first part correct, and the second part correct in terms of real income being the amount you can buy.

Option E: Money income is the amount of dollars a person receives, while real income is the amount of goods and services a person can buy.

Yes, that fits. So E is correct.
</think>

The difference between money income and real income is that money income refers to the actual money earned before taxes, while real income adjusts this amount for inflation to reflect the purchasing power. 

Option E correctly states that money income is the amount of dollars earned, and real income is the goods and services that can be purchased with that money.
