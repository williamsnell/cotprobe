Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with freezing point depression, but let's try to work through it.

The question says a chemist found a new compound and determined its molecular weight. He used 2.00 grams of the compound in 10 grams of water, and the freezing point depression was -1.22°C. I remember that freezing point depression relates to the concentration of the solute, which is why I think I'll need the formula for that.

Wait, right, the formula for freezing point depression is ΔT = Kf * m, where Kf is the freezing point depression constant and m is the molality of the solution. I think Kf for water is 1.86°C·kg/mol. Oh, right, because that's a standard value.

So, the freezing point depression ΔT is the new freezing point minus the original. The original for water is 0°C, and it went down to -1.22, so ΔT is 1.22°C. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the equation is 1.22 = 1.86 * m. Solving for m, the molality, which is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Wait, the solvent here is water, right? So we have 10 grams of water. Since the solvent's mass is 10 grams, which is 0.01 kg (because 10g = 0.01 kg).

So, m = 1.22 / 1.86. Let me calculate that. 1.22 divided by 1.86. Hmm, 1.86 goes into 1.22 about 0.658 (since 1.86 * 0.658 is approximately 1.22). So m is approximately 0.658 mol/kg.

Wait, but m is molality, which is moles per kg of solvent. So that's moles of solute divided by 0.01 kg. So moles of solute = m * kg of solvent. So that's 0.658 mol/kg * 0.01 kg = 0.00658 moles.

Wait, wait a minute, or is the molality m = (moles)/(kg of solvent), so if m is 0.658, then moles is 0.658 * 0.01 kg? No, wait, the molality is moles per kg. So to find moles, I multiply molality by kg of solvent. So 0.658 *0.01=0.00658 moles of solute.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So the molality is m = (mass of solute in grams) / (molality * mass of solvent in kg). Oh wait, no, molality is moles per kg of solvent. So, yes, if m is 0.658, then moles = 0.658 * kg. Since kg is 0.01, 0.658 * 0.01 = 0.00658 moles. So the compound is 0.00658 moles.

But wait, the mass of the compound is 2 grams. So the molar mass (molecular weight) would be mass divided by moles. So M = 2 g / 0.00658 mol. Let me calculate that.

2 / 0.00658 ≈ 294.6 g/mol. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 450, option H is 350, option I is 150, J is 180. Hmm. 294 isn't exactly any of those. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the molality part.

Wait, the freezing point depression formula is ΔT = Kf * m. I think I used the correct Kf value. Let me recheck. Yes, Kf for water is 1.86 K·kg/mol. So 1.22 = 1.86 * m → m=1.22/1.86.

Oh wait, maybe I should recalculate 1.22 / 1.86 exactly. Let's compute it correctly. 1.22 divided by 1.86. Let me do that division properly.

1.86 goes into 1.22 how many times? 0.6 times, because 0.6 *1.86 is 1.116. 1.22 - 1.116 = 0.104. Bring down a zero (since it's 0.1040). 1.86 goes into 1.040 about 0.056 times (0.056 *1.86=0.103). So 0.6 +0.056 is approximately 0.656. So m ≈ 0.656 mol/kg.

Wait, so m = 0.656 mol/kg. Then the mass of the solute is 2 grams, which is 0.002 kg. Wait, no, wait. No, wait: The mass of the solution is 2 grams plus 10 grams? Wait, wait, no. The compound is 2 grams, and the solvent is 10 grams. So the total mass of the solution is 12 grams, which is 0.012 kg. But wait, the molality is based on the solvent's mass, not the solution's. So for molality, it's moles per kg of solvent. So the solvent's mass is 10 grams, which is 0.01 kg.

So the moles of solute is m * 0.01 kg. So 0.656 mol/kg * 0.01 kg = 0.00656 mol. So the mass is 2 grams, which is 0.002 kg. So the molar mass is 2 grams / 0.00656 mol.

Wait, 2g / 0.00656 mol = approximately 304.6 g/mol. So that's about 305 g/mol. Looking at the options, option C is 305. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the molality calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the freezing point depression is 1.22 degrees. So 1.22 = 1.86 * m → m = 1.22 /1.86.

Calculating 1.22 ÷ 1.86:

1.86 goes into 1.22 how many times?

1.86 × 0.6 is 1.116. 1.22 -1.116 = 0.104.

Bring down a zero: 0.1040.

1.86 × 0.05 = 0.093. 0.1040 -0.093 = 0.0110.

Bring down a zero: 0.01100.

1.86 × 0.005 = 0.0093. 0.01100 -0.0093=0.0017.

So 0.655 times. So m is approximately 0.655.

So m = 0.655 mol/kg.

Then, moles = m * 0.01 kg.

0.655 * 0.01 = 0.00655 mol.

Mass of solute is 2g (0.002 kg). So molar mass is 2g / 0.00655 mol = approximately 305 g/mol.

So the answer is C: 305 g/mol.

To determine the molecular weight of the unknown compound, the following steps were taken:

1. **Freezing Point Depression Formula**: The freezing point depression (ΔT) is related to the molality (m) of the solution by the equation:  
   \[
   \Delta T = K_f \cdot m
   \]  
   where \( K_f \) is the freezing point depression constant for water, \( 1.86 \, \text{K·kg/mol} \), and \( \Delta T = 1.22 \, \text{°C} \). Solving for \( m \):  
   \[
   m = \frac{\Delta T}{K_f} = \frac{1.22}{1.86} \approx 0.656 \, \text{mol/kg}
   \]

2. **Molality Calculation**: The molality \( m \) is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The solvent (water) has a mass of 10 grams (0.01 kg). Using the molality formula:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of solute} = m \cdot \text{mass of solvent in kg} = 0.656 \, \text{mol/kg} \cdot 0.01 \, \text{kg} = 0.00656 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Molecular Weight Calculation**: The compound has a mass of 2.00 g, and the moles of solute are 0.00656 mol. The molar mass (molecular weight) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Molar mass} = \frac{\text{Mass of compound}}{\text{Moles of compound}} = \frac{2.00 \, \text{g}}{0.00656 \, \text{mol}} \approx 304.6 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: The calculated molar mass is approximately \( 305 \, \text{g/mol} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
