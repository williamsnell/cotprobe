Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a deed and the interests of someone's heirs. Let me start by reading the question again to make sure I understand it.

The grantor conveyed an apartment building with a consideration of one dollar. The terms were: to the son for life, then to the uncle for life, but if the uncle moves, it goes to the brother for his uncle's life, and if the uncle doesn't move, it goes to the uncle's heirs. If the uncle moves, it goes to the brother's uncle's heirs. They recorded the deed promptly, so that might affect some clauses. 

The question is about what kind of interest the son has during his lifetime. The options are all different types of remainders or executory interests. I'm a bit rusty on the terminology, so I'll try to recall what each term means.

Let me break down the deed terms. The grant goes to the son for life. Then, if the uncle moves (which probably means the uncle is no longer living), the next interest is to the brother for life of the uncle. If the uncle does move, the next is to the brother's uncle's heirs. If the uncle doesn't move, then the uncle's heirs get it.

So the structure is: son (life) → uncle (life) → brother (life of uncle) → uncle's heirs; or son (life) → uncle (life) → uncle moves → brother's uncle's heirs.

Wait, no, the structure is more like a chain of interests. So when the uncle moves, the next interest is to the brother for his uncle's life, and if the uncle doesn't move, to the brother's heirs.

I think this is a case of a contingent remainder, but let me think again. Contingent remainders are for situations where the interest is given only if a certain condition is met. Like, if the uncle moves, then the son's interest ends and the uncle's next interest is given to the brother.

But wait, what exactly happens when the uncle moves? If the uncle moves, the son's interest ends and the uncle's interest gives to the brother. So the son's interest is a remainder that may end if the uncle moves. But if the uncle does move, then the brother gets the interest. So the son's interest is a contingent remainder because it depends on whether the uncle moves or not.

Alternatively, it's a contingent remainder pur autre vie (which I think is a French term for a remainder for another's life). But wait, isn't a contingent remainder a type of remainder that is contingent upon a condition being met? So in this case, the son's interest is contingent because it's only given if the uncle moves. So if the uncle moves, the son gets nothing. If he doesn't, then he gets the remainder.

Wait, but the structure is that if the uncle moves, then the brother gets the remainder for his uncle's life. So the son's interest is a remainder that becomes a life estate only after the uncle moves. That seems like a contingent remainder because it's contingent on the uncle moving.

Another way to look at it: the son's interest is a life estate that is contingent on the uncle not moving. So it's a contingent remainder. But I'm not sure if the term "pur autre vie" refers to absolute or contingent.

Wait, the options are:

A: contingent remainder pur autre vie.

B: vested remainder absolute.

C: estate pur autre vie.

D: shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

E: vested remainder absolute.

F: contingent remainder in fee simple.

G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

H: vested remainder in fee simple.

I: vested executory interest pur autre vie.

J: contingent remainder absolute.

Wait, I might have misread the options. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is about the son's interest during his lifetime. The options are about the type of remainder or executory interest.

So the structure is the son gets a life estate in fee simple. But if the uncle moves, it changes to the uncle's interest for life (but that's only if the uncle doesn't move). Wait, no, the wording says: "to my son for life, then to my uncle for life, but if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle, then to the heirs of my uncle if my uncle does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my brother if my uncle does move to another state."

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me parse it step by step.

The deed is:

- Son's interest: life.

Then, unless certain conditions happen, the uncle's interest comes into play.

Wait, no. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me see:

The grantor conveyed to the son for life, then to the uncle for life. But if the uncle moves, the next interest is to the brother for the life of the uncle. If the uncle doesn't move, then it's to the uncle's heirs.

Wait, no, the structure is:

Son's interest: life.

Then, if uncle moves, the next interest is to the brother for life of uncle.

If uncle doesn't move, then the next is to the uncle's heirs.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the wording is:

"to my son for life, then to my uncle for life, but if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle, then to the heirs of my uncle if my uncle does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my brother if my uncle does move to another state."

Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as: the son gets life estate, then the uncle gets life estate. But if the uncle moves, then the son's estate ends, and the uncle's estate passes to the brother. If the uncle doesn't move, then the uncle's estate passes to his heirs, and the son's estate passes to his heirs.

Wait, perhaps I should structure it as a chain:

- Son gets life estate.

- Then, the condition is whether the uncle moves or not.

If uncle moves:

- The son's estate ends, and the uncle's estate becomes the brother's life estate for the uncle's life.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is: son (life) → uncle (life) → if uncle moves, brother's life of uncle's life → then, if uncle doesn't move, the uncle's heirs get it, and if uncle moves, the brother's uncle's heirs get it.

So the son's interest is a life estate, but it's conditional on the uncle not moving. Because if the uncle moves, the son's interest is nullified, and the uncle's estate is passed to the brother.

Wait, but in this case, the son's interest is a life estate that is contingent upon the uncle not moving. So it's a contingent remainder pur autre vie. Because it's a remainder (life estate) that may end upon a condition (the uncle moving) and is for the other's life.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about it again. If the uncle moves, the son's interest is terminated. So the son's interest is a life estate that may end if the uncle moves.

So the son's interest is a contingent remainder pur autre vie. Because it's a life estate that depends on a condition (the uncle moving) and is for the other's life.

Alternatively, it's a contingent remainder because it's subject to a condition. So the correct option would be A: contingent remainder pur autre vie.

Wait, but another way: the son's interest is a contingent remainder because it's not automatically given. It will only go to him if the uncle doesn't move. If the uncle moves, the son gets nothing. So yes, it's a contingent remainder.

Wait, but is it a remainder pur autre vie? That term refers to a free remainder for another's life. So if the son's life estate is contingent upon the uncle moving, it's a remainder pur autre vie. But wait, the term "pur autre vie" is a bit confusing. I think "pur autre vie" is French for "for another's life," so perhaps it's a life estate for another's life. So the son's interest is a life estate for another's life, but only if the condition is met.

Wait, another point: the way the deed is written, the son's interest is a life estate, but the next estate (if the uncle doesn't move) is the uncle's heirs. The structure is a bit like a chain of interests.

Alternatively, perhaps the son's interest is a life estate that is contingent on the uncle not moving. So the son's interest is a contingent remainder pur autre vie because it's for another's life (the uncle) and it's contingent on a condition (the uncle moving).

So the correct answer would be option A: contingent remainder pur autre vie.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options include "vested remainder absolute," which would mean the interest is given to the grantor immediately. But in this case, the son's interest is only given if the uncle doesn't move. So it's a contingent remainder.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the son's interest is a remainder for the other's life, but only if a certain condition is met. So it's a contingent remainder pur autre vie.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considered as a contingent executory interest. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A: contingent remainder pur autre vie.

B: vested remainder absolute.

C: estate pur autre vie.

D: shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

E: vested remainder absolute.

F: contingent remainder in fee simple.

G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

H: vested remainder in fee simple.

I: vested executory interest pur autre vie.

J: contingent remainder absolute.

So the options are about the type of remainder or executory interest. So the son's interest is a life estate that is contingent upon the uncle moving. So it's a contingent remainder.

Wait, but wait. The son's interest is a life estate, but it's contingent on the uncle moving. So it's a contingent remainder for the other's life (the uncle moving). So in that case, it's a remainder pur autre vie (for another's life), but it's contingent because it's only given if a condition is met (the uncle moving).

So the correct option is A: contingent remainder pur autre vie.

But wait, looking back, the options. Another thought: The deed's structure is that the son's interest is a life estate, but it's only given if the uncle doesn't move. So the son's interest is a contingent remainder.

Alternatively, perhaps the son's interest is a vested remainder, but that's only if the condition is met. But no, because if the condition is met, his interest is nullified.

Wait, another approach: The son gets a life estate. But if the uncle moves, then the son's estate ends, and the uncle's estate becomes a life estate for the other's life (the uncle's). So the son's interest is only valid if the uncle doesn't move. So it's a contingent remainder.

Wait, so the son's interest is a life estate, but it's contingent on the uncle not moving. So it's a contingent remainder pur autre vie. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes, a remainder may be considered as a vested remainder if it's a life estate that is automatically transferred to the grantor. But in this case, it's conditional. So the correct term would be contingent.

Alternatively, perhaps the remainder is for the other's life but only a life estate, which would make it a contingent remainder.

So I think the correct answer is A: contingent remainder pur autre vie.
</think>

The deed conveys a life estate to the son, with conditions depending on whether the uncle moves. If the uncle moves, the son's interest ends, and the uncle's estate becomes a life estate for the other's life. If the uncle does not move, the son's interest ends, and the uncle's heirs receive it, while the son's heirs also receive the uncle's estate. Since the son's interest depends on the uncle's movement, it is a contingent remainder.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: Contingent remainder pur autre vie.**  
  This describes a remainder (life estate) that is contingent upon a condition (the uncle moving) and is for the other's life. This fits the scenario where the son's interest is contingent on the uncle moving.

- **B: V vested remainder absolute.**  
  This is incorrect because the son's interest is not automatically transferred; it depends on the uncle's movement.

- **C: Estate pur autre vie.**  
  This is incorrect because it refers to a free remainder for another's life, not a contingent remainder.

- **D: Shifting executory interest pur autre vie.**  
  This is incorrect because the interest is not a shifting executory interest.

- **E: V vested remainder absolute.**  
  This is incorrect for the same reason as B.

- **F: Contingent remainder in fee simple.**  
  This is incorrect because the remainder is not in fee simple; it is a life estate.

- **G: Contingent executory interest pur autre vie.**  
  This is incorrect because the interest is a remainder, not an executory interest.

- **H: V vested remainder in fee simple.**  
  This is incorrect because the remainder is not in fee simple.

- **I: V vested executory interest pur autre vie.**  
  This is incorrect because the interest is not a vested executory interest.

- **J: Contingent remainder absolute.**  
  This is incorrect because the son's interest is contingent, not absolute.

The correct answer is **A: Contingent remainder pur autre vie.**
