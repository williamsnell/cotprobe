Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the best buy when purchasing juice. Let me see how I can figure this out. The question is asking which option offers the best value for money, meaning the lowest price per bottle or per unit.

First, I need to calculate the cost per bottle for each option. The best buy will have the lowest cost per bottle. Alternatively, if all options have the same price per bottle, then it's a tie, but I'll check each option to make sure.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 7 bottles for $15.75. To find the cost per bottle, I divide $15.75 by 7. Let me do that calculation. 15.75 ÷ 7 is 2.25. So that's $2.25 per bottle.

Option B: 5 bottles for $11.25. Dividing 11.25 by 5 gives me 2.25 again. Hmm, same as option A.

Option C: 9 bottles for $20.25. Dividing 20.25 by 9. Let me calculate that. 9 goes into 20 two times (18), remainder 2. Then bring down the 2, making 22. 9 goes into 22 two times (18), remainder 4. Bring down the 5, making 45. 9 goes into 45 five times. So total is 2.25. Another $2.25 per bottle.

Option D: 4 bottles for $9.00. 9 divided by 4 is 2.25. So same as the others.

Option E: 11 bottles for $24.86. Let me calculate 24.86 ÷11. 11 goes into 24 twice (22), remainder 2.66. Bring down the 8 to make 26. 11 goes into 26 twice (22), remainder 4.6. Bring down the 6 to make 46. 11 goes into 46 four times (44), remainder 2. So it's approximately 2.26 per bottle. Wait, that's a bit higher than the others.

Option F: 12 bottles for $27.00. 27 ÷12 is 2.25. Same as before.

Option G: 16 bottles for $35.68. Let's calculate 35.68 ÷16. 16 x 2 is 32, remainder 3.68. 16 x 0.2 is 3.2, so 2.25? Wait, 16 x 2.25 is 36, but the total is 35.68. Hmm, maybe I should do it more accurately. 35.68 ÷16: 16 into 35 is 2, 2x16=32. Remainder 3.68. 16 into 36 (3.68 is 3.68) is 0.23. So total is 2.235. So about $2.24 per bottle. Wait, that's actually a bit lower than others. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me redo option G. 16 bottles for $35.68. 35.68 ÷16: 16 × 2 =32, so 2, remainder 3.68. 16 × 0.2 = 3.2, so 3.68 is 3.2 + 0.48. So 0.2 + (0.48/16). 0.48 ÷16 is 0.03. So total is 2.23. So per bottle is about $2.23, which is lower than options A, B, C, D, F, H, I, J.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check all options again because I might have made a mistake in G.

Wait, let me compute G again properly. 16 bottles cost $35.68. So 16 × 2 =32, so 2.00, remainder 3.68. 3.68 divided by 16 is 0.23. So 2.23 per bottle. That's less than the others, which are 2.25 each.

Hmm, that's interesting. So G's price is $2.23 per bottle, which is cheaper than others. So that's a better deal.

Let me check the other options again.

Option H: 18 bottles for $40.50. 40.50 ÷18. 18×2=36, remainder 4.50. 18×0.25=4.5, so 2.25 again. Same as before.

Option I: 14 bottles for $31.50. 31.50 ÷14. Let's compute 31.50 ÷14. 14×2=28, remainder 3.50. 14×0.25=3.5, so 2.25 again. Same as others.

Option J: 3 bottles for $6.72. 6.72 ÷3 is 2.24. So $2.24 per bottle.

So now, let me recap:

A: $2.25
B: $2.25
C: $2.25
D: $2.25
E: ~$2.26
F: $2.25
G: $2.23 (lowest so far)
H: $2.25
I: $2.25
J: $2.24

So G is the best buy at $2.23 per bottle, which is cheaper than the others. So the correct answer should be G.

The best buy is option G, as it offers the lowest price per bottle at approximately $2.23.
