Question:

Discuss the role of attitudes and expectancy in attention.

Options:

A: Attitudes and expectancy are only relevant in the initial stages of attention.
B: Attitudes and expectancy only affect long-term memory.
C: Attitudes and expectancy alter the intensity of stimuli required to capture attention.
D: Attitudes and expectancy only affect attention during high-stress situations.
E: Attitudes and expectancy affect attention by increasing the speed of cognitive processing for all types of information.
F: Attitudes and expectancy only influence our perception of size and duration.
G: Attitudes and expectancy change the sensory modalities we pay attention to.
H: Attitudes and expectancy guide the focus of attention by making relevant information salient and excluding other information.
I: Attitudes and expectancy primarily determine the accuracy of our visual attention.
J: Attitudes and expectancy have no effect on attention.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the role of attitudes and expectations in attention. Let me try to break it down.

The question is asking which statement correctly describes how attitudes and expectations affect attention. The options are A through J. I'll need to think about what I've learned about attention, especially regarding these factors.

First, I remember that attention is a dynamic process that happens at various stages. It starts with the first thing the person hears, then builds up as they focus on more detailed information. So, early stages involve basic processing, and later stages involve more complex tasks.

Attitudesâ€”these are the beliefs someone has about a situation. They can influence how they perceive things, process information, and decide what's important. For example, if someone has a positive attitude towards a task, they might focus more on the task's details rather than getting overwhelmed.

Expectancy refers to the belief about the outcome. If someone expects an outcome, they might be more likely to engage in activities that lead to that outcome. Like, if someone expects success, they might be more motivated to seek help or prepare better.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Only in the initial stages. Hmm, I don't think so. I think attitudes and expectations play a role in all stages, not just the beginning.

Option B: Only affect long-term memory. Wait, that's not right. Attitudes and expectations are more about processing information and attention, not just long-term memory storage.

Option C: Alter the intensity of stimuli. I'm not sure. I think they affect how much attention is given to a task, but perhaps not the intensity of the stimuli themselves. Maybe the intensity of the stimuli relates to how much someone can focus on them, which might be influenced by their expectations and attitudes.

Option D: Only affect high-stress situations. I don't recall that. Attitudes and expectations are probably more about general attention processes rather than specific situations.

Option E: Affects by increasing cognitive processing speed. No, I don't think that's correct. I think they influence the quality of attention, not necessarily the speed of processing.

Option F: Only influence perception of size and duration. Hmm, not sure. I think size and duration are more about physical perception, but maybe the way information is processed (through attention) does involve how we perceive it.

Option G: Change sensory modalities. I don't think that's the main role of attitudes and expectations. They're more about the content and context, not the sensory aspects.

Option H: Guide focus by making relevant info salient. Oh, wait! I remember something about the salience of information. When someone has a positive attitude, they might focus on what's most important. So, in that case, their focus is guided by their attitudes and expectations, making the relevant info stand out. That would fit option H.

Option I: Only determine visual attention accuracy. No, that doesn't sound right. Visual attention is influenced by more than just accuracy; it's also about how we perceive what's there.

Option J: No effect. That can't be right because I think they do have an impact.

Wait, let me check option H again. The question is, do attitudes and expectations guide focus by making information salient? Yes, I remember reading something about this in psychology. It's about how attention is directed to the most relevant or important information, which is influenced by the person's attitude and expectations about the situation.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be option H.

The correct answer is **H: Attitudes and expectations guide the focus of attention by making relevant information salient and excluding other information.**

**Answer: H**
