Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me see what it's about. A train is rounding a curve with a certain radius, and I need to find its acceleration. Hmm, right, circular motion. Oh wait, acceleration in circular motion is centripetal acceleration, right? I remember the formula for that.

The formula, if I'm not mistaken, is a = v² / r. But wait, wait, the units. The speed is given in miles per hour (mi/hr), and the radius is in feet. Oh, right, I need to convert everything to consistent units before I apply the formula.

So, converting miles per hour to feet per second. One mile is 5280 feet, and one hour is 3600 seconds. So, 60 mi/hr is how many ft/s? Let me calculate that. 60 * 5280 ft / 3600 s. Let's see, 60 divided by 3600 is 1/60, wait no, 60 divided by 3600 is 1/60. But 5280 *60 is 316,800. Wait, perhaps another way: 60 mi/hr is equal to (60 * 5280) feet per hour. So that's 316800 feet per hour. To get feet per second, divide by 3600 seconds. So 316800 / 3600.

Let me compute that: 316800 divided by 3600. Let's see, 316800 ÷ 3600. Well, 3600 goes into 316800 how many times? Let's calculate 3600 * 88 = 316800. So, 88 ft/s. Oh wait, that's the speed in ft/s. So v is 88 ft/s.

Now, the radius is 484 ft. So now, a = v² / r. So, (88)^2 / 484.

Let me compute 88 squared. 80² is 6400, 8² is 64, and cross terms 2*80*8=1280. So  (80+8)^2=80² + 2*80*8 +8^2=6400 + 1280 +64= 7744. Wait, 88 squared is 7744.

So 7744 divided by 484. Let me compute that. 484 *16= 7744. Because 484 *10=4840, 484*6=2904. 4840+2904=7744. So 7744 /484=16. So the acceleration is 16 ft/s².

Looking at the options, option H is 16 ft/sec². So the answer should be H.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for centripetal acceleration in circular motion: 

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
\]

**Step 1: Convert units.**  
The speed is given as 60 mi/hr, and the radius is 484 ft. Convert 60 mi/hr to ft/s:  
\[
60 \, \text{mi/hr} = \frac{60 \times 5280}{3600} = 88 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate acceleration.**  
Using the converted speed and radius:  
\[
a = \frac{88^2}{484} = \frac{7744}{484} = 16 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

**Step 3: Match the result to the options.**  
The calculated acceleration is 16 ft/s², which corresponds to option H.

**ANSWER: H: 16 ft/sec²**
