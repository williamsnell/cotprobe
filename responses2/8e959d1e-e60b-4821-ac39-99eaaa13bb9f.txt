Okay, so I need to find the largest factor of 54,321 that's less than 54,321. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the largest proper factor of a number is just the number divided by its smallest prime factor. So, first I should probably try to find the prime factors of 54,321.

Wait, but 54,321 is a pretty big number. Maybe there's a smarter way than just factoring it all the way. Let me see if I can find any patterns or divisibility rules that might help.

First, I'll check if 54,321 is divisible by small primes. Let's try 3. The sum of its digits should be a multiple of 3. 5+4+3+2+1 = 15, which is divisible by 3. So, 54,321 รท 3 = ? Let me calculate that. 3 goes into 5 once, remainder 2. Bring down 4: 24. 3 into 24 is 8. Multiply 8*3=24, subtract 24, remainder 0. Bring down 3: 03. 3 into 3 is 1. Multiply 1*3=3, remainder 0. Bring down 2: 02. 3 into 2 is 0, with remainder 2. Bring down 1: 21. 3 into 21 is 7. So the division gives 18,107. So 54,321 รท 3 = 18,107.

Wait, but the question asks for the largest factor less than 54,321. So, 18,107 is a factor. But wait, is 18,107 the largest possible one? Or is there a larger factor?

Wait, no. Because 18,107 is a factor, and 54,321 divided by 18,107 is 3, which is a factor. So the factors are 1, 3, 18,107, and 54,321. So the largest factor less than 54,321 is 18,107. But wait, that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are A:54,320, B:121, C:18,107, D:1000, E:27,000, F:7, G:50,000, H:300, I:5,432, J:6.

So option C is 18,107, which is exactly the factor I found. So the correct answer would be C. But wait, wait. Did I make a mistake? Because the options don't have 18,107 as the largest. Let me think again.

Wait, no, 18,107 is the only factor between 1 and 54,321 except for 1 and itself. So the largest is 18,107. So the answer is C. But wait, let me check if there are any other factors. Are there any other primes that divide 54,321?

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if 54,321 is a square number. Let me calculate the square root of 54,321. Let's see, 233 squared is 54289, because 230^2=52900, 233^2=52900 + 2*230*3 + 3^2 = 52900 + 1380 +9 = 54289. 234^2 is 54756, which is higher than 54321. So the square root is between 233 and 234, so it's not a perfect square. So no, it's not a square number. So the factors are in pairs, and the largest proper factor is 54,321 divided by the smallest prime factor, which is 3, giving 18,107. So the answer should be C.

The largest factor of 54,321 less than 54,321 is 18,107, which is obtained by dividing 54,321 by its smallest prime factor, 3. 

Answer: C: 18,107
