Question:

In which of the following situations would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?

Options:

A: A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.
B: After consuming a large amount of alcohol at a party, a defendant decided to set a neighbor's car on fire out of spite. He was seen by witnesses and later arrested and charged with arson.
C: A defendant had been drinking at a local pub and got into a heated argument with another patron. The argument escalated, and the defendant pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed the other patron. The defendant is arrested and charged with attempted murder.
D: A defendant had consumed a fifth of bourbon. Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.
E: A defendant spent the evening drinking at a bar. On his way home, he broke into a house, intending to steal valuables. However, he fell asleep on the couch before he could steal anything. He was discovered by the homeowners and arrested and charged with attempted robbery.
F: At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.
G: A defendant was drinking at a bar when he noticed a woman leave her purse unattended. He stole the purse and was later arrested and charged with theft.
H: A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.
I: A defendant had been drinking heavily at a friend's house. Later that evening, he decided to drive home despite being significantly over the legal blood alcohol limit. On the way, he ran a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. The defendant is arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter.
J: After a night of heavy drinking, a defendant broke into a jewelry store and stole several expensive items. He was caught on the store's surveillance cameras and later arrested and charged with burglary.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about criminal culpability and intoxication. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question asks which situation would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability. The options are A through J, each describing a different scenario involving intoxication and criminal charges.

First, I need to understand the key concept here. Intoxication usually refers to consuming alcohol, which can impair judgment, making it harder to make rational decisions. But in some cases, even when intoxicated, a person can still be found guilty because the intoxication doesn't negate the criminal charge.

So, the main idea is whether intoxication can negate the guilt. The classic example is the "intoxication exception," which allows a person to be found not guilty if they were intoxicated. But there are exceptions, like if the intoxication was so severe that it's no longer manageable and they can't form a coherent mental state.

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The defendant was drinking all the time in a bar. He tried to draw a gun under arrest. The charge is conspiracy to commit robbery. I remember that even if intoxicated, if there's enough intent and the criminal intent was present, the crime can be held. So, intoxication might not negate the charge.

Wait, but wait. The defendant was already intoxicated when the event happened. Does that affect the guilt? I think that the intoxication can negate if the intoxication was so severe that the person couldn't form a coherent mental state, but in this case, he was trying to draw a gun. So, perhaps if the intoxication was such that the decision to act was impaired, but the intent was there. Hmm.

Option B: The defendant set a neighbor's car on fire. He was seen and later arrested. The charge is arson. I know that even if intoxicated, if the intent was there, it's still a crime. So, intoxication probably doesn't negate.

Option C: The defendant stabbed another patron with a knife. The charge is attempted murder. Intoxication would make him unable to form a coherent mental state if he was too drunk. But wait, was he attempting to kill someone? If he was too drunk, was his intent to kill possible? Or perhaps he was drunk but still had intent. Wait, no. If he was so intoxicated he couldn't think clearly about intent, then maybe he couldn't form that intent. Or maybe the intent was to kill, but he couldn't form it because of intoxication. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe in some jurisdictions, being intoxicated but still intent to kill is considered a crime.

Option D: He stabbed a victim with a knife and the victim was awake. Charge is assault intent to commit rape. Intoxication would impair his ability to form the intent to commit rape. So, he can't negate the charge because his intent was to commit rape. So this might be an option where intoxication negates guilt.

Wait, but is the intent to commit rape considered a crime? Yes, it is. So if he's intoxicated, he can't form that intent, so the prosecution can't deny it.

Option E: He broke into a house intending to steal. The crime is attempted robbery. Again, if he was too intoxicated to form the intent, then he can't negate the charge. So this might not be an option where intoxication negates guilt.

Option F: He committed sexual intercourse after drinking. The charge is statutory rape. But wait, the age is 17 for females. He was drinking two six-packs, which is a lot. But the age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17, so he was 18 when he had his eye on her. So if he was over 17 at the time, he could have been 17 or older when he agreed, but he was 18. So perhaps he was legally over 17, but the age is 17 for females, so if he was under, he couldn't have had consent. But the question is about whether intoxication negates the charge. Since he was intoxicated, maybe he couldn't form the intent to commit rape. So in this case, intoxication might negate the charge.

Option G: He stole the purse and used it. The charge is theft. If he was intoxicated, he'd be unable to form the intent to steal, so the crime is still there. So this would be an option where intoxication doesn't negate.

Option H: He took a tire iron from his car and hit a victim. The charge is assault intent to commit battery. Intoxication would impair his ability to form the intent to commit battery, so this would be a situation where intoxication can't negate the charge.

Option I: He drove home with a red light, hit a pedestrian, and was charged with vehicular manslaughter. Intoxication would make him unable to form the intent to cause harm, so this would be another case where intoxication negates.

Option J: He broke into a jewelry store and stole items. The charge is burglary. Intoxication would impair his ability to form intent to commit burglary, so this would be an option where intoxication can't negate.

Now, the question is which of these does not allow the defendant's intoxication to negate his culpability. So, I'm looking for a case where even though he was intoxicated, he can still be found not guilty.

Wait, but let me think again. The intoxication exception is that if the intoxication was such that the defendant couldn't form a coherent mental state, then he can't negate. Otherwise, if he had enough intent, the crime is still there.

So looking for a situation where he was intoxicated but couldn't form the intent.

Looking back at the options:

Which option is about a crime that can be held even if the defendant was intoxicated?

Looking at option D: assault intent to commit rape. If he was too intoxicated to form that intent, the prosecution can't deny it. So, intoxication does negate.

Option F: He committed sexual intercourse after drinking. If he was too intoxicated to form consent, then he can't negate the charge. So intoxication negates.

Option G: He stole the purse. Intoxication negates.

Option H: He took a tire iron and hit someone. Intoxication negates.

Option I: He committed a violent crime. Intoxication negates.

Option J: He committed burglary. Intoxication negates.

So, are there any options where intoxication would not negate? Let me check the options again.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine each option.

Option A: He was drunk in a bar and was trying to draw a gun. If he was so intoxicated that he couldn't form the intent to draw a gun, then he can't negate the crime. Or maybe he was so drunk that he couldn't even form the intent to kill someone else. But the charge was conspiracy to commit robbery. So if he couldn't form the intent to kill, but he had a plan, maybe the intent was present, so the crime can still be held.

So in this case, intoxication might not negate.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of each option again.

The question is which situation would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his culpability. So, which option would be a crime that can be held even when intoxicated.

Looking for an option where the intoxication would allow the prosecution to deny the charge.

Wait, but I think that the intoxication exception allows the prosecution to deny the charge only if the intoxication was so severe that the defendant couldn't form a coherent mental state. If the intoxication was mild enough, some intent could still be present.

So, in which of these cases would intoxication be so severe that it can't form intent.

Looking for a scenario where the defendant's intoxication makes it impossible for him to form the intent to commit the crime.

Option B: He committed arson. If he was too drunk, could he form the intent to commit arson? I think that the intent to commit a specific type of crime, like arson, requires intent. So even if intoxicated, he could still form the intent. So intoxication wouldn't negate.

Wait, but maybe he was too drunk to form the intent. I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of the general rule.

The intoxication exception is that if the intoxication was such that the defendant couldn't form a coherent mental state that would be necessary to form the intent, then the prosecution can't deny the charge.

So, for example, if the defendant was so intoxicated that he couldn't form the intent to kill someone, then the prosecution can't deny the charge.

Looking at option D: He committed assault intent to commit rape.

If he was too intoxicated to form the intent to commit rape, then the prosecution can't deny.

But in option F, he committed sexual intercourse. If he was too intoxicated to form consent, then prosecution can't deny.

Option G: He stole the purse. Intoxication negates.

Option H: He committed battery. Intoxication negates.

Option I: He committed a violent crime. Intoxication negates.

Option J: He committed burglary. Intoxication negates.

So, the only options left that could be about a crime that can't be defeated by intoxication are A, B, and perhaps others.

Wait, maybe I'm missing an option. Let me re-examine option A. The defendant was in a bar, drank, and was attempting to draw a gun. Did he have the intent? If he was too drunk to form the intent to draw a gun, then intoxication would negate. But if he had enough intent, the crime can be held.

So, if the intoxication was such that the decision to act was impaired, but the intent was there, then intoxication can't negate.

But I'm not sure if the intent to draw a gun is enough. Because perhaps the intent is present, so even if intoxicated, he can still be convicted.

So, in that case, intoxication would not negate the charge.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of each option again.

The question is, which option would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his culpability.

So, which option's crime can't be proved based on intoxication?

Looking for a situation where the defendant was intoxicated, but the crime can still be held.

Option B: He committed arson. If he was too drunk to form intent to commit that crime, perhaps the prosecution can't deny. But I'm not sure if being intoxicated would make him unable to form the intent. I think in some jurisdictions, a reasonable person under the influence might still have the intent.

Option D: He committed assault with intent to commit rape. If he was too drunk, perhaps he couldn't form that intent. So, intoxication would negate.

Wait, but in option F, he committed sexual intercourse after drinking. The age of consent is 17, so if he was 18, he couldn't have had the consent. But if he was under 17, he couldn't have consented. But if he was over 17, he could. But the question is about the age of consent, which is 17. So, if he was 18, he couldn't have gotten the consent. So, if he was intoxicated, could he form the intent to commit that?

Wait, but the key is whether the intoxication makes him unable to form the necessary intent. So, if the potential to form the intent is impaired, then intoxication can negate.

So, in that case, if he was so intoxicated that he couldn't form the intent, then intoxication can't negate.

Looking for which option would make the defendant unable to form the necessary intent.

Looking at option F: He committed sexual intercourse. If he was too drunk to form the consent, then intoxication can't negate. So, he can't negate the charge.

Wait, but wait. If he was intoxicated, he might have a mental state that makes him unable to form the intent. So, perhaps he couldn't form the intent to commit the crime, making intoxication a defense.

Alternatively, maybe the intoxication would not affect his ability to form the intent because he was under the influence but still had the intent.

I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should think of each option's charge and see which one can't be proved.

Option A: Conspiracy to commit robbery. If he was too drunk to form the intent to kill someone, then he can't negate.

Option B: Arson. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't negate.

Option C: Attempted murder. If he couldn't form the intent to kill, then he can't negate.

Option D: Assault intent to commit rape. If he couldn't form that intent, then he can't negate.

Option E: Perpetrator intent to steal. If he couldn't form that, can't negate.

Option F: Sexual intercourse. If he couldn't form consent, can't negate.

Option G: Theft. If he couldn't form intent to steal, can't negate.

Option H: Battery intent to commit assault. If he couldn't form that, can't negate.

Option I: Viable manslaughter. If he couldn't form the intent, can't negate.

Option J: Burglary. If he couldn't form intent, can't negate.

So, the only option where intoxication would not be able to negate is one where the crime can be held regardless of intoxication.

Wait, perhaps looking for an option where the intoxication would make him unable to form the necessary intent.

Looking again, perhaps the correct answer is J. Because he was drinking and broke into a jewelry store. The crime is burglary, but he was too intoxicated to form the intent to commit that. So, in option J, he could be found not guilty.

But wait, the question is which situation would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option again.

The only option where the defendant's intoxication would not negate the charge is when the intoxication makes it impossible to form the necessary intent.

So, looking for an option where the defendant's intoxication would make him unable to form the intent.

Looking at option D: He committed assault intent to commit rape. If he was too drunk to form that intent, then intoxication can't negate.

Wait, but I think that if he was intoxicated, he might still have the intent. So, perhaps intoxication can't negate.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Another approach: The intoxication exception allows the prosecution to deny the crime only if the intoxication was so severe that the defendant couldn't form a coherent mental state. If the intoxication wasn't severe enough, the prosecution can't deny.

So, for example, if the defendant was too drunk to form the intent to kill someone, then intoxication can't negate. But if he was still capable, the prosecution can.

Now, looking for an option where the intoxication makes it impossible to form the intent.

Looking at option F: He committed sexual intercourse after drinking. If he was too drunk to form consent, then intoxication can't negate.

But wait, the age of consent is 17, so if he was 18, he couldn't have consented. But the question is about the defendant's intoxication, not about the age.

Wait, perhaps the age of consent is 17, so if he was 18, he couldn't have gotten the consent. But if he was under 17, he could have. But the question is about whether intoxication would negate, not the actual age.

Wait, but the key is whether the intoxication makes him unable to form the necessary intent.

So, if the potential to form the intent is impaired, then intoxication can negate.

So, looking for an option where the intoxication makes it impossible to form the intent.

Looking at option H: He took a tire iron from his car and hit a pedestrian. The charge is assault intent to commit battery. If he was too drunk to form that intent, then intoxication can't negate.

But I'm not sure if the intent is the issue or if the intoxication makes the person unable to form the intent.

Another angle: The intoxication exception applies when the intoxication was so severe that the defendant couldn't form a coherent mental state. If the intoxication was mild, the prosecution can't deny the intent.

So, in the case of option F, if the intoxication was such that he couldn't form the intent to commit sexual intercourse, then intoxication can't negate. But wait, the age of consent is 17, so if he was 18, he couldn't have consented. But if he was under 17, he could have gotten the consent. But the question is about intoxication, not the actual age.

Wait, but the question is about the defendant's own intoxication, not the actual age. So, perhaps intoxication doesn't affect the ability to form the intent, because the intent is what's needed regardless.

So, maybe all the options except one are capable of the prosecution denying the charge based on intoxication.

Wait, the only case where the intoxication is so severe that the intent is impossible would be where the person is too drunk to form the intent to commit a particular crime.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of each option again.

Option A: Drawing a gun. If he was too drunk, could he form the intent? I think yes, because he had the intent, but perhaps the intoxication makes him unable to form the intent. Or maybe he could still form the intent because he was over 17 but the intent is not dependent on age.

Option B: Arson. If he was too drunk, could he form the intent? Probably yes, but perhaps the intent is still present.

Option C: Attempted murder. If he was too drunk, could he form the intent? Probably yes, but perhaps the murder intent is being held.

Option D: Assault intent to commit rape. If he was too drunk, could he form the intent? Maybe yes, but perhaps he couldn't because the intent to commit rape is present, but the intoxication makes him unable to form that intent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options.

The question asks which situation would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate.

So, the options that are crimes that can be held even when intoxicated are the ones where intoxication doesn't negate.

The ones where intoxication can't negate are the crimes that can't be proved without the intoxication.

From what I recall, the intoxication exception is that if the intoxication was so severe that the person couldn't form a coherent mental state, then the prosecution can't deny the crime.

So, the options that don't trigger the intoxication exception (i.e., where the person can still form the intent) would be the ones where intoxication can't negate.

So, looking for the option where the intoxication could negate.

Wait, but the question is which situation would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate. So, the correct answer is the one where the defendant's intoxication can't negate, i.e., the option where the person can be found not guilty even after intoxication.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option.

Option A: He was drinking and trying to draw a gun. The charge is conspiracy to commit robbery. So, if he was too drunk to form the intent to draw a gun, the prosecution can't find him guilty. But if he had the intent, maybe the prosecution can.

Wait, but I think that the intent is present, so the prosecution can find him guilty.

So, in this case, intoxication can't negate.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of the general rule.

The general rule is that if the intoxication was so severe that the person couldn't form a coherent mental state, then the prosecution can't find him guilty.

So, for instance, if someone was so drunk that they couldn't form the intent to kill someone, then they can't be found not guilty. But if they had the intent, they can be found not guilty.

So, in this case, the defendant was intoxicated in a bar and was trying to draw a gun. If he had the intent, then he can be found not guilty, but if he couldn't form the intent, then he can't.

But I'm not sure if the intent exists in the first place. So, if he was intoxicated but had the intent, then he can be found not guilty.

If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty.

So, in this case, intoxication may or may not negate.

But the question is which situation would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate.

So, perhaps the correct answer is the one where intoxication can't negate, which would be when the person couldn't form the intent regardless of intoxication.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The question is which situation would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate.

So, which option would the defense not have a valid argument against.

Looking for the option where the intoxication would allow the defense to deny.

So, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, looking for an option where the intoxication would allow the defense to deny.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of each option again.

The options are:

A: Conspiracy to commit robbery. Intoxication may or may not negate.

B: Arson. Intoxication may or may not negate.

C: Attempted murder. Intoxication may or may not negate.

D: Assault intent to commit rape. Intoxication may or may not negate.

E: Viable manslaughter. Intoxication may or may not negate.

F: Sexual intercourse after drinking. Intoxication may or may not negate.

H: Battery intent to commit assault. Intoxication may or may not negate.

I: Stealing from a car after a red light. Intoxication may or may not negate.

J: Burglary. Intoxication may or may not negate.

So, the only option that doesn't have an issue with intoxication is perhaps when the defendant couldn't form the intent.

Wait, but all options have possible issue with intoxication.

So, perhaps the correct answer is where the intoxication could negate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each option and decide whether the intoxication can negate.

So:

A: The defendant was intoxicated and trying to draw a gun. If he had the intent, he can't be found not guilty. If he couldn't form the intent, he can't be found not guilty.

So, if he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. But the question is whether intoxication can negate.

So, in this case, intoxication may or may not negate.

B: The defendant was intoxicated and committed arson. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. But the question is whether intoxication can negate.

So, perhaps intoxication can negate.

C: The defendant was intoxicated and attempted murder. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. So, intoxication can negate.

D: The defendant was intoxicated and committed assault intent to commit rape. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. So, intoxication can negate.

E: The defendant was intoxicated and tried to save a person. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. So, intoxication can negate.

F: The defendant was intoxicated and committed sexual intercourse. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. So, intoxication can negate.

G: The defendant was intoxicated and theft. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. So, intoxication can negate.

H: The defendant was intoxicated and battery intent to commit assault. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. So, intoxication can negate.

I: The defendant was intoxicated and tried to steal someone. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. So, intoxication can negate.

J: The defendant was intoxicated and committed burglary. If he couldn't form the intent, then he can't be found not guilty. So, intoxication can negate.

Wait, so in all the options, intoxication can negate because the defendant could form the intent.

But that can't be the case because the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an option.

So, I think the answer is J.
</think>

The correct answer is **J**. 

**Explanation:**
The defendant was intoxicated and broke into a jewelry store, committing burglary. Under the intoxication exception, if the defendant could not form the necessary intent to commit burglary, the prosecution could deny the charge. However, since the defendant was intoxicated and had the intent to commit the crime, the intoxication exception does not negate the charge. 

Thus, the defendant's intoxication would **not** be able to negate the charge of burglary in this scenario.
