Question:

Co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.
B: Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he physically placed the bomb in the casino.
C: Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.
D: The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.
E: Both are guilty, but only the one who made the phone call is guilty of a felony.
F: Both are not guilty, because they intended to defuse the bomb before it exploded.
G: Both are guilty, but only the one who built the bomb is guilty of a felony.
H: Neither is guilty, because the faulty wire, an unforeseeable circumstance, caused the bomb to explode.
I: Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.
J: The co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty, because he made the demand for the money.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically involving a co-defendant who built and transported a bomb. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, so the scenario is that two co-defendants were fired from a casino after four years, and they want to plant a bomb to get $1 million. They agreed to make sure the casino had adequate warnings. But one of them built the bomb himself, drove to the casino, and placed it in a hallway closet. The other co-defendant called the casino to demand the money. The casino didn't pay anything, and the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. Then, an investigation found the wire was faulty, making the bomb detonate prematurely.

The question is, if they're charged with violating a state statute that says detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in a building is a felony, which of the statements (A to J) is correct.

Hmm. The key here is understanding the elements of a felony charge. Let me recall what I know. A felony requires a serious criminal intent and the use of a dangerous situation. So, even if someone just tried to detonate a bomb, if the circumstances were dangerous enough, it might count as a felony.

Looking at the evidence: They built and transported the bomb. So, they intended to place the bomb in a dangerous environment? Wait, no, they put it in a hallway closet, which is a relatively safe place. But then, the other co-defendant called the casino, expecting money. Without the bomb, the second co-defendant didn't need to do anything. But the bomb didn't detonate until 24 hours, which was a significant delay.

Wait, the question says the wire was faulty, making the bomb explode prematurely. So the explosion was due to the wire being bad, not necessarily the environment they placed it in. So the explosion happened in a building, which is dangerous. But wait, the first co-defendant built it themselves and put it in the closet, so the explosion didn't happen there. Hmm.

Wait, the setup is a bit confusing. Let me read again.

They were fired, so the casino had to hire someone to replace. They fired the manager, so the company is now without someone to replace. So the manager is being replaced by the new manager, but the original four years' employees (including the two co-defendants) were fired.

The co-defendants decided to plant a bomb. They agreed to have the casino be given adequate warnings, so maybe that indicates they thought it was a serious matter. But the problem is, they placed the bomb in a hallway closet, which is a very safe place. Then, the other co-defendant called to demand the money, but the casino didn't pay, and the bomb exploded.

Wait, but the bomb detonated in a dangerous environment because the wire was faulty. So the explosion happened in the building, which is dangerous. So the explosion is in a building, which is dangerous, and they tried to detonate it. So that would fit the felony charge.

Now, the question is whether the co-defendants were guilty. Let's consider their actions. The first co-defendant built the bomb and drove to the casino, which is a dangerous place. So he intended to place the bomb there, but the explosion happened 24 hours later. So, if the bomb was placed in a dangerous location, even if it didn't explode there, the explosion could be in a dangerous environment.

Wait, but in this case, the explosion was in a safe place (the closet), but the wire was bad. So the explosion happened in the building, which is dangerous. So the initial placement in the closet may not have been the issue. The problem is that the explosion happened in a dangerous environment.

But wait, the second co-defendant called the casino to demand the money, but the casino didn't pay. The first co-defendant built the bomb, drove to the casino, and placed it in the closet. The explosion happened in a building, so the explosion was in a dangerous place.

So, the first co-defendant was responsible for placing the bomb in a dangerous location (the closet is a safe place, but that's where the explosion didn't happen). Wait, no, the explosion happened in the building, not in the closet. So the first co-defendant built it, drove to the casino, which is a building, and placed it in a hallway. So the explosion happened in the building, which is dangerous. So that's a serious situation.

So the first co-defendant built the bomb and put it in a dangerous location. So that's an element of a felony. But wait, he was also driving to the casino, which is a dangerous place, so that's another reason.

Wait, but in the case of felony, the primary element is a serious crime with dangerous circumstances. So if the first co-defendant intended to place the bomb in a dangerous location and even drove there, then that's a serious situation.

But the second co-defendant called the casino to demand money, which is a minor action. He didn't do anything else. The other co-defendant made a phone call, but the casino didn't pay. So the key is whether the first co-defendant's actions were a serious crime.

Wait, but in this scenario, the first co-defendant built the bomb, put it in the closet, and then drove there. So the explosion happened in the building, which is a dangerous situation. The first co-defendant's actions included placing the bomb in a dangerous place, so that's a serious crime.

But wait, the other co-defendant was driving to the casino (a dangerous place) and placed the bomb in a safe place (the closet). So the first co-defendant's placement was in a safe location, but the explosion happened in a dangerous environment.

But wait, the first co-defendant built the bomb, placed it in a safe location (the closet), but then drove there. So the explosion happened in the building, which is dangerous. So the first co-defendant's actions included placing the bomb in a dangerous environment, which is a serious crime.

So, the first co-defendant's actions were both placing the bomb in a dangerous location and driving to a dangerous place. So he committed a felony.

But wait, the options are a bit tricky. Let me check the options again.

Option D says: The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.

Wait, the phone call was made by the other co-defendant (the one who didn't build the bomb) to demand the money. The casino didn't pay, but the bomb exploded, killing 30 people.

The first co-defendant built the bomb and drove to the casino. So if he had the intent to detonate the bomb, even though it didn't happen there, that might be a felony. But another angle is that the explosion happened in a dangerous location, which is the building, and the first co-defendant was driving to a dangerous place. So that's a serious situation.

Wait, but the first co-defendant built the bomb and placed it in a safe spot, but drove there. So the explosion was in the dangerous environment. So the first co-defendant's actions involved placing the bomb in a dangerous location, which is a serious crime.

But what about the other co-defendant, who made the call? His actions were just calling to demand money, which wasn't a substantial step in the crime. The co-defendants had intended to plant the bomb, which led to the explosion. So the first co-defendant was the one who intended to cause the crime by building and placing the bomb in a dangerous place. The second's actions weren't part of the felony charge, so he is not guilty.

Wait, but the explosion was in a dangerous place. So the first co-defendant was responsible for the explosion. So the first co-defendant is guilty. The second's actions were a minor step, so not guilty.

Wait, but option D says the first is guilty because he built and transported the bomb, and the other is not guilty because his call wasn't substantial.

Wait, but the explosion was caused by the placement of the bomb in a dangerous location. So the first co-defendant's actions were a serious crime.

But another angle: the first co-defendant built the bomb and placed it in a safe location, but drove there, which is dangerous. So that's a serious crime.

So, the first is guilty, the second is not. So option D would be correct.

Now, looking at other options.

Option A: Both guilty. But the second's action was not substantial. So not A.

Option B: Only the one who built the bomb is guilty. That's true, but the other's actions weren't substantial, so B is correct. But the question is if the first is guilty, which he is.

Option C: Neither guilty. Incorrect, because the first is guilty.

Option E: Neither guilty, but the first is guilty. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Both not guilty. Incorrect.

Option G: Both guilty, but only the first guilty. That's incorrect because the second's actions were not substantial.

Option H: Neither guilty, because the wire was bad. That's incorrect because the explosion happened in a dangerous environment.

Option I: Neither guilty because the casino's negligence caused the explosion. No, because the first co-defendant placed it in a safe place, but the explosion was in the building. So the first was responsible.

Option J: The co-defendant who called is guilty, but that's only correct if he was part of the plan. But the plan included building the bomb, which led to the explosion. So J's reasoning would not hold because the explosion was due to the placement, not the call.

So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the co-defendants are guilty of violating a state statute that criminalizes detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building. The key issue is whether the first co-defendant's actions were sufficient to meet the elements of a felony charge.

### Analysis of the Scenario:
1. **First Co-Defendant's Actions**:
   - Built the bomb himself.
   - Driven to the casino, a dangerous location.
   - Placed the bomb in a hallway closet, a safe location.
   - The explosion occurred in the building, where the first co-defendant had placed the bomb in a dangerous environment.

2. **Second Co-Defendant's Actions**:
   - Called the casino to demand the money.
   - The casino did not pay, leading to the explosion.
   - The wire in the bomb was faulty, causing the explosion prematurely.

### Key Elements of a Felony Charge:
A felony requires serious criminal intent combined with dangerous circumstances. The first co-defendant was responsible for placing the bomb in a dangerous environment (the building) and driving to it. Additionally, the explosion occurred in a dangerous setting, which is a serious situation. The first co-defendant's actions directly contributed to the detonation, even though the explosion was not in the closet.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A: Both guilty** → Incorrect. The second co-defendant's actions were not substantial in advancing the crime.
- **B: Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty** → Correct. The first co-defendant is guilty because he placed the bomb in a dangerous location and drove there, leading to the explosion.
- **C: Neither guilty** → Incorrect. The first co-defendant committed a felony.
- **D: The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, but the other is not guilty** → Correct. The first co-defendant is guilty because placing the bomb in a dangerous environment constitutes a serious offense. The second's actions, while minor, were not substantial in advancing the crime.
- **E: Both are guilty, but only the one who made the phone call is guilty of a felony** → Incorrect. The first co-defendant's actions, including placing the bomb in a dangerous location and driving there, are sufficient to meet the felony requirements.
- **F: Both not guilty** → Incorrect. The first co-defendant was guilty.
- **G: Both guilty, but only the one who built the bomb is guilty of a felony** → Incorrect. The second co-defendant's actions were not substantial.
- **H: Neither guilty** → Incorrect. The first co-defendant was guilty.
- **I: Neither guilty** → Incorrect. The first co-defendant committed a felony.
- **J: The co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty** → Incorrect. The first co-defendant's actions, not the second's, were responsible for the explosion.

### Conclusion:
The first co-defendant is guilty of committing a felony, while the second's actions were not substantial in advancing the crime. Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.
