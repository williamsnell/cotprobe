Question:

A football player sued a football team for breach of contract. He was a star player for the team before suffering a serious hip injury. Although the player attempted to continue playing for the team, he failed a physical examination and was cut from the team roster. After failing his physical, the team discontinued making contract payments to the player as per the terms of his employment contract. In his lawsuit, the player claimed that he was physically fit to continue playing but that he was cut from the team because they wanted to stop making contract payments. At trial, the team called its physician, an orthopedist, to testify that the player's hip injury was, in fact, career-threatening and, in his opinion, sufficiently serious to warrant failing his physical. The team physician stated during his testimony that his diagnosis was based, in part, upon an examination of the player's x-rays and review of an MRI test conducted by another doctor. Neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results have been admitted into evidence. In all likelihood, the team physician's testimony should be

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the team physician is not a radiologist capable of interpreting MRI results.
B: admissible, if the football player confirms that the physician's diagnosis was shared with him.
C: admissible, provided that the other doctor testifies as to the validity of the MRI test results.
D: admissible, provided that the team physician has been practicing for more than 10 years.
E: inadmissible, because the team physician's opinion was not based in part upon his own firsthand observation of the player's physical condition.
F: inadmissible, because neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results had been admitted into evidence at the time he formulated his opinion.
G: admissible, only if the x-rays and MRI test results are presented during the trial.
H: admissible, provided the team physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field.
I: inadmissible, as the team physician has a possible bias towards the football team.
J: inadmissible, because the team physician should have conducted the MRI test himself.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about contract law and admissibility of testimony. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand.

The player sued a football team for contract breach. He was a star player before getting a serious hip injury. He tried to play but failed a physical exam and was cut from the team. The team later discontinued contract payments because of his injury. In his lawsuit, he claimed his hip injury was career-threatening, and the team's physician testified that his diagnosis was based on x-rays and MRI results, which weren't admitted.

The question is about whether the team's physician's testimony is admissible. The options are A to J, each suggesting different reasons for inadmissibility.

Hmm, what's the rule about the admissibility of a doctor's opinion? I remember that in contract law, when a contract is for services rendered (like contract work), the court will look at the evidence presented and the witness's testimony. But if a contract is for services that are not directly observable, like a physical examination or a diagnosis, then the testimony might not be admissible unless it's supported by evidence.

Wait, but in this case, the contract was for the player's services. So the contract is services rendered, which makes the contract enforceable. But the issue is about the credibility of the team's physician's opinion. The player is trying to prove that the physical was necessary because he was cut from the team. The team's physician is saying the hip injury is career-threatening, and based on x-rays and MRI, the diagnosis. But the x-rays and MRI weren't included in the evidence.

I think the issue is whether the physician's opinion is admissible as a witness testimony. So, the rule is that a witness's opinion is not admissible unless the facts were supported by evidence. The contract here is services rendered, so the contract is enforceable. But the contract could be for services rendered, so the contract might not be enforceable because the contract is for the services rendered.

Wait, no. If the contract is for the services rendered, then it's enforceable. But the issue is about whether the physician's opinion is a fact to be believed. So, in contract law, the contract might not be enforceable if the contract is for services that are not directly observable. Or wait, no. The contract is for the services rendered by the team, so the contract is enforceable. But if the contract is for services rendered, then the player can bring a contract dispute because the contract is enforceable.

Wait, no. The contract is for the services rendered by the team, so the contract is enforceable. So the contract is enforceable, but the issue is about the credibility of the physician's opinion as a fact.

But wait, the contract is for the services rendered, so it's enforceable. But the contract might be for services rendered, which makes the contract enforceable. But the issue is about whether the physician's opinion is admissible.

Now, the point is whether the team's physician's opinion is admissible as a witness's testimony. So, in this case, the team's physician's opinion is based on the x-rays and MRI results, which aren't admitted. So they need to be admitted elsewhere. Alternatively, the opinion's credibility depends on the evidence that supported it.

But in this case, the contract is for services rendered. So, the contract is enforceable, but the issue is the credibility of the physician's opinion. So, the team's physician's opinion is their opinion based on x-rays and MRI. Since the contract is enforceable, the witness's opinion might not be admissible because it's not a fact that can be verified by evidence. But wait, sometimes the opinion is admissible if the facts are supported by evidence.

Wait, but in some cases, a witness's opinion is admissible if the facts were supported by evidence. So, if the contract is for services, then the facts are known to the witness. But if the contract is not for services, then the facts might not be known to the witness. Because the contract is not for services, the facts about how the player was injured might not be known to the team's physician. So, in this scenario, the contract is for the services rendered (player's time on the team), so the facts about the injury are known to the team's physician. Therefore, the physician's opinion is based on facts that are known to them, so it's admissible.

Wait, but the contract is for the services rendered, so the facts about the injury are known to the witness. So the physician's opinion is based on facts that are known to the witness, so it's admissible. So the team's physician's opinion is admissible because the facts are known to the witness.

Looking at the options, option B says it's admissible if the player confirms. That's a possible scenario, but the question is about what should be the case in general. So the correct reasoning is that the facts are known to the witness, so the opinion is admissible.

Another point: the contract is enforceable because it's for services rendered. So, the contract is enforceable. But the issue is about the credibility of the physician's opinion. So the opinion is admissible because it's based on the facts known to the witness, because the contract is for services rendered.

Wait, but the contract is enforceable, but the question is about the credibility of the opinion. So, in contract law, when a contract is enforceable, the credibility of the witness's opinion may affect the outcome. But the fact that the contract is for services rendered means that the facts about the injury are known to the witness, making the opinion admissible.

So, looking at the options, option B is suggesting that the opinion is admissible if the player confirms. But the question is about the general case. So, the correct answer would be that the opinion is admissible because the facts are known, but the issue is about whether it's admissible in general.

Wait, but the contract is for services rendered, so the facts are known. So, the physician's opinion is admissible because it's based on facts that are known to the witness. So, the correct reasoning is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known.

But the options: option B says the opinion is admissible if the player confirms. That's a condition but not necessarily the reason. The reason is that the facts were known.

Alternatively, another reason: The contract is enforceable, so the facts of the injury are known, making the opinion admissible.

Wait, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the contract is enforceable, so the facts are known, making the opinion admissible. So, the opinion is admissible because the facts are known.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is either B or G or others. Option B says the opinion is admissible if the player confirms. But that's a condition, not necessarily the reason. The reason is that the facts are known to the witness.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. The contract is for services rendered, so the facts are known. Therefore, the opinion is admissible because it's based on facts that are known to the witness.

Looking at the options, option B says if the player confirms, it's admissible. But the facts are known regardless of the player's confirmation. So, the correct reasoning is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known, making the opinion credible.

Wait, but the contract is for services rendered, so the facts are known. Therefore, the opinion is admissible because it's based on those known facts.

Looking back, option B says it's admissible if the player confirms. That's a condition, but the question is about what should be the case. The correct reasoning is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known, making it admissible.

So, which option is correct? Let me look again.

Option G says the opinion is admissible only if the x-rays and MRI were presented. But that's about the evidence, not the credibility of the opinion.

Option B is about the player's confirmation. That seems more about the issue of the credibility of the opinion.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The issue is whether the opinion is admissible. The contract is enforceable, so the facts are known. Therefore, the opinion is admissible as it's based on facts known to the witness.

So the correct answer is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known. Looking at the options, none directly state that, but option B is about the condition. So, the opinion is admissible if the facts were known, which is the player confirming, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option B: admissible, if the player confirms that the physician's diagnosis was shared with him.

Option G: admissible, provided the other doctor testifies as to the validity of the MRI test results.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the rule regarding the credibility of the opinion. The rule for a witness's opinion is that it's admissible if it's based on evidence that bears probable cause for belief. So, if the facts were known to the witness, the opinion is admissible.

But in this case, the contract is for services rendered, so the facts are known. So, the opinion is admissible.

But the contract is for services rendered, so the facts are known, making the opinion admissible. So the correct answer is option B if the facts were known, but the player's confirmation is a condition, not the reason.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known, making the opinion credible.

So, looking again at the options, the correct answer is that the opinion is admissible if the facts were known, which is the player confirming. But the player's confirmation is a condition, not the reason. The correct answer is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known, making the opinion credible. So, option B is the correct reasoning because it states that the opinion is admissible if the player confirms. But the player's confirmation is a condition, not the reason.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to think differently. The contract is for services rendered, meaning the facts are known. Therefore, the physician's opinion is based on facts known to the witness, making it admissible.

So, the correct answer is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known. Which would correspond to option B, but option B is a condition.

Wait, none of the options directly state that the facts were known. The options B and G are about conditions. So perhaps the correct answer is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B because the opinion is admissible if the player confirms, implying that the facts were known.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the admissibility of a witness's opinion. The opinion is admissible if the facts were known to the witness, regardless of whether the witness confirmed it. So, the facts were known to the witness, so the opinion is admissible.

But the contract is for services rendered, so the facts are known. Therefore, the opinion is admissible because the facts were known. So option B seems to suggest that the opinion is admissible if the player confirms, which is a condition. But perhaps the correct reasoning is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known, making the opinion admissible regardless of the player's confirmation.

Alternatively, another approach: the contract is for services rendered. Thus, the facts are known, so the opinion is admissible. So, the correct answer is B, because if the facts were known, the opinion is admissible.

Wait, but the player didn't confirm the facts. The player is the witness. So, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the facts were known because the contract is for services rendered, so the opinion is admissible regardless of the player's statement.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the key points. The contract is for services rendered, which makes the contract enforceable. The physician's opinion is based on x-rays and MRI. Neither of these were admitted, so the opinion needs to be admissible elsewhere.

So, the opinion is based on facts known to the witness, making it admissible. Therefore, the correct answer is B: admissible if player confirms (but that's a condition). Or, perhaps the correct answer is G: provided the other doctor testifies as to validity, but that's about the evidence, not credibility.

Wait, another angle: the contract is for services rendered, which makes the facts known. Therefore, the opinion is admissible because the facts were known.

Looking at the options, option B says if the player confirms, then it's admissible. But the player's confirmation is a condition, not the reason. So, if the facts were known, the opinion is admissible. So, the correct answer is the option that states the opinion is admissible because the facts were known.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known, making it admissible regardless of the player's statement. So, the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option B is admissible if the player confirms. That's a condition. So, the facts were known, making the opinion admissible. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B because the opinion is admissible if the facts were known, which is the player confirming.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known. So, in that case, the answer would be option B because it states that the opinion is admissible if the player confirms.

Wait, but the player's confirmation is a condition, not the reason. The reason is that the facts were known. So, the correct answer is that the opinion is admissible because the facts were known, making it admissible. So, the correct option would be B, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B because the player confirms, which makes the opinion admissible.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is likely B, because the contract being for services rendered makes the facts known, so the opinion is admissible.

The correct answer is **B: admissible, if the player confirms that the physician's diagnosis was shared with him.**

**Explanation:**
The player sued a football team for breach of contract, claiming his injury was career-threatening, necessitating his discontinuation from the team. The team's physician testified that his diagnosis was based on x-rays and MRI results, which were not admitted. The contract was for services rendered, meaning the facts of his injury were known to the witness. Therefore, the physician's opinion is based on facts that are known to the witness, making it admissible. 

Option B states that the opinion is admissible if the player confirms the diagnosis was shared, which is a condition, but the primary reason is that the facts were known. Thus, the correct reasoning aligns with option B.
