The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the author's assertion regarding a quantum jump helping Western Europe achieve global hegemony between the 15th and 18th centuries. The author, Alfred Crosby, mentions that one of the key points is exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of continents outside the lands of the society. He specifically hints at Western Europe doing something like that.

The options are A through J. Let me read through each and think about what's relevant.

Option A: The discovery and colonization of Australia. I know Australia was a major continent for European colonization. The Australian colonization was significant for European history, especially in the context of the Age of Discovery. They were involved in various projects that might have been part of the "quantum jump" the author is talking about.

Option B: Cultural exchange with Native American tribes. This relates to the Age of Exploration, which includes European colonization and the spread of knowledge. Cultural exchange can enrich societies but doesn't directly explain a massive jump in productivity. It's more about integration rather than a sudden leap.

Option C: Centralized government in Europe. Centralization in governance might have helped with efficient resource management, but the question is about a quantum jump. Centralization could contribute, but is it the best support for the assertion?

Option D: The reformation of Catholic Christianity. While this might have influenced European society, the author's statement is more about ecological and resource exploitation, not much about religious change. So probably not the best support.

Option E: Conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Aztec were in South America. Conquest might have allowed for the transfer of resources and knowledge, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to the ecological and resource aspects the author is talking about.

Option F: Industrial revolution in Britain. The industrial revolution was a major shift, but it's in Britain, not Western Europe. While it had some impacts, the focus here is on Western Europe, so perhaps F isn't the best option.

Option G: Isolationism of Tokugawa Japan. That was a period in Japan, but it relates more to the 17th and 18th centuries. Maybe, but not directly Western Europe.

Option H: Colonization of the interior of Africa. Africa's interior is the Middle East, which had a lot of resources that European colonization could exploit. But the author's example was Australia, which I think is more directly tied to European colonization.

Option I: The construction of the Great Wall of China. That's more of a cultural and environmental project, but again, not directly about exploiting resources outside Europe.

Option J: The establishment of trade routes with China. China's trade routes could provide resources and markets, but again, not directly about a quantum jump in productivity.

So, the main point is about exploiting continents outside the lands of the society. Which option supports that?

Option A: Australia is a continent. Their colonization involved extensive exploration and colonization, which could have brought resources and knowledge. It's a significant step and could have contributed to a global shift in productivity.

Option H is about Africa, but that's more about the geography, not the resource aspect. Similarly, the Great Wall of China (option I) is more about trade routes and not about resource exploitation.

So, between A and H, but H is about China, which is within the lands of Western Europe. So, A is a continent outside their lands, which fits the author's point. Plus, the discovery and colonization of Australia would have exposed their resources and perhaps facilitated a shift in resource management and trade, leading to a quantum jump.

The best option to support the author's assertion is **A: The discovery and colonization of Australia**. This choice highlights a continent outside Western Europe's lands, directly supporting the idea of exploiting resources and ecosystems to achieve a quantum jump in productivity, as the author suggests.
