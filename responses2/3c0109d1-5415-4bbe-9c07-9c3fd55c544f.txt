Okay, so I've got this question about converting a liter-atm work into joules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my unit conversions, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

Wait, what's a liter-atm? Oh right, it's a unit of work done in the gas industry. I remember that 1 liter is equal to 0.001 cubic meters, and 1 atmosphere is about 101.325 pascals. Oh right, because 1 atm is the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at sea level. So maybe I can use the formula for work done, which is force times distance. But how do I translate that into energy?

Oh wait, right! The conversion from pressure-volume work (which is energy) is done using the formula W = PΔV. But wait, the units here are liters and atmospheres. So I need to convert everything into SI units, like joules. Because 1 joule is 1 N·m. Right, and 1 N is kg·m/s², so 1 J is kg·m²/s².

Let me think about the units. So 1 atm is 101325 Pascals (since 1 atm = 101325 N/m²). And 1 liter is 0.001 m³. So I can calculate the work done in terms of P·m³, which equals J.

Wait, so the formula for work when pressure is constant is W = PΔV. Here, P is in Pascals, ΔV is volume change in m³. So for 1 liter, ΔV is 0.001 m³. So substituting in, W = 101325 Pa * 0.001 m³.

Let me compute that. 101325 times 0.001 is 101.325 joules. Oh, so 1 liter·atm equals approximately 101.325 J. So if the question is asking how many joules are equivalent to one liter-atm, the answer would be about 101.3 joules.

Looking at the options: Option E is 101.3 joules. So the correct answer should be E.

To convert a liter·atm to joules, we use the formula \( W = P \Delta V \), where \( P \) is the pressure in Pascals and \( \Delta V \) is the volume change in cubic meters. 

1. **Convert units**:  
   - \( 1 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{m}^3 \)  
   - \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \)

2. **Calculate work**:  
   \[
   W = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \times 0.001 \, \text{m}^3 = 101.325 \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Match with options**:  
   The closest option to \( 101.325 \, \text{J} \) is **E: 101.3 joules**.

Answer: E
