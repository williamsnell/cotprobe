Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the surface area of a right rectangular prism. The formula given is S = 2(lw + wh + hl). The question gives me the length, width, and height, and I need to compute the surface area. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me note the given values: length (l) is 12 inches, width (w) is 9 inches, and height (h) is 2 inches. I need to plug these into the formula correctly.

Let me write down the formula again: S = 2(lw + wh + hl). So I need to calculate each of the products first.

Starting with lw: that's length multiplied by width. So 12 inches times 9 inches. Let me calculate that. 12 times 9 is 108. So lw = 108.

Next is wh: width times height. That's 9 inches multiplied by 2 inches. 9 times 2 is 18. So wh = 18.

Then comes hl: height times length. That's 2 inches times 12 inches. 2 multiplied by 12 is 24. So hl = 24.

Now I have to add these three products together: 108 + 18 + 24. Let me do that. 108 plus 18 is 126, and 126 plus 24 is 150. So the sum of the three terms (lw + wh + hl) is 150.

Finally, I need to multiply this sum by 2 to get the surface area. So 2 times 150 equals 300. Therefore, the surface area S is 300 square inches.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Sometimes I make mistakes in multiplication or addition.

12 * 9 is indeed 108. 9 * 2 is 18, correct. 2 * 12 is 24, right. Adding them: 108 +18 is 126, then 126 +24 is 150. Multiply by 2: 300. Yep, that's correct.

The surface area is calculated by plugging the given dimensions into the formula. Surface area S = 2(lw + wh + hl). Substituting l=12, w=9, h=2:

- lw = 12 * 9 = 108
- wh = 9 * 2 = 18
- hl = 2 * 12 = 24

Sum: 108 + 18 + 24 = 150; Surface area = 2 * 150 = 300.

Answer: A: 300
