Okay, so I've got this question about normal heart rates for adults at rest. Hmm, I remember from my basic physiology classes that the resting heart rate varies a bit between different ages. Let me think. I think for adults, the average resting heart rate is around 60 to 100 beats per minute. But wait, that's the average, so what's the normal range?

Oh right, there's a guideline called Young's rule, which estimates the target heart rate zone. But wait, I'm not sure if that's directly related here. The question is about the normal resting rate, so perhaps it's about the average.

I think the resting heart rate for adults is between 60 and 110. But wait, some sources say it's typically between 60-80, while others might go up to 100. Oh wait, maybe the average is around 60-80, but some sources say up to 100. But when it comes to normal ranges, I believe the average is 60-80. So looking at the options, let me check.

The options are:

A: 60-110
B: 70-90
C: 50-80
D: 60-80
E: 60-90
F: 80-100
G: 40-60
H: 70-110
I: 50-70
J: 60-100

So the correct one would be D: 60-80. Because that's the typical average for a resting heart rate. Let me think againâ€”maybe the upper limit for adults is higher, but I'm not sure. For example, I've heard that the upper limit for the average is up to 100, but that's for certain conditions. Wait, but the question is about normal resting, which is probably the average. So 60-80 is the correct option.

The correct answer is D: 60-80 bpm. This range represents the average resting heart rate for adults at rest, reflecting a typical normal condition. 

Answer: D
