Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the Carnot efficiency of a steam turbine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the Carnot efficiency of a steam turbine. The turbine operates with steam at 300°C and discharges at 80°C. Oh, right, because Carnot is the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two temperatures.

So, the formula for Carnot efficiency is η = 1 - (Tc/Th), where Tc is the cold reservoir temperature and Th is the hot reservoir temperature. But wait, I need to make sure the units are in Kelvin because the formula uses Kelvin.

Right, the question gives temperatures in Celsius. So I should convert those. Let me get the numbers right. Th is 300°C, which is 300 + 273.15 = 573.15 K. Tc is 80°C, so 80 + 273.15 is 353.15 K.

Plugging into the formula: η = 1 - (353.15 / 573.15). Let me calculate that. Let's see, 353.15 divided by 573.15. Hmm, I think that's approximately 0.615. So 1 minus 0.615 is about 0.385. Oh wait, but wait, let me double-check the division.

Wait, 353.15 / 573.15. Maybe I can compute it more accurately. Let's see, 573.15 divided by 353.15 is roughly 1.619. But wait, no, that's the other way. Let me compute 353.15 divided by 573.15 as a decimal. Let me approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to do 573.15 minus 353.15, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 353.15 is about two-thirds of 526.5, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps more accurately, let's compute.

Wait, 353.15 * 3 = 1059.45. 573.15 is about 1.96 * 300 (since 300 * 1.96 is 588, which is a bit higher than 573). Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me just compute 353.15 ÷ 573.15.

Let me do it step by step. 573.15 is the denominator. Let's compute 353.15 ÷ 573.15.

Well, 353.15 is approximately 353.15, and 573.15 is about 573.15. So 353.15 ÷ 573.15 is roughly 0.615. So 1 - 0.615 is 0.385.

Wait, but the options are A: 0.33, B: 0.25, C: 0.45, D: 0.60, E: 0.55, F: 0.40, G:0.42, H:0.38, I:0.28, J:0.50.

Looking at option H, which is 0.38. Oh, but wait, I had 0.385. So maybe the closest option is H) 0.38. But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Let's compute 353.15 / 573.15 exactly. Let me do that.

353.15 ÷ 573.15 = ?

Let me compute it as 353.15 ÷ 573.15 = 0.615 approximately.

So 1 - 0.615 = 0.385.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.38, which is close to 0.385. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to be more precise.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Oh, wait, wait a second. Wait, 300°C is 573.15 K, and 80°C is 353.15 K. So the formula is 1 - (353.15/573.15) = 1 - 0.615 = 0.385.

But the given options don't have 0.385. The closest is 0.38 (H) and 0.385 would be 0.385. So perhaps the correct answer is H) 0.38.

Wait, but wait, the options include G: 0.42, which is higher than 0.385. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 353.15 / 573.15 as an exact decimal.

Let me compute 353.15 divided by 573.15.

Let me write that as 35315/57315. Let me simplify that fraction. Let's see if both numbers are divisible by 5: 35315 ÷5 = 7063; 57315 ÷5= 11463.

So now I have 7063 / 11463.

Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me perform the division.

Wait, 573.15 is approximately 573.15, and 353.15 is approximately 353.15.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed with approximation.

Another approach: 573.15 is about 573. So 353.15 / 573 is approximately 0.615. So 1 - 0.615 = 0.385.

Hmm, but none of the options have 0.385. So the closest is H:0.38, which is 0.38, which is 0.005 less than 0.385. But perhaps the intended approach is to use rounded numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, another approach: 353.15 ÷ 573.15.

Let me approximate 353.15 as 353.15, and 573.15 as 573.15.

So, 353.15 / 573.15 = approx 0.615.

Let me compute it precisely:

573.15 × 0.6 = 343.89

573.15 × 0.61 = 573.15 * 0.6 =343.89 plus 573.15 *0.01 =5.7315 → total 349.6215.

Wait, 0.615 is 0.6 + 0.015.

So 0.615 *573.15 = ?

0.6 *573.15 =343.89.

0.015 *573.15 = 8.59725.

So sum is 343.89 +8.59725=352.48725.

So 352.48725 is 0.615 *573.15.

But our numerator is 353.15, which is 0.66775 higher than 352.48725 (0.66775=353.15-352.48725).

So 0.615 + (0.66775 /573.15) → 0.615 + (approx 0.00117).

So 0.615 + 0.00117 ≈ 0.61617.

So 353.15/573.15 ≈0.61617 → 1-0.61617=0.38383.

Wait, that's approximately 0.3838. So the Carnot efficiency is about 38.38% → 0.3838.

Looking back at the options, the closest is H:0.38, which is 0.38, but the actual value is 0.3838. So perhaps the intended answer is H, 0.38.

But wait, let's see the options again. The options are:

A:0.33, B:0.25, C:0.45, D:0.60, E:0.55, F:0.40, G:0.42, H:0.38, I:0.28, J:0.50.

So H is 0.38, which is 0.3838 to four decimal places. So that's probably the intended answer.

To calculate the Carnot efficiency of the steam turbine, we use the formula:

\[
\eta = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}
\]

where \( T_c \) is the cold reservoir temperature and \( T_h \) is the hot reservoir temperature. The given temperatures are \( T_h = 300^\circ \mathrm{C} \) and \( T_c = 80^\circ \mathrm{C} \). To convert these to Kelvin:

\[
T_h = 300 + 273.15 = 573.15 \, \mathrm{K}, \quad T_c = 80 + 273.15 = 353.15 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\eta = 1 - \frac{353.15}{573.15}.
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{353.15}{573.15} \):

\[
\frac{353.15}{573.15} \approx 0.616.
\]

Thus:

\[
\eta = 1 - 0.616 = 0.384.
\]

The calculated Carnot efficiency is approximately \( 0.384 \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( 0.38 \) (option H). Therefore, the Carnot efficiency of the steam turbine is:
