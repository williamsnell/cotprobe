Okay, so I've got this question here about angles and circles. The question asks, "What is the measure of an angle that turns through 3/4 of a complete circle?" And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that a complete circle is 360 degrees. So if the question is asking for 3/4 of a circle, I should calculate three quarters of 360 degrees. Let me do the math: 3/4 of 360. 

Let me break it down. 360 divided by 4 is 90. So 90 multiplied by 3 is 270. So 3/4 of 360 is 270 degrees. 

Looking at the options, option C is 270°. That seems to fit. Wait, let me double-check. Oh, yeah, 360 divided by 4 is 90, times 3 is 270. So 270 degrees is the measure. 

I don't see any other options that make sense. The other options are like 180° (which is a semicircle, half), 270° (which is three quarters), 120° (which is a third), 90° (a quarter), etc. So the correct answer must be C.

The measure of an angle that turns through 3/4 of a complete circle is calculated by finding 3/4 of 360 degrees. 

3/4 of 360° = (360° × 3) / 4 = 270°.

The correct answer is **C: 270°**.
