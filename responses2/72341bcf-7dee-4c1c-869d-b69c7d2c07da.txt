Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the smallest positive integer that leaves specific remainders when divided by different numbers. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says:
- It leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.
- A remainder of 2 when divided by 3.
- A remainder of 3 when divided by 4.
- A remainder of 4 when divided by 5.
- And a remainder of 5 when divided by 6.

Hmm, so I think I can approach this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or maybe look for a pattern. But since the divisors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which are all consecutive numbers, perhaps there's a smarter way to find the number.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can express each condition mathematically. Let's see.

If the number is N, then:
N ≡ 1 mod 2 → N = 2k + 1 for some integer k.
N ≡ 2 mod 3 → N = 3m + 2.
N ≡ 3 mod 4 → N =4n +3.
N ≡4 mod5 → N=5p +4.
N≡5 mod6 → N=6q +5.

Looking for the smallest N that satisfies all these.

Wait a second, looking at the remainders, I notice a pattern. For each divisor d, N leaves a remainder of d-1. Because 2-1=1, 3-1=2, etc. So N ≡ d-1 mod d.

Wait, so for each modulus d, N ≡ -1 mod d, right? Because d-1 = (-1) mod d.

So N ≡ -1 mod 2, -1 mod3, -1 mod4, -1 mod5, and -1 mod6.

So N ≡ -1 mod LCM(2,3,4,5,6). Because the moduli are not all pairwise coprime, the least common multiple (LCM) of all of them will give the period after which the pattern repeats.

Let me compute the LCM of 2,3,4,5,6.

The prime factors:
2: 2
3: 3
4: 2²
5:5
6:2×3.

So the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present: 2² × 3 ×5 =4×3×5=60.

So the pattern repeats every 60 numbers. So any N that satisfies the conditions will be N = 60k -1, where k is a positive integer.

So possible N values are 59, 119, 179, 239, etc.

Now, I need the smallest positive integer, so the first one is 59.

But wait, let me check if 59 fits all the conditions.

Check N=59.

59 divided by 2: 2×29=58, remainder 1. Correct.
59 divided by3: 3×19=57, remainder 2. Correct.
59 divided by4:4×14=56, remainder 3. Correct.
59 divided by5:5×11=55, remainder4. Correct.
59 divided by6:6×9=54, remainder5. Correct.

So 59 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies all the given conditions. Looking at the options, option A is 59. So the answer should be A.

The smallest positive integer that satisfies all the given conditions is 59.

Answer: A: 59
