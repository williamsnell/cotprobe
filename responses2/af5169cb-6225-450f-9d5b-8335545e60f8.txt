Question:

What is one reason why the government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry?

Options:

A: Joint profit maximization leads to a decrease in consumer surplus as the price falls below competitive levels.
B: Collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price down to competitive levels.
C: Collusion between large firms leads to an increase in consumer surplus.
D: Collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price above competitive levels.
E: Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.
F: Collusive output levels tend to decrease, driving the price down to competitive levels.
G: Collusion between large firms leads to an oversupply in the market.
H: Consumer surplus falls as the price is driven downward.
I: Joint profit maximization leads to a decrease in market competition.
J: Collusion between large firms leads to a decrease in consumer demand.

Okay, so I have this question about why the government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry. Hmm, I remember that collusion is when big companies in the same industry work together, usually to raise prices. But why is that bad for the government?

Let me think... I think it's because when firms collude, they might set higher prices than they could if they weren't working together. If the price is too high, consumers would pay more, which is bad for them. Also, I remember something about joint profit maximization. Wait, joint profit maximization is when multiple firms work together to maximize their joint profits. But if they do that, they might drive prices up because each firm's profit is maximized collectively.

So, when they set higher prices, the consumer surplus goes down because people are paying more than they'd otherwise. That makes sense. But why does the government care? Well, if the price is too high, it's not a good deal for consumers, and it might even harm the economy if it's too high. So, the government probably discourages collusion to protect consumers.

Looking at the options, option B says collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price down to competitive levels. That aligns with what I was thinking. So B is probably the correct answer.

But wait, option C says collusion increases consumer surplus, which would be bad. So C is not correct. Option D says output increases and price goes above competitive. Oh, that's similar to B, but with price above. But why would that happen? I thought collusion could drive prices up, but maybe sometimes it reduces competition. Hmm, but the main point is that the government discourages it because it will raise prices, which isn't good for consumers.

Another point is joint profit maximization leading to higher prices because each firm's profit is maximized collectively. So the government wants to protect consumers, so they don't allow this. Thus, option B seems correct.

The correct answer is B: Collusive output levels tend to increase, driving the price down to competitive levels.
