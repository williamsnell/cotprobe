Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says: The price level in the United States has risen in the past year but production of goods and services has remained constant. Based on this information, which of the following is true? We're looking at nominal GDP and real GDP.

Hmm. Let me break this down. I remember that the price level is the overall change in prices and services over time, measured by the CPI or something. So if the price level has risen, that means the general prices have gone up over the year.

Now, production is constant. That means the actual output (like the number of goods produced) hasn't changed. So, production is the same as last year.

I need to find how nominal GDP and real GDP have changed. Let's think about the definitions.

Nominal GDP is the value of all finished goods and services produced in a given year, evaluated at current prices. So, it's using the current year's prices. If the price level rose, but production remained the same, then nominal GDP would increase because the prices went up, even though the quantity didn't change.

Real GDP, on the other hand, is the value of all goods and services produced in a year, adjusted for inflation. It's calculated using the prices of a base year. Since the price level has risen (so the base year prices are lower now), real GDP would decrease. Because 2020 nominal GDP is higher than 2019 real GDP, when the price level went up.

So putting it together: Nominal GDP increased (because prices went up, but quantities stayed same), Real GDP decreased (because prices rose, but real GDP uses base year prices).

Looking at the options, option B says both increased, which can't be right. Option E says increased and decreased, which matches our conclusion. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: No change no change – no, because the price level changed.

B: Increased, Increased – no, since real GDP would decrease.

C: Decreased, Decreased – no, because real GDP decreases.

D: Increased, No change – no, because real GDP decreased.

E: Increased, Decreased – yes, that's what I thought.

F: No change Decreased – no, because both changed.

G: Decreased, No change – no, same reason as F.

H: Decreased, Increased – no, because real GDP decreases, not increases.

I: No change Increased – no, because real GDP changes.

J: Not sure, but I think I've got E.

So the correct answer should be option E.

The correct answer is E, where nominal GDP increased and real GDP decreased.

**Answer: E**
