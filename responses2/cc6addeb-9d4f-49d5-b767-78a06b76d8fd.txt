Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about China's military spending on GDP. Let me start by recalling what I know about China's economy and its military spending.

I remember that China is a large country, so its military spending might be a significant portion of its GDP. But how much exactly? I think I've heard that China's economy is one of the largest in the world, so maybe its military expenditure is a substantial percentage of GDP.

Wait, the options are A through J with various percentages. I'm trying to remember the exact value. I think China's military expenditure on GDP is around 8%, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think more carefully.

I recall that China's GDP grew steadily over the years, and its military spending has been a part of that. In recent years, especially post-reform, the military might have been a larger portion of the economy. I think in 2017, the share was around 8%. Let me confirm that.

Alternatively, I think that China's military expenditure can vary a bit. For example, during the War of Resistance, they increased their military spending. But I also know that the military's role in defense is more about controlling resources than just taking GDP. So, maybe the percentage is lower than the total military expenditure.

Wait, the question is about the share of GDP spent on the military. So, if China's military expenditure is a significant portion, then the percentage should be relatively high. I think I've heard it around 8%, which is option A. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes data might not be exactly as I remember.

Let me think about other factors. China's economy is heavily industrialized, but the military sector is a public service. In terms of GDP, defense spending can be a significant part, but not the largest. However, for a country with a large economy, such as China, the military expenditure might be a substantial percentage.

Looking at the options, 8% is one of them (Option A). Another thought: I might have mixed up China's military expenditure with another country's. For example, the United States' defense spending as a percentage of GDP is higher, like around 20%, but that's not China.

Wait, I think in 2017, China's military expenditure on GDP was about 8%. So, option A is correct.

The correct answer is A: 8%.
