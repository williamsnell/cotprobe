Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the scalar potential function for a given vector function A. The vector function is A = 2xy i + x² j + 3z² k. The options are A from A to J, each a different combination of terms plus a constant C.

First, I remember that a scalar potential function exists for a vector field if it's conservative. That means the vector field must be the gradient of some scalar function. So the vector field A should be equal to the gradient of that scalar function.

Let me recall what the gradient of a scalar function looks like. If the scalar function is φ(x, y, z), then the gradient ∇φ is (∂φ/∂x) i + (∂φ/∂y) j + (∂φ/∂z) k. So, for our vector A, each component must correspond to the partial derivatives of φ.

Looking at A:
- The i-component is 2xy. So ∂φ/∂x should be 2xy.
- The j-component is x². Thus, ∂φ/∂y should be x².
- The k-component is 3z². Hence, ∂φ/∂z should be 3z².

Now, let's integrate each of these partial derivatives to find φ.

Starting with the i-component: ∂φ/∂x = 2xy. Integrating with respect to x, we get φ = x² y + C(y, z). The C here is a constant that may depend on y and z.

Next, the j-component: ∂φ/∂y = x². Our current φ is x² y + C(y, z). Taking the partial derivative with respect to y gives x², which matches. So that's consistent. Now, the constant C in this case can only depend on z because any other variables (like x) are already accounted for. So C is a function of z only, say C(z).

So φ = x² y + C(z).

Now, moving on to the k-component: ∂φ/∂z = 3z². Our current φ is x² y + C(z). Taking the partial derivative with respect to z gives C’(z) = 3z². Integrating this with respect to z, we get C(z) = z³ + K, where K is a constant. Since constants can be absorbed into the overall constant C, we can ignore K.

So now, putting it all together, φ = x² y + z³ + C.

Looking at the options, option D is 2xy + z³ + C. Wait, wait a second. Let me check again.

Wait, one moment. Let me re-express the φ. Oh, wait, I have x² y. The option D is 2xy + z³ + C. Hmm, but wait, according to my calculation, the i-component was 2xy. So ∂φ/∂x is 2xy, which comes from the derivative of x² y. So the i-component matches.

But wait, in my calculation, φ = x² y + z³ + C. So the j-component has ∂φ/∂y = x², which is correct because the j-component of A is x².

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is 2xy + z³ + C. Wait, so the term x² y in my φ is different from 2xy in option D. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in integrating. Let's go again.

The i-component is 2xy. The derivative of x² y with respect to x is 2xy. So that's correct.

The j-component is x². The derivative of x² y (from φ) with respect to y is x², which matches.

The k-component is 3z². The derivative of z³ is 3z².

Wait, so φ is x² y + z³ + C. But looking at the options, option D is 2xy + z³ + C. Oh! Wait, so 2xy is different from x² y. So perhaps I made a mistake in integrating.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if ∂φ/∂x is 2xy, then integrating that with respect to x should give me φ = x² y + f(y,z). So the x² y part is correct. Then, the j-component gives me no new information beyond confirming that f(y,z) is a function of z only.

So the partial φ/∂y is x², which doesn't involve any y dependence, which fits with f(y,z) possibly being a function of z only.

So, the correct φ is x² y + z³ + C, but looking at the options, that's not one of them. Wait, let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2x²y + 3z³ + C

B: x²y + z³ + C

C: xy² + z³ + C

D: 2xy + z³ + C

E: x² + y² + z² + C

F: 2xy + x² + 3z² + C

G: 2xy² + z² + C

H: x²y + 3z² + C

I: x²y² + z³ + C

J: x²y + z² + C

Wait, so my φ is x² y + z³ + C. But none of the options have x² y. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the i-component. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the i-component is 2xy. So when I integrate that with respect to x, I get x² y + a function of y and z. So φ = x² y + f(y,z).

Now, the j-component is x². The derivative of φ with respect to y is x², which is correct. So f(y,z) can only depend on z, since any y dependence would have come through.

So f(y,z) = function of z, say g(z).

Thus, φ = x² y + g(z).

Now, the k-component is 3z². The partial derivative of φ with respect to z is g’(z). So g’(z) = 3z². Integrating that, g(z) = z³ + C.

So φ = x² y + z³ + C.

But looking at the options, which one matches this? Option D is 2xy + z³ + C. Hmm, but I have x² y instead of 2xy. So that's a discrepancy. That suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misread the vector function. Let me double-check.

The vector function is A = 2xy i + x² j +3z² k. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, so according to this, the correct φ would be x² y + z³ + C. But none of the options have x² y. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the vector field is not conservative, but the options suggest that one of them is. So perhaps I made a mistake in my integration.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should check whether the vector field is indeed conservative by computing the curl. If curl A is zero, then it's conservative.

The curl of A is given by the determinant:

|i    j    k|
|∂/∂x  ∂/∂y  ∂/∂z|
|2xy  x²  3z²|

Calculating the determinant:

i*( ∂(3z²)/∂y - ∂(x²)/∂z ) - j*( ∂(3z²)/∂x - ∂(2xy)/∂z ) + k*( ∂(x²)/∂x - ∂(2xy)/∂y )

Compute each component:

i: (0 - 0) = 0.

j: -( (0 - 0) ) = 0.

k: (2x - 2x) = 0.

So the curl is zero. Thus the vector field is conservative, and there exists a scalar potential function.

So my initial approach is correct. So why does it not match any option?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in integrating. Let me re-express.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the integration step.

The i-component is 2xy, which integrates with respect to x to x² y + f(y,z).

The j-component is x². But when we take the partial of φ with respect to y, it's x², which doesn't depend on y, which is consistent with f(y,z) being a function of z only. So f(y,z) = g(z).

Thus, φ = x² y + g(z).

Then the k-component is 3z², so the partial derivative of φ with respect to z is g’(z) = 3z² → g(z) = z³ + C.

Thus, φ = x² y + z³ + C.

But none of the options have x² y. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me look again.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, perhaps I got the i and j components mixed up. Let me think.

Wait, the vector function A is given as 2xy i + x² j + 3 z² k. So that's correct.

So, the i component is 2xy. So when I integrate that with respect to x, I get x² y + f(y,z).

The j component is x², which is the derivative of x² y + f(y,z) with respect to y, which is x², so that's correct. So f(y,z) must be a function of z only: f(y,z) = g(z).

So φ = x² y + g(z).

Now, taking the partial derivative of φ with respect to z: dφ/dz = g’(z) = 3 z² → g(z) = z³ + C.

Thus, φ = x² y + z³ + C.

But looking at the options, none have x² y. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the integration. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the initial components are misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the vector function is A = 2xy i + x² j + 3 z² k. So the i component is correct.

Wait, but option D is 2xy + z³ + C. Hmm, but according to my calculation, the i component is 2xy, which would require that x² y is the term. But in option D I have 2xy. So unless x² y is somehow equal to 2xy, which would only be true if x is 1 or something, which is not generally the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the vector function is not the same as I thought. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The vector function is A = 2xy i + x^2 j + 3 z² k.

Wait, perhaps I mistakenly thought that the i component is 2xy, but in the problem statement, it's written as 2xy. So no, that's correct.

Wait, then according to my calculation, the correct scalar potential is x² y + z³ + C. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe I should check if I forgot some of the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should take the partial derivatives again.

Wait, if φ = x² y + z³ + C, then:

dφ/dx = 2x y.

dφ/dy = x².

dφ/dz = 3 z².

Which matches the vector function A. So the potential is correct.

Looking at the options again, option D is 2xy + z³ + C, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the correct option.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: maybe the i component is 2xy, so when I integrate with respect to x, I get x² y + f(y,z).

Then, the j component is x². So when I take the partial of φ with respect to y, I get x², which is correct. So that's fine.

Then, the k component is 3z², so the partial of φ with respect to z is 3 z² → g’(z) = 3 z² → g(z) = z³ + C. So φ = x² y + z³ + C.

So none of the options match this, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me check the options again. Did I misread any of them?

Looking at option D: 2xy + z³ + C. So the i component should be 2xy, but according to my calculation, it's x² y. So perhaps I made a mistake in the integration.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Let me think again about the integration.

Wait, perhaps I should have integrated the i component 2xy as x² y, but maybe if I have a different setup, I could have different terms.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should think about the vector field components as the gradients of each part.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about each option and see which one when differentiated gives A.

Option D: φ = 2xy + z³ + C.

dφ/dx = 2y.

But the i component of A is 2xy. So that doesn't match. So option D is incorrect.

Option B: φ = x² y + z³ + C.

dφ/dx = 2x y.

Which matches the i component. dφ/dy = x², matches j component. dφ/dz = 3z², matches k component.

Wait, so option B's potential function gives the correct derivatives. So why did I get x² y + z³ + C when I did the integration?

Ah, because I might have made a mistake in the integration steps. Wait, perhaps I had the i-component as 2xy, and when I integrate that with respect to x, I get x² y + f(y,z). But let's think: if i-component is 2xy, then integrating with x gives x² y + f(y,z). The j-component is x², which is the derivative of x² y + f(y,z) w.r. to y. So x² y's derivative is x², which matches. So f(y,z) must be a function of z only. Hence, φ = x² y + f(z).

Then, the k-component is 3z²: so dφ/dz = f’(z) = 3 z² → f(z) = z³ + C. So φ = x² y + z³ + C.

But wait, but option B's potential function is x² y + z³ + C, which is correct. So my earlier conclusion that option D was correct was wrong.

Wait, wait, no. Because when I computed phi as x² y + z³ + C, the gradient is 2xy i + x² j + 3z² k, which matches the vector A. So why do I think that option B is the correct one?

Wait, no, option B is x² y + z³ + C, which when differentiated gives correct i, j, and k components. So why am I getting a different phi?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me redo the integration.

Integrate the i component 2xy with respect to x: integral of 2xy dx is x² y + f(y,z).

Then, take the partial derivative of this with respect to y: ∂(x² y)/∂y = x², which matches the j-component of A. So no new information about f(y,z).

So, f(y,z) can be any function of z only. Now, take the partial of φ with respect to z: ∂(x² y + f(z))/∂z = f’(z) = 3 z² → f(z) = z³ + C.

Thus, φ = x² y + z³ + C.

So according to this, the correct potential function is x² y + z³ + C. But looking at the options, option B is x² y + z³ + C, which would be the correct one. But wait, earlier I thought that option D was correct because I thought the i-component was 2xy, but that would lead to the potential being 2xy + z³ + C, which is option D. But that can't be because the j-component doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I integrated.

Wait, perhaps the j-component is x², but in the potential function, when I integrate the j-component, I get x² y from the i-component, but then for the j-component, I have x² as the derivative of phi w.r. to y. So phi is x² y + f(y,z), and when I take ∂(phi)/∂y, I get x², which is correct. So f(y,z) can be any function of z.

So, the phi is x² y + z³ + C. So option B is x² y + z³ + C. So according to that, the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but earlier when I thought I integrated correctly, I got phi = x² y + z³ + C, which is option B, and that matches the vector A.

Ah, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought I was getting option D. But no, because according to this, option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier when I thought I had x² y, I thought that was correct, but now I'm seeing that option B is correct.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in my prior analysis. Let me clarify.

The vector function A is 2xy i + x^2 j + 3z² k.

The correct potential function is obtained by integrating each component, ensuring that all the partial derivatives match.

So, integrating 2xy i: x² y + f(y,z).

The j-component is x^2, which when taking the derivative w.r. to y gives x^2, which matches x² y's derivative. So no problem here.

The k-component is 3 z². So when you take the derivative of phi with respect to z, it's f’(z) = 3 z² → f(z) = z³ + C.

Thus, phi = x² y + z³ + C.

Looking at the options, option B is x² y + z³ + C, which is correct.

Earlier, I thought option D was correct, but that was a mistake because I thought the i-component was 2xy, but in reality, the i-component is 2xy, and the j-component is x². So the potential function is x² y + z³ + C.

Thus, the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The vector function is given as:

**A = 2xy i + x² j + 3z² k**

To find the scalar potential function **φ(x, y, z)**, we integrate each component of **A**:

1. Integrate the **i**-component **2xy** with respect to **x**:

   \[
   \int 2xy \, dx = x^2 y + f(y, z)
   \]

2. The **j**-component is **x²**, which must match the derivative of **x² y + f(y, z)** with respect to **y**:

   \[
   \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (x^2 y + f(y, z)) = x^2 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
   \]

   Since this equals **x²**, there is no constraint on **f(y, z)** beyond it being a function of **z**.

3. The **k**-component is **3z²**, which must match the derivative of **φ** with respect to **z**:

   \[
   \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z} (x^2 y + f(z)) = f'(z) = 3z^2
   \]

   Integrating this gives:

   \[
   f(z) = z^3 + C
   \]

Putting it all together, the scalar potential function is:

\[
\phi = x^2 y + z^3 + C
\]

Now, we compare this result with the given options:

- **Option B**: \(2xy + z^3 + C\)

The correct potential function is **\(x^2 y + z^3 + C\)**, which matches **Option B**.
