Okay, so I've got this question about land use and how it affects transfer earnings and economic rent. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

From what I remember, when a land has only a single use, it means that the land is used for a specific purpose, like a factory or a office building. In this scenario, the land isn't used for multiple things, so there's no competition for its use. That must mean that the land's value is tied directly to its use, not to its availability for other uses.

Transfer earnings are the profits a seller gets when using land for their own business rather than renting it out. Like, if I rent out a piece of land, I get the rental income. But if I own the land, I can choose to use it for more than just the rental purpose, so I get transfer earnings. Right?

Economic rent is a bit tricky. I think it's the minimum price someone is willing to pay for land, considering all its uses. If the land is only used for one purpose, the economic rent would be higher because the seller has no other options. But wait, in a single-use land, maybe the economic rent equals the transfer earnings? Or maybe not.

Wait, let's get this straight. When land is single-use, the land's price is determined by what's needed for that specific use. For example, a factory might require a lot of land for construction. If that land is only used in the factory, then the land's price is based on the factory's needs. So, the economic rent would be the price of the land minus any transfer earnings. Because the land is being used for a business, the seller gets transfer earnings.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think about how land valuation works. In general, when a land is used in a way that generates profits (like a business), the land's value increases because the seller can charge more for it. So, if a land is only for business (single use), the economic rent would be equal to the transfer earnings because the land's value is directly tied to the business use.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Price is entirely transfer earnings. That suggests that economic rent is zero, which doesn't make sense because the land's value is tied to the business use, so there should be some economic rent.

Option B: Economic rent remains constant, transfer earnings fluctuate. Hmm, not sure about this. If land is single-use, I think the land's value (and thus economic rent) would remain the same if there's no change in demand. So economic rent wouldn't change, and transfer earnings would be based on how much the land is used for.

Wait, perhaps that's not how it works. If land is only used for one purpose, the economic rent is the price of the land minus any transfer earnings. Because the seller can charge the transfer earnings plus whatever is needed for the use.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me remember the concept of economic rent. Economic rent is the minimum price someone would pay to use land, considering all uses. If the land is used for one purpose, the economic rent is the price of the land minus any transfer earnings.

Wait, another approach: when land is used for one purpose, the land's value is based on that use. So, if someone owns land that's only used for business, their transfer earnings would be the value of the land minus economic rent. Because the value of the land is the minimum they would accept (economic rent) plus any profit they make (transfer earnings).

Wait, let me think of it in terms of an example. Suppose a piece of land is used only for a factory. The land's price is determined by what the factory needs. So the value of the land is economic rent plus transfer earnings. Because the land's value is the minimum the seller would accept (economic rent) plus the profit (transfer earnings) they get from using it for business.

So in this scenario, the price of the land is entirely made up of economic rent plus transfer earnings. But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. Let's look again.

Option C says transfer earnings are zero and the price is made up of economic rent. That can't be right because if the land is only used for business, the seller would have earned some transfer earnings.

Wait, but maybe in a single-use land, there's no competition, so the land's value is just based on the use. So the economic rent is the price of the land, and transfer earnings are zero. That would mean economic rent equals the price. But that doesn't seem right because land has value based on its uses, including the transfer earnings.

Wait, perhaps in a single use, there's no competition, so the price is determined by the need for the land for that use. So, the economic rent is the price of the land, and transfer earnings are zero. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: If a land is used for a single purpose, the value of the land is the minimum amount the seller would accept (economic rent) plus the profit (transfer earnings) they get from using it for business. So the price of the land (which is economic rent plus transfer earnings) is the sum of these two.

But none of the options directly state that. Let me look at the options again.

Option F: Transfer earnings decrease and economic rent increases. That doesn't make sense in a single-use scenario. Transfer earnings should increase, not decrease.

Option G: Both are zero. That can't be right because land has value, and if there's no use, it wouldn't have value.

Option D: Both increase proportionally. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps in a single-use land, the land's price is determined by its need, so economic rent is the price, and transfer earnings are zero. So the land's price is entirely economic rent.

Wait, but if the land is used for business, the seller can charge transfer earnings plus the economic rent. So the price would be economic rent plus transfer earnings. But if the land is only used for business, the economic rent is the price, so transfer earnings would be zero.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the land's price is determined by its use. So if the land is only used for business, the economic rent is the price, and transfer earnings are zero. Hence, the price is equal to economic rent.

Looking at the options, option C says transfer earnings are zero and price is made up of economic rent. That fits. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure. If a land is used for a single purpose, the land's price is based on the use, so economic rent would be the price, and transfer earnings are zero. So the price is made up solely of economic rent, and transfer earnings are zero.

So option C is correct.
</think>

When a land has only a single use, the land's value is tied directly to its use, and there is no competition for its use. This means that the land's price reflects the economic rent, which is the minimum price a seller would accept to use the land, considering all its uses. If the land is used solely for business purposes, the seller's transfer earnings (profits) would be the value of the land minus the economic rent. Therefore, the price of the land is entirely made up of economic rent, and transfer earnings are zero.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The price is not entirely made up of transfer earnings; economic rent is the price minus transfer earnings.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Economic rent remains constant unless land demand changes, and transfer earnings fluctuate with market demand.
- **Option C**: Correct. In a single-use land, transfer earnings are zero, and the price is made up of economic rent.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings increase, not decrease, and economic rent does not increase proportionally.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings and economic rent vary inversely, not directly.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings increase, not decrease.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Both cannot be zero.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings increase, not decrease.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Economic rent increases, not decreases.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings increase, not decrease.

The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately describes the scenario where transfer earnings are zero and the price is entirely made up of economic rent.
