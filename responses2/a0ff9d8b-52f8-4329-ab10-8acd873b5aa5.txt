Okay, so I have this wave equation problem here. Let me read it again. The equation is y = 6.0 sin(0.020π x + 4.0π t). And I need to find several properties of the wave: amplitude, wavelength, frequency, speed, direction, and maximum transverse speed.

Hmm, the equation of a wave is generally written as y = A sin(kx ± ωt + φ). I remember that A is the amplitude, which is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. So from the equation, A is 6.0 cm. So (a) should be 6 cm. Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J have a=6 cm. So the correct amplitudes are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Next is the wavelength. The formula I remember is the wave number k is 2π/λ. So in the equation, k is 0.020π. Let me compute λ. So k = (0.020π) = 2π / λ → λ = 2π / k. So λ = 2π / (0.020π) → the pi cancels. 2 / 0.020 → 100 cm. So λ is 100 cm. Let me check the options. A, B, C, D, E, F have b=100 cm. So (b) is 100 cm for options A, B, C, D, E, F.

Next is frequency. The angular frequency ω is 4.0π. The formula is ω = 2π f → f = ω/(2π). So f = (4.0π)/(2π) = 2.0 Hz. So (c) is 2 Hz. Looking at the options, A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J have c=2 Hz. So (c) is 2 Hz in those options. So options A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J are correct so far.

Now, the speed of the wave. The speed v is given by v = f λ. So f is 2 Hz, λ is 100 cm. So v = 2 * 100 = 200 cm/sec. So (d) is 200 cm/sec. Now, looking at the options, looking for (d) 200. Option A: d=200, E: d=200, I: d=200. So options A, E, I. Let me check other options.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to calculate v is using the formula v = ω/k. Because ω is 4π, k is 0.02π. So v=4π / 0.02π → the pi cancels, 4 / 0.02 → 200. Oh, right, same answer. So (d) is 200 cm/s. So that's correct.

Next, direction of propagation. The wave equation is y = A sin(kx + ωt). The general form is y = A sin(kx ± ωt), and the sign inside the sine determines the direction. If it's +, the wave is moving in the positive x-direction. If it's -, then it's moving in the negative x-direction, which is to the left. So in this case, the equation has +, so the wave is moving to the right. So (e) direction is to the right. Let's look at the options. A: to the right, E: to the right, I: to the left. So (e) is correct in options A, E, I.

Then, the maximum transverse speed of a particle. For a transverse wave, the maximum speed (v_max) is given by v_max = Aω. Because the velocity of the particle is the derivative of y with respect to time, which would be v = Aω cos(kx + ωt + φ), so the maximum is Aω.

So A=6 cm, ω=4π. So v_max = 6 * 4π = 24π cm/s. Wait, but let me compute that. 6 *4 is 24, times π. 24 *3.14 is about 75.36 cm/s. So approximately 75 cm/s. So looking for (f) 75 cm/sec. Looking at the options, option F has f=75, so (f) is 75 cm/s. So among options A, E, I, F is correct for (f).

Wait, let me check the options. Option F is a=6, b=50, c=0.5, d=100, e to the right, f=60. Hmm, oh wait, I thought (f) was 75 cm/s. But option F's (f) is 60 cm/s. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.

Wait, wave equation y = 6.0 sin(0.020πx +4.0πt). So ω=4π. A is 6 cm. So v_max = A * ω = 6 *4π = 24π cm/s. 24 * 3.14 is approximately 75.36 cm/s. So about 75 cm/s. So (f) should be 75 cm/s, which is in options A, E, I, F. But looking at F, (f) is 60, which is wrong. So let me check other options.

Looking at option E: a=6, b=100, c=2 Hz, d=200, e= to the left, f=75. So (f) is 75 cm/sec. That's correct. So E has (f) as 75. So E is a possible option.

Wait, but let me look at other options. Option I has (f) 60 cm/s, which is wrong. Option H: (f) 30 cm/s. No. Option D: (f) 60. No. So the correct (f) is 75 cm/s. So E is (e) right, (f) 75.

Wait, but wait, another approach: Let me compute v_max. So A is 6, ω is 4π. So v_max = 6 *4π = 24π cm/s. Let me compute 24 *3.1416 ≈ 75.398 cm/s. So approximately 75.4 cm/s. So 75 cm/s is correct.

So the options where (f) is 75 are E and F. F is (f)=60, so only E is correct. So (f) is in E.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is (a) 6, (b)50, (c) 0.5, (d)100, (e) right, (f)60. So (f) is 60, which is wrong for (f). So only option E has (f)=75.

But wait, E's (e) is to the left. Wait, the direction of wave is to the right, so (e) must be correct. Wait, earlier I thought (e) is correct, but in option E, (e) is to the left. So (e) is wrong for E. So wait, this is a problem. Because if (e) is to the left, but the wave is moving to the right, that's wrong. So that would imply that option E is wrong.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Let me reevaluate. So the wave equation is y = 6.0 sin(0.020π x +4.0π t). So the argument is kx + ωt. So, for a wave moving in the positive x-direction, the argument is kx - ωt. So in our case, it's kx + ωt. So the wave is moving in the negative x-direction, which is to the left. So (e) is to the left, which is correct. So should (e) be correct? Because the wave is moving to the left.

Wait, but earlier calculations. So wave equation is y = A sin(kx + ωt). So when we say kx + ωt, that's the same as k(x) + ω(t). So the wave is moving in the positive x direction when the equation is kx - ωt. But in this case, it's +ωt. So the wave is moving in the negative x direction, which is to the left. So (e) is correct.

So (e) is correct. So which option has (e) to the left? A, B, C, E, I, etc. So looking at the options, the correct (e) is present in options A, B, C, E, I.

So (e) is correct. So (f) is 75 cm/s, which is only in E and F. So (f) is 75 cm/s. So option E's (f) is 75, which is correct. So option E's (e) is to the left, (f) is 75 cm/s.

But wait, let me check the other options. Are there any other options with (e) to the left? Let's see.

Option A: (e) to the right. No.

Option B: (e) to the right. No.

Option C: (e) to the right. No.

Option D: (e) to the left. Yes, (e) is correct.

Option E: (e) to the left, (f) 75. So (e) is correct and (f) is correct.

Option F: (e) to the right, (f) 60. No.

So the correct option is E, because it has (e) to the left and (f) 75.

Wait a second, but earlier I thought that (f) is 75 cm/s, so E is correct for (f). So E has both (e) and (f) correct.

But wait, let's think: E's (e) is to the left, which is correct. (f) is 75 cm/s. So yeah, that's correct.

So the correct option is E.

But wait, why did I think earlier that (f) for E is 75? Because 24π is about 75.36 cm/s, which is approximately 75 cm/s. So (f) is 75.

So E is the correct one.
