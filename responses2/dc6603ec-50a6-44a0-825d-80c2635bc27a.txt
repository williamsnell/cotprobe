Question:

Select the single most accurate statement about the absorptive area of the human intestine?


Options:

A: All of the options given are correct
B: The absorptive area is reduced by the presence of folds, villi and microvilli
C: Changes in motility increase the contact time between nutrients and absorptive surface
D: The presence of folds, villi and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes reduces the absorptive area
E: The absorptive area is equivalent to that of a basketball court
F: The absorptive area is equivalent to that of a tennis court
G: Changes in motility decrease the contact time between nutrients and absorptive surface
H: The presence of folds, villi and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes magnifies the absorptive area
I: The absorptive area is equivalent to that of a football field
J: The absorptive area is equivalent to that of a baseball field

Okay, so I've got this question about the absorptive area of the human intestine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is the most accurate about the absorptive area. The options are A to J, each making a different claim. I remember that the absorptive area refers to how much surface is available for absorption of nutrients. It's the area where the intestinal lining (enterocytes) and the tiny structures inside (like villi and microvilli) make contact with the substrate they're absorbing from.

So, I know that villi and microvilli are these tiny structures in the intestinal lining. They are part of the duodenum and jejunum, respectively. These structures are packed closely together, increasing the surface area. Folds and villi also contribute to a larger surface area because they add more contact points. 

Looking at the options:

Option B says the absorptive area is reduced by folds, villi, and microvilli. Wait, no—the presence of these structures actually increases the absorptive area. So B is incorrect.

Option D states that the presence of folds, villi, and microvilli reduces the absorptive area. That's the opposite of what I remember, so D is wrong.

Option C mentions changes in motility increasing contact time. Oh, right! I remember that when the intestinal muscles contract, they get faster (motility). This increases the time the enterocytes are in contact with the substrate. So more contact time would mean a larger absorptive area. So C is correct.

Options A says all are correct, which can't be right because only one option is correct. So A is wrong.

Option E suggests the area is equivalent to a basketball court. I don't think that's right. A basketball court is big, but I don't remember the exact size. Or maybe it's a football field? Not sure, but I don't think the absorptive area is that big. Or maybe it's a baseball field; not sure.

Option F: equivalent to a tennis court. Tennis courts are actually big, but I'm not certain about the exact size. Also, the area might not be as big as a football field. Or maybe the opposite. I'm not certain about this one.

Option G says changes in motility decrease contact time. No, wait, more motility increases contact time. So G is wrong.

Option H: presence of folds, etc. magnifies the area. Wait, no— they increase the area, so the area is bigger, not magnified. Magnified would mean something like a lot bigger, but I don't think that's correct. So H is incorrect.

Option I: equivalent to a football field. Football fields are huge, but I'm not certain about the exact numbers. The area in the intestine is probably smaller than that, so I don't think this is right.

Option J: equivalent to a baseball field. Similarly, these are large, but I'm not sure if the area is that big. But I think the absorptive area is much smaller, so J is likely incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. The absorptive area is increased by the presence of villi and microvilli. So options D and B are wrong.

Looking for another angle. Option C says changes in motility increase contact time. Motility is contraction of the intestinal muscles, which are active. So when you're moving the walls faster, the time of contact with the substrate increases. So the contact time is longer, which makes the absorptive area larger. So statement C is correct.

What about option E and F? I'm not sure about their sizes, but I don't think the area is equivalent to a basketball or tennis court.

So the correct answer should be C.

The question asks for the most accurate statement about the absorptive area of the human intestine. The absorptive area refers to the surface area available for nutrient absorption, which is significantly increased by the presence of villi and microvilli in the intestinal lining. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Not all options are correct.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The presence of folds, villi, and microvilli increases the absorptive area, not decreases it.
- **Option C**: Correct. Changes in motility (increased contraction of intestinal muscles) lead to increased contact time between nutrients and the absorptive surface.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The presence of these structures increases the absorptive area, not reduces it.
- **Options E, F, G, H, I, J**: Incorrect. The absorptive area is not equivalent to the size of a basketball court, tennis court, football field, or baseball field.

Thus, the most accurate statement is **Option C**.

**ANSWER: C**
