Okay, so I've got this question about where Sun Ra, the jazz great, was born. I'm a bit rusty on jazz history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Sun Ra was a prominent jazz musician, but I'm not exactly sure about his birthplace. I think he was from a specific country, maybe North America or Europe. I'm trying to recall his background. Wait, I think he was born in the United States, but I'm not entirely sure which state or country. Hmm.

I remember that jazz musicians often come from various countries, but I'm not sure about Sun Ra. Let me think about the other answer choices. The options are Saturn, Atlantis, In a piano, Mount Olympus, Orion's Belt, New York City, Mars, the Moon, Venus, or the Sun. So, these are all different places.

Wait, one of the answer choices is the "Sun" symbol, which I think refers to Venus. But that's not a place. Oh wait, option J is Venus. Maybe the question is referring to the planet, not the name. But the question is about where he was born, so it should be a place, not a planet.

Looking at the options again, I can eliminate some. For example, Atlantis is a planet, and New York City is a US city. Saturn is a planet. The other options are either instruments or places. Wait, "in a saxophone" is option G, which seems unrelated.

Option I is the Moon, which is a celestial body, not a place. Option F is New York City. I'm trying to remember if I've heard that Sun Ra was born there. I think he was born in New York City. But wait, I'm not certain. Another thought: some people might confuse him with other musicians, but I'm pretty sure Sun Ra was from the US.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be F: New York City.
