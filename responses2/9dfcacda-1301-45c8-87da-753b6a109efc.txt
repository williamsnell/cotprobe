Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the storage needed for all the books in a university library. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the problem gives several assumptions. Let me list them out to keep track:

1. Libraries have 3 million books.
2. Each book has an average of 400 pages.
3. Each page has an average of 50 lines.
4. Each line contains 10 words.
5. Each word has 5 letters/characters.
6. Each character is represented by 1 byte.

Hmm, so I need to calculate the total number of bytes required for the entire collection based on these numbers.

Let me start by calculating the total number of pages. If each book has 400 pages and there are 3 million books, I multiply 400 by 3 million.

3,000,000 books * 400 pages/book = 1,200,000,000 pages. That's 1.2e9 pages.

Next, each page has 50 lines. So, the total number of lines is 1.2e9 pages * 50 lines/page. Let's compute that: 1.2e9 * 50 = 6e10 lines.

Each line has 10 words, so the total number of words is 6e10 lines * 10 words/line = 6e11 words.

Each word has 5 letters/characters, so the total number of characters is 6e11 * 5 = 3e12 characters.

Since each character is 1 byte, the total storage required is 3e12 bytes.

Now, I need to convert this into a unit that's commonly used for such large storage. The options provided are in powers of 10, so I'll compare 3e12 bytes to each option.

Looking at the options:

A: Kilobyte (10^3 bytes) → 1e9 bytes. Way too small.
B: Petabyte (10^15 bytes) → 1e15. Our calculation is 3e12, which is less than that.
C: Yottabyte (10^24 bytes) → 1e24. That's way bigger than needed.
D: Exabyte (10^18 bytes) → 1e18. Our value is 3e12, which is also less than that.
E: Byte → 1 byte. Nope, way too small.
F: Bit → 1/8 byte. Not relevant here.
G: Zettabyte (10^21) → 1e21. Still higher than needed.
H: Gigabyte (1e9) → 1e9. No.
I: Gigabyte (2^30 ≈ 1e9) → same as above.
J: Megabyte (1e6) → way too small.

Wait a second, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 3 million books times 400 pages is 1.2e9 pages. 50 lines per page: 1.2e9 *50 is 6e10 lines. Each line 10 words: 6e10 *10=6e11 words. 5 letters each: 6e11 *5=3e12.

Wait, 3e12 is 3 followed by 12 zeros. Each option is a different exponent.

Wait, 10^9 is a gigabyte, so 3e12 is 3,000 gigabytes. That's 3,000 GB. Let me think about what unit that is.

Wait, 1 terabyte is 1e12 bytes. Oh, wait no, let me correct that.

Actually, 1 terabyte is 1e12 bytes. So 3e12 bytes would be 3 terabytes.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are in exabytes, etc. So, 3e12 is 3 terabytes, which is 0.003 exabytes (since 1 exabyte is 1e18 bytes, 3e12 is 3e-6 exabytes, but perhaps expressed differently).

Wait, no. 1 terabyte is 10^12 bytes. So 3e12 bytes is 3 terabytes, which is 0.003 petabytes (since 1 petabyte is 1e15), but that's too small. Alternatively, 3e12 is 3e-6 exabytes, which is 0.003 exabytes, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, the exabyte is 1e18 bytes. So 3e12 is 3e-6 exabytes, but that's way smaller than each option. Wait, perhaps I misread the exponents.

Wait, option D is Exabyte (10^18 bytes), so 3e12 is 3e-6 of an exabyte. But that's a very small fraction, so perhaps the correct unit is terabytes, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

Wait, 3,000,000 books *400 pages=1,200,000,000 pages.

1,200,000,000 pages *50 lines/page=60,000,000,000 lines.

60,000,000,000 lines *10 words/line=600,000,000,000 words.

600,000,000,000 words *5 letters/word=3,000,000,000,000 letters.

Each letter is 1 byte, so 3e12 bytes.

Wait, but 1 terabyte is 10^12 bytes, so 3e12 is 3 terabytes. So the storage is 3 terabytes.

But looking at the options, the choices are in exabytes (D: 1e18), gigabytes (I: 1e9), etc.

Wait, 3 terabytes is 3e12. Let me see what that is in exabytes. Since 1 exabyte is 1e18 bytes, 3e12 bytes is 3e12 /1e18 = 3e-6 exabytes. But that's a tiny fraction.

Wait, but perhaps I got the unit conversions wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 exabyte is 1e18 bytes. So 3e12 bytes is 3e12 /1e18 = 3e-6 exabytes, which is 0.000003 exabytes. But that's way too small. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because I might have miscalculated the number of pages.

Wait, 3 million books *400 pages/book = 1,200,000,000 pages. Yes, that's correct.

1,200,000,000 *50 lines = 6e9 lines? Wait, wait: 1.2e9 *50 =6e10 lines. Oh, wait that's correct.

6e10 lines *10 words=6e11 words. 6e11 *5=3e12 letters. So 3e12 bytes.

Wait, this is 3 terabytes. So 3e12 bytes is 3 terabytes.

Wait, but looking at the options, the largest unit provided is the yottabyte (2^80 or ~1e24) and the petabyte (2^50 or ~1e15). So 3e12 is much less than a petabyte. So perhaps the correct answer is terabyte, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are: H is gigabyte (1e9), I is gigabyte, J is megabyte (1e6), A: KB (1e3), E: byte, F: bit, G: Yott, D: Exabyte, C: Zett, B: Pet, F: etc.

Wait, but the calculation gives 3e12 bytes, which is 3 terabytes. But the option D is Exabyte, which is 1e18. So 3e12 is 3e-6 exabytes. But that's a very small number, and the question is asking for the best unit to measure the storage.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, 3e6 books *400 pages/book =1.2e9 pages.

Each page has 50 lines: 1.2e9 *50 =6e10 lines.

Each line has 10 words: 6e10 *10 =6e11 words.

Each word 5 letters: 6e11 *5=3e12 words.

Each word is 1 byte: 3e12 bytes.

Convert bytes to exabytes: 1 exabyte is 1e18 bytes.

So 3e12 bytes / 1e18 bytes/exabyte = 3e-6 exabytes. So 0.000003 exabytes.

But looking at the options, the closest is D: Exabyte, but that's 1e18 bytes. 3e12 is much less than that.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me think again.

Wait, 3e12 bytes is equal to 3e12 / (1e9) = 3e3 gigabytes (GB). Oh, because 1 GB is 1e9 bytes. So 3e12 bytes is 3e3 gigabytes, which is 3,000 GB.

But looking at the options, the exabyte is 1e18 bytes. So 3e3 GB is 3e-15 exabytes. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think of the options again.

The question is about the best unit to measure the storage required. So I need to pick the unit that best represents 3e12 bytes.

Looking at the options:

A: KB (1e3)
B: PB
C: YB
D: EB (1e18)
E: B
F: bit
G: Yott (2^80 ~1e24)
H: GB (2^30 ~1e9)
I: GB
J: MB (2^20 ~1e6)
Options D is Exabyte (1e18), which is 10^18. Our value is 3e12, which is 3e-6 *1e18, so 3e-6 EB. But that's a very small fraction.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me re-calculate the total bytes.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the units. Let me count again.

Wait, 3e6 books, each with 400 pages: 3e6 *400 =1.2e9 pages.

Each page has 50 lines → 1.2e9 *50 =6e10 lines.

Each line has 10 words → 6e10 *10 =6e11 words.

Each word has 5 letters → 6e11 *5=3e12 letters.

Each letter is 1 byte → 3e12 bytes.

Yes, that's correct. So 3e12 bytes.

Wait, 3e12 bytes. Now, the exabyte is 1e18 bytes, so 3e12 is 3e-6 of an exabyte.

But the options don't have 3e-6 exabytes. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think in terms of exabytes.

Wait, 1 exabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1e18). So 3e12 is 3,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. Wait no, 3e12 is 3,000,000,000,000 bytes, which is 3e-6 exabytes.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering exa as 1e18, so 3e12 is 3e-6 of x exabytes, which is 0.000003 exabytes. But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of pages. Let me redo the numbers.

3,000,000 books → 3e6 books.

Each book has 400 pages → 3e6 *400 = 1.2e9 pages.

Each page has 50 lines → 1.2e9 *50 =6e10 lines.

Each line has 10 words →6e10 *10=6e11 words.

Each word has 5 letters →6e11 *5=3e12 letters.

Each letter is 1 byte →3e12 bytes.

So that's correct. So 3e12 bytes.

Wait, 1 petabyte is 1e15 bytes. 3e12 is 3e-3 petabytes (since 3e12 /1e15 = 3e-3). So 0.003 petabytes.

But 3e12 is 3e-6 exabytes (since 1e18 is a million exabytes... no, wait: 1 exabyte is 1e18, so 1e18 is a million exabytes, no).

Wait, no, that's not right. 1 exabyte is 1e18 bytes. So 3e12 bytes is much less than 1 exabyte.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute 3e12 / (1e18) → 3e-6 exabytes. But none of the options except D: Exabyte (1e18) is an option. So 3e12 is 3e-6 exabytes, which is 0.000003 exabytes. But the question is looking for the best unit. So perhaps the exabyte is the best fit, but 3e12 is a third of 1e15 (petabyte) and a third of a trillion bytes.

Wait, but another way: 3e12 is 3,000,000,000,000 bytes. Let me see how that compares with each option.

Option D: Exabyte is 1e18. So D is 1e18, which is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. 3e12 is way smaller, so 3e12 is 3e-6 of D's size.

Wait, but perhaps the options are using different scales. Let me see the options again:

Options are:

A: KiloByte (1e3)
B: Petabyte (2^50 or ~1e15)
C: Yott (2^80 or ~1e24)
D: Exabyte (1e18)
E: Byte (1)
F: Bit (1/8)
G: Zett (2^70 or ~1e21)
H: Gig (2^30 or ~1e9)
I: GB (2^30 or ~1e9)
J: MB (2^20 or ~1e6)

So, the exabyte is 1e18. So 3e12 is 3e-6 of an exabyte. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is the closest, which is not present. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should look for the correct exponents. Let me recount the exponents:

Wait, 3e12 is 3 trillion bytes.

Wait, 1 exabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1e18). So 3e12 is 3e-6 exabytes. But the options don't have 3e-6 exabytes. But perhaps the correct unit is terabytes, which is 1e12. 3e12 is 3 terabytes.

But looking at the options, the largest unit is Exabyte, but it's 1e18. So 3e12 is smaller than that, but perhaps the best fit is Exabyte.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake because 3e12 is 3e12, which is 3e-6 of an exabyte, which is 0.000003 exabytes. But that's not an option. So perhaps the best unit is terabytes, which is 1e12. 3e12 is 3 terabytes.

Wait, but the options don't include terabytes. The closest is option D: Exabyte (1e18). So perhaps the best unit is terabytes, but it's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I should re-do the math with exponents:

Each book is 400 pages → 4e2.

Each page has 50 lines → 5e1.

Each line has 10 words → 1e1.

Each word has 5 letters → 5e0.

So, the total per book is 4e2 *5e1 *1e1 *5e0 = (4e2) * (5e1) = 2e3; 2e3 *1e1=2e4; 2e4 *5e0=1e5. So per book, 1e5 bytes.

3e6 books → 3e6 *1e5 =3e11 bytes.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation was 3e12. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let me compute exponents again:

Each page is 50 lines → 5e1.

Each line is 10 words →5e1.

Each word is 5 letters →5e1.

So, per page, the lines, words, letters are 5e1 *5e1 *5e1 = (5^3) * (e^(1+1+1)) )=125 *e3 → 1.25e5 per page.

Each book has 400 pages →4e2. So each book's storage is 4e2 *1.25e5 =5e7 bytes.

Wait, 5e7 is 50 million bytes. Wait, 3e6 books times 5e7 per book is 1.5e14 bytes.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation, but let me continue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me count per page: 5e1 (lines) *5e1 (words) *5e1 (letters) =5^3 *e^(1+1+1)=125 *e3 →1.25e5 per page.

Each book has 400 pages →4e2 →400 pages. So per book: 4e2 *1.25e5 = (4e2) * (1.25e5) =5e7 bytes.

3e6 books →3e6 *5e7 =1.5e14 bytes.

Wait, but that's way larger than my initial calculation. So which one is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial per-page calculation. Let me recompute per page:

Each page has 50 lines →5e1.

Each line has 10 words →5e1.

Each word has 5 letters →5e1.

So per page, it's 5e1 *5e1 *5e1 = (5^3) * (e3) →125e3 →1.25e5 per page.

Each book has 400 pages →4e2.

So per book, 4e2 *1.25e5 = (4e2) * (1.25e5) =5e7 bytes.

3e6 books →3e6 *5e7 =1.5e14 bytes.

Wait, that's 1.5e14 bytes. Now, what's that in exabytes?

1 exabyte is 1e18 bytes. So 1.5e14 bytes is 1.5e-4 exabytes, which is 0.00015 exabytes.

But again, none of the options seem to fit that. The options are A to J, with D being Exabyte.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of the storage. Let me think again.

Another approach: let's calculate the storage step by step.

- 3e6 books.

- Each book has 400 pages → 3e6 *400 =1.2e9 pages.

- Each page has 50 lines →1.2e9 *50 =6e10 lines.

- Each line has 10 words →6e10 *10 =6e11 words.

- Each word has 5 letters →6e11 *5 =3e12 letters.

- Each letter is 1 byte →3e12 bytes.

Wait, 3e12 bytes is equal to 3e12 /1e18 =3e-6 exabytes.

But the options don't have 3e-6 exabytes. The closest is D: Exabyte, which is 1e18.

So 3e12 is 3e-6 of an Exabyte, which is 0.000003 exabytes. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pages. Let me recheck.

3e6 books *400 pages/book =1.2e9 pages.

Yes, correct.

Each page 50 lines: 1.2e9 *50 =6e10 lines.

Each line 10 words: 6e10 *10 =6e11 words.

Each word 5 letters: 6e11 *5=3e12 letters.

Each letter 1 byte: 3e12 bytes.

So 3e12 bytes is correct.

Wait, but the options are in exabytes (D:1e18), gigabytes (H:1e9), etc. So 3e12 is 3e-6 of D's unit, which is 0.000003 exabytes.

But this is not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that each page is 50 lines, each line is 10 words, each word is 5 letters, each letter is 1 byte. So 3e6 books.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the storage in each step.

Let me compute the storage for each part:

- 3e6 books: each book is 400 pages.

- Each page is 50 lines.

- Each line is 10 words.

- Each word is 5 letters.

- Each letter is 1 byte.

So, per book:

400 pages.

Each page has 50 lines.

Each line has 10 words.

Each word has 5 letters.

So per page:

50 lines →50*10 words →500 words.

Each word:5 letters →500*5=2500 letters.

Each letter:1 byte →2500 bytes.

So per page:2500 bytes.

Each book:400 pages →400 *2500 =1,000,000 bytes.

Each book is 1,000,000 bytes.

3e6 books →3e6 *1e6 =3e12 bytes.

So 3e12 bytes.

Wait, but 3e12 bytes is 3e12 /1e18 =3e-6 exabytes, which is 0.000003 exabytes.

But none of the options match this except perhaps none.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the bytes per word.

Wait, each word has 5 letters →5 letters per word.

Wait, no, the calculation is correct. So 5 letters per word. So each word is 5 letters.

So per word, 5 letters →5 bytes per word.

So per line: 10 words →10 *5=50 bytes.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, per line: 10 words →each word is 5 letters →10 words *5 letters =50 letters.

Each letter is 1 byte →50 letters →50 bytes per line.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, each word is 5 letters, so 10 words would be 50 letters.

But each letter is 1 byte, so 50 letters →50 bytes per line.

Yes, correct.

So per line:50 bytes.

Each page has 50 lines →50 *50=2500 bytes per page.

Each book has 400 pages →400 *2500=1,000,000 bytes per book.

3e6 books →3e6 *1e6 =3e12 bytes.

Yes, correct.

So 3e12 bytes is correct.

But now, the options are:

- D: Exabyte (1e18 bytes)

- H: Gigabyte (1e9 bytes)

So 3e12 is 3e12 bytes, which is 3e-6 of an Exabyte (since 1e18 is 1e9 *1e9, so 1e18 is (1e9)^2, which is (1e6 *1e3)^2, which is 1e12 *1e6, so 1e12 is 1e18 /1e6. So 3e12 is 3e12 /1e18 =3e-6 exabytes.)

But the options don't have 3e-6 exabytes, but they have D: Exabyte, which is 1e18.

So, the best fit is D: Exabyte, because 3e12 is 3e-6 of an Exabyte, which is a very small fraction, but that's the only option provided.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the storage in exabytes.

Wait, 3e12 /1e18 =3e-6.

But perhaps the question is expecting the exabyte unit as the answer, even if it's a small fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pages.

Wait, let me compute again:

3e6 books.

Each book has 400 pages →3e6 *400 =1.2e9 pages.

Each page has 50 lines →1.2e9 *50 =6e10 lines.

Each line has 10 words →6e10 *10 =6e11 words.

Each word has 5 letters →6e11 *5 =3e12 letters.

Each letter is 1 byte →3e12 bytes.

Yes, correct.

So 3e12 bytes is correct.

Now, in exabytes: 3e12 /1e18 =3e-6.

But the options are:

A: KiloByte (1e3)

B: Petabyte (2^50 or ~1e15)

C: Yott (2^80 or ~1e24)

D: Exabyte (1e18)

E: Byte

So the question is, which unit is the best to measure the storage.

So 3e12 bytes is 3e-6 of an Exabyte.

But the options do not include 3e-6; the closest is D: Exabyte.

So perhaps the answer is D: Exabyte.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake, and the storage is 3e12 bytes, which is 3e-3 petabytes (since 1e15 is a petabyte), but that's not relevant.

Wait, but according to the options, the best fit is D: Exabyte.

So I think the answer is D: Exabyte.
</think>

The best unit to measure the storage is **Exabyte (1e18)** because 3e12 bytes is a fraction of an Exabyte, but it's the closest option provided.

ANSWER: D: Exabyte (1e18)
