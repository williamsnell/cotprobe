Question:

Explain the method of copulation in the earthworms.

Options:

A: Earthworms reproduce asexually by fission.
B: Earthworms engage in internal fertilization where one worm injects sperm directly into the ovaries of the other.
C: Each earthworm fertilizes its own eggs internally without the need for a mate.
D: Earthworms attract mates through airborne pheromones and mate on the surface without physical contact.
E: Earthworms reproduce by budding, where small worms grow out of the parent's body.
F: Earthworms exchange sperm by connecting their posterior ends and then separate to lay fertilized eggs.
G: Earthworms reproduce by external fertilization in water.
H: Earthworms lay eggs without any copulation.
I: Two earthworms unite ventral surface to ventral surface with opposite anterior ends. They discharge sperm into the other's seminal receptacles. After separation, a cocoon is secreted for egg and sperm deposition.
J: Two earthworms connect at their anterior ends and exchange sperm through their mouths before separating to lay eggs independently.

Okay, so I have this question about the method of copulation in earthworms. Hmm, copulation is when two organisms mate, right? I remember that in some insects, like flies, they use a process called copulation. But earthworms are different. Let me think.

Wait, earthworms are arachnids, right? They live in water. I remember they have a tentacle called a tentacle, which they use for communication. So they use this tentacle to direct sperm and eggs to their mate. Oh, right! They don't actually fertilize in the same way. Instead, they have a method where the tentacle helps them connect and then release sperm and eggs.

So the options are A to J. Let me go through them. Option E says they reproduce by budding, growing from the parent's body. But I don't think they do that. They don't have a parent to glue together; instead, their tentacle is used for communication. So E is probably wrong.

Option A says they reproduce asexually by fission. No, fission is for yeast, and earthworms probably reproduce by both asexually and sexually. They can have multiple offspring.

Option B says internal fertilization, like one injects sperm into the other's egg. I think that's not how it works. The earthworms don't do that. They don't have a fertilized egg structure. They don't use this method.

Option C says each fertilizes its own egg without needing a mate. That doesn't make sense either. They don't need another worm to fertilize their own. They use the tentacle to direct communication.

Option D: They attract mates via pheromones and mate on the surface without contact. I think earthworms do use pheromones, but I'm not sure. The method here is called copulation, so maybe they exchange sperm through pheromone signals. But I'm not certain if they do it without physical contact. Alternatively, the option says they connect via posterior ends and separate, which sounds like another method, so maybe D is incorrect.

Option F: Exchange sperm by connecting posterior ends. I'm not sure about this. From what I remember, they use the tentacle to direct sperm, not connect the ends. So maybe F is incorrect.

Option G: Reproduce externally in water. I don't think so. I think they use internal methods.

Option H: Reproduce without copulation. No, that's the opposite. Earthworms do copulate.

Option I: Two earthworms unite at the ventral surface with opposite ends. They release sperm into other's seminal. Then separate and secret. That sounds familiar. I think that's the method. So I is correct.

Option J: Connect at the anterior ends, exchange sperm through mouths, then separate. No, because earthworms don't use this. Their method is different.

So putting it together, the correct answer is I. They unite at the ventral surface with opposite ends, release sperm, then separate to lay eggs.

Wait, but I thought D and I are both options. Let me double-check. I remember that earthworms use pheromones to attract partners. So perhaps they use pheromones (like in D), but the option says they use another method. Alternatively, option I describes a method they use. So the question is about the method of copulation. So the answer should be I, as the method. So the correct choice is I.

The correct method of copulation in earthworms involves two earthworms connecting at their ventral surfaces with opposite anterior ends. They release sperm into the other's seminal receptacles, then separate and deposit a cocoon containing sperm and eggs. This process is described in option I. 

Answer: I
