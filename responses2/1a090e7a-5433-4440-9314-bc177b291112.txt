Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the number of photons in a light pulse. Let me see what it's asking. The question says: calculate the number of photons in a 2.00 mJ light pulse at (a) 1.06 micrometers. The options are A to J, each with a different number in scientific notation. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength. Oh right, the formula is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. So first, I need to calculate the energy per photon, then find out how many photons make up the given energy of 2.00 mJ.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I get the units right. The wavelength is given in micrometers, which is 1e-6 meters. And Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. Oh, and the energy is 2.00 mJ, which is 2.00e-3 J.

So the plan is: calculate each photon's energy, then divide the total energy by that to get the number of photons.

Let me compute that. So E per photon = hc / λ.

Plugging in the numbers: h is 6.626e-34, c is 3e8, λ is 1.06e-6 meters.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Denominator is 1.06e-6 m. So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.06e-6.

Let me compute that division. 1.9878e-25 divided by 1.06e-6. Let me compute the exponents first: 1e-25 / 1e-6 = 1e-19.

So 1.9878 / 1.06 ≈ 1.879. So the energy per photon is approximately 1.879e-19 J.

Then, the total number of photons is total energy divided by energy per photon. So 2.00e-3 J / 1.879e-19 J/photon.

Let's compute that. 2e-3 / 1.879e-19 = (2 / 1.879) * 1e16.

2 ÷ 1.879 is approximately 1.063. So 1.063e16 photons.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.80e16, which is close but not exactly. Option B is 1.07e16, which is about 1.063e16. So that's a match. Hmm, but wait, the options might have some rounding.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

E per photon: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = (6.626 *3) = 19.878e-26 → 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1.06e-6 m → 1.9878e-25 / 1.06e-6 → let me compute the exponent: 1e-25 / 1e-6 = 1e-19. So 1.9878 / 1.06 = let's compute that.

1.06 times 1.878 is about 1.06 * 1.8 = 1.908. 1.06 * 0.07 is 0.0742. So 1.878 would give 1.06 *1.878 ≈1.987... So 1.9878/1.06= approx 1.879. So E per photon is 1.879e-19 J.

Total photons N = 2e-3 / 1.879e-19 = (2/1.879) *1e16.

2 ÷ 1.879 is equal to ?

Let me compute 1.879 * 1.063 = 1.879*1=1.879, 1.879*0.06=0.11274, 1.879*0.003=0.005637. Sum: 1.879 +0.11274=1.99174 +0.005637≈2.0. So 1.063 *1.879 ≈2 → 2/1.879 ≈1.063. So N≈1.063e16.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.07e16, which is 1.07 *1e16. So that's very close to 1.063e16. But wait, perhaps the question uses more precise numbers. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute using more exact numbers.

h =6.62607015e-34 J·s. c=299792458 m/s. λ=1.06e-6 m.

E = (6.62607015e-34 J·s) * (2.99792458e8 m/s) / (1.06e-6 m).

First compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 *2.99792458e8 = (6.62607015 * 2.99792458) * 1e-34+8. 6.626 * approx 3 is 19.878, but exact calculation: 6.62607015 *2.99792458 ≈ approx 19.8647.

So 19.8647e-26 (since 1e-34+8 →1e-26). So E is 19.8647e-26 /1.06e-6.

Divide 19.8647e-26 by 1.06e-6 → which is (19.8647/1.06) *1e-20.

19.8647 /1.06 → 19.8647 ÷ 1.06.

Let me compute 1.06 *18=19.08. So 18.74? Let's see: 1.06 *18.74 → 1.06 *18=19.08; 1.06 *0.74=0.7844. So 19.08+0.7844=19.8644. Oh, that's almost exactly what we have.

So 19.8647 ÷1.06 is approximately 18.74. Therefore, E per photon is approx 18.74e-20 J, which is 1.874e-19 J.

Now, the total energy is 2.00 mJ =2.00e-3 J.

Number of photons N = 2.00e-3 J / 1.874e-19 J/photon.

Which is (2.00 /1.874) *1e16.

2.00 /1.874 ≈ 1.068. So N ≈1.068e16.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.07e16, which is very close. But let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 1.80e16

B: 1.07e16

C:1.20e16

D:2.50e16

E:1.50e16

F: 0.95e16

G:0.89e16

H:2.15e16

I:3.00e16

J:0.75e16

So the correct answer would be approximately 1.07e16, which is option B. But wait, why am I getting 1.068e16? That's about 1.07e16. So option B.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recast the calculation. Did I make a mistake in the unit conversions? Let me double-check.

Wait, 2.00 mJ is 2.00e-3 J. E per photon is (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.06e-6) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.06e-6) → 1.9878e-25 / 1.06e-6 = 1.9878e-19 J per photon.

So N = 2e-3 / 1.876e-19 = 2e-3 / 1.876e-19 ≈ 1.067e16. So 1.07e16.

Which is option B. So the correct answer should be B. But wait, I'm getting 1.067, which is approximately 1.07. Option B is 1.07e16, so that's correct.

To calculate the number of photons in a 2.00 mJ light pulse at a wavelength of 1.06 μm, we use the formula for the energy of a photon:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 1.06 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy per photon
\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.06 \times 10^{-6}}
\]

First, compute the numerator:
\[
6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3.00 \times 10^8 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}
\]

Next, divide by the wavelength:
\[
E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.06 \times 10^{-6}} = 1.879 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/photon}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of photons
The total energy of the pulse is \( 2.00 \, \text{mJ} = 2.00 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{J} \). The number of photons is given by:
\[
N = \frac{\text{Total Energy}}{\text{Energy per Photon}} = \frac{2.00 \times 10^{-3}}{1.879 \times 10^{-19}}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
N = \frac{2.00}{1.879} \times 10^{16} \approx 1.068 \times 10^{16}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated value of \( N \) is approximately \( 1.068 \times 10^{16} \), which is closest to option **B: \( 1.07 \times 10^{16} \)**.
