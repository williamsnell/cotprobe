Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Sojourn family going on a vacation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, they started with $2000. Then they spend $150 each day, and I need to find an expression that represents how much money they have after x days.

Hmm, let's break it down. They begin with 2000 dollars. Every day, they spend 150. So after one day, they'd have 2000 minus 150. After two days, it's 2000 minus 150 times 2. Oh wait, I see a pattern here. Each day, their balance decreases by 150.

So the general formula would be the initial amount minus the amount spent each day multiplied by the number of days. So it's 2000 minus 150x. But wait, let me think again to make sure I'm not getting confused.

Another way to look at it is that each day, the balance decreases by 150. So after x days, they've spent 150 multiplied by x, and subtract that from their initial amount. 

Let me check the options. Option D is 2000x minus 150, which doesn't make sense because that would mean they're adding 150 each day, but they're spending it. So that's incorrect. Option A is 1850x. Hmm, 1850 seems like 2000 minus 150... No, because 2000-150 is 1850. That would be the starting amount minus the daily spending if they were saving, but they're spending, so that's not right. Option B is 2000 divided by 150x. That doesn't make sense either because division by 150 would give a fraction, and multiplying by x would make it more.

Option C is 2000x minus 150x. Oh wait, that's combining the terms. 2000x -150x would be (2000-150)x, which is 1850x. But that's not how the problem is set up. They start with 2000, and each day subtract 150. So it's 2000 - (150x), which is 2000-150x. So option D is 2000x - 150, which isn't the same. So maybe C isn't correct either.

Option E is 2000 plus 150 over x. That seems like if they were adding money, but they're spending, so that's not right.

Option F is 150x. That's just the amount spent, not the remaining money.

Option G is 2000 plus 150x. Again, that's incorrect because they started with 2000, not adding.

Option H is 2000 minus 150 over x. Hmm, that would imply they are adding 150 each day. But they are spending, so no.

Option I is 2000 minus 150x. Yes, that's exactly what I thought earlier. Subtracting 150 times x from 2000.

Option J is 150x minus 2000. That would give a negative number after x days, which doesn't make sense because they shouldn't have negative money. So that's wrong.

So looking back, the correct expression is 2000 minus 150x. So the correct option is I.

The correct expression is 2000 - 150x. 

Answer: I: 2000 −150x
