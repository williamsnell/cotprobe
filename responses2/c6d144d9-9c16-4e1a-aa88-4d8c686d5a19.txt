Okay, so I have this bond question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about calculating the effective yield of a 6 3/4% bond with a face value of $1,000, bought at 88 3/4. They want the answer to the nearest 1/10 percent, so two decimal places probably. The options are given as letters from A to J, each with a percentage value.

First, I remember that effective yield, also known as current yield, is the annual interest divided by the current market price of the bond. But wait, sometimes effective yield can also be the yield to maturity if considering the time value of money, but I'm not sure if that's needed here. The question says "effective yield," which I think refers to the current yield because it's the return you get from the interest payment relative to the price paid.

So, the bond pays 6 3/4% per annum. Let me convert that into a decimal for easier calculations. 6 3/4 is 6.75%. So the annual interest is 6.75% of $1,000, which is $67.50.

The bond is bought at 88 3/4. Let me convert that to dollars. 88 3/4 is 88.75. So the purchase price is $88.75.

Now, the current yield is calculated by dividing the annual interest by the purchase price. So current yield = $67.50 / $88.75.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 67.50 divided by 88.75. Let me do the division. 67.50 ÷ 88.75. Let's think in terms of fractions. 67.5 is 67.5, and 88.75 is 88.75.

Alternatively, 67.5 / 88.75 = ?

I can simplify this by multiplying numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 6750 / 8875.

Hmm, let's see. Let me try to compute that.

Perhaps I can divide both numerator and denominator by 25. 6750 ÷25=270, 8875 ÷25=355. So now it's 270/355. Let me see if that can be simplified further. Both are divisible by 5? 270 ÷5=54, 355 ÷5=71. So 54/71.

Calculating 54 divided by 71. Let me do that division. 54 ÷71. 71 goes into 54 zero times. Add a decimal: 540 divided by 71. 71*7=497. 540-497=43. Bring down a zero: 430. 71*6=426. 430-426=4. Bring down a zero: 40. 71 goes into 40 zero times. Bring down another zero: 400. 71*5=355. 400-355=45. Bring down a zero: 450. 71*6=426. 450-426=24. Bring down a zero: 240. 71*3=213. 240-213=27. Bring down a zero: 270. 71*3=213. 270-213=57. Bring down a zero: 570. 71*8=568. 570-568=2. Bring down a zero: 20. 71 goes into 20 zero times. Bring down another zero: 200. 71*2=142. 200-142=58. Bring down a zero: 580. 71*8=568. 580-568=12. Bring down a zero: 120. 71*1=71. 120-71=49. Bring down a zero: 490. 71*6=426. 490-426=64. Bring down a zero: 640. 71*9=639. 640-639=1. Hmm, this is getting long. But the approximate value is about 0.7549 or something.

Wait, let me check that again. 54/71. 71*0.75 is 53.25. So 0.75 would give 53.25. Our numerator is 54, so the decimal is 0.7549 approximately.

So, the current yield is approximately 75.49%. But wait, that can't be right because 67.50 / 88.75 is 0.7549, which is 75.49%. But that's higher than the coupon rate. Wait, no, the coupon rate is 6.75%, so the current yield is 75.49%, which is higher than the coupon rate. But wait, I must have made a mistake because 67.50 is less than 88.75, so the yield should be less than the coupon rate. Oh wait, no: because the interest is fixed, but the price is lower than the face value. So when you buy at a discount, the yield is higher than the coupon rate. So 75.49% seems correct.

Wait, but that's not possible because 67.50 / 88.75 is approximately 75.49%. That's actually a high yield, which seems too high, but maybe. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, 88.75 is the purchase price. So 88.75 is the amount you paid for the bond. The interest is $67.50 per year, so your return on investment is 67.50 / 88.75 = 0.7549, which is 75.49%. That seems correct given that you paid less than the face value. So the current yield is about 75.49%, but the question is about the effective yield. Wait, no, effective yield is usually the current yield, because it's the return on the investment based on the purchase price. Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should think about effective yield as the yield to maturity. That would be a different calculation, but I'm not entirely sure. The question says "effective yield," which can sometimes refer to the yield to maturity, but sometimes it's called the effective rate or current yield.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. Let me think again. The current yield is annual interest divided by purchase price. So if you buy a bond at a discount, current yield is higher than the coupon rate. So in this case, 6.75% coupon, buy at 88.75% of face, so 67.50 / 88.75 = 0.7549 or 75.49%. But looking at the options, the closest is 7.6% (A), 7.2% (B), 8.2% (C), etc. Wait, but 75% is way higher than any given option. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate 67.5 / 88.75. Let's compute it more accurately. Let's do 67.5 ÷ 88.75.

Divide both numerator and denominator by 25: 67.5 ÷25 = 2.7, 88.75 ÷25=3.55.

So 2.7 / 3.55 = ?

Hmm, 3.55 × 0.75 = 2.6625. 2.7 is a bit higher than 2.6625, so 0.75 + (0.0375/3.55) → Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate 2.7 divided by 3.55.

Alternatively, 3.55 × 0.75 = 2.6625. 2.7 is 0.0375 higher than 2.6625. So 0.0375/3.55 ≈ 0.01058. So total is approximately 0.75 + 0.01058 = 0.76058, which is 76.058%. So the current yield is approximately 76.06%. That's about 76.06% per annum. But that's way higher than any of the options provided. But the options are all in 0.1% increments, ranging from 6.2% to 9.6%. So 76% is way beyond. That can't be right.

Wait, did I misinterpret the question? The face value is $1,000. So the bond pays interest of 6.75% per annum, which is $67.50. If bought at 88.75, which is 88.75% of face value, then the current yield is 67.50 / 88.75 = 0.7549, which is 75.49%. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, is there a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the numbers. 67.5 divided by 88.75.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 67.5 / 88.75.

Let me write it as a division problem.

88.75 goes into 67.5 how many times.

Wait, 88.75 is larger than 67.5, so it goes 0.7549 times.

So, 75.49% is correct. But none of the options match that. So perhaps the question is asking for the effective yield as a yield to maturity (YTM) instead of current yield. Let's try that approach.

To compute YTM, I need to find the internal rate of return that equates the present value of the bond's cash flows to its purchase price. The bond's cash flows are the annual coupon payment of $67.50 and the face value of $1,000 paid at maturity. But wait, the time to maturity isn't given, so I can't compute it directly. Hmm, that complicates things. Without knowing the time to maturity, it's impossible to calculate YTM accurately. Therefore, perhaps the question is using the current yield instead of the effective yield. But that would mean the answer is 75.49%, which isn't an option.

Wait, but the options are all much lower, so perhaps I'm misapplying the concepts. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the effective yield as the annual yield based on the face value, but that's the same as the current yield when the bond is bought at face value. So if the bond is bought at a discount, the current yield is higher than the coupon rate.

Wait, but according to the options, the highest is 9.6%, which is way higher than 75%. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the effective interest rate.

Wait a second! Oh! Wait, perhaps I confused effective yield with the yield to maturity, but perhaps the question is actually asking for the effective interest rate in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the actual yield, but that doesn't make much sense. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting the bond's purchase price. Let me double-check that. The bond is bought at 88 3/4, which is 88.75. Yes, that's correct. So 88.75% of face value (which is $1000) is 88.75 * 1000 = $8875. But when you buy it, the price is $8875 if the face is $1,000. Wait, that can't be right because 88 3/4 is 88.75, meaning 88.75% of $1000 is $887.5. Wait, no, because 1000 * 0.8875 is $887.5. Wait, that's a confusion. Let me clarify: the purchase price is 88 3/4% of the face value. So 88.75% of $1000 is $887.5. Wait, that can't be. Because 88.75% of $1000 is $887.50. But that seems like a very expensive bond. Let me verify. So the bond is bought at 88.75% of $1000, so $887.50. So the purchase price is $887.50, not $88.75. Oh, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier.

So the price is 88.75% of $1000, so $887.50. Wait, but the face value is $1000. So the purchase price is higher than the face value. So the bond is bought at a premium.

Wait, that changes everything. Because if you buy a bond at a premium, then the current yield is less than the coupon rate. Because the purchase price is higher than face value, so the return is lower than the coupon. So the current yield is 6.75% / (88.75% of $1000) which is 6.75% / 88.75% of 1000.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Current yield = ( Annual interest ) / ( Purchase price )

So Annual interest is 6.75% of $1000 = $67.50.

Purchase price is 88.75% of $1000 = $887.50.

So current yield = 67.50 / 887.50 = ?

Let me compute that.

67.50 ÷ 887.50.

Hmm, 887.50 is 887.5. Let's divide 67.5 by 887.5.

Well, 67.5 / 887.5 = (67.5 ÷ 887.5) = ?

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate decimals: 135 / 1775.

Approximately, 135 ÷ 1775. Let me compute that.

1775 × 0.075 is 133.125. 135 is 1.875 more than 133.125. So 0.075 + (1.875 / 1775) = 0.075 + 0.001054 ≈ 0.076054. So approximately 7.6054%.

Which rounds to about 7.605%. So to the nearest 1/10 percent, that's 7.6% (option A). So the correct answer would be A: 7.6%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the purchase price was 88.75, but that was incorrect. It's 88.75% of $1000, which is $887.50. So the purchase price is higher than the face value, so the yield is lower than the coupon rate. So 6.75% / 887.50% of $1000 gives 7.6%, which is option A.
</think>

The question asks for the effective yield of a 6 3/4% bond with a face value of $1,000, purchased at 88 3/4, to the nearest 1/10%. 

### Key Calculations:
1. **Coupon Rate**: 6 3/4% corresponds to an annual interest payment of 6.75% of $1,000, which is $67.50.
2. **Purchase Price**: 88 3/4% of $1,000 is $887.50.
3. **Current Yield**: This is calculated as the annual interest divided by the purchase price:
   \[
   \text{Current Yield} = \frac{67.50}{887.50} \approx 0.07605 \, \text{or} \, 7.605\%
   \]
   Rounded to the nearest 1/10% (i.e., 0.1%), this is 7.6%.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (7.6%)**: Matches the calculated current yield of approximately 7.605%.
- The other options (7.2%, 8.2%, 8.6%, 8.8%, 9.2%, 9.6%, and 6.6%) are either too low or too high, but none are closer to the calculated yield.
