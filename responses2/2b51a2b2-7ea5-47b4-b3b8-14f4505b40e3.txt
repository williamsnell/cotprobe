Question:

In 2006, an investor purchased a 100-acre tract located in a rural county. Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that "in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. " In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)

Options:

A: equitable servitude.
B: easement for public use.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically regarding easements and other legal terms. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the scenario: An investor bought a 100-acre tract, 90 of which are residential one-acre lots, and the remaining 10 are proposed for a public school. In the sales brochure, the investor claims that the 10 acres would be close enough to the school district's school, and that the county wouldn't need to spend taxes for school construction there. 

Then, in 2009, the subdivision plan was recorded, and the county school board decided to build a new school there. The question is about what the investor's proposed designation of the 10 acres for the school would best be described as.

The options are: equitable servitude, easement for public use, invalid legal agreement, implied easement, etc. 

Hmm. So, what's the legal term for designating land for a public purpose? Easements are rights granted by landowners to others. An easement can be for private use or public use. Since the 10 acres are for a public purpose (the new school), I think it's an easement for public use.

Wait, but in property law, an easement is typically granted by the owner. So, if the owner has the right to use the land for a school, that's an easement. Now, for a public school, the easement is probably for public use. Let me think about the characteristics of an easement for public use. It's generally for a specific purpose, such as a school, and it's usually created with the owner's consent. 

The question is about the designation of the 10 acres. The idea is that the subdivision plan recorded the 10 acres for the school. So, the original plan was probably recorded, but the actual use by the school board is a different matter. Wait, noâ€”the subdivision plan was recorded, but the actual use by the school board is a new development. 

Wait, the question is about the designation. The investor is proposing that the 10 acres are now designated for the school. So, the original plan recorded the 10 acres for the school, but perhaps the plan's use was not commercial. Or maybe it was intended for a school, but the use was not commercial, leading to the grant of an easement.

Wait, but in the sales brochure, he says that the 10 acres would be close to the school district's school and that the tax money wouldn't be needed. So, he's claiming that the 10 acres are now available for the school without needing any additional funds.

But in property law, when you have a subdivision plan recorded, it's an arrangement that you're supposed to follow unless you're against it. So, if the subdivision plan recorded an easement for the 10 acres, perhaps the court would allow that?

Wait, but the question is about the designation in the subdivision plan. The subdivision plan was recorded, and when the school board voted to build, they used the 10 acres. So, the question is about what the investor's designation is.

Wait, but the initial plan recorded the 10 acres for the school. So, in the subdivision plan, the 10 acres are designated for a school. So, the plan is recorded, but the use is new. 

But in property law, when a subdivision plan records an easement, it's for the benefit of the owner. So, when the subdivision plan was recorded, the 10 acres would be granted to the owner for the school. But perhaps the developer recorded the plan but didn't officially grant the easement. Alternatively, perhaps the plan was recorded, and the owner later granted an easement for the public school.

Wait, but the question says the subdivision plan was recorded, and the county school board voted to build on the 10 acres. So, perhaps the subdivision plan was recorded, and the actual use is the new school. But the question is about the designation in the plan.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "In 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract." So, the designation in the subdivision plan would be for the new school. So, the plan was recorded, and the new use is the school. 

But the question is about what the investor's proposed designation would be. Wait, initially, he proposed to designate the 10 acres for a school. So, the plan recorded it, but the use was the school. So, perhaps the plan's use was for an easement.

Wait, perhaps the plan was recorded, and the owner intended to grant an easement for the school. But then why was the plan recorded? Because the plan was recorded, and the owner later used it as an easement. So, maybe the subdivision plan was recorded, but then the use was the school. That would mean the plan was recorded, but the use was for an easement.

Wait, but the question is about the designation in the subdivision plan. The plan was recorded, and the new school was built. So, the design would be that the 10 acres are now an easement for the school. 

Wait, but how does the designation in the plan work? The plan was recorded, which would create an easement. But the person's proposed designation was to use it for the school. So, perhaps the plan was recorded, and the owner later used it as an easement for the school, which would make it invalid if the use was for an easement. But the person is proposing to designate it as for the school.

Wait, but the question is about the designation in the subdivision plan as it is recorded. So, the plan was recorded, and the use was for a school. So, the plan would be a valid easement for public use because it was recorded and the use is for a public purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan was recorded, but the use was for an easement, and the landowner later used it for a school. But in that case, the plan would not be valid. But the question is about the designation in the plan as recorded. So, the plan was recorded, and the use is for a school, so it's an easement for public use.

Wait, but another angle: In some cases, a subdivision plan records the land, but the use of the land is for the owner's own use, not for the school. So, the plan would be a valid easement for the owner, but the use is commercial, so perhaps it's an easement for private use. But the person in the case claims that the school district won't need tax money, implying that it's for public use.

So, in the case of the subdivision plan being recorded, and then the owner uses it for a public purpose, the plan would be valid as an easement for public use. So, the answer would be B: easement for public use.

Alternatively, if the subdivision plan was recorded, and the use of the land is for the owner's personal use, not for a public purpose, then the plan wouldn't be valid. But the question states that the county school district would not need tax money. That suggests the use is public, so the plan is for public use. So, the subdivision plan was recorded, and the use is for a public school, so the plan is an easement for public use.

Wait, but the options include "implied easement" as option D. An implied easement is usually when the owner is impliedly granting an easement without the landowner's consent. That's more like a right of way for a new road. So, for example, if the owner is impliedly granting an easement, it's not recorded. So, if the subdivision plan was recorded, and the use is for a public purpose, then the plan is valid as an easement for public use, not implied.

So, the answer would be B: easement for public use.

The question involves determining the nature of the designation of land for a public purpose in a subdivision plan recorded by the county recorder's office. The investor claims that the 10 acres are designated for a new public school, and the subdivision plan was recorded. The key is to identify the legal term that best describes this designation.

1. **Easement for Public Use**: An easement granted by landowners for public use is typically recorded and intended for commercial or private purposes. However, if the landowner later uses the land for a public purpose, the plan is still valid as an easement for public use. The county school district's claim that no tax money is needed for school construction supports this interpretation, as the use is public.

2. **Implied Easement**: This term implies that the owner is implicitly granting an easement to others without explicit consent. This is different from recording a valid easement for public use, where the owner's intent is clear.

3. **Other Options**: Other options like "equitable servitude," "real estate lien," or "unenforceable restriction" are not applicable here. The scenario does not involve equitable servitude or a real estate lien, and the subdivision plan was recorded, indicating a valid easement.

Given that the subdivision plan was recorded and the use is for a public school, the designation is best described as an easement for public use.
