Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about passive activity losses, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about which statement correctly describes how suspended passive activity losses work, especially when it comes to carryback and carryforward periods. I remember from my finance classes that when you have passive income, like rental properties or stocks, you can have losses, but these losses can't be used for active income. They have to be carried forward.

So, the options are A to J. Let me go through each one.

Option A: "Suspended losses can only be utilized against active income, not portfolio income." Hmm, wait. I think that's not right. I remember that the distinction is between portfolio income and passive income. Portfolio income includes things like rental properties, stocks, etc., while active income is things like salary or dividends. But the carryforward and carryback periods are the same for both. Oh wait, but the option says only active income. Maybe this is incorrect because I thought they can be used against either, but the statement says only active, which I don't think is correct. So I might be wrong about this.

Option B: "Suspended losses must be carried forward five years and back two years." No, I think the periods are different. I recall that the carryback period is five years, and carryforward is two years. So this option is incorrect because it says five and two, but I think it's five and two. So B is wrong.

Option C: "A maximum of 75% of the suspended losses can be used each year when an election is made to forgo the carryback period." Wait, when you forgo carryback, the deduction is 75% of the losses. So this makes sense. So C might be correct. But I need to check the other options first.

Option D: "Suspended losses must be carried back three years and forward seven years." No, carryback is five, carryforward is two, so D is wrong.

Option E: "Suspended losses can be carried forward, but not back, until utilized." No, because you can carry forward even if you're not yet utilizing them. So E is incorrect.

Option F: "Suspended losses can be carried back three years, but not forward." That's incorrect because the carryforward is two years, not three. So F is wrong.

Option G: "$3,000 of suspended losses can be utilized each year against portfolio income." I thought the amount varies, but I don't remember exactly. Oh wait, the maximum per year when carryback is forgo is 75%, which would be 3k * 0.75=2.25k. But option G says $3k, which depends on the situation. So maybe that's not the correct statement. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is incorrect because when you forgo carryback, the deduction is 75%, but you can't use the full amount each year. So this might not be accurate.

Option H: "A maximum of 50% of the suspended losses can be used each year when an election is made to forgo the carryback period." Wait, no. When you forgo carryback, the deduction is 75% of the losses. So each year, you can take up to 75% of the suspended losses, not 50%. So H is incorrect.

Option I: "Only 25% of the suspended losses can be used each year without any carryback or carryforward period." No, I don't think so. Because when you don't carryback, the deduction is full amount, so 100% of the suspended losses can be used each year. So I is wrong.

Option J: "Suspended losses can be carried back and forward indefinitely until utilized." No, that's not right. You can't carry forward indefinitely. They have to be terminated before starting. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so going back to option C: when you make an election to forgo the carryback period, the deduction is 75% of the losses. So, can you carry forward the full amount? Or does it depend on the election?

Wait, no. The 75% is the amount of the deduction that can be used each year. But the full amount of the suspended loss is carried forward. So for option C, it's about how much can be used each year when you forgo carryback. So when you forgo, the deduction is 75%, but the full amount is carried forward. So each year, you can use the 75% deduction, but the full amount is still available.

So option C says that when you make the election, the suspended losses can be used up to 75% each year. So that's correct.

So let's check all options again.

Option A: Incorrect, because you can use both active and portfolio income.

Option B: Incorrect, carryback is five, carryforward is two.

Option C: Correct.

Option D: Incorrect, carryback is five, not three.

Option E: Incorrect, can carry forward regardless.

Option F: Incorrect, carryforward is two, not three.

Option G: Incorrect, because when forgo carryback, 75% is the deduction per year, not 3k.

Option H: Incorrect, 75% not 50%.

Option I: Incorrect, you can't get 25% of the loss each year.

Option J: Incorrect, can't carry forward indefinitely.

So the correct answer is option C.
