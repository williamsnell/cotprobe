Okay, so I've got this problem about a bookstore trying to figure out the optimal price for their anthropology textbooks to maximize profit. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that the bookstore can buy 200 books from the publisher each time for $3 each. They think they can sell these at $15 each, but for every 50-cent reduction in price, they'll sell 10 more books. I need to find the price that maximizes their profit.

Hmm, first, let me figure out the variables involved. The current selling price is $15, and the cost is $3 per book. So, the profit per book is selling price minus cost. But wait, the problem says they can reduce the price, so that affects both the selling price and the number of books sold. 

Wait, let me read again. The store believes it can sell these books at $15 each, but will be able to sell 10 more for every 50-cent reduction in the price. So, the price reduction affects the quantity sold. 

Let me model this. Let's denote x as the number of 50-cent reductions. So, each reduction is 0.5 dollars. So, if x is 0, the price is $15 and they sell 200 books. If x is 1, the price is $14.5, and they sell 210 books. Wait, because for every 50-cent reduction, they sell 10 more. So, each 0.5 decrease adds 10 books. So, the number of books sold is 200 + 10x.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. If x is the number of 0.5 dollar reductions, then each 0.5 reduction adds 10 books. So, x=0: 200 books. x=1: 200 +10=210. x=2: 220, and so on. So the number of books is 200 +10x.

The selling price, then, would be 15 minus 0.5x dollars. Because each x is a 0.5 reduction. So, price = 15 - 0.5x.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me be careful with the variables. The price reduces by 0.5 per x, so for x=0, price=15. For x=1, 15 -0.5(1)=14.5. For x=2, 14, etc. So, the price is 15 - 0.5x.

Now, the cost per book is $3, so the profit per book is (price - cost) = (15 -0.5x) - 3 = 12 -0.5x.

But wait, the total profit is the profit per book multiplied by the number of books sold. So, total profit P = (12 -0.5x) * (200 +10x).

So, P = (12 -0.5x)(200 +10x). Let me expand this equation.

Multiply out: 12*(200 +10x) -0.5x*(200 +10x).

12*200 = 2400, 12*10x =120x.

-0.5x*200 = -100x, and -0.5x*10x = -5x².

So, P = 2400 +120x -100x -5x² = 2400 +20x -5x².

So, P = -5x² +20x +2400.

Hmm, this is a quadratic equation. Since the coefficient of x² is negative (-5), the parabola opens downward, so the maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex of a parabola given by ax² +bx +c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = -5, b=20.

So x = -20/(2*(-5)) = -20/(-10) = 2.

So x = 2. That means there are 2 0.5 dollar reductions.

So the price is 15 - 0.5*2 = 15 -1 = $14.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A to J: 11,7,6,9,15,12,14,13,10,8.

Wait, 14 is option G. But wait, wait a second. Let me recheck: the problem says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the correct answer is G, which is 14. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, another way: perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, the profit per book is (price - cost). So when x is the number of reductions, the price is 15 -0.5x. So the profit per book is (15 -0.5x) -3 = 12 -0.5x. Correct.

Number sold is 200 +10x. So profit is (12 -0.5x)(200 +10x)=?

Let me recalculate that.

(12 -0.5x)(200 +10x) = 12*200 +12*10x -0.5x*200 -0.5x*10x

12*200 = 2400
12*10x =120x
-0.5x*200 = -100x
-0.5x*10x = -5x²
So sum: 2400 +120x -100x -5x² = 2400 +20x -5x². Correct.

So P = -5x² +20x +2400.

Vertex at x= -b/(2a) = -20/(2*(-5)) = 2. So x=2.

So price is 15 -0.5*2 =15-1=14. So the price is $14, which is option G.

Wait, but wait, when I look at the options, option G is 14. So the answer should be G. But wait, I'm a bit confused because option G is 14, which is what I got. But in the options, E is 15, D is 9, etc. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup?

Wait, maybe the price is 15 - 0.5x, but perhaps x is the number of times the price is reduced, so each 0.5 is a unit. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the price as a function of x where x is the number of 0.5 reductions. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps x is the number of 0.5 reductions. So for x=0, price is 15, sold 200 books.

For each 0.5 reduction (x increases by 1), the price drops by 0.5, and sold books increase by 10.

So, number sold is 200 +10x.

Price is 15 -0.5x.

Profit per book is (15 -0.5x) -3 =12 -0.5x.

Total profit is profit per book times number sold: (12 -0.5x)(200 +10x).

Which is same as before. So calculations are correct.

Thus, the maximum occurs at x=2, price=14. So the correct answer is G: $14.

To determine the price that maximizes profit, let's model the situation step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of 50-cent reductions in the selling price.
   - The selling price per book becomes \( 15 - 0.5x \) dollars.
   - The number of books sold is \( 200 + 10x \).

2. **Calculate Profit Per Book:**
   - Profit per book = Selling price - Cost price
   - Profit per book = \( (15 - 0.5x) - 3 = 12 - 0.5x \).

3. **Total Profit Function:**
   - Total profit \( P \) is the product of profit per book and number of books sold:
   \[
   P = (12 - 0.5x)(200 + 10x)
   \]
   Expanding the equation:
   \[
   P = 2400 + 120x - 100x - 5x^2 = 2400 + 20x - 5x^2
   \]
   Thus, \( P = -5x^2 + 20x + 2400 \).

4. **Find the Vertex for Maximum Profit:**
   - The profit function is a quadratic equation opening downward (since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative), so the maximum occurs at the vertex.
   - The vertex is at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \), where \( a = -5 \) and \( b = 20 \):
   \[
   x = -\frac{20}{2(-5)} = 2
   \]

5. **Determine the Optimal Selling Price:**
   - Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the price equation:
   \[
   \text{Price} = 15 - 0.5(2) = 15 - 1 = 14
   \]

6. **Verify Against Options:**
   - The calculated price is $14, which corresponds to option G.

**Answer:** G
