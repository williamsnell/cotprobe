Okay, so I've got this finance problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the financing charge for a stove purchase. Hmm, let's see.

Alright, the problem says that a $25 stove can be bought with a $25 down payment and 12 monthly payments of $20. I need to find the financing charge. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the financing charge is the interest paid on the loan, right?

Wait, let me think. The total amount paid would be the down payment plus the monthly payments. So, the down is $25, and each of the 12 payments is $20. Let me calculate that: 12 * $20 is $240. Plus the $25 down makes it $265 in total.

But the original price is $250. So, the extra amount paid is the financing charge. Let me subtract the original price from the total payments. $265 minus $250 equals $15. So, the financing charge is $15? But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Sometimes, the way it's phrased can be tricky. The question says the stove is purchased under the installment plan for a $25 down and 12 payments of $20. So, the total installment cost is $25 + (12*$20) = $25 + $240 = $265. The original price is $250, so the extra $15 is the interest or the financing charge.

Wait, but some people calculate it as the interest based on the amount financed. The amount financed would be the price minus the down payment, which is $250 - $25 = $225. The total amount paid is $265, so the interest is $265 - $225 = $40. But wait, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between total interest and simple interest. Let me clarify. The total amount paid is $265. The amount financed is $225. So, the interest is 265 - 225 = $40. But that doesn't match the earlier $15. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me re-express this. The total installment is $25 down and 12 payments of $20 each. So, 12 * 20 is 240, plus 25 is 265. The original price is 250, so 265 minus 250 is 15. So, the financing charge is $15. So, option I is $15.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. The interest is the total paid minus the amount financed. The amount financed is 250 - 25 = 225. So, 265 total minus 225 is 40. So, why the discrepancy?

Ah, wait, perhaps the question is asking for the interest rate, not the total interest. Because if we're to calculate the interest rate, we might need to consider the time period and the actual interest calculation method, like simple interest.

Alternatively, perhaps the $20 is the total amount paid each month, which includes the principal and interest. But in that case, the total payment is 12 * 20 = 240, plus 25 = 265. So, the interest is 265 - 250 = 15.

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So the total interest is 15. But sometimes, people might compute the interest as the difference between the total payments and the price. So, in this case, the answer would be $15, which is option I.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to calculate interest is to consider the present value. But I think that's more complicated than needed here. The question is probably asking for the total interest, which is 15. So the answer should be I: $15.

The total amount paid under the installment plan is $250 (price) + $25 (down payment) = $265. The original price is $250, so the financing charge is the difference, which is $15.
