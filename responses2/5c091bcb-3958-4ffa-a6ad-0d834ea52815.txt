Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the amount of energy needed to heat water to its boiling point using a container. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The container has dimensions 2.5 m × 50 cm × 60 mm. Wait, I think I need to convert all those measurements to the same unit, probably meters or centimeters, because the other data is in those units. But let's see. Oh, wait, maybe it's easier to convert all to centimeters since 1 m is 100 cm, so 2.5 m would be 250 cm. 

So, the container's dimensions in cm are:
250 cm (length) × 50 cm (width) × 60 mm (height). Wait, 60 mm is 6 cm because 10 mm is 1 cm. So, 60 mm is 6 cm. So, the dimensions are 250 cm × 50 cm × 6 cm.

Now, the volume of the container would be length × width × height. Let's calculate that. 250 * 50 is 12,500, and then times 6 is 75,000 cm³. Wait, 75,000 cm³. Oh wait, 1 cm³ is 1 mL, right? So the volume is 75,000 mL, which is 75 liters. Wait, but wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, but 75,000 mL is 75 liters, because 1000 mL is 1 liter. So, the container holds 75 liters of water.

The water is at 32°F, and we need to heat it to 212°F. So, the temperature change is 212 - 32, which is 180°F. But wait, the specific heat capacity of water is usually given in terms of Celsius. I should convert this Fahrenheit change to Celsius. Oh, right, because 1°F is about 0.5556°C. So 180°F is 180 * (5/9) = 100°C. So the temperature change is 100°C.

The formula for the heat energy required is Q = m * c * ΔT. So I need the mass of the water, the specific heat capacity, and the change in temperature.

The mass of the water is the volume multiplied by the density. The density of water is about 1 kg/L, so 75 liters would be 75 kg.

The specific heat capacity of water in SI units is 4186 J/(kg·°C). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as 1 kcal/(kg·°C), I think. Wait, because 1 kcal is about 4184 J. So, 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is 4184 J. So, 1 J is about 0.000239 kcal. So, to convert J to kcal, you multiply by 0.000239 or divide by 4184.

Wait, wait, the formula is Q = m * c * ΔT. So, using c in J/(kg°C) or perhaps converting to kcal/(kg°C) to make the units match.

Wait, let me think. If I use c as 4186 J/(kg·°C), then:

Q = 75 kg * 4186 J/(kg·°C) * 100 °C = 75 * 4186 * 100 J.

Let me compute that. 75 * 4186 is... 75 *4000 is 300,000, 75 * 186 is 13,950. So sum is 313,950. Multiply by 100, so 31,395,000 J.

Now convert J to kcal. Since 1 kcal = 4184 J, so 31,395,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ ?

Let me compute 31,395,000 / 4184. Let me see: 4184 * x = 31,395,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 31,395,000 /4 = 7,848,750. 4184/4=1046.

So 7,848,750 / 1046. Let me approximate. 1046 * 7500 = let's see, 1000 *7500=7,500,000. 46 *7500=345,000. So 7,500,000 +345,000=7,845,000. So 7500 * 1046 =7,845,000. Our numerator is 7,848,750. So that's 7500 * 1046 = 7,845,000. The difference is 3,750. So 3,750 / 1046 ≈ 3.58. So total is approximately 7500 +3.58 = 7503.58 kcal.

Wait, but wait, let's compute 75 * 4186 * 100 = 75 *418600. 75 *418600 = (75 *400000) + (75*18600) → 30,000,000 + 1,402,500 = 31,402,500 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 31,395,000, which makes it a bit lower. So I'll proceed with that.

31,402,500 J = 31,402,500 /4184 ≈ let's compute.

4184 * 7500 = 31,380,000. I have 31,402,500, which is 22,500 more than 31,380,000. So 22,500 /4184 ≈ 5.386. So total is 7500 +5.386=7505.386 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 7500 kcal. The options are in the 7-8e3 range. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should compute the volume in m³ and then find the mass in kg. Let me try that.

Volume = 2.5 m * 0.5 m * 0.06 m (since 50 cm is 0.5 m, 60 mm is 0.06 m). So 2.5 * 0.5 = 1.25; 1.25 *0.06 =0.075 m³. 0.075 m³ is 75 liters. So mass is 75 kg. Same as before.

So, using Q = m c ΔT. c is 4186 J/(kg·°C). ΔT is 100°C.

So Q = 75 *4186 *100 J.

75 *4186 = 313,950. Multiply by 100 gives 31,395,000 J.

Convert to kcal: 31,395,000 /4184 ≈ let's compute.

4184 * 7500 = 31,380,000. So 31,395,000 is 15,000 more than 31,380,000.

15,000 /4184 ≈ 3.586.

So Q ≈7500 +3.586=7503.586 kcal. But looking at the options, the closest is option F (8.5e3) or option G (6.5e3). Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, the container's dimensions are 2.5 m ×50 cm ×60 mm. Let me reconvert all to centimeters. 2.5 m is 250 cm. 50 cm is 50 cm. 60 mm is 6 cm.

So 250 cm *50 cm *6 cm = 250*50=12,500; 12,500 *6=75,000 cm³. Which is 75 liters. So that's correct.

So mass is 75 kg, right. So 75 kg.

Wait, perhaps the specific heat capacity is given differently. Let me check if I used the right value.

Wait, I've used 4186 J/(kg·°C). But wait, sometimes in some textbooks, the specific heat capacity is approximated as 1 kcal/(kg·°C). So, perhaps that's where confusion arises. Let me see.

If I use c = 1 kcal/(kg·°C), then Q = 75 *1 *100 =7500 kcal. That would align with option G (6.5e3 is 6500, option G is 6.5e3, which is 6500, but wait, 7500 is not an option. So perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different unit for specific heat capacity. Wait, another possibility is that the specific heat capacity is 1 cal/(kg·°C) and 1 cal is about 4.184 J. So, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So, if I use c = 1 cal/(kg·°C), then Q in J is 75*1*100*4.184 = 75 *100 *4.184 = 75*418.4 = 31,380 J. Then, converting to kcal: 31380 J /4184 J/kcal ≈7.5 kcal. That would be 7.5e3, which matches option C (7.5 ×10^3 Kcal).

But wait, that would be if c is 1 cal/(kg·°C). But the standard specific heat capacity is 4.184 J/(kg·°C). So perhaps I made a mistake in using the wrong value.

Wait, that's a big issue. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the container's volume is 75 m³? No, that can't be. Wait, the container's dimensions are 2.5 m (length) ×50 cm (width) ×60 mm (height). Wait, 60 mm is 0.06 m, right? So 2.5 m × 0.5 m × 0.06 m = 2.5 * 0.5 =1.25; 1.25 *0.06=0.075 m³. 0.075 m³ is 75 liters, which is 75 kg. So that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps I should use the specific heat in J/(kg·°C), which is 4186 J/(kg·°C). So when I computed Q as 31,395,000 J, that's correct. Then, 31,395,000 /4184 = Approximately 7503 kcal. So about 7500 kcal.

Looking at the options, option F is 8.5e3, which is 8500 kcal. Option C is 7.5e3. Hmm. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's compute 31,395,000 /4184.

Let me try a precise division.

Compute 31,395,000 ÷4184.

Let me do 31,395,000 ÷4184.

Well, 4184 ×7000 = 4184 *7,000= 29,288,000.

31,395,000 -29,288,000 =2,107,000.

Now, 4184 ×500= 2,092,000.

Subtract: 2,107,000 - 2,092,000 =15,000.

Now, 4184 ×3=12,552. 15,000-12,552=2,448.

4184 ×0.586 (approx) = 2448. So total is 7000+500+3=7503.586.

So, approximately 7503.59 kcal.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 8.5e3 (8500) and option C: 7.5e3 (7500). So it's about 7.5e3, which is option C.

Wait, but wait—what if I made a mistake in the volume? Let me double-check.

Wait, 2.5 m is 250 cm, 50 cm, 60 mm which is 6 cm. So 250 *50=12,500. 12,500 *6=75,000 cm³. So 75 L. So correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the wrong specific heat capacity. Wait, specific heat of water is 1 cal/(g·°C), which is 4.184 J/(g·°C). So 75,000 grams (since 75 L is 75 kg, which is 75,000 g) → 75,000 g.

So Q = mass * c * delta T.

c is 1 cal/(g·°C).

c = 1 cal/(g·°C) → 4184 J/(kg·°C).

So, mass is 75,000 g.

So Q =75,000 *4184 *100 = 75,000 *4184 *100.

Wait, 75,000 *4184 = 313,800,000. Multiply by 100 gives 31,380,000,000 J.

Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, because I'm using c in cal/(g·°C).

Wait, maybe I messed up the units in the beginning. Let me try to compute again with correct units.

Alternatively, perhaps using c in J/(kg·°C) is correct.

Wait, perhaps the container's volume is not 75 liters. Let me compute the volume again.

Wait, 2.5 m is 250 cm, 50 cm, 60 mm=6 cm.

So 250 *50 =12500; 12500 *6=75000 cm³ → 75 L → 75 kg.

I think that's correct.

Hmm, but the calculation I did earlier gives about 7.5e3 kcal, which is option C. But the options don't have 7500. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:7.0e3

B:8.0e3

C:7.5e3

D:5.5e3

E:9.5e3

F:8.5e3

G:6.5e3

H:6.0e3

I:9.5e3

J:9.0e3

So, 7.5e3 is option C. So according to my calculation, the answer should be C.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the container is filled with 32°F water, and we need to heat it to 212°F, which is 180°F. So 100°C. Correct.

Wait, but in the options, option F is 8.5e3, option C is7.5e3. My calculation is about 7.5e3, so option C.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the amount of heat in kilocalories, but I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute again.

Q = m * c * ΔT.

m = 75 kg.

c = 4186 J/(kg·°C).

ΔT = 100 °C.

So Q =75 *4186 *100 J.

Compute 75 *4186 first.

4186 *75.

75 ×4000 =300000.

75 ×186 = (75 ×100) + (75 ×80) + (75 ×6) ) → 7500 +6000 +450 = 7500+6000=13500 +450=13950.

So 300000 +13950 =313,950. So 313,950 ×100 =31,395,000 J.

Convert to kcal: 31,395,000 J ÷4184 J/kcal ≈7503.59 kcal.

So approximately 7500 kcal, which is 7.5e3, which is option C.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the container's volume is 75.0 m³? No, that's not correct. Because 2.5 m in length, 50 cm (0.5 m), and 60 mm (0.06 m), so 2.5 *0.5 =1.25; 1.25 *0.06=0.075 m³. Which is 75 liters, which is correct.

Wait, I think I'm confident with option C. So the answer should be option C.
</think>

The container has dimensions of 2.5 m × 50 cm × 60 mm, which convert to 250 cm × 50 cm × 6 cm. The volume is calculated as:

\[
250 \, \text{cm} \times 50 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 75,000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 75 \, \text{L} = 75 \, \text{kg}.
\]

The water is initially at 32°F, and we need to heat it to 212°F, which is a temperature change of:

\[
212^\circ\text{F} - 32^\circ\text{F} = 180^\circ\text{F}.
\]

Since 1°F = 0.5556°C, the temperature change in Celsius is:

\[
180^\circ\text{F} \times 0.5556 \, \text{°C/°F} \approx 100^\circ\text{C}.
\]

The specific heat capacity of water is approximately \(4186 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)}\). Using the formula \(Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T\), the heat required is:

\[
Q = 75 \, \text{kg} \times 4186 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)} \times 100 \, \text{°C}.
\]

First, calculate \(75 \times 4186\):

\[
75 \times 4186 = 313,950.
\]

Then, multiply by 100:

\[
313,950 \times 100 = 31,395,000 \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert joules to kilocalories using \(1 \, \text{kcal} = 4184 \, \text{J}\):

\[
Q = \frac{31,395,000 \, \text{J}}{4184 \, \text{J/kcal}} \approx 7503.59 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

This value is approximately 7.5 × 10³ kcal, which corresponds to **option C**.
