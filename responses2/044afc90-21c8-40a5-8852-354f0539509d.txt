Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a rancher dropping hay bales from an airplane. Hmm, I need to figure out how far behind the cattle the bales should land. Let's see what the question says again.

The plane is moving horizontally at 160 km/h, and the bales are dropped from 80 meters above. She wants them to land 30 meters behind the cattle. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Oh, wait, actually, the question says she wanted them to land 30 m behind, so maybe the answer is 30 m? But that doesn't fit the options. Oh wait, no, looking at the options, option F is 100 m, which isn't in the 30 vicinity. Wait, no, wait the question says she wanted the bales to land 30 m behind the cattle, so maybe it's 30 m. But the options don't have 30. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check.

Wait, wait, maybe the question is the other way. The problem is asking how far behind she should push the bales out. Oh, right, no, the question is actually about the distance from the plane's flight path to where the bales land. So the question is, after the bales are dropped, they hit the ground 30 meters behind the plane's path. So how far from the plane does she need to push the bales so they land that far.

Wait, wait, no, the setup says the plane flies horizontally, and the bales are dropped. The question is phrased as: she wanted the bales to land 30 m behind the cattle, so how far behind should she push them out of the plane. Oh, I think the question is asking the distance the bales travel horizontally before hitting the ground, relative to the point where they were released. So the bales are released at a height of 80 m, and they hit the ground 30 m behind where they were directly below. So the horizontal distance from the plane's flight path when the bales are released is 30 m. So the answer should be 30 m, but looking at the options, I don't see 30. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: "she wanted the bales of hay to land 30 m behind the cattle so as to not hit them. How far behind the cattle should she push the bales out of the airplane?"

Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Maybe the question is not about how far behind the plane's path the bales land, but how far behind the plane, in the horizontal direction, are the bales when they hit the ground. Because if the plane was moving, the bales would be in a different spot when they hit the ground.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the horizontal distance from the release point to where the bales land, relative to the release point. So the bales are released at a certain point, and they land 30 meters behind that point. So the horizontal displacement would be 30 m. But the options don't have 30. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, the question is actually about how far behind the plane should she push the bales out. Oh, maybe the question is asking for the distance between the point where the bales land and where the plane was when they were released. So, if the plane is moving horizontally, when the bales are released, the plane is somewhere ahead, and the bales land 30m behind that point. So how far behind should she push the bales? Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the horizontal distance from the release point to the point where the bales land. So the answer would be 30 m. But that's not an option. The options are all multiples of 30, like 120, 150, etc., except F is 100, which isn't 30. Wait, maybe I'm getting the problem wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking the opposite. Maybe the plane is moving, and the bales are dropped, so their path is not purely horizontal. So the plane is moving forward at 160 km/h. The bales are dropped from 80 m, but they have the horizontal speed of the plane when they're released. So the bales will have some horizontal motion as they fall, but the plane's horizontal speed is 160 km/h, so the bales will land behind the point where the plane was when they were released.

Wait, but the problem states that the plane is moving horizontally at 160 km/h, but the bales are dropped from a height. So when the bales are in free fall, they have horizontal velocity equal to the plane's speed at the time of release. So they will land 30 m behind the point where they were dropped. So the horizontal distance from where they were released (the point directly below) is 30 m. But since the plane is moving, the point where the bales land relative to the plane is 30 m behind.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about this step by step.

The problem is about projectile motion. So when the bales are released, they have two components of velocity: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal component is the same as the plane's speed (160 km/h), and the vertical component is zero at the moment of release. The bales will fall 80 meters, so we can calculate the time it takes to fall, and then find the horizontal distance they travel during that time.

Wait, wait, no. Because when you drop something from a height, the horizontal velocity is the same as the object's initial horizontal speed. But in this case, the plane is moving, so when the bales are released, their horizontal speed is the same as the plane's at the moment of release. So the bales will have a horizontal velocity of 160 km/h, and their vertical motion is free fall.

So the time to fall is determined by the vertical motion. Let's compute that.

The vertical motion: initial velocity (vy) is 0, height (h) is 80 m.

Using the equation h = ½ g t², where g is 9.8 m/s².

So 80 = 0.5 * 9.8 * t².

Solving for t: t² = (80 * 2) / 9.8 ≈ 160 /9.8 ≈ 16.3265. So t ≈ sqrt(16.3265) ≈ 4.0408 seconds.

So the time it takes for the bales to hit the ground is approximately 4.04 seconds.

Now, the horizontal distance the bales travel during this time is v * t, where v is the horizontal speed, which is 160 km/h. But wait, I should convert that to m/s.

160 km/h = (160 * 1000) m / (3600 s) = (160,000) / 3600 ≈ 44.444 m/s.

So the horizontal distance is 44.444 m/s * 4.0408 s ≈ Let me calculate that: 44.444 *4.04 ≈ 44 *4 = 176, 44*0.04=1.76, 0.444*4=1.776, 0.444*0.04=0.01776. Adding all: 176 + 1.76=177.76 +1.776=179.536 +0.01776=179.55376 meters.

Wait, that's about 179.55 meters. So approximately 180 meters.

Looking at the options, option E is 180 m.

But wait, the question is about how far behind the plane should she push the bales. So when the bales are released, they land 180 meters behind the plane's release point. But how far from the plane does she need to push the bales out. Oh, perhaps she is dropping them from a certain height, and the bales will fall 80 m. But the horizontal distance would be the distance she pushes them behind the plane. So the answer is approximately 180 m, which is option E.

Wait, but wait, the question says, "how far behind the cattle should she push the bales out of the airplane." Oh, wait, the plane is moving, so the bales will land behind the point where they were when released. So the distance behind the plane's flight path is 180 m. But the plane was moving, so the distance from the release point to the landing point relative to the plane's path is 180 m. So the answer is 180 m, option E.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option E is 180 m. So that would be the correct answer.

The problem involves a rancher dropping hay bales from an airplane moving horizontally at 160 km/h. The bales are released from a height of 80 m and are aimed to land 30 m behind the cattle. The goal is to determine how far behind the plane the bales should be released relative to the plane's flight path.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Horizontal Motion**:  
   The bales are released with the same horizontal velocity as the plane (160 km/h). Converting this to meters per second:  
   \[
   160 \, \text{km/h} = \frac{160 \times 1000}{3600} \approx 44.44 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]

2. **Vertical Motion**:  
   The bales are in free fall, starting from a height of 80 m. Using the equation for vertical displacement under constant acceleration:  
   \[
   h = \frac{1}{2} g t^2,
   \]  
   where \( h = 80 \, \text{m} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Solving for \( t \):  
   \[
   t^2 = \frac{2h}{g} = \frac{2 \times 80}{9.8} \approx 16.3265, \quad t \approx \sqrt{16.3265} \approx 4.04 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

3. **Horizontal Distance**:  
   The horizontal distance traveled by the bales is:  
   \[
   d = v \times t = 44.44 \, \text{m/s} \times 4.04 \, \text{s} \approx 179.55 \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   This is approximately 180 m.

4. **Interpretation**:  
   The bales land 180 meters behind the point where they were released relative to the plane's flight path. Since the plane is moving horizontally, the bales will land 180 meters behind the plane's path when they are released.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **180 m**, which corresponds to option **E**.
