Question:

A theater collected $6 for each ticket sold to a movie. The theater sold 500 tickets to the movie. The expression below can be used to find how much money the theater collected for the tickets. 6 × 500 Which expression can also be used to find how much money the theater collected for the tickets?

Options:

A: (6 × 5) × 10^1
B: 30 × 10^1
C: (6 × 5) × 10^2
D: 600 × 50
E: (6 × 5) × 10^3
F: (6 × 500) × 10^1
G: 30 × 10^3
H: 60 × 10^2

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about finding an equivalent expression to calculate how much money the theater made from selling tickets. The original expression given is 6 multiplied by 500, right? Which makes sense because each ticket is $6 and they sold 500 tickets. So, 6*500 equals 3000, which is the total amount collected.

Now, the question is asking which other expression can be used to find the same amount. The options are A to H. I need to look at each one and see if it simplifies to 3000 or not.

Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: (6 × 5) × 10^1. So, 6×5 is 30, then multiply by 10. That would be 300. Wait, that's only $300, which is way less than 3000. So, A is not correct.

Option B: 30 × 10^1. 10^1 is 10, so 30×10 is 300. Again, same as A. So B is also incorrect.

Option C: (6 × 5) × 10^2. 6×5 is 30, times 100 (since 10^2 is 100) is 3000. Oh, that's the same as the original. So C is correct.

Option D: 600 × 50. Let me calculate that. 600×50 is 30,000. That's way more than 3000. So D is wrong.

Option E: (6 ×5) × 10^3. 6×5 is 30, ×1000 is 30,000. That's even bigger than D, so E is incorrect.

Option F: (6 ×500) ×10^1. 6×500 is 3000, ×10 is 30,000. Again, more than needed. So F is wrong.

Option G: 30 ×10^3. 30 ×1000 is 30,000. Same as E, so G is incorrect.

Option H: 60 ×10^2. 60×100 is 6000. Wait, 6000 is larger than 3000. Hmm, but wait, 6000 is double 3000. Did I do that right? Let me check. 60 ×100 is 6000. Oh, yes, that’s correct. So H calculates to 6000, which is $6000, not 3000. So H is incorrect.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, the original was 6 * 500 = 3000. So, H gives 60 × 100 = 6000. So that's double the original. So H is not equal to the original expression.

But wait, looking back, is there another way to express 3000 as an expression? Maybe in terms of different factors. Let me think about other options.

Wait, option C is correct as I found earlier. So C is (6 ×5) ×10^2 which is 30 ×100=3000. So that's correct. So the correct answer is C.

The correct expression is C: (6 × 5) × 10^2, which equals 30 × 100 = 3000. 

Answer: C
