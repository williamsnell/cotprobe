Okay, I have this genetics problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes. Oh wait, the question says it's an adihybridcross, which I think refers to a cross where both parents are heterozygous for both traits. Hmm, but wait, the question gives the parents as CCBB × ccbb. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So perhaps I should just focus on the main question.

Wait, no, the question is asking for a Punnett square for an adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Oh, wait, so one parent is homozygous for both traits, and the other is homozygous for the other traits. Let me parse that.

Wait, CCBB is the genotype. So C is dominant for color C (checkered), and c is recessive for color c (plain). So CC is homozygous dominant for color C, which would be checkered. B is dominant for red, so BB or Bb would be red. And bb would be brown.

The other parent is ccbb. So c is recessive for color c, and bb is recessive for color B. So this bird is homozygous for both traits: plain color (c), and brown (bb). So the other bird's genotype is ccbb.

So the cross is between a homozygous checkered red bird (CCBB) and a homozygous plain brown bird (ccbb). Wait, no, wait: wait the first parent is CCBB. So CC is dominant for color C (so it's checkered), BB is dominant for B (red). So the first bird is homozygous for both dominant traits: checkered and red. The second bird is ccbb: meaning they're homozygous for both recessive: plain color (c) and brown (bb). So this bird is plain brown.

Wait, that makes sense. So the F1 generation would be the cross of CCBB (checkered red) and ccbb (plain brown). Let me think about the F1 genotypes. Since each parent is homozygous, all F1 would be CC × cc and BB × bb.

Wait, no. Wait, wait: Wait CCBB is a bird with two dominant alleles for both traits. CC is dominant for color (C is dominant), so it's CC (so checkered). BB is dominant for B (red), so it's BB (red). So the bird is CCBB, which is checkered red. Its genotype will be CC (for color) and BB (for B). So for each gene, it's homozygous dominant.

The other parent is ccbb: that's cc (plain color) and bb (brown). So each gene is recessive. So the F1 would all be CC × cc and BB × bb, so the F1 would be Cc for the first gene and Bb for the second gene. So CcBb.

Now, the question is about the F2 generation. Wait, wait: The question says to show the phenotypic ratios for the F2. So the cross given is for F1 × F1, which is the F2 of the initial parents.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says, "Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation."

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Because the parents are CCBB and ccbb, which are homozygous and thus all F1 would be CC × cc and BB × bb. No, wait, CCBB is a bird with two dominant alleles for both traits, so when crossed with ccbb (two recessive), the F1 would all be CcBb.

Wait, but the question is about the F2 generation. So perhaps the initial cross is F1 × F1, which leads to F2. That would make sense because parents are F1.

Wait, so the parents are F1. So the cross is F1 × F1. So the F1's are CcBb.

Wait, but the question says it's an adihybridcross. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, adihybridcross refers to a cross where the two parents are both homozygous for both traits, but I think that's not the case here. Wait, no, the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So they're both homozygous. So their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would be the F1 selfed.

Wait, but the question asks about the F2 generation. Hmm. Wait, maybe I got the cross wrong. Maybe the parents are CcBb and ccbb. Because that would make an F1 of CcBb, and then F2 would be the selfing of that.

Wait, but the question says, "involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird." So the parents are CCBB and ccbb. So their F1 is CcBb, and then F2 would be the F1 selfed. But perhaps the question is about the F2 of the initial parents, which are CCBB and ccbb. Let me proceed.

Wait, the question says: "the expected phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation." So perhaps the parents are CCBB (homozygous for both dominant traits) and ccbb (homozygous for both recessive traits). So their F1 would be CcBb. Then F2 would be the F1 selfed.

Wait, but the options given are about F2. Let me think about the possible phenotypes.

The traits are: C (dominant, checkered) and c (recessive, plain), B (dominant, red) and b (recessive, brown).

So each bird's genotype determines their phenotype. So for each gene, the phenotype is determined by the dominant allele.

For the first gene (C and c), the bird is either checkered (C) or plain (c). For the second gene (B and b), the bird is either red (B) or brown (b).

So, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both.

Wait, each phenotype is determined by the alleles for each trait. So checkered (C) and red (B) would make it checkered red. Checkered brown would be C and b. Plain red is c and B. Plain brown is c and b.

So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:

1. C B → checkered red
2. C b → checkered brown
3. c B → plain red
4. c b → plain brown

Now, the question is about the F2 ratios. So let's think about the F2 generation.

The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs (F1 × F1), we can create a Punnett square.

Let me construct the F2 genotypes.

The parents are CcBb and CcBb. Each gene is independently assorting.

Each gene segregates as follows:

For the first gene (C and c):
- Probability of C is 50%, c is 50%.

For the second gene (B and b):
- Probability of B is 50%, b is 50%.

So for each gene, the possible gametes are C (50%), c (50%), B (50%), b (50%).

The F2 generation has four possible alleles for each gene, leading to 16 possible combinations. But since the two genes are independent, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes.

So each bird in F2 has a genotype of CcBb (for each gene, but wait, no, the F1 is CcBb, so each gene is Cc and Bb. So when you self that, each gene is Cc and Bb.

Wait, no. Wait, when you self CCBB, the F1 would be CcBb. So each gene is Cc and Bb. So when you cross F1 × F1, each gene in F2 is Cc and Bb.

So the F2 genotypes would be CcBb for each gene.

Wait, no: when you self CcBb (from F1), each gene segregates independently.

For the first gene (C and c):

Probability of CC: 25% (C from parent 1 and C from parent 2)
Probability of Cc: 50%
Probability of cc:25%

Similarly, for the second gene (B and b):

Probability of BB:25%
Bb:50%
bb:25%

So, the F2 would have 16 possible genotype combinations, each with a certain probability.

Now, the phenotypic ratios are based on the combination of the two traits (C and B).

Each bird's phenotype is determined by the dominant allele for each trait.

So for each bird, the phenotype can be:

1. C (dominant) and B (dominant) → checkered red.
2. C dominant, B recessive → checkered brown.
3. c recessive, B dominant → plain red.
4. c recessive, B recessive → plain brown.

Wait, but the other combination is the recessive for both, which is c and b.

So, the possible phenotypes are:

- Checkered red (C B)
- Checkered brown (C b)
- Plain red (c B)
- Plain brown (c b)

Now, the next step is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2.

Each bird's genotype is CcBb.

The probability for each genotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.

So for the first gene (C and c):

Probability of CC: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4
Cc: (1/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(1/2) = 1/2
cc: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4

Same for the second gene (B and b):

Probability of BB: 1/4
Bb: 1/2
bb: 1/4

Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.

So, each of the 16 possible combinations is (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.

But let's think about the phenotypes:

1. C B → 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16
2. C b → 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8
3. c B → 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8
4. c b → 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16

Wait, but no: because the combination is CC × Cc and BB × Bb.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to list all F2 genotypes and their frequencies.

Each gene has 3 possibilities (25% each for Cc and Bb), but for the F2, each gene is CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). So for each gene, 3 phenotypic expressions.

But since the two genes are independent, the total number of phenotypes is 3 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 9 phenotypic categories.

Wait, but that's not right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So each bird has a combination of the two. So the four phenotypic categories are as I mentioned before.

Wait, but I think I'm confusing the approach. Let's think about the phenotypic ratio. Each bird's combination of C and B.

The number of each type is:

1. C B → 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 of the total (since each gene is 1/4 for each possible outcome, and they're independent, so 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for each combination)
Wait, but no. Wait, each gene is Cc (probability 1/2 for C and c), and Bb (probability 1/2 for B and b). So each gene contributes 1/2 to each allele, but the phenotypes are determined by the dominant alleles.

So for each gene, the bird has a 50% chance of being dominant (C or B) and 50% chance of being recessive (c or b). But the two genes are independent, so the phenotypes are determined by the combination.

Each combination of dominant for one and dominant for the other gives a dominant phenotype, or recessive in both.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the frequency of each phenotype.

Each bird's C and B alleles are independent.

So possible combinations:

For C:

- C (dominant) occurs in 50% of cases.

For B:

- B (dominant) occurs in 50% of cases.

Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of the dominant alleles.

So:

1. Both dominant: C and B → dominant for both → checkered red (C B)
Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 (25%)

2. C dominant, B recessive → checkered brown (C b)
Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 (25%)

3. c dominant, B dominant → plain red (c B)
Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 (25%)

4. c dominant, B recessive → plain brown (c b)
Probability: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 (25%)

Wait, that can't be right because the sum would be 4*(1/4) = 1, but the phenotypic ratios must add to 1. So each phenotype has a 25% chance.

Wait, but wait, the options provided in the question do not have any option with a 25% ratio for each phenotype. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6, 2, 6, 2 → phenotypic ratio 6:2:6:2 → 6/16=3/8 each. So 37.5% each.

Option B: 8,4,0,4 → 0.5 each. So 8:4:0:4 → 8/16=0.5, 4/16=0.25, 4/16=0.25. So 0.5:0.25:0:0.25.

Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 → 9+3+3+1=16. So 9/16, etc. So 9:3:3:1 → phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1.

Wait, that's the classic dihybrid cross ratio, which is the same as the F2 of a dihybrid cross.

Wait, but in this case, the parents are F1, so their F2 would be the F1 selfed.

Wait, but in our case, the parents are CcBb (F1) and CcBb (F1). So during selfing, each F1 bird's genotype will be CcBb, and the F2 will be the F1 selfed.

So the F2 would have the same 16 possible genotypes, but their phenotype is determined by the dominant alleles.

Wait, but each bird is CcBb. So each gene is independently Cc and Bb.

So the phenotypic ratios would be as per the combination of dominant and recessive alleles.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. So the F2 would have each phenotype 25% of the time, except for the cases where one of the traits is recessive. Wait, no, no. Because in F2, each gene is independently CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). So the phenotypes for each gene are dominant C (50%) and recessive c (50%).

So the combination of the two would have:

- C dominant and B dominant: 25% (checkered red)
- C dominant and B recessive: 25% (checkered brown)
- c dominant and B dominant: 25% (plain red)
- c dominant and B recessive: 25% (plain brown)

Wait, but wait, that's only possible if each gene has 50% dominant and 50% recessive, leading to each combination being 25% of the population.

Wait, but that would lead to each phenotype having a 25% chance, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which is not any of the options. Because the options have ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. The F2 generation has 16 birds. Each bird has a genotype of CcBb.

Wait, no, the F1 is CcBb. So when selfing, each gene is independent. So the F2 genotypes would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for each gene. So four genes? No, it's two genes. So each bird has a 25% chance for each possible combination of the two genes.

The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.

Wait, but let me think of each bird's phenotype as determined by each gene. So for each bird,:

- Gene 1 (C/B): dominant → C, recessive → c.
- Gene 2 (B/b): dominant → B, recessive → b.

Each gene has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive.

So the phenotypic ratio is the number of birds where either gene is dominant.

Wait, no. The phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So each bird has two traits: one from each gene.

The four phenotypes are:

1. Gene 1 dominant, Gene 2 dominant → C B → Checkered Red.
2. Gene 1 dominant, Gene 2 recessive → C b → Checkered Brown.
3. Gene 1 recessive, Gene 2 dominant → c B → Plain Red.
4. Gene 1 recessive, Gene 2 recessive → c b → Plain Brown.

Each of these is determined by the presence of dominant alleles.

So for each gene, the probability of dominant is 50% (since each gene is Cc and Bb, so dominant is 50%).

So for each gene, the probability of dominant is 50%, and the same for the other gene.

The combination of the two traits determines the phenotype.

So each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene has a dominant allele.

So, the four phenotypes are each possible combinations of the two dominant alleles.

Each phenotypic group has a 25% chance of occurring.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all 25% is 100%. So each phenotype is 25% of the F2 generation.

But none of the options given have a 25% ratio. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 6, 2, 6, 2 → 6:2:6:2 → sum to 16. So each phenotype is 6/16 = 3/8 (37.5%).

B)8,4,0,4 → 8:4:0:4 → sum to 16. Each phenotype is 8/16=0.5, 4/16=0.25, 4/16=0.25.

C)9,3,3,1 → sum to 16. 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16.

D)1,1,1,13 → sum to 16; 1/16 each except 13/16.

Wait, none of these options have a 25% ratio for any phenotype.

Wait, but this suggests that none of the options are correct. But this can't be the case since the question is presented as a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption about the F2 generation.

Wait, the parents are F1 (CcBb) and F1 (CcBb), so their F2 would be the F1 selfed.

Wait, but in reality, the F2 generation would be the F1 selfed, which is the same as F1 × F1.

But perhaps I should model the dihybrid cross between F1 and F1.

Wait, no, in this case, the parents are F1. So their F2 is the F1 selfed.

Wait, but the F2 in this case would have 16 possible genotypes. But the phenotypic ratios would be based on the presence of dominant alleles.

So, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant.

So, the phenotypic ratio would be:

- 25% (C B → checkered red),
- 25% (C b → checkered brown),
- 25% (c B → plain red),
- 25% (c b → plain brown).

But this would result in a ratio of 1:1:1:1.

But none of the options given have such a ratio. Wait, let's look again.

Option C: phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.

Ah, that's the classic dihybrid cross ratio. So, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the parents for the F2 are F1.

Wait, perhaps the parents are F1 and F1, and the F2 is their cross. So that they're doing a dihybrid cross.

Wait, but in that case, the F2 would have the phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1.

But wait, the options given don't have any option with a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A) checkered red:6, checkered brown:2, plain red:6, plain brown:2 → 6:2:6:2.

B) checkered red:8, checkered brown:4, plain red:0, plain brown:4 → 8:4:0:4.

C) checkered red:9, checkered brown:3, plain red:3, plain brown:1 → 9:3:3:1.

D) checkered red:1, checkered brown:1, plain red:1, plain brown:13 → 1:1:1:13.

Wait, but none of the options except C have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is the dihybrid cross ratio.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that parents are F1 × F1. Wait, no, the question says the parents are F1 × F1. So the F2 would be their dihybrid cross, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.

But the question says that the parents are F1 and F1, so their F2 would be the F1 selfed.

Wait, but in this case, the F2 would be the F1 selfed, which is a dihybrid cross, leading to 9:3:3:1.

So, the correct option is C.

Wait, but the options in the question don't have option C as the correct one. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the options are:

A: 6,2,6,2 → 6:2:6:2 → 6/16 = 3/8 each.

B: 8,4,0,4 → 8:4:0:4 → 8/16=0.5, 4:4=0.25, 4:4=0.25.

C:9,3,3,1 → 9:3:3:1 → which is the classic dihybrid cross ratio.

D:1,1,1,13 → 1:1:1:13.

Hmm, so if the F2 is the dihybrid cross (F1 × F1), then the ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Which is option C.

But wait, the options in the question don't have option C as the correct answer. Wait, looking back, the options given are:

A: 6,2,6,2 → 6:2:6:2 → 3/8 each.

B:8,4,0,4 → 0.5, 0.25, 0.25.

C:9,3,3,1 → 9:3:3:1.

D:1,1,1,13 → 1:1:1:13.

So, the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, the initial assumption was that the parents are F1 and F1, so the F2 would be their dihybrid cross, leading to 9:3:3:1.

Which is option C.

So, the correct answer would be option C.
</think>

The question involves determining the phenotypic ratios of a dihybrid cross when two parents, both of genotype CcBb, are crossed. The parents are F1, and their F2 generation is calculated based on Mendel's laws of inheritance.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Phenotype Determination**:
   - Each bird's genotype determines its phenotype based on the dominance of alleles.
   - A bird with genotype **C_B_** (C dominant, B dominant) is **Checkered Red**.
   - A bird with genotype **C_bb** (C dominant, b recessive) is **Checkered Brown**.
   - A bird with genotype **ccB_** (c recessive, B dominant) is **Plain Red**.
   - A bird with genotype **ccbb** (c recessive, b recessive) is **Plain Brown**.

2. **Genotype Frequencies**:
   - Each gene (C and B) segregates independently into the F2 generation.
   - The F2 generation consists of 16 possible genotype combinations.
   - Each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles:
     - **Checkered Red (C B)**: 25% of the population.
     - **Checkered Brown (C b)**: 25% of the population.
     - **Plain Red (c B)**: 25% of the population.
     - **Plain Brown (c b)**: 25% of the population.

3. **Phenotypic Ratio**:
   - Since each phenotype occurs with equal probability (25%), the phenotypic ratio would appear as **1:1:1:1**.
   - However, none of the provided options match this ratio.

4. **Re-examining the Question**:
   - The question asks for the **F2 generation** of a dihybrid cross.
   - The correct phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross (F2) is **9:3:3:1**, which corresponds to **Checkered Red:Checkered Brown:Plain Red:Plain Brown**.
   - This ratio is consistent with the classic dihybrid cross in Mendelian genetics.

5. **Matching the Options**:
   - Option C provides the ratio **9:3:3:1**, which matches the **9:3:3:1** phenotypic ratio from a dihybrid cross.

### Conclusion:
The correct phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation is **9:3:3:1**, which corresponds to **Option C**.

ANSWER: C
