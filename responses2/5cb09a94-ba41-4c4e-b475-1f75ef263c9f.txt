Okay, so I need to figure out how much George earned last week selling vacuum cleaners. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, the question says that George sells each vacuum cleaner for $75. He gets a 30% commission on each sale. Last week, he sold 13 machines. So, I need to calculate his total earnings by multiplying the number of units sold by the commission rate and then by the price per unit.

Hmm, let's break it down. The commission per sale is 30%, which is the same as 0.3 in decimal form. Each vacuum is sold for $75. So, the commission for one vacuum is 75 multiplied by 0.3. Let me do that calculation: 75 * 0.3 equals 22.5. So, he makes $22.50 commission per vacuum.

Now, he sold 13 of these. To find the total commission, I multiply the commission per unit by the number of units: 22.5 * 13. Let's calculate that. 22.5 times 10 is 225, and 22.5 times 3 is 67.5. Adding those together gives 225 + 67.5 = 292.5.

Wait, but the question is about his total earnings, which includes both the sales and the commission. Oh, wait no, the question says he sells each for $75, but I think the $75 is the selling price, and the commission is on top. So, his total earnings would be the total sales plus commission. Or wait, no, maybe the question is only about commission. Let me check the question again.

The question says he sells each for $75 and receives a 30% commission. So, his commission is 30% of 75, which we already calculated as $22.50 per unit. For 13 units, that's 22.5 *13 = 292.50. So, $292.50.

Looking at the options, option J is $292.50. But wait, let me double-check if I added the sales and commission correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the commission is on top, but the question says he sells each for $75, so perhaps the total sales revenue is 75 *13, and then he gets 30% commission on that.

Wait, no, the way I initially thought is correct. Because the commission is a percentage of the selling price. So, each sale's commission is 30% of 75, not 30% of the total sales. So, each sale gives him $22.50, and 13 sales give 22.50 *13 = 292.50, which is $292.50. So, option J is the correct answer. But wait, looking at the options again: option J is $292.50. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, wait. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake. The question asks for his total earnings. If he sells each for $75 and gets a 30% commission on each, then total commission is 13 * (0.3 *75). Let's compute that: 0.3*75 is 22.5, times 13 is 292.5. So yes, that's correct. So the total earnings are $292.50.

Looking at the options, option J is $292.50. So that's the correct answer.

George sells each vacuum cleaner for $75 and earns a 30% commission on each sale. To find his total earnings for last week:

1. Calculate commission per unit: 30% of $75 = $22.50.
2. Multiply by the number of units sold (13): $22.50 * 13 = $292.50.

The correct answer is J: $292.50.
