Okay, so I have this real estate question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on property law, but I'll do my best.

The scenario is that a man owned real estate in fee simple. Then, he transferred a life estate in it to his friend. Now, when the fee simple owner died, the life estate owner conveyed his interest to his children. The question is, did the children get an enforceable interest in the property? The options are A to H, with the correct answer among them.

First, I need to remember how life estates work. A life estate is a type of estate that automatically ends when the owner's life ends. So, when someone gets a life estate, they have a right to the property until they die. Once they die, the life estate automatically terminates.

In this case, the fee simple owner died, and the life estate owner (probably his son) transferred it to his children. So, the life estate is essentially transferred to the children.

Now, the key point here is whether the children get an enforceable interest. I think that when a life estate is transferred, the interests don't automatically revert unless specific circumstances happen. Also, the life estate is a life estate, so it's a future interest, not a possessory one. But when you transfer a life estate, do you automatically become a life estate holder? Or does it fall under a fee simple interest?

Wait, if someone takes a life estate, they become a life estate holder. But that's only if they are not transferring it. Oh wait, when they transfer it, the life estate is transferred, and the subsequent owner (the children) would have a fee simple interest? No, wait, that's not right. The children would have a fee simple interest? Or a life estate? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let's think: When the fee simple owner dies, the life estate automatically ends, and the property goes back to the fee simple owner's estate. Now, the life estate owner (let's say his son) conveys it to his children. So, the life estate is transferred. So, the children actually get a life estate. Wait, no. Because when you transfer a life estate, you become a life estate holder, but the property's ownership then goes back to who receives it. Because the life estate is a future interest, if the owner dies, the estate would automatically terminate. So, if the life estate is transferred, the subsequent owner (children) still have a life estate. Because the life estate is a life estate, the children would have it. Wait, but can they transfer it?

Wait, let me clarify. The life estate is a life estate. So, if the owner (the life estate owner) dies, the life estate ends, and the property goes back to the fee simple owner's estate. Now, if the life estate owner conveys it to his children, does that mean that the children now have a life estate? Or no, because the life estate is a future interest, and the transfer would transfer that future interest. So, since the children are the ones getting it, does that mean they have a life estate, or a fee simple interest?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall some real estate principles.

1. A life estate is a future interest. It automatically ends when the life estate owner dies, and the property reverts to the fee simple owner's estate.

2. When the life estate owner conveys it to others, those others become life estate holders. So, the children, upon receiving the life estate, would have a life estate. Because the transfer is of the future interest.

Wait, but another possibility: if the life estate is transferred, the property reverts back to the fee simple owner's estate. But if the life estate is transferred to the children, the children would have a fee simple interest because they are the ones receiving the property after the life estate ends.

Wait, no. Because the life estate is a future interest. If the owner dies, the estate ends, and the property goes back to the fee simple owner's estate. So, if the life estate is conveyed to the children, the children would have a fee simple interest. Because the property is no longer with the life estate owner's estate (since he died and the estate ended), so the children can't have a fee simple interest. But they have a life estate, because it was transferred.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think: If the life estate is transferred, the children receive it. The property's future interest is with the children. So, the children have the life estate. So, they would have a life estate, not a fee simple.

Wait, but the fee simple owner died, so the property reverts. So, when the life estate is transferred, the property is still with the life estate owner's estate. But the life estate is a future interest. So, if the life estate is taken by the children, they have a life estate. Because the future interest is with them.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the options.

The options are about whether the children have an enforceable interest. The question is, does the children now have the fee simple or the life estate.

Option D says yes, the children own the property in fee simple. Option E says no, because the life estate ended, and the property reverts back. Option C says yes, the life estate owner became the owner in fee simple, which doesn't make sense because the fee simple owner died and the estate ended.

Wait, so when the fee simple owner dies, the life estate ends, and the property goes back to the fee simple owner's estate. Then, the life estate owner conveys it to his children. So the children have a life estate, because they are the ones who received the property after the life estate ended. Therefore, the children have a life estate, not a fee simple. So option D is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck because I'm not sure if the children have a fee simple interest or a life estate. Let me think again. The life estate ends when the owner (life estate owner) dies. The property then goes back to the fee simple owner's estate. Then, the life estate owner conveys it to the children. So, the children now have a life estate because they are the ones who get the property after the life estate ended. Therefore, they have the life estate, which is a future interest, so they can collect the property as a life estate holder.

Wait, but the options. Let me look at the options again. Option D says yes, the children own the property in fee simple. No, because the estate ended, so the property is with the fee simple owner's estate. The children, having the life estate, would have it. So D would be correct.

Wait, but wait. When the fee simple owner dies, the life estate ends, and the property goes back to the fee simple owner's estate. Then, the life estate owner conveys it to children. So the children have the life estate, which is a future interest. So they can collect the property as a life estate holder. So they would have a life estate, not a fee simple.

So the correct answer would be D: Yes, the children of the life estate owner now own the property in fee simple. Wait, no, because the property is now with the life estate owner's estate, but the children have a life estate. So the children don't own the property in fee simple; they have a life estate. So the answer would be D? Or wait, maybe I got that mixed up.

Wait, the options are about whether the children have an enforceable interest. So, when the fee simple owner dies, the life estate ends, and the property goes back to the fee simple owner's estate. The life estate owner then conveys it to the children. So the children now have a life estate, not a fee simple. So the children's interest is a life estate.

Looking at the options:

A: No, life estate broken. That can't be right because the life estate is a life estate; if the owner dies, the estate ends, but the transfer to the children doesn't break the life estate. The life estate continues, but the property is no longer with the life estate owner.

Wait, no. When the life estate ends, the property goes back to the fee simple owner's estate. The children have a life estate, which is a future interest. So they can collect it upon their father's death.

So option D says yes, the children now own the property in fee simple. That can't be correct because the estate ended, so the property is with the fee simple owner's estate. The children have a life estate, which is a future interest, so they can take it.

Wait, but the options are about the children's status. So the children are now life estate holders. Therefore, they have a life estate, not a fee simple. So the children's interest is a life estate, not a fee simple. So option D would be incorrect because it says they own in fee simple. Option E says no, because the life estate ended. But the children have a life estate.

Wait, no, the children have a life estate. Therefore, option D is correct.

Wait, but I thought the fee simple owner died, so the property goes back to the owner's estate, and the children now have a life estate. So the answer is D.

The question revolves around the transfer of a life estate in fee simple and its subsequent transfer to children upon the death of the original fee simple owner. To analyze the options, it's essential to understand the nature of life estates and their termination.

1. **Understanding Life Estate**: A life estate is a future interest that automatically ends when the owner's life ends. Upon death, the property reverts to the fee simple owner's estate.

2. **Transfer of Life Estate**: When the fee simple owner conveys the life estate to their children, the children inherit the life estate. This transfer transfers the future interest from the life estate owner to the children, giving them a life estate.

3. **Property Reversion**: The property reverts back to the fee simple owner's estate upon the owner's death. The children, now holding the life estate, will have it until they die.

4. **Evaluating Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The life estate is not broken; it continues to vest in the children upon their father's death.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. Life estates are not prohibited from being transferred; they are merely transferred.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Life estates are not automatically transferred; they must be transferred to third parties.
   - **Option D**: Correct. The children now own the property in a life estate, allowing them to collect the property as a life estate holder.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The life estate does not terminate; it continues to vest in the children.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. A leasehold is not a life estate; the children have a life estate.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. conveyances can transfer life estates, but they are not prohibited.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The life estate does not terminate upon the death of the life estate owner; it reverts to the fee simple owner's estate.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The children inherit the life estate upon the father's death, not the fee simple estate.

The correct answer is **D**, as the children now own the property in a life estate.
