Okay, so I've got this transformer question to solve. Hmm, let's see. The problem is about finding the regulation and efficiency of a transformer at full load. I remember that regulation is the percentage drop in voltage at full load compared to no load, and efficiency is the output over input.

The given transformer is a 15 kVA, 2400/240 V distribution transformer. So, high voltage side is 2400 V, low is 240 V. The data from the tests are V_H = 74.5 V, V_X = 240 V, I_H = 6.25 A, I_X = 1.70 A, P_H = 237 W, P_X = 84 W. The frequency is 60 Hz, and the phase angle theta is 25 degrees. Also, the direct current resistances at 25°C are R_dcH = 2.80 ohms and R_dcX = 0.0276 ohms.

Wait, so to compute regulation, I think the formula is (V_L - V_H)/(V_L) * 100. But wait, no, because regulation is the drop at full load. So regulation = (Vno-load - Vfull)/(Vno-load) * 100. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no, regulation is (Vno-load - Vfull) / Vno-load * 100. So let me think.

But wait, how do I find Vno-load? Because at no load, the open circuit voltage is the same as the high voltage, right? Because in no load conditions, the secondary is open, so the voltage would be the same as the open circuit voltage. Or wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the open circuit voltage with the no-load voltage. No, wait, the open circuit voltage is the voltage across the secondary when open, which is the same as the secondary's voltage under no load conditions. But wait, the no-load voltage is the voltage when the transformer is supplying current at no load. Hmm, maybe I got that mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the short circuit test. The short circuit test gives the no-load current. Because when you short the secondary, the current flows through the resistance, and you can find the current. The open circuit voltage would be the voltage across the secondary when open, which is the same as the no-load voltage? Or wait, no, because when the secondary is open, the current would be the no load current, and the voltage drop is due to the resistance.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, I need to find the full load current and voltage. Oh, but the data given is for short circuit and open circuit tests, so perhaps I can find the full load current from the short circuit data.

Wait, the short circuit test: the open circuit voltage is V_X. So when the secondary is open, the current is I_X which is 1.70 A. So the resistance R_dcX is 0.0276 ohms. So, from this, we can calculate the voltage drop across R_dcX when a current flows.

Wait, so in the open circuit test, R_dcX = V_X / I_X. Let's check that. V_X is 240 V, I_X is 1.70 A. 240 / 1.70 ≈ 141.18 ohms. But R_dcX is given as 0.0276 ohms. That doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Oh wait, no, no, wait. Open circuit voltage is 240 V. So when the secondary is open, the current is I_X (1.70 A). So the voltage drop across R_dcX is V_X = I_X * R_dcX. Let's compute that. 1.70 A * 0.0276 ohms = 0.04692 V. But V_X is 240 V. That can't be. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data.

Wait, perhaps the data is the short-circuit current. So in the open circuit test, the V_X is 240 V, which is the open voltage. So, the open circuit voltage is 240 V. So the R_dcX is the resistance of the impedance under open circuit. So R_dcX = V_X / I_X. So 240 V / 1.70 A ≈ 141.18 ohms. But the given R_dcX is 0.0276 ohms. Hmm, that's way smaller. So perhaps the data is for the short circuit current, not the open voltage. Wait, the problem says "open-circuit test V_H = 74.5 V". So V_H is 74.5 V, which is the open-circuit voltage. So R_dcH = 2.80 ohms. So R_dcH = V_H / I_H. I_H is 6.25 A. 74.5 /6.25 = ~12 ohms. But R_dcH is given as 2.80 ohms. Again, not matching. So perhaps the given R_dcH and R_dcX are for the full load current. Wait, that can't be right because the test data is for open and short circuits.

Wait, maybe the given R_dcH and R_dcX are the direct current resistances (R_d), which are the resistance of the iron and core, not the secondary resistance. Because in the short circuit test, when the secondary is open, the current flows through R_d and R_dcX. So the total resistance is R_d (secondary resistance) plus R_dcX (resistance due to open circuit voltage). So perhaps R_d = R_dcH - R_dcX. Let me calculate that.

R_dcH = 2.80 ohms (R_d when open circuit). R_dcX = 0.0276 ohms. So R_d = R_dcH - R_dcX = 2.80 - 0.0276 = 2.7724 ohms. Hmm, that's the resistance of the iron, etc. Now, when the secondary is loaded, the current flows through R_d and R_dcX. So for the full load current, the voltage drop is I_L * (R_d + R_dcX).

Wait, but in the short circuit test, the current is I_X (1.70 A), and the voltage is V_X (240 V). So R_d + R_dcX = 240 V / I_X = 240 /1.70 ≈ 141.18 ohms. But R_d is 2.7724 ohms, and R_dcX is 0.0276. So 2.7724 + 0.0276 is 2.8 ohms. Wait, but 240 /1.70 is 141.18 ohms, which is way bigger than R_d + R_dcX. So perhaps the given R_dcH and R_dcX are for full load? That doesn't make sense. I must be misunderstanding something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the R_dcH and R_dcX are the resistance of the open circuit. No, because in the open circuit test, the current flows through R_d and R_dcX. So the total resistance is R_d + R_dcX. So perhaps the given R_dcX is the resistance of the open circuit. So R_dcX = 0.0276 ohms. Then, R_d would be R_dcH - R_dcX = 2.80 -0.0276=2.7724 ohms.

Wait, but then for the full load, the voltage drop is I_L * (R_d + R_dcX). Which would be I_L * (2.7724 + 0.0276) = I_L * 2.8 ohms. But that doesn't match anything, because when the current is 6.25 A, the voltage drop would be 6.25 * 2.8 ≈ 17.5 V, but the open circuit voltage is 240 V. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe I'm getting this all wrong.

Wait, perhaps the R_dcH and R_dcX are the values measured during the open circuit test. So R_dcH is the resistance of the transformer's resistance under open circuit. So when the secondary is open, the current I_X flows through R_dcH. So R_dcH is V_X / I_X. Let's calculate that: 240 V / 1.70 A ≈ 141.18 ohms. But the given R_dcH is 2.80 ohms. So that doesn't add up. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps R_dcH isn't the resistance under open circuit but under full load? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the short circuit test is when the secondary is open, so the current is through the resistance. So I'm getting stuck here, perhaps I should find another approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about the full load current. The full load current is when the secondary is loaded. The data given is for short circuit (I_X=1.70 A, V_X=240 V) and open circuit (I_H=6.25 A, V_H=74.5 V). So for the open circuit, the current is 6.25 A, and the voltage is 74.5 V.

Wait, but when the secondary is open, the current is I_X and the voltage is V_X. So the resistance R_dcX is V_X / I_X = 240 / 1.70 ≈ 141.18 ohms. But the given R_dcX is 0.0276 ohms, which is way smaller. That's not matching. So perhaps the data given is for full load instead of short circuit. But the problem says it's a short circuit test.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe the given data is for the transformer's resistance under full load? Because the problem says the data applies to the given transformer. So perhaps I'm getting confused about the test setup.

Wait, the short circuit test is when the secondary is open. So the open circuit voltage is V_X, and the current is I_X. So R_dcX = V_X / I_X. But in the problem, R_dcX is 0.0276, which is way smaller than what I get. So perhaps there's a mistake here, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the R_dcH and R_dcX are the resistance of the transformer under full load, but that doesn't make sense because the short circuit test is about open circuit, not full load. Hmm. This is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the full load current and voltage from the given data.

Given the short circuit current (I_X = 1.70 A), the full load current (I_L) can be found using the ratio of the short circuit current to full load current. But how?

Wait, perhaps the full load current is determined by the open circuit test? No, because the open circuit test is when the secondary is open, not when it's loaded.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of (I_X / I_L) is the ratio of the short circuit current to full load current. But without knowing I_L, I can't find that.

Wait, another approach. The power factor is 25 degrees, which is lagging. So the power factor angle is theta = 25 degrees.

The apparent power under full load is P_L = 237 W ( watts ). So real power (P) is 237 W. The reactive power (Q) can be found using P and the power factor.

Wait, the power factor is cos(theta) = P / S, where S is the apparent power. So S = P / cos(theta) = 237 / cos(25°). Cos(25) is approximately 0.9063. So 237 / 0.9063 ≈ 261.77 W. But wait, I'm not sure if this is correct because the given data might already include the full load data.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the full load current from the short circuit and other parameters. Let me think.

Wait, the transformer's impedance under full load would be the same as under open circuit, but perhaps I'm confusing the two.

Wait, no, under full load, the secondary is carrying current, so the impedance is R_dcH (2.80 ohms) plus R_dcX (0.0276 ohms) plus the secondary resistance. Wait, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the full load voltage using the open circuit voltage and the current ratio. Since in the open circuit, the current is 6.25 A, and in full load, it's I_L.

Wait, but how to find I_L? I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the full load current is the same as the short circuit current? No, because the short circuit is when secondary is open, so current is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the power factor is given, and I can use that to find the current.

Wait, the power factor is cos(theta) = 0.9063. The power factor is P / S, where S is the apparent power. So S = 237 / 0.9063 ≈ 261.77 W. But the data given is for full load, so perhaps S is 261.77 W, but that would mean P is 237 W, which is the real power.

Wait, but the problem says the data applies to the transformer, so perhaps all the data is for the full load. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the data given is for full load. So, then, the open circuit test gives V_X=240 V, and I_X=1.70 A. The open circuit voltage is 240 V, so R_dcX is V_X / I_X = 240 / 1.70 ≈ 141.18 ohms. But the given R_dcX is 0.0276 ohm, so that's way off. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data.

Wait, maybe the given data is for the short circuit, but I'm using the wrong R values. Maybe the R_dcH is the resistance under short circuit, not under open. That can't be right because the short circuit is when the secondary is open.

Alternatively, perhaps the given R_dcH is the resistance under full load. That doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps the given data is for the open circuit test, and I can compute the full load current from the short circuit. But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Another approach: The regulation is (Vno-load - Vfull) / Vno-load * 100. But to find Vfull, I need the secondary voltage under full load. But I don't have that data. Wait, perhaps I can find the secondary current.

Wait, at no load, the current would be zero, so the voltage would be the open circuit voltage (V_H =74.5 V). Wait, no, at no load, the secondary is open, so the current is zero, and the voltage would be the open circuit voltage, which is 74.5 V. So Vno-load is 74.5 V.

Now, full load voltage would be a bit higher or lower than that, depending on the regulation.

Wait, but how do I find the full load voltage? Alternatively, perhaps I can find the secondary current at full load. Let's see.

The short circuit current is 1.70 A, and the full load current is perhaps I_L = ?

Wait, but without knowing the power factor of the full load, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the full load power.

Wait, the full load apparent power is P_L = 237 W. But wait, I'm not sure about this because the given P is under full load condition. But wait, no, the P_H is 237 W, which is the full load power. So S is 237 / cos(25) ≈ 261.77 W.

But I'm not sure how to proceed without more data.

Wait, perhaps the key is to compute the regulation using the given data. Let me think about the formula for regulation.

The regulation is (Vno-load - Vfull) / Vno-load * 100.

So Vno-load is the open circuit voltage, 74.5 V.

Vfull is the secondary voltage under full load. So we need to find the secondary voltage when the current is I_L.

Wait, but without the current, it's tricky. Another approach: The full load current is I_L. The secondary resistance under full load would be R_dcH + R_dcX. Because when full load current flows through both R_dcH and R_dcX (the open circuit resistance), the voltage drop is I_L * (R_dcH + R_dcX).

So, the secondary voltage under full load V_L = V_H (open circuit) - I_L (full load) * (R_dcH + R_dcX).

Wait, but V_H is the open circuit voltage. So V_L = V_H - I_L * (R_dcH + R_dcX).

But I don't know I_L yet.

Wait, perhaps I can find I_L from the short circuit data.

In the short circuit, the current is I_X=1.70 A, which flows through R_dcX. So, R_dcX = V_X / I_X = 240 /1.70 ≈141.18 ohms. But the given R_dcX is 0.0276 ohms, which is way smaller than that. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming R_dcX is 0.0276. Another possibility: The given R_dcH and R_dcX are the measured values under open circuit and full load current, respectively. Wait, but when the secondary is loaded (full load), the current flows through R_d and R_dcX. So in that case, the resistance would be R_d + R_dcX.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should proceed with the given data.

Wait, the problem gives us the open circuit voltage (V_X=240 V), short circuit current (I_X=1.70 A), apparent power (P=237 W), power factor (cos(theta)=0.9063), frequency (60 Hz), and R_dcH=2.80 ohms, R_dcX=0.0276 ohms.

Wait, perhaps the short circuit current is the current when the secondary is shorted, but that's not the case here. Because the short circuit test is when the secondary is open, so the current is through R_d and R_dcX.

Wait, but if the secondary is loaded, the current is I_L, which flows through R_d and R_dcX. So, the voltage drop would be I_L * (R_d + R_dcX).

Wait, but R_d is in the given data. R_d is calculated as R_dcH - R_dcX. R_dcH is the resistance under open circuit, and R_dcX is the resistance under open circuit. So R_d = 2.80 - 0.0276 = 2.7724 ohms.

So, the voltage drop under full load would be I_L * (2.7724 + 0.0276) = I_L * 2.8 ohms.

But I_L is 6.25 A (from the short circuit data, which is when the secondary is shorted, but that's not the case here. Hmm, perhaps this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the short circuit current is when the secondary is shorted, but that's not the case here either. I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the full load voltage using the short circuit data.

Wait, in the short circuit test, the current is I_X=1.70 A, and the voltage is V_X=240 V. So the resistance under short circuit is R_X = V_X / I_X = 240 /1.70 ≈ 141.18 ohms.

But in the formula for the full load, the voltage drop is I_L * (R_d + R_dcX). Where R_d is 2.7724 ohms, R_dcX is 0.0276 ohms. So the total resistance is 2.8 ohms. So the voltage drop is 6.25 A * 2.8 ohms = 17.5 V. So the full load voltage would be V_X (240 V) minus this drop. But that can't be right because 240 -17.5 = 222.5 V, which is less than the open circuit voltage.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So V_L = 240 V - 6.25 A * 2.8 ohms = 240 -17.5 = 222.5 V. Then, the regulation would be (222.5 -74.5)/74.5 *100.

Wait, that gives (148)/74.5 ≈ 2. So the regulation is about 2%. Looking at the options, option C is 2% regulation. But wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, V_L = 240 V - (6.25 A * 2.8 ohms) = 240 - 17.5 = 222.5 V. Then, the regulation is (222.5 V -74.5 V)/74.5 *100 = (148)/74.5 ≈ 2. So 2% regulation. But the options include 2% as C. However, another way to calculate the regulation is to use the open circuit voltage and the open circuit current.

Wait, the open circuit voltage is 74.5 V, and the open circuit current is 6.25 A. The regulation is (VOC - Vopen) / Voc *100. Vopen is 74.5 V, so (74.5 - 74.5)/74.5 *100 =0%, but that can't be because the transformer isn't regulating.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the full load voltage as I_L * (R_d + R_dcX), and then find the regulation as (Vno_load - Vfull) / Vno_load *100. Wait, that would be (74.5 - Vfull)/74.5 *100.

Wait, but earlier calculations gave Vfull as 222.5 V, which would give a negative regulation. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of V_L.

Wait, perhaps the voltage drop is I_L * (R_d + R_dcX), but since the secondary is loaded, the current flows through both the resistance and the impedance. So the voltage across the secondary would be V_L = V_H - I_L*(R_d + R_dcX). But V_H is the open circuit voltage, which is 74.5 V. So V_L = 74.5 - 6.25 * (2.7724 + 0.0276) = 74.5 -6.25 *2.8 = 74.5 -17.5 =57 V. Wait, that can't be right either, because the open circuit voltage should be higher than the secondary voltage under full load.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Because when the secondary is loaded, the current flows through R_d and R_dcX. So the voltage drop is I_L * (R_d + R_dcX). So V_L = V_X - I_L (R_d + R_dcX). But V_X is the open circuit voltage, which is 74.5 V. So V_L =74.5 -6.25*(2.8) =74.5-17.5=57 V. But that would mean the secondary voltage under full load is 57 V, which is lower than the open circuit voltage, which is 74.5 V. That makes sense because under full load, the secondary voltage is lower than the open circuit voltage.

But wait, in this scenario, the secondary voltage under full load is 57 V. Then, the regulation would be (Vno_load - Vfull)/Vno_load *100. Vno_load is 74.5 V. So (74.5 -57)/74.5 *100 = (17.5/74.5)*100 ≈2.35%. But looking at the options, option C is 2% and option A is 1.5%. Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Let me try to compute it again.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating V_L. Let me try again. The open circuit voltage is 74.5 V. The secondary voltage under full load is V_L = 74.5 - (I_L * (R_d + R_dcX)).

Wait, no. Because when the secondary is loaded, the current flows through R_d and R_dcX. So the voltage drop is I_L * (R_d + R_dcX). So the secondary voltage under full load is V_L = V_X - I_L*(R_d + R_dcX).

Wait, but V_X is 74.5 V. So V_L =74.5 - I_L*(2.8). But I_L is 6.25 A. So V_L =74.5 -6.25*2.8 =74.5 -17.5 =57 V. So the secondary voltage under full load is 57 V.

Then, the regulation is (Vno_load - Vfull) / Vno_load *100 = (74.5 -57)/74.5 *100 =17.5/74.5 *100 ≈2.35%. But none of the answer options have 2.35%. The closest is option C, which is 2%. Hmm, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: The power factor is 25 degrees. The apparent power under full load is P_L = 237 W. The real power is P = 237 W * cos(25) ≈237 *0.9063≈215 W. The reactive power Q = P / tan(theta) ≈215 /0.4695≈456 W. But I'm not sure if this is relevant.

Wait, another approach: The regulation can be calculated using the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to compute the regulation using the given data.

So, the open circuit voltage (Vno_load) is 74.5 V.

The short circuit current (Isc) is 1.70 A.

The power factor is 25 degrees, so cos(theta) = 0.9063.

The power is 237 W, so the apparent power S = 237 / 0.9063 ≈261.77 W.

So, the current I = S / Vno_load = 261.77 /74.5 ≈3.516 A.

Wait, but the short circuit current is 1.70 A, and the current at full load is 3.516 A.

Wait, but if the current is 3.516 A at full load, then the voltage would be lower than the open circuit voltage of 74.5 V. But the regulation is (Vno_load - Vfull)/Vno_load *100. So if Vfull is lower than Vno_load, the regulation is positive.

Wait, but earlier calculations gave Vfull as 57 V, which is lower than 74.5 V, giving a positive regulation. The calculation would be (74.5 -57)/74.5 *100 ≈2.35%, which is close to option C (2%).

But none of the options have 2.35%, but option C is 2%, so I'll proceed with that.
</think>

To compute the regulation of the transformer, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine the Open Circuit Voltage (Vno_load):**
   - From the short circuit data, the secondary voltage under full load is **57 V**.

2. **Calculate the Regulation:**
   - The regulation is given by:
     \[
     \text{Regulation} = \frac{(V_{\text{no\_load}} - V_{\text{full}})}{V_{\text{no\_load}}} \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Regulation} = \frac{(74.5 - 57)}{74.5} \times 100 = \frac{17.5}{74.5} \times 100 \approx 2.35\%
     \]
   - Rounding to the nearest option, the regulation is **2%**.
