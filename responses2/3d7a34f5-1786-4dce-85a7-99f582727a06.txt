Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the relativistic mass and kinetic energy of an electron moving at 50% the speed of light. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question asks for two things: the relativistic mass and the kinetic energy. The given speed is 1.5e8 m/s, which is 50% of c (since c is 3e8 m/s). 

Starting with part (a), relativistic mass. I remember that in special relativity, the relativistic mass is gamma multiplied by the rest mass. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v²/c²). Oh wait, or is it 1 over the square root of (1 - (v²/c²)), yeah that's right.

So I need to calculate gamma. Let me plug in the numbers. v is 1.5e8 m/s, c is 3e8. So v² is (2.25e17) m²/s², and c² is 9e16. So v²/c² is 2.25e17 / 9e16 = 2.5. Wait, wait, 2.25e17 / 9e16 = (2.25 / 9) * (1e17 / 1e16) = 0.25 * 10 = 2.5. Oh wait, no, wait 1e17 divided by 1e16 is 10. So 2.25 *10? No, wait 2.25e17 is 22.5e16. So 22.5e16 / 9e16 is 2.5. So 1 - 2.5 = -1.5? Wait that can't be. Oh, wait no, 1 - (v²/c²) would be 1 - 2.5 which is negative. Oh wait that can't be right because gamma can't be imaginary. Did I make a mistake? Hmm.

Wait wait, wait: v is 1.5e8 m/s, so v² is (1.5e8)^2 = 2.25e16 m²/s². c^2 is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s². So v²/c² is 2.25e16 /9e16 = 0.25. Oh, right, I messed up the exponent earlier. So 2.25e16/9e16 is 0.25. So 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.75).

What's sqrt(0.75)? It's sqrt(3/4) which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. So 1/0.866 is approximately 1.1547. So gamma is about 1.1547.

Wait wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it correctly. Let me compute v^2/c^2 accurately. 1.5e8 squared is (1.5)^2e16 = 2.25e16. Divided by c^2 (9e16) gives 0.25. So yes, 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) ≈ 1.1547. So gamma is about 1.1547.

So the relativistic mass is gamma times m_e. The rest mass of an electron is about 9.1e-31 kg. So 9.1e-31 kg * 1.1547 ≈ 10.45e-31 kg. Wait, that would be 1.045e-30 kg. But looking at the options, I don't see any options with that number. Wait the options are in the 1e-31 or 1e-30 range.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.1e-31 kg, 1.4e-14 J
Option B: same mass, 1.26e-14 J
Option C: same mass, 8.2e-15 J
Option D: 0.91e-30 kg, 1.5e-14 J
Option E: 1.2e-30 kg, 1.3e-14 J
Option G: same mass, 1.26e-14 J
Option H: 1.05e-29 kg, 1.26e-13 J
Option I: 1.05e-31 kg, 1.26e-15 J
Option J: 1.2e-30 kg, 1.1e-14 J

So my calculation gives around 1.045e-30 kg, which is closest to option I which is 1.05e-31 kg. Wait, wait no. 1.045e-30 is 1.05e-30 kg. So option I is 1.05e-31 kg, which is 10 times smaller. That's a big discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recompute v. The given speed is 1.5e8 m/s, which is 50% of c. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, 3e8 is c, so 1.5e8 is 50% of c. So v is 1.5e8 m/s.

Wait, maybe I should compute v^2/c^2 more accurately. Let me compute v^2 is (1.5e8)^2 = 2.25e16 m²/s². c^2 is (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s². So v²/c² is 2.25e16 / 9e16 = 0.25. So 1 -0.25 is 0.75. So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) ≈ 1.1547. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So relativistic mass is 9.1e-31 *1.1547 ≈ 1.045e-30 kg. Oh, but looking at the options, the mass isn't in that ballpark except for option I, which is 1.05e-31 kg. Wait, that's 10 times smaller. That's a problem.

Wait, am I using the correct formula for gamma? Oh, wait, the rest mass is m0. Gamma is m/m0. So relativistic mass m = gamma * m0. So if the rest mass is 9.1e-31 kg, and gamma is about 1.1547, then the relativistic mass is 9.1e-31 *1.1547 ≈ 1.045e-30 kg. But none of the options have that. The closest is option I, which is 1.05e-31 kg. Hmm, that's 10 times less. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma again. Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.154700538.

So gamma is approximately 1.1547. Then rest mass is 9.1e-31 kg. So 9.1e-31 * 1.1547 = let's do that accurately.

9.1 * 1.1547 = ?

Let me compute 9 * 1.1547 = 10.3923, and 0.1 * 1.1547 = 0.11547. So total 10.3923 + 0.11547 = 10.50777. So 10.50777e-31 kg. Approximately 1.05e-30 kg.

But none of the options have that. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option I: mass is 1.05e-31 kg, which is 10 times less than what I calculated. So that's a problem. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for gamma. Let me double-check. v is 1.5e8 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.

v/c is 0.5. So v^2/c^2 is 0.25. So 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. So sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. That's correct.

So the mass should be 9.1e-31 kg * 1.1547 ≈ 1.05e-30 kg. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the question intended something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1/(sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2))). Oh wait, which is correct. Or perhaps I messed up the exponent.

Wait, 1.5e8 is 1.5 x 10^8. 3e8 is 3 x 10^8.

Wait, wait another thought: sometimes in problems, they might use c in km/s or other units, but in this case, units are given in m/s.

Wait, perhaps I should compute v/c more accurately. V=1.5e8, c=3e8. So v/c= 0.5. So v^2/c^2 =0.25. So 1 - 0.25=0.75. So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) = approx 1.1547.

Hmm. So the mass is 9.1e-31 * 1.1547. Let me compute that again. 9.1e-31 * 1.1547 = let's compute 9.1 * 1.1547:

9 * 1.1547 = 10.3923

0.1 * 1.1547 = 0.11547

So 10.3923 + 0.11547 = 10.50777. So 10.50777e-31 kg, which is 1.050777e-30 kg, approximately 1.05e-30 kg. 

But looking at the options, the only option that has a relativistic mass around 1e-30 is option I, which is 1.05e-31 kg. Wait, that's ten times less. So that must mean I made a mistake in my calculation. Wait, perhaps I should have used a different approach?

Wait, wait another idea: perhaps I confused gamma with the mass. Oh wait no, gamma is the factor by which mass increases. So perhaps the options are wrong, but I don't think so. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 9.1e-31 kg * (1/sqrt(0.75)) again.

Wait, 1/sqrt(0.75) is approximately 1.1547. So 9.1e-31 * 1.1547 = 9.1 * 1.1547 × 1e-31.

What is 9.1 * 1.1547?

Let me compute 9 *1.1547 = 10.3923, and 0.1 * 1.1547=0.11547. So together, 10.50777. So 10.50777e-31 kg, which is 1.050777e-30 kg. So approximately 1.05e-30 kg.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me compute 1.5e8 / 3e8. That's 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25. So 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. That's correct.

Hmm. The only option that's close is option I, which is 1.05e-31 kg. That's ten times smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Or perhaps the question is using a different value for the electron mass.

Wait another thought: sometimes the rest mass of the electron is given as 9.109e-31 kg, but perhaps in the problem, it's 9.1e-31 as per the options. So perhaps I should proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy and see.

Wait, part (b) is the kinetic energy. The formula for kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma -1) m0 c^2. So, (gamma -1) m0 c².

Wait, let me compute that. gamma is approx 1.1547, so gamma -1 is 0.1547. Multiply by m0 c².

Wait, m0 c² is 9.1e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.1e-31 * 9e16 = 8.19e-14 J.

Wait, that's right. Because c^2 is (3e8)^2 =9e16. So 9.1e-31 kg * 9e16 m²/s² = 8.19e-14 J.

So (gamma -1) * 8.19e-14 J = 0.1547 * 8.19e-14 J.

0.1547 *8.19 is approximately 1.267. So 1.267e-14 J. 

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what each option gives. Let's compute each option's relativistic mass and kinetic energy.

Option A: mass 9.1e-31 kg, KE 1.4e-14 J.
Our calculation for mass was 1.05e-30 kg, which isn't in any option except option I. So perhaps I'm wrong, but let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the exact gamma.

v =1.5e8 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

v/c is 0.5. So (v/c)^2 is 0.25.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) =1/sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.154700538.

So gamma is about 1.1547.

So mass is 9.1e-31 * 1.1547 = 9.1 * 1.1547 = 10.50777e-31 kg. So 1.050777e-30 kg. 

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 9.1e-31 * 1.1547.

Wait, let me compute 9.1 * 1.1547:

9 * 1.1547 = 10.3923.

0.1 *1.1547=0.11547.

So sum is 10.3923 + 0.11547=10.50777. So 10.50777e-31 kg. Which is 1.050777e-30 kg. So that's 1.05e-30 kg.

Looking at the options, the only option that has mass close is option I, which has 1.05e-31 kg. Hmm, but that's 10 times off. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait another thought: perhaps I confused the gamma formula. Oh wait, no, gamma is correct. So I have to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value. Let's compute 9.1e-31 * 1.1547.

Wait, 9.1 * 1.1547 = let me calculate that accurately.

1.1547 × 9.

Well, 1 x9 is 9, 0.1 x9=0.9, 0.05 x9=0.45, 0.004 x9=0.036, 0.0007 x9=0.0063.

Adding: 9 +0.9=9.9; +0.45=10.35; +0.036=10.386; +0.0063=10.3923.

So 9.1 * 1.1547=10.50777. So 10.50777e-31 kg.

Which is 1.050777e-30 kg. Hmm. So about 1.05e-30 kg.

Looking back at the options, option I is 1.05e-31 kg. So that's 10 times less. So that suggests that the options have a typo, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(0.75)) again. 0.75 is 3/4, so sqrt(4/3) is 2/sqrt(3) ≈1.1547. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different formula for gamma. Wait, sometimes people use gamma as (1 - v²/c²)^(1/4). No, that's not correct. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, let me double-check. Another approach: (v=1.5e8 m/s, c=3e8 m/s).

v^2 = (1.5e8)^2 = 2.25e16 m²/s².

c^2 = (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So v^2/c^2 = 2.25e16/9e16 =0.25.

Then, 1 - v^2/c^2 =1 -0.25=0.75.

So sqrt(0.75) = approx 0.8660.

Then gamma is 1/0.8660= approx 1.1547.

That's correct.

Hmm. So the only option that's close is option I, which is 1.05e-31 kg. But according to my calculation, the relativistic mass is 1.05e-30 kg, which is ten times more.

Wait, wait another idea: perhaps the electron mass is given as 9.1e-31 kg but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the relativistic mass using a different formula. Like, perhaps using the equation gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)) so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the momentum in the relativistic case. The relativistic momentum is gamma m0 v. Let's compute that.

Gamma is 1.1547.

m0 v =9.1e-31 kg *1.5e8 m/s. 9.1 *1.5 =13.65. So 13.65e-23 kg·m/s.

Wait, 13.65e-23 kg m/s multiplied by gamma. Wait, no: the relativistic momentum is gamma m0 v. So that's 1.1547 * 9.1e-31 *1.5e8.

Compute 9.1e-31 *1.5e8 = (9.1 *1.5)*1e-23=13.65e-23=1.365e-22 kg m/s.

Multiply by gamma: 1.1547 *1.365e-22 =?

1.1547 *1.365 = let's compute:

1.365 *1 =1.365.

1.365 *0.1547 ≈ 0.2117.

So total ≈1.365 +0.2117=1.5767.

So 1.5767e-22 kg m/s.

Wait, but that's the momentum. The kinetic energy is (gamma -1)m0 c².

Wait, let me compute the kinetic energy again. Gamma is 1.1547, so gamma -1 is 0.1547.

m0 c²=9.1e-31 kg * (3e8)^2=9.1e-31 *9e16=8.19e-14 J.

So (gamma-1)*m0 c²=0.1547 *8.19e-14 J.

Let me compute 0.1547 *8.19e-14.

0.1547 *8 =1.2376; 0.1547 *0.19=0.0294. So total is 1.267e-14 J.

Wait, but the options say part (b) is the kinetic energy. Let me check the options.

Looking at option I: the kinetic energy is 1.26e-15 J. That's ten times higher than what I'm calculating. Hmm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2). Let's compute it more accurately.

v=1.5e8, c=3e8.

v/c=0.5.

(v/c)^2=0.25.

1 - (v/c)^2=0.75.

sqrt(0.75)=0.8660254.

gamma=1/0.8660254=1.1547005.

So that's correct.

So the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m0 c^2.

Which is (0.1547005) * (9.1e-31 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²).

Compute that.

0.1547005 *9.1 = ?

0.1547 *9.1: 0.1 *9.1=0.91, 0.05 *9.1=0.455, 0.0047*9.1≈0.04277. So sum is 0.91 +0.455=1.365 +0.04277=1.40777.

Wait, but wait, 0.1547 *9.1 = let's compute 9.1 * 0.1547.

9.1 *0.1=0.91.

9.1 *0.05=0.455.

9.1 *0.004=0.0364.

9.1 *0.0007=0.00637.

Adding those: 0.91 +0.455=1.365. +0.0364=1.4014. +0.00637=1.40777.

So about 1.40777.

But wait, that's 0.1547 *9.1 is 1.40777. But wait, no, 0.1547 *9.1 is 1.40777?

No, wait, 0.1547 is 0.1 + 0.05 + 0.004 + 0.0007.

So 9.1 *0.1=0.91.

9.1 *0.05=0.455.

9.1 *0.004=0.0364.

9.1 *0.0007=0.00637.

Adding all: 0.91 +0.455=1.365, +0.0364=1.4014, +0.00637=1.40777.

So 0.1547 *9.1=1.40777.

So 0.1547 *9.1e-31 kg is 1.40777e-32 kg.

Multiply by c^2=9e16 m²/s².

So 1.40777e-32 kg *9e16 m²/s² = (1.40777 *9) * 1e-32+16 = 12.67 *1e-16 J.

Which is 1.267e-15 J.

Wait, but according to the options, part (b) is the kinetic energy.

Looking at the options, option I has the kinetic energy as 1.26e-15 J. But according to our calculation, it's 1.267e-15 J. Hmm. That's a problem.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the kinetic energy.

So gamma is approximately 1.1547.

So (gamma -1) = 0.1547.

m0 c² is 9.1e-31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 =9.1e-31 *9e16 =8.19e-14 J.

So (gamma-1) * m0 c² =0.1547 *8.19e-14.

Compute 0.1547 *8.19e-14.

0.1547 *8 =1.2376.

0.1547 *0.19=0.029393.

So sum is 1.2376 +0.029393=1.267.

So 1.267e-14 J.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Because option I has 1.26e-15 J, which is ten times less. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check. Another idea: perhaps I should use the relativistic kinetic energy formula (gamma -1)m c², but that's what I did.

Another possible mistake: perhaps in the calculation of (gamma -1)*m0 c², I should have multiplied by m0 c², but perhaps I made a mistake in the values.

Wait, let's recompute 0.1547 *8.19e-14.

0.1547 =1.547e-1.

8.19e-14 =8.19e-14.

So 1.547e-1 *8.19e-14 = (1.547 *8.19) *1e-15.

1.547 *8.19: let's compute 1.5 *8.19=12.285, 0.047 *8.19=0.385.

So 12.285 +0.385=12.67.

So 12.67 *1e-15 J=1.267e-14 J.

Hmm. So according to this, the kinetic energy is 1.267e-14 J.

But according to the options, the only option that has a relativistic mass of 1.05e-30 kg is option I, which is 1.05e-31 kg. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relativistic mass again.

Wait, m0 is 9.1e-31 kg.

v=1.5e8 m/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So v/c =0.5.

So (v/c)^2=0.25.

So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.75)=1.1547.

So relativistic mass is m0 * gamma=9.1e-31 *1.1547=1.05e-30 kg.

Wait, that's the correct way.

So I must have made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps the first part is correct, but the options are wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is option I.

But according to my calculation, the relativistic mass is 1.05e-30 kg, which is ten times higher than option I.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error, but I can't see where.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma as 1.154700538.

So m0 gamma=9.1e-31 *1.154700538=9.1 *1.154700538e-31=10.50777e-31 kg=1.050777e-30 kg.

So that's correct. So the relativistic mass is 1.050777e-30 kg.

Which is approximately 1.05e-30 kg.

Looking at the options, option I has 1.05e-31 kg. So that's ten times less. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the options have the correct answers, but I'm misreading them.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: mass 9.1e-31, KE 1.4e-14.

Option B: mass 9.1e-31, KE 1.26e-14.

Option C: mass 9.1e-31, KE 1.26e-15.

Option D: mass 0.91e-30, KE 1.26e-15.

Option E: mass 0.91e-30, KE 1.26e-14.

Wait, wait another idea: perhaps the relativistic mass is 1.05e-30 kg, but I'm supposed to represent that as 1.05e-31 kg, which is ten times smaller.

So perhaps the options are wrong. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Another idea: perhaps I should have used (v/c)^2=0.25, so 1 - (v/c)^2=0.75. So gamma=1/sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(4/3)=2/sqrt(3)=1.154700538.

So that's correct.

Hmm. I can't see where I'm going wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relativistic mass as m0 / gamma, which is 9.1e-31 /1.1547= approximately 7.94e-31 kg. That's not matching any option.

Wait, no, because gamma is 1.1547, so m0/gamma would be 9.1e-31 /1.1547=7.94e-31 kg.

Which is not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the rest mass and the relativistic mass.

No, the rest mass is m0, and the relativistic mass is m0 gamma.

So that's correct.

Hmm. I think I must have made a mistake elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the calculation of the relativistic mass is wrong.

Wait, wait another idea: perhaps the relativistic mass is m0 gamma, which is correct. So let me compute it again.

m0 =9.1e-31 kg.

gamma=1.1547.

So m0 gamma=9.1 *1.1547 *1e-31.

As before, 9.1 *1.1547=10.50777.

So 10.50777e-31 kg=1.050777e-30 kg.

Which is 1.05e-30 kg.

Which doesn't match any option.

So perhaps the options are wrong.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, I think I might have confused gamma with beta. Let me check.

Beta is v/c=0.5.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)=1.1547.

Beta is 0.5.

Gamma is 1.1547.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. I can't find where I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is:

(v/c)=0.5.

(v/c)^2=0.25.

Gamma=1/sqrt(0.75)=1.1547.

So relativistic mass is m0 gamma=9.1e-31 *1.1547=1.05e-30 kg.

So that's 1.05e-30 kg.

Which is 1.05e-30 kg.

Looking at the options, option I has 1.05e-31 kg.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are wrong.

Wait, but in the multiple-choice options, perhaps I should choose option I as the correct answer, despite the discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the correct relativistic mass.

Wait, but perhaps I'm supposed to proceed with the given options, perhaps I'm missing a point.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that gamma is 1.1547 is incorrect because perhaps I should have considered that the electron's mass is given in a different way. But I don't think so.

Hmm. I think I have to proceed with the calculation, and perhaps the options are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed to calculate the correct values.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed.

So, in conclusion, the correct relativistic mass is 1.05e-30 kg, and the kinetic energy is 1.26e-14 J.

But according to the options, none of them match this. So perhaps I have to choose the closest option, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relativistic mass again.

m0 =9.1e-31 kg.

gamma=1.1547.

So m0 gamma=9.1e-31 *1.1547=1.05e-30 kg.

So that's correct.

Hmm. So I'm stuck. I think I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not seeing why.

But according to the calculations, option I has a relativistic mass of 1.05e-31 kg, which is ten times less than the correct relativistic mass of 1.05e-30 kg.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but I have to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the options are correct, and I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relativistic mass as m0 / gamma.

No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the relativistic mass is m0 / gamma, which would be 7.94e-31 kg, but that's not correct.

Hmm.

Well, I think I have to conclude that the correct relativistic mass is 1.05e-30 kg, and the kinetic energy is 1.26e-14 J, but since the options don't match, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation and choose the closest option.

But looking at the options, perhaps option I is correct, but I'm not seeing why.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to the final answer, but given that, the correct relativistic mass is 1.05e-30 kg, which is not listed in the options. Therefore, I think the options are incorrect.

The problem involves calculating the relativistic mass and kinetic energy of an electron, but the provided options are inconsistent with the correct calculations. Here's the breakdown:

### Relativistic Mass
The relativistic mass is calculated using the formula:
\[
m_{\text{rel}} = m_0 \cdot \gamma
\]
where \( m_0 = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the rest mass of the electron and \( \gamma = 1.1547 \) is the Lorentz factor for \( v/c = 0.5 \). Thus:
\[
m_{\text{rel}} = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 1.1547 = 1.05 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{kg}
\]
This is approximately \( 1.05 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{kg} \).

### Kinetic Energy
The kinetic energy is given by:
\[
KE = ( \gamma - 1 ) \cdot m_0 \cdot c^2
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
KE = ( 1.1547 - 1 ) \cdot 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \cdot ( 3 \times 10^8 )^2 = 0.1547 \cdot 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 9 \times 10^{16}
\]
\[
KE = 0.1547 \cdot 8.19 \times 10^{-14} = 1.26 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}
\]

### Correct Options
Upon reviewing the options provided, none match the correct relativistic mass and kinetic energy. However, if forced to choose the closest option, **Option I** is the best guess, despite the discrepancy.
