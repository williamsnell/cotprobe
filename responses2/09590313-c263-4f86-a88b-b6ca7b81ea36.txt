Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much the in-line skates will cost after a 10% discount. The original price is $110.99. Hmm, I need to calculate 10% of $110.99 and then subtract that from the original price. 

Wait, let me think. 10% is the same as multiplying by 0.10. So 10% of 110.99 would be 11.099. Oh wait, no, wait, 10% is easier because it's the same as dividing by 10. So 110.99 divided by 10 is 11.099. But since we're dealing with money, it makes sense to round to the nearest cent. So that's $11.10. 

Wait, no, wait, wait—wait, no, 10% is one-tenth, so yes, dividing by 10. So 110.99 ÷ 10 = 11.099, which is $11.0999, which rounds to $11.10. 

So the discount is $11.10. Now I subtract that from the original price. Let me do that calculation: $110.99 minus $11.10. So 110.99 minus 11 is 99.99, and then subtract another 0.10 to get 99.89. So the final price is $99.89. 

Looking at the options, option D is $99.89. So the answer should be D.

To calculate the discounted price, find 10% of $110.99, which is $11.099, rounded to $11.10. Subtract this from the original price: $110.99 - $11.10 = $99.89. The correct option is D.

Answer: D
