Okay, so I've got this question about the Ideal Moral Code theory. Hmm, I remember that moral codes are like guidelines that people follow to make right choices. The question is asking about what's required according to this theory. Let me think.

The options are labeled A through J. The question says that someone is obligated to do what the ideal moral rules would require. So the theory suggests that you have to follow the rules as they are set. 

Looking at the options, option H says it's in a world where moral rules are determined by a majority vote. Wait, but I'm not so sure about that. I thought that the theory was more about what's required in a situation where rules are enforced by institutions or are naturally formed. 

Option A talks about a constantly changing world, but I don't think that's the point. The theory about a world where rules are set might be more about what's required in a stable, institutionalized world. 

Option B says everyone complies perfectly. That's too idealistic. People can make mistakes, and rules are things people set, so they don't have to follow all of them perfectly. 

Option C suggests an ideal institutional setting. That makes sense because if you're in a world with good institutions, you're supposed to follow them. The theory is about following the rules that are naturally enforced.

Option D says every individual creates their own rules. That's not right; the rules come from institutions and societal norms, not individual creation.

Option E says institutions are corrupted. That's getting more complicated, but I don't think that's the point of the theory. The theory is about following what's required, not about the enforcement of the rules.

Option F is a world without institutions. That's probably not the case because without institutions, people can't follow them.

Option G says everyone complies imperfectly. Again, people don't have to follow rules perfectly, especially if the system is designed to enforce them.

Option I is a hypothetical society with perfect moral rules. That's a bit of a stretch. The theory is about what's required, not about whether the rules are perfect.

Option J is a hypothetical society with perfect rules. Hmm, but the question is about what's required, not what happens.

Wait, the question is about what is required according to the theory. The theory is about what's required in a situation where the rules are set. So the correct answer should be H, which is in a world where rules are determined by majority vote. Or wait, no. Maybe I was wrong earlier.

I think the ideal moral code theory is about what is required in the institutional setting, not about majority vote. So if I recall correctly, the theory says that you're obligated to follow the rules that are set by institutions. So option H is not correct because the rule is in a world where rules are determined by a majority vote, which is a type of enforcement, not the rules themselves.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The theory is about the obligations under the ideal moral code. So the person is obligated to follow the rules. So the correct answer should be the option that says "in your actual institutional setting," which is option H.

But wait, no. Another thought: Maybe the ideal code doesn't require you to follow the rules, but you have to follow what the rules say. So the theory says you do what the rules require. So in an institutional setting where rules are enforced, you follow them.

So the correct answer would be H, but I'm not so sure because I thought the ideal code refers to what's required without being enforced. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option H, as the theory suggests that the rules are in effect, but the person is to follow them. Or perhaps the question is about the actual setting where the rules are in place.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option H. The question is about what is required in the context of an ideal moral code, which is in a world where rules are determined by a majority vote. Or perhaps the ideal code is what the rules would require, regardless of enforcement.

No, I think the correct answer is option H. Because the theory is about the obligations under the ideal code, which requires following the rules set by institutions. So the person is obligated to follow the rules in their actual institutional setting.

But wait, I'm getting mixed up. Another way: the ideal moral code theory says that one is obligated to do what the ideal moral rules would require. So the person must follow the rules as they are in the world where the rules are set. So the correct answer would be the option that states that in the world where the rules are set. If option H is the world where rules are determined by majority vote, then the person is obligated to follow those rules. But that would mean the person is following the majority vote, which is a form of enforcement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H because the rules are in place, and the person must follow them. But I'm a bit shaky here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but that's a world without institutions, which isn't the case.

Wait, the question is about what is required according to the theory. The ideal code theory is about what's required, meaning what are the obligations. So the person is obligated to follow the rules that are set by the system. So in their actual institutional setting, the rules are in place, and the person must follow them. So the correct answer would be H: in a world where moral rules are determined by majority vote. But that seems a bit circular because the rule is in place.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the options again. The options are numbered A to J, each describes a scenario.

Option H says "in a world where moral rules are determined by majority vote." That's a bit confusing because the rules are already determined by the majority vote. So the person is required to comply, which is what the theory says.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H because the ideal code requires following the rules as they exist in the world. So the person is obligated to comply with the rules, which are determined by majority vote. So the answer is H.

According to the Ideal Moral Code theory, one is obligated to follow the moral rules as they are in place. The correct answer is the scenario where the rules are determined by a majority vote. This implies that the person must comply with the rules, which are already established. 

Answer: H
