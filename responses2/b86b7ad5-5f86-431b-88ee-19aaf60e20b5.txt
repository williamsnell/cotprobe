Question:

A plaintiff sued a department store for injuries she sustained when she slipped and fell in the store. At trial, the plaintiff proposes to testify that, when the store manager rushed to the scene, he said to the plaintiff, "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The store's attorney objects. How should the court rule on the admissibility of the store manager's testimony?

Options:

A: The testimony is inadmissible, because it is considered a hearsay exception for statements of personal or family history.
B: The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.
C: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
D: The testimony is admissible in its entirety as the statement of an opposing party.
E: The testimony is admissible in its entirety, because it is considered a party admission.
F: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because the manager's statement is in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses.
G: The testimony is admissible in its entirety as a res gestae statement.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because it violates the rule against hearsay, with no applicable exceptions.
I: The testimony about the water is inadmissible, but the statement about paying for the ambulance and hospital bill is admissible as an admission of guilt.
J: The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about whether a specific statement is admissible in court. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The case is about a plaintiff suing a department store for injuries after slipping in the store. The plaintiff is trying to testify about what happened. She says when the store manager rushed to the scene, he said, "I'm so sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." The store's attorney objects, and the question is whether the testimony is admissible.

So, the key here is understanding what kind of evidence is being presented. Let's look at the options and see which one makes sense.

Option A says the testimony is inadmissible because it's a hearsay exception for personal family history. Hmm, no, I don't think that's right. hearsay exceptions are based on specific circumstances, like when it's a statement of a party's knowledge, or a statement of fact, etc. The plaintiff is presenting a statement from the manager, but I don't think that's a hearsay issue because the statement is part of the transaction between the store and the plaintiff. It's more about the context of the conversation. So A might not be correct.

Option B suggests it's an opposing party statement but the rest is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses. Wait, no. The store's attorney is objecting, so I'm not sure if the store's attorney is pointing out that the offer is inadmissible. Also, the store's attorney might not be directly attacking the statement, just the plaintiff's. So perhaps B is not the right answer.

Option C claims it's inadmissible in its entirety because it's hearsay without exceptions. That makes sense because hearsay requires a declaration of a fact, and unless it's covered by an exception, it's not admissible. The statement about the water seems to be part of the transaction, so it's a statement of fact. Is there an exception here? I'm not sure, but I think statements about property damage might be exceptions. For example, if it's about the damage from slipping, maybe it's hearsay but has a hearsay exception for the property damage. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the statement was about the manager's words, that's a hearsay exception for the statement of a party's knowledge. But the statement is from the manager, not the plaintiff, so that exception might not apply. Or wait, is the statement of the manager a party's statement, so that falls under the statement of a party's knowledge? Because it's a statement that a third party (the store manager) was making. So if the store manager is the party, then the statement would be within a hearsay exception. But I think that's not right because the statement in question is about the plaintiff's injury, not about the manager's statement. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Option D says it's admissible in full as an opposing party statement. But again, I'm not sure if that's the case. The statement is about the water on the floor, not about the store's actions. So unless it's a hearsay exception, it's not admissible.

Option E says the testimony is admissible because it's a party admission. A party admission is used when someone is both the defendant and the plaintiff, but in this case, the store manager is a third party neither the defendant (plaintiff) nor the plaintiff herself. So I don't think that's applicable here. Unless the statement is part of an admission of guilt, but I'm not sure that's the right approach here.

Option F: The testimony is inadmissible because it's in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses. So the store manager says, "your hospital bill" — that sounds like they're offering compensation. So if the store attorney objects because the statement is about a medical expense, maybe the statement is an offer to pay, which is hearsay. So that would make it inadmissible. But I'm not certain. The statement is about the water on the floor, not about payment. Hmm.

Option G: It's admissible as a res gestae statement. Res geste is when a statement is made in the course of a transaction and is therefore admissible, but only if it's a statement of a party's knowledge or fact. I'm not sure if that applies here because the statement is about the water, which is a property damage. So perhaps it's hearsay without exceptions.

Option H: The testimony is inadmissible because it violates the rule against hearsay, with no exceptions. That's the general rule. If it's hearsay but without an exception, it's inadmissible. So if the statement is hearsay (water on the floor is a fact), and no exception applies, then it's inadmissible. But let's think about the context: could the statement about the water be a hearsay exception? For example, if it's about the manager's words or the store's action that caused the water, that might be an exception. Or if it's about the plaintiff's own injury, but I don't think so. So perhaps it's hearsay, and the store's attorney is objecting because it's hearsay. So the answer would be H.

Wait, another point: when is a statement considered a party admission? A party admission is when both parties are involved. But I don't think that's relevant here. The statement is about the water, not about the defendant's actions.

Alternatively, the statement could be part of an offer to pay, which is hearsay. So the statement about paying for the hospital bill is hearsay, making the entire statement inadmissible. But in that case, the store would have to object because it's in the context of an offer to pay. So for option F, the statement is about an offer, so it's hearsay and thus inadmissible.

Wait, but the statement is about the water on the floor, not about the hospital bill. So the statement about the hospital bill is a separate fact. So the store's statement about the hospital bill is hearsay, making the entire statement inadmissible. But the store's attorney might object for that part. So the entire statement is inadmissible because it's hearsay without exceptions.

Alternatively, if the statement about the water is hearsay, then the entire testimony is inadmissible.

So looking back at the options, options B and F are about the store's statement being inadmissible. Let me think about the reasoning.

The store's statement is part of a conversation where the manager said, "I'm sorry about the water on the floor there, but don't worry the store will pay for the ambulance and your hospital bill." So the statement is not about the defendant's actions but about the plaintiff's injury. So perhaps the entire statement is hearsay because it's a statement of a fact (water on the floor) without any exception.

So the reasoning would be that the statement is hearsay and lacks an exception. Thus, it's inadmissible. So H is correct.

Wait, but option F says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay. If the statement is about the water on the floor, but that's not a party or defendant's statement, then it's hearsay. So the answer would be H: the testimony is inadmissible in its entirety because it's hearsay without any exceptions.
</think>

The plaintiff is presenting a statement about the water on the floor at the department store, which is hearsay because it is a statement of a fact without an exception. This statement is part of a conversation in which the store manager made it. Since the statement lacks a hearsay exception (e.g., statement of a party's knowledge or fact), it is inadmissible as hearsay. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: H
