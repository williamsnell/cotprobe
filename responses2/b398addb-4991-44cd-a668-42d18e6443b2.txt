The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians."

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about how the treatment of the Native Americans in the New World differs from English practices. The excerpt provided talks about the Spanish, mestizos, and Indians being treated harshly in the mines of Huancavelica and Potosi. They were paid labor, which was a violation of the English system. Instead, they were forced to work in mines where they paid little, and their work was hidden. Also, the owners kept them as cooking women and forced their use of corn or meat, deducting the cost. The English couldn't stop the colonists from exploiting the natives.

So the question is asking which options differ between the English treatment and the native treatment. The options are A to J, each describing a different aspect.

Looking at each option:

A: "Widely did not condone intermingling with the natives." Hmm, the story mentions that the Europeans treated the natives harshly, not condoning them. So this would be true. But the question is about the difference, so the answer isn't directly A unless it's the opposite.

B: "Immediately granted the natives citizenship rights." No, the text says that the Europeans didn't even grant citizenship. They treated the natives harshly, so this is false.

C: "Viewed the natives as true equals as they settled the Americas." The text says they were treated as equals, but the Spanish and others were treated harshly, not equal. So this is false.

D: "Did not allow the natives to live in the territories they conquered." Wait, the text says the natives were forced to live in mines where they were not allowed to work their labor. So the English allowed them to live but didn't let them work. So D says they didn't allow living, which seems incorrect. Because the text says they were forced to work, not to live, so D is false.

E: "Did not use the natives for any labor." The text says they were paid labor, so E is false.

F: "Forced the natives to convert to Christianity." No, the text doesn't mention any conversion. The main issue was exploitation, not religious conversion.

G: "Used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops." The text says they were forced to work in mines, which included cash crops, but they were paid little. So G is false.

H: "Used the natives exclusively for harvesting cash crops, like tobacco and cotton." Again, the text says they were paid little and were used for cash crops, but not exclusively. So H is false.

I: "Were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership." The text mentions a lack of land ownership, so this is correct.

J: "Forced the natives to pay tribute in gold and precious stones." The text says they were forced to accept corn, meat, or chicha, but not to pay tribute. So J is false.

So the correct answer must be I. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are listed from A to J. The correct answer is I, which is "Were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership." Because the text says the Europeans didn't understand the natives' lack of land, which is a point of difference.

The correct answer is **I: Were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership**. The text describes how the Spanish, mestizos, and Indians were treated as equals but were forced to work in mines where they were not paid and their labor was hidden. The Europeans' confusion about the lack of land ownership contrasts with this aspect. 

Answer: I
