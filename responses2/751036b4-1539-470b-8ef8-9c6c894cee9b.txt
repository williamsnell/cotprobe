Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about a monopolist. Hmm, I remember that monopolists maximize profit by setting marginal cost equal to marginal revenue. Let's try to break this down.

The firm has constant average and marginal costs (AC=MC=10). So the average cost is 10, and the marginal cost is also 10. That's good to know because it might simplify things.

The demand curve is given as Q = 60 - P. Wait, that's the inverse demand curve, right? So if I solve for P, it's P = 60 - Q. So price depends on quantity.

To find the profit-maximizing quantity, I need to find where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). But wait, how do I get MR from the demand curve?

I remember that for a monopolist, MR is less than the price by the slope of the demand curve. The demand curve is linear, so the slope is -1. The formula for MR is (P*(Q + 1))/(Q) ? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the derivative of the total revenue.

Total revenue (TR) is P times Q. Since P is 60 - Q, TR = (60 - Q)*Q = 60Q - QÂ². The derivative of TR with respect to Q is MR. So d(TR)/dQ = 60 - 2Q. So MR = 60 - 2Q.

Set MR equal to MC since that's where the profit is maximized. MC is 10. So 60 - 2Q = 10. Let's solve for Q.

60 - 10 = 2Q => 50 = 2Q => Q = 25. So the profit-maximizing quantity is 25.

Now, to find the price, plug Q into the inverse demand equation. P = 60 - Q = 60 -25 =35.

Wait, looking at the options, 35 is option H. So I think the correct answer is H.

To determine the profit-maximizing price, we start by finding the marginal revenue (MR) from the demand curve. Given the demand function \( Q = 60 - P \), the inverse demand function is \( P = 60 - Q \). Total revenue (\( TR \)) is \( P \times Q = (60 - Q) \times Q = 60Q - Q^2 \). Taking the derivative of \( TR \) with respect to \( Q \) gives the marginal revenue:

\[
MR = \frac{d(TR)}{dQ} = 60 - 2Q
\]

At profit maximization, \( MR = MC \). Given \( MC = 10 \), we solve:

\[
60 - 2Q = 10 \implies 2Q = 50 \implies Q = 25
\]

Substituting \( Q = 25 \) back into the inverse demand function:

\[
P = 60 - 25 = 35
\]

Thus, the profit-maximizing price is **35**, which corresponds to option **H**.
