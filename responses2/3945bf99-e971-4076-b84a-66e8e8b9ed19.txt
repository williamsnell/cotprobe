Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about disjunctive syllogisms, and I need to figure it out. Let me think about what I remember from logic classes. Disjunctive syllogisms are a type of argument in propositional logic, right? They have a structure where there are two premises and a conclusion, and the conclusion is a disjunction, which is an "or" statement.

Wait, the question is about the characteristics of a valid disjunctive syllogism. The options are A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should recall the structure of a disjunctive syllogism. A standard form is: 

1. Either P or Q (this is the major premise)
2. Not Q (this is the minor premise)
3. Therefore, P (the conclusion).

Or sometimes the premises are stated differently, like:

Premise 1: P ∨ Q
Premise 2: ¬Q
Conclusion: P

So, in this structure, the major premise is a disjunction, and the minor premise is a negation of one of the disjuncts, leading to the conclusion that the other part must be true.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative. Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. The minor premise is the one that says ¬Q, so it's rejecting the alternative (Q). So, the minor premise doesn't "accept" or "reject" the alternative; it outright denies the alternative. So option A might be incorrect.

Option B: One of the premises is missing. Hmm, that's not correct because a valid disjunctive syllogism has both premises provided. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: The major premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. Wait, the major premise is a disjunction (P ∨ Q). Let me think, in modus tollens or modus ponens, the premises are about the antecedents and consequents. But in a disjunctive syllogism, the major premise is a disjunction, not a conditional. So I don't think C is correct.

Option D: It includes a conjunction in the major premise. A conjunction would be something like P ∧ Q, which is not part of the disjunctive syllogism. So D is incorrect.

Option E: It reaches a contradictory conclusion. Wait, no. A contradictory conclusion would imply that P and not P are both true, which isn't the case in a syllogism. So E is wrong.

Option F: It includes a hypothetical premise. Disjunctive syllogisms don't involve hypothetical statements (like P → Q). So F is incorrect.

Option G: The major premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative. Wait, that's about the major premise. Earlier, I thought the major premise is a disjunction, so it's about P or Q, not about any alternative. So G might not be correct.

Option H: The minor premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. Hmm, the minor premise is ¬Q, which means denying the consequent. So if the major premise is P ∨ Q, and the minor premise is ¬Q, then the conclusion is P. So the minor premise was supposed to deny the consequent (Q), which is correct. So H seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check. In the structure, the minor premise is ¬Q, so it's denying the consequent. So the minor premise must either affirm or deny the consequent. So H says "must either affirm or deny the consequent," which is correct. So H is correct.

Option I: The minor premise must either accept a conjunction or reject a conjunction. That doesn't make sense. The minor premise is a negation of one part, not a conjunction.

Option J: It reaches a truthful conclusion. Well, the syllogism is valid if it follows correctly, so the conclusion is truthful. But the question is about the characteristics—like what must be true. So J could be correct, but it's not a defining feature of the structure.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The correct answer is H: The minor premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent.

**Answer: H**
