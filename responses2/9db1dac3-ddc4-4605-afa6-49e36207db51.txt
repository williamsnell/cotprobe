Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Five years ago, a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money. The question is asking about the speed to price ratio of the current computer compared to the older one. Hmm, ratios, okay.

Let me break it down. Let's define some variables to make it clearer. Let me call the current computer's speed S. So, five years ago, the old computer's speed would be half of S, which is S/2.

Now, about the cost. Five years ago, the older computer cost twice as much as the current one. Wait, no, the way it's phrased is a bit tricky. Let me read again: "a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money." So, five years ago, the older computer was half the speed of the current one, but it cost twice as much. So the older computer's cost was higher.

Let me denote the current computer's cost as C. So five years ago, the older computer's cost would be 2C.

But wait, the older computer cost twice as much as the current computer. Wait, no, that's not correct because it's five years ago. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of present values. Five years ago, the current computer's price was C, and the older computer's price was 2C. Because five years ago, the older computer cost twice as much as the current one. So, the older computer's price was 2C five years ago, but the current computer's price is C now.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me make it clearer. Let me set up variables.

Let me denote:

- Current computer speed: S (units per year)
- Current computer's cost: C
- Older computer speed: S/2 (because it worked half as fast)
- Older computer's cost: 2C (because five years ago, it cost twice as much as the current computer)

Wait, no. Wait, the wording is: "Five years ago, a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money." So, five years ago, the older computer's cost was twice the current computer's cost. Because five years ago, the older computer cost twice as much as the current one now.

So, in terms of variables:

- Current computer's speed: S
- Older computer's speed: S/2
- Current computer's cost: C
- Older computer's cost: 2C (five years ago, older cost twice as much as current)

But wait, that's not correct because five years ago, the older computer's cost was 2C, but the current one's cost is C. So, in the past, older computer's cost was 2C, but that's five years ago. So, the older computer's current cost is higher than the current computer's. Because if five years ago, the older computer was cheaper than the current one, but now it's twice as expensive.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me clarify:

Let me denote:

- Let the current computer's price be C.
- Five years ago, the older computer's price was 2C (because it cost twice as much as the current computer now).

So, the older computer's cost five years ago was 2C, but its current cost is higher. Oh wait no, five years ago, the older computer's cost was 2C. But that would mean the older computer is now 2C / 2 = C? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, no, five years ago, the older computer's cost was twice as much as the current computer's cost. So, older computer's cost five years ago: 2C. Current computer's cost now: C.

But we need their current prices. So, older computer's current price is older_price = 2C.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because five years ago, the older computer's price was 2C, but that would make it more expensive than the current computer. But that seems contradictory. Because if the older computer was twice as fast, perhaps it should be more expensive if it's cheaper? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the variables mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should consider that five years ago, the older computer's price was 2 times the current computer's price. So, older_price_5_years_ago = 2 * current_price.

But older_price_5_years_ago would also be older_price now + 5 years of depreciation. Wait, but I don't have information about depreciation. Hmm, this approach might not be the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the current speeds and costs. Let me try to set up the equations correctly.

Let me denote:

Let S be the current speed of the computer.
Let C be the current cost of the computer.

Five years ago, the older computer's speed was S/2, and its cost was 2C.

So, older computer in 5 years: speed S/2, cost 2C.

But I need to find the ratio of the current computer's speed to the older computer's speed, and the current computer's cost to the older computer's cost, but wait no, the question is about the speed to price ratio, not the current speed relative to older speed.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as: "The current computer's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio?"

So, (Speed of current / Speed of older) * 100% compared to (Price of current / Price of older).

Wait, no, the question is: what percent is the current computer's speed to its price ratio compared to the older computer's speed to price ratio. So, (Speed_current / Price_current) / (Speed_older / Price_older) *100%.

Wait, let me write it as:

Speed_ratio_current = S / C
Speed_ratio_older = (S/2) / (2C) = (S/2)/(2C) = (S) / (4C)

So, Speed_ratio_current / Speed_ratio_older = (S/C) / (S/(4C)) ) = (S/C) * (4C/S) )= 4.

Wait, that would be 4 times. So, 4 times as much? But that's 400%, but the options don't have 400, but option E is 100% and option J is 300%. Wait, but the options don't have 400. So, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again.

Speed ratio for current computer: S / C.

Speed ratio for older computer: (S/2) / (2C) = (S/2) / (2C) = S/(4C).

So, the ratio of current's speed ratio to older's speed ratio is (S/C) / (S/(4C)) = (S/C)*(4C/S) )= 4.

So, 4 times as much. So 400% of the older's speed ratio. So, the current's speed ratio is 4 times higher than the older's.

But the question is asking: the current's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older's speed to price ratio? So (Speed_current / Price_current) is what percent of (Speed_older / Price_older).

Wait, no, the question is phrased as: "the current computer's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio?" So, (Speed_current / Price_current) = x% of (Speed_older / Price_older).

Wait, no, it's (Speed_current / Price_current) is x% of (Speed_older / Price_older). So, (S/C) = x% * ( (S/2) / (2C) )

Wait, that would be:

(S/C) = x% * ( (S/2) / (2C) )

Simplify the right side: (S/2) / (2C) = S/(4C).

So, S/C = x% * (S/(4C)).

Divide both sides by S/(4C):

(S/C) / (S/(4C)) = x% → 4 = x%.

Wait, that's 4 times as much. So, 400% of the older's ratio.

But the options don't have 400. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 20
B: 500
C: 200
D: 50
E: 100
F: 2/5
G: 1/2
H: 1/2
I: 100
J: 300.

So, 400 is not an option. Hmm, that's an issue. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.

The question is: "The current computer's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio?"

Wait, no, the ratio is (Speed_current / Price_current) compared to (Speed_older / Price_older). So, (S/C) is what percent of ( (S/2) / (2C) ) = S/(4C).

So, (S/C) = x% * ( S/(4C) )

Multiply both sides by (4C/S):

4 = x% *1 → x% =4 → 400%.

But again, 400 isn't an option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in variables.

Wait, perhaps I should define the ratio as (Speed_current / Price_current) divided by (Speed_older / Price_older), which is the same as (Speed_current/Price_current) * (Price_older / Speed_older).

Let me compute that.

Speed_current = S, Price_current = C.

Speed_older = S/2, Price_older=2C.

So, (S/C) / ( (S/2) / (2C) ) )= (S/C) / (S/(4C)) = (S/C) * (4C/S) )= 4.

Again, 4, which is 400% of the older ratio. But 400 is not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, let me double-check the problem statement.

The problem says: Five years ago, the computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money. So, five years ago, older computer cost twice as much as current computer now.

Wait, that's the key point. So, five years ago, older computer cost twice as much as current computer now.

Wait, that's important. So, current computer's cost is C, five years ago, older computer's cost was 2C.

But older computer's cost five years ago is also equal to older computer's current cost minus the depreciation over five years. But I don't have any information about depreciation rates or time value of money. So, perhaps I should assume that the prices are changing over time due to depreciation. But without any info on that, maybe we can't model it. Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple scenario where the prices are just moving forward in time, so older computer's current cost is (older computer's cost five years ago) + (depreciation over 5 years), but without info, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is just about the ratios, not considering the time value. So maybe the older computer's current cost is 2C, and its speed is S/2.

Wait, but wait, the current computer's cost has not changed in the problem, only the older computer's cost was 2C five years ago. So, if I'm to find the current prices, the older computer's current price would have been higher than 2C, but I don't have info on that.

This is getting confusing. Let me try again.

Let me define:

Current computer: Speed S, Cost C.

Older computer: Speed S/2, Cost C_old_now.

Five years ago, older computer's cost was 2C.

Wait, that's impossible because five years ago, older computer's cost was 2C, but the current computer's cost is C.

So, older computer in 5 years: C_old = (current cost) + depreciation over 5 years.

But without knowing depreciation rate, I can't model it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the older computer's cost five years ago was 2C, and that's the same as its current cost. But that doesn't make sense because then older computer would be more expensive now, but the problem says the older computer's cost was 2C five years ago, which is more than current cost. 

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it with the given information.

The problem says:

Five years ago, older computer's speed was S/2, and its cost was 2C.

So, older computer's speed now is (S/2) + (depreciation over 5 years). But again, without knowing the depreciation rate, I can't find the current price. So perhaps the problem doesn't consider depreciation and just uses the current cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the older computer's current cost is C, and five years ago, its cost was 2C, implying that it's more expensive. But that would mean the older computer's current cost is (current cost) + (depreciation). But without knowing the rate, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the current computer's speed is S, current cost C.

Older computer's speed is S/2, and older computer's cost five years ago was 2C. So, the older computer's current cost would have been higher than 2C, but I don't have info on that.

This is getting me stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the ratios.

Let me consider the current speeds and prices, and then the older computer's current prices.

So:

Older computer's speed now: S/2.

Older computer's cost now: Let's denote it as C_older_current.

Five years ago, older computer's cost was 2C.

The difference between older's current cost and five years ago is the depreciation over 5 years. So, C_older_current - 2C = depreciation.

But without knowing the depreciation rate, I can't find C_older_current. So, perhaps the problem is designed so that we don't need to consider the depreciation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio as something else. Let me try to model it.

Let me denote:

Current computer: S, C.

Older computer: S/2, C_older.

Five years ago, older computer's cost was 2C.

So, older computer's current cost would be C_older = C_older_5_years_ago + depreciation.

But without knowing the depreciation, perhaps the problem is assuming that the older computer's current cost is 2C, and it's been depreciating by some amount, but that's not given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified and we can ignore the depreciation, meaning the older computer's current cost is 2C, but the current computer's cost is C. But that doesn't make sense because the current computer's cost is C, and the older computer's cost now is 2C, which would mean the older computer is more expensive now, but that's not reflected in the problem's information.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try to model the problem using variables, assuming that the older computer's current cost is 2C.

So, older computer's current cost is 2C.

Older computer's speed is S/2.

Current computer's speed is S.

Current computer's cost is C.

Wait, but the problem says that five years ago, older computer's cost was 2C. So, five years ago, the older computer's cost was 2C, which was five years ago from now.

So, older computer's current cost is 2C + depreciation over five years.

But without knowing the depreciation rate, I can't find the current cost. So, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore depreciation, and just assign the current cost as 2C, but that would mean the current computer's cost is C, and older's is 2C, which is more expensive now. But the problem says that the older computer's cost was 2C five years ago, which is more expensive than the current computer's cost C.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the older computer was 2C five years ago, and its current cost is 2C, that would mean the older computer is not more expensive now. But the problem says that the older computer's cost was twice as much as the current computer's now, which would be higher than C.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the expressions. Let me read the problem statement again:

"Five years ago, a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer cost twice as much money."

So, five years ago, older computer's cost was twice the current computer's cost now.

So, years ago: older_cost_5_years_ago = 2 * current_cost_now.

So, older_cost_5_years_ago = 2C.

And older's current cost would be older_cost_5_years_ago plus any depreciation, but without knowing the rate, perhaps the problem treats it as being 2C now, but that contradicts the statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the older computer's current cost is 2C, but that's not reflected in the problem's information.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, even if it leads to a number not matching the options.

So, current computer's speed is S, current cost is C.

Older computer's speed is S/2, current cost is 2C.

So, the speed ratios:

Current speed: S/C.

Older speed: (S/2)/(2C) = S/(4C).

So, speed ratio of current/(older) is (S/C)/(S/(4C)) =4.

So, the current's speed ratio is 4 times the older's.

So, the speed ratio of current is 4 times the older's.

But the question is about speed to price ratio.

Current speed to price ratio: S / C.

Older's speed to price ratio: (S/2) / (2C) = S/(4C).

So, the ratio of current's speed to price ratio compared to older's is:

(S/C) / (S/(4C)) = 4.

So, 4 times the older's ratio.

4 times 100% is 400%, but that's not an option. The options include 100% (option I) and 300% (J), but not 400.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let's try again.

Alternative approach:

Let me denote that the older computer's current cost is 2C (twice as much as the current computer's cost now).

But wait, the older computer's cost five years ago was 2C, and five years ago, its current cost would have been higher by the depreciation.

But without knowing the depreciation rate, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore depreciation and just assign the current cost as 2C.

So, older computer's current cost is 2C.

But the problem states that five years ago, older computer's cost was 2C, which is more than current computer's cost now.

So, perhaps the years ago is a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the time value and just model it purely with the given ratios.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem without considering the time value, so the older computer's current cost is 2C.

So, speeds are S and S/2.

Speed ratios:

Current speed / Current price = S / C.

Older speed / Older price = (S/2) / (2C) = S/(4C).

So, current's speed ratio is 4 times the older's.

But the options don't have 400. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of (speed / price) ratio, not (speed / price) as a ratio. Wait, the question is: "the current computer's speed to price ratio is what percent of the older computer's speed to price ratio?"

So, it's (speed_current / price_current) divided by (speed_older / price_older) = (speed_current * price_older) / (speed_older * price_current).

Which is (S * (2C)) / ( (S/2) * (2C) ) = (2SC) / (SC) )= 2.

So, 2 times. That would be 200% of the older's ratio. Which is option C.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think.

If I consider (speed_current / price_current) / (speed_older / price_older) = (speed_current / price_current) * (price_older / speed_older).

So, (S/C) * (2C/(S/2)) )= (S/C) * (2C * 2/S) )= (S/C) * (4C/S) )= 4.

Hmm, same as before, 4 times.

But if I do (speed_current * price_older) / (speed_older * price_current) )= (S/(C)) * (2C/(S/2)) )= same as before, 4.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for (speed_current / price_current) / (speed_older / price_older) )= (S/C)/( (S/2)/(2C) )= (S/C) * (2C/(S/2)) )= (S/C) * (4C/S) )= 4.

So, 4 times, which is 400%, but that's not an option.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option I is 100, option J is 300. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the older computer's speed is S/2, and its current cost is 2C.

Wait, but then the older computer's speed is S/2, and its current cost is 2C. So, older's speed to price ratio is (S/2)/(2C) )= S/(4C).

Current's speed to price ratio is S/C.

So, (S/C) / (S/(4C)) )= (S/C) * (4C/S) )=4.

Which is 400%, but that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the options given. The options are: A:20, B:500, C:200, D:50, E:100, F:2/5, G:1/2, H:1/2, I:100, J:300.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the speed to price ratio.

Wait, let me approach it differently.

Suppose the current computer's speed is S, and cost is C.

Older computer's speed is S/2, but its cost is 2C.

But that would mean the older computer is more expensive now, which contradicts the problem statement that says the older computer cost 2C five years ago.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the older computer's current cost is 2C, but that's not reflected in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the older computer's current cost is 2C, but it's not reflected in the problem's information.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me try to think in terms of speed and price ratios.

The speed ratio is speed_current / speed_older.

The price ratio is price_current / price_older.

We need to find (speed_current / speed_older) / (price_current / price_older) ) *100%.

So, (speed_current / speed_older) * (price_older / price_current) *100%.

Let me compute each part.

speed_current / speed_older = S / (S/2) )=2.

price_current / price_older = C / (2C )=0.5.

So, 2 * 0.5 =1, 1*100% =100%.

So, the answer would be 100%, which is option I.

Wait, that makes sense! Because the speed ratio is 2, and the price ratio is 0.5, their ratio is 1, so 100%.

Ah, that's the correct approach. I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering the correct price ratio.

So, the correct approach is to compute the ratio of speed to price as (speed_current / speed_older) * (price_older / price_current) ) *100%.

Which is (S/(S/2)) * (2C/C) ) *100% = 2 * 2 ) *100% =400%? Wait, no.

Wait, no: (S/(S/2)) is 2, (2C/C) is 2. So, 2*2=4. Then, 4*100% =400%.

But wait, that's not matching my earlier calculation. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recheck:

speed_current / speed_older = S / (S/2) )= 2.

price_current / price_older = C / (2C) )= 0.5.

So, (speed_current / speed_older) * (price_older / price_current) )= 2 * 0.5 =1.

Multiply by 100% gives 100%.

So, the answer is 100%, which is option I.

Ah, that's the correct approach. I think I was mistaken earlier, but this makes sense now.

So, the correct answer is I:100.
</think>

The problem requires calculating the ratio of the speed to price for both the current and older computers. The older computer's speed is half of the current computer's, and its cost is twice as high as the current computer's. By computing the speed and price ratios, the ratio of these ratios is found to be 100%.

ANSWER: I
