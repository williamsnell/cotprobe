Okay, I'm trying to solve this statistics problem where I need to find the Z-scores for given raw scores. Let me think this through step by step.

So, the problem says that a random variable X is normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 118 and a standard deviation (σ) of 11. I need to find the Z-scores for raw scores of 115, 134, and 99. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

I remember that the formula for the Z-score is Z = (X - μ) / σ. So, each raw score will be plugged into this formula to get the corresponding Z-score.

Let me compute each one.

First, the raw score of 115. Plugging into the formula: (115 - 118) / 11. That's (-3) divided by 11. Hmm, let me calculate that. 3 divided by 11 is about 0.27, so the negative would be -0.27. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Oh wait, 115 is below the mean, so the Z-score should be negative. So I think that's right.

Next, the raw score of 134. Applying the formula: (134 - 118) / 11. That's 16 divided by 11. Let me do the division. 11 goes into 16 once, with 5 remainder. So 16/11 is approximately 1.4545. So that's about 1.45. Positive because 134 is above the mean.

Then, the raw score of 99. So, (99 - 118) is -19. Divided by 11. That's -1.727. So approximately -1.73. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. 19 divided by 11 is roughly 1.727, so negative is -1.73. That's right.

Now, let me look at the options. Each option lists three Z-scores, so I'll need to see which option has the first being -0.27, second 1.45, and third -1.73.

Looking at option F: -.27, 1.45, -1.73. That matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let me check another option to make sure. Option B is -.27, -1.45, -1.73. Oh, that's the opposite of what I just calculated. So that's wrong. Option E is .27, 1.45, 1.73. No, those are positive, but I know 99 is below the mean, so Z should be negative. So E is incorrect. Option G has -1, 2, -2, which doesn't match my numbers. Option H is -0.5, 1.2, -1.5. No, not matching. Option I is .27, -1.45, .73. No, again the signs don't match. Option J has 2.73, -0.27, 0.45. Doesn't look right. Option C is -2.18, 0.15, -1.82. That's way off. Option D is 0, 1.5, -2. No. Option A is -.27, 1.45, 1.73. Wait, I thought 99 gave -1.73, but option A's third number is 1.73, which is positive. So no. So F is the only one that matches all three Z-scores I calculated.

To find the Z-scores for the given raw scores, we use the formula:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

where \( \mu = 118 \) and \( \sigma = 11 \).

1. For raw score \( X = 115 \):
\[
Z = \frac{115 - 118}{11} = \frac{-3}{11} \approx -0.27
\]

2. For raw score \( X = 134 \):
\[
Z = \frac{134 - 118}{11} = \frac{16}{11} \approx 1.45
\]

3. For raw score \( X = 99 \):
\[
Z = \frac{99 - 118}{11} = \frac{-19}{11} \approx -1.73
\]

The calculated Z-scores are approximately \(-0.27\), \(1.45\), and \(-1.73\), which matches option F.

**Answer: F**
