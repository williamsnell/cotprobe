Okay, so I've got this question about a legal scenario, specifically about what happens when an attorney serves interrogatories in a federal district court. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question: The attorney served summons, complaint, and 25 interrogatories. The interrogatories said they were to be answered within 30 days. The question is about which ground the defendant is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that in federal court, when a party is served with interrogatories, they must be served within a certain timeframe. I think the time limit is usually 30 days from the date the summons was served. So, if the summons was given, and the 25 interrogatories were served within that 30-day window, that's the rule.

Now, looking at the options. Option E says the defendant is not required to respond to the interrogatories within 30 days. Wait, that sounds familiar. I remember that generally, parties aren't required to respond within the 30-day period. So if the defendant doesn't respond, the court might proceed with an investigation. But if the defendant does respond, then the court can revoke the protective order or grant a judgment.

But the question is about what the defendant is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order. So, the key point here is whether the party has to respond within the 30 days. I think the general rule is that parties have a 30-day window to respond. If they do, the court can revoke the protective order or grant judgment. If they don't, the court can proceed with an investigation.

So looking back at the options, option E says the defendant isn't required to respond within 30 days. That seems correct based on what I recall. So the defendant is likely to be served and, if they don't respond within time, the court may proceed without a protective order.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another point: the initial serving. The 25 interrogatories must be served no later than 30 days after the summons was served. If the defendant doesn't respond within 30 days, the court can interfere. So the defendant is not bound to respond then, and the court might find that their interest isn't protected. So the correct answer is likely E.

Other options: Option D says the interrogatories may not be served without permission from the court or an agreement. That's about the procedure, but the question is about the consequences once served. The question is about the grounds for a protective order, not whether the serving was done properly.

Options like G, H, F, I, J are about the content of the interrogatories. The question is about the ground for the order, not the questions themselves. So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is E: The interrogatories are not required to respond to within a 30-day period from the date the summons was served. This is because federal courts generally do not require parties to respond to interrogatories within the specified timeframe. If the defendant fails to respond, the court may proceed with an investigation without a protective order.

**Answer: E**
