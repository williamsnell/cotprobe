Okay, so I've got this logic problem here that I need to solve. It's about determining if a set of propositions is consistent using an indirect truth table. Hmm, let's see. The propositions are:

1. ~N ≡ (O · P)
2. ~O ⊃ Q
3. N · ~Q

And I have to choose which option among A to H is correct. The options talk about whether the set is consistent or not and what the consistent valuations are. Right, so first, I need to figure out if there's any combination of truth values for N, O, P, Q that makes all three propositions true at the same time. If such a combination exists, the set is consistent; otherwise, it's inconsistent.

I remember that in an indirect truth table, you assume that the set is consistent, which means there exists at least one row where all propositions are true. Then, you derive a contradiction to show that no such row exists. Alternatively, if you can find a row where all propositions are true, then the set is consistent.

Wait, but the question says to use an indirect truth table, so I think that means I should assume the set is consistent and try to find a contradiction. If that leads to a contradiction, then the set is inconsistent. But wait, the problem is about determining consistency, so maybe the approach is directly checking for possible valuations without assuming consistency.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Indirect truth tables are used to show that a set of formulas is inconsistent, by deriving a contradiction. So, for consistency, the set is consistent if there's at least one row where all formulas are true.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to assign truth values to N, O, P, Q and see if any combination satisfies all three propositions.

Let me list the propositions again:

1. ~N ≡ (O · P) → which is equivalent to (N → ~O) ∧ (N → ~P), no, wait, wait. Wait, ~N ≡ (O · P) is the same as ~N ↔ (O ∧ P). So, this is equivalent to (N ∨ (O ∧ P)) and (O ∧ P ∨ N). Wait, because A ↔ B is equivalent to (A→B) ∧ (B→A). So, (N → (O ∧ P)) ∧ ((O ∧ P) → N).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to break down each proposition into their logical components.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a step-by-step approach to assign true/false values to each proposition and see if any combination works.

Let me write down the propositions again:

1. ~N ≡ (O · P) → So, either N is true and O and P are both false, or N is false and O and P are both true.

Wait, no. The equivalence is ~N ≡ (O ∧ P). So, ~N is equivalent to (O ∧ P). So, this is equivalent to saying that ~N is true when O and P are both true, and false otherwise.

Wait, wait. Wait, if ~N is equivalent to (O · P), then that would mean that either both O and P are true, making ~N true, or both are false, making ~N false. Wait, no. Wait, the equivalence would mean that ~N is true exactly when O and P are both true. So, that is, when O and P are both true, ~N is true. Otherwise, ~N is false.

So, the first proposition is that either both O and P are true, and N is false, or both O and P are false, and N is true.

Second proposition: ~O ⊃ Q → which is equivalent to O ∨ Q. Because ~O implies Q is the same as O OR Q.

Third proposition: N · ~Q → which is N ∧ ~Q. So, N is true and Q is false.

So, now, the three propositions are:

1. [O ∧ P] → ~N is true → So either O ∧ P is true and N is false, or O ∧ P is false and N is true.

2. O ∨ Q is true.

3. N ∧ ~Q is true → So N is true and Q is false.

Hmm, so from proposition 3, Q is false. So in the truth table, Q must be false.

So, looking at proposition 2, O ∨ Q must be true. Since Q is false, O must be true. Because if O is true, then O ∨ Q is true regardless of Q's value. So O must be true.

So, O is true.

Now, looking at proposition 1: [O ∧ P] → ~N is true. Since O is true, [O ∧ P] is true only if P is true. So, if O is true, then for the first proposition to hold, P must be true as well. Because [O ∧ P] is true only when O and P are true.

Wait no, let me re-express proposition 1:

~N ≡ (O ∧ P) → So when that's true, that's when O and P are both true and N is false.

So, in this case, O is true, P must be true, and N must be false.

So, O = T, P = T, N = F.

From proposition 3, N is F and Q is F.

So, Q is F.

Now, let's check proposition 2: O ∨ Q → T ∨ F = T. So that holds.

So now, the current assignment is:

N = F, O = T, P = T, Q = F.

This combination makes all three propositions true.

Wait, but let me check each proposition:

1. ~N ≡ (O · P): Since N is F, ~N is T. O is T, P is T → O · P is T. So T ≡ T → true.

2. ~O ⊃ Q → O is T, so ~O is F. So F ⊃ Q → since F implies anything is T, so this is T.

3. N · ~Q → N is F, so F · anything is F. Wait, but the proposition is N · ~Q. Wait, but if N is F, then the proposition is F (N is F), so the entire expression is F, not T. But that contradicts. Wait, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no. Let's re-examine. Wait, proposition 3 is N · ~Q. So if N is F, regardless of Q, the entire expression is F. So, in the current scenario, N is F, so the proposition is F. But in the setup, for the set to be consistent, all propositions must be true. So, this is a problem. So, the assignment I made earlier doesn't satisfy all three propositions.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assignment. Let me re-examine the propositions.

Wait, from proposition 3: N ∧ ~Q must be true. So both N and ~Q must be true. So N is T, Q is F.

But from proposition 1: ~N ≡ (O · P) → N is T → ~N is F. So O · P must be F for the equivalence to hold. So either O is F or P is F, or both.

But from proposition 2: O ∨ Q must be T. Since Q is F, O must be T.

So O is T, Q is F.

Now, from proposition 1: O is T, so O · P must be equivalent to ~N. Since N is T, ~N is F. So O · P must be F. Since O is T, P must be F.

So P must be F.

So now, our assignment is:

N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F.

Let me check each proposition:

1. ~N ≡ (O · P). N is T → ~N is F. O is T, P is F → O · P is F. So F ≡ F → True.

2. ~O ⊃ Q → O is T → ~O is F. So F ⊃ Q → F implies anything is T. So Q can be anything, but in our case Q is F. So F ⊃ F is T. So proposition 2 is True.

3. N ∧ ~Q → N is T, ~Q is T → T ∧ T is T. So all three propositions are True. So this assignment works.

Wait a second, so that's a consistent valuation. So the answer options must include one that says it's consistent, with N, O, P, Q being T, T, F, F respectively.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O, and P are true and Q is false.

Option E: Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false.

Wait, let's check what each option says.

Option C: N, O are true; P and Q are false.

Wait, our assignment is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F. So that would be N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F. So N, O are true, P is false, Q is false. So in this case, the valuation is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F. But option C says P and Q are false. So that's not matching.

Wait, wait, option C says: when N and O are true and P and Q are false. So P and Q are false. So according to our assignment, P is false, which is correct as per option C.

But in that case, let's see if the other options have such a valuation.

Option E: Consistent when N and P are true and O and Q are false.

Our assignment is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F. So N and P are T, O and Q are F. So that fits option E.

Wait, but what about option C: when N and O are true and P and Q are false. That also fits. Because our assignment is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F, which is N and O true, P and Q false. So both options C and E seem to fit.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the assignments.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the propositions. Let me recheck each proposition with the assignment N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F.

1. ~N ≡ (O ∧ P). N=T → ~N=F. O=T, P=F → O ∧ P=F. So F ≡ F → True.

2. ~O ⊃ Q → O=T → ~O=F. F ⊃ Q → since Q=F, F→F is T. So that's True.

3. N · ~Q → T · T (since Q=F → ~Q=T). So T ∧ T → T. So all three propositions hold.

So the assignment works. So the valuation is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F.

Looking at the options:

Option C: when N and O are true, P and Q are false. That matches our assignment.

Option E: when N and P are true, O and Q are false. Which also matches, because in our assignment N and P are true, O and Q are false. So both C and E's conditions are correct.

Wait, but that can't be, because the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, no, the options are about the valuation, not the propositions. So the correct valuation is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F.

So the correct option would be one where the valuation is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Consistent valuation when N, O are true and P, Q are false. That's correct because in our case, N and O are true, P and Q are false.

Option E: Consistent when N and P are true, O and Q are false. Which is also correct because N and P are true, O and Q are false.

Wait, but that's conflicting because each option is a separate choice. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assignment.

Wait, but according to our evaluation, the assignment N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F satisfies all three propositions. So the valuation is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, only one of them can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the evaluation of the propositions.

Wait, perhaps I should check the third proposition again. The third proposition is N · ~Q. So N is T, Q is F → ~Q is T. So T ∧ T is T. So that's correct. So yes, all three propositions are true in this assignment.

So which options match this assignment?

Looking at the options:

Option C: N and O are true; P and Q are false. That's exactly our assignment.

Option E: N and P are true; O and Q are false. That's also correct because N and P are T, O and Q are F.

So wait, that's a problem because only one option can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third proposition. Let me re-express the propositions using the assignment.

Wait, no, in the assignment N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F, all three propositions are true.

So the correct valuation is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F.

Looking at the options, which option states that? Let's see the options again.

Option C: "Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O are true and P and Q are false." Which fits.

Option E: "Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false." Which also fits.

Hmm, this is confusing because both C and E seem to describe the same situation. But I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should check the propositions again.

Wait, let me re-evaluate the propositions.

Proposition 1: ~N ≡ (O ∧ P).

Our assignment: N=T → ~N=F. O=T, P=F → O ∧ P=F. So F ≡ F → True.

Proposition 2: ~O ⊃ Q → O=T → ~O=F. F→Q is T regardless of Q's value. So since Q=F, F→F is T.

So that's correct.

Proposition 3: N · ~Q → N=T, Q=F → ~Q=T. So T·T=T.

So all three are True, so the assignment is correct.

Now, looking at the options, which one matches? Option C and E.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me check option C. The option says "consistent when N and O are true and P and Q are false."

Yes, that's correct.

Option E says "consistent when N and P are true and O and Q are false." Also correct, because in our case, N and P are T, O and Q are F. So both options C and E describe the same situation, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assignment. Let me recheck the propositions.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's try to find a possible assignment that satisfies all three propositions.

From proposition 3: N is T and Q is F.

From proposition 2: O must be T because O ∨ Q is T, and Q=F → O=T.

From proposition 1: O is T → O·P must be T only if P is T. Because ~N is T when O·P is T. But N is T → ~N is F. So O·P must be F. Since O is T, P must be F.

So P must be F. So the assignment is N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F.

So the valuation is as I thought.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: N, O true; P and Q false.

Option E: N and P true; O and Q false.

Both are correct, but according to the options, only one can be correct. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake because both are correct. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis earlier. Let me re-express all the propositions with the assignment.

Another approach: perhaps I can use the method of resolution or truth tables to find if a consistent valuation exists.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a truth table approach.

But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to express the propositions in a way that shows a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I should try to find if any of the propositions are contradictory, which would show the set is inconsistent.

Wait, for example, looking at the first two propositions:

1. ~N ≡ (O ∧ P)
2. ~O ⊃ Q

Let me try to see if these can be combined to find a contradiction.

From proposition 1: ~N ↔ (O ∧ P).

From proposition 2: O ∨ Q.

So, perhaps using these, we can find a relationship.

Wait, but if we can find a situation where both are true, no contradiction arises. So perhaps they don't lead to a contradiction.

Wait, but maybe combining them with another proposition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the assignment that satisfies all three propositions as I did earlier, and see which option matches.

So, the correct options are C and E. But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the propositions. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third proposition. Let me re-express the third proposition again. It's N · ~Q.

In the assignment, N is T, Q is F → so ~Q is T. So N · ~Q is T·T=T.

So all three propositions are true, so the assignment is correct. So the correct options are C and E.

Wait, but I think that's impossible because only one option can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assignment.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assignment. Let me re-examine the propositions with N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F.

Proposition 1: ~N is F; O·P is F. So F ↔ F → True.

Proposition 2: ~O is F → F → Q. But Q is F. So F → F is True.

Proposition 3: N is T, ~Q is T. So T · T= T.

So all are True. So the assignment is correct.

So the correct options would then be C and E. But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the propositions.

Wait, let's try to see if any of the propositions lead to a contradiction.

Looking at the first two propositions:

1. ~N ≡ (O ∧ P)
2. ~O ⊃ Q → O ∨ Q.

So, let's try to see if any combination leads to a contradiction.

Let me think in terms of the possible truth values.

Let me consider all possible truth values for N, O, P, Q and see if any set of four where all three propositions are true exists.

But that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find that the assignment I found is correct, but it's the same as another option.

Wait, in the assignment N=T, O=T, P=F, Q=F, that's option C.

Because option C says when N and O are true, and P and Q are false.

So option C is correct.

Option E says when N and P are true, and O and Q are false. But that's another situation that also holds, so perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the options are:

A. Inconsistent.

B. Inconsistent.

C. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O are true and P, Q are false.

D. Inconsistent.

E. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false.

So, according to our analysis, the correct option is C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the propositions. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I should check the third proposition again. The third proposition is N · ~Q. So N is T, Q is F → ~Q is T. So T · T is T. So that's correct.

So the correct option is C. So the answer is C.
</think>

The correct answer is **C**. The analysis shows that the set of propositions is consistent when $N$ and $O$ are true, and $P$ and $Q$ are false. Specifically:

- **N = T**, **O = T**, **P = F**, **Q = F**.

This assignment satisfies all three propositions:

1. $\sim N \equiv (O \cdot P)$ → $F \equiv (T \cdot F)$ → $F \equiv F$ → True.
2. $\sim O \supset Q$ → $F \supset F$ → True.
3. $N \cdot \sim Q$ → $T \cdot T$ → True.

Thus, the set of propositions is consistent under these valuation conditions.

ANSWER: C
