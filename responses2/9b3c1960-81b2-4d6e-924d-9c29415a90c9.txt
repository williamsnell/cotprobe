Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about what happens to the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output when the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left. I remember that the aggregate supply (AS) curve represents the total supply of goods and services in an economy at different price levels. 

An upward sloping AS curve means that as the price level increases, the quantity of output supplied increases too. If the AS curve shifts to the left, that means at every price level, the quantity supplied has decreased. So any economy that was at a certain price level will now supply less output at that same price. 

Wait, how does this affect equilibrium? Equilibrium occurs where the aggregate demand (AD) curve intersects the AS curve. If AD remains unchanged, a leftward shift in AS would mean that, at the same price level, the economy can't produce as much. So the point where AD meets AS moves. 

Let me visualize this. Imagine the AS curve moving left, so at any given price, less quantity is supplied. The AD curve is fixed. So the new equilibrium is at a lower quantity. Because the same price level can't support as much output. So the price level would probably stay the same? Or does it decrease?

Wait, no. If the AS curve shifts left, the intersection with AD would lower the price level because at the same price, less exists. Or wait, perhaps I should think about the numbers. 

Let me think in terms of equations. The equilibrium occurs where Y = AD(P). If the AS shifts left, the AD curve remains the same. So the new equilibrium will be at a lower price level because the same amount of output can't be produced at lower prices. But wait, no, wait. The price level itself is determined by the intersection. If AD is fixed, and AS is lower, then the point where AD meets the lower AS is at a lower price level. Because if you imagine a leftward shift, the intersection point moves to the left (lower quantity, lower price). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait another way: before the shift, the economy was at (P1, Y1). After the AS curve shifts left, the same price level, P1, can't support the same quantity, Y1. So the economy might move to (P2, Y2) where P2 is lower, because at that lower price level, the same Y is supplied. Wait, but if the price level decreases, then at the lower price, the quantity supplied is lower. So perhaps the equilibrium quantity decreases, but the price level would also decrease.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think of an example. Suppose the AS curve shifts left so that at a given price level, the quantity supplied is lower. If the overall AD is unchanged, the new equilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded equals the lower quantity supplied at that price. So price would have to be lower because the same amount of real output is available at a lower price level. So the price level would decrease, and output would decrease as well. 

Wait, but the question is about the new equilibrium price level and quantity. So with a left shift in AS, the equilibrium price level decreases, and the quantity decreases. But wait, that's not an option. Let me check the options.

Looking again, the options are:

A: price level decreases, output increases. That's if AS shifts right.

B: price increases, output decreases. No, because if AS shifts left, and AD is same, the price would decrease.

C: price and output both decrease. That's what I'm thinking.

Wait, if the AS shifts left, and AD is unchanged, the equilibrium point is where the lower AS intersects the same AD. So the price level would be lower, and the output would be lower. So option C says price and output both decrease, which would be correct.

Wait, but the options are options A to J. Let me check all options.

Option C: equilibrium price level and quantity of output decrease. That's correct.

But wait, the question is, when the AS curve shifts to the left, what happens. So the answer should be that price decreases, quantity decreases. So option C.

Wait, but let me think again. What if the AS curve shifts left, but the AD curve is also shifted. Hmm, no, the question says the AS shifts to the left; it doesn't mention AD. So the AS shifts, AD remains same.

So, when AS shifts left, with AD unchanged, the new equilibrium is at a lower price level and lower quantity because the same amount of output is available at a lower price. So the equilibrium price level decreases, and the equilibrium quantity of output decreases. So option C says this.

Wait, no, looking again at the options:

Options:

A: price decreases, quantity increases. No, because AS left reduces quantity, not increases.

B: price increases, quantity decreases. Not correct.

C: price and quantity both decrease. Correct.

D: price remains same, quantity decreases. No, because AS left, so quantity must decrease.

E: both increase. No, AS left leads to lower price and lower qty.

F: price decreases, qty decreases. Correct.

G: both remain same. No.

H: price decreases, qty remains. No, because qty decreases.

I: price increases, qty remains. No.

J: both fluctuate. No.

So the correct answer would be C.

When the aggregate supply (AS) curve shifts to the left, it means that at every price level, the quantity supplied decreases. This shift occurs because the economy can produce less output at the same price level. Given that the aggregate demand (AD) curve remains unchanged, the new equilibrium occurs where the lower AS intersects the unchanged AD. At this point, the price level decreases because the same quantity of goods and services is now available at a lower price level, and the equilibrium quantity of output also decreases as the lower price level limits production.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The equilibrium price level does not increase; it decreases.
- **B**: Incorrect. The equilibrium price level does not increase; it decreases.
- **C**: Correct. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output both decrease.
- **D**: Incorrect. The equilibrium price level does not remain constant; it decreases.
- **E**: Incorrect. Both the price level and quantity do not increase.
- **F**: Incorrect. The price level does not decrease; it decreases.
- **G**: Incorrect. The price level does not remain constant; it decreases.
- **H**: Incorrect. The price level does not decrease; it decreases.
- **I**: Incorrect. The price level does not increase; it decreases.
- **J**: Incorrect. The equilibrium does not fluctuate unpredictably.

The correct answer is **C: The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.**
