Okay, so I've got this question about permutations and cycles. Hmm, let me think. The question is about two statements: Statement 1 says every permutation is a cycle, and Statement 2 says every cycle is a permutation. Then I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Wait, what's a permutation and a cycle? I remember that in group theory, a permutation is just a rearrangement of the elements. Like, if I have three elements, a permutation could be swapping two and leaving one the same. A cycle is a bit more specific. I think a cycle is when you have a sequence where each element is moved to the next position, and the last one loops back to the first. So, in a cycle of length 3, each element is part of a cycle.

Now, statement 1: Every permutation is a cycle. Is that true? Let me think. If I have a permutation that's not a single cycle, like a transposition (which is a 2-cycle), does that count as a cycle? Wait, no. A 2-cycle is a cycle of length 2, but a permutation that's not a single cycle, like a 3-cycle, is a cycle. So, not all permutations are cycles. For example, take a permutation that's a product of two cycles. Wait, no, a permutation can't be a product of two cycles in the same way. Or wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, a permutation is a bijection, right? So, in symmetric group terms, every permutation can be expressed as a single cycle or as a product of disjoint cycles. So, a permutation is a cycle if it's a single cycle. Otherwise, it's a product of cycles. So statement 1 says every permutation is a cycle. That's not true because there are permutations that are not single cycles. So statement 1 is false.

Statement 2: Every cycle is a permutation. Hmm, the reverse. A cycle is a specific kind of permutation. So every cycle is indeed a permutation because the cycle is a rearrangement of elements. So statement 2 is true.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Looking at the options, which one matches that? Let me check the options:

A: Not enough info, False. That would be if either statement is false, but the question is about both. Wait, no, because option G is Not enough info, Not enough info, which is for when we can't determine anything about both statements. But in this case, we can determine both: statement 1 is false, 2 is true. So G would not be correct. Looking at options, D is True, True. No, because 1 is false. So, the options I'm looking at are:

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is D: True, True? Or wait, let me look again.

The options are:

A: Not enough info, False

B: False, False

C: Not enough info, True

D: True, True

E: True, False

F: True, Not enough info

G: Not enough info, Not enough info

H: False, True

I: False, Not enough info

J: Both statements are partially true.

Wait, no. Wait, option D is True, True. But statement 1 is false. So the correct pair is (False, True). Looking at the options, option H is False, True.

But wait, let me double-check. Statement 1: "Every permutation is a cycle." No, that's not true. So statement 1 is false. Statement 2: "Every cycle is a permutation." That's true. So the pair is (False, True). Looking at the options, option H is False, True.

But wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me make it clear.

Statement 1: Every permutation is a cycle. So, is this true? No, because a permutation can be a product of cycles, not a single cycle. For example, a transposition is a 2-cycle, which is a cycle, but wait, a 2-cycle is a cycle of length 2, and a permutation can be a product of two such cycles. Wait, no, in symmetric group theory, every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles. So a permutation is a cycle if it's a single cycle. So statement 1 is false because not all permutations are cycles. Statement 2 is true because any cycle is a permutation.

So the pair is: statement 1 is false, statement 2 is true. So the correct option is H: False, True.

Looking at the options, H is False, True. So the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is H: False, True.
