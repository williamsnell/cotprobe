Okay, so I have this question about calculating the frequency of a hydrogen transition. The transition is from n = 101 to n = 100. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula, but I think it's related to the Rydberg formula. Wait, the Rydberg formula gives the wavelength of spectral lines in the hydrogen atom. Oh right, the formula is 1/λ = R*(1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)), where R is the Rydberg constant. And once I have the wavelength, I can find the frequency using the speed of light equation (c = λ * ν).

Wait, so first I need to find the Rydberg constant. Oh wait, I think the Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. So plugging in the values. The transition is from n2 = 100 to n1 = 101. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait, n in Rydberg formula is the initial state. Wait, no, the formula is 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²). Oh wait, actually, I think it's 1/λ = R * [1/(n_initial)^2 - 1/(n_final)^2] or the other way around. Wait, let me get this straight. The Rydberg formula is:

1/λ = R * (1/n^2_initial - 1/n^2_final)

Wait, no, I think it's 1/λ = R [1/(n1)^2 - 1/(n2)^2] when n2 is higher. So in this case, n1 is 101, n2 is 100? Or wait, let me think. When the electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, the final state is lower. So the initial state is 101, and the final is 100. So n1 is 101, n2 is 100. So the formula would be 1/λ = R * (1/(101)^2 - 1/(100)^2).

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. Actually, the Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R * (1/n^2 for the initial state - 1/n^2 for the final state). So when an electron moves from a higher level to a lower one, so n_final is lower. So if you have a transition from n_final to n_initial, the formula is the same. But wait, sometimes I get confused with the notation. Let me structure it.

The Rydberg formula is:

1/λ = R * (1/(n_initial)^2 - 1/(n_final)^2 )

So in this case, n_initial is 101, n_final is 100. So plugging in:

1/λ = R*(1/(101)^2 - 1/(100)^2) = R*( (1/10201) - (1/10000) )

Calculating the differences:

1/10201 is approximately 9.803e-5 (since 10201 is 100^2 + 201, but perhaps I should compute it exactly). Wait, 100^2 is 10000. So 101^2 is 10201.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term more accurately. Let's compute 1/101^2 and 1/100^2.

1/101² = 1/(10201) ≈ 0.00009803.

1/100² = 1/10000 = 0.0001.

So their difference is 0.00009803 - 0.0001 = -0.00000197.

R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. So 1/λ = 1.097e7 * (-0.00000197) = 1.097e7 * (-1.97e-6) = let's compute that.

Wait, 1.097e7 is 10,970,000. Multiply by -1.97e-6 (which is 0.00000197), so 10,970,000 * 0.00000197.

Wait, 10,970,000 *0.000001 = 10.97. Then 10,970,000 * 0.00000097 is about 10.97 * 0.97 ≈ 10.63. So total 10.97 + 10.63 = 21.6? Oh wait that can't be right because the product would be negative which would imply λ is negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.097e7 * (-0.00000197). Let me write 1.097e7 as 10,970,000. 10,970,000 * 0.00000197 = (10,970,000 * 1.97 ) * 1e-6.

Wait, 10,970,000 * 1.97 = 21,360,900. Hmm, no, wait, 10,970,000 * 1.97 = approx 21,360,900.

Wait, no: 10,000,000 * 1.97 is 19,700,000. 970,000 *1.97 is approximately 1,910,900. So total is 21,610,900. Multiply by 1e-6 gives 21.6109.

Wait, but that's 1.097e7 * (-1.97e-6) = -21.6109 m^-1. So 1/λ = -21.6109 m^-1. But wavelength is positive, so I must have made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the formula. Oh wait, in the Rydberg formula, the denominator is n_initial^2 minus n_final^2. So if n_initial is 101 and n_final is 100, n_initial^2 is 10201, and n_final^2 is 10000. So 10201-10000=201. So 1/λ = R * (100^2 - 101^2)/(100^2 * 101^2) )? Or wait, no. Wait, the formula is 1/λ = R (1/(n_final)^2 - 1/(n_initial)^2) )? Or the other way around?

Wait, no, the Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R [ 1/(n_final)^2 - 1/(n_initial)^2 ] ?

Wait, I think I got the order wrong. Let me think: the formula is 1/λ = R [ 1/(n_final)^2 - 1/(n_initial)^2 ].

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think about when the transition happens. For hydrogen, when an electron moves from a higher n to a lower n, the photon emitted has a certain wavelength. So in the formula, 1/λ is equal to R multiplied by (1/(n_final)^2 - 1/(n_initial)^2). Because as n_initial increases, the term 1/(n_initial)^2 becomes smaller, so for higher n_initial, the denominator is smaller, making 1/λ positive.

Wait, no. Let me think with an example. Let's take n_initial = 2, n_final = 1. Then 1/λ = R (1/1^2 - 1/2^2) = R (1 - 0.25) = 0.75 R.

Wait, for the Balmer series (n_initial = 2), the wavelengths are in the visible range. But here, we have n_initial = 101 and n_final = 100. So n_initial is larger than n_final. So 1/λ = R (1/(100^2) - 1/(101^2)).

Wait, that would make 1/λ positive if 1/(100^2) is larger than 1/(101^2). Which it is, so 1/λ is positive.

Wait no, the formula is 1/λ = R [ 1/(n_final)^2 - 1/(n_initial)^2 ].

Wait, so 1/(n_final)^2 is 1/100^2, and 1/(n_initial)^2 is 1/101^2. So 1/λ = R ( 1/10000 - 1/10201 ). That's positive? Because 1/10000 is larger than 1/10201. So 1/λ is positive, which is correct because the wavelength is positive and we're talking about emission.

But wait, if the transition is from n=101 to n=100, the electron is moving down, so it's emitting a photon, which moves to lower energy, so the wavelength is in the ultraviolet range maybe. But I'm getting a negative number because of the way I wrote the formula. Oh wait, no. Let me compute the values again.

Wait, 1/(100^2) is 0.0001, and 1/(101^2) is approximately 0.00009803. So 0.0001 - 0.00009803 = 0.00000197. So 1/λ = R * 0.00000197. R is 1.097e7 m^-1. So 1.097e7 * 0.00000197 = 21.6 m^-1. So λ = 1/21.6 meters = approximately 0.0463 meters, which is 4.63 cm. Wait, that's ultraviolet, which fits with emission from high energy levels.

So now, once λ is known, I can find the frequency using c = λ * ν. c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s. So ν = c / λ.

So λ is 4.63e-2 meters. So ν = 3e8 m/s / 4.63e-2 m = 3e8 / 4.63e-2. Let me compute that.

3e8 is 300,000,000. Divide by 4.63e-2 (which is 0.0463). So 300,000,000 / 0.0463 ≈ Let's compute it.

300,000,000 / 0.0463 ≈ 300,000,000 * (1/0.0463) ≈ 300,000,000 * 21.6075 ≈ 6.48225e9 Hz.

Wait, 300,000,000 / 0.0463.

Wait, wait, 0.0463 * 6.48e9 is 0.0463 * 6.48e9 = 6.48e9 * 4.63e-2.

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute 3e8 / 4.63e-2.

3e8 is 3 * 1e8.

4.63e-2 is 4.63 * 1e-2.

So 3e8 / 4.63e-2 = (3 / 4.63) * (1e8 / 1e-2) )= (approx 0.646) * 1e10 = 6.46e9 Hz.

So the frequency is approximately 6.46e9 Hz. Let's match this with the options.

Looking at the options:

Option I: 4.5e9 Hz

Option F: 2.2e10 Hz

Option A: 9.7e8

Option D: 5.1e9

Option H: 7.3e12

Option G: 1.2e9

Option B:3.28e15

Option C:6.5e9

Option E:8.8e14

Option J:1.6e9.

So the calculated frequency is approximately 6.46e9, which is closest to option C: 6.5e9 Hz.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1/λ = R (1/(100²) - 1/(101²)) 

= 1.097e7 * ( (101² - 100²) / (100² * 101²) )

Because 1/(a^2) - 1/(b^2) = (b² - a²)/(a² b²)

So 101² is 10201, 100² is 10000. So 10201 - 10000 = 201.

So 1/λ = 1.097e7 * (201) / (10000 * 10201) )

Let me compute the denominator: 10000 * 10201 = 10000 * 10200 + 10000 *1= 102,000,000 + 10,000 = 102,010,000.

So denominator is 1.0201e8.

So 1.097e7 * 201 = ?

1.097e7 = 10,970,000.

Multiply by 201:

10,970,000 * 200 = 2,194,000,000 (approx)

10,970,000 * 1 = 10,970,000.

Total is 2,194,000,000 + 10,970,000 = 2,204,970,000.

Wait, okay. So the numerator is 2,204,970,000 

Denominator is 102,010,000.

2,204,970,000 / 102,010,000 = let's compute this.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10,000: 220,497 / 10,201.

Wait, 10201 is 100^2 + 201? Wait, 10201 is 101^2. Oh wait, 101^2 is 10201, right. So 10201 is 101².

220,497 divided by 10,201.

Let me compute how many times 10,201 fits into 220,497.

10,201 * 21 = 214,221. 

Subtracting: 220,497 - 214,221 = 6,276.

10,201 * 0.615 is approximately 6,276 (since 10,201 * 0.6 = 6,120.6; 10,201 *0.015=153.015; sum is 6,273.615. Close to 6,276.

So approximately 21.615.

So 1/λ = 21.615 m^-1.

So λ = 1/21.615 ≈ 0.04624 meters, which is 4.624 centimeters, or 46.24 mm. That's in the ultraviolet range.

Then, ν = c / λ = (3e8 m/s) / (4.624e-2 m) = 3e8 / 4.624e-2 

= 3e8 / 4.624e-2 = (3 / 4.624) * (1e8 / 1e-2) ) = (approx 0.648) * 1e10 = 6.48e9 Hz.

So the calculated frequency is approximately 6.48e9 Hz, which is closest to option C (6.5e9 Hz).

Wait but looking back at the options, option C is 6.5e9, which is exactly what I got.

To calculate the frequency of the hydrogen transition from the principal quantum number \( n_i = 101 \) to \( n_f = 100 \), we use the Rydberg formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right),
\]

where \( R \) is the Rydberg constant, approximately \( 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \). Substituting \( n_f = 100 \) and \( n_i = 101 \):

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{100^2} - \frac{1}{101^2} \right).
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{100^2} = 0.0001 \) and \( \frac{1}{101^2} \approx 0.00009803 \). The difference:

\[
\frac{1}{100^2} - \frac{1}{101^2} = 0.0001 - 0.00009803 = 0.00000197.
\]

Now, multiply by \( R \):

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \times 0.00000197 = 21.6109 \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the wavelength \( \lambda \) is:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{21.6109} \approx 0.04624 \, \text{m} = 4.624 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Next, calculate the frequency \( \nu \) using the speed of light \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{0.04624} \approx 6.48 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Finally, compare this result with the provided options:

- **Option C: \( 6.5 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)**  
This is the closest match to the calculated frequency.
