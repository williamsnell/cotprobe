Okay, so I've got this question about Brownian motion and whether a certain process is a martingale. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is about whether M(t) = exp(i W(t)) / E[exp(i W(t))] is a martingale. Wait, right, a martingale is a process where the expected value of the future price, given the current information, is equal to the current price. So M(t) needs to satisfy E[M(t+Δt) | F_t] = M(t), where F_t is the information available up to time t.

First, let's understand what W(t) is. Brownian motion, or Wiener process, has some key properties: it's a continuous-time stochastic process, has independent increments, and is normally distributed with mean zero. Oh wait, but W(t) is a real-valued process, I think. So exp(i W(t)) would involve the exponential of i times a real number, which is a complex number on the unit circle. But wait, if W(t) is real, then exp(i W(t)) is e^{i W(t)}, which equals cos(W(t)) + i sin(W(t)).

So E[exp(i W(t))] is the expectation of cos(W(t)) + i sin(W(t)). Since W(t) is a Gaussian process with mean zero (I think), let's compute that expectation. The expectation of e^{i a X} where X is a Gaussian variable with mean μ and variance σ² is e^{i a μ - (1/2) a² σ²}. So here, a is 1, μ is 0, and σ² is t (since variance of W(t) is t). So E[exp(i W(t))] = e^{- (1/2)(1)^2 t} = e^{-t/2}.

So the denominator in M(t) is e^{-t/2}, so M(t) is exp(i W(t)) * e^{t/2} because we can factor out the denominator. So M(t) = exp(i W(t)) * e^{t/2}.

Now, to check if M(t) is a martingale, we need to see if E[M(t+Δt) | F_t] = M(t). Let's write out M(t+Δt):

M(t+Δt) = exp(i W(t+Δt)) * e^{(t+Δt)/2}.

Expanding W(t+Δt) as W(t) + W(t+Δt) - W(t) (the increment over time Δt), but I think more accurately, W(t+Δt) = W(t) + ΔB, where ΔB is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance Δt. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, since W(t) is a martingale, the expectation E[W(t+Δt) | F_t] = W(t). But I'm not sure how that helps directly with M(t).

Wait, let's think about the process M(t). Since M(t) is e^{i W(t)} scaled by e^{t/2}, perhaps it's a Martingale because of the exponential function, but I need to verify.

Let me compute the expectation of M(t+Δt) given F_t. So E[exp(i W(t+Δt)) * e^{(t+Δt)/2} | F_t].

We can factor out the e^{(t+Δt)/2} as it's known. So it's e^{t/2 + Δt/2} * E[exp(i (W(t) + ΔW)) | F_t], since W(t+Δt) = W(t) + ΔW, where ΔW is the increment over Δt.

ΔW is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance Δt. So E[exp(i W(t+Δt)) | F_t] = E[exp(i (W(t) + ΔW))] = exp(i W(t)) * E[exp(i ΔW)].

E[exp(i ΔW)] is the characteristic function of ΔW. Since ΔW is normal with mean 0 and variance Δt, the characteristic function is e^{- (1/2)(i ΔW)^2 * Δt}.

Wait, no: for a normal variable X ~ N(μ, σ²), E[e^{i a X}] = e^{i a μ - (1/2) a² σ²}.

Here, a is 1, μ is 0, σ² is Δt. So E[exp(i ΔW)] = e^{- (1/2)(1)^2 Δt} = e^{-Δt/2}.

So putting it all together:

E[exp(i (W(t) + ΔW)) | F_t] = exp(i W(t)) * e^{-Δt/2}.

Therefore, E[M(t+Δt) | F_t] = e^{t/2 + Δt/2} * exp(i W(t)) * e^{-Δt/2}.

Simplify the exponents: e^{t/2 + Δt/2} * e^{-Δt/2} = e^{t/2}.

So E[M(t+Δt) | F_t} = e^{t/2} * exp(i W(t)) = M(t).

Because M(t) is e^{t/2} * exp(i W(t)), so E[M(t+Δt) | F_t] = M(t). That's the condition for a martingale.

So yes, M(t) is a martingale.

To determine whether \( M(t) = \frac{\exp(i W(t))}{\mathbb{E}[\exp(i W(t))]} \) is a martingale, we analyze its properties. Here, \( W(t) \) is a Brownian motion, and \( \mathbb{E}[\exp(i W(t))] \) is the expectation of \( \exp(i W(t)) \), which can be computed as \( e^{-t/2} \) using the characteristic function of a normal variable. Thus, \( M(t) = \exp(i W(t)) \cdot e^{t/2} \).

A martingale requires that \( \mathbb{E}[M(t+Δt) | \mathcal{F}_t] = M(t) \). Expanding \( M(t+Δt) \), we have:
\[
M(t+Δt) = \exp(i W(t+Δt)) \cdot e^{(t+Δt)/2}.
\]
Taking the conditional expectation:
\[
\mathbb{E}[M(t+Δt) | \mathcal{F}_t] = e^{t/2 + Δt/2} \cdot \mathbb{E}[\exp(i (W(t) + ΔW)) | \mathcal{F}_t],
\]
where \( ΔW \) is the increment of Brownian motion over \( Δt \), a normal variable with mean 0 and variance \( Δt \). The expectation simplifies to:
\[
\mathbb{E}[\exp(i (W(t) + ΔW)) | \mathcal{F}_t] = \exp(i W(t)) \cdot e^{-Δt/2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\mathbb{E}[M(t+Δt) | \mathcal{F}_t] = e^{t/2} \cdot \exp(i W(t)) = M(t).
\]
This satisfies the martingale condition. Therefore, \( M(t) \) is a martingale.
