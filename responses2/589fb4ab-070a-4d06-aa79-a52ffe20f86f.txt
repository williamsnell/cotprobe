Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about energy expenditure through protein. So, I need to find out what percentage of the man's daily energy requirement is met by protein. Right, the man is a 70 kg man, and he's consuming 3000 Kcal per day. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, the question says he's on a diet yielding 3000 Kcal per day. Wait, no, wait, the problem says he's a 70 kg man, excreting 27.0g of urea daily. And the question is about the percentage of his daily energy requirement met by protein. Oh wait, no, the question is about the energy he uses, not his intake. Wait, let me read the question again.

Wait, no, the question says: "a 70 kg man excretes27.0g of urea daily. What percentage of his daily energy requirement is met by protein?" Oh, okay, so the 27g is urea excreted. So, he's using urea as part of his diet. But the question is about how much of his energy requirement is met by protein.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, I think I might have misunderstood. Because the man's diet is 3000 Kcal, but the problem gives his urea excretion as 27g. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again.

The question says: On a given diet yielding 3000 Kcal per day, a 70 kg man excretes27.0g of urea daily. What percentage of his daily energy requirement is met by protein? Assume that gram of protein yields 4 Kcal and 0.16g of nitrogen as urea.

Wait, I think I might have misread that. Wait, the question is about the percentage of his energy requirement met by protein. But the data given is about urea excretion, not energy. Oh, wait, perhaps the 3000 Kcal is the energy requirement? Or is it the intake?

Wait, no, the question says, "a 70 kg man excretes 27.0g of urea daily." So, his urea excretion is 27g. But the question is about the percentage of his daily energy requirement met by protein. So, perhaps the 3000 Kcal is his daily energy requirement. Because the question is about how much of that is met by protein.

Wait, but the question says, "excretes27.0g of urea daily." So, he excretes 27g of urea, which probably comes from his diet. So, the energy requirement is 3000 Kcal, and he's using 27g of urea. But the question is about how much of his energy requirement is met by protein.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to outline the problem.

The man's energy requirement (daily) is 3000 Kcal. His daily urea excretion is 27.0g. We need to find the percentage of his energy requirement met by protein.

Wait, but the question says, "met by protein." So, perhaps he is using some protein as part of his diet, and the question is how much of his energy is coming from protein.

Wait, but the data given is about protein's contribution to urea. Oh, perhaps I need to compute how much protein is needed to produce 27g of urea, and then find what percentage that protein is of his 3000 Kcal energy requirement.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The man's diet is 3000 Kcal per day. But he's also excreting 27g of urea. The question is about how much of his energy requirement is met by protein. So, the 3000 Kcal is his energy use, and he's using 27g of urea (from his diet). But the question is about how much of his energy requirement is from protein.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as: the protein he uses is providing some energy, and the urea (which is 27g) is part of his energy expenditure. But the question is about how much of his energy requirement is coming from protein.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me restate. The question is: How much of his energy requirement is met by protein. So, the 3000 Kcal is his daily energy. He is using some energy from protein and others from other sources, but we're to find the percentage of the 3000 Kcal that comes from protein.

But the data given is about the urea excreted. So, the man excretes 27g of urea, but he's also consuming 3000 Kcal. The question is, what percentage of his daily energy requirement (3000 Kcal) is met by protein.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the man's diet is 3000 Kcal, and his body uses some of it via protein, while other parts via other nutrients like water, etc. But the question is about the contribution of protein.

But the problem also gives data that 1 gram of protein yields 4 Kcal, and 0.16g of nitrogen as urea. Wait, but the question is about urea excretion, which is 27g. So, the man is excreting 27g of urea. Each gram of protein gives 0.16g of nitrogen as urea. So, to find how much protein is needed to produce 27g of urea.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: The man excretes 27g of urea. But how much protein does that correspond to?

Wait, the problem says, "Assume that gram of protein yields 4 Kcal and 0.16g of nitrogen as urea." So, each gram of protein contributes 0.16g of urea. So the amount of protein needed to produce 27g of urea is 27g / 0.16g/g = 168.75 grams of protein. But wait, wait: wait, no, because 0.16g of nitrogen per gram of protein. So 27g of urea would come from how much protein?

Wait, no, because 1 gram of protein gives 0.16g of N. So, for 27g of N, the protein needed is 27g / 0.16g/g = 168.75 grams of protein. So, 168.75g protein.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of his daily energy requirement (3000 Kcal) met by protein. So, if he uses 168.75g of protein, each gram of protein gives 4 Kcal, so 168.75g *4 = 675 Kcal from protein.

Then, the percentage is (675 / 3000) *100 = 22.5%.

Looking at the options, option I is 22.5%.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the numbers. 27g of urea. Each gram of protein gives 0.16g of N. So grams of protein needed = 27 / 0.16 = 168.75g.

Then, protein provides 4 kcal per gram, so 168.75 * 4 = 675 kcal.

Total energy is 3000 kcal.

So, 675 /3000 = 0.225, which is 22.5%. So the answer is I, 22.5%.

Wait, but the question says, "met by protein." So, that's the portion from protein. So the answer is 22.5%.

Looking at the options, I is 22.5%.

The question asks for the percentage of a 70 kg man's daily energy requirement (3000 Kcal) that is met by protein, given that he excretes 27.0 g of urea daily. Each gram of protein yields 4 Kcal and 0.16 g of nitrogen as urea. 

To determine the energy contribution from protein:

1. **Urea to Protein Conversion**:  
   The man excretes 27.0 g of urea. Since 1 gram of protein produces 0.16 g of urea, the amount of protein required is:  
   \[
   \text{Protein} = \frac{\text{Urea}}{\text{Urea per gram of protein}} = \frac{27.0 \, \text{g}}{0.16 \, \text{g/g}} = 168.75 \, \text{g of protein}.
   \]

2. **Energy from Protein**:  
   Each gram of protein yields 4 Kcal, so the energy contribution from protein is:  
   \[
   \text{Energy from protein} = 168.75 \, \text{g} \times 4 \, \text{Kcal/g} = 675 \, \text{Kcal}.
   \]

3. **Percentage of Daily Energy Requirement**:  
   The man's daily energy requirement is 3000 Kcal. The percentage of energy met by protein is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{675 \, \text{Kcal}}{3000 \, \text{Kcal}} \right) \times 100 = 22.5\%.
   \]

Thus, the percentage of the man's daily energy requirement met by protein is **22.5%**.
