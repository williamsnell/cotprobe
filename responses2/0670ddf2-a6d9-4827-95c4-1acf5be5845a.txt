Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about determining the atomic weight of natural chlorine. Hmm, I've studied this a bit, but let me think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that natural chlorine is a mixture of two isotopes. 75.53% of the element is chlorine-35, which has a mass of 34.968 atomic mass units (amu). And the remaining 24.47% is chlorine-37, with a mass of 36.956 amu. I need to find the atomic weight of natural chlorine.

Wait, atomic weight is basically the average mass of all the isotopes. So it's like a weighted average based on their natural abundance. Oh right, so I have to calculate the weighted average of the two isotopes' masses using their percentages as weights.

So, the formula for the atomic weight (A) is the sum of each isotope's mass multiplied by its abundance. Let me write that out: A = (percentage of 35Cl × mass of 35Cl) + (percentage of 37Cl × mass of 37Cl).

But wait, percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing by 100. So 75.53% becomes 0.7553, and 24.47% becomes 0.2447.

Plugging the numbers in: A = (0.7553 × 34.968) + (0.2447 × 36.956).

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: 0.7553 × 34.968. Let me calculate that. 0.7553 * 34 is about 25.68, and 0.7553 * 0.968 is approximately 0.729. Adding those gives roughly 25.68 + 0.729 = 26.409.

Wait, maybe it's better to do it more accurately.

34.968 × 0.7553:

Let me break it into parts. 34.968 * 0.7 = 24.4776. Then 34.968 * 0.0553.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach. Or maybe think about it as 0.7553 = 0.75 + 0.0053.

So:

34.968 * 0.75 = 26.226.

34.968 * 0.0053 = let's see, 34.968 * 0.005 is 0.17484, and 34.968 * 0.0003 is 0.01049. So adding, 0.17484 + 0.01049 = 0.18533.

So total first part: 26.226 + 0.18533 = 26.41133.

Second part: 36.956 × 0.2447.

Again, break it down. 36.956 * 0.2 = 7.3912, 36.956 * 0.04 = 1.47824, 36.956 * 0.0047 (approx 0.0047 is 4.7e-3) → 36.956 * 0.004 = 0.147824, 36.956 * 0.0007 = 0.0258692. Summing 1.47824 + 0.147824 + 0.0258692 ≈ 1.651933.

Wait, maybe a more accurate way. Alternatively, I can compute 36.956 * 0.2447.

Let me compute it step by step.

0.2447 = 0.2 + 0.04 + 0.004 + 0.0007.

So 36.956 * 0.2 = 7.3912.

36.956 * 0.04 = 1.47824.

36.956 * 0.004 = 0.147824.

36.956 * 0.0007 = 0.0258692.

Adding all together: 7.3912 + 1.47824=8.86944; +0.147824=9.017264; +0.0258692=9.0431332.

So the second part is 9.0431332.

Now, the total atomic weight is 26.41133 (from the first part) + 9.0431332 (second part) = 35.4544632.

Hmm, approximately 35.45.

Looking at the answer options, option H is 35.45. Option G is 35.75, which is higher. Option D is 34.968.

Wait, but I'm getting about 35.45. So the correct answer should be H: 35.45.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations, because sometimes I make errors in multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

But let's think again. Let me re-calculate the first part: 34.968 * 0.7553.

34.968 * 0.75 = 26.226.

34.968 * 0.0053 = ?

Wait, 34.968 * 0.005 =0.17484, 34.968 * 0.0003=0.0104904.

So total 0.17484 +0.0104904=0.1853304.

So 26.226 + 0.1853304 = 26.4113304.

Then the second part: 0.2447 *36.956.

36.956 *0.2 =7.3912.

36.956 *0.04 =1.47824.

36.956 *0.004 =0.147824.

36.956 *0.0007=0.0258692.

Adding these: 1.47824 + 0.147824=1.626064; +0.0258692=1.6519332.

So 7.3912 + 1.6519332=9.0431332.

Now, add the two parts: 26.4113304 +9.0431332=35.4544636.

Which rounds to approximately 35.4545, so about 35.45.

Looking at the options, option H is 35.45, which matches.

To determine the atomic weight of natural chlorine, we calculate the weighted average of the masses of its two isotopes based on their natural abundances. The formula for the atomic weight (A) is:

\[
A = (0.7553 \times 34.968) + (0.2447 \times 36.956)
\]

Breaking this down:

1. Calculate the contribution of chlorine-35:
   \[
   0.7553 \times 34.968 = 26.4113304
   \]

2. Calculate the contribution of chlorine-37:
   \[
   0.2447 \times 36.956 = 9.0431332
   \]

3. Add the contributions:
   \[
   A = 26.4113304 + 9.0431332 = 35.4544636
   \]

Rounding to two decimal places, the atomic weight of natural chlorine is approximately **35.45**.

Among the options provided:
- **H: 35.45** matches the calculated value.
