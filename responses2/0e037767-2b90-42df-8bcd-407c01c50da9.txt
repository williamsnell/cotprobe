Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me read it again. It says, "Suppose that we roll two fair 6-sided dice. What is the probability that the two numbers rolled sum to 4?" And then there are several options provided.

Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving dice, each die is independent and has six possible outcomes. So for two dice, there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. That's a standard starting point.

Now, the question is asking for the probability that the sum of the two dice is 4. So I need to find how many outcomes result in a sum of 4 when you add the two individual dice rolls.

Let me list out all the possible pairs of numbers (a, b) where a is the result of the first die and b is the result of the second die, and a + b = 4. 

Starting with the smallest possible number on a die, which is 1. If the first die is 1, then the second die needs to be 3 (because 1 + 3 = 4). So that's one combination: (1,3).

Next, if the first die is 2, then the second die needs to be 2 (because 2 + 2 = 4). So that's another combination: (2,2).

Then, if the first die is 3, the second die would need to be 1 (3 + 1 = 4). So that's a third combination: (3,1).

If the first die is 4 or higher, say 4, then the other die would have to be 0, which isn't possible because dice only go from 1 to 6. So any higher than 3 on the first die would make the second die have to be less than 1, which is impossible. So that's it.

So the possible pairs are (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1). That makes three favorable outcomes.

Since there are 36 total possible outcomes when rolling two dice, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total possible outcomes. So 3 divided by 36.

Simplifying that, 3/36 reduces to 1/12. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Oh wait, 36 divided by 3 is 12. So 3/36 is 1/12. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other combinations.

Wait, I think I missed a possible combination. Wait, if the first die is 4, second die would need to be 0, which is impossible. So I don't think I missed any. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the possible sums.

Alternatively, I can list all possible two-dice combinations that add up to 4. The possible pairs are:

1 and 3: (1,3)
2 and 2: (2,2)
3 and 1: (3,1)
4 and 0: (4,0) → invalid
0 and 4: (0,4) → invalid
So yes, only three valid combinations.

Therefore, the probability is 3/36, which simplifies to 1/12. So looking at the options provided, option G is 1/12. So that's the correct answer.

The probability that the two numbers rolled sum to 4 is 1/12.

Answer: G: \frac{1}{12}
