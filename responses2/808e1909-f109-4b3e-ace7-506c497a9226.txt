Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about images in a plane mirror. The question is asking about the distance of the image behind the mirror. The options are various expressions involving the person's height or distance from the mirror.

Hmm, I remember that plane mirrors form images that are virtual, upright, and same size as the object. So the image is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it. That makes sense. So if someone is standing a certain distance in front, their image is the same distance behind.

Wait, but the options don't mention height or distance from the mirror. They're all referring to height or distance from the mirror. So the question is about the distance of the image.

So, the image's distance from the mirror is equal to the object's distance from the mirror. So if someone is 2 meters in front, the image is 2 meters behind. That would mean the distance of the image is twice the distance in front. So in this case, the image is behind the mirror, and the distance is the same as the object's distance in front.

Looking back at the options: option G says "twice your distance from the mirror." That matches what I thought. So the correct answer should be G.

The distance of the image behind a plane mirror is equal to the distance of the object in front of the mirror. This means the image is twice as far from the mirror as the person is from it. 

Answer: G
