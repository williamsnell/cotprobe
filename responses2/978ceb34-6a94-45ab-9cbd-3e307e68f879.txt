Question:

A state built a racetrack that was specially designed and constructed for thoroughbred horseracing. State bonds were issued to finance the construction of the racetrack. The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the racetrack was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. After the racetrack was built and in operation for two years, the state legislature passed a bill requiring the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for the discounted admission fee of 50 cents. This law is probably

Options:

A: unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.
B: constitutional, because it supports social welfare by providing discounts to senior citizens.
C: unconstitutional, because it discriminates on the basis of age.
D: constitutional, because the state has the power to change admission prices.
E: unconstitutional, because it violates the rights of the bondholders.
F: unconstitutional, because it goes against the state's responsibility to repay bonds.
G: constitutional, because the state has the right to regulate commerce within its borders.
H: unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.
I: unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.
J: constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about state bonds and a new law. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question describes a state that built a racetrack specially for horse racing. They issued state bonds to finance its construction. The bond agreement says that for the first five years, the racetrack was in operation, and at least $2 from each admission charge would go towards repaying bond debt. But if the initial five-year funding wasn't enough, then the next five years' bonds would be covered with the remaining money.

Then, after two years, the state legislature passed a bill requiring senior citizens over 65 to admit at a discounted rate of 50 cents. The question is whether this law is constitutional or not.

I need to figure out what kind of legal issue this falls into. I remember that in constitutional law, certain laws are considered unconstitutional if they violate principles like equal protection, the right to be served, or if they impede a contract.

Looking at the options, the options are about whether the law is constitutional or not. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Unconstitutional because it denies equal protection. So, this law would be about denying equal protection. I think this is about a law that treats different groups differently. The law is for senior citizens, which is a different age group. The bond agreement allows for some years of discounting, but now a new law is requiring them to pay full price. I'm not sure if this directly violates equal protection, but I think the issue is whether the law is discriminatory. It's not that it's unfair to older people, but that it's differentiating their eligibility based on age. Alternatively, it might infringe on the right to admission, which could relate to equal protection.

Option B: Constitutional because it supports social welfare. This seems more about the law providing social benefits. But the question is about constitutional validity, not about the law's purpose. Plus, the law is about admission, so it's about the state's powers.

Option C: Unconstitutional because of age discrimination. That's a direct issue about whether the law is discriminatory. Admissions based on ageâ€”some people can't get in, others can. But the law doesn't specify that it's the same as before. It says the discounted rate of 50 cents. So, maybe it's not about age discrimination, but rather the way of admission. So, C might not be the issue.

Option D: Constitutional because the state can regulate prices within its borders. I'm not sure about this. State laws can regulate prices? I thought states can set their own prices, but sometimes they have to follow certain regulations. But the state already set a 50-cent admission fee. Now the law is a requirement to admit certain people. I'm not entirely sure if the state has the power to regulate prices. For example, sometimes states have to abide by local regulations, but the ability to set prices might depend on whether there are regulations in place. Alternatively, perhaps the state's original bond agreement allows for some discounts, and the new law is a change that could be constitutional if it's within the state's powers.

Option E: Unconstitutional because it violates the right of bondholders. The law is about admission, so if it's about state's power, perhaps it's about the state's obligation to repay bonds. If the law is about the state's power to regulate, it might not directly affect the obligations of the bondholders. However, the issue is whether it's unconstitutional. For example, if it's a law that's not necessary under the state's powers.

Option F: Unconstitutional because it goes against the state's responsibility. This is a strong possibility. If the law is about regulating the price of admission, it might be a violation of the state's responsibility to ensure that the bondholders (or whoever holds the bonds) are properly funded. The original bond agreement allows for a certain amount to be used for repayment. If the law is making the state hold onto the money it's already used for repaying, that could be an unconstitutional change to the state's existing obligations. That's a common issue in constitutional law: when a new law affects the state's existing obligations.

Option G: Constitutional because the state has the power to regulate commerce within its borders. I think that's a good point. The state has the power to set its own prices and regulations. So if the new law is about regulating the price, it might be constitutional. But the wording says "regulate the price within its borders." I'm not sure if that's the same as regulating admission. However, the state can regulate its own operations, so perhaps the new law is permissible. But I'm not certain.

Option H: Unconstitutional because it's an ex post facto law. That's about whether the law was a result of a past event. Ex post facto laws are often considered invalid because they don't stand on their own. But this law is now part of the racetrack's operation, so it's a present law. I don't think ex post facto applies unless the law was derived from a past action. But since it's a new law, it's probably not. So H could be incorrect.

Option I: Unconstitutional because it impairs the contract. That would be if the law affects the contract between the state and the bondholders. But in this case, the law is about the state's power to regulate, not about the contract. So I'm not sure. It might not interfere with the contract, but it's about the state's power to do something.

Option J: Constitutional because it's a justifiable exercise of police power. I remember that in some places, the state can regulate the use of its police force. But this law is about admission, not about police usage. Maybe it's about regulating the price, which is a separate issue.

Now, back to the main point. The key issue seems to be whether the law violates the state's power to regulate or whether it's a discriminatory law.

The state has the power to regulate commerce within its borders. So, if the law imposes a price regulation, it might be constitutional. However, the law is about differentiating between senior citizens and others. I'm not sure if that's a violation of equal protection. For example, the law is changing the way people get in, but it's for a different group. Some might argue that it's not discriminating because it's not excluding the older population, just requiring them to pay full price. So the law may not be discriminatory because it's not denying any rights, just requiring a different method. 

Wait, the law requires them to pay 50 cents. So for those over 65, they can't get in without paying this fee. But others can get in with the usual rate. So, the law is changing the admission process. So, it's not that different people can't get in; it's that some can only get in under a different condition. So, perhaps it's not discriminatory because it's not excluding any group, just making them pay more. So, the law doesn't treat any group differently in terms of rights; it's just a change in the way they can get in.

Alternatively, if the law is making it harder for certain groups, it might be considered discriminatory. But in this case, the law is for a specific group (senior citizens over 65) who have a different price. So the court would have to determine whether that's a violation of equal protection.

Wait, the issue is about whether the law is constitutional. So, if the law is about creating a new requirement for a specific group, but not excluding them, then it's about whether it's a change that's allowed under the state's powers.

Another angle: the law is for a specific group, so it's not about the state being discriminatory. It's about the state's power to regulate. So, the state can set prices and regulations within its borders. Therefore, the new law is constitutional because the state has the power to regulate the price of admission.

Wait, but option C is about age discrimination. Does it relate to that? The law is about the price, not the age. So C might not be the issue.

So, the options are:

Which of these options is correct? Let me consider the possible options again.

Option F: Unconstitutional because it violates the state's responsibility to repay bonds.

If the law is part of the state's operations, then it's a change to the state's obligations. The original bond agreement allows for a certain amount to be used to repay; if the law now requires the state to hold onto the money used for that, it might be unconstitutional because it's a change to the state's obligations, which are already in place.

So, the law is now making the state hold onto money they're already supposed to use for bond repayment. That's a violation of their existing obligations, which would make it unconstitutional.

So, the law is part of the state's operations, and it's a change in the state's obligations. This would make it unconstitutional. So that's option F.

Alternatively, option E says it violates the rights of the bondholders. But the law affects the state's own operations, not the bondholders' obligations. So E is about the state's own actions, not the bondholders' rights.

So, the correct answer is F. The law violates the state's responsibility to repay bonds because it's affecting the state's current obligations.
</think>

The question revolves around determining the constitutionality of a new law that imposes a discounted admission fee on senior citizens over 65, which was previously allowed under a bond agreement. The law is part of the state's operations and directly affects the state's existing obligations to repay bond debt.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option F**: This option suggests the law violates the state's responsibility to repay bonds. The law is a change to the state's operations, altering its obligations to repay bond debt. Since the law is part of the state's ongoing operations and affects its existing obligations, it violates the state's responsibility to fulfill its contractual obligations. This makes it unconstitutional.

2. **Other Options**:  
   - **Option A**: The law does not deny equal protection; it only affects the admission process for a specific group.  
   - **Option B**: The law supports social welfare, but it does not directly address equal protection.  
   - **Option C**: The law does not discriminate on the basis of age, as it only applies to a specific group of senior citizens.  
   - **Option D**: The state's power to regulate commerce applies, but the law's focus is on price regulation rather than economic regulation.  
   - **Option E**: The law does not violate the rights of bondholders; it affects the state's obligations.  
   - **Option G**: While the state has the power to regulate commerce, the law's focus is on price, not economic regulation.  
   - **Option H**: The law is not an ex post facto law.  
   - **Option I**: The law does not impair a contract; it merely changes the admission process.  
   - **Option J**: The law does not impede police power; it is about admission fees.  

### Conclusion:
The law violates the state's responsibility to repay bonds by altering its existing obligations. Therefore, the correct answer is **F**.
