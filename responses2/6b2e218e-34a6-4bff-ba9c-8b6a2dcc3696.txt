Okay, so I have this question about May C. Carlisle's expenses during her business trip. I need to figure out how much money she had left after all her spending. Let me read the question again carefully.

She spent various amounts: hotel, meals, laundry, tips, taxis, telephone, customer entertainment, and supplies. She started with $300 and paid cash. I need to add up all her expenses and subtract that total from $300 to find out how much she has left.

Let's list out the expenses:

- Hotel: $63.00
- Meals: $42.90
- Laundry: $3.75
- Tips: $9.50
- Taxis: $7.85
- Telephone: $11.30
- Customer entertainment: $36.60
- Supplies: $4.30

Hmm, adding up all these numbers. I'll do it step by step to avoid mistakes.

First, I'll add the larger amounts first to make it easier.

Start with the hotel: 63.00. Then meals: 42.90. Let me add those. 63 + 42.90 is 105.90 so far.

Next, laundry: 3.75. Adding that to 105.90 gives 109.65.

Then tips: 9.50. Adding 9.50 to 109.65 brings us to 119.15.

Taxis: 7.85. Adding that, 119.15 +7.85 equals 127.00.

Telephone: 11.30. Adding that, 127 +11.30 is 138.30.

Customer entertainment: 36.60. Adding that: 138.30 +36.60 = 174.90.

Finally, supplies: 4.30. Adding that, 174.90 +4.30 = 179.20.

Wait, that's the total she spent. So she started with $300, so subtracting the total expenses from 300.

300 - 179.20 = ?

300 minus 179 is 121, and then minus 0.20 is 120.80.

So she has $120.80 left. Looking at the options, option A is $120.80.

Wait, let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to add wrong when doing this in my head.

Let me add them all again, perhaps a more systematic way.

Amounts:

63.00

42.90

3.75

9.50

7.85

11.30

36.60

4.30

First, add up each place value.

Starting with dollars:

63 +42=105, +3=108, +9=117, +7=124, +11=135, +36=171, +4=175.

Now cents: 00 +90=90, +75=165, +50=215, +85=300, +30=330, +60=390, +30=420. So total is $179.20.

Yes, that's correct. So total expense is $179.20. Subtract from $300.

300 -179.20 = 120.80. So answer is A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 120.80, which matches. Are there any other options? Let me glance through the options again.

Options:

A: 120.80

B: 150.45

C: 300.00

D: 178.55

E: 179.20

F: 134.90

G: 98.10

H: 63.00

I: 121.70

J: 111.25

Wait, option E is 179.20, which is the total she spent. So she started with 300, so 300 -179.20 = 120.80, which is option A.

To determine how much May C. Carlisle had left after her business trip, we need to calculate her total expenses and subtract that from her initial amount of $300.

1. **List of Expenses:**
   - Hotel: $63.00
   - Meals: $42.90
   - Laundry: $3.75
   - Tips: $9.50
   - Taxis: $7.85
   - Telephone: $11.30
   - Customer Entertainment: $36.60
   - Supplies: $4.30

2. **Total Expenses Calculation:**
   - Sum the amounts step by step:
     - 63 + 42.90 = 105.90
     - 105.90 + 3.75 = 109.65
     - 109.65 + 9.50 = 119.15
     - 119.15 + 7.85 = 127.00
     - 127.00 + 11.30 = 138.30
     - 138.30 + 36.60 = 174.90
     - 174.90 + 4.30 = 179.20

3. **Subtract Total Expenses from Initial Amount:**
   - $300.00 - $179.20 = $120.80

4. **Answer:**
   - The correct option is A: $120.80.

**Answer: A: $120.80**
