Question:

A woman joined a web site to get her credit reports. The site required creation of an account before she could enter. On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?

Options:

A: The company will prevail because the woman had the opportunity to review the terms and conditions before agreeing to them.
B: The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.
C: The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.
D: The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.
E: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.
F: The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.
G: The woman will prevail because she did not explicitly agree to the recurring charges.
H: The woman will prevail because she was not given explicit notice of the recurring charges.
I: The company will prevail because the woman did not cancel her subscription and thus accepted the terms.
J: The woman will prevail because the terms were not explicitly stated before she made the initial payment.

Okay, let me try to work through this question step by step. So, the question is about credit reports and whether a woman got bound when she started paying for her subscription. I need to figure out which party will prevail on this issue.

First, I'll read the scenario carefully. The woman joined a website to get her credit reports, and there was a form she had to fill. On that form, there was a notice in bold letters: "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She didn't access the terms because she could have done so by clicking a link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. The next six months, her credit card was automatically billed $50 without notice, except she received email notice. The terms and conditions say she must have authorized the charges unless she notifies the company otherwise in advance.

So, the key points here are the terms and conditions, the automatic billing without notice, and the explicit mention of the subscription needing to be canceled before agreeing. 

The question is about whether the woman was bound to pay for the 6 months. So, the issue is whether she has breached her contract.

I think this falls under the concept of express vs. implied agreement. The terms and conditions here mention that she must have given proper notice before agreeing. So, if she didn't cancel her subscription, she might have breached the terms.

Wait, but the woman didn't cancel. She paid the subscription. The problem is whether she was bound to pay despite paying. So, the contract was about not being given notice. She didn't give notice, so she breached the contract. That would mean the company should have been bound, right?

But wait, the question is asking who will prevail. The options are about the company or the woman. So, I'm trying to see if she was bound to pay. If she didn't cancel, she's not agreeing, so she breached. So, the company would have to be bound.

Alternatively, maybe the terms were in place, but she didn't cancel. Or perhaps the automatic billing without notice is a red herring because she received notice email, but the terms say she must have given notice before agreeing. Since she didn't, she breached.

Another point: the terms mention that she must have notified the company otherwise in advance. So, not notifying means she breached.

But wait, the woman didn't cancel the subscription. So, she's in breach of contract. So, the company should be bound.

Looking at the options, options E and I say the company will prevail. Option E: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.

Wait, no. If she didn't cancel, she didn't agree. So she breached. So, the company should have been bound.

Alternatively, the company's terms require her to have given notice. If she didn't, she breached. So, the company's obligation is violated, so they must be bound. So, the company should win.

Wait, but let me think again. The woman didn't pay the $50 for the subscription. The automatic billing was $50 per month, but she didn't notice. The terms say she must have notified the company otherwise in advance. So, she didn't do that. She didn't cancel. So, she breached.

So, the option that says the company is bound is E or I. E says she failed to cancel, implying she agreed. I says she didn't cancel, so she accepted. I think E is incorrect because failing to cancel means she breached.

But wait, the options may not be the direct answer. Let me look at the options again.

Option E: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms. Wait, no. If she didn't cancel, she didn't agree. So she breached. So, the company is bound.

But wait, the option E says the company implicitly agreed. That's the opposite of what's happening. So, that's incorrect.

Option I: The company will prevail because she didn't cancel, so she accepted. So, the company is bound. I think that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, the terms can be ambiguous. For example, if the contract says you must give notice before agreeing, but the notice isn't given, is that a breach? Yes.

So, the correct answer should be I: the company will prevail because she didn't cancel, thus implicitly agreed.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about similar law. If a contract requires you to give notice, and you don't, you breached. So, the company is bound to follow. So, the option saying the company will prevail because she didn't cancel is correct, which is option I.

But wait, the options are A to J, and I is option I. So, the correct answer is I.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-read the options.

The options are:

A: The company will prevail because the woman had the opportunity to review the terms and conditions before agreeing.

B: The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.

C: The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.

D: The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.

E: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.

F: The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.

G: The woman will prevail because she did not explicitly agree to the recurring charges.

H: The woman will prevail because she was not given explicit notice of the recurring charges.

I: The company will prevail because the woman did not cancel her subscription and thus accepted the terms.

J: The woman will prevail because the terms were not explicitly stated before she made the initial payment.

So, the correct reasoning is that the woman breached the contract by not giving notice, so the company is bound. So, option I says the company will prevail because she didn't cancel, so she accepted. That aligns with my reasoning.

Wait, but is the option E correct? Or is I correct?

Option E says she failed to cancel, thus "implicitly agreed." Wait, no. If she didn't cancel, she didn't agree. So, she breached, so the company is bound. So, the correct answer is I.

Wait, no. Wait, if the company says "implicitly agreed," that would mean she agreed, which isn't the case. So, the correct answer is I, which says the company accepted because she didn't cancel.

But wait, let me think again. If she didn't cancel, she didn't agree. So, she breached. So, the company is bound. So, the company will prevail because she didn't cancel.

So, option I is correct.

Wait, but another angle: the terms say she must have notified the company otherwise in advance. If she didn't, she breached. So, the company can't force her to pay. So, the company will prevail. So, option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the court would hold that the terms are enforceable, but she didn't comply.

So, the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is **I: The company will prevail because the woman did not cancel her subscription and thus accepted the terms.**

### Explanation:
The scenario revolves around whether the woman was bound by the credit terms after paying her subscription. The terms require her to have given proper notice before agreeing to the charges. Since she did not cancel her subscription and thus did not agree to the terms, she breached the contract. The company, therefore, is bound by these terms, and the correct outcome is that the company will prevail. 

- **Option E** incorrectly states that failing to cancel implies agreement, which is not correct. 
- Other options either misrepresent the issue or lack relevant reasoning. 

Thus, the company's enforceability of the terms is certain, making option I the correct choice.
