Alright, so I've got this problem here about a square on a Cartesian plane. The points given are (1,2) and (7,4), and they say these are opposite vertices of a square. I need to find the area of the square.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some basics about squares and coordinate geometry. Opposite vertices in a square mean that they are diagonally across from each other. So, the line connecting these two points is the diagonal of the square.

I remember that the length of the diagonal of a square can help find the area. The formula for the diagonal (d) of a square with side length (s) is d = s√2. So if I can find the length of the diagonal between (1,2) and (7,4), I can then find the area.

Wait, wait. Let me write that down. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the distance formula: √[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So applying that here, the distance between (1,2) and (7,4) would be √[(7-1)^2 + (4-2)^2] = √[6^2 + 2^2] = √[36 +4] = √40. That's the length of the diagonal.

But wait, I thought the diagonal of a square is s√2. So if the diagonal is √40, then s√2 = √40. Solving for s, we'd get s = √40 / √2 = √(40/2) = √20. So the side length is √20.

But the problem asks for the area of the square. The area is side squared, so (√20)^2 = 20. So the area should be 20.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the diagonal formula correct? Oh, yes, for a square, the diagonal squared equals twice the area. Or perhaps more directly, the area is (diagonal)^2 / 2. Wait, that's another way to remember it: Area = (d^2)/2. Since d is √40, then area is (√40)^2 / 2 = 40/2 = 20. Yep, same answer.

So the area is 20. Looking at the options, option B is 20. So I think the answer should be B.

But wait, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me visualize the square. If two opposite vertices are (1,2) and (7,4), then the center of the square would be the midpoint between these two points. The midpoint formula is ((x1 +x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). So midpoint is ((1+7)/2, (2+4)/2) = (4,3). So the center is (4,3).

The diagonal goes from (1,2) to (7,4), which is a vector of (6,2). The length of this vector is √(6^2 + 2^2) = √40, which is correct. So the diagonal is √40, which as we've calculated earlier leads to an area of 20.

Alternatively, another approach: The side length can be found using the vectors from the center. Each half of the diagonal is √20, so half of that is √10. But wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, using the Pythagorean theorem for the square's diagonal.

Wait, maybe another way to find the area is to compute the length of the side using the vectors. The side vectors would be the displacement from one vertex to the next, but perhaps using the distance formula between adjacent vertices isn't straightforward without knowing the other points.

Wait, but since we know the diagonal, perhaps another formula applies. The area is (diagonal^2)/2, which is what I used earlier. So 40/2 = 20. Yep, that's correct.

So the area is 20, which is option B.
</think>

The distance between (1,2) and (7,4) is √[(6)^2 + (2)^2] = √40, which is the diagonal of the square. Using the formula for the area of a square with diagonal d, Area = d² / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20. Thus, the area is 20.

Answer: B
