Okay, so I have this question here about Singer's work and the "all animals are equal" argument. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which principle Singer concluded flowed from. The options are a bunch of different ethical principles, like principal principle, equal consideration, etc. I remember that Singer was a philosopher known for his work on the ethics of animal rights and the human condition.

The title of the question refers to the argument that all animals are equal. There's a famous axiom that says no two animals are equal, which is often linked to the idea of equality. I think Singer discussed this in his work, particularly in his book "The Ethics of Animal Rights."

Looking at the options, the first one is the principal principle. I'm not too sure about that. The principle of equal consideration is about treating people equally, which might be more about justice rather than equality of being. The principle of animal rights is one of the options, but that's more about the rights themselves, not the conclusion that comes from them.

The principle of speciesism is about treating different species equally, which seems related but I'm not sure. The principle of moral equality is another one; I think that's a broader principle of equality in ethics. The principle of maximizing happiness is about overall well-being, and minimizing suffering is about minimizing negative effects.

Wait, the question is specifically about why the conclusion "all animals are equal" flows from a particular principle. I recall that in Singer's work, he argues that the equal treatment of animals is a necessary condition for their rights. The "all are equal" principle comes from the idea that no animal is more deserving than another. This is a form of moral equality.

So looking at the options, the correct one should be the principle of moral equality. That makes sense because it directly ties to the concept of equality in the context of animal rights. The other options, like the principle of equal consideration, might be about justice, not the equality of animals themselves.

The correct answer is the principle of moral equality. This principle is the key to understanding why "all animals are equal" flows from it, as Singer argues it's a necessary condition for the animals' rights.
