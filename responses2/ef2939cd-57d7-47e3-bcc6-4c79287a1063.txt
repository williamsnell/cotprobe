Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying wire. Hmm, let's think. I remember that when a wire carries a current, the magnetic field forms certain patterns around it. 

Wait, what's the usual shape? I think it's circular. Like, the field lines circle around the wire. So if I picture the wire, the field lines go in circles around it, right? So for a straight wire, the field lines are circular. That would mean the answer is circles, which is one of the options. Looking at the options, option H is circles. So I think that's the correct one.

I remember that Ampère's Law says the magnetic field around a long straight wire is circular. So yes, the field lines are circular. Therefore, the answer should be option H.

The magnetic field lines about a current-carrying wire are circular. This is a direct consequence of Ampère's Law, which describes the circular field lines around a long, straight wire carrying current. 

Answer: H
