Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about the total energy released when a comet hits the Earth. Hmm. The comet's mass is m, and it impacts Earth, which has mass M and radius R. The impact happens at the minimum speed possible. And I need to find the expression for the total energy released.

Wait, what's the total energy in this context? I remember that energy in physics can be kinetic and potential. Oh right, the total mechanical energy would be the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy.

The formula for gravitational potential energy is U = - G*M*m / R, where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, m is the comet's mass, and R is Earth's radius. Oh wait, but when the comet hits Earth, it's moving very fast. But the question says it hits at the minimum speed. Oh, right. At the point of closest approach, the velocity is such that the kinetic energy is just enough to overcome the gravitational pull, but I think for minimum speed, the velocity is such that the kinetic energy is as low as possible, but perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, the question is about the total energy released. When the comet hits the Earth, it's losing energy because it's converting some of its kinetic energy into heat and other forms. But the question might be simplifying things and just asking for the gravitational potential energy, or maybe it's using the specific energy in the impact.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is the kinetic energy lost plus the gravitational potential energy gained or lost. Let me think again. When the comet hits the Earth, it's moving towards the Earth. The kinetic energy it has at the point of impact is (1/2)mv², where v is the velocity. But since it's moving at the minimum speed, perhaps that's the speed at which just enough energy is lost to break free from Earth's gravity. But the total energy might be the kinetic energy at that point plus the potential energy at that point.

Wait, potential energy is negative because when the comet is very far away, it has less potential energy. But when it's on Earth's surface, it's at -G*M*m/(R) (assuming R is the radius, so the distance from Earth's center is R). But if the comet hits Earth, its position is R, so potential energy is U = -G M m / R.

Wait, but wait, when the comet is very far away, its potential energy is -G M m / (infinity) which is zero. So as the comet approaches Earth, its potential energy becomes more negative. So at the impact point, its potential energy is U = - G M m / R. 

But the kinetic energy at the impact point is (1/2) m v², but wait, the question says it's at the minimum speed. So at the minimum speed, the kinetic energy is such that the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is at a certain point. Wait, but wait, when the comet just barely escapes Earth, its speed is such that the kinetic energy equals the escape velocity. But in this case, it's hitting Earth, so perhaps the kinetic energy is lower than the escape velocity.

Wait, but the question is about the energy released in the impact. So the energy released is the kinetic energy that's converted into heat and other forms. Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is the energy released. Or wait, maybe the change in potential energy when the comet hits Earth.

Wait, when the comet hits Earth, its kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. So the total energy released would be the amount of kinetic energy that the comet loses, which would be the sum of its kinetic energy and the change in potential energy.

Wait, but the kinetic energy at the impact point is (1/2) m v². The potential energy at impact is U = - G M m / R. The potential energy at rest would be zero if it's at infinity. So the change in potential energy is U - U_infinity = (- G M m / R) - 0 = - G M m / R.

So the total energy released is the kinetic energy plus this change in potential energy. Wait, but wait, the kinetic energy is the energy that was present before the impact. The potential energy is part of the system that's lost. So perhaps the total energy released is the sum of the kinetic energy and the change in potential.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the comet hits Earth, it has a certain amount of kinetic energy and potential energy. The potential energy is negative, which means it's bound energy. So the total energy (kinetic + potential) would be the sum. But the total energy released is the amount of energy that's lost as the comet moves from its original position to the impact point.

Wait, perhaps the total energy released is the kinetic energy at the impact point. Because the potential energy is already part of the system's energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) of the comet at the point of impact would be the sum. So, if it's moving at speed v, then KE is (1/2) m v². The potential energy is U = - G M m / R.

So the total energy is (1/2) m v² - G M m / R. But I'm not sure if that's the expression we're looking for.

Wait, wait, but the question is about the "total energy released in the impact." Hmm. I think that refers to the kinetic energy that's converted into other forms because it's moving towards Earth. Or perhaps it's the energy that the comet has when it hits, which would be the sum of KE and PE.

Wait, but the question says the comet impacts at minimum speed. Hmm, the minimum speed implies that the velocity is such that it just barely escapes Earth's gravity. But wait, no, for the minimum speed, the velocity is when the kinetic energy is just enough to start the impact, but the velocity isn't zero. Wait, no, minimum speed might be when the velocity is the lowest possible for a collision without being too slow. I'm a bit confused on that part. But perhaps for this problem, the minimum speed isn't directly relevant, and the problem is about the energy released when the comet hits.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the specific energy, i.e., the energy per unit mass. So for the total energy, it's the specific energy, which is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy per unit mass.

So specific energy (epsilon) is the sum of (1/2 v²) and (- G M / R). So epsilon = (1/2 v²) - (G M / R).

But wait, the question is asking for the expression for the total energy released. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the gravitational potential energy at the point of impact. No, the potential is negative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the comet impacts at the minimum speed. That suggests that the velocity is zero at the point of closest approach. But that can't be right because if it's hitting Earth, it's moving in the direction of Earth's gravity. Wait, no. The minimum speed for an impact would be when it's just about to collide. But maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: The energy released would be the kinetic energy that the Earth gains from the impact. But wait, the Earth's kinetic energy would be the same as the comet's, but that's not the case because the Earth isn't moving; the only moving object is the comet.

Wait, perhaps the total energy released is the kinetic energy of the comet at the point of impact. So if the comet's speed is v, then (1/2) m v².

But wait, the question doesn't give any information about the velocity, other than the minimum speed. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the speed is such that the kinetic energy is equal to the gravitational potential energy. That would mean that the total energy is zero, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, for the minimum speed, the kinetic energy is such that it's just enough to start the impact, but the velocity isn't zero. Wait, but if the velocity is the minimum, then that's the point where the velocity is entirely used to escape Earth's gravity, but that's not possible because the velocity can't be higher than the escape velocity. The escape velocity from Earth is sqrt(2 G M / R). So if the comet's speed is the escape velocity, then the kinetic energy is (1/2) m (2 G M / R) = m G M / R. The potential energy at the surface is - G M m / R, so the total energy would be (m G M/R) - (G M m / R) = 0. But that's the total energy. Wait, but the question is asking for the total energy released in the impact.

Wait, when the comet hits Earth, it's losing kinetic energy, and gaining gravitational potential energy. So the total energy released would be the sum of the kinetic energy lost and the potential energy gained.

Wait, but the kinetic energy at the impact point is (1/2) m v². The potential energy is - G M m / R.

So the total energy released would be (1/2 m v²) + (- G M m / R) ?

Wait, but that would be the change in energy from the comet's perspective. Alternatively, perhaps the energy released is the potential energy change, which is - G M m / R. But that's not considering the kinetic energy.

Wait, but the question is about the total energy released. So perhaps it's the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy at the point of impact.

Wait, but the specific energy (epsilon) is (1/2) v² - G M / R. But since the question is asking for the expression, perhaps the options are given in terms of m, G, and R, so it's (1/2 m v²) - (G M m / R). But I don't know what v is. Oh wait, the problem states that the impact is at the minimum speed. So perhaps v is the escape velocity, which is sqrt(2 G M / R). So (1/2) m (2 G M / R) = m G M / R. The potential energy is - G M m / R. So the total energy would be (m G M / R) + (- G M m / R) ) = 0.

But that's not any of the options given. Hmm. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the total energy refers to the specific energy, which is (1/2 v²) - (G M / R). Since the velocity is the escape velocity, that's sqrt(2 G M / R), so v² is 2 G M / R.

So (1/2) * (2 G M / R) = G M / R.

So specific energy is (G M/R) - (G M / R) = 0. So the total energy released would be zero? That doesn't make sense because the comet is sticking to Earth, it's losing kinetic energy into potential energy, so the specific energy would have to be positive.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the energy when the comet hits. The kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². The potential energy is U = - G M m / R. The total mechanical energy (KE + PE) is (1/2 m v²) + ( - G M m / R ). But this is the energy of the system when the comet is at Earth's surface.

Wait, but when the comet is moving towards Earth, its kinetic energy is the sum of the initial KE and the PE at the surface. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the gravitational potential energy at the point of impact, which would be U = - G M m / R. But looking at the options, that's option F: m*(G/R). Oh wait, option F is m*(G/R). But wait, no, the actual U is - G M m / R, which isn't matching any option except option F if R is in denominator. Hmm, perhaps the question assumes that G M is being treated as a variable, and the question is about the expression. So the potential energy is - (G M m) / R. But looking at the options, option F is m*(G/R). Wait, no, the correct expression is - (G M m)/R. But none of the options present that as an option—so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: The kinetic energy of the comet when it hits Earth would be (1/2)m v², and the potential energy is U = - (G M m) / R. So the total energy is the sum.

But the question is about the "total energy released in the impact." Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy released is the change in kinetic energy plus the change in potential energy. 

Wait, when the comet hits Earth, it's losing kinetic energy (since it's moving towards Earth at speed v) and gaining potential energy. So the total energy released is the sum of the KE loss and the increase in PE.

But wait, KE loss is (1/2) m v² and the PE change is U - U_infinity = (- G M m / R) - 0 = - G M m / R.

So the total energy released would be (1/2 m v²) + ( - G M m / R ) = (1/2 m v²) - ( G M m / R )

But the problem states the velocity is at minimum speed. So perhaps v is the escape velocity, which is sqrt(2 G M / R). So v² is 2 G M / R.

Substituting, (1/2 m * 2 G M / R ) = m G M / R. And the potential energy term is - G M m / R.

So total energy released would be (m G M/R ) + (- m G M/R )= 0. But zero doesn't make sense because the comet isn't just stuck in place; it's moving, so it must have some kinetic energy.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the potential energy at the point of impact, which is - G M m / R. But looking at the options, that's not one. Option F is m (G/R), which would be m G / R. But the correct potential is - G M m / R.

Wait, but the question isn't asking about the potential energy, it's asking about the total energy released. So if the comet hits Earth, it's losing kinetic energy and gaining gravitational potential energy. So the total energy released would be the sum of the kinetic energy lost and the potential energy gained.

Wait, but the kinetic energy lost is (1/2 m v²) and the potential energy gained is ( - G M m / R ). So the total energy is (1/2 m v²) + ( - G M m / R ).

But again, the velocity isn't given, so perhaps the question is missing some info. Alternatively, perhaps the velocity is considered as the escape velocity, but that leads the total energy to be zero, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: The question might be considering the specific energy (epsilon), which is the total energy per unit mass. In that case, epsilon is (1/2) v² - (G M / R). But the velocity is the escape velocity, which is sqrt(2 G M / R). So v² is 2 G M / R. So (1/2)(2 G M / R) is G M/R.

So epsilon is (G M/R) - (G M/R) = 0. So the specific energy is zero. But that doesn't make sense because the comet is sticking to the Earth, so it's losing energy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options, option F is m*(G/R). Which is m G/R.

Option B is m*v, which is the kinetic energy.

Option C is 0.5*m*(2 G M/R²) → which would be m G M / R².

Option A is 0.5 m (2 G M/R) = m G M / R.

Wait, that's option A: 0.5 m*(2 G M/R) → m G M / R.

Wait, so option A is m G M / R. Now, where does that come from?

Wait, the potential energy is - G M m / R. So the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v², but if the velocity is the escape velocity, then v²= 2 G M/R. So 0.5 m * 2 G M/R = m G M/R. So the kinetic energy is m G M/R. The potential energy is - G M m / R. So the total energy (specific) is (m G M/R) - (G M m / R) = 0. So no, that doesn't add up.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the total energy released. The total energy would be the change in the system, which is the kinetic energy lost plus the potential energy gained. If the comet is moving towards Earth, the kinetic energy is being lost, and the potential energy is increasing (becoming less negative). So the total energy released would be the sum.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think again: the energy released would be the specific energy, which is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy per unit mass.

So, (1/2) v² (from kinetic) plus (- G M / R) (from potential).

If the velocity is the escape velocity, then v² = 2 G M / R. So (1/2)(2 G M / R) = G M / R. So (G M/R) - (G M/R) = 0.

But that can't be right because the comet isn't stationary. It must have kinetic energy upon impact. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the question is considering the potential energy at the point of impact as the only energy change. Because the kinetic energy is already part of the potential energy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the potential energy change.

Wait, the problem says the energy released is the total energy when the comet hits Earth. So that's the sum of kinetic energy (which is being lost) and the potential energy (which is being converted to kinetic).

Wait, but when the comet hits Earth, it's moving towards Earth. So the kinetic energy is being lost, and the potential energy is increasing ( becoming less negative). So the total energy released is the sum of the KE lost and the increase in PE.

Wait, no. The KE is being lost, and the PE is being converted to KE. So the total energy (KE + PE) is the energy that is being released. But the KE is (1/2 m v²), and PE is (U = - G M m / R). So the sum is (1/2 m v²) - (G M m / R).

But the question is about the expression, not the value. So the expression would be (1/2 m v²) - (G M m / R). But again, without knowing v, I can't write that expression. But the options don't include expressions with velocities. So perhaps the way I'm approaching this is wrong.

Wait, another angle: The gravitational potential energy at Earth's surface is U = - G M m / R. The kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². When the comet hits Earth, it's moving towards Earth, so the kinetic energy is being lost (converted into heat and other forms), and the potential energy is increasing (becoming less negative). So the total energy released is the sum of the KE lost and the potential energy change.

Wait, but the KE change is the loss of (1/2 m v²), and the potential energy change is ( U_final - U_initial ), which is (- G M m / R - 0) = - G M m/R.

So the total energy released is (1/2 m v²) - G M m / R.

But again, without knowing v, I can't match this to the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things. Let me think: The minimum speed would be when the comet's speed is such that it's just escaping Earth, but that's not possible because the speed at escape velocity is sqrt(2 G M / R). So perhaps the velocity is such that the total energy (specific energy) is zero. So that would be (1/2 m v²) - G M m / R = 0. So (1/2 m v²) = G M m / R → v² = 2 G M / R. So substituting, the specific energy is (2 G M / R) * 0.5 - G M m / R = (G M / R) - (G M m / R) = G M (1 - m) / R. But I don't see that as an option.

Wait, but perhaps the velocity is not the escape velocity. Maybe the velocity is just the speed at impact, which is such that the total energy is zero. So the specific energy is zero, which occurs when the velocity is sqrt(2 G M / R). Hmm, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the specific energy as the potential energy, which would be U = - G M m / R. But none of the options show that. Option F is m G/R, which is (G M m)/R. So that's positive, which doesn't make sense for a gravitational potential. So I'm confused.

Another approach: The total energy released would be the kinetic energy the comet has at the point of impact. But since the minimum speed is given, perhaps the velocity is the escape velocity, leading to the kinetic energy being (1/2 m v²) = (1/2 m) * (2 G M / R) ) = m G M / R. So the kinetic energy is m G M / R.

Looking at the options, option A is m G M / R. So option A would be the correct expression for the total energy released in the impact.

Wait, but the problem states the velocity is the minimum speed. Which would be the escape velocity, so the kinetic energy is m G M / R. So the total energy released would be this, which is option A.

So I think the correct answer is option A: 0.5 m (2 G M/R) → m G M/R.

But wait, earlier when I thought about the potential energy, it's - G M m / R, but the problem is about the total energy released, which is the kinetic energy. So perhaps option A is correct.
</think>

The problem involves determining the total energy released when a comet of mass \( m \) impacts the Earth's surface. The key considerations are:

1. **Kinetic Energy**: The total energy released is the kinetic energy of the comet at the point of impact. If the velocity is the escape velocity \( v = \sqrt{2GM/R} \), then the kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}m \left(\frac{2GM}{R}\right) = \frac{mGM}{R}.
   \]

2. **Potential Energy**: The potential energy at the Earth's surface is:
   \[
   PE = -\frac{GMm}{R}.
   \]
   However, the total energy released is the kinetic energy, not the potential energy.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - Option A: \( 0.5m \cdot \frac{2GM}{R} = \frac{mGM}{R} \) matches the calculated kinetic energy.
   - Option F: \( m \cdot \frac{G}{R} \) does not match the potential energy or kinetic energy.
   - Other options either represent different forms of energy or are not relevant to the problem.

Thus, the correct expression for the total energy released in the impact is given by option A.

ANSWER: A
