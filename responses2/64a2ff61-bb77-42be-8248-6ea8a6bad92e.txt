Question:

A planning engineer for a new alum plant must present some estimates to his company regarding the capacity of a silo designed to contain bauxite ore until it is processed into alum. The ore resembles pink talcum powder and is poured from a conveyor at the top of the silo. The silo is a cylinder $100 \mathrm{ft}$ high with a radius of $200 \mathrm{ft}$. The conveyor carries ore at a rate of $60,000 \pi \mathrm{~ft}^3 / \mathrm{h}$ and the ore maintains a conical shape whose radius is 1.5 times its height. If, at a certain time $t$, the pile is $60 \mathrm{ft}$ high, how long will it take for the pile to reach the top of the silo?

Options:

A: 10.5 $\mathrm{h}$
B: 15.7 $\mathrm{h}$
C: 16.4 $\mathrm{h}$
D:  9.8 $\mathrm{h}$
E: 13.3 $\mathrm{h}$
F: 14.0 $\mathrm{h}$
G: 8.5 $\mathrm{h}$
H: 11.2 $\mathrm{h}$
I: 12.6 $\mathrm{h}$
J: 7.2 $\mathrm{h}$

Okay, so I have this problem about a silo being filled with bauxite ore, and I need to figure out how long it will take for the ore pile to reach the top. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The silo is a cylinder with a height of 100 ft and a radius of 200 ft. The conveyor carries ore at a rate of 60,000 π ft³/h. The ore forms a cone with a radius that's 1.5 times its height. At a certain time t, the pile is 60 ft high, and I need to find how long it will take for the pile to reach the top (100 ft high).

Hmm, so the key here is to model the volume of the cone as it fills the silo and then figure out the time required to reach the final height.

Wait, but wait. The silo is a cylinder, so the total volume is πr²h, but the ore is only filling part of it in the shape of a cone. So the volume of the cone is (1/3)πR²H, where R is the radius of the base of the cone, and H is its height. But the problem says the radius is 1.5 times the height, so R = 1.5 H.

So when the pile is 60 ft high, H =60 ft, so R =1.5*60=90 ft. So the volume at that point is (1/3)π*(90)^2*60.

Wait, but the conveyor is adding ore at a rate of 60,000 π ft³/h. So the volume is increasing at that rate. So the time needed to reach the top would be the volume needed to fill from the current height (60 ft) to the top (100 ft) divided by the rate.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the pile is a cone that's increasing, and the silo is a cylinder, so the height of the cone can't exceed the height of the silo. But the problem states that the ore maintains a conical shape with radius 1.5 times the height, so when the pile is 100 ft high, the radius would be 150 ft, which is larger than the silo's radius of 200 ft. Wait, wait, silo's radius is 200 ft, so that's big enough for a cone with radius 150 ft when height is 100 ft. So the silo can hold that.

But when the pile is 60 ft high, the radius is 90 ft, which is less than 200 ft, so it's okay.

So the volume of the pile at time t is (1/3)π*(1.5 H)^2 * H = (1/3)π*(2.25 H²) H = (0.75)π H³.

Wait, so if H is the height of the cone, then V = (1/3)π R² H, and R = 1.5 H, so R² = (2.25 H²), so V = (1/3) * π * 2.25 H³ = 0.75 π H³.

So the volume as a function of height H is V = 0.75 π H³.

Wait, but wait, the conveyor is adding 60,000 π ft³ per hour. So the volume at any time t is V(t) = 60,000 π t.

Wait, but wait, when H is 60 ft, V is 0.75 π (60)^3. Let me compute that: 60^3 is 216,000. So 0.75 * 216,000 = 162,000. So V at that point is 162,000 π ft³.

But the conveyor is adding 60,000 π ft³ per hour, so the time taken to reach that volume is V / rate. So time = 162,000 π / (60,000 π) hours. The π cancels out, so 162000 /60000 = 2.7 hours. But wait, the options don't have 2.7h. So something's wrong here because the options are all in the 7-13 hour range, so that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read it.

Wait, the problem says the silo is a cylinder 100 ft high with a radius of 200 ft. The conveyor carries ore at a rate of 60,000 π ft³/hour. The ore maintains a conical shape with a radius 1.5 times its height. At a time t, the pile is 60 ft high. How long till it reaches the top.

Wait, maybe I should model the volume of the cone as it's filling up.

At any time t, the volume is V(t) = 60,000 π t.

But the cone's volume is (1/3) π R^2 H, with R =1.5 H. So substituting R, V = (1/3) π (2.25 H^2) H = 0.75 π H^3.

So V = 0.75 π H^3.

We can express H in terms of V: H = (V/(0.75 π))^(1/3).

But another approach is to find H as a function of time, given that the conveyor is adding volume at a constant rate.

Wait, but the problem is that the conveyor is adding 60,000 π ft³ per hour, so V(t) = 60,000 π t.

But the volume of the cone is also V = (1/3) π (1.5 H)^2 H = (1/3) π (2.25 H²) H = 0.75 π H^3.

So equating the two expressions for V: 

60,000 π t = 0.75 π H^3 

We can cancel π from both sides: 60,000 t = 0.75 H^3.

We can solve for H in terms of t: H^3 = (60,000 t) / 0.75 = 80,000 t.

So H = (80,000 t)^(1/3).

We want to find the time it takes to reach the top, which is when H =100 ft.

So plug H=100 into the equation: 100 = (80,000 t)^(1/3). 

Cube both sides: 100^3 = 80,000 t.

100^3 is 1,000,000.

So 1,000,000 = 80,000 t → t = 1,000,000 /80,000 = 12.5 hours.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the steps again because the time I get here is 12.5 hours, which is option I (12.6 h, which is close). But wait, earlier I thought at H=60, V is 162,000 π, time would be 2.7 hours, but that's not the case.

Wait, no, because the conveyor is adding 60,000 π per hour, so V(t) is 60,000 π * t.

But the volume of the cone is (1/3) π R² H, which with R=1.5 H is (1/3 π (2.25 H²)) H = 0.75 π H³. So V =0.75 π H³.

Set V =60,000 π t → 0.75 π H³ =60,000 π t → H³ = (60,000 /0.75) t =80,000 t.

So H = (80,000 t)^(1/3) → so to find t when H=100, H=100= (80,000 t)^(1/3). Cube both sides: 100^3=80,000 t → 1,000,000=80,000 t → t=1,000,000 /80,000 → 12.5 hours.

Wait, but in this calculation, the time is 12.5 hours. Looking at the options, option I is 12.6 h, which is very close. So that would suggest the answer is I, 12.6 h.

Wait, but I thought I made a mistake earlier when I thought the time to reach 60 ft was 2.7 hours, but that's when considering the conveyor rate. But the time I'm calculating now is the total time to reach 100 ft, which is 12.5 hours, which is option I.

But wait, let me check another approach. Let me consider the volume as a function of H. Since the volume is increasing at 60,000 π per hour, and the volume is also 0.75 π H³, then 60,000 π t = 0.75 π H³ → t= (0.75 H³ t)/60,000.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternative approach: Since the conveyor is adding 60,000 π ft³ per hour, and the volume of the pile is 0.75 π H³, then the height increases as H = (60,000 t /0.75)^(1/3).

So when H=100, t= (60,000 *100 /0.75)^(1/3) → 60,000 *100 is 6,000,000. 6,000,000 /0.75=8,000,000. So t=8,000,000^(1/3). The cube root of 8,000,000 is 200, because 200^3=8,000,000. So t=200 hours. Wait, that can't be right because that's much longer than any of the options.

Wait, that can't be correct because 200 hours is way more than 100 ft. I must have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go back.

Wait, if the conveyor is adding 60,000 π ft³ per hour, then V(t) =60,000 π t.

But the volume of the cone is (1/3)π R² H, where R=1.5 H → R²=2.25 H² → V= (1/3) π (2.25 H²) H =0.75 π H³.

Set V(t) =0.75 π H³ =60,000 π t → H^3 = (60,000 t) * (0.75 π) → Wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, 0.75 π H³ =60,000 π t → the π cancels, so 0.75 H³ =60,000 t → H³=60,000 t /0.75 =80,000 t → H= (80,000 t)^(1/3).

Wait, so when H=100, 100 = (80,000 t)^(1/3) → cube both sides: 1,000,000=80,000 t → t=1,000,000 /80,000 =12.5 hours. So that's 12.5 hours, which is 12.5 hours. So option I is 12.6 hours, which is the closest.

But why did I get 200 hours earlier? Oh, I think I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me correct.

Wait, 60,000 π t =0.75 π H³ → cancel π: 60,000 t =0.75 H³ → H³= (60,000 /0.75) t → 60,000 /0.75 is 80,000 → H³=80,000 t → H= (80,000 t)^(1/3).

So for H=100:

100 = (80,000 t)^(1/3) → cube both sides: 1,000,000 =80,000 t → t=1,000,000 /80,000 → 12.5 hours.

So correct time is 12.5 hours, which is option I (12.6 h, which is close enough).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the conveyor's rate. Maybe the conveyor's rate is 60,000 π ft³ per hour, so for each hour, 60,000 π ft³ is added. Let me make sure that the units are correct.

The problem says the conveyor carries ore at a rate of 60,000 π ft³ / hour. So that's 60,000 pi cubic feet per hour. So per hour, the volume increases by 60,000 pi ft³. So yes, that's correct.

So the time to reach 100 ft is 12.5 hours, which is option I.

To determine how long it will take for the pile of bauxite ore to reach the top of the silo, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Silo Dimensions**: The silo is a cylinder with a radius of 200 ft and a height of 100 ft. The ore forms a cone with a radius \( R = 1.5H \) and height \( H \), where \( H \) is the height of the cone.

2. **Volume of the Cone**: The volume of the cone is given by:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \pi R^2 H
   \]
   Substituting \( R = 1.5H \):
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (1.5H)^2 H = \frac{1}{3} \pi (2.25H^2) H = 0.75 \pi H^3
   \]

3. **Rate of Volume Increase**: The conveyor carries ore at a rate of \( 60,000 \pi \, \text{ft}^3/\text{hour} \). Thus, the volume of ore as a function of time is:
   \[
   V(t) = 60,000 \pi t
   \]

4. **Equating the Two Expressions for Volume**: At any time \( t \), the volume of the cone is:
   \[
   V(t) = 0.75 \pi H^3
   \]
   Equating this to the volume from the conveyor:
   \[
   60,000 \pi t = 0.75 \pi H^3
   \]
   Canceling \( \pi \) and solving for \( H \):
   \[
   60,000 t = 0.75 H^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad H^3 = 80,000 t \quad \Rightarrow \quad H = (80,000 t)^{1/3}
   \]

5. **Time to Reach the Top**: The silo is 100 ft tall, so we set \( H = 100 \) ft and solve for \( t \):
   \[
   100 = (80,000 t)^{1/3}
   \]
   Cubing both sides:
   \[
   100^3 = 80,000 t \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1,000,000 = 80,000 t \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{1,000,000}{80,000} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}
   \]

6. **Answer Selection**: The closest option to 12.5 hours is **12.6 hours (I)**.
