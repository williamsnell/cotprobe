Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 110 plus 70. Hmm, let me think about how to solve this. I'm a bit rusty, but I should be able to handle it. 

Alright, adding two numbers together. The numbers are 110 and 70. Let me visualize them. 110 is one hundred ten, and 70 is seven tens. So, if I add them up, maybe I can break it down. 

Wait, another way to think about it is line them up properly. So, 110 has three digits, and 70 has two. I'll write them like this:

```
 110
+70
```

Adding the units place first. 0 plus 0 is 0. Then the tens place: 1 plus 7 is 8. And the hundreds place: 1 plus 0 is 1. So putting it together, it's 180. 

Wait, let me check if I did that right. 100 + 70 is 170, and then the remaining 10 makes it 180. Yeah, that makes sense. So the sum is 180. 

Looking at the options, option J is 180. So that's the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The addition seems straightforward. Another way to think about it is that 110 is 100 + 10, and 70 is just 70. Adding 100 and 70 gives 170, then adding the extra 10 gives 180. Yep, that's consistent. 

So, the answer should be J: 180.
