Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about whether substances behave as ideal gases under certain conditions. Hmm, I remember that the ideal gas law applies when a substance is a good approximation of a gas, meaning the volume is much larger than the molecules' volumes, and the temperature is not too high. Let me think through each part.

The question has three parts: a, b, and c. Each has a substance and its conditions. I need to determine if each is a reasonable assumption of an ideal gas.

Starting with part a) Oxygen at 30°C and 1.0 MPa. Oxygen's boiling point is around 154°C, right? So at 30°C, which is much lower than the boiling point, so it's definitely in the gas phase. But I think the ideal gas assumption is more applicable when the gas is ideal, which requires that the pressure is not too high. Wait, but wait, at 1 MPa (which is 10 bar), that's pretty high pressure. The critical point for oxygen is around 154°C and 5.2 MPa. So at 30°C and 1 MPa, the pressure is way below the critical point, but is it low enough? I think the ideal gas approximation is okay when the pressure is below about 300 kPa (0.3 MPa) or something. Since 1 MPa is higher, maybe it's not ideal. Alternatively, the ideal gas law is more valid at lower pressures, so maybe it's reasonable. I'm a bit unsure here.

Wait, another point: the ideal gas assumption is more about the molecules' behavior. At high pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes significant. Oh, right, the ideal gas law is a simplification that requires that the volume of the gas molecules is negligible compared to the container volume. So at high pressures, this might not hold. But at low pressures, like 1 MPa is 10^6 Pa, the gas molecules' volume compared to the container is much smaller. So maybe oxygen at 1 MPa is a good approximation. Hmm, but sometimes people still use the ideal gas law for pressures above the critical point. Wait, no, the critical point is the point beyond which the substance can't be liquefied. So if the pressure is below critical, it can be treated as an ideal gas. So 1 MPa is way below critical (5.2 MPa), so it's reasonable to assume it's an ideal gas. So for part a, I think it's reasonable.

Moving to part b) Nitrogen at -100°C and 10 MPa. Nitrogen's boiling point is around 77°C. So at -100°C, which is way below the boiling point, so it's definitely in the gas phase. But now, the pressure is 10 MPa, which is quite high. The critical pressure for nitrogen is about 3.3 MPa. So since 10 MPa is way above that, this might not be ideal. Because the ideal gas assumption holds only up to the critical pressure. So at higher pressures, the gas isn't ideal. So the assumption that it's an ideal gas isn't reasonable. So part b) is not reasonable.

Now part c) Water at 40°C and 10 kPa. Water boils at 100°C at standard pressure (100 kPa). So at 40°C, which is below the boiling point, the water is in the liquid phase. But wait, at 10 kPa and 40°C, the water is definitely in the liquid phase (since 40 < 100). But water is a liquid, and the ideal gas assumption isn't valid for liquids. So it's definitely not an ideal gas. Because ideal gases are only applicable to gases, not liquids or solids. So part c) is not reasonable.

Wait, but wait. The question is about whether it's reasonable to assume the substance behaves as an ideal gas under the given conditions. So for part c, water is a liquid, so definitely not behaving as an ideal gas.

So putting it all together: 

a) Oxygen: Reasonable.

b) Nitrogen: Not reasonable.

c) Water: Not reasonable.

Looking at the options:

Option A says a) Reasonable, b) Not, c) Reasonable. That's wrong because c is wrong.

Option D: a) Reasonable, b) Reasonable, c) Reasonable. But wait, b and c are wrong. So D is incorrect.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer should be one where a) is correct, but b and c are wrong.

Wait, the options are:

A: a) Reasonable, b) Not, c) Reasonable.

B: a) No, b) Reasonable, c) Reasonable.

C: a) No, b) No, c) Reasonable.

D: a) Reasonable, b) Reasonable, c) Reasonable.

E: a) No, b) No, c) No.

F: a) Reasonable, b) No, c) No.

G: a) Reasonable, b) Reasonable, c) No.

H: a) No, b) Reasonable, c) No.

Wait, no, what's each option.

Looking for a) Reasonable, b) Not, c) Not.

Looking at the options:

Looking at option G: a) is Reasonable, b) is Reasonable, c) is Not. No, c) is Not.

Wait, looking for part a) Reasonable, b) Not, c) Not.

Looking at the options, option F says a) Reasonable, b) Not, c) Not.

Yes, option F is a) Reasonable, b) Not, c) Not. So the correct answer is F.

To determine whether each substance behaves as an ideal gas under the given conditions, we evaluate each part based on the assumptions of the ideal gas law:

1. **Part a) Oxygen at 30°C and 1.0 MPa**:  
   - Oxygen has a boiling point of ~154°C, so at 30°C (much lower), it is in the gas phase.  
   - The pressure of 1.0 MPa (10 bar) is well below the critical pressure of oxygen (~5.2 MPa), so the ideal gas assumption is reasonable.  
   - **Conclusion**: Oxygen is a reasonable assumption of an ideal gas.

2. **Part b) Nitrogen at -100°C and 10 MPa**:  
   - Nitrogen has a boiling point of ~77°C, so at -100°C (much lower), it is in the gas phase.  
   - The pressure of 10 MPa is significantly above the critical pressure of nitrogen (~3.3 MPa), meaning the ideal gas assumption is not valid at such high pressures.  
   - **Conclusion**: Nitrogen is not a reasonable assumption of an ideal gas.

3. **Part c) Water at 40°C and 10 kPa**:  
   - Water boils at 100°C at standard pressure, so at 40°C, it is in the liquid phase.  
   - The ideal gas assumption is only valid for gases, and water is a liquid.  
   - **Conclusion**: Water is not a reasonable assumption of an ideal gas.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **F**, where oxygen is reasonable, nitrogen is not, and water is not.
