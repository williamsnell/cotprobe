Okay, I'm trying to find the curvature of the function f(x) = sqrt(4x - x²) at x=2. Hmm, I remember that curvature has a formula involving the first and second derivatives. Let me think about the steps I need to take.

First, I should probably find the first derivative, f'(x). The function is sqrt(4x - x²), which is the same as (4x -x²)^(1/2). Using the chain rule, the derivative would be (1/2)(4x - x²)^(-1/2) multiplied by the derivative of the inside, which is 4 - 2x. So f'(x) = (4 - 2x)/(2*sqrt(4x - x²)).

Wait, can I simplify that? Let's see, 4-2x is 2(2 - x), so numerator becomes 2(2 - x) and denominator is 2*sqrt(...). The 2s cancel out, so f'(x) = (2 - x)/sqrt(4x -x²).

Next, I need the second derivative, f''(x). To find that, I'll have to differentiate f'(x). So f'(x) is (2 - x) multiplied by (4x -x²)^(-1/2). I can use the product rule here. Let me set u = (2 - x) and v = (4x -x²)^(-1/2).

The derivative of u is -1. The derivative of v is (-1/2)(4x -x²)^(-3/2)*(4 - 2x) by the chain rule. So putting it together, f''(x) is u'v + uv'.

So f''(x) = (-1)(4x -x²)^(-1/2) + (2 - x)*(-1/2)(4 - 2x)(4x -x²)^(-3/2).

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me factor out (4x -x²)^(-3/2). Wait, wait, maybe I can factor out (4x -x²)^(-3/2) to simplify. Let me see: 

First term: (-1)(4x -x²)^(-1/2) = (-1)(4x -x²)^(-1/2) * [ (4x -x²)^(-1/2) * (4x -x²) ) ] / (4x -x²)

Wait, maybe an alternative approach. Let me compute each part step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I'll plug in x=2 into f'(x) and f''(x) early on to see if things simplify.

So, x=2. Let's compute f'(2):

f'(2) = (2 - 2)/sqrt(8 -4) = 0/2 = 0. So the first derivative at x=2 is zero.

Now, f''(2). Wait, but since f'(2) is zero, let's plug x=2 into f''(x). Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute f''(x) in terms of x and then plug x=2.

Wait, but since f'(2)=0, when we compute f''(x) at x=2, maybe there's some simplification. Let's proceed.

Compute f''(x):

f''(x) = (-1)(4x -x²)^(-1/2) + (2 -x)*(-1/2)(4-2x)(4x -x²)^(-3/2)

Wait, plugging x=2 into this:

First term: (-1)(8 -4)^(-1/2) = (-1)(4)^(-1/2) = (-1)/(2) = -0.5.

Second term: (2 - 2) * (-1/2)(4-4)(8 -4)^(-3/2) → (0)* something = 0.

So f''(2) is -0.5.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it properly.

Wait, (2 -x) is zero when x=2, so the second term becomes zero. So f''(2) = -0.5.

Now, to find curvature, the formula is κ = |f''(x)| / [1 + (f'(x))^2 ]^(3/2).

At x=2, f'(x)=0, so denominator becomes [1 + 0]^3/2 = 1. So κ = |f''(2)| / 1 = |-0.5| = 0.5.

So the curvature at x=2 is 0.5, which is option C.

To find the curvature of the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{4x - x^2} \) at \( x = 2 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **First Derivative**:  
   \( f(x) = (4x - x^2)^{1/2} \).  
   Using the chain rule:  
   \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}(4x - x^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (4 - 2x) \).  
   Simplifying:  
   \( f'(x) = \frac{2 - x}{\sqrt{4x - x^2}} \).

2. **Second Derivative**:  
   Differentiate \( f'(x) \) using the product rule:  
   \( f'(x) = u \cdot v \), where \( u = (2 - x) \) and \( v = (4x - x^2)^{-1/2} \).  
   \( u' = -1 \), \( v' = -\frac{1}{2}(4x - x^2)^{-3/2}(4 - 2x) \).  
   Thus,  
   \( f''(x) = u'v + uv' = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{4x - x^2}} + (2 - x)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{4 - 2x}{(4x - x^2)^{3/2}} \).

3. **Evaluate at \( x = 2 \)**:  
   - \( f'(2) = \frac{2 - 2}{\sqrt{8 - 4}} = 0 \).  
   - \( f''(2) = -\frac{1}{2} + 0 = -\frac{1}{2} \).

4. **Curvature Formula**:  
   \( \kappa = \frac{|f''(x)|}{\left(1 + (f'(x))^2\right)^{3/2}} \).  
   At \( x = 2 \):  
   \( \kappa = \frac{|-0.5|}{1} = 0.5 \).

Thus, the curvature at \( x = 2 \) is **0.5**.
