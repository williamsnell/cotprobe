Okay, so I have this calculus problem here. Let me read it again. It says: What's the value of 'a' greater than zero such that the tangent line to the graph of f(x) = x² e^(-x) at x = a passes through the origin. The options are given from A to J, with J being 0, which I know isn't valid since a has to be positive.

Hmm, so I need to find the value of 'a' where the tangent line at that point goes through (0,0). I remember that a tangent line at a point has a certain slope, and it's defined by the derivative of the function at that point. So first, I should find the derivative of f(x).

Wait, f(x) is x² multiplied by e^(-x). So to find f'(x), I'll need to use the product rule. The product rule says that the derivative of u*v is u’v + uv’. Here, u is x², so u’ is 2x. v is e^(-x), so v’ is -e^(-x). So putting it together:

f'(x) = 2x e^(-x) + x² (-e^(-x)) 
= e^(-x) (2x - x²)
= x e^(-x) (2 - x).

Wait, because I can factor out an x and e^(-x). So f'(x) is x e^(-x) (2 - x). That's the slope of the tangent line at any x.

Now, the tangent line at x=a has slope m = f'(a) = a e^(-a) (2 - a). 

The equation of the tangent line at x=a is given by:

y = f(a) + m (x - a).

So f(a) is a² e^(-a). And m is a e^(-a) (2 - a). So the equation becomes:

y = a² e^(-a) + [ a e^(-a) (2 - a) ] (x - a).

I need this line to pass through the origin (0,0). So plugging x =0 and y=0 into the equation:

0 = a² e^(-a) + [ a e^(-a) (2 - a) ] (0 - a).

Simplify that:

0 = a² e^(-a) + [ a e^(-a) (2 - a) ] (-a).

Let me compute the second term:

[ a e^(-a) (2 - a) ] * (-a) = -a² e^(-a) (2 - a).

So the equation becomes:

0 = a² e^(-a) - a² e^(-a) (2 - a).

Factor out a² e^(-a):

0 = a² e^(-a) [1 - (2 - a)] 
= a² e^(-a) (1 - 2 + a)
= a² e^(-a) (a -1).

So 0 = a² e^(-a) (a -1).

But wait, e^(-a) is always positive and a² is positive since a is positive. Therefore, the only term that can be zero is (a -1). So a -1 =0 → a=1.

Wait, that's quick. So a=1. But let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in the algebra? Let me go through each step again.

So substituting x=0 and y=0:

0 = a² e^(-a) + [ a e^(-a) (2 - a) ] (0 - a).

Which becomes 0 = a² e^(-a) - a² e^(-a) (2 - a).

Factor a² e^(-a):

a² e^(-a) [1 - (2 -a)] = a² e^(-a) (a -1).

Set to zero: (a-1) must be zero, so a=1.

So the correct a is 1. Looking at the options, option E is 1. So the answer should be E.

The value of 'a' is found by setting the tangent line at x = a to pass through the origin. Using the product rule and solving the equation, we find that a = 1.

Answer: E
