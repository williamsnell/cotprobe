Okay, so I've got this question about unions, specifically comparing craft unions and industrial unions. Hmm, I remember unions are groups of workers who go to unions to talk about their rights. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details between the two.

Let me think about each option. The question is asking how they differ. So I need to find the correct option that says these are the main differences.

Option A: It says industrial unions require higher education, while craft unions don't. I think that's not right. I remember hearing that unions are often more inclusive, but maybe not that high on educational requirements. Or perhaps that's not a standard point. I'm not sure.

Option B: Craft unions join workers with a particular skill, industrial unions with a particular plant or industry. Wait, I've heard that. Like, a craft union might focus on a specific trade or skill, so members have that expertise. Whereas an industrial union might span multiple industries. So this sounds correct. That's one point.

Option C: Says craft unions are for skilled workers, industrial for unskilled. That seems more accurate. I think that's right because skilled workers are more likely to join a union for their expertise, while unskilled might need more guidance.

Option D: Craft unions include workers from multiple industries, industrial specific to one. That feels correct too. Because a craft union might be for a specific trade, like carpentry, so they're in a particular industry. Industrial unions are in a specific plant or industry, so they're focused on one area.

Wait, but the question is about what's different between the two. So the options are A to J. Let me read each again.

Option D says: Craft unions include workers from multiple industries, industrial unions are specific to one. That's correct because a craft union might cover several trades, while industrial unions are for a single industry.

Wait, but what about option B? B says craft unions join with a particular skill, industrial join with a plant. Is that the main difference? Or are these aspects of the unions' functions.

Wait, the question is about how they're different, not the functions. So the main difference would be in their membership criteria or focus. So the options comparing membership criteria.

So option B says that. Craft unions are for workers with a particular skill, while industrial unions are for workers in a particular plant or industry. That seems to capture the essence of their focus.

Option D is also correct because it's about the types of unions. Craft unions are for multiple industries (as in option D), while industrial unions are specific to one. So both D and B are correct points.

Wait, but I thought the question is asking which is correct. So the options are independent, but the question is which statement correctly describes the differences.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, each making a statement. So the correct answer is the one that accurately describes the differences between craft and industrial unions.

Option D says that craft unions include workers from multiple industries, industrial unions are specific. That's correct because, for example, a carpentry union might include people from various trades within the same industry (like framing, carpentry, etc.), whereas an industrial union would be only for one plant, making them specific to that industry.

Option B says that. So both D and B are correct? But wait, the options are separate. Let me re-read the question.

The question is, "How are craft unions different from industrial unions?" So the answer options each present a different way of saying that.

So which one is correct? Let me think again.

Option D's point is about the scope of the unions. Craft unions cover multiple industries, whereas industrial unions are specific. That's a clear difference.

Option B's point is about their focus. Craft unions focus on a particular skill (like carpentry), while industrial unions focus on a specific plant or industry. So that's another point of difference.

Wait, but the question is about the differences, not the focus. So which option correctly states the primary difference.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the definitions.

Industrial unions are typically larger and focus on specific industries, like manufacturing. Craft unions, on the other hand, are more about specific trades or skills. So the main difference is that industrial unions are more about a single industry or plant, while craft unions are about a specific skill or trade.

So looking at the options, option B says that: "Craft unions join together workers with one particular skill, while industrial unions include workers in a particular plant or industry." Yes, that's a correct statement.

Option D says that: "Craft unions are smaller than industrial unions." Wait, that's not necessarily true. Craft unions can be large, like in a specific trade.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which option is correct. Let's go through each option again.

Option A: Industrial unions require higher education; craft unions don't. So that's not correct. I don't think that's a standard fact.

Option B: Correct as per earlier.

Option C: Skilled vs unskilled. That's correct.

But the question is asking about how they're different, not the type of members. So which option correctly describes the difference in focus.

So option B is about the composition (skill vs. industry), and option C is about the type (skilled vs. unskilled). But the question is about the difference between the unions themselves.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about their functions. So the main difference would be that industrial unions are for specific industries, while craft unions are for specific trades. So option D is correct.

Alternatively, option B is about their focus areas. For example, industrial unions are more about the mechanics of production, while craft unions are about the tools and techniques used.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the question is about how the unions differ, not the composition. So D says that craft unions are for multiple industries, while industrial unions are specific to one.

Alternatively, option B says that craft unions join with a particular skill, while industrial unions join with a particular plant or industry. So both D and B are correct points.

Wait, but I think the question is asking for the correct differences, so the best answer is D.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of them as types. So the main difference is that industrial unions focus on a specific plant or industry, while craft unions are for a specific skill or trade. So option D is correct.

Alternatively, option B says that. So both B and D are correct statements, but the question is which is the best answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer is either D or B.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Because, for example, an industrial union in a plant might focus on the mechanics of that plant, while a craft union could focus on a specific trade within that plant. So the unions are focused on different areas.

Wait, but the question is about how they are different. So the primary difference would be the focus of the unions.

So option B says that. So that's the correct answer.

Alternatively, option D's point is about the types of unions. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see the options again.

The correct answer is D because it states that craft unions include workers from multiple industries, while industrial unions are specific to one. That's a clear difference.

But another option is B, which says that craft unions join with a particular skill, while industrial unions join with a particular plant or industry.

So both B and D are correct statements, but the question is which one is correct.

Wait, the question is about how they are different. So the correct answer is either B or D.

I think the correct answer is D because it's about the types of unions. Craft unions are broader, covering multiple industries, while industrial unions are specific to one. So that's the correct difference.
