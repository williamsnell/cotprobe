Okay, so I need to find the book value per share for ABC Corporation. Let's see, I remember that book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing that amount by the number of outstanding shares. 

Wait, the formula is something like (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) divided by the number of shares. So in this case, the total assets are $75,000 and the total liabilities are $52,000. Let me do the math first. 

Subtracting liabilities from assets: 75,000 minus 52,000. Let me calculate that. 75,000 minus 52,000 is 23,000. So the book value of the company is $23,000. But wait, that's just the book value. I need to find the per share value, so I have to divide that by the number of shares outstanding. The problem states there are 500 shares. So I take 23,000 and divide by 500.

Let me do the division. 23,000 divided by 500. Hmm, 500 goes into 23,000 how many times? Well, 500 times 46 is 23,000. Because 500 * 40 is 20,000, and 500*6 is 3,000. So 40+6=46. So 46. So the book value per share is $46. Looking at the options, option H is $46 per share. So the answer should be H.

To determine the book value per share, subtract total liabilities from total assets to find the book value, then divide by the number of shares:

1. Total Assets = $75,000
2. Total Liabilities = $52,000
3. Book Value = $75,000 - $52,000 = $23,000
4. Shares outstanding = 500
5. Book Value per Share = $23,000 / 500 = $46

The correct answer is **H: $46 per share**.

Answer: H
