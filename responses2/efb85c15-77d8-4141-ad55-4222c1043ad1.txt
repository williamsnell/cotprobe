Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about the equilibrium frequency of the Tay-Sachs gene in the Jewish population of New York City. Hmm, I remember that Tay-Sachs is a recessive X-linked disorder, right? So it's passed from the mother to the daughters and from the mother to the sons.

The question gives some numbers: the frequency in New York City is 0.015, and about 0.0015 in non-Jewish individuals. Wait, but the question says "under the combined effects of mutation and selection," so maybe it's about the equilibrium, not just the Hardy-Weinberg numbers.

The selection coefficient is 1, and the forward mutation rate is 1e-6. Wait, wait, selection coefficients are usually between 0 and 1. Oh, but here it's given as 1. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, perhaps the selection coefficient is actually the selection against the recessive allele, so maybe it's 1 for the favored allele and 1 for the recessive. But I'm not sure.

I think the problem is about equilibrium in a population under selection and mutation. The Hardy-Weinberg model usually assumes random mating, but here selection and mutation are acting on the gene. The equilibrium frequency would depend on these forces.

The equilibrium frequency under selection and mutation can be tricky. I remember in some cases, the equilibrium for a recessive disease (like this) is when the mutation rate equals the selection pressure on the carrier. Or wait, maybe the mutation rate is the rate at which carriers (heterozygotes) become affected, but I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Let me think about the formula for equilibrium. The formula for the equilibrium frequency (q) of a recessive allele under selection and mutation is q = μ / s, where μ is the mutation rate and s is the selection coefficient against the homozygote. Wait, no, that's not right. Or perhaps it's the other way around. 

Alternatively, in the case of a dominant lethal allele, the equilibrium is when the mutation rate equals the selection coefficient. But wait, in the case of a recessive allele, the selection against it is s, and the mutation rate is the rate at which carriers (heterozygotes) convert into affected individuals. So maybe the equilibrium occurs when the mutation rate equals the selection coefficient.

Wait, one more thought: the equilibrium for a recessive allele's frequency in a population where selection is acting against it and mutation is introducing the allele is when the mutation rate equals the selection coefficient. So q_eq = μ / s. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: The equilibrium occurs when the rate at which the allele is lost due to selection equals the rate at which it is introduced (by mutation). So, the allele's frequency doesn't change much over generation.

The selection against the homozygote (since the disease is recessive) would cause the allele frequency to decrease. The mutation rate would increase the allele frequency. At equilibrium, these rates balance.

The formula I think is q_eq = μ / (1 - s), where s is the selection coefficient against the homozygote. But wait, in this problem, the selection coefficient is 1. Oh, because s is the coefficient against the homozygote, so if s is 1, that would make the denominator zero, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, maybe s is the selection coefficient against the heterozygote. No, the disease is recessive, so it's the homozygote that's affected. So s would be the selection coefficient against the homozygote.

Wait, the selection coefficient s is the fitness cost. So, for a recessive allele, if it's present, the fitness is reduced. So the fitness of the homozygote is 1 - s. But in our case, s is given as 1. So fitness is zero for the homozygote. That's a problem because if the homozygote has zero fitness, selection would eliminate them, and the frequency of the allele would drop to zero. But that can't be right because the question is about the equilibrium.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the selection coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the selection coefficient is the relative fitness of the heterozygote compared to the homozygote. But in this case, the disease is recessive, so the heterozygote is actually a carrier. So, for a recessive disease, the heterozygote has fitness 1 (they are carriers), and the homozygote has fitness 0. So s would be the selection against the homozygote, which would be 1. So the fitness of the homozygote is 0, so the population would have no individuals with the disease.

But that can't be the situation. So the problem must be using s as something else. Alternatively, perhaps the selection coefficient is given as 1, which would mean that the fitness of the affected carriers is zero. But that would imply that the disease is lethal, but for a recessive allele, that would mean that the heterozygotes are not affected. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the disease is recessive.

Wait, maybe I should think about the selection coefficient as the fitness cost of the affected allele. So perhaps the selection coefficient is for the heterozygote compared to the wildtype. But for a recessive allele, the heterozygote is a carrier, so their fitness is 1. The homozygote has fitness 0. So the selection coefficient (heterozygote fitness) is 0 relative to the homozygote. So s = 0.

But the question says the selection coefficient is 1. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think again.

Wait, another approach. The equilibrium frequency of an allele under selection and mutation. The formula I remember for a recessive allele is q_eq = μ / (s), assuming that s is the selection coefficient against the homozygote.

Wait, s is the selection coefficient against the homozygote. If s is 1, that would mean the homozygote's fitness is 0. So, the equilibrium frequency would be zero. But that's not the case in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Another source I remember says that the equilibrium is when the mutation rate equals the selection coefficient. So μ = s. So in that case, the equilibrium q (homozygous) would be μ/(s) = 1, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is q_eq = μ / (s * (1 - s)) ), but if s is 1, again denominator is zero. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the equilibrium q is given by μ/(s). Since s is 1, this would give q = μ, which is 1e-6 in this case. Looking at the options, option C is 1e-6, but that's just the mutation rate. But the question is about the equilibrium frequency, which may be different.

Wait, another thought: the selection coefficient s is the fitness cost. So if the disease is recessive, each affected individual has fitness zero (they died). The selection coefficient s is 1, so the homozygote's fitness is zero (s=1). So for a recessive allele, the heterozygote has fitness 1, and the homozygote 0. But then, the frequency of the homozygote is zero, so the allele's frequency can't go up. So the equilibrium must be zero. But that's not one of the options except for E (0.00001) which is 1e-5.

Wait, perhaps the question is misstated. Alternatively, perhaps the selection coefficient is the fitness advantage, but that's not standard.

Wait, the problem states that the frequency in the Jewish population is 0.015, and non-Jewish is 0.0015. So the Jewish population's equilibrium is 0.015, but we're to find the equilibrium under mutation and selection, which might be a different value. Or perhaps the given numbers are for the equilibrium with other factors.

Wait, but the question says the selection coefficient is 1 and forward mutation rate is 1e-6. So the equilibrium might be when μ equals the selection coefficient, but if s is 1, then μ is 1e-6, so q would be that. Let me think about that.

Wait no, maybe the formula is q = μ / (1 - s). But with s =1, denominator is zero, which gives infinite q, which is impossible. So that approach can't be right.

Another approach: The standard formula for the equilibrium frequency of a recessive allele under mutation and selection is q_eq = μ / (1 - s). But if s is 1, then denominator is zero. So perhaps s is not 1 in this context.

Wait, perhaps the selection coefficient is the relative fitness of the affected allele. So for the homozygote, their fitness is 1 - s, and the heterozygote is 1. If s is 1, then the homozygote has fitness 0, so selection is complete for homozygotes. But that's not the case here. The problem says the selection coefficient is 1, which usually implies complete selection.

Wait, but the question says the selection coefficient is 1 and the forward mutation rate is 1e-6. So perhaps the mutation rate is the rate at which the allele is lost from the population. So if mutation rate is μ, then each generation, each allele has a μ chance of being lost. So if the allele is in the population, the equilibrium would be when the loss due to mutation equals the loss due to selection.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the equilibrium equations.

The equilibrium condition under mutation and selection for a recessive allele would be when the number of new mutations entering the population equals the number of alleles lost due to selection.

In a diploid population, the genotype frequencies under selection are:

p^2 (homozygous): fitness w1

2p(1-p): heterozygote: fitness w2

q^2 (homozygous): fitness w3.

But in this case, the disease is recessive, so the affected carriers (heterozygotes) do not show the disease. So their fitness is 1 (or perhaps 0, depending on how it's modeled).

Wait, perhaps in standard selection models, the fitness for the affected is 0, and the heterozygote has fitness 1.

But in this scenario, the selection coefficient is given as 1. So the fitness of the homozygotes is 0, and the heterozygotes are 1.

In a diploid selection model, the genotype frequencies after selection would be:

p^2 (homozygotes): (p^2) / (p^2 * 1 + 2p q *1 + q^2 *0) ) = p^2 / (p^2 + 2 p q) ) = p^2 / (p + q)^2 (since q=1-p)

Wait, but wait: the heterozygotes have fitness 1, and the homozygotes 0.

So the total fitness is sum of (frequency * fitness):

= p^2 * 0 + 2 p q *1 + q^2 *0 = 2 p q.

So the adjusted genotype frequencies are:

homozygotes: (p^2 * 0) / (2 p q) )= 0.

heterozygotes: (2 p q *1 ) / (2 p q) )=1.

So the new population is composed mostly of heterozygotes (q^2 is negligible), but that can't be right because under selection, the carriers (heterozygotes) have a fitness of 1, and the homozygotes have 0. So the heterozygotes will increase in proportion.

Wait, but in the standard selection model for a recessive allele, the selection is against the carriers. So the heterozygotes have higher fitness.

So let's model the selection as such.

The selection process would result in the heterozygotes having a higher fitness.

In the absence of selection, the genotype frequencies would be p^2 (homozygote), 2 p q (heterozygote), q^2 (homozygote).

After selection, their frequencies are:

p^2/(p^2 + 2 p q + q^2) * 0 (homozygote) +

2 p q/(p^2 + 2 p q + q^2) *1 (heterozygote) +

q^2/(p^2 + 2 p q + q^2) *0 (homozygote) =

So the heterozygotes become 2 p q / (1), since p^2 + q^2 + 2 p q = (p + q)^2 =1.

So after selection, the heterozygote frequency is 2 p q, and the homozygote frequencies are zero.

But in reality, with selection, the heterozygotes have higher fitness, so the allele's frequency in the next generation increases.

Wait, but the question is about the equilibrium frequency, which under mutation and selection would be when the allele's frequency doesn't change.

So, the equilibrium occurs when the allele is maintained at a frequency because the loss due to selection equals the gain due to mutation.

Let me think about the mutation process. Mutation introduces the allele into the population. So each generation, some fraction μ of the alleles are lost (i.e., mutate and become non-functional). If the allele's frequency is q, then the loss due to mutation is μ q (since each allele has a μ chance of mutating into the recessive allele, I guess).

Wait no, wait. The mutation rate is the rate at which the allele is introduced. So if the allele's frequency is q, then the rate at which it's lost is μ per allele. So the loss rate is μ q.

But for a recessive allele, loss due to mutation is μ q, and loss due to selection is s q (where s is the selection coefficient against the carrier, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection coefficient is the fitness cost, so for the homozygote, their fitness is 1 - s.

Wait, if s is the selection coefficient against the homozygote, then the fitness of the heterozygote is 1, and the homozygote is 1 - s.

So in this scenario, the selection coefficient s is 1, but that would make the heterozygote's fitness 1 and the homozygote's fitness 0. But the selection coefficient for the heterozygote is perhaps 0, but the question says s is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the selection coefficient for the heterozygote with the homozygote. Alternatively, perhaps the selection coefficient is the relative fitness of the affected allele, meaning that the affected carriers have fitness 1 - s, and the carriers of the other allele have fitness 1.

No, this is getting too confusing. Let's perhaps try a different approach. Let's model the allele's frequency after selection and mutation.

Suppose the current frequency is q. We want to find the equilibrium where q doesn't change after selection and mutation.

The allele's frequency after selection is q' = [ (2 p q ) * (1) + (q^2) * (0) ) * p ] / [ (2 p q) * p + (q^2) * p ) ] Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, no. The standard selection model for a recessive allele is:

The fitness of the heterozygote is 1, and the homozygote is 0. The genotype frequencies after selection (proportional to fitness) are:

p^2 * 0 + 2 p q *1 + q^2 * 0 → 2 p q.

So the allele's frequency after selection is (2 p q ) / (2 p q) ) =1, but that can't be right because the allele's frequency would be 100% after selection, which isn't possible. Wait, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, the sum of the fitnesses is 2 p q * (1) + p^2 * 0 + q^2 *0 = 2 p q.

The allele's frequency after selection is (2 p q *1 + 0) / (2 p q) ) = 1, which is impossible because you can't have an allele frequency of 1 when the other allele is also present.

Wait, no, that can't be right. I must be getting the model wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the allele's frequency in the next generation after selection is given by:

q' = (frequency of the allele in the selected population) / (sum of all allele contributions after selection).

So after selection, the heterozygotes have fitness 1, and the homozygotes 0.

The sum of fitness for each allele:

Each heterozygote has 2 alleles, so the total is 2 * 1 * 2 p q (since each heterozygote contributes one allele to each parent, but perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, the frequency of the allele after selection is:

q' = (2 p q * 1) / (2 p q * 1 + p^2 * 0 + q^2 * 0) ) * [1 / (2 p + q)].

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the allele frequency after selection, considering the fitness of each genotype.

The allele frequency after selection is:

q' = [ (frequency of heterozygotes * their fitness) + (frequency of homozygotes * their fitness) ) ] / [ total fitness ]

The frequency of the allele in the population after selection is proportional to the allele's contribution to the next generation.

But this is getting really complicated. Maybe I should look for a formula that describes the equilibrium frequency.

In a model where a recessive allele is subject to mutation and selection, the equilibrium frequency q_eq is given by q_eq = μ / (s), where s is the selection coefficient against the homozygote. But if s is 1, this gives μ as q_eq, which is 1e-6. But that's one of the options (C). But the question is about the equilibrium in the presence of mutation and selection, so perhaps that's the answer.

Wait, but if the selection coefficient is 1, then the formula suggests q_eq is μ, which is 1e-6. So the equilibrium frequency is 0.00001, which is option E?

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1e-6, and option E is 1e-5. Hmm. So according to this formula, the equilibrium would be μ/(1) = μ = 1e-6, so option C.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because the formula assumes that the selection coefficient is the fitness cost of the allele, but in some cases, it's the fitness cost of the genotype.

Wait, another way: The equilibrium frequency of a mutation under selection is μ = s * q_eq. So if s is 1, then μ = q_eq. So q_eq is 1e-6.

But the given options don't have 1e-6. Wait, no, option C is 1e-6. Oh wait, no, the problem's options are:

A) 1e-7

B) 1e-8

C) 1e-6

D) 1e-5

E) 1e-4

Wait, no, the problem's options are:

A) 0.0001 (1e-5)

B) 0.00001 (1e-6)

C) 0.000001 (1e-7)

D) 0.0000001 (1e-8)

E) 0.00000001 (1e-9)

Wait, no, in the problem, the given options are:

A) 1e-7

B) 1e-8

C) 1e-6

D) 1e-5

E) 1e-4

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. The given options are:

A) 0.0001 (1e-5)

B) 0.00001 (1e-6)

C) 0.000001 (1e-7)

D) 0.0000001 (1e-8)

E) 0.00000001 (1e-9)

Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem statement says the options are:

A) 1e-7

B) 1e-8

C) 1e-6

D) 1e-5

E) 1e-4

Wait, but the question is about the equilibrium frequency of the allele, which under mutation and selection is given by the formula q_eq = μ / (1 - s). But if s is 1, this is undefined.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is q_eq = μ / s. If μ is 1e-6 and s is 1, then q_eq is 1e-6. But that's option C.

Wait, but in the problem, the selection coefficient is 1 and the mutation rate is 1e-6. So with s=1, the formula predicts q_eq=μ=1e-6, which is option C.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure if the formula is correct. Another way to think about it: The mutation rate adds alleles to the population, while selection removes them. The equilibrium is when the loss due to selection equals the gain due to mutation.

If the selection coefficient is 1, meaning that the loss rate is equal to the gain rate, then the allele reaches its equilibrium frequency. So if the mutation rate μ is 1e-6, the equilibrium frequency would be μ, which is 1e-6.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C: 1e-6.

The question involves determining the equilibrium frequency of a recessive allele in a population, considering both mutation and selection. The given parameters are:

- Mutation rate (μ) = \(1 \times 10^{-6}\)
- Selection coefficient (s) = \(1\)

### Key Analysis:
1. **Selection Coefficient (s):**  
   The selection coefficient is given as \(s = 1\), which implies that the fitness cost of the homozygote is equal to the fitness advantage of the heterozygote. This means that the heterozygotes have the same fitness as the homozygotes, and the homozygotes have zero fitness. However, this interpretation leads to a contradiction because the frequency of the allele cannot be determined if the fitness of the homozygote is zero.

2. **Mutation Rate (μ):**  
   The mutation rate is the rate at which alleles are introduced into the population. Here, the mutation rate is \(1 \times 10^{-6}\), meaning that one allele is lost from the population for every million alleles.

3. **Equilibrium Frequency (q_eq):**  
   The equilibrium frequency of an allele under mutation and selection can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   q_{\text{eq}} = \frac{\mu}{s}
   \]
   Substituting the given values (\(\mu = 1 \times 10^{-6}\) and \(s = 1\)):
   \[
   q_{\text{eq}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-6}}{1} = 1 \times 10^{-6}
   \]
   Thus, the equilibrium frequency of the allele is \(1 \times 10^{-6}\).

4. **Interpretation of the Formula:**  
   The formula \(\frac{\mu}{s}\) assumes that the selection coefficient \(s\) represents the fitness cost of the homozygote. However, in reality, the selection coefficient \(s\) typically represents the relative fitness of the heterozygote compared to the homozygote. This discrepancy suggests that the formula may not be directly applicable, but it still provides a reasonable estimate of the equilibrium frequency.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Based on the given parameters and the formula, the equilibrium frequency of the allele is \(1 \times 10^{-6}\). This corresponds to **Option C**.

ANSWER: C
