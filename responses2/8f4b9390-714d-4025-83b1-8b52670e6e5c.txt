Okay, so I've got this psychology question here about the influence of the five early schools of thought on modern psychology. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out which option is correct from A to J.

First, I should probably recall what the early schools of thought are. I remember that there were figures like John Locke, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud. Each of them contributed to different areas of psychology.

The question is asking about their influence on modern psychology. So, I think each school of thought had a significant impact but also some critiques or were not entirely correct.

Looking at the options:

A: The early schools were only relevant to their cultural origins. I don't think that's true. Modern psychology has evolved beyond their times, so their influence is broader. So A might be incorrect.

B: Modern psychology recognizes early schools but doesn't credit them. Wait, I think early schools were acknowledged, but maybe it's not that they are not recognized. So B sounds wrong.

C: All early schools are obsolete. No, that doesn't make sense. They've had a lasting impact, though perhaps not in their entirety anymore. So C seems wrong.

D: Modern rejects their principles. That's not accurate. Modern psychology incorporates many aspects, so D is incorrect.

E: Each school influenced modern psychology. Hmm, I'm not sure. Some are more influential than others. For example, Jung's influence is big, but others like Freud and Hume are also important. So E might not be correct because it's not all the same.

F: Early schools didn't influence modern psychology. That's the opposite of E. So F is likely incorrect.

G: They're replaced by a unified theory. I think Jung's theory was the first unified approach, but others like Freud and Locke also had major contributions. So G might not be correct.

H: Three schools dominate, one is discredited. I remember that three did significantly influence, and the remaining two had issues. For example, Jung's theory is often considered authoritative, but there's also the idea of dualism and another school. So H might be correct if three are the main.

Wait, let me think again. The five early schools: Locke, Hume, Kant, Jung, and Freud. I think three had a big impact, and two were not. So H says three are dominant. So H is correct?

But wait, I'm not sure about exactly which ones. Let me think. Jung's theory of exploration and intake influenced a lot. Hume's skepticism about causality was important. Locke's ideas on human nature were foundational. So three (Jung, Hume, Locke) are major, and the other two (Kant, Freud) have their own issues. So H is correct.

Wait, but the options are between H and others. Let me check the other options.

Option E: Each school influenced modern psychology. Well, Jung's theory is the most influential, but there were other major schools too like Freud and Hume. So E is not correct because not all five (or just three) influenced as much as others.

So, looking back, H says three did, and another was discredited. Wait, I think only two were not. So the correct statement is H: Three of the early schools dominate modern psychology, the other two have been discredited. So the answer would be H.

Wait, let me think again on the options:

Looking at the options again: 

Option H: Three of the early schools of thought continue to dominate psychological research and practice, while the other two have been discredited. 

I believe that's correct. So H is the correct answer.

The correct answer is H: Three of the early schools of thought continue to dominate psychological research and practice, while the other two have been discredited.

**Answer: H**
