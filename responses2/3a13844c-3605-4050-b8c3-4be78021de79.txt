Question:

I don't understand why everyone thinks they belong in college. After all, everyone knows that when you are intelligent you'll succeed. But so many people that elect to attend college don't have even the most basic intelligence. How do they expect to get anywhere here?

Options:

A: Attacking the Person (ad hominem)
B: Straw Man
C: Denying the Antecedent
D: Begging the Question

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the user is confused about why people think they should go to college. The question mentioned that intelligence isn't a factor and that many people don't even have the basic intelligence to succeed. The options are ad hominem, straw man, denying the antecedent, and begging the question.

First, I need to understand each term. Ad hominem is when someone attacks the person's arguments instead of addressing their premises. So if someone claims intelligence is necessary, an ad hominem argument would be refuting that person's own claims, not necessarily their decision to go to college.

Straw man is when someone presents an argument that's an unfavorable version of the issue being discussed. For example, if someone argues that college is bad, they might instead present a positive argument about job skills or personal growth, making it seem like college is a bad idea.

Denying the antecedent is a logical fallacy where someone assumes that if a condition isn't met, the outcome isn't. So if someone says, "It's impossible to succeed without intelligence," and then says, "So not having intelligence will make you fail," they're denying the antecedent. But in this context, the user doesn't think intelligence is a factor.

Begging the question is when someone presents an argument that assumes the conclusion is already true, which isn't helpful because it doesn't solve the problem. So if the argument is about going to college, and someone assumes that college means you can't succeed, that's begging the question.

Looking back at the question, the user is questioning the assumption that intelligence is a factor in college. The possible answers don't all directly support why people go to college despite lacking basic skills. The main issue is the lack of evidence for intelligence as a prerequisite, which isn't a logical fallacy but rather a lack of support for the claim.

Wait, but the options are all logical fallacies. So perhaps they're asking which fallacy applies when someone presents a straw man. For example, someone might say that college is necessary because it's hard, and then present a positive argument. That's a straw man fallacy.

So the correct answer would be B: Straw Man, as it's an argument that misrepresents the issue, presenting a more favorable version of it.

The correct answer is **B: Straw Man**, as it involves presenting an unrepresentative or favorable argument to mislead the reader into accepting the original claim.
