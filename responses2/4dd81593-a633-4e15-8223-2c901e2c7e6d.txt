Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the calories needed to raise the temperature of water. Hmm, I remember from my science class that this involves specific heat capacity. Let me think... specific heat is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius. 

Wait, the formula is probably Q = m * c * ΔT, right? Where Q is the heat, m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature. I think the specific heat for water is about 1 calorie per gram per degree Celsius. So c is 1 cal/g°C.

The problem says 1,000 grams of water. So m is 1000 grams. The temperature goes from 10°C to 100°C, so the change is 90 degrees. Let me plug that into the formula.

Q = 1000 g * 1 cal/g°C * 90°C. Let me calculate that. 1000 * 90 is 90,000. So Q is 90,000 calories. Looking at the options, option H is 90,000 calories. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. Is the specific heat 1 calorie per gram per degree, or different? I think for water it's about 1, but maybe it's 1.04 or something. Oh wait, maybe I should double-check. Wait, no, I think in most basic problems, it's assumed to be 1 cal/g°C. So yeah, 90,000.

To calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of 1,000 grams of water from 10°C to 100°C, we use the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \). Here, \( m = 1000 \, \text{g} \), \( c = 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \), and \( \Delta T = 90°C \). Plugging in the values: \( Q = 1000 \cdot 1 \cdot 90 = 90,000 \, \text{calories} \). The correct answer is 90,000 calories, which corresponds to **option H**.

Answer: H
