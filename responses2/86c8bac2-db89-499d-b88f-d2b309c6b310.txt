Okay, so I've got this question about Gamma Co.'s financial metrics, and I'm a bit rusty on my finance, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question states: Gamma Co., a medical product manufacturer, had a 10% return on assets (ROA) and an asset turnover of 4:1. They're asking what Gamma's profit margin on sales was. The options are A through I, with some percentages and decimals.

Hmm, I remember that ROA is calculated as net income divided by total assets. The formula is ROA = (Net Income / Total Assets). And profit margin on sales is Net Income divided by Sales. Oh, and asset turnover is Sales divided by Total Assets, so it's like how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.

Wait, the formula for ROA can also be expressed in terms of profit margin and asset turnover. I think it's ROA = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover. Because ROA is Net Income / Assets, and Profit Margin is Net Income / Sales. Then, Asset Turnover is Sales / Assets. So if I rearrange those equations, maybe I can find the Profit Margin.

Let me write this out. ROA = (Net Income / Assets) and Profit Margin = (Net Income / Sales). So, substituting the Profit Margin into the ROA equation: ROA = (Profit Margin) * (Sales / Assets). But wait, because Profit Margin is (Net Income / Sales), and Assets = Sales / Asset Turnover. So substituting in, maybe it's better to rearrange.

Alternatively, since ROA = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover, then Profit Margin = ROA / Asset Turnover.

Oh, that makes sense. Because if ROA is 10%, and the asset turnover is 4, then Profit Margin would be 10% divided by 4, which is 2.5%. Wait, but looking at the options, 2.5% isn't an option. The options are A: 1.00%, B:4.00%, C:0.025, D:25.00%, E:10.00%, F:0.40%, G:0.10%, H:0.04%, I:40.00%. So 2.5% isn't there, but wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait another thought. Let me double-check. ROA is Net Income / Assets. Profit Margin is Net Income / Sales. Asset Turnover is Sales / Assets. So, to get ROA, it's (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) = (Net Income / Assets) = ROA. So, ROA = (Profit Margin) * (Asset Turnover). So, Profit Margin = ROA / Asset Turnover.

Plugging in the numbers: ROA is 10% (0.10), and Asset Turnover is 4. So 0.10 / 4 = 0.025, which is 2.5%. But the options don't have 0.025 as an option. Oh wait, option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%, but that's not an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are A: 1.00% (1%), B:4, C:0.025, D:25, E:10, F:0.40, G:0.10, H:0.04, I:40. So 2.5% is not an option. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula directly. Let's think about the relationships. The asset turnover is 4:1, which means that for every dollar of assets, the company generates $4 in sales. So, Sales = Assets * 4.

ROA is Net Income divided by Assets. So, Net Income = ROA * Assets = 10% * Assets. But I don't know the actual asset value.

Wait, but we can calculate Profit Margin on Sales. Profit Margin is Net Income divided by Sales. Let's say Net Income is 10% of Assets (since ROA is 10%). And Sales is 4 times Assets.

So, Profit Margin = (0.10 * Assets) / (4 * Assets) = 0.10 /4 = 0.025, which is 2.5%. But the options don't have this. Hmm, the options' C is 0.025, which is 2.5%, but no option exists for that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%, but in the options provided, it's given as 0.025. So maybe I made a mistake and the answer is 2.5%. But the options don't have such an option.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the formula. Let me try another approach. The formula for ROA is (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) = Net Income / Assets = ROA. So, ROA equals Profit Margin multiplied by Asset Turnover. So, Profit Margin = ROA / Asset Turnover.

ROA is 10%, and Asset Turnover is 4. So 10% /4 = 2.5%. So, 2.5% is 0.025 as a decimal. But in the options, option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%. So that's a possible answer. But the options don't have that. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Another approach: Let's assume that the company has $1000 in assets. Then, with an asset turnover of 4:1, Sales = 4 * $1000 = $4000.

ROA is 10%, so Net Income is 10% of $1000 = $100.

So, Profit Margin is Net Income / Sales = $100 / $4000 = 0.025, which is 2.5%. So, the profit margin on sales is 2.5%.

But looking at the options, option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%. Option D is 25%, which is 25%, not 2.5%. So, the correct answer would be 2.5%, but that's not an option. However, the option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%. So, if the correct choice is 2.5%, but it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement. Let me reread it.

The question says: Gamma had a 10% return on assets and an asset turnover of 4:1. What was the profit margin on sales.

So, the ROA is 10%, and Asset Turnover is 4. Then Profit Margin on Sales is ROA / Asset Turnover, which is 10% /4= 2.5%.

Looking at the options, the only option with 2.5% is option C, which is 0.025. But 0.025 is 2.5% as a decimal. So, perhaps the correct answer is C: 0.025.

Wait, but in the options, option C is 0.025, which is 2.5%. So the answer is C.

But wait, looking back, the initial calculation gives 2.5%, which is option C. But the options don't have 2.5%. Wait, the options are A:1.00%, B:4.00%, C:0.025, D:25.00%, E:10.00%, F:0.40%, G:0.10%, H:0.04%, I:40.00%.

So, 2.5% is not an option, but C is 0.025, which is 2.5%. So that's the correct answer if it's 2.5%.

The question asks for Gamma Co.'s profit margin on sales, given a 10% return on assets (ROA) and an asset turnover of 4:1. 

1. **Understanding the Formulas**:
   - ROA = Net Income / Assets
   - Profit Margin on Sales = Net Income / Sales
   - Asset Turnover = Sales / Assets

2. **Key Relationship**:
   - ROA = Profit Margin on Sales Ã— Asset Turnover

3. **Calculation**:
   - Profit Margin on Sales = ROA / Asset Turnover
   - Profit Margin on Sales = 10% / 4 = 2.5%

4. **Answer Options**:
   - Option C: 0.025 (which is 2.5%) matches the calculated profit margin.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: 0.025**.
