Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about a surface integral involving a vector field F over a sphere. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The vector field is given as F = k r^n \hat{r}, where r is the position vector, and n is some exponent. The surface S is a sphere of radius a centered at the origin. I need to compute two surface integrals: the flux integral (the dot product integral) and the curl integral (the cross product integral).

Wait, but wait. I remember that for closed surfaces, there are some theorems like Gauss's law or the divergence theorem that can help compute such integrals. So maybe I don't have to compute them directly by integrating over the surface; instead, I can use the divergence theorem for the flux integral.

Let me think about the flux integral first. The flux integral is ∫∫_S F · n̂ dS, which is the same as ∫∫_S F · dS. By the divergence theorem, this is equal to the triple integral of the divergence of F over the volume enclosed by S. So I'll compute the divergence of F and then integrate it over the sphere.

So F = k r^n \hat{r}. I need to find div F. Let me recall that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of F for a vector field in the form F = f(r) \hat{r} is (1/r^2) d/dr [r^2 f(r)]. Let me apply that formula here.

f(r) is k r^n. So r^2 f(r) is k r^{n + 2}. Then, taking the derivative with respect to r: d/dr [k r^{n+2}] = k (n+2) r^{n+1}.

Dividing by r^2 (from the divergence formula), the divergence becomes (k (n+2) r^{n+1}) / r^2 = k (n+2) r^{n-1}.

So div F = k (n+2) r^{n-1}.

Now, I need to integrate this over the volume of the sphere. The volume integral of r^{n-1} over a sphere of radius a is (volume) * [k (n+2)] * [average of r^{n-1}]. Wait, but the average of r^{n-1} over the sphere is zero unless n-1 is even, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in spherical coordinates, r is integrated from 0 to a, and the other variables integrate from 0 to 2π and 0 to π.

Wait, the volume integral is ∫ (from r=0 to a) ∫ (θ=0 to π) ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) r^{n-1} * r^2 sinθ dφ dθ dr.

Wait, because in spherical coordinates, the volume element is r² sinθ dφ dθ dr. So the integral becomes:

∫0^a r^{n-1} * r² dr * ∫0^π sinθ dθ * ∫0^{2π} dφ.

Simplifying the exponents: n-1 + 2 is n+1, so the integral over r is ∫0^a r^{n+1} dr.

The integral of r^{n+1} dr is (r^{n+2})/(n+2) evaluated from 0 to a, so it's a^{n+2}/(n+2).

The θ integral is ∫0^π sinθ dθ = 2.

φ integral is ∫0^{2π} dφ = 2π.

Putting it all together, the volume integral is (k (n+2)) * [a^{n+2}/(n+2)] * (2) * (2π) ) 

Simplify: the (n+2) in numerator and denominator cancels, so (k) * a^{n+2} * 2 * 2π.

So the flux integral is 4π k a^{n+2}.

Wait, but wait, hang on. That's the flux. So the first integral, the flux, is 4π k a^{n+2}.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option B has 4πk a^{n+2}, and option A has 2πk a^{n+3}, etc. So flux integral is 4πk a^{n+2}.

Wait, but wait, I should double-check my steps. Oh, wait, the divergence is k (n+2) r^{n-1}, right? So when I integrate this over the volume, the integral is k (n+2) ∫∫∫ r^{n-1} dV.

Which is k (n+2) ∫ r^{n-1} * (r² sinθ dφ dθ dr) → r^{n-1} * r² = r^{n+1}, so the integral becomes k (n+2) ∫0^a r^{n+1} dr * ∫0^π sinθ dθ * ∫0^{2π} dφ.

Compute each integral:

r integral: [r^{n+2}/(n+2)] from 0 to a → a^{n+2}/(n+2).

θ integral: 2.

φ integral: 2π.

Multiply all together: [a^{n+2}/(n+2)] * 2 * 2π = 4 π a^{n+2}/(n+2) * (n+2) ) → 4π a^{n+2}.

Wait, no, the (n+2) in the denominator and the (n+2) from the φ integral cancel each other. So the flux integral is 4π k a^{n+2}.

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 4πk a^{n+2} with the second part -1. Option A is 2πk a^{n+3} which doesn't match. So flux integral is 4πk a^{n+2}, which is option B.

Now, let's think about the second integral, the curl integral ∫∫_S F × n̂ dS.

Hmm, for the curl, maybe it's tricky. Wait, but perhaps there's a symmetry that can make this easier. F is k r^n \hat{r}, so its magnitude is kr^n, and direction is radial.

Wait, F is a radial vector field. The curl of a radial vector field depends on the field's dependence on position. Let me think about whether F is conservative or not. Because for a conservative vector field, the curl is zero. But F is radial, so it's not necessarily conservative, but in three dimensions, if F is radial, it might depend on the distance from the origin. 

Wait, for F = kr^n \hat{r}, the divergence we calculated earlier is the derivative of k r^n over some terms. But for the curl, let's think about spherical coordinates.

In spherical coordinates, the curl of a vector field F = F_r \hat{r} + F_θ \hat{θ} + F_φ \hat{φ} is:

(1/(r sinθ)) [∂(F_φ sinθ)/∂θ - ∂F_θ/∂φ] \hat{r} 
+ (1/r) [∂F_r/∂φ - ∂(r F_φ)/∂r] \hat{θ}
+ (1/(r sinθ)) [∂(r F_θ)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ] \hat{φ}

But in our case, F is only radial, so F_θ = F_φ = 0. So the curl becomes:

In the r component: (1/(sinθ)) [∂(0)/∂θ - ∂0/∂φ] → 0.

In the θ component: (1/r) [∂F_r/∂φ - ∂(r * 0)/∂r ] → 0.

In the φ component: (1/(r sinθ)) [∂(r * 0)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ ] → 0.

So curl F is zero. Wait, that's only if F has no angular dependence, which is true because F is purely radial. So the curl of F is zero.

Wait, but wait, I think that's correct. So the curl of F is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin. But since our surface S is a sphere of radius a, which doesn't include the origin as long as a is non-zero. So in this case, the curl is zero over the entire volume, so by Stokes' theorem, the surface integral of F·dS would be zero.

Wait, but wait. If F is radial, then the curl being zero implies that F is a conservative field, right? Because in simply connected regions (like the sphere minus the origin), a curl-free vector field is conservative. So, yeah, the curl is zero, so integrating F·dS over S would give zero.

So the second integral is zero.

So putting it together, the flux integral is 4π k a^{n+2}, and the curl integral is zero.

Looking at the options, option B is 4πk a^{n+2}, -1. Wait, the second part is '-1' in option B. Hmm, but wait, what about the second integral in the options?

Wait, no, the options give two integral results. For the flux, it's 4πk a^{n+2}, and for the curl, it's zero. So looking at the options, option B is 4πk a^{n+2} and the second part is -1. Option B isn't matching, because the curl is zero. Let me look again.

Oh wait, the choices are for each integral, right? So the flux is the first part, curl is the second. The options are pairs, like option B is flux 4πk a^{n+2} and curl -1. But wait, I just concluded that the curl is zero, so the second part is zero. So none of the options have the curl as zero. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 2π k a^{n+3}, -1 → flux is non-zero, curl is -1.

B:4πk a^{n+2}, 0 → flux is non-zero, curl is zero.

C:2πk a^{n+2},0 → same as B.

Wait, but I thought the curl was zero. So the correct answer would have the flux as 4πk a^{n+2} and curl zero. So looking at the options, which options have that? Option B and C have the flux as 4πk a^{n+2}, but only option B has curl zero. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but in the options, option B is 4πk a^{n+2}, -1... No, wait, I thought the curl was zero. Looking back, the options are:

Let me recheck.

Looking back, the options are:

A: 2πk a^n+3, -1

B:4πk a^n+2, 0

C:2πk a^n+2,0

D:6πk a^n+2, π

E:3πk a^n+1, π a^n

F:4πk a^n+3, 1

G:4πk a^n, 0

H:4πk a^n-1, 0

I:2πk a^n, 2π a^n

J:4πk a^n+1, 0

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about the curl.

Wait, wait, wait. Another approach: the curl of a radial vector field.

In spherical coordinates, F = kr^n \hat{r}.

The curl formula in spherical coordinates is:

curl F = (1/r sinθ)[ ∂(F_φ sinθ)/∂θ - ∂F_θ/∂φ ] \hat{r} 
    + (1/r)[ ∂F_r/∂φ - ∂(r F_φ)/∂r ] \hat{θ} 
    + (1/(r sinθ))[ ∂(r F_θ)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ ] \hat{φ}

But since F_θ= F_φ=0, because F is purely radial, let's substitute:

curl F = (1/r sinθ) [0 - 0] \hat{r} + (1/r)[ ∂(kr^n)/∂φ - ∂(r * 0)/∂r ] \hat{θ} + (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂0/∂r - ∂(kr^n)/∂θ ] \hat{φ}

So each component:

r component: 0.

θ component: (1/r) [ ∂(kr^n)/∂φ ] → since F doesn't depend on φ, this is zero. So θ component is zero.

φ component: (1/(r sinθ)) [ 0 - ∂(kr^n)/∂θ ] → which is (-k r^n) / (r sinθ) ) = (-k r^{n-1}) / sinθ.

But wait, in spherical coordinates, curl F is zero only if the vector field is conservative, but in this case, the φ component is non-zero.

Wait, but that can't be right, because I've derived that the curl has a non-zero φ component. So perhaps I made a mistake in the curl calculation.

Wait, another approach: for a radial vector field F = f(r) \hat{r}, the curl is zero only if f is a constant function. Because in three dimensions, if F is radial, then it's only conservative if F is constant, which is when f is a constant. Otherwise, the curl is non-zero.

Wait, but according to the spherical coordinate calculation, the curl is non-zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spherical calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate. The curl formula for F = F_r \hat{r} is:

curl F = (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(F_φ sinθ)/∂θ - ∂F_θ/∂φ \hat{r} 

+ (1/r) [ ∂(F_r)/∂φ - ∂(r F_φ)/∂r ] \hat{θ}

+ (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(r F_θ)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ ] \hat{φ}

But since F_θ = F_φ = 0,

curl F = (1/(r sinθ)) [0 - 0] \hat{r} + (1/r) [ ∂(0)/∂φ - ∂(r*0)/∂r ] \hat{θ} + (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(0)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ ] \hat{φ}

So,

= 0 * \hat{r} + 0 * \hat{θ} + [ (0 - ∂(kr^n)/∂θ )/(r sinθ) ] \hat{φ}.

So the φ component is [ -k n r^{n-1} ] / (r sinθ ) = -k n r^{n-2} / sinθ.

Wait, that's not zero unless n is zero. So for n not zero, the φ component is non-zero. So the curl is not zero.

But wait, I must have made a mistake because I thought F = kr^n \hat{r} would have zero curl. So what's going on here.

Wait, maybe I should compute the divergence and see if that makes sense. The divergence of F = (kr^n) \hat{r} is:

div F = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² (kr^n) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr (k r^{n+2}) ) = (1/r²)(k (n+2) r^{n+1} )) = k (n+2) r^{n-1}.

So the divergence is non-zero unless n = -2. So what about the curl? Because for a conservative vector field, the divergence is zero and the curl is zero. But F's divergence is non-zero, so it's not conservative.

Wait, but F is radial. So I thought in 3D, a radial vector field is conservative only if it's constant, i.e., if F = f(r) \hat{r} and f(r) is constant. Because otherwise, the field doesn't have a curl of zero.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the condition for the curl of a radial vector field. Let me recall that in three dimensions, the curl of F = f(r) \hat{r} is zero only if f(r) is a constant function. Because otherwise, as we've calculated, it would have a non-zero φ component.

Wait, but then the curl isn't zero, which would mean that the flux integral is non-zero, and the curl integral is non-zero as well.

Wait, but in that case, the options would have both flux and curl as non-zero.

Looking back, the options are:

Option B: 4πk a^{n+2}, 0.

Option C: 2πk a^{n+2}, 0.

Wait, so both flux and curl are zero. But according to our calculation, the curl is non-zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in the curl. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another approach.

Wait, let's think about the surface integral of F × n̂ dS. Since F is radial and n̂ is radial, their cross product is zero. So F × n̂ = 0. So the surface integral is zero. So the second part should be zero.

Wait, but earlier, we thought that the curl of F (for F being radial) is non-zero. So the second integral is zero, which matches option B and C.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the flux is 4πk a^{n+2}. So the flux integral is 4πk a^{n+2}, and the curl integral is zero. So the correct answer would have the flux as 4πk a^{n+2}, and the curl as zero. Looking at the options, that's option B:4πk a^{n+2}, 0.

But wait, the options are:

A:2πk a^n+3, -1

B:4πk a^{n+2}, 0

C:2πk a^{n+2},0

D:6πk a^{n+2}, etc.

So option B says the flux is 4πk a^{n+2}, and the curl is zero.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the curl might be zero, but that's not correct. Because F is radial, and the curl is non-zero except when F is constant. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation. So perhaps the curl is non-zero, but in that case, the second integral would not be zero. So I must be wrong.

Wait, let me try another approach. For a vector field F = f(r) \hat{r}, the curl is given by:

curl F = ( (1/r²) ∂(r² f(r)) ) / r² sinθ dθ )

Wait, perhaps I should compute the curl in spherical coordinates correctly.

The curl formula in spherical coordinates is:

curl F = (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(F_φ sinθ)/∂θ - ∂F_φ/∂φ ] \hat{r}

+ (1/r) [ ∂F_r/∂φ - ∂(r F_φ)/∂r ] \hat{θ}

+ (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(r F_θ)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ ] \hat{φ}

But since F_φ = F_θ = 0,

curl F = 0 \hat{r} + 0 \hat{θ} + [ (1/(r sinθ)) ∂0/∂r - (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_r/∂θ ] \hat{φ}

Hmm, that's [ 0 - (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(kr^n)/∂θ ] \hat{φ}.

But ∂(kr^n)/∂θ = 0, since kr^n is independent of θ. So overall, the φ component is zero.

Wait, that can't be right, because earlier calculation showed a non-zero φ component. So I'm definitely confused.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the curl in cylindrical coordinates, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the curl of a radial vector field. Let me think about some references.

Wait, another approach: The curl of F is zero only if F is a conservative vector field. For F = kr^n \hat{r}, F is conservative only if F is a constant vector. So if kr^n is a constant, then F is conservative. So if F is conservative, then the curl is zero. So let's see when F is conservative.

F = kr^n \hat{r}

If F is conservative, then F must be the gradient of some scalar potential. But in three dimensions, if F is the gradient of a scalar, then F must satisfy ∇×F=0. But F is a radial vector, so ∇×F=0 only if F is a constant vector.

So F is conservative only if F is constant, which happens when kr^n is a constant. So kr^n = C, so r = (C/k)^{1/n}. That would be a sphere of radius a, where a = (C/k)^{1/n}.

So if a is a constant, then F is conservative, so curl F is zero.

So in our problem, the sphere is a sphere of radius a, so if a is a constant, then F is conservative. Therefore, the curl integral would be zero.

But in our problem, the sphere is a sphere of radius a, so a is a constant, so F is conservative, and so curl F is zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the curl of F is non-zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps in spherical coordinates, F is radial, so the curl is zero because F is a gradient of a scalar function. No, wait, F is a vector, not a scalar.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the curl in spherical coordinates correctly. Let me re-express the curl formula for F = f(r) \hat{r}.

In spherical coordinates, the curl is:

curl F = ( (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(f(r) sinθ) / ∂θ - 0 ) / r sinθ \hat{r}

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me refer to a standard curl formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the Maxwell's equations approach. Wait, no, Maxwell's equations are in terms of E and B fields, not F.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for curl in spherical coordinates, I found a source that says:

curl F = (1/(r^2 sinθ)) [ ∂(F_φ sinθ)/∂θ - ∂F_φ/∂φ ] \hat{r}
+ (1/(r)) [ ∂F_r/∂φ - ∂(r F_φ)/∂r ] \hat{θ}
+ (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(r F_θ)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ ] \hat{φ}

But since F_φ = F_θ = 0,

curl F = 0 \hat{r} + 0 \hat{θ} + (1/(r sinθ)) [ 0 - ∂(kr^n)/∂θ ] \hat{φ}.

So the φ component is ( - ∂(kr^n)/∂θ ) / (r sinθ ).

But since F_φ = 0, the term is zero. So the φ component is zero.

Wait, but that can't be correct because earlier calculation of the φ component gave non-zero.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the φ component. The curl formula in spherical coordinates is:

curl F = (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(F_φ sinθ)/∂θ - ∂F_φ/∂φ ] \hat{r}
+ (1/r) [ ∂F_r/∂φ - ∂(r F_φ)/∂r ] \hat{θ}
+ (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(r F_θ)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ ] \hat{φ}

Since F_φ = F_θ = 0,

curl F = 0 \hat{r} + 0 \hat{θ} + (1/(r sinθ)) [ 0 - ∂(kr^n)/∂r ] * r sinθ.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting the calculations wrong.

Wait, if F_φ = 0, then the first two terms are zero. The third term is (1/(r sinθ)) [ ∂(r F_θ)/∂r - ∂F_r/∂θ ].

But F_θ = 0, so ∂(r F_θ)/∂r = 0. The other term is ∂F_r/∂θ. So the third term is (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂F_r/∂θ.

So the φ component is (1/(r sinθ)) * ∂(kr^n)/∂θ.

But since F_φ = 0, this term is zero.

Wait, but that's not correct, because earlier calculation of the φ component gave a non-zero result.

Ah, wait, I think I made a mistake in the way I substituted F into the curl formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, curl F has three components, each computed using the respective partial derivatives.

Wait, another approach: the curl of F = f(r) \hat{r} is given by:

curl F = (1/r²) ∂(r² f(r)) / ∂r \hat{r} - (1/r²) ∂(r² f(r) ∂θ/∂θ) ) \hat{θ} + ... no, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in Cartesian coordinates. Let me consider F = (kr^n, 0, 0), since it's a radial vector in the x-direction.

In Cartesian coordinates, F = (kr^n, 0, 0).

The curl in Cartesian coordinates is:

curl F = ( ∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z, ∂F_x/∂z - ∂F_z/∂x, ∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y )

Since F_z = 0, F_y = 0, F_x = kr^n.

So,

curl F_x = ∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z = 0 - 0 = 0.

curl F_y = ∂F_x/∂z - ∂F_z/∂x = 0 - 0 = 0.

curl F_z = ∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y = 0 - 0 = 0.

So the curl is zero in Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, but that's a contradiction with our earlier calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spherical coordinate approach.

Wait, but according to the Cartesian approach, the curl is zero, which implies that the flux integral is zero, and the curl integral is zero. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, but wait, according to the Cartesian calculation, the curl is zero. So the second integral of the problem is zero.

But earlier, when I thought F was radial, I thought the curl might be non-zero, but in reality, according to the Cartesian approach, it's zero.

So, in the problem statement, the second integral is zero, but in the options, none of the options have both flux and curl as zero. Wait, the options are:

Option B: 4πk a^{n+2}, 0 → flux is non-zero, curl is zero.

Option C: 2πk a^{n+2},0 → same as B.

So, if the correct answer is that the flux is 4πk a^{n+2}, and the curl is zero, then the correct option is B.

But according to the calculation, curl is zero. So the correct answer is B.

But wait, in the problem statement, the options are:

A: 2πk a^n+3, -1

B:4πk a^n+2, 0

C:2πk a^n+2,0

D:6πk a^n+2, π

E:3πk a^n+1, π a^n

F:4πk a^n+3, 1

G:4πk a^n, 0

H:4πk a^n-1, 0

I:2πk a^n, 2π a^n

J:4πk a^n+1, 0

So, the correct answer is B.

Wait, but why does the curl integral being zero make sense? Because according to the Cartesian approach, the curl is zero, so the surface integral of F × n̂ dS is zero, so the second integral is zero.

But earlier, when I thought F is radial, I thought the curl might be non-zero, but that can't be because of the Cartesian approach. So the correct answer must be that the flux is 4πk a^{n+2}, and the curl is zero. So option B is correct.
</think>

The problem involves evaluating two surface integrals over a sphere of radius \( a \). The vector field is given as \( \mathbf{F} = kr^n \hat{\mathbf{r}} \), where \( k \) and \( n \) are constants. The integrals are:

1. \( \int_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}} \, dS \) (Flux integral)
2. \( \int_S \mathbf{F} \times \hat{\mathbf{r}} \, dS \) (Curl integral)

### Analysis

#### 1. Flux Integral

The flux integral is given by:

\[
\Phi = \int_S \mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}} \, dS
\]

Since \( \mathbf{F} = kr^n \hat{\mathbf{r}} \), the dot product simplifies to:

\[
\mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}} = kr^n
\]

The flux integral becomes:

\[
\Phi = \int_S kr^n \, dS
\]

The surface area element \( dS \) on a sphere of radius \( a \) is \( a^2 \). Substituting:

\[
\Phi = k \int_S r^n \, dS = k \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} a^{n+2} \sin\theta \, d\theta d\phi
\]

The integral over the sphere simplifies to:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^{\pi} \sin\theta d\theta = 4\pi
\]

Thus:

\[
\Phi = 4\pi k a^{n+2}
\]

#### 2. Curl Integral

The curl of \( \mathbf{F} \) is given by:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{F}
\]

For \( \mathbf{F} = kr^n \hat{\mathbf{r}} \), the curl is zero because \( \mathbf{F} \) is a conservative vector field. To confirm, we can compute the curl in Cartesian coordinates. Let \( \mathbf{F} = (kr^n, 0, 0) \). The curl components are:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right)
\]

Substituting \( F_x = kr^n \), \( F_y = 0 \), \( F_z = 0 \):

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = (0, 0, 0)
\]

Thus, the curl integral is zero.

### Final Answer

The flux integral is \( 4\pi k a^{n+2} \), and the curl integral is zero. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**ANSWER: B**
