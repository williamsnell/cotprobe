Okay, so I've got this problem here about Pauline Key's earnings. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand everything correctly.

So, the question is about calculating Pauline's gross earnings for the week. She earns $3.50 per hour. The pay structure is a bit specific: she gets time and a half for any hours worked over 40, and double the regular rate for Sunday. Last week, she worked 48 regular hours and 4 and a half hours on Sunday. 

Let me break this down. First, I need to calculate her earnings from the regular hours. She worked 48 hours, but wait, regular hours are up to 40. So, the first 40 hours are regular pay, and the extra 8 hours are time and a half.

Regular pay rate is $3.50 per hour. For the first 40 hours, she gets $3.50. Then, the 8 hours over 40 are at 1.5 times that rate.

Let me compute the regular pay: 40 hours * $3.50 = $140. Then, the overtime (time and a half) is 8 hours * $3.50 * 1.5. Let me calculate that: 8 * 3.50 is 28. Multiply by 1.5 gives 42. So, overtime is $42.

So, regular pay is $140, overtime is $42. That's $182 so far.

Next, the Sunday part. She worked 4.5 hours on Sunday. The problem says she gets double the regular rate for Sunday. Her regular rate is $3.50, so double that is 7.00 per hour.

So, 4.5 hours * 7.00 = let's see... 4 * 7 is 28, and 0.5 *7 is 3.5. So total is 31.50.

Adding that to the previous total: 182 + 31.5 = 213.5.

Wait, let me check the options. The options are A: 199.75, B:220.75, C:176, D:182.50, E:235, F:213.50, G:244.50, H:229, I:207.25, J:195.

So F is 213.50, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, regular hours are 48? Wait, no, she worked 48 regular hours. But wait, regular hours are up to 40. So, 40 at regular, and 8 at overtime. So, 40 *3.5=140, 8*3.5*1.5=42, totaling 182.

Sunday: 4.5 hours at double the regular. Double is 7. So 4.5 *7=31.5. 182+31.5=213.50. That's option F.

So the answer should be F: 213.50.

The correct calculation involves breaking down the hours into regular, overtime, and Sunday hours, then applying the respective pay rates. For regular hours (40 hours), she earns $3.50 per hour, and for the remaining 8 hours, she gets time and a half. On Sunday, she works 4.5 hours at double the regular rate. Adding these together gives her total gross earnings of $213.50.

Answer: F: $213.50
