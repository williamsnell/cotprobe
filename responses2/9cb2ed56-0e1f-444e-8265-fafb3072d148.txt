Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of nuclear reactions. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question says: If two protons and two neutrons are removed from the nucleus of neon-20, which element remains? The options are A to J, various elements and isotopes. 

Hmm, I remember that in a nucleus, protons are part of the nucleus along with neutrons. The number of protons determines the element, right? Like, if a nucleus has 6 protons, it's carbon, and so on. So the key here is to find out how the number of protons changes when we remove protons and neutrons.

Neon-20 has a certain number of protons and neutrons. Neon is element 10, so its atomic number is 10. So neon-20 has 10 protons and 10 neutrons because the mass number (which is 20) is the sum of protons and neutrons. So the formula for the number of neutrons would be neutrons = mass number - protons. So 20 -10=10 neutrons. 

The problem says two protons and two neutrons are removed. So the new number of protons would be 10 (original) minus 2, which is 8. And the number of neutrons would be 10 minus 2, which is 8 as well. Wait, wait. But wait a second, because when you remove protons and neutrons, the resulting nucleus would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons. 

What element has an atomic number of 8? Let me think. The first few elements: Hydrogen (1), Helium (2), Lithium (3), Beryllium (4), Boron (5), Carbon (6), Nitrogen (7), Oxygen (8). Oh, so element 8 is oxygen. So the resulting nucleus would be an oxygen isotope. 

What's the mass number? It's the sum of protons and neutrons. So 8 protons and 8 neutrons would give a mass number of 16. So the element would be oxygen-16. Looking at the options, option C is Magnesium-16, which is incorrect because magnesium has 12 protons. Option B is Neon-16, which would have 10 protons. Option F is Magnesium-22, which would be 12, but we have 8. Option G is Oxygen-20... Wait, no, because our mass number is 16, not 20. So the correct one is Oxygen-16. Wait, but wait, the options list some as Magnesium and Oxygen.

Wait, the options: Let me check again. The options are:

A: Magnesium-18
B: Neon-16
C: Magnesium-16
D: Oxygen-22
E: Neon-18
F: Magnesium-22
G: Oxygen-20
H: Magnesium-20
I: Oxygen-16
J: Oxygen-18

So, the correct element is oxygen (8), and the isotope would have 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so the mass number is 16. So the isotope is oxygen-16. Looking at the options, that's 'G' and 'I'. Wait, 'I' is Oxygen-16. So the correct answer should be I: Oxygen-16. But wait, hold on.

Wait, no. Wait a minute. Neutron count goes from 10 to 8, so mass number is 8 +8=16. So the new nucleus is 16. So the element is oxygen (8), and the isotope is 16, so Oxygen-16. So option I is Oxygen-16. Hmm, but the current options list 'G' as Oxygen-20. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me double-check. Neon-20 has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. If two protons and two neutrons are removed, the new number of protons is 10-2=8, and neutrons are 10-2=8. So the mass number is 8+8=16. So the isotope is Oxygen-16. So the correct option is I: Oxygen-16. But wait, looking back at the options, option I is Oxygen-16. So the correct answer should be I.

But wait, another thought: sometimes I get confused between mass number and atomic number. Oh, right, atomic number is the number of protons, which determines the element. So yeah, the element is oxygen, and the mass number is 16. So the correct option is I: Oxygen-16.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: Mg-18

B: Ne-16

C: Mg-16

D: O-22

E: Ne-18

F: Mg-22

G: O-20

H: Mg-20

I: O-16

J: O-18

So the correct one is I.

To determine which element remains after removing two protons and two neutrons from neon-20, we start by analyzing the initial composition of neon-20. Neon has an atomic number of 10, meaning it has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. The mass number of 20 confirms this, as \( \text{protons} + \text{neutrons} = 10 + 10 = 20 \).

When two protons and two neutrons are removed, the new number of protons becomes \( 10 - 2 = 8 \), and the new number of neutrons becomes \( 10 - 2 = 8 \). The mass number of the resulting nucleus is the sum of the new protons and neutrons: \( 8 + 8 = 16 \). 

The element corresponding to an atomic number of 8 is oxygen (O). Therefore, the resulting nucleus is oxygen-16. 

Now, examining the options:
- **A: Magnesium-18** — Incorrect, as magnesium has 12 protons.
- **B: Neon-16** — Incorrect, as neon has 10 protons.
- **C: Magnesium-16** — Incorrect, as magnesium has 12 protons.
- **D: Oxygen-22** — Incorrect, as oxygen has 8 protons.
- **E: Neon-18** — Incorrect, as neon has 10 protons.
- **F: Magnesium-22** — Incorrect, as magnesium has 12 protons.
- **G: Oxygen-20** — Incorrect, as the mass number is 16, not 20.
- **H: Magnesium-20** — Incorrect, as magnesium has 12 protons.
- **I: Oxygen-16** — Correct, as oxygen has 8 protons and the mass number is 16.
- **J: Oxygen-18** — Incorrect, as oxygen has 8 protons.

Thus, the correct answer is **I: Oxygen-16**.
