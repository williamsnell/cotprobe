Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the reaction between magnesium metal and chromium nitrate. Hmm, I remember that when metals react with solutions of other substances, they typically undergo oxidation and the solution undergoes reduction. 

So, magnesium is a metal, and chromium nitrate is the solution. Magnesium is a group 2 metal, so it's more reactive than group 1. In general, metals in group 2 (like Mg) will oxidize to Mg²+ ions in solution. 

Chromium is in group 3, which is a bit trickier. Wait, but when chromium is in solution, like in nitrate, it will probably reduce. The nitrate ions are the oxidizing agents here. So in the reaction, magnesium will lose electrons (oxidation), and the nitrate will gain them (reduction).

The reaction equation should show the transfer of electrons. Let's think about the half-reactions.

Mg metal will lose electrons: Mg → Mg²+ + 2e⁻. 

Chromium in nitrate would gain electrons. The nitrate is the oxidizing agent, so it'll be reduced. Let's write the reduction half-reaction. 

Cr³+ + 3e⁻ → Cr(s). Oh wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, chromium in nitrate is Cr³+. So in the reduction half-reaction, it's going to Cr metal, which is Cr⁰. So the reduction would involve Cr³+ gaining electrons.

So, the reduction half-reaction is:
Cr³+ + 3e⁻ → Cr(s)

But wait, the nitrate as a whole is in solution. So the nitrate comes from Cr³+ in solution. So the nitrate ions (Cr(NO3)3) would contribute the Cr³+.

Let me write the overall reaction.

First, the oxidation: Mg → Mg²+ + 2e⁻.

The reduction: Cr³+ + 3e⁻ → Cr(s).

To balance electrons, I need to find a common multiple. So, for each Mg, 2 electrons are lost. Each Cr³+ gains 3 electrons. So, multiply the Mg reaction by 3 and the Cr reaction by 2.

Mg → Mg²+ + 2e⁻ (multiplied by 3: 3Mg → 3Mg²+ +6e⁻)
Cr³+ + 3e⁻ → Cr (multiplied by 2: 2Cr³+ +6e⁻ → 2Cr)

Now, add them together:

3Mg + 2Cr³+ → 3Mg²+ + 2Cr.

Wait, that's the overall reaction. So let me write this as a net ionic equation.

The reactants are Mg(s) and Cr³+ (from Cr(NO3)3). The products are Mg²+ and Cr(s). 

Now, the nitrate ions (NO3⁻) are spectators, right? So they don't appear in the net ionic equation.

So the net ionic equation would be:

3Mg(s) + 2Cr³+ → 3Mg²+ + 2Cr(s)

Looking at the options:

Option I: 2Mg(s) + 2Cr(NO3)3(aq) → 2Mg²+ + 2Cr(s) + 2NO3⁻(aq).

Wait, that's 2Mg and 2Cr(NO3)3. Let's see what that equation represents.

If I break down option I, the Mg is being oxidized, and Cr³+ is being reduced. But the nitrate is present as ions. In the net ionic equation, the nitrate should not be part of the equation. So option I includes nitrate, which is not part of the net ionic equation. So option I is incorrect.

Option E: 3Mg(s) + 2Cr³+ → 3Mg²+ + 2Cr(s). That's exactly what I wrote. So option E is the correct net ionic equation.

Wait, let me check the other options. 

Option G: Mg(s) + Cr³+ → Mg²+ + Cr(s) + 3NO3⁻. That's incorrect because the nitrate is a spectator ion, it's not present in the net ionic equation.

Option A: 4Mg(s) + 3Cr(NO3)3 → 4Mg²+ +3Cr +3NO3⁻. That's wrong because the nitrate is not on the product side. Also, the metal product is Cr, which is not a metal in a pure form; reduction of Cr³+ gives Cr(s), so the product should be Cr metal. So option A is wrong.

Option B: 3Mg + 2Cr³+ →3 Mg²+ + 2Cr + NO3⁻. Incorrect because nitrate is a spectator, and the nitrate should not be on the product side.

Option C: 2Mg(s) + Cr³+ → 2Mg²+ + Cr(s). That's missing the coefficient for nitrate. Wait, no, because nitrate is in solution, but in the net ionic equation, it's included as spectator ions.

Wait, no. The correct equation is 3 Mg(s) + 2 Cr³+ → 3 Mg²+ + 2 Cr(s) + 3 NO3⁻? No, because in the net ionic equation, the nitrate is not present. So the correct net ionic equation is without the nitrate.

Looking again, option I is correct, because it's 3Mg and 2 Cr³+ → 3 Mg²+ + 2 Cr. So the nitrate is not part of the equation.

Other options:

Option H: Mg(s) + Cr³+ → Mg²+ + Cr(s). That's the same as option G, but without the nitrate. So if the question includes nitrate, but the reaction doesn't involve nitrate, then option H is incorrect.

So the correct net ionic equation is option I.

To determine the correct net ionic equation for the reaction between magnesium metal and chromium (III) nitrate, we analyze the reaction as follows:

1. **Oxidation and Reduction Half-Reactions**:  
   - Magnesium metal (Mg) is oxidized to magnesium ions (Mg²⁺):  
     \[ \text{Mg(s)} \rightarrow \text{Mg²⁺(aq)} + 2e⁻ \]
   - Chromium (III) ions (Cr³⁺) are reduced to elemental chromium (Cr):  
     \[ \text{Cr³⁺(aq)} + 3e⁻ \rightarrow \text{Cr(s)} \]

2. **Balancing Electrons**:  
   - To balance the electrons, we multiply the oxidation half-reaction by 3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2:  
     \[ 3\text{Mg(s)} \rightarrow 3\text{Mg²⁺(aq)} + 6e⁻ \]  
     \[ 2\text{Cr³⁺(aq)} + 6e⁻ \rightarrow 2\text{Cr(s)} \]

3. **Combining the Half-Reactions**:  
   - Adding the two half-reactions cancels out the electrons:  
     \[ 3\text{Mg(s)} + 2\text{Cr³⁺(aq)} \rightarrow 3\text{Mg²⁺(aq)} + 2\text{Cr(s)} \]

4. **Spectator Ions**:  
   - The nitrate ions (NO₃⁻) in chromium (III) nitrate (Cr(NO₃)₃) are spectator ions and do not appear in the net ionic equation.

5. **Analyzing the Options**:  
   - **Option I**: \( 3\text{Mg(s)} + 2\text{Cr³⁺(aq)} \rightarrow 3\text{Mg²⁺(aq)} + 2\text{Cr(s)} \)  
     This matches the derived net ionic equation and is correct.  
   - **Other Options**:  
     - Options A, B, D, E, F, G, and H either include incorrect stoichiometry, omit the nitrate ions, or do not represent the reaction accurately.

Thus, the correct net ionic equation is **Option I**.
