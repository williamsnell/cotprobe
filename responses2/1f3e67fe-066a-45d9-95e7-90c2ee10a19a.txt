Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the remainder when 3^47 is divided by 23 using Fermat's Little Theorem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Fermat's theorem, but I remember it's related to primes and exponents. Let me think.

Fermat's Little Theorem says that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a that's not divisible by p, a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. So in this case, p is 23, which is a prime. And a is 3, which isn't divisible by 23. So according to the theorem, 3^(22) ≡ 1 mod 23. That's useful.

Now, I need to compute 3^47 mod 23. Let me see. Since 3^22 is 1 mod 23, I can express 47 as a multiple of 22 plus some remainder. Let's calculate 47 divided by 22. 22 * 2 = 44, which leaves a remainder of 3. So 47 = 22*2 + 3. So 3^47 = (3^22)^2 * 3^3.

But since 3^22 ≡ 1 mod 23, this simplifies to (1)^2 * 3^3 mod 23. So 3^47 ≡ 3^3 mod 23. 3^3 is 27. Now, 27 divided by 23 is 1 with a remainder of 4. So 27 mod 23 is 4. Therefore, the remainder should be 4.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.

The remainder when 3^47 is divided by 23 is calculated using Fermat's Little Theorem. Since 3 and 23 are coprime, 3^22 ≡ 1 mod 23. Expressing 47 as 22*2 + 3, we find 3^47 ≡ (3^22)^2 * 3^3 ≡ 1^2 * 27 ≡ 27 mod 23. 27 mod 23 is 4. Thus, the answer is **D: 4**.
