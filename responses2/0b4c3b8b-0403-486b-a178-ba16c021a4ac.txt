Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric flux through a Gaussian cube. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says there's a particle with a charge of 1.8 microCoulombs at the center of a Gaussian cube. The edge of the cube is 55 cm. I need to find the net electric flux through the surface.

Wait, wait, what's a Gaussian surface again? Oh right, it's a closed surface where the net electric flux through it is equal to the charge enclosed divided by epsilon naught. Oh yeah, Gauss's Law. That's the key here.

So Gauss's Law formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀. Right, where Φ is the electric flux, Q is the enclosed charge, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity constant.

Wait, but wait a second. The cube is a Gaussian surface, so it's closed. The charge is at the center, so the entire charge is enclosed within the cube. So Φ should just be Q divided by ε₀.

Now, the charge given is 1.8 microC. Micro is 1e-6, so that's 1.8e-6 Coulombs.

What's ε₀? Oh right, it's approximately 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²). So I'll plug those numbers in.

Let me calculate Φ. Φ equals 1.8e-6 C divided by 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²). Let's compute that.

Calculating 1.8e-6 / 8.85e-12. Let me see, 1.8 / 8.85 is about 0.20385. Then, 1e-6 / 1e-12 is 1e6. So 0.20385 * 1e6 is 203850, which is approximately 2.0385e5 N·m²/C.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.0e5, which is about 2.0 times 1e5. So that's the closest.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh wait, is the charge enclosed? Yes, the problem says the particle is at the center, so the entire charge is enclosed. So yes, the flux is Q/ε₀.

So the correct answer would be option J, 2.0e5 N·m²/C.

To determine the net electric flux through the surface of the Gaussian cube, we use Gauss's Law, which states:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
\]

Here:
- \( Q_{\text{enc}} \) is the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface, which is \( 1.8 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \) or \( 1.8 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \).
- \( \varepsilon_0 \), the vacuum permittivity, is approximately \( 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m^2)} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Phi = \frac{1.8 \times 10^{-6}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12}}
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
\Phi \approx 203850 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C} \approx 2.0 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C}
\]

Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is option J: \( 2.0 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C} \).
