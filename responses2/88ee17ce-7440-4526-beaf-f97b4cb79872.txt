Options:

A: 6000 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
B: 3600 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
C: 14400 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
D: 10800 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
E: 4500 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
F:  7200 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
G: 9000 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
H: 3000 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
I: 1800 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$
J: 21600 $\mathrm{ft-lb}$

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a gorilla climbing a tree. The question is asking for the work done, and I need to find the correct option from A to J. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that work is calculated using the formula: Work equals force multiplied by distance. So, W = F * d. Right, that's the basic formula. 

Now, the problem gives me the gorilla's weight as 360 pounds. Wait, weight is a force, right? So in this case, the force (F) would actually be the gorilla's weight, which is 360 lb. 

Next, the height climbed is 20 feet. But wait, the units here are a bit tricky. The weight is in pounds, which is a unit of force, and the height is in feet. So the distance (d) is 20 feet. 

So plugging these into the formula: Work = 360 lb * 20 ft. Let me do the math. 360 times 20 is 7200. So the work done should be 7200 foot-pounds.

Looking at the options, option F is 7200 ft-lb. So that must be the answer. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Oh, right, the time taken is 5 seconds. Wait, but time isn't part of the formula hereâ€”it's about the force and distance. The time is probably just extra information, maybe to trick the test-taker. Because in real physics, for work, we don't need time, unless it's about power (which is work over time), but the question specifically asks for work, so time isn't needed. 

So yeah, the answer is F, 7200 ft-lb.

The work done by the gorilla is calculated using the formula \( W = F \times d \), where \( F \) is the force (360 lb) and \( d \) is the distance (20 ft). 

Calculations:
\( W = 360 \, \text{lb} \times 20 \, \text{ft} = 7200 \, \text{ft-lb} \).

Answer: F (7200 ft-lb).

Answer: F
