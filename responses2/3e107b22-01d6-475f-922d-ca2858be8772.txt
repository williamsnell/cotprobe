Okay, so I've got this question about ionizing helium, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see. The question says that the energy required to remove both electrons from a helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV. I need to find the energy needed to remove just one electron, right?

Wait, I remember that ionization usually refers to removing an electron from an atom. So for helium, which has two electrons, the first ionization would remove one electron, then the second would remove another. But the question here is about the total energy required to remove both electrons. Oh wait no, wait. The question says the energy to remove both is 79.0 eV. So that's the sum of the first and second ionization energies, I think.

So if I denote the first ionization energy as I1 and the second as I2, then I1 + I2 = 79.0 eV.

But wait, I'm pretty sure that the second ionization energy is higher than the first. Because the second electron is in a lower energy level (since it's removed from a He atom that's already lost one electron, so He+ is He with one electron removed, so the next electron is in the 2p orbital, which is lower in energy than the 2s. So when you remove the second electron, the energy required is higher than I1.

So the question is asking for I1, the energy to remove one electron.

Hmm, I think I need to look up the standard ionization energies for helium. Wait, I remember that the ionization energy for the second electron of He is about 12.3 eV. Let me think why.

Wait, the ground state for He is He^2+ with electrons in 2s^2. When you remove the first electron, it goes to 2s with energy, and the second goes to 2p. But for ionization, the energy required is the energy difference between the bound state and the free electron.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the ionization potential for He. The ionization potential is the energy required to remove the first electron. For helium, the first ionization potential is around 12.3 eV. Wait, but wait, waitâ€”no. Wait, no, when you remove the first electron from He, you have to go from He atom (n=2) to He+ (n=1). That requires 12.3 eV. But when you remove both electrons, you have to remove the first (12.3 eV) and then the second, which is higher. So the second might be around 12.3 plus the energy for the 2p.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The first ionization energy (IE1) is the energy needed to remove the first electron from He. The second ionization energy (IE2) is the energy needed to remove the second electron from He+.

The total energy for removing both would be IE1 + IE2. So the question says that's 79.0 eV. So IE1 + IE2 = 79.

But I know that I1 is the first ionization energy, which is about 12.3 eV. But wait, wait. Wait, no. No, wait, wait. I might be mixing up the numbers.

Wait, let's clarify. I think the correct values are:

IE1 (removing first electron) is approximately 12.3 eV, and IE2 is approximately 12.3 eV plus some more because the second electron comes from a higher energy state.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first ionization energy of He is about 12.3 eV. The second ionization energy (IE2) is about 12.3 eV plus the energy needed to remove an electron from He+ (which is He with one electron removed, so He+ is He atom's 2s and 2p electrons removed, leaving He+ which is He with a single electron in the 2s orbital? Or is it He+ with electrons in 2p? Wait, no, He has two electrons. When He loses one, it's He^+ which has one electron. The electron would be in the 2s orbital. Then, when you remove the second electron, it's in the 2p orbital, which is higher in energy.

Wait, so the energy required to remove the first electron (IE1) is 12.3 eV. The energy required to remove the second electron (IE2) is IE1 plus the energy needed to remove the 2p electron from He+.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the total energy is the sum of IE1 and IE2. So IE1 + IE2 = 79 eV.

Let me look up the standard values. Wait, I think the second ionization energy for He is about 7.44 eV. Wait, no, that's not right. Because He has two electrons. I'm getting myself mixed up.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For He, the first ionization energy is approximately 12.3 eV. The second ionization energy is about 7.44 eV. But wait, that can't be right because if you remove the first electron, you're left with He+ (which has 2s electron), and then removing the second would require more energy. Oh wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, let me think of He as He^2+. The first ionization would be to He^+, which is He with one electron removed. The energy for this would be IE1 = 12.3 eV. Then the second ionization would be removing another electron from He^+ (which is He with one electron in 2s). So the energy for that is IE2 = 12.3 (IE1) plus the energy required to remove the 2p electron. Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I'm not remembering the exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the second ionization energy for He is about 7.44 eV. So IE1 + IE2 = 12.3 +7.44=19.74 eV, which is way less than 79. So that can't be it.

Wait, so perhaps I'm miscalculating. Maybe the way the problem is structured, the total energy for removing both electrons is the sum of the first and second ionization energies.

So 79.0 eV is IE1 + IE2. If I know that IE1 is 12.3 eV, then IE2 would be 79.0 -12.3 =66.7 eV. That would be a high value, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but another approach: the ionization energy for He is about 12.3 eV for the first electron. The second would be the energy required to remove the second electron, which is from He^+ (He with one electron removed). The energy required would be the energy difference between the 2p orbital and the 2s orbital in He^+.

Wait, in He^+, the electron is in the 2s orbital, which has a lower energy than the 2p. So when you remove another electron from He^+, it goes into the 2p, which is higher. So the energy required would be the energy difference between 2p and 2s. The energy difference for that transition is approximately 12.3 eV. Wait, but wait, that would make IE2=12.3 eV, which would make the total IE1 + IE2 = 24.6 eV, but the question says the sum is 79.0 eV. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the electrons. Maybe He^+ (He with one electron) has electrons in the 2p orbital. So when you remove an electron, it goes to 2p, which is higher in energy than 2s.

So the energy required to remove the second electron (IE2) would be the energy difference between 2p and 2s in He^+.

What's that value? I think the energy for this is around 7.44 eV. So IE1 is 12.3, IE2 is 7.44. So the total would be 19.74 eV, which is too small. But the question says the total is 79.0 eV.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I'm considering the wrong ionization energies.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the first ionization energy with the second. Let me look up the standard ionization energies.

Wait, I think the first ionization energy of He is about 12.3 eV. The second is about 12.3 eV, but wait, no. No, wait, wait. Another source I recall says that the second ionization energy of He is 7.44 eV. Then, the total would be 12.3 +7.44=19.74 eV. But the question says the sum is 79.0 eV, which is way bigger.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct state. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ionization energy for the second electron is higher because it's being removed from a He+ ion. So if the first ionization energy is 12.3 eV, the second is 12.3 + IE2 (the energy required to remove the 2p electron).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Let's think again.

Wait, the energy required to remove the first electron from He is 12.3 eV. That's the first ionization energy.

When you remove the second electron from He^+, which has an electron in the 2p orbital, the energy required to remove that is the energy difference between the 2p and 2s orbitals. I think the energy difference is approximately 7.44 eV.

So the total ionization energy for He would be 12.3 +7.44=19.74 eV. But according to the question, the sum is 79.0 eV. So that's off by a factor of about 4. So that can't be it.

Ah, so perhaps the question is not talking about ionization from the ground state but ionizing to a different state. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the energy required to ionize He but to ionize He+.

Wait, wait, the question says, "How much energy is required to ionize helium (i.e., to remove one electron)?"

So He has two electrons. I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy to remove both electrons, which is 79 eV. So the energy for the first ionization is I1, and the second is I2, and I1+I2 =79.

If I1 is the first ionization energy, which is 12.3 eV, then I2 would be 79-12.3=66.7 eV. But when I look up the second ionization energy, I think it's around 7.44 eV for He, but that would make the total 12.3 +7.44=19.74 eV, which isn't 79.

So perhaps, I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps this is not about ionization from the ground state but ionization to another state. Or perhaps the question is about the energy required to ionize He to He+.

Wait, another thought: maybe the total energy to ionize He (to He+) is 79.0 eV. So the ionization energy would be 79.0 eV. But that would mean that one electron is removed, not two. So the question is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says, "the energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV." So it's the sum of removing both.

So if I1 + I2 =79, and I1 is 12.3, then I2=66.7. But that doesn't match any of the given options, which are around 12.3, 60, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the first ionization wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think the first ionization energy is about 12.3 eV. But maybe I'm confusing the first ionization with the second.

Wait, another approach: the ionization potential for the second electron is 7.44 eV. So, IE1 is 12.3 eV, IE2 is 7.44 eV. So the sum is 19.74 eV, which is about 20 eV. But the question says that the sum is 79 eV. So that's not matching.

So perhaps the question is not considering the second ionization energy of He, but something else. Or perhaps the question is referring to the ionization potential of He+.

Wait, the ionization potential for He+ (which is He with one electron removed) would be around 12.3 eV, because He+ is He with one electron, so the energy required to remove the second electron from He+ is higher. Wait, but that's just the first ionization of He+.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options given.

The options are A to J, and the correct one is E:24.6 eV.

Wait, 24.6 eV is about half of 49.2 eV (which is 2*12.3), so that could be the first ionization energy.

Wait, but I thought the first ionization energy was about 12.3 eV. So why is option E 24.6?

Wait, another perspective: Perhaps the question is considering the energy to remove one electron from He, but not both. So, for He, the first ionization energy is 12.3 eV, which is option B. But the question is about removing both, so the first ionization energy is 12.3 eV, but the total is 79 eV.

So the correct answer for the question would be 12.3 eV. But wait, the question is asking for the energy to remove one electron, which is the first ionization energy.

Wait, but the question says the energy to remove both electrons is 79. So if I1 is 12.3, then I2 is 66.7. But 66.7 is not in the options except for D:60.8 eV. Hmm, that doesnâ€™t fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the ionization of He to He^2+ (which is He with two electrons removed), but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that He has a higher energy ionization because of the way the electrons are arranged. Wait, no, that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the ionization energies of different elements. Let me think: for Helium, the first ionization energy is about 12.3 eV. The second is about 7.44 eV. So the sum is 19.74 eV. But the question says the sum is 79.0 eV. That's way higher, so perhaps the question is wrong or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm considering the ionization of He to He+ (so one electron removed) rather than He to He^2+. Because I'm getting confused about the states.

Wait, the question says "the energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV." So the problem is about removing both electrons from He in the ground state, which is He with two electrons.

So the energy for that is IE1 (12.3) + IE2 (7.44) = 19.74 eV. But the question states that the sum is 79. So that's not matching. So why is the sum 79 eV?

Ah, waitâ€”maybe I'm missing the fact that the first ionization energy includes the energy to remove the first electron, and the second ionization energy includes the energy to remove the second electron from the He+ ion. So perhaps the sum is 12.3 + (IE2 of He+) which is 7.44 eV. But then 19.74 eV, which is way below 79. So that can't be.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the question is not about the energy to remove one electron, but about the energy required to ionize He to He+ (removing one electron). So the energy would be 12.3 eV, which is option B. But the question says it's about removing both electrons, so that's not the case.

Wait, but the options include 24.6 eV. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps the first ionization energy is 24.6 eV. If that's the case, then perhaps the question is wrong, but I can't assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the energy required for removing one electron. The first ionization energy is 12.3 eV. So the answer would be option B. But the question says the sum is 79 eV. So that's confusing because the sum is way bigger than 12.3 plus 12.3.

Wait, another thoughtâ€”could the question be referring to the ionization energy for He+ (removing the second electron)? Because if you remove the second electron from He+, the energy required is 7.44 eV. But that would be the ionization energy for He+ to He^2+, which is the second ionization energy of He.

Wait, no, that's not correct because He is He with two electrons, and He+ has one. So the second electron is in He+.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to look for the correct standard values.

Wait, I think the correct first ionization energy is approximately 12.3 eV. The second is about 12.3 eV as well. Wait, that can't be right. Because the second would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up He with and without electrons. No, I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the first ionization energy is 12.3 eV, and the total for two electrons is 79 eV, so the second must be 66.7 eV. But that's not any of the options, except for option D:60.8 eV. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick and the answer is 12.3 eV, which is option B. But the question is about the energy required to remove both electrons, which would be 12.3 + something =79.

But that something doesn't match any of the options except perhaps 66.7.

Wait, none of the options match that, except option D:60.8 eV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ionization of the He atom to He+ (removing one electron), which would have an energy of 12.3 eV. But the question says to remove both.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 18.3 eV

B) 24.6 eV

C) 37.9 eV

D) 60.8 eV

E) 24.6 eV

Wait, option A is 18.3 eV, which is 12.3 * 1.5. That doesn't seem relevant.

Option B is 24.6 eV. That's about 12.3 * 2.

Wait, perhaps the sum of the first and second ionization energies is 79.0 eV. So let's think: 12.3 + (IE2) =79, so IE2=66.7 eV. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the energy required to remove both electrons, but the ionization energy of the He atom (removing one electron) is 12.3 eV. But the question is about removing two, which would be 79 eV.

Wait, the question says, "The energy required to remove both electrons from the He atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV. How much energy is required to remove one electron from the helium atom?"

No, that's wrong. If the energy required to remove both is 79, then the energy for one must be less than 79. But the options are 12.3, 24.6, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the standard ionization energies for He. The first is 12.3 eV, the second is 12.3 eV. So the sum is 24.6 eV. But the question states that the sum is 79 eV, which is way more.

Wait, but if the question is incorrect, perhaps the correct answer is 24.6 eV (option E), but that would be the sum of the first two ionization energies for He, which is 12.3 +12.3=24.6 eV.

But the question says that the energy required to remove both is 79.0 eV, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question intends to say that the energy required to remove one electron is 12.3 eV, but the sum is 24.6 eV. So why is the sum given as 79?

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is 12.3 eV, which is option B, because that's the first ionization energy.

Wait, but the question is about the energy required to remove one electron, not two. So the correct answer should be 12.3 eV.

Looking at the options, option B is 24.6 eV. That can't be right because that's double the first ionization energy.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the correct process again.

The energy required to remove the first electron from He is 12.3 eV. The energy required to remove the second electron from He+ (which has one electron in 2p) is 7.44 eV. So the total energy for removing both is 12.3 +7.44=19.74 eV. But the question states that the sum is 79.0 eV.

So that's not matching. So perhaps the question is considering the ionization of He to He+ and then to He^2+.

Wait, but that would be a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy required to remove one electron, but the sum includes the energy for the second electron.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's not about the energy required to remove both electrons, but about the energy required to remove one electron from He in its ground state.

So, the ground state of He is a He atom with two electrons. So the first ionization energy would be to remove one electron, which is 12.3 eV. The second would be to remove another, which is 12.3 eV (if the ionization energy is the same for both) or higher.

Wait, but the second ionization energy of He is about 12.3 eV. So the sum of the two would be 24.6 eV, which is option E.

But the question states that the sum is 79.0 eV, which would be way too big.

So perhaps the question is incorrectly phrased, or perhaps I'm missing the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ionization energy of He to one electron.

So, the ionization energy for He to lose one electron is 12.3 eV. The ionization energy for He+ (losing another electron) is 12.3 eV. So the total ionization energy for losing two electrons would be 12.3 +12.3 =24.6 eV.

But the question states that this sum is 79.0 eV, which doesn't fit.

So perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. But based on the options given, the correct answer would be the first ionization energy, which is 12.3 eV, option B.

Wait, but the question is about the energy required to remove one electron, so the answer is 12.3 eV.

But the options have option B as 24.6 eV, which is the sum of two first ionization energies. So perhaps that's the correct answer if the question intended to ask about the sum.

Wait, the question says: "How much energy is required to ionize helium (i.e., to remove one electron)?"

So, the correct answer is 12.3 eV, which is option B.

But the options also include 24.6 eV, which is the sum of the first two ionization energies. So perhaps the question is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct and the answer is 24.6 eV.

Because the energy required to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV. Wait, if that's the case, then the energy to remove one electron would be 79.0 minus the energy for the second.

But that doesn't make sense because removing the first would leave the second to be removed, so the energies would be cumulative.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. Let me think again.

The energy required to remove both electrons is 79 eV. So the energy for the first electron is I1, and the energy for the second is I2, so I1 + I2 =79.

If I1 is the first ionization energy (12.3 eV), then I2 would be 79 -12.3=66.7 eV.

But none of the options match that.

But the options include 24.6 eV. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the first ionization energy, but about the ionization potential for He+.

Because He+ requires 12.3 eV to become He^2+.

Wait, but that would be the same as the first ionization energy.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is option B:12.3 eV, because that's the first ionization energy, and the question is about removing one electron. But the problem states that the sum of both is 79 eV, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is correct, and the answer is 79 eV. But that's not an option. So the correct answer is 12.3 eV, which is option B.

Wait, but the question is about removing one electron, so the answer is 12.3 eV.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I'll have to make my best guess.

The options are:

A) 18.3 eV

B) 24.6 eV

C) 37.9 eV

D) 60.8 eV

E) 24.6 eV

Wait, option E is the same as B, which is 24.6 eV.

So perhaps the question is incorrect, and it's about the sum, but the options have 24.6 twice.

But the correct approach would be to think that the first ionization energy is 12.3 eV, so the correct answer is option B.

But the question says, "the energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV." So perhaps the sum of the first and second ionization energies is 79 eV. So, first ionization is 12.3, second is 66.7, which would make the sum 79. But the second ionization energy is about 7.44 eV, not 66.7.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the ionization potential with another concept. I'm not making progress, so I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is 12.3 eV, which is option B.
</think>

The energy required to remove one electron from a helium atom in its ground state is the first ionization energy, which is approximately **12.3 eV**. The question states that the energy required to remove both electrons is **79.0 eV**, but this value does not align with the standard ionization energies for helium. The first ionization energy for helium is **12.3 eV**, and the second ionization energy is much smaller, around **7.44 eV**. The total energy for removing both electrons would be **19.74 eV**, not **79.0 eV**. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is **12.3 eV**, which corresponds to option **B**.

ANSWER: B
