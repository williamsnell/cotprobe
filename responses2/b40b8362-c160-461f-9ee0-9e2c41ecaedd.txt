Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spaceships approaching Earth with equal speeds but in opposite directions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through.

So the problem says that two spaceships approach Earth, each with the same speed as measured by someone on Earth. But from their respective frames of reference, one is moving and the other is stationary. Wait, no, actually, each spaceship is moving at the same speed as each other. Oh wait, no, the question says each has the same speed as the other? Or wait, the problem says each spaceship approaches Earth at the same speed as the Earth-based observer measures. So from Earth, each is moving at speed v. But each is in their own frame moving at speed v relative to Earth, and the other is moving at speed v in the opposite direction.

Wait, wait, so from Earth, each spaceship is moving at speed v. So in the Earth's frame, each spaceship is moving at the same speed, and opposite directions. So from the perspective of someone on one spaceship, the other is moving towards Earth at speed v, but their own meterstick is measured differently.

Ah, right, length contraction comes into play here. Length contraction is a relativistic effect where an object moving at a high speed appears to be shorter in the direction of motion from our perspective. So in the Earth's frame, each spaceship's meterstick is moving at speed v, so its length is contracted. But wait, no, the problem says that a meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm by the occupant of the other spaceship. So in the other spaceship's frame, the meterstick is at rest, so it's not contracted. Wait, no. Let's clarify.

Let me think again. Suppose in Earth's frame, both spaceships are moving at speed v. Each has a meterstick. So in Earth's frame, each is moving at speed v, so the meterstick is moving at v. So from Earth's perspective, the length of the meterstick would be L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (1 meter). So the contracted length is 1 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) meters.

But wait, the problem states that the occupant on the other spaceship measures 60 cm. So in the other spaceship's frame, the meterstick is at rest. So the length in the other spaceship's frame would be L' = L0 (since it's not moving in that frame). So the length of the meterstick is 1 meter in the Earth's frame, but each other ship's meterstick is 60 cm in their frame. So for the other spaceship, the meterstick is at rest, so the length doesn't contract. So from the other spaceship's perspective, the meterstick is 1 m, but from Earth's perspective, the meterstick is length-contracted.

Wait, but the problem says the occupant of the other spaceship measures the meterstick to be 60 cm. So perhaps I got that backwards. Let me rephrase.

Let me denote:

In Earth's frame (S frame), the two spaceships are moving at speed v. Each has a meterstick, which in Earth's frame is length L0, which is 1 m. Since the spaceship is moving, the meterstick appears contracted. So its length as measured by someone on the spaceship is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But the problem states that the occupant of the other spaceship measures the meterstick as 60 cm. So the other spaceship's frame (S' frame) sees the meterstick as 60 cm. So in S', the meterstick is at rest, so its length is 1 m. But in S, it's moving, so according to S, the length is 1 m * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 0.6 m. So 1 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 0.6 → sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 0.6 → 1 - v²/c² = 0.36 → v²/c² = 0.64 → v/c = sqrt(0.64) → v/c is 0.8. So v = 0.8 c.

Wait, but wait, maybe I got the frames mixed up. Let me think again: when you're in the Earth's frame, the meterstick is moving, so its length is shorter. So from Earth's perspective, the meterstick is 0.6 meters. From the other ship's perspective, the meterstick is 1 meter. So the problem says that the other ship's observer measures the meterstick as 60 cm, which is correct because in their frame, it's at rest.

So in Earth's frame, the meterstick is 1m, but due to length contraction, it's 0.6 m. So if the other ship's observer measures 0.6 m, then 0.6 m = 1m * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → sqrt(1 - v²/c^2) = 0.6 → 1 - v²/c² = 0.36 → v^2/c^2=0.64 → v= 0.8 c. So the speed is 0.8c.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.8c. So the correct answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity, particularly length contraction. In the Earth's frame (S frame), each spaceship is moving at speed \( v \) relative to Earth. The proper length of the meterstick in Earth's frame is \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \). Due to length contraction, the length of the meterstick as measured in the spaceship's frame is \( L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \).

The problem states that the occupant of the other spaceship measures the meterstick to be \( 60 \, \text{cm} \) (or \( 0.6 \, \text{m} \)) in their frame. In the other spaceship's frame (S' frame), the meterstick is at rest, so its length is the proper length, \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \). Therefore, in Earth's frame, the length of the meterstick is \( L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} \). Substituting the given values:

\[
0.6 = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
0.36 = 1 - v^2/c^2
\]

Rearranging:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v/c = \sqrt{0.64} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the speed of each spaceship is \( v = 0.8c \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is:
