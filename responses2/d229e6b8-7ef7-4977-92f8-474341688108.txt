Question:

In very basic terms describe the structure of a retroviral virion.

Options:

A: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding protein capsid, and an inner lipid bilayer envelope.
B: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer protein bilayer envelope.
C: The virion is composed solely of an RNA genome.
D: The virion is composed of the RNA genome and an outer carbohydrate bilayer envelope, without a capsid.
E: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding protein capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.
F: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.
G: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding lipid bilayer capsid, and an outer carbohydrate envelope.
H: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an inner protein bilayer envelope.
I: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding lipid bilayer capsid, and an inner protein envelope.
J: The virion is composed of a protein genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.

Okay, so I've got this question about retroviruses and their structure. I remember that retroviruses are a type of bacteriophage, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think this through.

The question asks what the structure of a retroviral virion looks like in very basic terms. The options are A through J, each describing different components. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Retroviruses, like the HIV, have a genome. I think their genome is RNA because they don't use DNA, which is common in many viruses. So their genome would be an RNA genome. That probably rules out options that say DNA genome. Looking at the options, options B, D, E, G, H, I, J all mention the RNA genome. So, the correct answer must be one of these.

Next, I need to think about the capsid and the envelope. I remember that the capsid is a protein part that protects the genome. So in most viruses, the capsid is a protein, like in mammalian viruses. For retroviruses, I think the capsid is a lipid, not a protein. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Or maybe I'm mixing up different types. Let me think again.

Wait, I think in retroviruses, the capsid is a lipid bilayer. Because in some other viruses, like HIV, the capsid is a protein. So HIV has a protein (capsid) around the DNA. But retroviruses, like HIV, I think have a lipid capsid. So the outer layer is a lipid bilayer, not a protein.

Then, what about the inner part? The inner of the virion is the genome, and the outer is the capsid. So the structure should be a protein capsid, an RNA genome, and an inner bilayer. Looking at the options, option E says: RNA genome, surrounding protein cap, outer lipid bilayer. That seems right.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option A: DNA genome, protein capsid, lipid. So no, because the genome is RNA.

Option B: RNA genome, carbohydrate capsid, outer protein. No, the outer is protein, not something else.

Option C: RNA genome and outer protein. But no capsid.

Option D: RNA genome, outer carbohydrate. No, outer is protein.

Option E: RNA genome, protein cap, outer lipid. That seems correct.

Wait another thing: for some viruses, like HCoin (which is a type of retrovirus), the capsid is a lipid. So, in option E, the outer is a lipid. That matches.

So the correct structure would be RNA genome, a protein capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer. So the answer should be option E.

The correct structure of a retroviral virion is composed of an RNA genome, a protein capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope. 

- **Option A** is incorrect because it describes a DNA genome.  
- **Option B** is incorrect because it describes a carbohydrate capsid.  
- **Option C** is incorrect because it lacks a protein capsid.  
- **Option D** is incorrect because it describes a carbohydrate outer envelope.  
- **Option E** correctly identifies the RNA genome, protein capsid, and lipid bilayer envelope.  
- **Option F** is incorrect because it describes a DNA genome.  
- **Option G** is incorrect because it describes a lipid capsid instead of a protein.  
- **Option H** is incorrect because it describes a protein capsid instead of a lipid.  
- **Option I** is incorrect because it describes a protein capsid instead of a lipid.  
- **Option J** is incorrect because it describes a protein genome.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option E**.
