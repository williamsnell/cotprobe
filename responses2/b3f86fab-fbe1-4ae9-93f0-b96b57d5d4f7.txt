Okay, so I've got this problem here about a tank shaped like a triangular prism. The question is asking how much water it would contain when full. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the triangular base has an area of 116 square feet. And the tank is 30 feet tall. I remember that a triangular prism has two triangular bases connected by three rectangular sides. So the volume of such a tank would be the area of the triangular base multiplied by the height (or length) of the prism.

Wait, so the formula for the volume of a prism is the area of the base times the height. Here, the base is a triangle with an area of 116, and the height of the prism (which is the same as the length of the prism) is 30 feet. So I need to multiply 116 by 30 to get the volume.

Let me do the math: 116 multiplied by 30. 100 times 30 is 3000, and 16 times 30 is 480. Adding those together gives 3480 cubic feet. So the volume is 3480 ft続.

Looking at the options, option F is 3480 ft続, which matches my calculation. So that's the right answer.

The volume of a triangular prism is calculated by multiplying the area of the triangular base by the length (height) of the prism. Given the base area is 116 sq ft and the height is 30 ft, the volume is:

116 * 30 = 3480 ft続.

**Answer: F: 3480 ft続**
