Okay, so I have this problem here: "How many positive integers are factors of 120 and also factors of 40?" And I have to choose from options A to J. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the question is about finding the common factors of 120 and 40. Oh right, that's the intersection of the factors of both numbers. So, the common factors would be the factors that are present in both 120 and 40. Alternatively, I remember that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers can help find the number of common factors.

Let me break this down. First, perhaps I should find the prime factors of both 120 and 40. That way, I can determine their greatest common divisor and then find how many factors that has.

Starting with 120. Let me do prime factorization. I know that 120 divided by 2 is 60, then 30, then 15. So, 2^3. Then 15 is 3*5. So, 120 = 2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1.

Now for 40: 40 divided by 2 is 20, divided by 2 again is 10, and again is 5. So that's 2^3. And then 5^1. So, 40 = 2^3 * 5^1.

Wait, but 40 doesn't have 3 as a factor, does it? Because 40 is 2^3 *5, so 3 is only in 120.

So the GCF would be the product of the lowest powers of the common primes. The primes in both are 2 and 5. For 2, the minimum exponent is 3, and for 5, it's 1. So GCF = 2^3 * 5^1 = 8 *5 =40.

Wait, so the GCF of 120 and 40 is 40. That means that all factors of 40 are also factors of 120? Hmm, let me think. Because if the GCF is 40, then any factor of 40 will divide 40, which divides 120, so yes, those factors would be common to both 120 and 40.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The GCF is 40, so how many factors does 40 have? Let me calculate that. 40's prime factors are 2^3 *5^1, so the number of factors is (3+1)*(1+1) = 4*2=8. So, 40 has 8 factors.

Wait, so does that mean the number of common factors is 8? Let me double-check. So the factors of 40 are 1,2,4,5,8,10,20,40. Are all of these factors of 120?

Let me check each one:

1: yes, 120/1=120, so yes.

2: 120/2=60, yes.

4: 120/4=30, yes.

5: 120/5=24, yes.

8: 120/8=15, yes.

10: 120/10=12, yes.

20: 120/20=6, yes.

40: 120/40=3, yes.

So all 8 of them are indeed factors of 120. So the answer should be 8, which is option H.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, I could also find the number of common factors by calculating the number of factors of the GCF. Since GCF is 40, which has 8 factors, the number of common factors is 8.

So the correct answer is 8, which is option H.
</think>

The number of positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40 is equal to the number of factors of their greatest common factor (GCF). 

The GCF of 120 and 40 is 40, which has 8 factors. Therefore, there are 8 positive integers that are common factors of both 120 and 40.

Answer: H: 8
