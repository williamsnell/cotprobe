Okay, so I've got this probability question here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is asking: What's the probability of getting a 5 on each of two successive rolls of a balanced die?

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with probability, I need to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.

A balanced die has six faces, right? So each roll has 6 possible outcomes. If we're rolling the die twice, I think the total number of possible outcomes is 6 multiplied by 6. Let me calculate that: 6 * 6 is 36. So there are 36 possible outcomes when rolling the die twice.

Now, the favorable outcome here is getting a 5 on each roll. So for the first roll, the chance is 1 out of 6 because there's only one 5. And the same goes for the second roll. So the probability for each individual roll is 1/6. Since the rolls are independent events, I can multiply the probabilities of each event happening.

That would be (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. So the probability of getting a 5 on both rolls is 1/36.

Looking at the options provided, option E is 1/36. So that must be the correct answer.

The probability of rolling a 5 on a balanced die is 1/6 for each roll. Since the rolls are independent, the combined probability is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.

Answer: **E: 1 / 36**
