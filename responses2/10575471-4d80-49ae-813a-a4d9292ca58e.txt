Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. 

The question is about using Chebyshev's inequality to find an upper bound for P(|X - 33| ≥ 14). X is a random variable with a mean of 33 and a variance of 16. The options are labeled A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember Chebyshev's inequality. It's a way to estimate probabilities without knowing the distribution of the variable, right? The formula, if I recall correctly, is that for any random variable X with finite mean μ and variance σ², the probability that X deviates from the mean by at least k standard deviations is at most 1/k².

So the formula is P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². That makes sense.

In this problem, the mean μ is 33, and the variance σ² is 16. So σ is sqrt(16), which is 4. The question asks for the probability that |X - 33| is at least 14. Let me see, 14 is the value we're looking at.

Wait, so |X - 33| is the deviation from the mean. We can write this as |X - μ| ≥ 14. Let's find out what k is in terms of the standard deviation. The standard deviation σ is 4, so 14 is 14/4 = 3.5 times the standard deviation. So k would be 3.5.

Plugging into Chebyshev's formula: P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/(k²). So k is 3.5. So k squared is (3.5)^2 = 12.25. So the probability is ≤ 1 / 12.25. Let me calculate that.

1 divided by 12.25 is approximately 0.083333... So, about 0.083. Looking at the options, option A is 0.082, which is close. But wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely.

Alternatively, maybe I can express 3.5 as a fraction. 3.5 is 7/2. So k² is (7/2)^2 = 49/4. So 1/(49/4) is 4/49. Let me compute 4 divided by 49. 49 goes into 4 zero, then 49 into 40 is 0.8, with 40-49*0.8=40-39.2=0.8. So 0.081632653... which is approximately 0.0816, so 0.0816 is about 0.082 when rounded to three decimal places. So that would match option A: 0.082.

Wait, but another thing: Chebyshev's inequality gives an upper bound that's always valid, but it's the tightest bound possible. So in this case, the calculation gives 4/49, which is approximately 0.0816, so the upper bound is at most 0.0816, but none of the options exactly match this. Wait, looking again at the options: A is 0.082, which is very close. Are there any other approaches?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me double-check. The problem states that |X - 33| ≥14. Since σ is 4, 14 is 14/4 = 3.5 standard deviations away. So k is 3.5. So that part is correct.

So 1/(3.5)^2 is 1/12.25. Let me compute that. 12.25 goes into 1 how many times? Well, 12.25 * 0.08 = 0.98. 0.08 * 12.25 = 0.98. So 0.08 is 0.98. But 12.25 * 0.083 is 1. So 1/12.25 is approximately 0.083333.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.082, which is just a little less than 0.0833. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but wait, let me check if I made any miscalculations.

Wait, another thought: Is the question asking for the probability that |X - 33| is ≥14, which is the same as the probability that X is at least 14 away from 33. So, with Chebyshev, that's exactly what the formula gives us. So, 4/49 is approximately 0.0816, which is 0.0816, so approximately 0.082.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.082. So that should be the answer. However, I should check if I made any miscalculations in the formula.

Wait, another angle: Could I have confused the variance with the standard deviation? Oh wait, no, the variance is 16, so σ is 4. So 14 = 3.5 * σ, so k is 3.5. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used Chebyshev's inequality in a different way. Wait, Chebyshev's inequality says P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². So if |X - μ| is 14, which is 3.5σ, then k=3.5, so 1/(3.5)^2= 4/49≈0.0816.

So that's correct. So the answer would be approximately 0.0816, which is 0.082 when rounded to three decimal places. So the closest option is A: 0.082.

Wait, another thought: Should I consider that Chebyshev's inequality provides an upper bound and the actual probability may be lower? But since the problem is asking for an upper bound, option A is the correct choice. So I should choose option A.

To solve the problem using Chebyshev's inequality, we start by noting that the mean (μ) is 33 and the variance (σ²) is 16, so the standard deviation (σ) is 4. We need to find an upper bound for P(|X - 33| ≥ 14). 

Chebyshev's inequality states that for any random variable X with mean μ and variance σ², the probability that X deviates from the mean by at least k standard deviations is at most 1/k². Here, |X - 33| ≥ 14 corresponds to k = 14/4 = 3.5. 

Applying the formula:
P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k² = 1/(3.5)² = 1/12.25 ≈ 0.0816.

The closest option to this value is 0.082 (option A).
