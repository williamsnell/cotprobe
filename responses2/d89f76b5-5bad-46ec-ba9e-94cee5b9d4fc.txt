Question:

This question refers to the following information.
At a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: "Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?" After that events moved quickly. We … discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.… At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.
—Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about Jane Addams's passage and which political goal the perspective supports. I remember that Jane Addams was an important figure in American history, especially during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She was a founding member of the NAACP, which was a strong political group advocating for labor rights and women's rights.

Looking at the passage, it describes a meeting at Hull House during a strike in a shoe factory. The key point mentioned is that the strikers who were most afraid were the ones who paid the board and were afraid of being out of step. Jane Addams points out that these women were the first to come down, so they were naturally the ones who were the easiest toimidate. They suggested forming a boarding club. 

The passage also mentions that the club was formed, they managed the club themselves, and by the end of the third year, they took over all six apartments in the original building. The settlement paid the first month's rent but took over the rest. I think this relates to the social class structure in the early 20th century, where the wealthy could afford to maintain a boarding club, while the working class couldn't. So, this shows a system where the wealthy could afford to support a social club, potentially leading to inequality and possibly the creation of a new social class.

Jane Addams's perspective here would support the idea that the wealthy could afford to form a club, which could lead to a situation where the lower social class couldn't afford to do the same, but in the passage, it's mentioned that the women (who paid the board) were the first to capitulate. This implies that the wealthy could afford to form a club, but the lower class couldn't, leading to a situation where the social class dynamics changed. 

Looking at the options, the relevant political goals would be those related to social class structures. The question asks which political goal is most supported by the passage. 

Option D: Women's suffrage. Well, the passage doesn't directly talk about women voting, but it does touch on the idea of a board (or club) that women formed. It's possible that it's a precursor to women's suffrage, but I'm not sure. 

Option A: Greater rights for unions. The passage doesn't mention unions at all, so I don't think that's the case here.

Option B: Increasing minimum wage. Not directly supported.

Option C: Mandatory health insurance. Unrelated to the passage.

Option D: Women's suffrage. The passage doesn't state that women gained rights, but it does suggest that the board was formed by those who paid the board, implying a shift towards women controlling the board. However, the passage doesn't mention women voting or becoming suffrages. It's more about the structure of the club and the social class.

Option E: Equal pay for equal work. The passage doesn't discuss pay equality.

Option F: Weakening political machines. The passage might show that the wealthy could afford to form a club, which could lead to a system where the wealthy had more influence, potentially weakening political machines. But I'm not certain if that's the direct point.

Wait, the passage says that the club was formed, and the wealthy could afford it. That might imply that the social class system was being challenged, leading to a situation where the wealthy could form a club, possibly leading to a situation where lower classes couldn't afford to do the same, which might indicate that the wealthy had more influence and possibly the political machines were weakening. So, weakening political machines (Option F) could be a political goal supported by the passage.

Alternatively, is there a connection to women's suffrage? The passage mentions that the board was formed by those who paid the board, which could imply that women's roles were taken over, but it's possible that this is more about the structure of the club rather than women's rights.

Another angle: the passage describes the club as being formed by members who were already in a position of influence (the ones who paid the board), so perhaps it's a precursor to women taking over leadership roles. But that's more about the structure of the club than a political goal.

So between F and D. The question is about political goals. The passage talks about the structure of the club, which could lead to the weakening of political machines because the wealthy could afford to afford the club. Or perhaps it reflects a shift towards a more equal society, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A to J. Looking back at the options, option D is women's suffrage. The passage doesn't mention women voting, but it does talk about the board being formed by those who paid the board. However, in the context of the passage, perhaps the point is more that the wealthy had more influence, leading to a weakening of political machines. So, weakening political machines (Option F) is the political goal supported here.

Alternatively, perhaps the passage is more about the shift in the structure of the club, but the question is about the political goal. 

Another thought: The passage mentions that the club was formed and that the wealthy could afford it, which might support the idea that the wealthy had more influence, possibly leading to political machines weakening. So, the political goal is weakening political machines.

So, looking at the options, the answer would be F: Weakening political machines.
