Okay, so I've got this question here about overhead distribution based on floor space. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

First, the question says that the overhead is distributed based on floor space. Department A is occupied with 8,100 square feet out of a total of 121,500 square feet used by Harrison Manufacturing.

The total overhead for the month is $97,500. I need to find out what portion of that overhead goes to Department A.

Hmm, so I think I need to calculate the percentage of the total floor space that Department A occupies and then apply that percentage to the total overhead.

So, the formula should be: (Department A's floor space / Total floor space) * Total overhead.

Let me plug in the numbers. Department A is 8,100 sq ft, total is 121,500. So 8,100 divided by 121,500. Let me compute that.

8,100 ÷ 121,500. Hmm, let's see. 121,500 divided by 100 is 1,215. So 8,100 ÷ 121,500 equals 8,100 / 121500.

Wait, maybe I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 100? No, wait, 8,100 divided by 121,500. Let me try dividing numerator and denominator by 100: 81 / 1215. Oh, that's better.

Now, 81 divided by 1215. Let me see if I can reduce this further. Let's try dividing numerator and denominator by 9. 81 ÷9=9; 1215 ÷9=135. So now it's 9/135. That simplifies to 1/15 because 9 ÷9=1 and 135 ÷9=15.

So 1/15 of the overhead goes to Department A. Since the total overhead is $97,500, I multiply 97,500 by 1/15.

97,500 ÷ 15. Let me compute that. 15 times 6,500 is 97,500 because 15 * 6,000 is 90,000, and 15 * 500 is 7,500. So yes, 6,500.

So Department A's share is $6,500. Looking at the options, option A is $6,500. So that's the answer.

The overhead for Department A is calculated based on its floor space proportion. Department A occupies 8,100 sq ft out of a total of 121,500 sq ft. The proportion is 8,100 / 121,500 = 1/15. Applying this to the total overhead of $97,500, Department A's share is $97,500 * (1/15) = $6,500.

Answer: A: $6,500
