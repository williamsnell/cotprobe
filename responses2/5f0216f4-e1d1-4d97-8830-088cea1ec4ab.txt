Question:

Which of the following statements about the immune system is NOT correct?

Options:

A: Innate immunity, also known as the adaptive immune response, relies on circulating phagocytes engulfing foreign substances.
B: Adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity.
C: Innate immunity activates a humoral response.
D: Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the immune system. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question is asking which statement is incorrect. The options are A through J, but the choices given are A to D in the question. So, the options are:

A: Innate immunity, also known as the adaptive immune response, relies on circulating phagocytes engulfing foreign substances.
B: Adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity.
C: Innate immunity activates a humoral response.
D: Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells.

I need to figure out which one is incorrect.

First, I'll recall what I know about immune system responses. Innate immunity is the first line of defense, which is adaptive. It's not the same as the adaptive response because adaptive is the later, more specific immune response, like B cell activation.

Adaptive immunity includes things like cell signaling (like B cells) and humoral (B cell receptor) immune responses. Innate immunity includes things like the adaptive T cells (which recognize antigens) and the initial response of phagocytes engulfing pathogens (like when bacteria or viruses are targeted).

So looking at the options:

Option A: Innate immunity uses phagocytes to engulf foreign substances. That sounds correct because phagocytes are part of the innate immune system, specifically the phagocytic cells that destroy pathogens.

Option B: Adaptive immunity is slower than innate. Wait, no. I thought that adaptive comes after innate. So if B is saying adaptive is slower, that's incorrect. Because I remember that adaptive is more specific and occurs after the initial recognition. So B is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but let me double-check. Innate is the first line, adaptive is the second. So before the adaptive response, there's the innate. So B says adaptive is slower than innate, which is wrong. So B is the incorrect statement.

Option C: Innate immunity activates a humoral response. Yes, that's correct. The humoral response is part of the adaptive immune system, which uses antibodies (B cells) to recognize and attack specific pathogens.

Option D: Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells. I think they are. Dendritic cells in the immune system (like in the B cell stage) present antigens to T cells. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is option B.

The incorrect statement is option B, as adaptive immunity is a faster response than innate immunity. 

Answer: B
