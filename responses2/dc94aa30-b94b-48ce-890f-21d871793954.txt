Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which formula correctly represents the given sentence. The sentence is: "If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll." Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I'll identify the propositions involved. Let's say:
- G represents "George enrolls"
- H represents "Harry enrolls"
- I represents "Ira enrolls"

The sentence is a conditional statement. It says that if George or Harry enrolls, then Ira doesn't. So structurally, that's an "if-then" situation. In logic, this is written as (G ∨ H) → ~I. That seems straightforward, but I need to make sure I'm applying the right logical connectives.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The main operator here is the implication (→), with the antecedent being "George or Harry enrolls" (G ∨ H), and the consequent being "Ira doesn't enroll" (~I). So yes, the formula should be (G ∨ H) → ~I.

Now I'll look at the options. Option A is (G ∨ H) ∨ ~I. Wait, that's a disjunction of two propositions, not an implication. So that's not matching. So A isn't the right choice.

Option B is (G ⊃ H) ∨ ~I. That's a bit confusing. Let me parse it. G ⊃ H means "if G then H," which is George enrolling leads to Harry enrolling. Then OR with ~I. So B is saying that either if G then H, or Ira doesn't enroll. That doesn't seem to match the original sentence which is an implication, not a disjunction. So B probably isn't right.

Option C: (G ⊃ ~H) ∨ I. Wait, that's an implication (if G then not H) OR I. But the original sentence is about the sum of G and H leading to not I. So that's not matching either.

Option D: (G ∨ H) ∨ I. That's another disjunction. So that's George OR Harry OR Ira enrolling. But the original sentence is about a condition when either G or H is true. So D seems unrelated.

Option E: (G ⊃ H) ∨ I. Hmm. G implies H (George enrolls implies Harry enrolls) OR Ira enrolls. That doesn't seem to fit the original statement.

Option F: (G ∨ I) → ~H. Wait, that's an implication where if George or Ira enrolls, then Harry doesn't. That's not the same as the original.

Option G: (G ∨ H) → ~I. Oh, wait, that's exactly what I initially thought. So G represents G OR H, and the consequent is ~I. So the formula is (G ∨ H) → ~I, which matches the sentence.

Option H: (G → I) ∨ H. That's (if G then I) OR Harry. That's different from the original, which was about a condition on G and H leading to not I.

Option I: (G ∨ H) → I. No, that's the opposite; it's (if G or H then Ira enrolls), which isn't what we want.

Option J: (G ∨ ~H) → I. So if George or Harry doesn't enroll, then Ira enrolls. That doesn't match.

So the only formula that exactly matches the sentence is option G: (G ∨ H) → ~I.

The correct symbolization of the sentence is (G ∨ H) → ~I.
