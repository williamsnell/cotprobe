Question:

An automobile service station performs oil changes and tire replacements, as well as other services. Sixty percent of its customers request an oil change, 30 percent request tire replacements, and 10 percent request both. A customer requests an oil change. What is the probability this customer does not request tire replacements?

D: 0.7
E: 0.75
F: 0.5
G: 0.2

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about an automobile service station. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question says that the service station has three types of customers: those who request an oil change, those who request tire replacements, and those who request both. The percentages given are 60% for oil changes, 30% for tire replacements, and 10% for both. Now, a customer comes in and requests an oil change. The question is asking for the probability that this customer does not request a tire replacement. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 0.1 to 0.933.

Hmm, so I think this is a problem involving conditional probability. Because once we know that a customer requested an oil change, we're looking for the probability that they didn't request a tire replacement. In probability terms, this is the probability of not A given that A has occurred, where A is the event of requesting an oil change.

Wait, actually, since the customer has already requested an oil change, we can think of it as given that the customer is in the oil change category. So, the sample space is now just the 60% who requested an oil change. But wait, the question says "does not request tire replacements." So, maybe I should think about the probabilities within the oil change requests.

Wait, the given percentages are for all customers, right? So, 60% request oil changes, 30% tire, and 10% both. That means some overlap occurs because 10% is the overlap.

I think the correct approach is to use the concept of conditional probability. The formula for conditional probability is P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A). So, here, P(B|A) is the probability that a customer does not request a tire replacement given that they have requested an oil change.

Wait, but B is the event that they don't request a tire. So, B would be the complement of the tire replacement event. So, B is the complement of the tire replacement event, meaning that if a customer doesn't request a tire, then they might have requested just an oil change or nothing else.

Let me think about the data. The 10% who request both oil and tire might be a part of the 60% who request oil. So, if I subtract the intersection from the oil change requests, I get the percentage who only have oil changes.

Wait, the total percentage requesting oil changes is 60%, which includes those who only oil change and those who do both. Similarly, the tire requests are 30%, including those who do both. The 10% who do both is the overlap.

So, if someone is in the oil change group, the percentage who also request a tire replacement is 10% of the total. But wait, no, because the 10% is the overlap between oil and tire. So, the percentage of oil change customers who also request tire is 10% of the total.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me structure this.

Let me denote:

- P(O) = 60% (probability of oil change)
- P(T) = 30% (probability of tire replacement)
- P(O ∩ T) = 10% (probability of both)

We need to find P(not T | O). That is, given that a customer has O, what's the probability they don't have T.

So, P(not T | O) = P(not T and O) / P(O).

But wait, not T and O is the same as O minus T, which is the part of O that doesn't include T. So, P(O) - P(O ∩ T) would be the probability that a customer has O but not T.

Alternatively, since not T is the complement of T, using De Morgan's law: P(not T | O) = 1 - P(T | O).

So, let's compute P(T | O). That's the probability that a customer requests a tire replacement given that they requested an oil change. So, using the formula:

P(T | O) = P(O ∩ T) / P(O) = 10% / 60% = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.

So, P(not T | O) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.833, which matches this calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, using the formula:

P(not T | O) = [P(O) - P(O ∩ T)] / P(O) = (60% - 10%) / 60% = 50% / 60% = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer should be 5/6, which is approximately 0.833.

The problem involves conditional probability. Given that a customer requests an oil change, we want the probability they do not request a tire replacement. Using formula:

P(not T | O) = 1 - P(T | O) = 1 - (P(O ∩ T) / P(O)) = 1 - (10% / 60%) = 1 - 1/6 ≈ 0.833.

Answer: I: 0.833.

**Answer:** I: 0.833
