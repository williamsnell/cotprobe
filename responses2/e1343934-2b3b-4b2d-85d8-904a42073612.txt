Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a mesonic atom made up of a proton and a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down.

The question is asking for the ground-state energy, the radius of the first Bohr orbit, and the energy and frequency for the n=1 to n=2 transition. Oh wait, but wait, I need to think in terms of Bohr's model here. But wait, the Bohr model is for hydrogen-like atoms, right? So the muon should be treated similarly, right?

So first, the charge of a muon is the same as that of an electron, which is negative. So the charge, q, for the muon is -e. The mass of the muon is 207 times the electron mass, m_e. So m_mu = 207 m_e.

I remember that the ground state energy in a hydrogen-like atom is given by E_n = - (Z² * (e²/(4πε₀)) * (m_e)/(2 * m_mu)) ) * (1/(n²)), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The formula for the ground state energy is E_1 = - (μ e^4) / (8 ε₀² h²) ), where μ is the reduced mass of the system. Or wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, another way: the radius of the nth Bohr orbit in the hydrogen-like atom is given by r_n = (n² * μ * a_0) / m_mu, where a_0 is the Bohr radius for hydrogen-like atoms. Oh wait, no, I think it's r_n = (n² * a_0) / Z², but wait, in this case, Z is 1 because it's a hydrogen-like ion (proton and muon), and the charge is -e. So Z is 1, right.

Wait, but for the Bohr model, the Bohr radius a_0 is (4π ε₀ h²)/(m_e e²). So substituting that into the radius formula for the Bohr model, r_n = (n² a_0 * μ) / m_mu, but wait, no, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the radius is given by r_n = (n² * (μ e²)/(4π ε₀ h)) ) / (m_mu?), I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the Bohr radius for hydrogen is a_0 = (4 π ε₀ ħ²)/(m e²), right. So for the muon, the Bohr radius would be a_mu = (4 π ε₀ ħ²)/(m_mu e²). Wait, but in the muon's case, the charge is -e, so the same formula applies but with the reduced mass. Hmm, but the Bohr radius is proportional to (μ e²)/(m e²) * a_0.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's try to think about the energy levels. The ground state energy for a hydrogen-like atom is E_n = - (Z² * e^4)/(8 ε₀² a_0²) * (μ)/(m_mu), but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E_n = - (μ e^4)/(8 ε₀² h²) * (1/(n²)), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the ground state energy is E_1 = - ( (e^2)/(8 π ε₀) )^2 * (m_mu)/(2 m_e) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, I think the energy levels in such a system (muon and proton) are similar to hydrogen but scaled by the reduced mass. The formula for the ground state energy of a hydrogen-like particle is E_1 = - ( (e^4)/(8 π² ε₀²) ) * ( (m_mu)/(2 m_e) ) * (1/(2 m_mu)) )) * something... Wait, perhaps I should look up the expression for the ground state energy of a muonic atom.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are given by E_n = - ( (e^2)/(8 π ε₀ a_0) )^2 * (μ)/(m_mu) ) * (1/(n²)), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's E_n = - ( (μ e^4) )/(8 ε₀² h²) * (1/(n²)) ), but I'm not sure about the constants.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Rydberg's constant. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1, but in this case, the Rydberg constant would be scaled by the reduced mass and the electron mass. Wait, no, the Rydberg formula is R = (m_e)/(2 m_mu) * (e^2/(4 π ε₀))². Hmm, perhaps I'm getting off track.

Wait, another approach: the ground state energy (n=1) for a hydrogen-like system is E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε₀))^2 * (m_mu) )/(2 m_e) ) * (1/(1^2)). Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, the ground state energy can be written as E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε₀ a_0))^2 ) * (μ)/(m_mu) * (1/(2)) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula for the ground state energy. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is E_1 = - ( (μ e^4) )/(8 ε_0^2 h^2) * (1/(m_mu)). Wait, because the Bohr radius a_0 is h/(2 π m_e e), so perhaps substituting that into the formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the ground state energy is E_1 = - ( (μ e^4) )/(8 ε_0^2 (4 π ε_0)^2 h²) ) * something? No, wait. Let me think again.

The energy levels for the hydrogen-like atom are E_n = - (Z^2 * (e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 h^2)) ) * ( (μ)/(m_e) ) * (1/(n²)) )? Not sure if that's right.

Alternatively, perhaps the ground state energy is E_1 = - ( (μ e^4) )/(8 ε_0^2 (4 π ε_0)^2 h^2) ) * (something) )... Hmm, perhaps I should instead write the formula for the ground state energy in terms of μ, m_mu, and e.

Wait, another approach: The ground state energy for a hydrogen-like ion with a mass μ and charge -e is E_1 = - ( (μ e^4) )/(8 ε_0^2 (4 π ε_0)^2 h^2) ) * (1/(2 m_mu)) ), I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for the ground state energy.

Wait, alternatively, I think the ground state energy (n=1) is E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 a_0))^2 * (mu)/(2 m_mu) ) ). Hmm, but a_0 is h/(2 π m_e e), so substituting that in, we get E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 h/(2 π m_e e)) ) )^2 * (mu)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, let's compute that. Let me compute the denominator inside the square first: denominator is (8 π ε_0) * (h/(2 π m_e e)) )? Wait, wait a second, a_0 = (4 π ε_0 ħ)^2/(m_e e²), but ħ is h/(2 π), so a_0 = (4 π ε_0 (h/(2 π))^2 )/( m_e e² ) = (4 π ε_0 h² )/(4 π² m_e e² ) ) = ( ε_0 h² )/( π m_e e² ). So 1/(a_0) is π m_e e^2)/(ε_0 h²).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck in the weeds here. Let me think about the formula for the ground state energy. For hydrogen-like atoms, it's E_1 = - ( (Z^2) (e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 a_0^2) ) * (μ)/(m_mu) ), but I'm not sure about the exact factors.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: since the Bohr model says that the energy levels are proportional to (Z^2 μ)/(m_mu). So the ground state energy is E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0))^2 * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) ) * (1/(1^2)) )

Wait, but I think the correct formula for the ground state energy is E_1 = - ( (μ e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 h^2) ) ) * (1/(2 m_mu)) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, perhaps E_1 = - ( (μ e^4 ) )/(8 ε_0^2 h^2 ) * (1/(2 m_mu)) )

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of Rydberg's constant. The Rydberg constant R is given by R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0))^2. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the energy levels are given by E_n = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 a_0 ))^2 ) * (μ)/(m_mu) ) * (1/(n²)).

Wait, no, perhaps it's E_n = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0))^2 * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) ) * (1/(n^2)).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom, but with a reduced mass. The general formula is E_n = - ( (μ e^4) )/(8 ε_0^2 h^2) ) * (1/(2 m_mu n²) ) ). Wait, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the ground state energy is E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 a_0))^2 ) * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, but a_0 is h/(2 π m_e e), so substituting that in.

So E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 (h/(2 π m_e e)) ))^2 ) * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Simplify this expression. Let me compute the denominator first: the denominator is (8 π ε_0) * (h/(2 π m_e e)) ).

Wait, 8 π ε_0 * (h/(2 π m_e e)) ) = (8 π ε_0 h) / (2 π m_e e) ) = (4 ε_0 h)/(m_e e).

So putting it all together, E_1 = - ( (e^2 * m_e e )^2 ) / ( (4 ε_0 h)^2 ) ) * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1/(h^2)) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find E_1 in terms of known constants. Another thought: the ground state energy can be written as E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0))^2 * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, but maybe I should look for the expression using Rydberg's constant. The Rydberg constant R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0))^2. So R = (e^4 m_e)/(32 π^2 ε_0^2 μ^2} ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ground state energy is E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 a_0))^2 ) * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, let me compute that. a_0 is (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(m_e e^2), so 1/a_0 is (m_e e^2)/(4 π ε_0 ħ^2). So putting that into the expression:

E_1 = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 * (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(m_e e^2)) ))^2 * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1).

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Inside the square: e^2/(8 π ε_0 * (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(m_e e^2)) )

Denominator is 8 π ε_0 * (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(m_e e²) ) = [8 π ε_0 *4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(m_e e²)} ] = (32 π² ε_0² ħ^2)/(m_e e²).

So the entire term becomes (e^2) divided by that: e² / [ (32 π² ε_0² ħ^2)/(m_e e²) ) ] = (e^4 m_e) / (32 π² ε_0² ħ^2).

So the square of that is (e^8 m_e²) / ( (32 π² ε_0² ħ^2)^2 ).

Hmm, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ is given by μ = (m_e * m_mu) / (m_e + m_mu ). Since m_mu = 207 m_e, the reduced mass is μ = (m_e * 207 m_e) / (208 m_e) ) = 207/(208) m_e ≈ m_e.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute that correctly. μ = (m_e * m_mu) / (m_e + m_mu) ). m_mu is 207 m_e, so denominator is m_e + 207 m_e = 208 m_e. So μ = (m_e * 207 m_e) ) / (208 m_e) )= (207 m_e^2 ) / (208 m_e ) = (207/208) m_e ≈ 0.995 m_e.

Wait, that's a very small mass, but that's why the Bohr radius is small. But perhaps for the energy, μ is the key.

So the energy levels of the atom are given by E_n = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 a_0))^2 ) * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1/(n²)).

Wait, but a_0 is (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/( m_e e² ), so 1/a_0 is (m_e e²)/(4 π ε_0 ħ^2 ).

Putting it all together, the expression for E_1 is:

E_1 = - (e^4 m_e^2) / ( (8 π ε_0)^2 (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)^2 ) ) * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * 1/(1^2) )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find E_1 in terms of known constants.

Let me consider that for hydrogen, the ground state energy is E_1 = -13.6 eV. But in this case, the reduced mass is (207/208) m_e, which is almost m_e. So the energy will be similar to the hydrogen atom, but scaled by the reduced mass.

Another approach: the Bohr radius a0 is a0 = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(μ e²). So the ground state energy is E_1 = - (e²/(8 π ε_0 a0))^2 * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, let's compute that:

e²/(8 π ε_0 a0) = e²/(8 π ε_0 * (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(μ e²) )) = e² * μ e² / (8 π ε_0 *4 π ε_0 ħ² )).

Denominator: 8 π ε_0 *4 π ε_0 ħ² = 32 π² ε_0^2 ħ^2.

So e² * μ e² / (32 π² ε_0^2 ħ^2) ) = μ e^4/(32 π² ε_0^2 ħ^2).

So [e²/(8 π ε_0 a0)]^2 = [μ e^4/(32 π² ε_0^2 ħ^2)]^2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me compute the square of (e²/(8 π ε_0 a0)).

E_1 = - [ (e²/(8 π ε_0 a_0 ))^2 * (μ)/(2 m_mu) ) ].

Since a_0 is (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(μ e^2), then 1/a_0 is (μ e^2)/(4 π ε_0 ħ^2).

So e^2/(8 π ε_0 a_0) = e^2 * (μ e^2) ) / (8 π ε_0 *4 π ε_0 ħ^2 ) ) = e^4 μ / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^2 ).

Now, [e^2/(8 π ε_0 a_0)]^2 = (e^8 μ^2) )/( (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^2 )^2 ) ).

Wait, but E_1 is - (this value) multiplied by (μ)/(2 m_mu) ).

Putting it all together:

E_1 = - [ (e^8 μ^2 )/( (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^2 )^2 ) ) ] * (μ)/(2 m_mu) )

Hmm, this seems too complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ground state energy using the formula E_1 = - ( (μ e^4 )/(8 ε_0^2 h^2) ) * (1/(2 m_mu) ) ).

Wait, but h is Planck's constant, so perhaps I can substitute that in. Let me compute the constants:

μ = (m_e * m_mu) / (m_e + m_mu) ) = (m_e * 207 m_e) / (208 m_e) ) = (207 m_e^2 ) / (208 m_e ) ) = (207/208) m_e ≈ 0.995 m_e.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, I can keep μ as 207/(208) m_e.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the ground state energy as E_1 = - ( (μ e^4 )/(8 ε_0^2 (4 π ε_0)^2 h^2) ) * (1/(2 m_mu) ) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me think of the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom with reduced mass μ. The general formula is E_n = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 a_0))^2 ) * (μ)/(m_mu) ) * (1/(n²)).

Wait, but a_0 is (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(μ e²), so 1/a_0 is (μ e²)/(4 π ε_0 ħ² ). Substituting that into E_1:

E_1 = - ( (e^4 μ^2) ) / ( (4 π ε_0)^2 (4 π ε_0 ħ^2 ) )^2 ) * (μ)/(m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, this is getting too messy. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.

Another thought: the Bohr radius for a hydrogen-like atom is a = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(m e²). So the ground state energy is E = - ( (e^2/(8 π ε_0 a))^2 ) * (μ)/(m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Wait, let's compute a first. a = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(m e²), so 1/a = (m e²)/(4 π ε_0 ħ²).

Then, e^2/(8 π ε_0 a) = e^2 * m e^2 ) / (8 π ε_0 *4 π ε_0 ħ^2 ) ) = (m e^4 ) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^2 ).

So (e^2/(8 π ε_0 a))^2 = (m^2 e^8) )/( (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^2 )^2 ).

Then, E_1 = - ( (m^2 e^8 )/( (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^2 )^2 ) ) * (μ)/(m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

Hmm, but this doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the ground state energy in terms of the Rydberg constant.

The Rydberg constant R is given by R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0))^2. So R = (e^4 m_e)/(32 π^2 ε_0^2 μ^2).

Wait, the ground state energy of a hydrogen-like atom is E_1 = - R * (1/(n^2)).

So for n=1, E_1 = - R.

Wait, but R is (e^4 m_e)/(32 π^2 ε_0^2 μ^2). So E_1 = - (e^4 m_e)/(32 π^2 ε_0^2 μ^2 ).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the ground state energy is E_1 = - ( (e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 a_0^2) ) * (μ)/(m_mu) ) * (1/(1^2)).

But a_0 is the Bohr radius, which is (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(m_e e^2). So 1/a_0 is (m_e e^2)/(4 π ε_0 ħ^2 ). Substituting that into E_1:

E_1 = - ( e^4/(8 ε_0^2 (4 π ε_0 ħ^2/(m_e e^2))^2 ) * μ )/( m_mu ) ).

Wait, let's compute (1/a_0)^2: (m_e e^2/(4 π ε_0 ħ^2 ))^2 = ( m_e^2 e^4 ) / ( (4 π ε_0 )^2 ħ^4 ) ).

So, e^4/(8 ε_0^2 (1/a_0)^2 ) ) = e^4 * (4 π ε_0 )^2 ħ^4 )/(8 ε_0^2 m_e^2 e^4 )).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (4 π ε_0 )^2 ħ^4.

Denominator: 8 ε_0^2 m_e^2 e^4.

Wait, but the numerator has e^4, which cancels with the denominator's e^4.

So, after simplification: (16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 )/(8 ε_0^2 m_e^2 ) ) = (2 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 )/( ε_0^2 m_e^2 ) ) = (2 π^2 ε_0 ħ^4 )/( m_e^2 ) ).

Wait, but this seems to have units of (Energy * Length^4), which doesn't make sense. I think I must have made a mistake in substituting.

Wait, let's go back. Let's compute E_1 correctly.

E_1 = - (e^4/(8 ε_0^2 a_0^2)) ) * (μ)/(m_mu).

But a_0 = (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(m_e e^2).

So a_0^2 = (16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 )/( m_e^2 e^4 ).

Then, e^4/(8 ε_0^2 a_0^2 ) ) = e^4 * m_e^2 e^4 * 8 ε_0^2 )/( 16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 *8 ε_0^2 )).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

e^4/(8 ε_0^2 a_0^2) = e^4 * m_e^2 e^4 * 8 ε_0^2 ) / (16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 *8 ε_0^2 )).

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute a_0^2 first.

a_0 = (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(m_e e^2).

So a_0^2 = (16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4)/( m_e^2 e^4 ).

Then, e^4/(8 ε_0^2 a_0^2 ) = e^4 * m_e^2 e^4 * 8 ε_0^2 ) / (16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 *8 ε_0^2 )

Wait, that's getting too confusing. Let me compute it more carefully.

e^4/(8 ε_0^2 a_0^2) = e^4 * m_e^2 e^4 *8 ε_0^2 ) / (16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 *8 ε_0^2 * (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(m_e e^2 )) )

Wait, perhaps I'm not doing this correctly. Let me compute a_0^2:

a_0 = (4 π ε_0 ħ^2)/(m_e e^2).

a_0^2 = (16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 )/( m_e^2 e^4 ).

So e^4/(8 ε_0^2 a_0^2 ) = e^4 * m_e^2 e^4 * 8 ε_0^2 ) / (16 π^2 ε_0^2 ħ^4 *8 ε_0^2 * ... )

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me compute it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Rydberg formula for the energy.

The Rydberg constant R is given by R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

So, R = (e^4 m_e)/(32 π^2 ε_0^2 μ^2).

Then, the ground state energy is E_1 = - R * (1/(1^2)) ) = - R.

Wait, but that can't be right because the Bohr radius is smaller, so the energy should be more negative.

Wait, no, the Rydberg constant is always positive, so E_1 = - R.

Wait, but R is positive, so E_1 is negative. That makes sense.

So E_1 = - R, where R is the Rydberg constant.

Now, R = (e^4 m_e)/(32 π^2 ε_0^2 μ^2).

But μ = 207/208 m_e, because m_mu = 207 m_e, and the reduced mass is μ = (m_e * m_mu)/(m_e + m_mu) ) = (m_e * 207 m_e)/(208 m_e) ) = 207/(208) m_e.

So substituting μ into R: R = (e^4 m_e)/(32 π^2 ε_0^2 ( (207/208 m_e )^2 ) ).

Simplifying: R = (e^4 m_e) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 (207^2 / 208^2 m_e^2 )) ) = (e^4 m_e * 208^2 ) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 * 207^2 m_e^2 )).

Simplify m_e terms: m_e cancels, m_e^2 terms: m_e^2 in numerator and denominator gives m_e^0, so m_e^2 in numerator and denominator: m_e^2 / m_e^2 = 1.

So R = (e^4 * 208^2 ) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 * 207^2 ) ).

Now, e^4 = (4)^2 (e^2)^2 = 16 e^4? Wait, no, e^4 is (e^2)^2.

Wait, let me compute the numerical value.

Compute 208/207 = approximately 1.00485.

So (208/207)^2 ≈ 1.00979.

So R ≈ (16) * (1.00979) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2) ) = (16 * 1.00979 ) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ) ) = (16.15664) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ) ) = 0.50489 / (π^2 ε_0^2 ).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me compute the numerical value step by step.

Compute 208^2 = (200 + 8)^2 = 200^2 + 2*200*8 +8^2 = 40000 +3200 +64=43264.

Similarly, 207^2 = (200+7)^2=200^2 +2*200*7 +7^2=40000 +2800 +49=42849.

So R = (e^4 * 208^2) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 * 207^2) ) = (e^4 * 43264 ) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 *42849 ).

Simplify 43264 /42849 ≈1.000383.

So R ≈ (e^4 *1.000383 ) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ) ) = (e^4 *1.000383 ) / (32 π^2 ε_0^2 ).

Now, e=1.6e-10 m, so e^2=2.56e-20 m², e^4=6.5536e-40 m^4.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Rydberg constant using known values.

The Rydberg constant for hydrogen is R_H = 1.097373e7 m⁻¹.

But in this case, since the Bohr radius is much smaller, the Rydberg constant will be larger. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can compute R using the formula R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

But given that μ = (m_e * m_mu)/(m_e + m_mu) ) = (m_e * 207 m_e)/(208 m_e) ) = 207/(208) m_e.

So, μ = 207/(208) m_e.

Substituting into R: R = (m_e/(2*(207/208) m_e )) ) * ( (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2 ) ) = (208/(2*207 )) ) * (e^4/(16 π² ε_0² )).

Simplifying: R = (208/(414 )) * (e^4/(16 π² ε_0² )) ) = (0.5004878 ) * (e^4/(16 π² ε_0² )) ).

So R = (e^4 *0.5004878 )/(16 π² ε_0² ).

Now, e=1.6e-10 m, so e^4 = (1.6e-10 )^4 = (2.56e-20 )^2= 6.5536e-40 m^4.

Wait, no, e^4 is (1.6e-10 m)^4 = (1.6)^4 (1e-10)^4 m^4 = 6.5536e-40 m^4.

Wait, no, wait: (1.6e-10 m)^4 = (1.6)^4 * (1e-10)^4 * m^4 = 6.5536e-40 m^4.

So, putting it all together:

R = (6.5536e-40 m^4 * 0.5004878 ) / (16 π² * (8.854e-12 C²/m² )) ) * (1/m).

Wait, but this is getting really complicated. Let me compute the denominator first.

Denominator: 16 π² ε_0² = 16 * (3.1416)^2 * (8.854e-12 C²/m² ).

Compute 3.1416^2 ≈9.8696.

So denominator: 16 *9.8696 *8.854e-12 ≈ 158.01 *8.854e-12 ≈ 1398.0e-12 ≈1.398e-9 C²/m².

Wait, but 16 *9.8696 = 158.01, and 158.01 *8.854e-12 = approx 1.398e-9.

So denominator is 1.398e-9 C²/m².

Now, numerator:6.5536e-40 m^4 *0.5004878 ≈3.2794e-40 m^4.

So R =3.2794e-40 m^4 / (1.398e-9 C²/m² ) ) = (3.2794e-40 / 1.398e-9 ) ) m^5 / C².

Compute 3.2794e-40 /1.398e-9 = (3.2794 /1.398 )e-31 ≈2.349e-31.

So R ≈2.349e-31 m^5 / C².

Now, the ground state energy for hydrogen is E_1 = - R.

So E_1 = -2.349e-31 J m^5/C².

Wait, but J is kg m² / s², so E_1 would be in kg m² / s² * m^5 / C².

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting the Rydberg formula. Let me check it again.

Wait, the Rydberg formula is R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

So substituting μ =207/(208) m_e.

So R = (m_e/(2*(207/208) m_e )) ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2 = (208/(2*207 )) ) * (e^4/(16 π² ε_0^2 )).

So R = (104/(207 )) ) * (e^4/(16 π² ε_0^2 )).

Wait, 208/(2*207) = 104/207.

So R = (104/207 ) * (e^4/(16 π² ε_0^2 )).

So R = (e^4 *104 )/(207 *16 π² ε_0^2 )) = (e^4 *104/(3312 π² ε_0^2 )) ) = (e^4 * (104/3312 )) )/( π² ε_0^2 ) ).

Simplify 104/3312: 104 ÷4=26, 3312 ÷4=828. So 26/828 =13/414 ≈0.0311.

So R ≈0.0311 e^4/( π² ε_0^2 ).

Now, compute R numerically.

e=1.6e-10 m.

e^4= (1.6)^4 * (1e-10)^4 =6.5536e-40 m^4.

So, R ≈0.0311 *6.5536e-40 m^4 / ( π² ε_0^2 ).

Compute 0.0311 *6.5536e-40 = approx 2.048e-40.

So R ≈2.048e-40 m^4 / ( π² ε_0^2 ).

Now, compute the denominator: π^2 ε_0^2.

π^2 ≈9.8696.

ε_0 =8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²) =8.854e-12 C²/(N·m²).

So, π² ε_0² ≈9.8696 * (8.854e-12 )^2 ≈9.8696 *7.839e-23 ≈7.73e-22.

So, R ≈2.048e-40 m^4 / (7.73e-22 C² ) ) = (2.048e-40 /7.73e-22 ) ) m^4 C^{-2}.

Compute 2.048e-40 /7.73e-22 = approx 2.657e-19.

So R ≈2.657e-19 m^4 C^{-2}.

Now, the ground state energy E_1 = - R.

So E_1 = -2.657e-19 J m^5/C².

Wait, but this seems too small. I think I must have made a mistake in substituting the Rydberg formula.

Wait, perhaps the Rydberg formula should be R_H = 1.097e7 m^{-1}, and in this case, the Rydberg constant would be larger because the Bohr radius is smaller. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the ground state energy using the formula E_1 = -13.6 eV * Z², but that doesn't account for the reduced mass or the Bohr radius.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the ground state energy in terms of the Bohr radius is E_1 = -13.6 eV * (m_e/(m_mu)) * (a_0/a_0)^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The energy levels for a hydrogen-like atom are given by E_n = -13.6 eV * Z² * (m_e/(m_mu)) * (1/a_0)^2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me check.

Actually, the energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms are given by E_n = -13.6 eV * Z² * (m_e/(m_mu)) * (1/a_0)^2.

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think.

Wait, the Bohr radius a_0 is given by a_0 = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(m_e e²).

So, rearranging, m_e = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(a_0 e²).

Thus, m_e/m_mu = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(a_0 e²) ) / (207 m_e ) = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(a_0 e²) ) * (1/(207 m_e )) ) = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(a_0 e² * 207 m_e ).

Wait, but m_e = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(a_0 e²), so m_e * 207 m_e = 207 * (4 π ε_0 ħ²)^2/(a_0 e^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ground state energy using the formula E_1 = -13.6 eV * (m_e/(m_mu)) * (1/a_0)^2.

But wait, that would be assuming that the Bohr radius is the same as in the hydrogen atom. But here, the Bohr radius is smaller because of the reduced mass. So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E_1 = -13.6 eV * (m_e/(m_mu)) * (1/a_0)^2 * (m_mu/(m_e)).

Wait, that's because the reduced mass affects the energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ground state energy using the formula E_1 = -13.6 eV * (m_e/(m_mu)) * (1/a_0)^2 * (m_mu/(m_e)).

Wait, that would be (m_mu/m_e) * (m_e/m_mu) )=1, so that doesn't change. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula E_1 = -13.6 eV * (m_e/(m_mu)) * (1/a_0)^2 * (m_mu/m_e).

Which would be (m_mu/m_e) * (m_e/m_mu) )=1. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E_1 = -13.6 eV * (m_e/m_mu) * (1/a_0)^2.

But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The energy levels for a hydrogen-like atom are given by E_n = -13.6 eV * (Z^2) * (m_e/(m_mu)) * (1/a_0)^2.

Wait, but why m_e/m_mu? Because the reduced mass affects the energy.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So, the mass ratio is m_e/m_mu = (207 m_e)/m_mu =207 m_e/m_mu.

Wait, no, m_mu =207 m_e, so m_e/m_mu =1/207.

So, the factor is (m_e/m_mu) =1/207.

Therefore, E_1 = -13.6 eV * (1/207) * (1/a_0)^2.

But wait, that can't be correct because the Bohr radius a_0 is different.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the formula. Let me look for the correct formula.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is E_1 = -13.6 eV * (m_e/m_mu) * (1/a_0)^2.

So, E_1 = -13.6 eV * (1/207) * (1/a_0)^2.

So, substituting a_0 = (4 π ε_0 ħ²)/(m_e e²).

So, 1/a_0 = m_e e²/(4 π ε_0 ħ²).

So, (1/a_0)^2 = m_e² e^4/(16 π² ε_0² ħ^4).

So, E_1 = -13.6 eV * (1/207) * (m_e^2 e^4 )/(16 π² ε_0² ħ^4 ).

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Let me compute each term.

First, m_e is in kg, e is in coulombs, ε_0 is in farads*meter², ħ is in joule-seconds.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead use the Rydberg formula correctly.

Let me try again. The Rydberg formula is R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e²/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

We can compute R as:

R = (m_e/(2 μ)) * (e^4)/(16 π² ε_0² ).

Substituting μ =207 m_e / (208 m_e )=207/208 m_e.

So, R = (m_e/(2*(207/208 m_e )) ) * (e^4)/(16 π² ε_0^2 ).

Simplify m_e terms:

m_e cancels, denominator: 2 * (207/208 )= (414/208 )= (207/104 ).

So, R = (104/207 ) * (e^4)/(16 π² ε_0^2 ).

So R = (104 e^4 )/(207 *16 π² ε_0^2 ).

Now, compute each term:

e =1.6e-10 m.

e^4=(1.6e-10 )^4= (2.56e-20 )^2=6.5536e-40 m^4.

ε_0=8.854e-12 C²/(N m² )=8.854e-12 C² m^{-1} N^{-1}.

So, ε_0^2 = (8.854e-12 )^2=7.839e-22 C^4 m^{-2}.

Now, 16 π² ε_0^2:

π^2=9.8696.

16 *9.8696=158.01.

158.01 *7.839e-22=1.398e-22.

So, denominator:1.398e-22.

So, R= (104 *6.5536e-40 )/(207 *1.398e-22 ).

Compute numerator:104 *6.5536e-40=6.794e-38.

Denominator:207 *1.398e-22=2.856e-22.

So, R=6.794e-38 /2.856e-22=2.374e-16.

So, R≈2.374e-16 m^{-1}.

Wait, but the Rydberg constant for hydrogen is about 1.097e7 m^{-1}.

Hmm, I think I must have made a mistake in substituting the Rydberg formula.

Wait, perhaps the Rydberg formula should be R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

Wait, let me compute R using this formula.

So, R = (m_e)/(2 μ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

Substituting μ =207/208 m_e.

So,

R = (m_e)/(2*(207/208 m_e )) ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

Simplify m_e:

m_e cancels in numerator and denominator.

So, R = (1)/(2*(207/208 )) ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

Compute denominator:2*207/208=414/208=207/104.

So, R= (104/207 ) * (e^2/(4 π ε_0 ))^2.

Now, e^2= (1.6e-10 )^2=4e-20 m².

ε_0=8.854e-12 C²/(N m² ).

So, e^2/(4 π ε_0 )= (4e-20 )/(4 *3.1416 *8.854e-12 ))= (4e-20 )/(1.027e-28 )= 3.9e8 m.

Wait, no, let me compute (e^2)/(4 π ε_0 ).

So,

e^2= (1.6e-10 )^2=4e-20 m².

4 π ε_0 =4 *3.1416 *8.854e-12=4*3.1416=12.566; 12.566 *8.854e-12=1.097e-22.

Wait, 12.566 *8.854e-12= (12 *8.854 ) + (0.566 *8.854 )=106.08 +0.320=106.40e-12≈1.064e-10.

Wait, no, 12.566 *8.854e-12= (12.566 *8.854 ) *1e-12.
