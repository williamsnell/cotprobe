Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Pleistocene epoch. I need to figure out how long it lasted. The options are A to J, each with different years. I'm a bit rusty on my geology, but I'll try to recall what I know.

The Pleistocene era is a big time period. I think it starts around 1.5 million years ago and ends around 100,000 years ago. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh right, the Pleistocene is the last ice age, which started around 1.5 million years ago and ended around 100,000 years ago. So, that's a span of about 1.5 million to 100,000 years. So, from, say, 1.5 million years ago to 100,000 years ago. That's a difference of 1.4 million years, but the options don't have that exact number.

Looking at the options, option A is 500,000 years. That's much longer than the Pleistocene. Option B is 50,000 years, which is shorter. Then C is 200k, D is 2k, E is 100k, F is 1M, G is 1k, H is 5k, I is 20k, J is 10k.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another way to think: the Pleistocene started with the Last Glacial Maximum, which was when the ice sheet was biggest. That's around 11,000 years ago. But the Pleistocene itself, I think, started much earlier, probably around 1.5 million years ago. So from about 1.5 million to 100,000 years ago. So the duration is roughly 1.5 million to 100k, which is about 1.4 million years. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total duration from the start of the Pleistocene to the end, which is about 1.4 million years.

But the options don't have 1.4 million. Hmm. Let me look again. Oh, wait. The question asks, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Wait, no, the question is about the Pleistocene duration, not about the last letter. Oh, sorry. It's a multiple-choice with the options A to J, each representing years. So the question is: which option is correct for the duration.

I think the correct answer is that the Pleistocene lasted approximately 1.4 million years. But the options don't have that. Wait, let me check again. Oh, wait, the options are A through J, and the numbers are as follows:

A: 500,000 years  
B: 50,000 years  
C: 200,000 years  
D: 2,000 years  
E: 100,000 years  
F: 1,000,000 years  
G: 1,000 years  
H: 5,000 years  
I: 20,000 years  
J: 10,000 years  

Wait, so the correct answer isn't listed here. But perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the exact duration. The Pleistocene lasted from the end of the last ice age to the present. The Last Ice Age ended in 10,000 years ago. Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the Pleistocene lasted until 100,000 years ago, but that's not accurate.

Wait, no. The Pleistocene began around 1.5 million years ago and ended around 100,000 years ago. So the total duration is about 1.4 million years. But the options don't have 1.4 million. Closest is option C, which is 200,000 years. Wait, that's 200k, but the correct duration is around 1.4 million.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the Pleistocene lasted about 11,000-15,000 years. Let me think again. So if it started around 11,000 years ago, and ended around 100,000 years ago, then the duration is 100,000 - 11,000 = 89,000 years. So approximately 90,000 years. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the last ice age, which could be up to 100,000 years ago. So if the Pleistocene started around 1.5 million years ago, then the duration is 1.5M - 100k = 1.4M years. But again, that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbers. Let me think again. The options:

A: 500,000 years â†’ that's 500k.  
B:50k  
C:200k  
D:2k  
E:100k  
F:1M  
G:1k  
H:5k  
I:20k  
J:10k  

The correct answer is not listed. Wait, but I remember that the Pleistocene lasted about 11,000 to 15,000 years. So the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the last ice age, which is 100,000 years ago. So the Pleistocene lasted until 100k ago, which is 100,000 years. But that's option E. Alternatively, the Pleistocene's duration is about 11,000 years. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to find the correct fact. The Pleistocene started about 1.5 million years ago and ended around 100,000 years ago. So the total duration is about 1.4 million years. But the options don't have that. The options have 500,000 (A), 50k (B), 200k (C), 1M (F), 1k (G), etc. So perhaps the question is trying to get the duration until 100,000 years ago. Because the Pleistocene itself was just part of the last ice age.

Wait, another thought: the last ice age, or Last Glacial Maximum, was around 11,000 years ago. So the Pleistocene, which was the last ice age, ended around 100,000 years ago. So the Pleistocene lasted until 100,000 years ago. But the options don't have 100k. The closest is option E:100,000 years. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but the question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Wait, no, the question says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Wait, no, the question is about the Pleistocene duration, not the last character. So perhaps the correct answer is E:100k years.

Alternatively, another approach: I think the Pleistocene lasted until ~100,000 years ago. So the correct option is E:100,000 years.

The Pleistocene epoch lasted until approximately 100,000 years ago. This period, known as the Last Ice Age, began around 1.5 million years ago and ended around 100,000 years ago. The question asks for the duration of the Pleistocene epoch, and the closest option provided is 100,000 years.

Answer: E
