Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Nagel clarifying absolutism. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The question is asking what Nagel says about absolutism. The options are A through I, each describing different views on absolutism. Absoluteism, in legal terms, is the principle that certain actions are inherently unlawful and should not be justified by reason. So, the question is about what Nagel specifically clarifies about this concept.

I remember reading that absolutism has been a significant concept in legal theory, especially in cases like the U.S. Supreme Court cases. One major case that comes to mind is Searle v. New York State of New York. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld the use of force in the absence of a compelling reason to harm others, which was a key point in absolutism. They held that the principle of preventing such actions is a fundamental legal principle.

Looking at the options again: 

A: only sometimes prevent murder
B: never prevent murder
C: only sometimes avoid murder
D: always encourage murder
E: consider murder as a last resort
F: encourage murder under certain circumstances
G: only sometimes encourage murder
H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations
I: avoid murder at all costs

In Searle v. New York, the Court emphasized that preventing murder is a fundamental principle. They didn't say it's never the case, so B is probably incorrect. They did say it's a fundamental principle, so A and B are likely not correct.

The Court's reasoning was that the principle applies not just to murder but to all acts where harm is done, which is the essence of absolutism. So the correct answer would be about the principle of preventing such actions.

Looking at the options, option H says "avoid murder except in self-defense situations." Wait, that doesn't sound right. The Court didn't say that. They didn't say it's never the case. So maybe option H is incorrect.

Option G is "only sometimes encourage murder." That also doesn't seem right. The Court didn't say it's only sometimes; they said it's a fundamental principle.

Option I says "avoid murder at all costs," which is too strong and not what the Supreme Court said. They didn't specify that; they just said that preventing such actions is a fundamental principle.

Option C: "only sometimes avoid murder." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. The Court said that all lawful actions should be prohibited, so it's more about preventing rather than avoiding.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the options. Let me think again. The correct answer, as per my understanding, is about the principle of preventing murder being a fundamental legal principle. The Supreme Court didn't explicitly say it's never the case (which would be B), nor did they say it's only sometimes (which would be G), etc.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, option G: only sometimes encourage murder. No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the exact wording. Let me think about the legal principle again. The Supreme Court in Searle said that the principle of preventing criminal acts is a fundamental principle of the law. So the correct answer would be the one that reflects that.

Looking at the options, option I says "avoid murder at all costs," which is too restrictive. The Court didn't say that. Option H says "avoid murder except in self-defense situations," which is also not what the Court said. So perhaps none of the options exactly match, but the closest is option I because it's about not all the time, but that's not the exact statement.

Wait, no. The Supreme Court didn't say that. The Court did say that the principle is a fundamental principle of the law. So the correct answer must be about the fundamental principleâ€”so the answer is about the principle itself, not the application.

Looking again, the correct answer is option H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations. Or is it another option?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall the exact wording from Nagel's work. Nagel's work is about the history of the legal concept of absolutism. In his discussions, he probably clarified that absolutism is the principle that certain acts are inherently unlawful and should be prevented.

So the options should reflect that. The correct answer would be about preventing such acts. Option H says "avoid murder except in self-defense situations," which is incorrect because the Court didn't say that. Option G says "only sometimes encourage murder," which is also incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, option I is "avoid murder at all costs," which is too strong.

Wait, the correct answer is option H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations. No, that's not correct. The Court said it's a fundamental principle, so it's not only sometimes. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H. No, I don't think so. The Court didn't say that. The Court said that the principle is a fundamental principle of the law, so it's not about only sometimes, but always.

So looking back, the correct answer should be the one that states that the principle is a fundamental principle of the law. The options don't have that, but the closest is option H. Or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the exact wording: "Nagel clarifies that absolutism is the view that we should" and then the options.

The correct answer should be the one that captures the essence of absolutism, which is that certain actions are inherently unlawful and should not be justified. So, the answer is about preventing such actions.

Looking at the options, option H says "avoid murder except in self-defense situations." Wait, no, that's incorrect because the Court didn't say that. Option I is "avoid murder at all costs," which is too extreme.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option I, but that's not correct either.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is option H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations. No, that can't be right. I'm stuck. Alternatively, the correct answer is option H, which is the only option that correctly reflects the concept. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: looking for the exact wording from Nagel. In his book, "The Concept of Law," he discusses absolutism. He says that the principle is a fundamental principle of the law. So the answer is the option that says that.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly say that. The closest is option H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations. No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option I, but I don't think so. I'm a bit stuck here, but I'll proceed.

The correct answer is based on the understanding that absolutism refers to the principle that certain acts are inherently unlawful and should not be justified. The Supreme Court case Searle v. New York supports this, stating that the principle is a fundamental law of the land. The options do not explicitly state this, but the closest correct interpretation is that absolutism is the view that legal actions should be prevented. 

Answer: H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations.
