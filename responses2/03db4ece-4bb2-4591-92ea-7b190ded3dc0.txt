Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an ancient city called Cahokia. The question is asking about how many people lived there and the population. The options are A to J, each giving a number for population and another for something else. 

Hmm, let me think. I remember from my studies thataholics often had various structures. I think mounds might be important here. Mounds are like little piles of stone, right? And I'm pretty sure they were places where people were buried. So each mound probably represents a person.

Looking at the options, I see that option C says 120 earthen mounds and 10,000 population. That sounds plausible because I've heard that Cahokia had a lot of earthen mounds. I think the number of mounds can indicate the population size. 

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I should make sure. Let me think about other options. Option G is 60 mounds and 2000. That's lower. Option E has 80 mounds and 50k. That seems a bit high. I think mounds are often associated with larger populations. Also, 10k or 12k people. I think the population was around 50,000 or 70k. Wait, let me recount. Option J is 100 walls and 1k. No, that's too low. Option F has 200 mounds and 200k, which is even higher. 

Wait, the question is about both population and the number of something. So the first part is "more than" something, and the second is the population. So, option C says 120 mounds and 10k. That fits because I think the city was large and had a significant population. Each mound probably represented about 80 people, so 120 would mean 9600 people, which isn't exactly 10k, but it's close. Alternatively, maybe each mound is around 80 people. So 120 mounds would be 9600, which is close to 10k. So option C seems the best fit.

The correct answer is C: 120 earthen mounds and 10,000. The reasoning is that the number of earthen mounds (120) in Cahokia indicates a significant population, and the population estimate aligns with this number. 

Answer: C
