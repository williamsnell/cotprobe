Question:

Assume that the masses of chicken eggs are normally distributed with a mean of 45 g and a standard deviation of 4 g. What mass of egg would be the 25th percentile of the masses of all the eggs?

Options:

A: 42.8 g
B: 42.7 g
C: 42.5 g
D: 42.0 g
E: 42.3 g
F: 42.6 g
G: 42.2 g
H: 42.1 g
I: 42.4 g
J: 41.9 g

Okay, so I have this statistics problem here about the masses of chicken eggs. The question is asking for the mass that would be the 25th percentile. Hmm, percentiles... I remember that's like the value below which 25% of the data falls. So, in this case, 25% of the eggs weigh less than this mass.

The problem says the eggs are normally distributed with a mean of 45 grams and a standard deviation of 4 grams. Right, so normal distribution means the data is symmetric around the mean, and we can use Z-scores to find percentiles. Z-scores tell us how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean.

Wait, the 25th percentile is the same as the first quartile, Q1. Right, and I think in a normal distribution, the 25th percentile is at about -0.6745 standard deviations below the mean. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again. I think I'm mixing up some Z-scores. Let me recall: the 25th percentile corresponds to a Z value where 25% of the data is below it. So, how does that translate into Z-scores?

Oh wait, I should probably remember the Z-table or remember some standard percentiles. But since I'm just thinking, I know that for a normal distribution, the lower 25% is at about -0.6745 standard deviations below the mean. So that would mean the value is mean minus 0.6745 * standard deviation.

So plugging in the numbers: mean is 45g, standard deviation is 4g. So 0.6745 *4 is approximately 2.698 grams. So subtracting that from 45 gives 45 - 2.698 = 42.302 grams. Wait, that's about 42.3 grams.

Looking at the options, E is 42.3g. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused because sometimes people use different Z-values for different percentiles. Let me make sure I got the Z value right. I remember that for the 25th percentile, the Z is about -0.6745. For example, 50th percentile is 0, 75th is +0.6745. So yes, that's correct.

So the calculation is 45 - 0.6745*(4) = 45 - 2.698 = 42.302, which rounds to 42.3g. So option E is correct.

The question asks for the mass corresponding to the 25th percentile of a normally distributed egg mass with a mean of 45 g and a standard deviation of 4 g. To find this, we use the Z-score formula for the 25th percentile, which is approximately -0.6745. 

Calculation:
Z = -0.6745  
Mass = Mean + Z * Standard Deviation  
Mass = 45 + (-0.6745 * 4)  
Mass = 45 - 2.698 = 42.302 g  

Rounded to one decimal place, the mass is 42.3 g.

Answer: E
