Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out the correct predicate logic translation for the statement: "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone." Alright, let me break this down.

First, I'll read the question again. The statement is about a relationship between people and CEOs. The key here is "some CEO," which implies there's at least one person who is a CEO. Then, this particular CEO is wealthier than everyone else. So, in logical terms, there exists a person x who is a CEO (Cx) and for all y, this x is wealthier than y (Wxy). 

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: (∀x)[Px • (∃y)(Cy • Wxy)] → This says for all x, if they're a person, there's a CEO y that they're wealthier than. That doesn't make sense because the statement is about a specific CEO, not any person.

Option B: (∃x)[Px • (∀y)(Cy • Wxy)] → This says there's a person x who is a person, a CEO, and for all y, if y is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y. Wait, but the statement is about being wealthier than everyone, not necessarily against a CEO. So this might be incorrect. It's saying x is wealthier than anyone who is a CEO, but the original statement doesn't specify whether we're comparing to a CEO or to everyone.

Option C: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] → This reads as there exists an x who is a CEO, and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. Hmm, that's interesting. So this is saying that there's a CEO who is wealthier than all people. That seems like a strong statement. But the original statement is about being wealthier than everyone, not that the CEO is the wealthiest. So maybe this is not the right approach.

Wait, but the original statement is "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone." So, in other words, there's a person (specifically a CEO) who is wealthier than every other person. So the correct expression should say, there's an x that is a CEO, and for all y, this x is wealthier than y.

Looking again, option B: (∃x)[Px • (∀y)(Cy • Wxy)] → So, x is a person, and for all y, if y is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y. But in the original statement, maybe x is just any person, not necessarily a CEO. So this might not capture the "some CEO" part correctly. Because B is saying x is a person, but in the original statement, x is a CEO. 

Option H: (∀x)[Cx • (∃y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] → This is saying that for all x, if x is a CEO, then for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. But again, the original statement is about a specific x (a CEO) being wealthier than everyone, not for all x.

Option G: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] → So, there exists an x who is a CEO, and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. Wait, same as option B, but here, x is a person. So this is saying that there's a person who is a CEO, and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. That's a bit confusing. Because x would have to be both a person and a CEO, and then for all y, if y is a person, x is wealthier than y. But that doesn't directly translate the original statement. Because the original statement is about an x who is a CEO, not that a particular x (even a person) is a CEO and wealthier than everyone.

Alternatively, maybe option B is correct. Let me think again.

The original statement is "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone." So, there exists a CEO x, and for all y, x is wealthier than y. So, in logic: ∃x (Cx ∧ ∀y (Py → Wxy)), because if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y.

Wait, but in the options, none of them directly use ∀y (Py → Wxy). Let me check.

Option B is (∃x)(Px) ∧ (∀y)(Cy ∧ Wxy). Which simplifies to ∃x (Px ∧ ∀y (Cy ∧ Wxy)). Wait, no, because "Py" would be for any y. But in the original statement, it's "every person," not "every y." So perhaps option B is not correct.

Wait, the original statement is "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone." So, it's a specific x (a CEO) that is wealthier than every person. So, the x must be a person. Because "every person" refers to all persons, and if x is a person, then it's about x being wealthier than y, where y is any person.

So, the correct predicate logic should be: There exists an x who is a person (Px), and this x is a CEO (Cx), and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y (Wxy). So, in symbols: ∃x (Px ∧ Cx ∧ ∀y (Py → Wxy)). But none of the options seem to exactly match that.

Looking back at the options, let's go through them again.

Option B: (∃x)(Px • (∀y)(Cy • Wxy)) → x must be a person, and for all y, if y is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y. So, this is saying that there's a person x, and for all y (which are assumed to be people), if y is a CEO, then Wxy. That seems to suggest that x is wealthier than all CEOS, which is not what the original statement says. The original says x is a CEO and wealthier than everyone.

Option H: (∀x)[Cx • (∃y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] → For all x, if x is a CEO, then for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. So, this is saying that every CEO is wealthier than everyone. But the original statement is about "some" CEOs, not "all."

Option G: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py ⊃ Wxy)] → So, there exists an x who is a CEO, and for all y (whether they are people or not), x is wealthier than y. But this seems like saying the CEО is the absolute wealthiest, which is not what we need.

Option E: (∃x)[Px ⊃ (∀y)(Cy ⊃ Wxy)] → This says, if x is a person, then for all y, if y is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y. Again, this is about x being a person, and being wealthier than all CEOS, which isn't the same as someone being a CEO and wealthier than everyone.

Option F: (∃x)[Cx ⊃ (∀y)(Py • Wxy)] → This is saying, if x is a CEO, then for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. So, x being a CEO implies they're wealthier than everyone. But this is a one-way implication. It doesn't necessarily mean there exists a x who is a CEO and wealthier than everyone. Because x could be a person who is a CEO, but not wealthier than everyone. So this seems too strong.

Option J: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy)] → This is saying there's a person x who is a CEO, and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. So, x is both a CEO and wealthier than everyone. That's exactly what the original statement is saying. So this seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the options. Let me double-check.

The original statement: Some CEO is wealthier than everyone. So, there exists an x who is a CEO (so Cx) and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y (Wxy). So in symbols: ∃x (Cx ∧ ∀y (Py → Wxy)).

Looking for an option that represents this.

Option J: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy)] → So, x is a CEO (Cx) and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y (Wxy). So, yes, this is exactly what we need. So option J is correct.

Wait, but let me check other options.

Option A: ∀x[Px • (∃y)Cy • Wxy] → For all x, if x is person and there exists a y who is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y. That seems to suggest that all persons have a CEO who is wealthier than them, which is not the same as some CE owns more than everyone.

Option B: ∃x (Px) ∧ ∀y (Cy → Wxy) → So, x is a person, and for all y, if y is a CEO, then x is wealthier than y. So, x is wealthier than all CEOS, but not necessarily that x is a CEO and wealthier than everyone. So this might not capture the original statement.

Option G: ∃x (Cx) ∧ ∀y (Py → Wxy) → So, x is a CEO, and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. So, x is a CEO who is wealthier than everyone. But the original statement doesn't require that x is a CEO; it's just that some CE exists. So, G is making a stronger claim than what's intended.

Wait, but the original statement says "some CEO is wealthier than everyone." So, it's asserting existence of at least one CEO who is wealthier than everyone. So, in logic, that's ∃x (Cx) and for all y, if y is a person, then Wxy.

So, looking for an option that says there's a x, who is a CEO (Cx), and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y (Wxy).

Looking again at the options, option J is (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy)].

So this translates to: There exists an x who is a CEO (Cx) and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y (Py and Wxy). So, this is correct.

Wait, but let me check another option, option J. Yes, that's right.

So the correct answer should be option J.
</think>

The correct translation is option J: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy)].

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the statement structure**: The statement is "Some CEO is wealthier than everyone." This involves existence of a specific entity (CEO) and a universal condition (wealthier than everyone).

2. **Translate each part**:
   - "Some CEO" translates to ∃x (Cx).
   - "Wealthier than everyone" translates to ∀y (Py → Wxy), meaning for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y.

3. **Combine the parts**: The existential quantifier applies to x, who is a CEO, and for all y, if y is a person, then x is wealthier than y. This is captured in option J: (∃x)[Cx • (∀y)(Py • Wxy)].

4. **Evaluate other options**:
   - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H: These either incorrectly use universal quantifiers, mix person and CEO roles, or make stronger claims that don't align with the original statement.

Thus, option J correctly captures the intended meaning.
