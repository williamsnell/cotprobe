Question:

A homeowner entered into a written contract with a house painter to have his house painted for $10,000. The contract stated in part: "It is agreed that the house painter will paint the house using off-white latex paint, and will finish the job within 30 days from the execution of this agreement. If the homeowner finds the completed job to be satisfactory, he will pay the house painter $10,000 within one week after the job is completed. "Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the homeowner's contractual obligation to pay the house painter $10,000?

Options:

A: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition subsequent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.
B: The performances of the homeowner and the house painter were, in essence, concurrent conditions.
C: The performances of the homeowner and the house painter were, in essence, independent conditions.
D: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be a concurrent condition to the house painter's duty of performance.
E: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.
F: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.
G: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
H: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job is an implied condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
I: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job would be an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
J: The homeowner's satisfaction with the job is an implied condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this contract question. Let me read it carefully again. So, the homeowner entered into a contract with a house painter. The contract says the painter will paint the house using off-white latex paint, and finish within 30 days. If the job is satisfactory, the homeowner pays $10,000 within one week after. The question is about the homeowner's obligation to pay $10,000.

Hmm, I remember from my contracts class that when it comes to express and implied conditions, express conditions are clear obligations, while implied are ones that aren't explicitly stated. Also, precedence and consequence refer to when one condition comes before another.

Looking at the options, the key is to identify whether $10,000 payment is an express condition or implied, and whether it's a prior or concurrent condition to the painter's performance.

So, the contract says the painter will paint the house with specific paint and finish within 30 days. That's an express condition because it's clearly stated. Then, if the job is satisfactory, the payment is done within one week. So, the payment is a consequence of the painter's performance.

Wait, but the question is about the payment obligation of the homeowner. So, the payment is a consequence, which is a consequence condition. Additionally, the payment is a condition precedent because it's a condition that comes before the painter's performance is expected to be done. Or is it concurrent?

Wait, let me think. In contract law, the express condition is what is written in the contract. The consequence is what is implied. But here, the payment is done upfront, so it's a subsequent condition. So, the $10,000 is a consequence condition that comes after the painter's performance is expected to be completed. So, that's a subsequent condition, but is it a condition precedent?

Wait, the options are about whether the $10,000 is a condition precedent or concurrent. Let me re-examine the options.

Option A: Express condition subsequent to payment. So, the painter's performance is an express condition that comes after the payment. But wait, the payment is a condition precedent because it's before the painter is expected to finish. So, maybe Option A is incorrect because the payment is a subsequent condition.

Wait, no. Let me look again at the options.

Option E: The house painter's performance is an express condition precedent to the homeowner's payment. So, the painter's performance is an express condition that happened before the payment, which is a condition precedent. That makes sense.

Wait, but the payment is after the painter's performance. So, the payment is a condition that comes after the performance, meaning it's a subsequent condition. Alternatively, in some cases, the payment is a condition precedent because it's done before the painter's performance is expected.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

Express conditions are things written in the contract, which are obligations the painter must perform. So, the painter must paint the house with specific paint and finish within 30 days. That's an express condition.

Implied conditions are things that are not explicitly stated but are inferred from the contract. For example, if the painter finishes in 30 days, the payment comes after. So, the payment is a consequence condition.

The payment is a condition precedent because it's a condition that must be satisfied before the painter is expected to do their performance. So, the payment is done before the painter starts, and the painter is expected to finish. So, the $10,000 is a condition precedent.

Wait, so the correct statement would be that the $10,000 is a condition precedent to the painter's duty of performance. So, that would be option G or H.

Looking at the options again:

Options:

E: Precedent to payment. So, payment is a condition precedent.

H: Precedent to payment.

Wait, no: Option E says the painter's performance is an express condition precedent to the payment. That's the painter's condition is a condition that comes before the payment, which is correct.

Similarly, option H says the payment is an express condition precedent to the painter's performance. So, the payment is before the performance is done.

So, which is correct? The payment is done before the painter's performance, so the payment is a condition precedent to the painter's performance. So, H says payment is an express condition precedent to performance. That would be correct.

Wait, but wait, in contract law, the express condition is the obligation (performance) made in the contract, and the implied condition is the consequence (payment). So, the payment is a subsequent condition because it's after the painter's performance is done.

But the question is about the homeowner's obligation to pay $10,000. So, the payment is a condition precedent because it's a prior condition. So, the payment is a condition precedent to the painter's performance.

Therefore, the correct option would be H: The payment is an express condition precedent to the painter's performance.

Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

E: Precedent to payment.

H: Express condition precedent to performance.

So, the payment is a condition precedent, but is it express or implied?

Hmm. The payment is a condition precedent because it's a condition that must be satisfied before the painter is expected to perform. So, in this case, the payment is an implied condition precedent?

Wait, no. The payment is an express condition? Or is it implied?

Wait, in a written contract, if the payment is not written, it's an implied condition. But in this case, the contract does state the payment is to be made within a week. So, the payment is an express condition because it's written.

So, the payment is an express condition precedent to the painter's performance.

So, that would be option H: The payment is an express condition precedent to the painter's performance.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E says "precedent to the payment." Oh, no, wait. Option E says the painter's performance is a condition precedent to the payment. So, the performance is done first.

Wait, but the payment is $10,000; the painter must paint first. So, the painter's performance is an express condition, and the payment is an implied condition that comes after.

So, the payment is a condition that comes after the performance, hence a subsequent condition. So, it's an implied condition.

But the payment is a condition precedent because it's a condition that must be met before the performance is performed. So, the payment is a condition precedent, not an express condition.

Wait, that might be the confusion here. Let me think again.

Express conditions are what's written in the contract, which must be performed. So, the painter's performance is an express condition that must occur before the payment is made.

The payment is a subsequent condition because it's done after the painter's performance is done. So, the payment is a consequence condition, which is an implied condition.

So, in that case, the payment is a condition precedent because it's a condition that must be met before the painter's performance is expected to be done. Thus, the payment is a condition precedent.

So, the payment is a condition precedent, but is it expressed or implied?

Wait, the payment is an implied condition because it's not written in the contract. So, the payment is an implied condition precedent.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let's look at the options again.

Option G: Payment is implied condition precedent to painter's performance.

Option H: Payment is express condition precedent to performance.

So, the payment is an implied condition. But in the contract, it's not written, so it's implied.

But the payment is a condition precedent because it's a condition that must be satisfied before the painter's performance is done. So, the payment is a condition precedent regardless of whether it's expressed or implied.

Wait, but in this case, the payment is an implied condition because it's not written. So, the implication is that the payment is an implied condition precedent. But since the payment is an implied condition, its position is a condition precedent.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on whether the payment is an express condition or an implied condition.

If the payment is an implied condition, it would be an implied condition precedent.

So, looking for an option that says the payment is an implied condition precedent.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Implied condition subsequent.

Option G: Implied condition precedent.

Option H: Express condition precedent.

Wait, I'm not sure, but let me see.

The options are:

E: Precedent to payment.

H: Express condition precedent to performance.

Wait, the payment is a condition precedent, which would be option E: The painter's performance is an express condition precedent to the payment. No, that's not correct because the payment comes after the performance, so the payment is a condition precedent.

Wait, no. Option E says "precedent to the payment." So, the payment is a condition precedent to the painter's performance. That's correct.

Option H says "payment is an express condition precedent to the painter's performance." That's correct as well, but the payment is an implied condition.

Wait, but the payment is an implied condition, not an express one. So, the payment is not an express condition, but it is a condition precedent because it must be satisfied before the painter's performance is done.

So, the correct statement is that the payment is a condition precedent to the painter's performance, but whether it's an express or implied condition.

Wait, but the payment is an implied condition because it's not written in the contract. So, the payment is an implied condition precedent.

Looking at the options, the correct option is either G or H.

So, the correct answer is about whether the payment is an express condition or an implied condition.

Wait, the payment is an implied condition because it's not written. So, the payment is a condition precedent, but since it's implied, it's an implied condition precedent.

But the options don't have an option that says that. Let me recheck the options:

Option G: Payment is an implied condition precedent to painter's performance.

Option H: Payment is an express condition precedent to performance.

So, the payment is an implied condition because it's not written. So, Option G says it's an implied condition precedent.

So, the correct answer would be H or G?

Wait, the payment is a condition precedent to the painter's performance. It's an implied condition because it's not written. So, the correct statement is that the payment is an implied condition precedent.

So, the correct option is G: Payment is an implied condition precedent to the painter's performance.

But wait, the payment is a condition precedent regardless. So, the correct answer is that the payment is a condition precedent. So, the answer is either E or G.

Wait, option E says the painter's performance is an express condition precedent to the payment. So, the payment comes after the performance, which is correct.

So, the payment is a condition precedent to the painter's performance.

But the payment is an implied condition because it's not written. So, the payment is an implied condition precedent.

Hmm. So, the payment is a condition precedent, but whether it's express or implied.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option E: The painter's performance is an express condition precedent to the payment.

But no, because the payment is after the performance. So, the payment is a condition precedent to the painter's performance.

Wait, so the correct answer would be option E is incorrect because it says the payment is a condition precedent to the painter's performance, which is correct. But the payment is an implied condition, so the correct way is to say that the payment is an implied condition precedent.

But looking at the options, option G says the payment is an implied condition precedent. So, that's correct.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

The question is about whether the payment is an express condition or an implied condition, and whether it's a condition precedent or a condition subsequent.

In contract law, when a contract includes a condition that isn't written, it's an implied condition. So, the payment is an implied condition.

The payment is a condition precedent because it must be satisfied before the painter's performance is done.

So, the correct statement is that the payment is an implied condition precedent to the painter's performance.

Looking at the options, option G is "Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an implied condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance." So, option G says that.

So, the correct answer is G.
</think>

The correct answer is **G: Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an implied condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.**

### Explanation:
1. **Express Conditions**: These are clear obligations specified in the contract, such as painting the house with off-white latex paint and finishing within 30 days. This is an **express condition** as it is explicitly stated in the contract.

2. **Implied Conditions**: These are obligations inferred from the contract but not explicitly stated. In this case, the payment of $10,000 is implied to be due after the painter's performance is expected to be completed. This is a **subsequent condition** because it must be met after the painter's work is expected.

3. **Condition Precedent**: This means the payment is a condition that must be satisfied before the painter's performance is expected to be done. Since the payment is not written in the contract, it is an **implied condition precedent**.

4. **Conclusion**: The homeowner's obligation to pay $10,000 is an implied condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.
