Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about work groups and the type of relationship between workers and line managers. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question asks how to describe a work group where workers have demarcated tasks and line managers are distant. The options given are A to I, with some options like B, D, G, etc. I remember from my studies that certain work group structures have specific names, like collaborative or cohesive groups.

Hmm, let's think about what each term means. A collaborative group is when people work together towards a common goal, maybe they share resources or knowledge. So that fits a work group where tasks are demarcated because people have clear roles, and line managers are distantâ€”probably not in a strict authority hierarchy.

Another term I recall is cohesive. Cohesive groups are strong, working together, maybe in a team where everyone is committed to achieving a common purpose. That seems to fit the scenario because the workers are grouped with tasks, and the line manager is not directly involved, just someone outside the group.

Wait, what about integrated groups? Integrated groups might involve collaboration but perhaps less clearly, and maybe more focused on communication. I'm not sure if that's the best fit here.

Interdependent groups would imply that each person's actions depend on others, which doesn't quite match the scenario. They have demarcated tasks, so there's more of a division of labor.

Synergistic groups work together to achieve a mutual benefit, which might be relevant, but I'm not sure if that's the exact term.

Dependent groups might have one person's success affecting others, which isn't the case here.

Hierarchical is more about a strict command-and-control structure, which doesn't fit because line managers are distant.

Independent groups are those where individuals don't have to work together, which doesn't make sense here.

So the options that seem relevant are B (co-dependent?) Wait, no, co-dependent isn't a term I remember. Let me check again. Maybe I got B wrong. Wait, the options are A to I. Let me list the options again.

Options are:
A: Interdependent
B: Co-dependent
C: Cohesive
D: Integrated
E: Synergistic
F: Independent
G: Collaborative
H: Hierarchical
I: Dependent

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Cohesive is a term I remember. So in a work group where tasks are demarcated and line managers are distant, it's more about collaboration. So the correct term would be Cohesive, which is option C.

Wait, wait, but what's the exact term? I thought of Collaborative and Cohesive. Collaborative groups are about working together towards a common goal, but sometimes they might involve hierarchy. Hmm, but in this case, the line manager is distant, which suggests that the group is more about collaboration without strict hierarchy.

Alternatively, maybe the term is "cohesive," which implies that the group is strong and together they work. So the correct answer should be C: Cohesive.

The correct answer is C: Cohesive. This term describes a work group where tasks are clearly demarcated, and the line manager is distant, indicating a strong, collaborative structure without strict hierarchy. 

Answer: C
