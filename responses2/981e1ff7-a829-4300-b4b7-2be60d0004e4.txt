Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about world hunger and poverty. I need to figure out which principle Arthur points out that Singer ignores. The options are A to J, each mentioning a different principle. I'm a bit rusty on the principles, but I'll try to recall them.

First, the question is about world hunger and poverty. So the topic is about issues related to those problems. The options are all different principles. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Sacrifice and Reward. I remember that principle being about giving up something valuable to achieve a goal. Like, in economics, a trade-off. But does that relate to hunger or poverty? Maybe in terms of rewarding development, but not directly about the issue itself.

Option B: Right and the Good. This sounds like the rights and the good principle. So, people should act according to their rights and the good, which would prevent harm. But how does that connect to hunger or poverty? It's more about ensuring that people take actions that are right and beneficial, but not sure if it's about ignoring a particular issue.

Option C: Contribution and Entitlement. Contribution is about giving, and entitlement is rights. So this could relate to ensuring that people have the right to help and that they contribute. I'm not sure if this is about ignoring a principle but more about ensuring equality or rights.

Option D: Equality and Harm. This sounds like a principle where people should be treated equally and not harm others. But in the context of hunger and poverty, equality might be a problem because if everyone is treated equally, resources might not be enough. So maybe this is about ignoring a principle where equality is not the solution but something else.

Option E: Rights and Desires. Rights are what you're allowed to do, and desires are what you want. So if rights are violated, you have a desire to help, but is that about ignoring a principle? Not sure.

Option F: Need and Capacity. Need is the problem (like hunger), and capacity is about the ability to help. This seems relevant because hunger is a need and people have certain capacities to help. So perhaps this is about a principle that relates to the issue.

Option G: Duty and Benefit. Duty is a moral obligation, and benefit is the outcome. So if someone has a duty to help, and that duty provides a benefit, does this ignore another principle? Or maybe it's about ensuring that helping is a duty, but I'm not sure.

Option H: Obligation and Privilege. Obligation is a duty, privilege is something you're granted. Maybe if someone has an obligation to help, but privilege is something you get. I'm not sure how this connects to ignoring a principle.

Option I: Obligation and privilege. Wait, that's the same as H, just rephrased. So no, that's not the same.

Option J: Justice and Fairness. This is about treating everyone equally and with fairness. In terms of hunger, fairness might mean equal access to resources, but I'm not sure if justice is the principle that's being ignored.

Wait, the question is about Arthur pointing out that Singer ignores a principle. So I need to find which principle applies to hunger and poverty but is not mentioned in Singer's principles.

Another angle: think about the principles as discussed in the context of development or poverty alleviation. I remember that in some frameworks, the principles are about responsibility, equality, need, contribution, etc. For example, the principles of development often include equality, need, and responsibility.

Wait, the question is about hunger and poverty. So perhaps the principles of need and capacity (F) are more relevant. Because hunger is a need, and the ability to contribute is part of capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps the principles of right and the good (B) are about ensuring that everyone has the right to help, so it's about preventing harm, but maybe it's not the one being ignored.

Wait, another approach: think about the principles in the context of the issue. For example, in the context of hunger, the key principles might be equality and the need for justice. Or perhaps the principles of contribution and entitlement (C), which deal with how resources are used.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option F says 'the principles of need and capacity.' So in the context of hunger, need is the problem ( hunger is a need), and capacity is the ability to contribute. So this could be a principle that is relevant in this context. So if someone is ignoring F, that would mean that Singer is not considering that people have the capacity to help, or that helping is a need.

Wait, but the question is about what Arthur points out that Singer ignores. So perhaps the principle that Arthur is pointing out is one that's more of a moral or ethical principle, not just a practical one.

Alternatively, perhaps the principles of need and capacity (F) are more about the actual problem than the solution. So if Singer is using the principle of right and the good, maybe that's about ensuring that people have the right to help and that their actions are good, which implies that harm isn't the issue.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: 'the principles of need and capacity.' Because when talking about hunger and poverty, the need is the problem (people are hungry, they need to get food), and capacity is about whether they have the ability to help. So if Singer is focusing on the need (like, 'help is a right') and the good (that helping is good), he's saying that helping is a right and that it's good. So he's not addressing the capacity aspect (how much someone can contribute), which would be the principle of need and capacity. So if Singer ignores that (like, he's focusing on the rightness and good of help, but not the capacity), then F would be the answer.

So the options are:

F: the principles of need and capacity.

So the answer should be F.

The question focuses on understanding which principle Arthur points out that Singer ignores, particularly in the context of world hunger and poverty. The analysis of each option reveals the following:

- **A: Sacrifice and Reward:** Relates to trade-offs, not directly to hunger or poverty.
- **B: Right and the Good:** Involves moral obligations to aid, not the issue itself.
- **C: Contribution and Entitlement:** Ensures rights and contributions, relevant but not the focus.
- **D: Equality and Harm:** Seeks fairness to prevent harm, not the specific issue.
- **E: Rights and Desires:** Focuses on moral obligations, not the need for help.
- **F: The principles of need and capacity:** Addresses the need for food and the capacity of individuals to contribute, directly linking to hunger and poverty.
- **G: Duty and Benefit:** Involves moral obligations, not the issue.
- **H, I, J:** Discuss other principles but not relevant to the issue.

The correct answer is **F: the principles of need and capacity**, as it directly relates to the concern for hunger and poverty, focusing on the need for food and the capacity of individuals to contribute. This principle is highlighted by the question as the one Arthur points out that Singer ignores.

Answer: F
