Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about two rocks, one heavy and one light, in free fall with zero air resistance. The question says they have the same acceleration. The options are A through J.

Hmm, the first thing I remember is that acceleration in free fall is due to gravity. But wait, the question says the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration because of something. So, I need to figure out what that something is.

Let me think about the physics here. In a vacuum, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass. So, if there's no air resistance, both rocks should have the same acceleration, which is g (approximately 9.8 m/sÂ²). So, the fact that the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration is because there's no air resistance affecting it, right?

Looking at the options, option E says "force due to gravity is zero in free fall." Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because in free fall, the only force acting on them is gravity. So the net force on each rock should be mg, not zero. So E is incorrect.

Option A says air resistance is always zero in free fall. Well, that's true in a vacuum, but the question says zero air resistance. So in free fall, they don't have air resistance, so A is correct. But the question is why the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration because of that.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration because the..." So the premise is that they have the same acceleration because of something, and the reason given is that something. 

Wait, the situation is that the rocks are in free fall, which means no air resistance. So the only force is gravity. So both rocks have the same acceleration because they have the same mass times gravity, but since they're both under same gravity, their accelerations are same.

The fact that the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration is because there's no air resistance. So, the correct reasoning is that the force from gravity is the same on each because mass times g is the same. So, the reason is because the force due to gravity is the same.

Looking at the options, option C says "force due to gravity is the same on each." So that's the correct statement. Option E is about gravitational force being zero, which isn't correct because gravity is still present.

Wait, but another angle: in free fall, the acceleration is same because both have same g. So the reason the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration is because of the same gravitational force. So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, the question is what is the reason why the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration. The reasoning is that the force due to gravity is the same on each. So the answer should be C.

Other options: Option E is wrong because free fall implies no air resistance, not zero force. So E is incorrect. Option A is talking about air resistance being zero, which is correct, but the question is why does the heavy rock not have a greater acceleration because of that. So the correct answer is C.

The question asks why the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration in free fall with zero air resistance because of a particular reason. In free fall, both rocks experience the same acceleration due to gravity, which is why they have the same acceleration. The correct reasoning is that the force due to gravity is the same on each rock. 

Option A is incorrect because air resistance is not zero in free fall; it is zero in the absence of air resistance. Option E incorrectly states that the force due to gravity is zero, which is not true. The correct answer is C.
