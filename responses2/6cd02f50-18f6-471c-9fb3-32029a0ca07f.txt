Okay, so I have this question about why our eyes are involved in manual acts like dressing or tying knots when we're closed. Hmm. I remember that the eyes are primarily responsible for vision, right? But then why can we perform some manual actions even when we're not seeing?

Wait, maybe it's about how the eye interacts with other parts of the body. I think when you look at something, your eyes send signals to your brain, which then tells you where it is. But if you can't see, how does that relate to manual actions? Oh, right, maybe it's something about the visual feedback.

Wait no, that's not it. I remember something about reflexes and the nervous system. When the eyes are closed, you can still move your body because the brain sends signals to the muscles. But maybe it's about the visual feedback during movement. Oh, like when you're trying to tie a knot, you might need to look around, but without seeing, you can still perform the act because the eye provides some kind of visual cue.

Wait, another angle: maybe it's about the muscles that respond to visual cues. Like, when you look around, you're not seeing the entire scene, but you can still navigate. Or perhaps it's about the oculomotor muscles. Oh, wait! The oculomotor muscles control eye movement. So when you're looking around to tie a knot, you need to direct your gaze, and those muscles might compensate for the lack of visual information somehow.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The question is about manual acts when eyes are closed. So if the eyes aren't closed, you can't see, but you can still move. So when you have the eyes closed, you can't see, but your oculomotor muscles can still control eye movements, allowing you to perform actions like dressing or tying knots. Because the muscles are part of the nervous system that responds to visual signals through other means, like through the photoreceptors or something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about why we can perform manual acts when eyes are closed. So the reason must be about the oculomotor system. When you close your eyes, you can't see, but you can still move your head, etc., since the oculomotor muscles control eye movements. So the oculomotor muscles are involved in this, which are part of the nervous system, and they're controlled by the photoreceptors.

Wait, but the options include various types of receptors. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A to J, each representing different types of receptors. The question is about why we can perform such acts even when closed eyes. So the answer is probably about the oculomotor systems, but which specific receptors are involved.

Wait, the oculomotor system is controlled by the photoreceptors (like the retina) and the photoreceptors send signals through the optic nerve to the brain, which then controls the muscles in the eyes. Or wait, maybe it's the eye's own muscles that can move even without visual input, which are the oculomotor muscles. Those muscles are controlled by the photoreceptors, but what part of the nervous system is it?

Wait, the oculomotor system is part of the central nervous system. The photoreceptors in the retina provide the visual signals, which are then sent to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries these signals to the brain, which then sends signals to the oculum muscles, which control the eye's movement. So when the eyes are closed, you can't see, but the oculomotor muscles can still control eye movements to perform actions. But how does this relate to the question?

Wait, the question is about the last character of the answer being the letter chosen. The options are all types of receptors. So the correct answer is about the oculomotor system, which is controlled by the photoreceptors. So the options are about photoreceptors.

Wait, but the options don't have an option for photoreceptors. Hmm. Let me check the list again.

Options are:
A: Gustatory receptors
B: Photoreceptors
C: Auditory receptors
D: Proprioceptors
E: Thermoreceptors
F: Nociceptors
G: Mechanoreceptors
H: Chemoreceptors
I: Olfactory receptors
J: Baroreceptors

So the question is, which receptor type is responsible for the oculomotor system?

The oculomotor system is part of the photoreceptors. Or more precisely, the photoreceptors (retina) provide the necessary signals, which are sent through the optic nerve to the brain, which then sends signals to the oculomotor muscles, which are controlled by the photoreceptors.

Wait, but the oculomotor system's function is that it uses the photoreceptors to control eye movements. So the answer would be B: Photoreceptors.

But wait, the question is about manual acts when eyes are closed. So without seeing, but with oculomotor muscles, you can still perform actions.

Wait, but the question is asking why we can do that. So the answer is that the oculomotor system is controlled by photoreceptors. So the correct option is B.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: when the eyes are closed, you cannot see, but the oculomotor system can still function because the eye muscles are controlled by the photoreceptors. So the oculomotor system is controlled by photoreceptors, so the answer is B.

The question asks why we can perform manual acts, such as dressing or tying knots, when our eyes are closed. The key lies in understanding the role of the oculomotor system, which is controlled by photoreceptors in the retina. Without vision, the eye muscles (culiomotor system) can still function to perform these actions by compensating with the oculomotor system, which relies on photoreceptor signals to guide eye movements. 

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is that photoreceptors are responsible for this function, as they provide the necessary visual signals to control the oculomotor system when the eyes are closed. 

Answer: B
