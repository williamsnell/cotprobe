Question:

Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?

Options:

A: 608
B: 960
C: 2321
D: 211
E: 500
F: 512
G: 11
H: 1000
I: 2048
J: 150

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So Anton has two species of ants, A and B. They look the same, but they multiply every day. Species A doubles each day, and Species B triples each day. On Day 0, there are 30 ants total. On Day 5, the count is 3281 ants. I need to find out how many are Species A on Day 5.

Hmm, let's break this down. Let's denote the number of Species A ants on Day 0 as 'a' and Species B as 'b'. So, on Day 0, a + b = 30.

Now, each day, Species A's count doubles. So on Day 1, it's 2a, Day 2 it's 4a (which is 2^2 a), and so on. Similarly, Species B triples each day. So on Day 1, it's 3b, Day 2 it's 9b (3^2 b), and so forth.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The problem says Species A has twice as many each day. So each day, the count is multiplied by 2. Similarly, Species B is multiplied by 3 each day. So from Day 0 to Day 5, each species' count increases by a factor each day.

So, on Day 5, the number of Species A ants is a * (2^5), and Species B is b * (3^5).

So total ants on Day 5: a*(2^5) + b*(3^5) = 3281.

But wait, on Day 0, a + b = 30. So I have two equations:

1. a + b = 30
2. 32a + 243b = 3281 (since 2^5 is 32 and 3^5 is 243)

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me correct that. 2 to the 5th power is 32, yes. 3^5 is 3*3=9, then 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243. So yes, 243.

So now I have:

Equation 1: a + b = 30
Equation 2: 32a + 243b = 3281

I can solve these two equations. Let's use substitution. From equation 1, a = 30 - b.

Substituting into equation 2:

32*(30 - b) + 243b = 3281

Let's compute 32*30: 32*30 is 960, and 32*(-b) is -32b.

So equation becomes: 960 -32b +243b = 3281

Combine like terms: (-32b +243b) is 211b.

So 960 + 211b = 3281

Subtract 960 from both sides: 211b = 3281 - 960 = 2321

So b = 2321 / 211. Let me calculate that.

211 * 11 is 2321. Because 211*10=2110, plus 211 is 2321. So b=11.

Then a = 30 -11 =19.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, 211 * 11 is 2321. So 2321 /211 =11. So b=11.

So on Day 5, Species A is a*32 =19 *32.

Wait, 19 *32: 20*32 is 640, minus 1*32 is 32. So 640-32=608. So Species A is 608.

Looking at the options, option A is 608. So the answer would be A.

The number of Species A ants on Day 5 is 608.
