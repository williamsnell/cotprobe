Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The problem states that there's a long, straight wire with a fixed negative charge. The linear charge density is given as 3.6 nC/m. The wire is enclosed by a coaxial, thin-walled nonconducting cylindrical shell. The shell has a positive charge on its outer surface with surface charge density sigma. The goal is to find sigma such that the net external electric field is zero.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with electric fields around charges, Gauss's Law is really useful. Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by epsilon zero. So, phi = Q_enc / epsilon_0.

The setup here is about two concentric cylindrical shells. The inner cylinder is a wire with negative charge, and the outer one is a nonconducting shell with positive charge. The shell is conducting, but wait, no, it says nonconducting. Oh wait, no, the shell is nonconducting, so it's just a regular cylinder with charge. But wait, the question says it's coaxial and thin-walled, so it's a cylindrical shell, maybe a non-conducting one? Oh wait, wait, the shell is nonconducting, so it doesn't have free charges. Wait, no, wait. The shell is nonconducting, but it's enclosing the wire. So the conducting part would be the wire, which has negative charge. Wait, no, the shell is nonconducting. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Wait, the setup is a cylindrical shell: the wire is inside, then the shell surrounds it. The shell is nonconducting. So the wire is a conductor with negative charge, and the shell is a non-conducting cylinder with positive charge on its outer surface. I think that part is a bit tricky.

Wait, but the shell's outer surface is positively charged. So the shell's charge is a result of some charges being induced on it. But wait, since the shell is nonconducting, how is it charged? Oh, wait, the shell itself has a positive surface charge. So the shell must have induced charges based on the wire's charge.

Wait, but the wire is fixed, so the electric field in the region outside the wire (but inside the shell) must be considered. The shell's charge would create an electric field outside itself, but the problem states that the net external electric field is zero. So, the shell's charge must cancel the electric field produced by the wire in the region outside the shell.

Wait, but wait a second. The shell is nonconducting. Oh, but wait, no, the shell is a conductor. Wait, no, the problem said the shell is nonconducting. So the shell is an insulator. Hmm. Wait, but wait, the shell's charge is on its outer surface. Oh, but the shell is nonconducting, so it doesn't have free charges. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the shell is nonconducting, but it's a conductor? No, wait, the shell is nonconducting, so it's an insulator. So, the shell's charge is on its own outer surface, but it's an insulator, so it doesn't allow free charges to flow. So, what's the charge distribution on the shell?

Wait, let's think about the setup again. The wire is a conductor with negative charge. It's enclosed by a nonconducting shell. The shell has a positive surface charge on its outside. So, the shell's charge must be induced by the wire's charge.

Wait, but the shell is nonconducting, so it's an insulator. So, the electric field inside the shell (the region between the wire and the shell) is due to the wire and the shell's charge. But wait, since the shell is nonconducting, any excess charge would remain on the outer surface. But wait, the wire's charge is on the inner surface of the shell. Because the inner surface of a conductor would have opposite charges to the external ones, but wait, no. If the wire is a conductor, its free charges would be on its surface. So, the shell is nonconducting, so it's an insulator. Therefore, the wire is a conductor with negative charge. The shell is nonconducting; it's a cylinder with a positive surface charge on its outer surface.

Wait, but then the shell is nonconducting, so it doesn't have free charges. So, the only charges are the wire's charge (on the inner surface) and the shell's charge (on its own outer surface). The inner surface of the shell has negative charge from the wire. The shell's outer surface has positive charge.

But wait, the outer surface of the shell has positive charge, which would induce a negative charge on the inner surface of the shell because it's a conductor. Wait, no, no because the shell is nonconducting. Wait, that's only if it's a conductor. Wait, if the shell is a conductor, then it would have induced charges, but since it's nonconducting, the charge stays on the surface. So, let me clarify.

In a conductor, the electric field inside the conducting material is zero. The charges rearrange so that the inner surface of the conductor has the negative of the external charge, and the outer surface has the same as the external charge. But in this case, the shell is nonconducting, so the charges can't move. So the inner surface of the shell would have the same charge as the wire. And the outer surface of the shell would have a charge that doesn't have an induced effect because it's a non-conductor.

Wait, no. Because the shell is nonconducting, it's just a cylinder with a certain charge on its outer surface. The wire's charge is on the inner surface of the shell. Because it's a conductor, the inner surface would have the negative charge, but wait, no, because the wire is a conductor, the inner surface would have the negative charge, and the outer surface would have the positive. But wait, we're in the case where the shell is nonconducting, so that's not possible. So, perhaps the shell is a conductor again. Oh, wait, the question says the shell is nonconducting, so that's a no-go.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again.

The setup: the wire is fixed with negative charge. The wire is a conductor, so it must have charge on its surface. The wire is enclosed by a nonconducting shell. The shell has a positive surface charge on its outer surface. So, the shell is nonconducting, meaning it doesn't allow free charges to move. So, the inner surface of the shell must have a charge that cancels the electric field due to the wire inside the shell.

Wait, but the wire is a conductor, so the inner surface of the shell would have negative charge to cancel the field from the wire inside the shell. Wait, no. Wait, the shell is nonconducting. So, the electric field inside the shell is due to the wire and the shell's own charge. But the shell's own charge is on the outer surface, so the field inside the shell (the region outside the wire and inside the shell) is due to the wire's charge and the shell's charge.

Wait, but the shell's charge is on the outer surface. So, the region outside the wire but inside the shell would have an electric field due to both the wire and the shell's charge. But the problem states that the net external electric field is zero. So, that means the electric field due to the shell and the wire must cancel out in that region.

Wait, but wait, the shell is nonconducting. So, the electric field inside the shell (the region between the wire and the shell) is due to both the wire and the shell's charge. But the shell's charge is on its outer surface. So, the electric field outside the shell (the region outside the shell) would be the sum of the electric fields from the wire and the shell's charge.

Wait, but the problem says the net external electric field is zero. So, the electric field outside the shell (assuming that's the region we're considering) is zero. So, the sum of the fields due to the wire and the shell's charge must be zero.

But wait, the shell's charge is on its outer surface. So, the electric field outside the shell (r > R_shell) is due to the wire and the shell's charge. But the shell's charge is on its outer surface, so the field outside the shell (r > R_shell) would only be due to the shell's charge, right? Because the wire's charge is inside the shell. Wait, but the shell is nonconducting, so the electric field inside the conductor (if it were conducting) would be zero, but since it's nonconducting, that doesn't apply. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Gauss's Law for the shell's outer surface. The electric field outside the shell (r > R_shell) is determined by the charge on the shell. The shell's charge is sigma * 2π R_shell * L, where L is the length of the cylinder, but since L is not given, perhaps it cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, let's think about the Gaussian surface outside the shell. The electric field E is zero because the net external field is zero. So, E = Q_enc / (4π epsilon_0 r^2) = 0. Which implies that Q_enc must be zero. Wait, but that can't be correct because the shell has a positive charge, so the net charge inside a Gaussian surface outside the shell would be the charge enclosed by the wire plus the shell's charge.

Wait, the problem says that the shell is to have a positive surface charge sigma on its outside surface. So, the total charge on the shell is sigma * (2π R_shell L). But in the region outside the shell (r > R_shell), the electric field is zero. So, the sum of the electric fields from the wire and the shell must be zero.

Wait, but the shell's charge is on its outer surface, and the region outside the shell is empty? No, wait, no. The shell is a conductor or non-conductor? Wait, the shell is non-conducting, so no free charges can be induced. So, the shell's charge is on the surface, and in the region outside the shell (r > R_shell), the electric field is only due to the shell's charge. But the problem states that the net external field (at r > R_shell) is zero. So, the shell's charge must be such that its field is zero.

Wait, but that's impossible unless the shell has zero charge. But that's not the case. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Let me re-examine the problem:

The wire is fixed with negative charge. The shell is nonconducting, thin-walled, coaxial, surrounding the wire. The shell's outer surface has positive charge sigma. The net external electric field is zero. So, the external field (r > R_shell) is zero. So, the sum of the electric fields from the wire and the shell must be zero.

Wait, the shell is non-conducting, so the electric field inside it is zero. Wait, no, because it's non-conducting, the charges can't move. So, the electric field inside the shell (r between R_wire and R_shell) would be due to the wire's charge. But the problem is about the external field (r > R_shell), and that's where the net E is zero.

Wait, perhaps I should model the electric fields.

The wire is a line charge with charge per unit length lambda. The shell is a cylinder with radius R_shell, and surface charge density sigma.

The shell's charge is sigma * 2π R_shell L, where L is the length. But because the shell is non-conducting, the surface charge is sigma, and the linear charge is sigma * 2π R_shell.

Wait, wait, the shell is a cylindrical surface. The linear charge density of the shell would be sigma * (2π R_shell), because it's a surface charge. So, the linear charge per unit length for the shell is lambda_shell = sigma * 2π R_shell.

Wait, but the wire is a line charge with charge density lambda_wire = -3.6 nC/m. The shell has linear charge density lambda_shell = sigma * (2 pi R_shell).

Wait, so the shell's linear charge density would be sigma * 2 pi R_shell.

Wait, but in Gauss's Law, the linear charge per unit length is the charge per unit length along the axis. So, yes, the shell's linear charge density is sigma * 2 pi R_shell.

But wait, wait, the shell is a nonconducting cylinder. So, the electric field inside the shell (r < R_shell) would be due to the wire, but the shell's own charge would contribute to the field outside.

But the problem says that the external electric field is zero. So, let's take a Gaussian surface outside the shell (r > R_shell). The electric field E must be zero there.

The total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the charge on the wire plus the charge on the shell. But wait, the shell's charge is sigma * 2 pi L R_shell. Because the surface area is 2 pi R L, so surface charge density sigma times 2 pi R L would give the charge.

Wait, but for a cylindrical Gaussian surface with radius r > R_shell, the enclosed charge would be the charge on the wire (lambda_wire * L) plus the charge on the shell (sigma * 2 pi R_shell * L).

Wait, but wait a second, the wire is a line charge, so its charge per unit length is lambda_wire = -3.6e-9 C/m. The shell's charge per unit length is lambda_shell = sigma * 2 pi R_shell. The length of the cylinder is L, but since it's the same for both, when considering the enclosed charge, it's lambda_wire * L plus lambda_shell * L.

But wait, the Gaussian surface in question is outside the shell (r > R_shell), so the enclosed charge is the sum of the wire's charge and the shell's charge.

So, the electric field E at radius r (r > R_shell) is given by Gauss's Law:

E * (2 π r L) = (lambda_wire + lambda_shell) * L / epsilon_0.

Because the Gaussian surface area is 2 π r L.

But the problem states that E must be zero. So,

lambda_wire + lambda_shell = 0.

Wait, is that correct? Because E is zero, so (lambda_wire + lambda_shell) must be zero. Because E is ( (lambda_total) / (2 pi r epsilon_0) ) * 2 pi r L = (lambda_total) * L / epsilon_0. So, E = lambda_total * L / (2 pi r epsilon_0). Hmm, but wait, the Gaussian surface area is 2 pi r L, so the equation is E * (2 pi r L) = Q_enc / epsilon_0.

Wait, perhaps I should write it correctly.

Gauss's Law in integral form is:

∮ E · dA = Q_enc / ε₀.

For a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius r > R_shell and length L, the left side is E * (2 π r L). The right side is (λ_wire + λ_shell) * L / ε₀.

Set E = 0, so:

0 = (λ_wire + λ_shell) * L / ε₀

So,

λ_wire + λ_shell = 0.

So,

λ_shell = - λ_wire.

Because lambda_shell is sigma * (2 pi R_shell), but wait, no: the shell's linear charge density is sigma * (2 pi R_shell). Wait, no, wait, the shell's charge per unit length is sigma * (2 pi R). Because it's a cylinder with radius R, so the surface area per unit length is 2 pi R, so sigma (charge per unit area) times 2 pi R gives the linear charge density.

So, lambda_shell = sigma * 2 pi R.

So,

lambda_shell = sigma * (2 pi R).

But lambda_wire is -3.6e-9 C/m.

So,

sigma * 2 pi R = 3.6e-9 C/m.

Wait, wait, because lambda_wire + lambda_shell = 0 → lambda_shell = -lambda_wire.

So,

sigma * 2 pi R = 3.6e-9 C/m.

Wait, but let me check the signs. The wire is negative, so lambda_wire is negative. So, we have:

lambda_wire + lambda_shell = 0 → lambda_shell = - lambda_wire.

lambda_wire = -3.6e-9 C/m → lambda_shell is 3.6e-9 C/m.

So,

sigma * 2 pi R = 3.6e-9 C/m.

So, sigma = (3.6e-9) / (2 pi R).

Given R is 1.5 cm, which is 0.015 m.

Let me compute that.

Calculate denominator: 2 * pi * 0.015.

2 * 3.1416 ≈6.2832. 6.2832 * 0.015 ≈0.094248.

So,

sigma = (3.6e-9) / 0.094248 ≈ 3.8e-8 C/m².

Wait, wait, 3.6e-9 / ~0.094 is approximately 3.8e-8.

Looking at the options, option A is 3.8e-8 C/m². So, that's the answer.

The problem involves a long, straight wire with a fixed negative charge density (3.6 nC/m) and a coaxial, thin-walled nonconducting cylindrical shell. The shell has a positive surface charge density σ on its outer surface, and the goal is to determine σ such that the net external electric field is zero.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Gauss's Law and Symmetry**:  
   The nonconducting shell is a cylindrical surface with radius \( R = 1.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.015 \, \text{m} \). The shell's surface charge density is \( \sigma \), and the wire's charge density is \( \lambda_{\text{wire}} = -3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C/m} \).  
   The net external electric field is zero, meaning the electric field due to the wire and the shell must cancel at \( r > R \).

2. **Electric Field Inside the Shell**:  
   For a Gaussian surface outside the shell (\( r > R \)), the electric field is determined by the total charge enclosed by the surface. The total charge enclosed is the sum of the wire's charge and the shell's charge. However, since the shell is nonconducting, its charge is distributed on its outer surface.

3. **Surface Charge Density Relation**:  
   The shell's linear charge density is given by \( \lambda_{\text{shell}} = \sigma \cdot 2\pi R \).  
   For the electric field to be zero outside the shell, the total charge enclosed by the shell must be zero:  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{wire}} + \lambda_{\text{shell}} = 0.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{wire}} = -3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C/m} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{shell}} = \sigma \cdot 2\pi R \), we get:  
   \[
   \sigma \cdot 2\pi R = 3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{C/m}.
   \]

4. **Solving for \( \sigma \)**:  
   Rearranging for \( \sigma \):  
   \[
   \sigma = \frac{3.6 \times 10^{-9}}{2\pi R}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( R = 0.015 \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   \sigma = \frac{3.6 \times 10^{-9}}{2\pi \cdot 0.015}.
   \]  
   Calculating the denominator:  
   \[
   2\pi \cdot 0.015 \approx 0.094248.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   \sigma = \frac{3.6 \times 10^{-9}}{0.094248} \approx 3.8 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C/m}^2.
   \]

5. **Answer Selection**:  
   The calculated value of \( \sigma \) matches option **A** (\( 3.8 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C/m}^2 \)).
