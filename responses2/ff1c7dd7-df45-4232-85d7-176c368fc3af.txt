Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the mean velocity of motion between two times, t=1 and t=10. The position of a point is given by the equations x=2t, y=ln(t), z=t². Hmm, I remember that mean velocity is the average change in position over a time interval. Oh right, it's the displacement divided by the time taken.

So, I need to find the displacement from t=1 to t=10. That would be the position at t=10 minus the position at t=1. Then, divide that by the time interval, which is 10-1=9 seconds.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll find the position at t=10. Plugging into x=2t, y=ln(10), and z=(10)^2. So x is 2*10=20. Y is natural log of 10, which is approximately 2.3026. Z is 100. 

Next, at t=1, x is 2*1=2, y is ln(1)=0, z is 1. 

Now the displacement in each dimension is the difference. So for x: 20-2=18. Y: 2.3026-0=2.3026. Z: 100-1=99. 

To find the total displacement vector, I need to find the magnitude of this vector. Because velocity is a vector, I have to consider the direction as well.

Wait, but the problem asks for the mean velocity, which is a vector. So I need to find the average displacement vector over the time interval. That would be the displacement vector divided by the time interval (9 seconds).

So the displacement in each component is:

Δx = 18
Δy = 2.3026
Δz = 99

So the displacement vector Δr is (18, 2.3026, 99). Now, the mean velocity v is this vector divided by 9.

So each component is:

vx = 18/9 = 2
vy = 2.3026/9 ≈ 0.2558
vz = 99/9 = 11

So the velocity vector is approximately (2, 0.2558, 11). Now, the magnitude of this vector is what we need for the speed, but wait, the question says mean velocity, which is a vector. But looking at the answer options, all are scalar numbers, so perhaps the question is expecting the magnitude? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the x-component, but that doesn't make sense because velocity is a vector.

Wait, no, mean velocity is a vector, so perhaps the problem expects the vector's magnitude. Or perhaps the options are scalar and I'm supposed to compute the magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the x-component, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, looking again at the problem statement, it says 'mean velocity of motion', which implies a vector. But the options are all single numbers, so maybe they are asking for the magnitude, or perhaps I'm supposed to compute the average vector direction.

Wait, no, in physics, mean velocity is the average displacement vector divided by time. So the vector is (18, 2.3026,99) divided by 9, which is the same as (2, 0.2558, 11). So the magnitude would be sqrt(2² + (0.2558)^2 + 11^2). Let me calculate that.

2 squared is 4. 0.2558 squared is about 0.065. 11 squared is 121. Adding them up: 4 + 0.065 + 121 = 125.065. Square root of that is approximately sqrt(125) is about 11.18, but wait, let me do it more accurately. 11.18 squared is about 125 (since 11^2=121, 11.18^2 is 125). So that would be approximately 11.18 m/s. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, the options are 9, 12.5, 13, 15, 14.2, 10, 7.75, 8.5, 9.75, 11.25.

Wait, none of these are close to 11.18. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check each step.

Wait, the displacement for x is 20-2=18, correct. Y is ln(10)-ln(1)=ln(10). That's correct. Z is 100-1=99. So displacement vector is (18, ln(10),99). Divided by 9: vx=2, vy= ln(10)/9 ≈ 2.3026/9≈0.2558, vz=11.

So the velocity vector is (2, 0.2558, 11). What's the magnitude? Let's compute 2^2 =4; (0.2558)^2≈0.0654; 11^2=121. So sum is 4 + 0.0654 +121 = 125.0654. Square root of 125.0654 is approximately 11.18 m/s. But the options don't have 11.2 or 11.18. Looking back at the options:

Options are:

A:9.00

B:12.50

C:13.00

D:15.00

E:14.20

F:10.00

G:7.75

H:8.50

I:9.75

J:11.25

So E is 14.20 and J is 11.25, but my calculation is about 11.18, which is closest to option J (11.25). But wait, perhaps I did a mistake in units or calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the x-component? Because the options have 11.25 as J. But that can't be right because velocity is a vector. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the average velocity's magnitude, not the vector. So the magnitude is sqrt( (18/9)^2 + (ln(10)/9)^2 + (99/9)^2 ). Wait, but that's the same as what I had before.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the position calculations. Let me recheck that.

x at t=10 is 2*10=20, correct. At t=1: x=2*1=2.

Y: ln(10) is approximately 2.302585. Correct.

Z: t²=100, correct.

So displacement in y is 2.302585 -0=2.302585.

So each component is 18, 2.302585, 99.

Divided by 9: 2, 0.255843, 11.

So the vector is (2, approximately 0.256, 11). The magnitude is sqrt(2² + (0.256)^2 +11²).

2² is 4.

0.256^2 is about 0.0655.

11^2 is 121.

Adding: 4 + 0.0655 + 121 = 125.0655.

Sqrt(125.0655) is approximately 11.185. So about 11.19 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:11.25. But wait, option E is 14.20, which is way higher. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let's recheck.

Wait, 2.302585 /9 is approximately 0.255843. Yes.

So the velocity's components are 2, ~0.256, 11.

So the magnitude is sqrt( (2)^2 + (0.256)^2 + (11)^2 )= sqrt(4 + 0.0655 + 121 )= sqrt(125.0655) ≈ 11.185. So about 11.19 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:11.25. But wait, the other options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the average velocity as a vector but as a scalar, perhaps the average speed, but that's not the case either. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in thinking about the displacement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the mean velocity as the displacement divided by the time, but perhaps the question is only considering the x-component. Because the options don't match my calculation.

Wait, but the way the problem is worded: "mean velocity of motion between times t=1 and t=10." That's a vector, but the options are all scalars. So perhaps the problem is only considering the x-component, but that doesn't make sense because a point moving in x, y, and z directions would have velocity in all three directions.

Wait, unless the problem is only considering the position's change in x-direction. Oh, but the wording doesn't say that. It says "mean velocity of motion," which is a vector.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mean velocity by taking the average of each component separately.

Wait, for x: (20-2)/9 =18/9=2.

For y: (ln(10) -0)/9= ln(10)/9≈0.2558.

For z: (100-1)/9=99/9=11.

So velocity vector is (2, 0.2558, 11). The magnitude is sqrt(2² + (ln(10)/9)^2 +11²).

Which is the same as before. So about 11.19 m/s.

But in the options, the closest is J:11.25. Hmm, but wait, option E is 14.2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Δy. Let me compute ln(10) more accurately. 

Natural logarithm of 10 is approximately 2.302585093. So 2.302585093 /9 is approximately 0.255843.

So the velocity in y is 0.2558 m/s.

In x, 2 m/s.

In z, 11 m/s.

So the velocity vector's magnitude is sqrt( (2)^2 + (0.2558)^2 + (11)^2 )= sqrt(4 + 0.0655 + 121) = sqrt(125.0655) ≈11.185 m/s.

Looking at the options, option J is 11.25, which is very close. So why isn't that the correct answer? Because the options don't have 11.185, but J is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I don't see it.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the x-component. Because the other options are much higher. Let's think: If the problem had been 'mean velocity in the x-direction', then the answer would be 2 m/s, but that's not an option. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is just asking for the magnitude, but in that case, the answer would be approximately 11.185, which is closer to 11.25 (option J) than to 10.00 (F).

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, the position is given by x=2t, y=ln(t), z=t². So the displacement over t=1 to t=10 is:

x: 20-2=18.

y: ln(10) - ln(1) = ln(10).

z:100-1=99.

Time interval:9.

So velocity components: 18/9=2, ln(10)/9 ≈0.2558, and 99/9=11.

The magnitude is sqrt(2² + (ln(10)/9)^2 + 11^2).

Which is about sqrt(4 + 0.0655 +121)=sqrt(125.0655)= about 11.185.

So the closest option is J:11.25.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because none of the other options match this number. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:9.00

B:12.50

C:13.00

D:15.00

E:14.20

F:10.00

G:7.75

H:8.50

I:9.75

J:11.25

So J is 11.25, which is very close to 11.185. So why isn't the correct answer J? Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the average velocity as a vector, but the options don't present that. Because the options are all single numbers, perhaps the problem is expecting the magnitude of the velocity vector. So the correct answer would be approximately 11.185 m/s, which is closest to 11.25 (option J).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the displacement in y. Let me double-check ln(10):

ln(10) ≈2.302585093. So 2.302585093 /9 = 0.255843... So that's correct.

So the velocity vector is (2, 0.2558,11) and magnitude about 11.185.

So the answer should be J:11.25.

To determine the mean velocity of motion between times \( t=1 \) and \( t=10 \), we calculate the displacement vector and divide it by the time interval. The position of the point is given by:

\[
x = 2t, \quad y = \ln(t), \quad z = t^2.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the position at \( t=1 \) and \( t=10 \)
- At \( t=1 \):
  \[
  x = 2(1) = 2, \quad y = \ln(1) = 0, \quad z = 1^2 = 1.
  \]
- At \( t=10 \):
  \[
  x = 2(10) = 20, \quad y = \ln(10) \approx 2.3026, \quad z = 10^2 = 100.
  \]

### Step 2: Compute the displacement vector
The displacement in each dimension is:
- \( \Delta x = 20 - 2 = 18 \),
- \( \Delta y = 2.3026 - 0 = 2.3026 \),
- \( \Delta z = 100 - 1 = 99 \).

The displacement vector is:
\[
\Delta \vec{r} = (18, 2.3026, 99).
\]

### Step 3: Compute the mean velocity vector
The mean velocity vector is the displacement vector divided by the time interval \( \Delta t = 10 - 1 = 9 \):
\[
\vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t} = \left( \frac{18}{9}, \frac{2.3026}{9}, \frac{99}{9} \right) = (2, 0.2558, 11).
\]

### Step 4: Compute the magnitude of the mean velocity vector
The magnitude of the velocity vector is:
\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (0.2558)^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{4 + 0.0655 + 121} = \sqrt{125.0655} \approx 11.185 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated magnitude of the mean velocity is approximately \( 11.185 \, \text{m/s} \). Among the options provided, the closest value is \( 11.25 \, \text{m/s} \) (option J).
