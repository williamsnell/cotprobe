Okay, so I've got this question about why the human appendix is considered a vestigial organ. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think through this.

The question asks which statement least supports the claim that the appendix is completely vestigial. So, if I'm looking for the answer that points out that the appendix isn't completely gone, that would be the correct choice.

Looking at the options:

A: The size varies a lot. Well, that's true. The appendix is big in most people, so that doesn't negate it being vestigial. It just tells us it's a common organ.

B: Larger appendages leave fewer offspring. I remember something about the appendix being linked to reproductive success. I think larger appendages are linked to higher fertility. So this would actually support the idea that the appendix is important for reproduction, making it vestigial because it's still present in those with larger sizes. So this statement would not be the answer.

C: The appendix is near the large intestine. That's true, but it's more about location. If the appendix were vestigial, it would still be there, so this statement itself doesn't show it's gone. So it supports the idea that it's still present, not that it's vestigial.

D: It's not present in all mammals. Wait, that's a strong point. All mammals have the appendix, right? Or at least, that's what I remember as a fact. So this statement would directly contradict the idea that it's vestigial. If it's not present in all mammals, then it must be non-vestigial. That would be the strongest reason to say the appendix isn't vestigial, which is what the question is asking.

E: It can be removed without issues. This is a medical fact. If it were completely vestigial, removing it might lead to severe problems, but if it's still present, it probably wouldn't. But this is more about medical procedures and doesn't directly address whether it's vestigial. It's a true statement but doesn't contradict it.

F: Fossils show it was larger in hominids. This is about the size of the appendix in ancient humans. If it were vestigial, we'd expect it to be large. But this doesn't negate the vestigial nature because it's still present. So this supports the idea that it's present, not that it's gone.

G: It has defensive lymphatic tissue. The appendix is known to have that. So this statement supports the idea that it's still functional, not vestigial.

H: It's inflamed during appendicitis. This shows that it's used in the body, so it's not vestigial. It's still functional.

I: Many people live healthy after removing it. This is about the medical aspectâ€”removal doesn't cause problems, which would be the case if it's still functioning. So this supports the idea that it's present.

J: No known function in digestion. This is a strong fact because digestion doesn't involve the appendix. So this statement directly contradicts the idea of it being vestigial, because if it were vestigial, it would have contributed to digestion. Since it's not known to function, it's non-vestigial.

So the question is asking which statement most detracts from the claim. The least supportive of the claim would be the one that doesn't show that the appendix is still there.

Looking again, option D says it's not present in all mammals. That directly contradicts the idea of it being vestigial because if it were, it would be present. So this statement would make the claim that the appendix is vestigial false, as it's not present everywhere. Therefore, D is the correct answer.

The appendix is considered a vestigial organ if it is not present in all mammals. Option D, "The appendix is not present in all mammal species," directly contradicts the idea of the appendix being vestigial, as it would imply the appendix is absent in some mammals. This statement strongly supports the claim that the appendix is not completely vestigial. 

Answer: D
