Question:

A developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural part of the county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. The franchise right created for public utilitycompanies would most likely be an example of a(an)

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically about general development plans and the types of restrictions they impose. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a developer who has several hundred acres in a rural area. They drafted a general development plan, and there are some restrictions in place. The problem is asking what type of restriction it is, specifically looking at option (22) which says a franchise right is created in a 10-foot-wide strip along the rear of each lot. The options are from A to H.

First, I need to remember what types of restrictions are in property law. The common ones I know are easements, covenants, licenses, and servitudes. 

Let me recall each:
- **Easement in gross**: This is a right of way allowing others to use the land without permission, but it's not a legal agreement. It's just permission granted by the owner. The right extends over the entire property. It's usually a public right of way.
- **Easement in servitude**: This is a legal agreement that allows others to use the land without permission, and it's legally binding. The owner holds the right of way and can't use it for sale or convey. So it's a legal right of passage, like a license.
- **License**: This is a legal right of passage granted by the owner to others. It allows others to use the land without permission. It's similar to easement in servitude but more formal.
- **Real covenant**: This refers to a contract between the parties, like a lease or buy-out agreement, which is enforceable against others. It's about a specific promise.
- **Allodial title**: Not sure, maybe it's a typo, but I think it's about a title restriction where the title holder is bound to a party. But I'm not certain.
- **Restrictive covenant**: This is a covenant that imposes conditions on others, but it's not binding on others unless the covenant is enforced by the owner. The covenant is usually enforceable against others, but not against the owner unless it's a tenancy covenant.
- **Profit à-Pékin**: That's a specific type of fee simple for land that was first used for profit. It's a special type of fee simple that allows the owner to keep the property for a specific period to generate profit, and the property is then sold as a fee simple.
- **Easement appurtenant**: This is a right of way that is attached to a specific property, such as a building or structure. It's a type of easement that is specifically for use on that building or structure.
- **Allodial title**: Another possible typo, but I'm not sure what it means.

Now, looking back at the question. The restriction creates a franchise right in a strip of land adjacent to each lot. A franchise right is a type of easement that is granted to a specific group (like the public utility companies) and is not subject to the same restrictions as other easements. It's usually a public right of way because it's granted by the owner and is a legal right of passage.

Looking at the options:

Option (22) says a franchise right is created. So, according to the options, what is the correct term for a franchise right? I think a franchise right is a type of license. Wait, no—let me think again. A license is a legal right of passage, like when another party can use the land without permission. A franchise right is the same thing as a license but with the added condition that the owner gives the right to the group but not to the individual. So, the type of restriction is a license.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is license. Option F is profit à-Pékin, which is a fee simple for profit. Option G is easement in gross. Option H is allodial title. Option I is easement appurtenant.

Wait, but the question is about what the franchise right is an example of. So, a franchise right is a form of license. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes a franchise right is treated as a license.

Alternatively, maybe it's a restrictive covenant. Because restrictive covenants are agreements that impose conditions but are not binding unless the owner acts to enforce them. So, I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the type of restriction. Let me consider what each option refers to.

Option A: restrictive covenant. That's a covenant that could be restrictive, but restrictive covenants are usually only binding if the owner acts to enforce them, not otherwise. So, restrictive covenants are not examples of licenses or servitudes.

Option B: license. This is the legal right of passage granted by the owner to others, like the public utilities. So, the franchise right in this case would be an example of a license.

Option G: easement in gross. That's a right of way without any specific use, just permission for others to use the land. So, it's more about permission than a franchise right.

Option H: allodial title. I'm not sure what that means. Maybe it's about a title restriction where the title holder is bound to a party. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: a franchise right is a form of license. So, the correct answer would be B: license.

Wait, but let me make sure. In property law, a franchise right is a type of license. Yes, a franchise right is a legal agreement that grants others permission to use the land without permission, but the owner retains the right of way to use the land for sale or convey. So, it's a license.

So, the options are:

A: restrictive covenant.
B: license.
C: real covenant.
D: equitable servitude.
E: covenant running with the land.
F: profit à-Pékin.
G: easement in gross.
H: allodial title.
I: easement appurtenant.

Wait, option I is easement appurtenant, which is a right of way attached to a specific property. So, it's similar to a franchise right but attached to a building or structure. But in this case, the restriction is in the strip of land adjacent to each lot. So, it's a general franchise right, not specific to a building. So, probably not I.

So, the correct answer is B: license.

The question involves identifying the type of restriction in a general development plan where a franchise right is created in a specific strip of land. A franchise right is a legal agreement granting others permission to use the land without permission, typically by the owner. It is not binding unless the owner acts to enforce it, making it a form of license. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Restrictive covenant** is not correct because restrictive covenants are usually only binding if the owner acts to enforce them.
- **B: License** is correct as a franchise right aligns with a legal right of passage granted by the owner.
- **C: Real covenant** is incorrect because real covenants are agreements between parties, not restrictive.
- **D: Equitable servitude** refers to a legal right of passage, which is similar to a license.
- **E: Covenants running with the land** is not applicable here.
- **F: Profit à-Pékin** refers to a fee simple for profit, not relevant.
- **G: Easement in gross** refers to permission without specific use.
- **H: Allodial title**, unclear, but likely incorrect.
- **I: Easement appurtenant** applies to rights attached to specific properties.
- **J: Allodial title** is incorrect.

The correct answer is **B: license**, as the franchise right fits the definition of a legal right of passage.
