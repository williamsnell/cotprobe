Question:

Company A has found that if it offers a guarantee on its transistor radios, more will be sold than without the guarantee. In a year, the company expects to sell 100 radios if no guarantee is offered, but if the length of the guarantee is t years then the number sold will be Q = 100 + 5t. It is known that 10% of radios sold will fail each year. The cost of fixing a radio is $1 and a profit of $2.80 is made on every radio sold. What is the length of the guarantee period t that maximizes profit?

C: 6 years
D: 4 years
E: 8 years
F: 10 years
G: 9 years

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about Company A and their transistor radios. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The company offers a guarantee on their radios. The number of radios sold without a guarantee is 100 each year. But if they offer a guarantee for t years, the number sold increases by 5t, so Q = 100 + 5t. 

Now, it says 10% of the radios fail each year. So for each year, 10% of the radios are expected to fail. The cost to fix each radio is $1, and the profit per radio sold is $2.80.

The question is asking for the length of the guarantee period t that maximizes profit. The options are from A (1 year) to J (10 years). 

I need to find the value of t that maximizes the total profit. Let's outline the steps I should take.

First, I need to calculate the number of radios sold, which is Q = 100 +5t. But then, each year, 10% fail, so the number that actually stay is 90% of Q. Because if it's 10% that fail, 90% pass.

Wait, but the problem says "the length of the guarantee is t years" and the number sold is Q = 100 +5t. So I think that's correct. So the number of radios that actually survive t years is 0.9 * Q. Because each year, 10% fail, so each year the number of radios that don't fail is 90% of the previous year's count.

So the number of radios that actually stay after t years is 0.9 * (100 +5t). 

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that the number sold is Q =100 +5t when a guarantee is offered for t years. So Q is the total number sold, including those that fail. Because if a radio fails, it's not sold, right? So the 10% failure rate would mean that for each radio sold, 10% don't sell, so 90% do. So the actual number sold is 90% of Q. So the number sold is 0.9*(100+5t).

Yes, that makes sense. So the number sold is 0.9*(100 +5t).

Now, for each radio sold, there's a cost to fix. If a radio fails, it's fixed, and the cost is $1 per radio. So the total cost is the number of radios sold multiplied by $1.

The profit per radio is $2.80. So the total profit is (number of radios sold) * $2.80 minus the total cost (number of radios sold * $1).

Let me write that out: Profit = (Number Sold) * (2.80 - 1.00) = (Number Sold) * 1.80.

Wait, because for each radio sold, the profit is $2.80 minus the $1 cost. So yeah, 1.80 per radio.

So the profit in terms of t is:

Profit(t) = [0.9*(100 +5t)] * 1.80.

Let me compute that:

0.9 * (100 +5t) = 90 +4.5t.

Multiply by 1.80:

(90 +4.5t) *1.80 = 90*1.80 +4.5t*1.80.

Calculating 90*1.80: 90*1.8 is 162, because 9*1.8 is 16.2, so 90*1.8 is 162.

4.5t *1.80: 4.5 *1.8 is 8.1, so 8.1t.

So Profit(t) = 162 +8.1t.

Wait, that can't be right because 162 is a constant, and 8.1t increases with t. But that would suggest that profit keeps increasing as t increases, which can't be correct because after a certain point, the additional radios sold might not be worth the cost of the guarantee. Hmm, but wait, in the problem statement, if they offer a longer guarantee, more radios are sold, but each radio sold after the first has lower profit. Wait, no, in this case, each radio sold gives a profit of $1.80, regardless of when it's sold. So actually, the profit would be proportional to the number of radios sold, meaning that the more radios sold, the higher the profit. But that would imply that the profit is linear with t, hence, the longer the guarantee, the more profit. But that doesn't make sense because as t increases, Q =100+5t increases, so the number sold increases, leading to higher profit. But that can't be, because maybe the cost of the guarantee is a fixed cost. Wait, but in the problem statement, it doesn't mention whether the cost of the guarantee is a fixed cost or variable. Wait, the problem says: "The company expects to sell 100 radios if no guarantee is offered, but if the length of the guarantee is t years then the number sold will be Q = 100 +5t." So maybe the cost of the guarantee is a one-time cost. Let me re-read.

The cost of fixing a radio is $1. So if a radio fails, it needs to be fixed, costing $1 per radio. So for each radio that fails, $1 is spent. So the total cost is number of failed radios * $1. 

The number of failed radios is 10% of Q, since 10% fail each year. So number of failed radios is 0.10 * Q.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think: if the guarantee is t years, it's possible that the radio could fail in any of the t years, but the problem says "the length of the guarantee is t years then the number sold will be Q = 100 +5t." Hmm, perhaps the Q is the number that survive. So if a radio fails, it's not sold. So the number sold is 0.9 * Q. Alternatively, maybe the number sold is Q, but the number that actually fail is 0.10 * Q.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: when a company offers a t-year guarantee, each radio has a t-year lifespan, and each year, 10% fail. So the probability that a radio doesn't fail in t years is (0.9)^t. Because each year, 90% survive. So the expected number of radios that don't fail is Q * (0.9)^t. But in the problem, it's given that Q =100 +5t. That might be a simplification, perhaps assuming that each year, the number sold increases by 5. But that's not a probability.

Wait, maybe the problem is using Q as the actual number sold, regardless of when they fail. So if Q =100 +5t, that's the number that are sold, irrespective of their survival. But if a radio fails, it's not sold, so the number that are sold is less than Q. So perhaps the number sold is Q * (1 - failure probability). But the problem says the number sold is Q=100+5t. So perhaps the 'failures' are already accounted for in this Q. So maybe the Q is the number that survive, but the problem states that the number sold is Q. So perhaps the problem is just taking Q as the number sold, regardless of their status. That is, perhaps the 10% failure is not considered in the Q, but the Q is the number sold, which includes all the radios that are sold, regardless of whether they failed. Or perhaps it's the number that survive. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is that the company sells Q =100 +5t radios, each of which has a 10% chance of failing. So the number sold without guarantee is 100, and for each t, it's 100 +5t, so for t years, the number sold increases by 5 each year. 

Wait, but the problem says: "the length of the guarantee is t years then the number sold will be Q = 100 +5t." So I think the Q is the number sold, which is 100 +5t. So the 10% failure refers to the radios that are sold. So perhaps the 10% is the probability that a radio that is sold fails. So the number that survive is Q * 0.9. But the problem states Q =100 +5t, which suggests that Q is the number that survive. So perhaps the problem is using Q as the number of radios that survive, but the actual number sold is 0.9 * Q. But the problem says that Q = 100 +5t, so I'm not sure. 

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the given Q =100 +5t as the number sold. So the profit per radio is $2.80, and the cost per radio is $1. So for each radio sold, the profit is $1.80. 

So profit(t) = (number sold) * 1.80 - (number sold) *1 (cost) = number sold * 0.80. Wait, no, because the cost is $1 per radio, and the profit is $2.80 per radio, so profit per radio is $1.80. So profit(t) = (number sold) * 1.80.

Number sold is Q =100 +5t. So profit(t) = (100 +5t) * 1.80.

Wait, that simplifies to 180 +9t.

Wait, but that can't be right because it would suggest that profit increases linearly with t. But if the company offers a longer guarantee, they sell more radios, but each radio's profit is fixed at $1.80. So profit would increase with t. But this can't be correct because, as t increases, the cost of the guarantee might be a one-time cost, not per radio. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem says: "the cost of fixing a radio is $1." So maybe the cost is $1 per radio, regardless of when it's sold. So for each radio that is sold, the company has to fix it if it fails. So the total cost is the number of radios that fail (which is 10% of Q) multiplied by $1. 

So the cost is 0.10 * Q * $1. The profit per radio is $2.80, so total profit is (Q - 0.10 Q) * $2.80 - 0.10 Q * $1.

Wait, let's compute that.

Total radios sold = Q =100 +5t.

Number of radios that fail = 0.10 Q.

Number sold without failing = 0.9 Q.

Profit per radio is $2.80, so total profit is (0.9 Q) * 2.80 - (0.1 Q) * 1.

Which simplifies to (2.52 Q) - (0.1 Q) = 2.42 Q.

So profit(t) = 2.42 * (100 +5t) = 242 +12.1 t.

Wait, that's a linear function, profit increases with t. But that would suggest that the longer the guarantee, the higher the profit, which can't be correct because at some point, the cost of the guarantee might outweigh the additional profit. But according to the problem statement, the cost is $1 per radio and fixed. So maybe the cost is a one-time cost. But the problem doesn't mention that. It just says "the cost of fixing a radio is $1." So perhaps the cost is $1 per radio, regardless of when it's fixed. In that case, the profit per radio is $2.80, and the cost is $1, so the net profit per radio is $1.80. Thus, the total profit is (number sold) * $1.80.

So if number sold is Q =100 +5t, then profit(t) = 1.80*(100 +5t) = 180 +9t.

Wait, but if that's the case, then profit increases linearly with t, which would imply that the longer the guarantee, the higher the profit. But that doesn't make sense because after a certain point, the number of radios sold might not increase as expected. Or perhaps the model assumes that the company can sell 100 +5t radios, regardless of the guarantee length, which is given in the problem. So this suggests that the longer the guarantee, the more radios are sold, leading to higher profit.

Wait, but then the problem becomes a linear function, and the maximum occurs at higher t. However, looking at the options, the maximum t is 10 years (option J). So according to this, the maximum profit would be at t=10, but that doesn't make sense if the function is increasing. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the cost of the guarantee is a fixed cost (like a one-time fee) plus the cost per radio. So the total cost would be Cost = c + (number sold) *1, where c is a fixed cost. Then profit would be (number sold)*2.80 - cost. So profit = (100 +5t)*2.80 - (c + (100 +5t)*1).

But the problem doesn't mention any fixed cost, so perhaps the cost is only variable (i.e., per radio). So in that case, the profit would be (100 +5t)*2.80 - (100 +5t)*1 = (100 +5t)*1.80, which is linear as before.

But that would mean the longer the guarantee, the higher the profit, so to maximize profit, the company would choose the longest guarantee, which is option J (10 years). But that doesn't seem right because the problem's options don't have that as the only choice.

Wait, but the problem says that the company expects to sell 100 radios if no guarantee is offered. So when a guarantee is offered, the number sold increases. But if each additional radio sold adds 1.80 to the profit, then the longer the guarantee, the higher the profit. So the company would want the longest guarantee. So why would it not be the case? Because perhaps the number sold isn't actually increasing as the guarantee lengthens, but that's not what the problem states.

Wait, perhaps the model is different. Maybe the number sold is Q =100 +5t, but each year, 10% fail, so the number sold after t years is Q * (0.9)^t, but the problem says Q is the number sold. So perhaps the problem is using Q as the number sold, and 10% failing is a separate consideration. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the number sold is Q, and the cost to fix each radio is $1, regardless of when they're sold. So for each radio sold, whether it fails or not, the company has to spend $1. So the total cost is Q *1.

Thus, total profit is (number sold) * (profit per radio) - total cost.

Profit per radio is $2.80, so total profit is (Q) * 2.80 - Q *1 = Q *1.80.

Since Q =100 +5t, profit(t)=1.80*(100 +5t)= 180 +9t.

Again, this is linear, so the longer the guarantee, the higher the profit. But that doesn't make sense because the problem's options don't have an "infinite" t, so perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the number sold is Q, but the number that actually survive is 0.9^t * Q. So the number that fail is 1 -0.9^t * Q. But this complicates things further, but the problem states that the number sold is Q=100+5t. So I think I should proceed with that.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, it's given that when the guarantee is t years, the number sold is Q=100+5t. So perhaps it's a linear model, and the longer the guarantee, the higher the profit. So the company would want the longest possible guarantee, which is option J (10 years). But let's check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:2, B:3, C:6, D:4, E:8, F:10, G:9, H:7, I:1, J:5.

If the profit is increasing with t, the maximum would be at t=10, so option J. But perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, let me re-express the profit function.

If the number sold is Q =100 +5t, and each radio contributes a profit of $1.80, then profit is 1.80 * (100 +5t). So the profit increases as t increases. But the question is to find the t that maximizes profit, which would be t=10, but looking at the options, J is 5. Wait, no, the options are:

A:2

B:3

C:6

D:4

E:8

F:10

G:9

H:7

I:1

J:5

Wait, no, according to the options, J is 5. So in this case, the profit would be maximized at t=10, which is option F. But according to my previous calculation, the profit increases with t, so the maximum is at the largest possible t, which is 10. So the correct answer would be F:10 years.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the model. Let me think again.

Suppose the number sold is Q =100 +5t. So for each year, 5 more radios are sold. The number sold is increasing linearly with t.

Each radio contributes a profit of $1.80. So the profit is 1.80*(100 +5t) = 180 +9t.

So the function increases with t, so to maximize profit, we need the largest possible t, which is 10 years (option F). 

Wait, but the problem includes a "cost of fixing a radio is $1." So for each radio, the company must spend $1 to fix it if it fails. So the total cost is the number of radios sold multiplied by $1. So total cost is Q*1.

Thus, profit is (Q *1.80) - (Q *1) = 0.80 * Q.

Wait, this is different from before. So profit is 0.80 * (100 +5t) = 80 +4t.

Ah, that's a different model. So profit increases linearly with t. So the longer the guarantee, the more profit. So to maximize profit, the company should choose the longest possible t, which is 10 years (option F).

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the cost of fixing a radio is $1, which would apply to each radio, regardless of when it's sold. So the profit per radio is $1.80 (because it's sold and fixed) minus $1 (fixed cost), giving $0.80 per radio. So the total profit is 0.80 * (100 +5t).

Thus, the profit increases with t. So the longer the guarantee, the higher the profit. Therefore, the maximum is at the largest t, which is option F (10 years).

But earlier, I thought the profit increases with t because profit per radio is fixed. But that's not the case. The cost of fixing a radio is $1, regardless of when it's sold. So the profit per radio is $1.80, but the company has to pay $1 for each radio to fix it, which means that for each radio that fails, the company has to spend $1. So for each radio that is sold, the net profit is $0.80. So the total profit is 0.80*(number of radios sold) =0.80*(100 +5t).

So that would increase with t. Therefore, the maximum occurs at the highest t, which is 10 years (option F).

Wait, but the problem gives the options up to 10 years. So according to this, the correct answer is F (10 years).

Another possibility: perhaps the company's profit per radio is $1.80, but the cost of the guarantee is a fixed cost. So let's compute the total cost as C = fixed cost, plus cost per radio, which is $1, times the number of radios sold, which is Q =100 +5t.

So profit = (number sold) * (profit per radio) - (fixed cost + number sold * cost per radio).

But since the problem doesn't mention a fixed cost, perhaps it's assumed that the cost of the guarantee is zero. So in that case, the profit is 1.80*(100 +5t) = 180 +9t, which increases with t.

So in that case, the maximum would be at the largest possible t, which is 10 years (option F).

But wait, the problem says that 10% of the radios fail each year. So if a radio fails, it's not sold. So the number of radios sold is less than Q. But the problem states that the number sold is Q=100 +5t. So perhaps the problem is assuming that all the radios that are sold, including those that fail each year, are accounted for in Q. But that's not correct because the radios that fail are not sold. So Q is the number that survived. Therefore, the number sold is 0.9 Q.

So the number sold is 0.9*(100 +5t) = 90 +4.5 t.

So total profit is (number sold) * (profit per radio) - (number sold) * (cost per radio).

Profit per radio is $1.80, so total profit is (90 +4.5 t)*1.80 - (90 +4.5 t)*1.

Which is (90 +4.5 t)*(1.80 -1) = (90 +4.5 t)*0.80.

Which is 72 + 3.6 t.

So the profit increases with t, so the maximum occurs at the largest t, which is 10 years (option F).

Wait, so according to this model, the profit increases with t, so the correct answer is F (10 years).

But earlier, I considered that the profit per radio is $1.80, and the cost per radio is $1, leading to a profit of $0.80 per radio, but that's only if the cost is fixed. But if the cost is variable, then the profit per radio is $1.80, regardless of whether it fails. So perhaps the correct model is that the profit per radio is $1.80, and the cost per radio is $1, leading to a profit of $0.80 per radio, and thus the total profit is 0.80*(number sold).

So let's recalculate.

Number sold is 0.9 Q =0.9*(100 +5t)=90 +4.5 t.

Profit per radio is $1.80.

Total profit: (90 +4.5 t)*1.80 - (90 +4.5 t)*1.

Which simplifies to (90 +4.5 t)*(1.80 -1) = (90 +4.5 t)*0.80.

So profit(t) =72 +3.6 t.

So profit increases with t. So at t=10, profit is 72+36=108, while for t=5, it's 72+18=90.

So the maximum occurs at t=10, which is option F.

Wait, so the correct answer is F (10 years).

But let me think again. If the profit per radio is $1.80, and the cost per radio is $1, then the profit per radio is $0.80. So the total profit would be 0.80*(number sold). Number sold is 0.9 Q =0.9*(100 +5t)=90 +4.5t.

So profit(t) =0.80*(90 +4.5t) =72 +3.6t.

Yes, that's correct. So profit increases with t. So the maximum is at t=10, which is option F.

But wait, what if the cost is fixed, say $100, then the profit would be different. But the problem doesn't mention any fixed costs, so I think the correct model is that the profit per radio is $1.80, and the cost per radio is $1, so the profit per radio is $0.80, and thus the profit is 0.80*(number sold). 

So according to this, the answer is F (10 years). But wait, the problem statement says that the cost of fixing a radio is $1. So the cost per radio is $1. So if the profit per radio is $1.80, then the net profit per radio is $0.80, as I thought.

So, according to this, the total profit is 0.80*(number sold). Number sold is 0.9*(100 +5t)=90 +4.5t.

So profit(t) =0.80*(90 +4.5t) =72 +3.6t.

So as t increases, profit increases.

So, to maximize profit, choose the largest t, which is 10 years (option F).

So the correct answer is F (10 years).
</think>

The profit per radio is $1.80, and the cost per radio is $1, resulting in a net profit of $0.80 per radio. The number of radios sold is 0.9 times the guarantee length plus 100, so the profit function is linear in t.

**Calculations:**

- Profit per radio: $1.80
- Cost per radio: $1
- Net profit per radio: $0.80
- Number of radios sold: 0.9*(100 +5t) = 90 +4.5t
- Total profit: 0.80*(90 +4.5t) = 72 +3.6t

As t increases, the total profit increases. Therefore, the longest guarantee (t=10) yields the highest profit.

**Answer:** F) 10 years.
