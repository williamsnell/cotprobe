Question:

What is the heat shock response ?

Options:

A: Heat shock is a response where cells decrease the overall transcription rate and maintain only vital functions at high temperatures
B: Heat shock is a response where cells increase the transcription of all genes uniformly in response to high temperatures
C: Heat shock is a response to cold temperatures
D: Heat shock is a response where cells only transcribe heat shock genes under normal temperature conditions
E: Heat shock is a response where cells stop transcribing the previously active genes and instead transcribe a new set of genes called heat shock genes when the temperature is raised.
F: Heat shock is a state where cells rapidly divide in response to high temperatures
G: Heat shock is a response where cells continue to transcribe the same genes despite high temperatures
H: Heat shock is a response where cells primarily transcribe heat shock genes in extremely low temperatures
I: Heat shock is a cellular process that repairs DNA damage caused by high temperatures without altering gene transcription
J: Heat shock is a gene mutation caused by high temperatures

Okay, so I need to figure out what the correct answer is for this heat shock response question. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the heat shock response. I remember that when organisms are exposed to high temperatures, they undergo a specific response to prevent damage. I think this response is crucial for maintaining normal cell function and growth.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Decrease overall transcription rate and maintain vital functions. That sounds familiar. I remember that cells have a threshold temperature. Below that, they can grow, but above, they start to compensate. So they might decrease their normal gene expression to deal with the stress. So A might be the right answer.

Option B: Increase all genes uniformly. That doesn't sound right. If genes are increased, it might cause more damage, not the right response. Probably not B.

Option C: Heat shock response to cold. No, the question is about heat, so C is unrelated.

Option D: Only transcribe heat shock genes under normal conditions. Wait, no. Heat shock response typically occurs after the temperature rises. So D might not be correct. Unless under normal conditions, they don't need to respond, but that doesn't fit.

Option E: Cells stop transcribing previously active genes and start heat shock genes. That sounds similar to A, but E says stop and start new. But the response is usually a balance, maybe. Not sure.

Option F: Rapid division. Heat shock is more about cell survival and growth than quick division.

Option G: Continue transcribing same genes. No, that's not the response. The response is to upregulate others.

Option H: Heat shock genes in extremely low temps. Not necessarily, because it's more about the medium temperature that triggers the response.

Option I: DNA repair without altering transcription. I think repair is another process, like nucleotide excision repair. Not the heat shock response.

Option J: Mutation caused by high temps. No, mutations are usually from mutations in genes, not environmental stress.

So, reviewing, the correct response is when cells decrease their normal gene expression to deal with high temperatures, which maintains vital functions. So option A sounds right.

The correct answer is **A: Heat shock is a response where cells decrease the overall transcription rate and maintain only vital functions at high temperatures**.
