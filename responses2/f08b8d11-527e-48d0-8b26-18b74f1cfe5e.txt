Question:

Suppose that 54% of the graduates from your high school go on to 4-year colleges, 20% go on to 2-year colleges, 19% find employment, and the remaining 7% search for a job.

Options:

A: 0.700

D: 0.580
E: 0.630
F: 0.675

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question says: Suppose that 54% of high school graduates go on to 4-year colleges, 20% go on to 2-year colleges, 19% find employment, and the remaining 7% search for a job. Now, we're told that a randomly selected student is not going on to a 2-year college. What's the probability she'll be going to a 4-year college?

Hmm, okay. So I think this is a conditional probability question. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of one event happening given that another event has already happened. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability of A given B.

In this case, event A is going to a 4-year college, and event B is not going to a 2-year college. So I need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

Wait, let me think. So the student isn't going to a 2-year college. That means she either goes to a 4-year college, finds employment, or perhaps searches for a job. But the problem says the remaining 7% search for a job. Wait, does that mean these are the other options beyond 4-year and 2-year colleges?

Wait, the percentages are given as 54% for 4-year, 20% for 2-year, 19% for employment, and 7% for searching for a job. So, let's add them up to make sure they total 100%: 54 + 20 is 74, plus 19 is 93, plus 7 is 100%. So that's all accounted for.

So if the student is not going to a 2-year college, that means she is either going to a 4-year college, finding employment, or searching for a job. But the question is about the probability that she'll be going to a 4-year college, given she's not going to a 2-year college.

So, the sample space for event B (not going to 2-year college) is the sum of the probabilities of the other categories. So P(B) = P(4-year) + P(employment) + P(searching) = 54% + 19% + 7% = 80%.

Wait, but hold on, 54% are 4-year, 20% are 2-year, 19% are employment, and 7% are searches. So, the not 2-year would be 54 +19 +7 = 80%. So P(B) is 80%.

Wait no, but the problem says the student is not going to a 2-year college. So she could be in the other three categories: 4-year (54%), employment (19%), or searching (7%).

Wait, but the question is about the probability she is in 4-year college given that she's not in 2-year. So P(A|B) = P(4-year) / P(not 2-year).

But wait, wait, no. Because P(4-year) is 54%, and P(not 2-year) is 80% as I calculated. So 54% /80% is 0.675, which is 67.5%. But looking at the options, option F is 0.675, which is 67.5%. But wait, wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says the student is not going to a 2-year college. So the total probability for that is 54 +19 +7 =80%. So the conditional probability is 54 /80. Let me compute that.

54 divided by 80. Let me see, 54 รท80. Well, 54 รท80 equals 0.675, which is 67.5%. So the probability would be 0.675, which is option F.

But wait, wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because sometimes when dealing with probabilities, especially when some categories overlap, it can get tricky, but in this case, the categories are mutually exclusive. So each category is a separate outcome.

So, the student is in one category only. So, the total probability of not being in 2-year is the sum of the other three.

So yes, P(A|B) = 54/80 = 0.675. So the answer should be F: 0.675.

The problem involves calculating the conditional probability that a student will go to a 4-year college given that she is not going to a 2-year college. We use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

Here:
- A is the event of going to a 4-year college.
- B is the event of not going to a 2-year college.

P(A and B) is the probability of both events happening, which is the same as P(A) since A is a subset of B. 

P(A) = 54%, P(B) = 54% + 19% + 7% = 80%.

Thus, P(A|B) = 54% / 80% = 0.675.

The correct answer is F: 0.675.
