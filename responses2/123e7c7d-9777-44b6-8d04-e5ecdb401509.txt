Okay, so I've got this problem here about markup on stock. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question says: "Find the markup in dollars on $230,000 worth of stock at retail if the cost is 70% of this selling price." Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being asked. Let me break it down. "Markup" is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price, right? So, markup = selling price - cost. But the problem gives the cost as 70% of the selling price. So, cost = 0.7 * selling price. 

But wait, the stock is worth $230,000 at retail. So, does that mean the cost is 70% of that, or the selling price is $230,000? I think I need to clarify that. The wording says, "the cost is 70% of this selling price." Oh, so the cost is 70% of the selling price. So, cost = 0.7 * selling_price.

But the selling price is the retail value, which is $230,000. So, if the cost is 70% of $230,000, then cost = 0.7 * 230,000. Let me compute that.

0.7 times 230,000. Let's see: 200,000 times 0.7 is 140,000, and 30,000 times 0.7 is 21,000. So adding them together, 140,000 + 21,000 = 161,000. Wait, that can't be right because that's the cost. Wait, no, wait. The cost is 70% of the selling price. So if the selling price is $230k, then 70% is the cost. So cost = 0.7 * 230,000 = 161,000. So, cost is $161,000 and selling price is $230,000.

Wait, but the question asks for the markup, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost. So, markup = selling price - cost. So 230,000 - 161,000 equals 69,000. So the markup is $69,000.

Looking back at the options, option D is $69,000. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because sometimes markup is calculated as (selling price - cost)/cost * 100, but the question just asks for the dollar amount. So my initial approach is correct.

Wait, let me think again. The cost is 70% of the selling price. So cost = 0.7 * SP. SP is $230k. So cost = 0.7 * 230k = 161k. So the markup is SP minus cost, which is 230k - 161k = 69k. So the answer is D: $69,000.
</think>

The markup is calculated by subtracting the cost from the selling price. Given that the cost is 70% of the selling price, which is $230,000, the cost is 0.7 * 230,000 = $161,000. The markup is then $230,000 - $161,000 = $69,000. 

Answer: D
