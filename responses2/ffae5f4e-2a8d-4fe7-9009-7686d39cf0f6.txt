Okay, so I've got this question about physics concepts, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about what happens when you bend a tree branch by hanging on its end. The top side of the branch is under what? The options are friction, tension, normal force, etc.

Hmm. Let me visualize the scenario. When you bend a tree branch, it's like twisting it. So the branch is under tension because it's being stretched or twisted. But wait, the branch is a tree, so it's a long, rigid object. When you bend it, it's not just stretching; it's also twisting.

So, bending a branch would involve both tension and torque. Tension is when something is pulled, and torque is when a force causes rotation. But the question is specifically about the forces at play on the top side. 

Wait, the top sideâ€”if you're bending the branch, the top part is probably being pulled from the side. So in terms of forces, the branch is under tension. Because when you hang something, like a rope, it's under tension. The branch would have a tensional force acting on it when it's bent.

Another thought: when you bend something, like a stick, the top end is under tension because of the torque applied. Because the branch is being twisted, each part of it is being pulled along with the twisting motion, creating tension.

Wait, but what about the normal force? The normal force is perpendicular to a surface. If the branch is lying on the ground, the top side would normally have a normal force from the ground. But when you bend it, the normal force might change. Or does bending affect the contact points?

Alternatively, if you hold the branch at the end, bending it would cause the branch to bend away from the point of support. So the top part would be under tension because of the bending. The branch is being pulled from the side, which would cause tension.

So looking at the options: the question is which force is acting on the top side.

Option C is tension. So I think the top side is under tension.

When you bend a tree branch by hanging on its end, the top side of the branch is under tension. This is because the branch is being twisted, which causes each part of it to be pulled along with the twisting motion, resulting in tension. The top side is pulled from the side, creating tensional forces. Other options, such as friction or normal force, do not adequately describe the forces acting on the top side in this scenario.

Answer: C
