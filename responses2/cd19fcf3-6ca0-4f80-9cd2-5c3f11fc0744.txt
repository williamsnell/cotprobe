Okay, so I have this problem about a smart calculator company, and I need to figure out their variable and fixed costs. Let me read the question again.

The company produces 700 calculators and has total costs of $15,700. Then, when they produce 1,000 calculators, the total cost is $16,000. I need to find the variable and fixed costs from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that in cost accounting, total cost is made up of fixed costs plus variable costs. Fixed costs don't change with the level of production, while variable costs change proportionally with production levels.

So, let's think about the two data points given. When they make 700 calculators, the cost is $15,700. When they make 1,000, it's $16,000. 

First, I can calculate the change in total cost and the change in production. The increase in production is 1,000 - 700 = 300 calculators. The increase in total cost is $16,000 - $15,700 = $300.

Wait, so for 300 more calculators, the cost increases by $300. That suggests that each calculator's variable cost is $1, because 300 calculators * $1 per calculator = $300. So variable cost per calculator is $1.

But wait, I should check that. Let me compute the variable cost per calculator from the two points.

The first point: 700 calculators cost $15,700. So variable cost (VC) would be 15,700 /700. Let me calculate that.

15,700 divided by 700. Let's see, 700 *22 is 15,400. 15,700 -15,400 is 300. So that's 300/700, which is 0.42857... So approximately $0.4286 per calculator. 

Wait, but when they produce 1,000, the total cost is $16,000. Variable cost per calculator would be 16,000 /1000 = $16,000 /1000 = $1.60. But that doesn't match the 0.4286 from the first point. That can't be right because fixed costs are the same, so variable should stay the same per unit.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The variable cost per unit should be the same, so when production increases, the variable cost should increase proportionally. So, perhaps the variable cost per calculator is $1. Because when production goes up by 300, variable increases by $300, so 300/300=1 per calculator.

But let's calculate it using the two points. Let's define:

Total cost = Fixed cost + (Variable cost * Number produced)

Letâ€™s denote FC as fixed cost and VC as variable cost per calculator.

So, for 700 calculators: 15,700 = FC + 700 * VC.

For 1000 calculators: 16,000 = FC +1000 * VC.

Now, subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate FC.

(16,000 -15,700) = (FC +1000*VC) - (FC +700*VC)

300 = 300 * VC

So VC = 300 /300 = $1 per calculator.

So, variable cost is $1 per calculator.

Now, plug back into one of the equations to find FC.

Take the first one: 15,700 = FC +700 *1.

FC =15,700 -700 =15,000.

So fixed cost is $15,000.

Wait, looking at the options, option B says variable cost $1 and fixed cost $15,000. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. If variable cost is $1, then 700 calculators would cost FC +700*1 = FC +700. FC is 15,000, so 15,000 +700 =15,700. That matches the first data point. The second data point: 1000 *1 =1000, plus FC=15,000, so 16,000, which matches the second point. So yes, that's correct.

So the variable cost per calculator is $1, fixed cost is $15,000. Looking at the options, that's option B.

The variable cost per calculator is $1, and the fixed cost is $15,000. 

To determine this, we analyze the two data points:

1. **First data point (700 calculators):**  
   Total cost = $15,700  
   Variable cost per calculator = Total cost - Fixed cost  
   However, since fixed cost is the same for both production levels, we can calculate it using the difference in total costs and production levels.

2. **Second data point (1,000 calculators):**  
   Total cost = $16,000  
   Variable cost per calculator = ($16,000 - $15,700) / (1,000 - 700) = $300 / 300 = $1 per calculator.

3. **Calculating Fixed Cost (FC):**  
   Using the first data point:  
   $15,700 = FC + (700 * $1)  
   FC = $15,700 - $700 = $15,000.

4. **Verification:**  
   - **700 calculators:** FC + (700 * $1) = $15,000 + $700 = $15,700.  
   - **1,000 calculators:** FC + (1,000 * $1) = $15,000 + $1,000 = $16,000.  

Thus, the variable cost is $1 per calculator, and the fixed cost is $15,000. The correct answer is **B: Variable cost: $1 per calculator, Fixed cost: $15,000**.
