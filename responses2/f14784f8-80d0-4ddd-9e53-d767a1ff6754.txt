Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about which of the given options is NOT a group. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a group in abstract algebra is a set equipped with an operation that satisfies four fundamental properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses for each element. So, for each option, I need to check if these four properties hold.

The options are:
A: Integers under addition.
B: Positive real numbers under multiplication.
C: Nonzero integers under multiplication.
D: Complex numbers under addition.
E: Nonzero real numbers under multiplication.

Let me go through each one.

Option A: Integers under addition. Hmm, integers are closed under addition, right? Adding two integers gives another integer. Addition is associative. The identity element is 0 since 0 + n = n for any integer n. And every integer n has an inverse, which is -n. So, A is a group. So, not the answer.

Option B: Positive real numbers under multiplication. Positive reals are closed under multiplication. Multiplication is associative. The identity element is 1, since 1 * x = x for any positive real x. Each positive real number x has an inverse, which is 1/x, which is also positive. So, B is a group. Not the answer.

Option C: Nonzero integers under multiplication. Wait, this is multiplication. Let me check the properties. Nonzero integers are closed under multiplication. Multiplication is associative. The identity element here would be 1, since 1 * x = x. Each nonzero integer x has an inverse, which is 1/x, but wait, 1/x might not be an integer unless x is 1 or -1. For example, 2's inverse is 1/2, which is not an integer. So, not every element has an inverse in the set. Therefore, C is not a group. That must be the answer.

Option D: Complex numbers under addition. Complex numbers are closed under addition. Addition is associative. The identity element is 0. Every complex number z has an additive inverse, which is -z. So, D is a group. So, not the answer.

Option E: Nonzero real numbers under multiplication. Nonzero real numbers are closed under multiplication. Multiplication is associative. The identity element is 1. Every nonzero real number x has a multiplicative inverse, which is 1/x, which is also nonzero. So, E is a group. Not the answer.

So the only one that isn't a group is option C.

The correct answer is C: The nonzero integers under multiplication is NOT a group because not every nonzero integer has a multiplicative inverse within the set.

Answer: C
