Question:

Select the single most accurate statement about the absorptive area of the human intestine?


Options:

A: The absorptive area is equivalent to that of a tennis court
B: All of the options given are correct
C: Changes in motility increase the contact time between nutrients and absorptive surface
D: The presence of folds, villi and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes magnifies the absorptive area

Okay, so I've got this question about the absorptive area of the human intestine. Hmm, I remember that the absorptive area refers to the surface area exposed to nutrients. Let me think about the structure of the intestine.

The intestine has enterocytes, which are the small cells. Each enterocyte has a cell surface, right? And on those surfaces, there are things like villi and microvilli. Oh wait, those are structures that increase the surface area, making the absorptive area bigger. Because the absorptive area is the contact between nutrients and the surface. So without those structures, the surface would be too small, right?

Looking at the options:

A: The absorptive area is equivalent to a tennis court. That's a big number—tennis courts are about 240 square meters. But the total absorptive area of the entire intestine is much less. The average person's total surface area is about 1.6 liters, but if the question is about a single cell, maybe it's different. Wait, no, each enterocyte has a certain surface area. Let me think: the average surface area per enterocyte is about 0.15 square centimeters. So if you have about 14 million enterocytes, that would be about 2,100,000 square centimeters, which is 210 square meters. That's way bigger than a tennis court. So A is probably wrong.

B: All options correct. Well, if A is wrong, B can't be correct.

C: Changes in motility increase contact time. Oh, wait, motility refers to movement. If the enterocytes are moving rapidly, maybe they cover more area in the same time. But I don't think the absorptive area is about the movement but the surface area. The contact time would depend on how much time they take to move past the surface. So I'm not sure if C is correct. Maybe it's not about contact time but the surface area itself.

D: Presence of folds, villi, and microvilli magnify the absorptive area. Oh, exactly! The villi and microvilli are the structures that increase the surface area. So D is correct. The folds might cause more coverage if they're densely packed, but the main thing is the villi and microvilli.

So the correct answer should be D.

The absorptive area refers to the surface area of the intestinal cells exposed to nutrients. The correct answer is D: The presence of folds, villi, and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes magnifies the absorptive area. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The total absorptive area of the entire intestine is much larger than a tennis court (even if each enterocyte has a surface area of ~0.15 cm², the total surface area is about 2,100,000 cm², which is ~210 m²).
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as Option A is wrong.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Changes in motility do not directly increase the absorptive area but affect how quickly the surface is covered.
- **Option D**: Correct. The presence of villi and microvilli increases the surface area, as they are specialized structures that enhance nutrient absorption.

ANSWER: D
