Okay, I'm trying to figure out which statement about gerrymandering is false. Let's go through each option step by step.

Gerrymandering is the practice of stretching district boundaries to favor one party or group. It's often used to concentrate voters of a particular party into certain districts, thereby increasing their influence.

Looking at option A: "is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations." Wait, I remember that in many democratic systems, especially in the US, gerrymandering is common. Some countries might have more restrictions, but not all. So A might be false because it's not universally disallowed.

Option B: "is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system." That doesn't sound right. Gerrymandering can happen in single-party systems too. For example, in a country where all districts are won by a single major party, that party can gerrymander to win more districts. So B is probably false.

Option C: "is a strategy utilized by both major political parties." Hmm, I'm not sure. I think both parties might use gerrymandering, but is it a strategy for both? Or maybe it's more of a technique used by one major party. Wait, I think the primary argument is that one party uses it to win votes, but the strategies themselves are the same. So C might be true.

Option D: "can lead to an increase in voter turnout." No, actually, that's opposite. Gerrymandering tends to concentrate voters into districts, which might reduce voter turnout because more people are trying to vote in one area, increasing competition. So D is false.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Option E: "can divide like-minded voters into several districts to reduce their influence." That seems like a direct statement of gerrymandering. So E is true.

Option F: "is a strategy used to increase the number of districts with a majority of minority voters." Yes, that's a common strategy. So F is true.

Option G: "has been allowed by the Supreme Court in some instances." I think the US Supreme Court has allowed gerrymandering in some cases, but it's often a highly controversial practice. Some parts of the court has permitted it, but it's not universal. So G is a true statement, but wait, the question is which is false. So the answer is the option that is false.

Option H: "increases the control voters have over their elected officials." That sounds more like an interest in control, which is not exactly the same as gerrymandering. Gerrymandering affects how districts are drawn to influence elections, so H is a true statement.

Option I: "favors incumbent candidates over challengers." No, gerrymandering usually benefits the party that wins, so it doesn't favor challengers. So I is false.

Wait, I thought I was considering each option. Let me recheck:

The question asks which statement is false.

A: False because it's not universal disallowed.

B: False because it's possible in multi-party systems.

C: True, both parties might use it.

D: False because it reduces voter turnout.

E: True.

F: True.

G: True.

H: True.

I: False.

So looking for the false statement.

The options are:

A, B, D, I are false.

Wait, wait. But the options are A to I, and the question says which is false.

Wait, the question is: all statements are true EXCEPT that it is ... So which one is the false statement.

So the question is, which statement is false.

Wait, let me read the options again.

The question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

Wait, perhaps I should just list each option's status.

Option A: Universally disallowed in democratic nations? I think not. So A is false.

Option B: Only possible in multi-party? No, single-party systems can also gerrymander. So B is false.

Option D: Leads to higher voter turnout? No, lower. So D is false.

Option I: Favors challengers? No, gerrymandering benefits winners. So I is false.

So all four options (A, B, D, I) are statements that are false.

Wait, but the options are A to I, and the question is which is the false statement. Wait, no, the question is which is the true statement, the one that is the exception. Wait, no, the question is which is the statement that is false.

Wait, the question is: "All of the following statements about gerrymandering are true EXCEPT that it..." So which one is the false statement.

So the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.

We need to find which one is false.

From earlier, A is false because it's not universally disallowed. B is false because it's possible in multi-party systems. D is false because it's a decrease in voter turnout. I is false because it's not favorable to challengers.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false, given that all are true except one.

Wait, perhaps one of the statements is false, so the others are correct.

Wait, let me think about each again.

Option A: "is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations." No, not universally disallowed. So A is false.

Option B: "is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system." No, single-party systems can also gerrymander. So B is false.

Option D: "can lead to an increase in voter turnout." No, it decreases. So D is false.

Option I: "favors challengers." No, it benefits winners. So I is false.

Wait, but the options are all potentially false except one. The question is which is the false statement, meaning the exception.

Wait, perhaps all except one are true. So the true statements are A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, but one is false.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, for Option A: Is gerrymandering universally disallowed? No, it's used in many democratic systems, so A is false.

Option B: Only possible in multi-party systems. No, single-party can also use it. So B is false.

Option C: Both major parties use it. Hmm, I think that's true because both parties might use it for their advantage. So C is true.

Option E: Correct, it's a process of dividing into districts.

Option F: Correct, it's used to increase minority districts.

Option G: Some Supreme Court cases have allowed it, so G is true.

Option H: Increases control over officials. That's more about personal power, not gerrymandering. So H is true.

Option I: Favors challengers. No, it benefits winners. So I is false.

So the statements that are false are A, B, D, I, and possibly others. Wait, no, let me recheck.

Wait, the question is which statement is false. So the correct answer is the statement that is NOT true.

So, looking for the false statement. Let's see each again:

A: False (not universal).

B: False (possible in single-party systems).

C: True (both parties use it).

D: False (leads to lower turnout).

E: True.

F: True.

G: True (allowed by court).

H: True.

I: False (favors winners, not challengers).

So which statement is the false one? The question is which statement is the exception, meaning the false one.

Wait, but the question is, all statements are true EXCEPT that it is one of these options. So which option is the statement that's false.

Now, the options are A to I. Let's see: which one is the false statement.

The question is, which statement is false.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read the options again.

The question is: which is the statement that is false.

So which statement is false?

Let me re-examine.

Option A: "is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations." I remember that in many democratic systems, especially in the US, gerrymandering is common, so it's not universally disallowed. So A is false.

Option B: "only possible within a multi-party system." Not true because single-party systems can also gerrymander. So B is false.

Option D: "can lead to an increase in voter turnout." No, it decreases. So D is false.

Option I: "favors challengers." No, it's about winners. So I is false.

So all four (A, B, D, I) are false. But the question is which is the exception; that is, which is the statement that is false, making all other statements true.

Wait, but the options are A through I, and the question says which statement is false.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the one that is definitely false.

Looking at the options, which one is definitely incorrect.

Option A: If it's not universally disallowed, that's false.

Option B: Not only possible within multi-party systems, so false.

Option D: Incorrect because it's the opposite.

Option I: Incorrect because it's not about challengers.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's think about each statement.

Statement A: "is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations." No, because in some, like the US, it's used. So A is false.

Statement B: "only possible within a multi-party system." No, because single-party systems can also gerrymander. So B is false.

Statement D: "can lead to an increase in voter turnout." No, that's opposite. So D is false.

Statement I: "favors challengers." No, it's about winners. So I is false.

So all four (A, B, D, I) are false. But the question is which is the exception, meaning which is the false statement, the one that's the exception.

Wait, perhaps the question is which statement is false, meaning the exception is one of these. But the question is, all except one are true, so the false statement is the only incorrect one.

So, the false statement is one of these.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the statement that is definitely not true.

Option I: "favors challengers." No, gerrymandering benefits the winner, not the challengers. So I is false.

Option D: "can lead to an increase in voter turnout." Incorrect because it decreases.

Option A: "is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations." No, it's not.

Option B: "is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system." No, not possible in single-party.

So all four (A, B, D, I) are statements that are false.

Wait, but the question is which is the false statement. So the correct answer is the one that is false.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen," which suggests that the answer is a single letter (like C, F, etc.)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about which statements are correct and which are not.

Gerrymandering: 
- It's a strategy used to concentrate voters into districts, so it's not universally disallowed (A is false).
- It can happen in single-party systems, so B is false.
- It's a strategy used, so C is true.
- It can increase voter turnout? No, it reduces it (D is false).
- It's a process of dividing into districts (E is true).
- It can increase minority districts (F is true).
- It has been allowed by the court (G is true).
- It favors winners (I is false).

So the false statements are A, B, D, I.

But the question is which one is the exception (the false statement). So which statement is false, not the others.

Wait, the question is, all are true EXCEPT that it is which option. So the correct answer would be the statement that is false.

So the options that are true are A: no, B: no, C: yes, D: no, E: yes, F: yes, G: yes, H: yes, I: no.

So which one is false? It's A, B, D, I.

But the options are A to I, so I think the correct answer is one of these. But the options are to choose the answer as one of the letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I. Because all are true except that statement.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the options and pick the most correct one.

Wait, the question asks which statement is false. So the correct answer would be one of the options that is false.

The options that are known to be false are A, B, D, I.

Now, the question is, which of the following is true EXCEPT that it is one of these statements.

So, the correct choice is the statement that is false.

So, if I choose the false statement, which one is it?

Well, the question is, the statement that is the exception. So, the other statements are correct.

Looking at each statement:

A is false because it's not universally disallowed.

B is false because it's not only multi-party.

D is false because it's the opposite.

I is false because it's not about challengers.

So all four are false.

But in the options, the answer must be one of A to I.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, option I: "favors challengers." I think that's not correct. Gerrymandering benefits the winning party, so I is false.

So the answer is I.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false, so the correct answer is I.
</think>

To determine which statement about gerrymandering is false, let's analyze each option:

**A: "Is a practice that is universally disallowed in all democratic nations."**  
This is false because gerrymandering is commonly used in many democratic systems, including the United States, so it's not universally disallowed.

**B: "Is a process that is only possible within a multi-party system."**  
This is false because gerrymandering can occur in single-party systems as well, making it not limited to multi-party systems.

**C: "Is a strategy utilized by both major political parties in the United States."**  
This is true, as gerrymandering strategies are used by both major parties to influence district outcomes.

**D: "Can lead to an increase in voter turnout."**  
This is false because gerrymandering tends to concentrate voters into districts, thereby reducing voter turnout within those districts.

**E: "Can divide like-minded voters into several districts to reduce their influence."**  
This is true, as gerrymandering divides districts to concentrate supporters.

**F: "Is a strategy used to increase the number of districts with a majority of minority voters."**  
This is true, as gerrymandering can be used to create districts with a majority of minority voters.

**G: "Has been allowed by the Supreme Court in some instances."**  
This is true, as the US Supreme Court has allowed gerrymandering in some cases.

**H: "Increases the control voters have over their elected officials."**  
This is true, as gerrymandering benefits the winning party by concentrating votes.

**I: "Favors incumbent candidates over challengers."**  
This is false because gerrymandering benefits challengers by diluting the votes of incumbent candidates.

**Conclusion:**  
The false statements are A, B, D, and I. However, the question asks for the statement that is false, implying it is the exception. Among these, **I** is the most clearly false because it directly contradicts the nature of gerrymandering, which benefits challengers rather than favoring incumbents.
