Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. Hmm, the problem is about a crate sliding across a slick parking lot with a displacement, and a wind is pushing against it. I need to find the change in kinetic energy.

Wait, the displacement vector is given as d = (-3.0 m) i. So displacement is in the negative x-direction. The force applied by the wind is F = (2.0 N)i + (-6.0 N)j. Oh, and the initial kinetic energy is 10 J. The question is about the kinetic energy at the end of displacement d.

I remember that when work is done on an object, it changes its kinetic energy. The work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy (ΔKE). The formula is ΔKE = W, where W is the work done.

So I need to calculate the work done by the wind on the crate. The work done by a force is the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector. So W = F · d.

But wait, what's the direction of the displacement and the force? The displacement vector is (-3.0 m) i, so direction is along the negative x-axis. The force is (2.0 N)i + (-6.0 N)j, so the force has components along x and y.

The displacement vector d is along the i-axis, so j component is zero. So the displacement is entirely in the x-direction. Let's compute the dot product.

Dot product F · d = F_x * d_x + F_y * d_y. But since d has no j component, only F_x * d_x matters. So F_x is 2.0 N, d_x is -3.0 m. So W = 2.0 * (-3.0) = -6.0 J.

Wait, so the work done is -6 J. But wait, that can't be right. Because the question is about the change in kinetic energy, and work done is equal to the change in KE. So ΔKE = W = -6 J? But that would mean KE goes down to 4 J, which isn't an option here. Oh wait, the initial KE is 10 J, so 10 -6 =4 J. Hmm, but 4 J isn't one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the direction. Let me think again. The displacement vector is (-3.0 m) i, so it's in the negative x-direction, which is the same direction as the force's x-component. Because the force's x-component is 2 N, which is positive. So the force is pushing in the direction opposite to the displacement? Because displacement is negative, and force is positive x.

Wait, but wait, the dot product is F · d. Since d is (-3,0), and F is (2,-6), the dot product is 2*(-3) + (-6)*0 = -6. So W is -6 J. So the work done on the crate is -6 J. That means the crate is losing kinetic energy.

So the initial KE is 10 J, so final KE is 10 -6 =4 J. But wait, looking at the options, option J is 4.0 J, which would be the answer. But wait, are the options correct? Let me check the options again.

Looking back: options are A to J. The options are A:10, B:8, C:14, D:0, E:2, F:6, G:18, H:12, I:16, J:4.

So J is 4. So why is 4 not matching the options? Because I think I made a mistake. Wait, maybe I'm considering the wrong force. Let me recheck.

The wind is pushing against the crate. So the force is in the negative j direction, but the displacement is in the negative i. So the force is (2, -6), displacement is (-3, 0). The dot product is (2)*(-3) + (-6)(0) = -6. So the work is -6 J. So the kinetic energy goes down by 6 J.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the crate is sliding across a slick, oily lot. But the force is from the wind, which is pushing against it. So the force is opposite to displacement. So the work is negative. So the KE is reduced.

But let's think about the direction of the force. The displacement is in the negative x direction, and the force is 2i -6j, which is in the first quadrant. So the force has x component positive, y component negative.

So the force is in the upper left (if origin is origin) direction. The displacement is along the negative x. So the angle between F and d is such that the work is F*d*cos(theta). So the work would be positive if the angle is less than 90 degrees, negative if greater.

Wait, F is in i direction, displacement is in -i direction. So the angle between F and d is 180 degrees. So cos(theta) is -1. So W= F*d * cos(180) = (2)(-3) * (-1) = 6 J. Wait wait, that's conflicting with the earlier calculation. Hmm, what's going on here.

Wait, the displacement vector is (-3,0), and the force is (2, -6). So the angle between the force and the displacement vectors is 180 degrees because vectors are in opposite directions. So the work is F*d cos(theta). So (2)(-3) * cos(180) = 2*(-3)*(-1) = 6 J.

Wait, but wait! That contradicts my earlier calculation. So which is correct? Let me compute again.

Wait, F · d = (2)(-3) + (−6)(0) = -6.

But F · d = |F||d| cos(theta). |F| is sqrt(2^2 + (-6)^2) = sqrt(4+36) = sqrt(40) ≈ 6.324.

|d|=3.

So F · d = 6.324 *3 * cos(theta).

But F · d is -6. So:

6.324 *3 * cos(theta) = -6 → 18.972 * cos(theta) = -6 → cos(theta) = -6/18.972 ≈ -0.316.

So theta ≈ 108 degrees.

Wait, but the angle between F and d is 180 degrees, but according to the calculation, cos(theta) is negative. So that suggests that the angle is more than 90 degrees. Hmm, but 180 is exactly 180, but with a negative cosine, it's the cases where the vectors are in opposite directions but with some angle less than 180.

Wait, no, if the vectors are in opposite directions, the angle should be 180 degrees. But the calculation shows a negative cosine. That suggests that the angle is between 90 and 180. So maybe the vectors are not exactly opposite. So perhaps the displacement is in the negative x, and the force is in the positive x and negative y.

Wait, but the displacement is along negative x, and the force is along positive x and negative y. So the angle between F and d is 180 degrees, but the dot product is negative. So that's a contradiction. Because if the angle is 180 degrees, the cosine should be -1.

Wait, so why is the dot product negative? Because F · d is negative, which would imply that the angle between F and d is greater than 90 degrees.

Wait, let's think about the vectors. F is (2, -6). d is (-3, 0).

The angle between them: the dot product is (2)(-3) + (-6)(0) = -6.

The magnitude of F is sqrt( (2)^2 + (-6)^2 ) = sqrt(4+36)=sqrt(40)=6.3246.

The magnitude of d is 3.

So F·d = |F||d| cos(theta) → -6 = 6.3246 * 3 * cos(theta)

→ cos(theta) = (-6)/(18.9738) → approximately -0.316.

So theta = arccos(-0.316) ≈ 108.43 degrees.

So the angle is about 108 degrees, which is more than 90, so the vectors are not exactly opposite. So the calculation is correct. So the work done is -6 J.

So the change in kinetic energy is -6 J. So initial KE is 10 J, final is 10 -6 =4 J.

But looking at the options, J is 4.0 J, which is one of the choices.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the kinetic energy is 10 J at the beginning, and the situation is a displacement. So work done is -6 J, which would mean the KE decreases by 6 J. So 10-6=4 J.

But wait, the options have J as 4.0 J, which is option J. However, the options don't have J as correct? Because the options given are A to J. Let me check the question again. Oh wait the user wrote the options as A to J, but the options themselves are written as A:10, B:8, etc. Wait, no, the user's given options are:

A:10, B:8, C:14, D:0, E:2, F:6, G:18, H:12, I:16, J:4.

So J is 4. So the correct answer must be J:4.0 J.

Wait, but the initial thinking I thought the answer was 4 J. But why the options are given? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait! The displacement is (-3.0 m)i, and the force is (2.0 N)i + (-6.0 N)j.

Wait, perhaps the work done is not just the product of F and d, but also considering the direction. Wait, no, the formula is correct. The work done is the dot product of F and displacement vectors, which was -6 J.

So KE_initial is 10 J. So KE_final is 10 + (-6) =4 J.

So the correct answer is J:4.0 J.

To determine the change in kinetic energy of the crate, we use the work-energy principle, where the work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy:

\[
\Delta KE = W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d}
\]

The displacement vector is \(\vec{d} = (-3.0 \, \mathrm{m}) \hat{\mathrm{i}}\), and the force vector is \(\vec{F} = (2.0 \, \mathrm{N}) \hat{\mathrm{i}} + (-6.0 \, \mathrm{N}) \hat{\mathrm{j}}\). The dot product is computed as:

\[
\vec{F} \cdot \vec{d} = (2.0)(-3.0) + (-6.0)(0) = -6.0 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Thus, the work done is \(-6.0 \, \mathrm{J}\), which means the crate loses 6 J of kinetic energy. The initial kinetic energy is given as \(10.0 \, \mathrm{J}\), so the final kinetic energy is:

\[
KE_{\text{final}} = KE_{\text{initial}} + \Delta KE = 10.0 + (-6.0) = 4.0 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 4.0 J**
