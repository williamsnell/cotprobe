Question:

Okay, so I've got this finance problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The company invested in a new machine. It will generate $35,000 annually for seven years. They have annual operating expenses of $7,000. But wait, the depreciation expense is included in those operating expenses, and it's $4,000 per year. The payback period is expected to be 5.2 years. The question is asking what amount the company paid for the new machine, and there are multiple-choice options.

Hmm. Payback period is the time it takes for the initial investment to be recovered from the net cash inflows. So, to calculate the payback period, I think I need to consider the annual net cash flow.

Let me structure this.

First, the annual revenues are $35,000. Operating expenses include depreciation of $4,000. So the operating expenses are $4,000. But wait, the problem says the operating expenses are $7,000 in total. Oh wait, no, the question says that the depreciation expense is included in the operating expenses. So, perhaps I should break it down.

Wait, perhaps another way: The company has to pay $7,000 in operating expenses each year. Of that, $4,000 is depreciation. Oh, so the total cash outflow per year is the depreciation plus the operating expenses. Or is it that the operating expenses include depreciation? Hmm, the wording says "Depreciation expense, included in the operating expenses, is $4,000 per year." So in other words, the operating expenses are $7,000, with $4,000 of that being depreciation. So the cash outflow each year is $7,000 operating expenses. But wait, the depreciation is a non-cash expense. So when calculating cash flow, we add back depreciation.

So the cash flow each year is: revenue minus operating expenses (including depreciation as part of expenses) plus depreciation (since it's a non-cash expense that reduces net income but doesn't take cash).

Wait, maybe I should think about the cash flow as:

Cash flow = Revenue - Operating Expenses (which includes depreciation) + Depreciation.

So that would be: 35,000 -7,000 +4,000 = 35,000 -3,000 = 32,000 per year.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Because if operating expenses include depreciation, then the depreciation is part of that. So when calculating cash flows, the depreciation is a non-cash expense that reduces net income but doesn't affect cash. So the cash flow from operations would be revenue minus operating expenses (excluding depreciation) plus depreciation.

So, if the company is generating revenue of $35k, and the operating expenses are $7k (including depreciation), then the cash flow is: 35,000 -7,000 = 28,000, plus depreciation of 4,000. So total cash flow is 32,000 per year.

Wait, no, I think that's correct. Let me re-express this:

The company has revenue of 35k, but they have to pay $7k in operating expenses. Of that $7k, $4k is depreciation. So the cash outflow is 7,000, but the depreciation is a non-cash expense. So in terms of cash flow, the operating expenses are 7,000, but the depreciation is a non-cash item that reduces net income but doesn't affect cash. So the net cash flow from operations is 35,000 (revenue) minus 7,000 (operating expenses) plus 4,000 (recovered from depreciation). Wait, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The cash flow from operations would be:

Revenue - operating expenses + depreciation.

Because the operating expenses include the depreciation. So if in a year, the company has revenue of $35k, pays $7k in operating expenses (which includes $4k in depreciation), then the cash flow from operations is:

35,000 (revenue) -7,000 (total operating expenses) +4,000 (recovery of depreciation) = 32,000.

So each year, the company generates $32,000 in cash flow from operations.

But wait, is that right? Because in accounting, the operating expenses include depreciation. So when calculating cash flow, we have to add back the depreciation because it's a non-cash expense. So the formula is:

Cash Flow = (Revenue - Operating Expenses) + Depreciation.

So yes, that's 35k -7k = 28k. Plus 4k, total 32k. So each year the company is generating $32,000 in cash flow.

Now, the payback period is the time it takes to recover the initial investment. The payback period is given as 5.2 years.

Payback period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow.

So, 5.2 = Initial Investment / 32,000.

So initial investment = 5.2 *32,000.

Calculating that: 5 *32,000 = 160,000. 0.2 *32,000=6,400. So total is 166,400.

Looking at the options, option C is $166,400. So that's the answer.

To determine the amount paid for the new machine, we calculate the initial investment using the payback period formula. The payback period is the time required to recover the initial investment from the net cash inflows. 

1. **Annual Cash Flow Calculation**:  
   - Revenue per year: $35,000  
   - Operating expenses (excluding depreciation): $7,000  
   - Depreciation expense: $4,000 (non-cash expense)  
   - Cash flow = Revenue - Operating Expenses + Depreciation  
   - Cash flow = $35,000 - $7,000 + $4,000 = $32,000 per year.

2. **Initial Investment Calculation**:  
   - Payback period = 5.2 years  
   - Annual Cash Flow = $32,000  
   - Initial Investment = Payback period × Annual Cash Flow  
   - Initial Investment = 5.2 × $32,000 = $166,400.

3. **Answer Selection**:  
   - Option C: $166,400.
