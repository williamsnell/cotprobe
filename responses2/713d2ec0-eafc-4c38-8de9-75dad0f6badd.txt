Double fertilization is a unique feature of flowering plants. In this process, one sperm unites with the egg to yield a zygote. The second sperm unites with the polar nuclei to initiate the formation of the

Okay, so I have this question about the process of double fertilization in flowering plants. Hmm, I remember that during this process, the zygote is formed from a sperm and an egg, and then the second sperm attaches to the polar nuclei. But wait, the question is about the next step. So after the second sperm attaches, what happens next?

Wait, the options are about different parts of the plant. Let me think. I think in double fertilization, the second sperm attaches to the polar nuclei, and that creates a new zygote. Then this second zygote undergoes gametogenesis. That's where gametes develop. But what happens after that?

Oh right, I remember that after the second zygote forms, it leads to the formation of an embryo. So the embryo would be the result of this process. So looking at the options, option B is the embryo. Alternatively, some might confuse it with the microgametophyte, but that's a different stage.

Wait, what's the structure after double fertilization? The first zygote (from sperm and egg) is the diploid, and then the second zygote (from the second sperm and the polar nuclei) is the haploid, which becomes the embryo. So the embryo is the offspring of the diploid and haploid cells. So the correct answer should be B: embryo.

The process of double fertilization involves the formation of a zygote from the union of a sperm and an egg, followed by the second sperm attaching to the polar nuclei. This second zygote undergoes gametogenesis, leading to the development of an embryo. Among the options, the correct answer is the embryo, as it represents the offspring formed after this process.

Answer: B
