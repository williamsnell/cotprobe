Question:

On June 1, an appliance manufacturer telephoned a supplier to determine whether the supplier could provide 300 washing machine motors of a particular model by October 1. The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, "Deal." The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, "I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order." The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer had not received any orders for the machines with the specified motors at the time of the supplier's refusal.
B: No, because the manufacturer's representative verbally agreed to the deal over the phone.
C: No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.
D: Yes, because the supplier was no longer carrying the model of the motor at the time of the call.
E: Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.
F: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.
G: No, because the manufacturer's representative sent the note on company letterhead.
H: No, because the supplier did not inform the manufacturer about not being able to supply the motors in time.
I: Yes, because the supplier never agreed to the contract in writing.
J: No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the supplier's statute of frauds defense applies here. So, let me go through the scenario step by step.

The manufacturer called a supplier on June 1 to check if they could provide 300 motors by October 1. The supplier offered it at $300 each, totaling $90,000. The rep said "Deal," so I guess they agreed.

The next day, the rep sent an unsigned company letter, saying they're happy to supply and that they'll call back soon. Then the rep sent out catalogs to regular customers announcing washing machines with those motors. The manufacturer didn't hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier said they couldn't provide the motors because they were no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had no orders for the machines with the motors.

The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Now, the question is whether this defense would succeed.

First, I should recall what the statute of frauds requires. The statute of frauds (also known as the supply contract statute) requires that the supplier notify the manufacturer of the quantity of goods to be delivered, either by writing or by providing a witness. It doesn't require the supplier to have all the details upfront or to have a chain of distribution.

In this case, the supplier sent a note on company letterhead on July 1. The note didn't include a quantity term. The manufacturer's note was company letterhead, and if the supplier received it before refusing, it would have to have a notice that included the quantity. But if the company letterhead wasn't delivered (like a note sent to the company letterhead), then the supplier might not have had any written notice of the quantity to send.

Wait, but the company letterhead might be delivered, but if the delivery was to the company letterhead, the supplier might not have a written order yet. Alternatively, the company letterhead could be delivered, but the quantity isn't specified, so maybe the supplier didn't know how many motors were needed. Alternatively, maybe the supplier sent a letter or a note that didn't include the quantity, which could be a problem.

Wait, in the scenario, the company letterhead was sent by the manufacturer. If the supplier hasn't delivered the letterhead yet, but the letterhead was sent to the company, that might not be enough. The supplier's note on company letterhead might not have stated the quantity, so perhaps the supplier didn't have a written contract with the manufacturer for the quantity of 300 motors.

But wait, the statute of frauds requires that the supplier notify the manufacturer in writing or by providing a witness. If the supplier didn't send any written order (like a letter stating the quantity), then the statute of frauds wouldn't apply because the supplier hasn't given a written notice.

So, looking at the options, option E says the supplier never agreed to the contract in writing. That's interesting. The supplier did send a note, but it didn't include the quantity. So if the supplier didn't agree to the contract in writing, they might not be bound by the statute of frauds.

Wait, but the statute of frauds requires that the supplier notify the manufacturer in writing. If the supplier sent a letter but didn't agree to the contract in writing, then they might not be obligated to issue a written contract. So, the supplier's defense might not succeed.

Alternatively, if the supplier sent the note but didn't agree to the contract in writing, then the statute of frauds doesn't apply. Because the supplier hasn't given a written contract, so the statute doesn't require them to have a written notice.

So, the key point here is whether the supplier provided a written contract. In this case, they sent a note on company letterhead, but didn't agree to the deal in writing. So they didn't bind the manufacturer by giving a written contract. Therefore, the statute of frauds doesn't apply because the contract was not in writing.

Alternatively, the statute of frauds requires that the supplier notify the manufacturer (either by writing or by providing a witness). If the supplier didn't send any written notice, the statute doesn't apply. So, the supplier's defense here would probably not succeed because they didn't issue a written contract.

Looking at the options:

A: Yes, because manufacturer had no orders. But that's about the supplier's failure to act, not about the statute. Also, the statute applies if the supplier didn't warn.

B: No, because rep verbally agreed. The rep verbally agreed, but that doesn't mean the statute applies. Statute of frauds is about notification, not verbal agreement.

C: No, because supplier failed to object. The supplier refused later. But the statute of frauds is about notification, not about refusing later.

D: Yes, because no signature. The note didn't have a signature, but that doesn't mean they didn't agree to the contract. The note was on letterhead, which doesn't imply a written agreement.

E: Yes, because never agreed in writing. If the supplier didn't agree in writing, then the statute doesn't apply. So, if the supplier sent a letter but didn't agree to the contract, then the statute of frauds doesn't require the supplier to be bound by a written contract. So, their defense would be that the statute of frauds doesn't apply.

Wait, but option E says "Yes, because the supplier never agreed to the contract in writing." So, if they never agreed in writing, then the statute doesn't apply, so the defense is successful.

Alternatively, the statute of frauds requires that the supplier notify the manufacturer in writing. If the supplier sent the note but didn't agree to the contract (in writing), then the statute doesn't apply.

So, the answer would be E, because the supplier never agreed to the contract in writing, so the statute of frauds doesn't require a written contract.

Wait, but let me think again. The statute of frauds is about whether the supplier is notifying the manufacturer. So, the supplier didn't sign a contract but sent a letter. If the letter was delivered but didn't contain a notice, is that a problem?

Oh, wait, the note didn't include a quantity. So, the supplier sent a letter but didn't include the quantity. In that case, the manufacturer might not have been aware of the quantity. But the statute of frauds requires the supplier to have a written contract. If the supplier sent a letter without a notice, then the statute doesn't apply because the contract was not in writing.

In this case, the supplier sent a letter but didn't agree to the contract in writing. So, the statute of frauds doesn't require a written contract. Therefore, the defense (statute of frauds) would succeed because the supplier didn't issue a written contract.

Alternatively, the note didn't include the quantity, but that's about the contract's content. The note doesn't state the quantity, so perhaps the supplier didn't have a written contract to inform the manufacturer about the quantity. Hence, the statute of frauds doesn't apply.

So, looking at the options, option E says "Yes, because the supplier never agreed to the contract in writing." That would fit because if the supplier didn't agree to the contract in writing, then the statute doesn't require them to be notified in writing, so the defense is successful.

The supplier's defense against the breach of contract under the statute of frauds hinges on whether the supplier provided a written notice of the quantity to be delivered. The scenario details are as follows:

1. **Supplier's Actions**: The supplier sent a note on company letterhead (July 1) but did not include a quantity term. The note did not contain a signature, indicating agreement to the contract. However, the absence of a written contract requirement means that the supplier's failure to provide a written notice would not automatically succeed.

2. **Statute of Frauds**: The statute of frauds requires that the supplier notify the manufacturer in writing or by providing a witness. If the supplier did not issue a written notification, the statute of frauds does not require them to have such notice. In this case, the supplier sent a letter without a written agreement, which means they did not provide a written contract.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option E**: Correct. The supplier never agreed to the contract in writing, so the statute of frauds does not require a written contract, making the defense successful.
