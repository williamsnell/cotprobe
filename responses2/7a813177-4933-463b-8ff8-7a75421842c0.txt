Question:

A lumber mill contracted to deliver one thousand8-foot sheets of plywood to a home improvement store on the first of each month for 10 consecutive months starting June 1. The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?

Options:

A: Judgment for the store, because the mill failed to have a contingency plan in place.
B: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.
C: Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.
D: Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.
E: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.
F: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.
G: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.
H: Judgment for the store, because the mill had a contractual obligation to deliver the goods.
I: Judgment for the mill, because they had informed the store about the issue in advance.
J: Judgment for the store, because the mill could have sourced lumber from another location.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about contract law, specifically dealing with performance obligations and contract breaches. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The scenario is a lumber mill that contracted to deliver 10,000-foot sheets of plywood every month for the first 10 months starting June. So that's from June 1 to May 31? Wait, no, because the delivery is monthly starting June 1. So the first delivery is June 1, then July 1, August 1, etc. So the last delivery would be May 31? Wait, no—wait, the contract is for 10 consecutive months starting June 1. So June 1 to May 31? That's 10 months. So the first month is June, but wait: June 1 to June 30 is one month, July 1 to July 31 is the second, up to May 31 as the 10th month. So the last delivery is May 31, right?

Wait, the problem says that on June 1, July 1, and August 1, the shipments were delivered on time and paid for. Then on August 16, the mill can't meet the September delivery because their reserve was destroyed. The store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded the remaining shipments to be delivered on time. When September didn't arrive, the store sued for breach of contract.

The question is how the court would hold, choosing between options A to J.

I remember that the key issue is whether the contract was performance contingent or performance obligations were excused. Let's break down the facts.

The mill contracted for 10 months, starting June 1. So the last delivery is May 31. But then, August 16, they can't deliver September 1. The store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance, but the store refused. So the store is suing for breach of contract.

Wait, so the mill was supposed to deliver the September 1 shipment on time, but because of a forest fire, their reserve was destroyed. The mill had a contingency plan? Wait, no. The contingency plan was their reserve being destroyed by a forest fire. Or wait, was the mill aware of that?

Wait, the problem says, "the mill would not be able to meet the September delivery date because their lumber reserve had been destroyed..." So the mill's own reserve was destroyed, not the store's. So the mill had a contingency, but perhaps the store didn't realize it.

So if the mill's performance relied on a contingency that was actually caused, does that affect the obligations?

Wait, the scenario: the mill delivered the first three months on time. Then August 16, the mill can't deliver September. The store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance. So the store refused, but the store's decision was to demand the remaining shipments to be delivered on time. So the store is suing for breach of contract.

I think the question boils down to whether the contract was performance contingent, and if the performance was excused or not. If the performance was dependent on a contingency that the mill knew about or could have anticipated, then the store's excuse might not be valid.

Wait, the store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. But the problem doesn't state whether the mill was aware of the forest fire. It just says that the reserve was destroyed, causing the mill to not meet that delivery date. So the mill's failure to meet the September delivery date was because of an unforeseen event— forest fire. So the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that was caused, but perhaps the mill didn't know about it.

Wait, but the store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. So if the mill had a plan, but the contingency itself was an unforeseen event, then perhaps the store's excuse was invalid.

Wait, no. Because the store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. If the plan was about delivering the September shipment, and the plan was that they'd have to make it up, but because of the fire, they can't. So perhaps the store's excuse is that they can excuse the mill from further performance because the mill had a contingency plan. But if the cause of the problem was an unforeseen event (the fire), then the store's excuse might not be valid.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall the concept of performance obligations being performance contracts. Performance obligations are performance contingent if the performance is dependent on a contingency that the seller is aware of or can reasonably foresee.

In this case, the seller (mill) had a contingency plan, but the problem says the problem was an unforeseen event (the forest fire). So perhaps the mill didn't realize or know about it.

Wait, but the mill's performance was dependent on whether they had enough lumber, which was destroyed. So if the mill knew about the fire and had contingency plans, then the store's excuse would be acceptable. But if the mill's performance relied on a contingency that was beyond their control, then the store's excuse might not be valid.

Wait, but the problem says, "they would not be able to meet the September delivery date because their lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire." So the mill's failure was due to the fire. The mill's performance depended on their reserve, which was destroyed. So perhaps the issue is whether the mill knew about this.

Wait, the problem doesn't say the mill knew about the forest fire. It just says that the reserve was destroyed. So the mill's performance relied on a contingency that was an unforeseen event (the fire). Therefore, if the mill knew about the contingency, their performance would have been performance contingent, and the store's excuse would be excused.

But if the mill's performance was contingent on a contingency that was beyond their control, then the store's excuse might not be admitted.

Wait, but the store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. So if the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that the mill knew about (like not being destroyed), then the store's excuse could be excused. But in this case, the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that was an unforeseen event.

Alternatively, perhaps the mill knew about it but didn't know how to handle it, and had a contingency plan.

Wait, let me think again. The store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. If the mill had a contingency plan, then the store's excuse would be valid. But if the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that the mill knew about but couldn't handle, then the store's excuse might not be valid.

Wait, but the problem states that the mill's performance was dependent on the reserve, which was destroyed. So maybe the mill had no control over that, and the performance was performance contingent.

So, the mill's performance was contingent on the reserve being available. But the mill didn't know about the fire, and the fire was unexpected. So the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that was beyond their control.

In such a case, can the store's excuse to excuse the mill from further performance be valid? I think that if the performance was dependent on a contingency that the seller knew about, then the seller could excuse the buyer from further performance. But if the seller didn't know about the contingency, then the seller couldn't excuse the buyer regardless of whether the contingency was known.

Wait, but in this scenario, the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that the mill knew about (the fire destroyed the reserve). So the mill, knowing that the fire would destroy it, had a contingency plan. So the store's excuse would be valid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the store's excuse was that the mill couldn't meet September delivery because of the fire. So if the mill knew about the fire, then the store's excuse is valid. Because the seller (mill) knew about the contingency, so the buyer (store) can excuse the seller from further performance.

But in this case, the store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. So was the store's excuse that the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that the mill knew about, but the store could excuse the mill from further performance because the mill had a contingency plan.

But the question is whether the mill's performance was performance contingent. Because if it was, then the store's excuse would be valid. If it wasn't, then the store's excuse would be invalid, and the buyer would have to fulfill the obligations.

Wait, but the store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. So if the mill knew about the contingency (the fire), then the store's excuse would be valid.

So the question boils down to whether the mill's performance was performance contingent.

Wait, performance contingency occurs when the performance is dependent on a specific condition, such as the availability of a certain amount of goods (e.g., lumber), which is beyond the seller's control. In this case, the seller (mill) contracted for 10,000-foot sheets and had to deliver them on time. The problem is that in August, on August 16, they couldn't deliver September 1 because their reserve was destroyed. The store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance.

So the mill's performance was dependent on their reserve. The store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan (which was that they can't meet the September delivery date because of the fire, which would affect their reserve). But wait, the problem says the mill's performance was dependent on the reserve being available, which was destroyed because of the forest fire.

Wait, but the store's excuse was that the mill could excuse from further performance because the mill had a contingency plan. So the store's excuse is that they can stop the mill from meeting the September delivery.

But in this case, the store refused, and the store sued for breach of contract. So the store has to prove that the mill's performance was such that the store's performance was not valid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the options.

Option A: Judgment for the store because the mill failed to have a contingency plan. So if the mill didn't have a contingency, then the store's excuse was invalid, and the mill must fulfill the obligations.

Option B: The mill's performance would be discharged by impossibility. So if the mill couldn't perform because it couldn't meet the September delivery, then it was a performance impossibility.

Option C: The mill should have foreseen the fire and had a contingency plan, so the store's excuse is valid.

Option D: The mill's performance would be excused because they had a contractual duty.

Option E: The store's demand would be met by frustration of purpose.

Option F: The mill is responsible because they're not responsible.

Option G: The forest fire is God's action.

Option H: The mill had a duty, so the store was excused.

Option I: The mill knew about the problem and could source elsewhere.

Option J: The mill could have sourced elsewhere.

Wait, the law here is about performance obligations being performance contingent and whether the seller knew about a contingency causing the performance.

In this case, the seller (mill) had a performance obligation for the September shipment. They had a contingency plan because they knew that their reserve was destroyed by the fire. So the store's excuse was that the mill knew about the fire and had a contingency plan. So the store's excuse would be valid, and the seller can excuse the buyer from further performance.

But wait, the store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan, but the problem is that the question is whether the store's excuse is valid. So in this case, the mill knew about the contingency (the fire). So the store's excuse is valid.

Wait, but the store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. So if the mill knew about the issue and had a contingency, the store's excuse is valid. So the mill can excuse the store from further performance.

But then, if the mill is excusing the store, the store's obligations would be for the September shipment. But the store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. So if the mill is excusing the store, then the store's obligations are for the remaining nine months.

Wait, but the mill's performance was contingent on the September delivery. The store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance, but the store then demanded the remaining shipments to be delivered on time, which would include the September shipment.

So the store is now suing for breach of contract. The store's demand would have to be based on the mill's performance.

Wait, but if the mill is excusing the store, then the store's performance is for the remaining nine months. But the store's demand was that the September shipment is delivered on time. So the store is demanding that the mill fulfill the September shipment, but the mill is excusing, so the store would have to fulfill the remaining nine months.

Wait, but if the mill is excusing, then the store has to pay for the remaining nine months. But the store's demand was that the remaining ones (so including September) are delivered on time. So the store's demand would be based on the mill's performance.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. If the mill is excusing the store, then the store can't perform on the September shipment, but the store's demand is that the mill deliver the September shipment on time. But the mill is excusing, so the store can't perform, leading to a breach.

But the store is suing for breach of contract. So the store claims that the mill breached their contract because the mill couldn't meet the September delivery.

But if the mill is excusing, then the store's performance would be for the remaining nine months, but the store's demand is for the September shipment. So the store's demand is based on the mill's performance.

Wait, perhaps the store is correct because the mill is excusing, so the store has to fulfill the remaining orders, which would include the September shipment. But the mill's performance was dependent on their reserve, which was destroyed, so the mill must have fulfilled their obligations.

Wait, maybe I should think about the performance obligations. If the performance was contingent on a contingency that the seller knew about (the fire), then the seller can excuse the buyer from further performance.

In this case, the mill had a contingency plan. So the store's excuse is valid, and the mill is excusing the seller. So the store's demand for the September shipment is valid as a performance obligation.

But then why did the store refuse? Because they were demanding to get the remaining shipments on time. But if the mill is excusing, the store can't get it on time. So the store's demand is a breach because the mill is excused.

Wait, but the store's demand was that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. So if the mill is excused, the store can't get the September shipment on time. So the store's demand is a breach.

But then, the store's demand would be considered a breach, so the store is liable.

Wait, but the options don't have an option about the store being liable for breach. Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Judgment for the store, because the mill failed to have a contingency plan.

E: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.

H: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.

G: Judgment for the mill, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.

Wait, so the options are about what the court would decide, not what the parties would do.

So the store is suing for breach of contract. The store is claiming that the mill breached their contract because the mill couldn't meet the September delivery.

But if the mill is excusing the store from further performance, then the store's obligations are for the remaining nine months. But the store's demand was that the September shipment is delivered on time. So the store's demand is a performance obligation.

But if the mill is excused, the store can't perform on the September shipment, so the store's demand is a breach.

Wait, but the store's demand was that the remaining shipments are delivered on time. So perhaps the store is saying that the mill failed to deliver the September shipment on time, so the store has a right to demand the remaining shipments to be delivered on time, but if the mill is excused, that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the store's demand is that the mill fulfill the September shipment on time, but if the mill is excused, the store can't. So the store is correct in demanding the September shipment to be on time, but the mill is excused, so the store can't fulfill. Hence, the store is liable.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider whether the mill's performance was performance contingent. If it was, then the store's excuse is valid, and the mill can excuse the store. But if it was performance excusable, then the store is responsible.

So in this case, the mill had a contingency plan, so the performance was performance dependent, and the store's excuse is valid. So the mill can excuse the buyer from further performance. Thus, the store can't perform on the September shipment, leading to breach.

But the store is now suing for breach of contract. So the court would find that the store is responsible for the breach.

Wait, but the options are about the court's holding, not the parties' actions.

So the options are about the outcome, such as who is liable.

So if the mill is excusing the store, then the mill is liable for breach of contract because the store failed to perform on the September shipment (even though the mill was excused).

Wait, but the store's demand was that the remaining shipments are delivered on time. So the store's demand is based on the mill's performance.

If the mill is excusing, then the store is responsible for fulfilling the remaining nine months, but their demand would be based on the mill's performance.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the four options again:

Option A: The mill failed to have a contingency plan, so the store is liable. But in this case, the mill did have a contingency plan, so A is unlikely.

Option E: The mill is liable because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance. So the store fails because the fire caused a problem that the mill couldn't foresee. So the store is liable.

Wait, but the store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. So if the mill had a contingency plan, the store's excuse is valid. So the mill can excuse the store from further performance.

But then, the store's demand for the September shipment would be a breach, because the mill is excused.

So the store is responsible for the breach because the mill is excused. Alternatively, the mill is excused because the store's demand was based on the mill's performance.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the store is liable because the mill was excused from the performance, so the store's failure is a breach.

Wait, but the mill's performance was dependent on the contingency. So the store's excuse is valid, and the mill can excuse the store. But then, the store's demand for the September shipment would be a breach because the mill is excused.

Wait, but the store's demand was about delivering the September shipment on time. The mill was excused, so the store can't perform on the September shipment. So the store's demand is a breach of contract.

Thus, the court would hold that the store is liable for the breach.

But looking at the options, the options don't have "The store is liable for the breach" as an option. Instead, some options are about the judge's decision.

Wait, let me re-read the options:

Option A: Judgment for the store because the mill failed to have a contingency plan.

Option E: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.

Option H: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.

Wait, option H says the mill's performance would not be excused because the forest fire was beyond their control. So the mill's performance would not be excused, so the store is liable.

But in this case, the mill had a contingency plan, so the performance would be excusable, not excusable.

Wait, no. The store's excuse is that the mill had a contingency plan. But if the mill's performance depended on a contingency that was beyond their control, then the mill couldn't excuse the store from further performance.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

The question is whether the contract was performance contingent or performance obligations were excusable.

If the performance was dependent on a contingency that the seller knew about (the fire), then the seller could excuse the buyer from further performance.

But in this case, the mill had a contingency plan, which was a specific action (to have contingency plan). So if the mill knew about the fire, then the store's excuse was valid.

But if the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that was beyond their control, then the store's excuse would not be valid.

Wait, but the problem is that the store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance. The store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. But the problem is that the mill's performance depended on the destruction of their reserve, which was due to a forest fire beyond their control.

So the mill's performance was dependent on an event that was beyond their control (the forest fire). Therefore, the store's excuse would not be valid, and the mill would have to fulfill the obligations.

Wait, but the store's demand was that the remaining shipments (including September) are delivered on time. So if the mill's performance was dependent on an event beyond their control, then the mill must fulfill the obligations, which includes delivering the September shipment on time.

But the store's demand was that the September shipment is delivered on time. So if the mill's performance was dependent on an event beyond their control, then the mill must fulfill the obligation, which would require the store to perform on the September shipment.

But the store was demanding that the remaining shipments be delivered on time, including September. So perhaps the store's demand is valid because it's based on the mill's performance.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing the concepts. Let me try to think about the options.

Option H: The mill's performance would not be excusable because the forest fire was an act of God beyond their control. So the mill's performance would not be excusable, so the store is liable.

But if the mill's performance was dependent on a contingency that was beyond their control, then the mill could not excuse the buyer, so the store is liable.

Wait, in this case, the mill's performance was dependent on the destruction of their reserve, which was due to a forest fire beyond their control. Therefore, the mill's performance was dependent on an unforeseen event, so the mill would have to perform, meaning the store can't fulfill the obligations.

Wait, but the store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance. So if the mill's performance was dependent on an event beyond their control, then the mill cannot excuse the buyer, so the store can't fulfill.

Wait, but I'm getting tangled. Let me think about the options again.

If the mill's performance was performance contingent (i.e., dependent on a contingency that the seller knew about), then the store's excuse is valid. So the mill can excuse the store, and the store's obligations are fulfilled.

But in this case, the mill's performance was dependent on a specific event (the destruction of their reserve) that was beyond their control. So the mill's performance was performance dependent because it was dependent on an event beyond their control.

Wait, no. The mill's performance was dependent on a specific event (the destruction of their reserve), which is beyond their control. Therefore, the mill's performance was performance dependent because it was dependent on an event beyond their control.

Wait, no, the mill's performance was dependent on the destruction of their reserve, which was beyond their control. So the mill's performance was performance dependent because it was dependent on an event beyond their control.

Wait, but the problem is that the store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance. So if the mill's performance was performance dependent, the store's excuse is valid.

But the options don't include an option about the mill's performance being performance dependent. Let's look again.

The options are about the store's demand being valid or the mill's performance being performance dependent.

Wait, the store's demand is that the remaining shipments are delivered on time. If the mill's performance was performance dependent, the store can demand the remaining shipments to be delivered on time, and the mill must fulfill.

But the mill's performance was dependent on the destruction of their reserve, which was due to a forest fire beyond their control. So the mill's performance was performance dependent because it was dependent on an event beyond their control.

So the store's demand is valid, and the mill must fulfill.

But if the store's demand is valid, then the store is liable for breach of contract.

Wait, but the options don't have an option about the store's demand being valid. The options are about the judge's decision.

Wait, looking at the options:

E: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.

So if the mill had a performance issue due to a FORESEEABLE hindrance, then the mill is liable.

Wait, in this case, the forest fire was an unforeseeable hindrance in performance for the mill. So the mill's performance was dependent on a specific event that was beyond their control and was unforeseeable to the judge.

Wait, no. The judge is the one looking at the facts.

So the forest fire was a specific event that the judge considered unforeseeable in the performance of the mill.

So the mill's performance was subject to an unforeseeable hindrance in performance, which caused the mill to be unable to perform on time.

So the mill's performance was performance dependent because it was dependent on the destruction of their reserve, which was beyond their control.

So the store's demand would be based on the mill's performance, but the mill's performance was dependent on an unforeseeable hindrance, so the store's demand is a performance obligation.

Wait, but the store's demand is that the remaining shipments are delivered on time. That would be a performance obligation.

So if the mill's performance was dependent on an unforeseeable hindrance, then the mill must fulfill the obligations. So the store is not liable for breach of contract because the mill's obligations are met.

But wait, the store's demand was that the remaining shipments are delivered on time. If the mill's performance was dependent on an unforeseeable hindrance, then the mill must deliver the remaining shipments on time, so the store's demand is valid and the mill is liable.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, if the mill's performance was performance dependent, then the store's demand is a performance obligation, and the mill can fulfill it, so the store is not liable.

Wait, but the problem is that the store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance. The store's excuse was that the mill had a contingency plan. But if the mill's performance was performance dependent, then the store's excuse is valid.

But the store's demand was that the remaining shipments are delivered on time. So the mill must fulfill the obligations, including deliver the remaining shipments on time, so the store's demand is valid.

Wait, but the store's demand was that the remaining shipments are delivered on time. If the mill's performance was dependent on an unforeseeable hindrance, then the mill must fulfill the obligations, including delivering the remaining shipments on time. Therefore, the store's demand is valid, and the mill is liable.

But the options don't have an option about the store's demand being valid. The options are about the judge's decision.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the options again.

Option H: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire was an act of God beyond their control.

So if the forest fire was an unforeseeable hindrance in performance for the mill, then the mill is liable.

Option E: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.

Same as H.

So the correct answer would be either E or H.

If the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance for the mill, then the mill is liable.

Therefore, the correct answer is either E or H.

Wait, but in this scenario, the store agreed to excuse the mill for further performance. The store's demand was that the remaining shipments are delivered on time.

So the store's demand was based on the mill's performance, which was dependent on the destruction of their reserve, which was beyond their control.

Therefore, the mill's performance was performance dependent, so the store's demand is a performance obligation, and the mill can fulfill it.

Therefore, the store is not liable for breach of contract because the mill fulfilled the obligations.

Wait, but the store's demand was that the remaining shipments are delivered on time. If the mill's performance was dependent on the destruction of their reserve, which was beyond their control, then the mill must deliver the remaining shipments on time. So the store's demand is valid, and the mill is liable.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that the store is liable because the mill had a contingency plan, and the store's excuse is valid.

Wait, but the problem is that the mill had a contingency plan, so the store's excuse is valid, and the mill can excuse the store. But then, the store's demand is for the September shipment. If the mill is excused, then the store can't perform on the September shipment, leading to breach.

So the store is liable for breach of contract because the mill is excused, and the store's demand was valid.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So looking at the options, the closest is option E: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.

Option H is the same.

Wait, but in this scenario, the mill's performance was performance dependent because it was dependent on the destruction of their reserve, beyond their control. So the forest fire was a specific event that caused the destruction of their reserve.

So the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance for the mill. Therefore, the mill is liable.

So the correct answer is H or E.

Wait, but the options are:

E: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.

H: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.

So the forest fire was a specific event, not an act of God. So H is incorrect. E is correct.

So the correct answer would be E: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.

Because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance, the mill is liable for breach of contract.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: Judgment for the mill because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.**

**Explanation:**

The store agreed to excuse the mill from further performance by demanding that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. The mill, however, had a contingency plan, which allowed the store's excuse to be valid. The mill's performance was dependent on the destruction of their reserve, which was beyond their control and was an unforeseeable hindrance in performance. Therefore, the mill is liable for breach of contract because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.
