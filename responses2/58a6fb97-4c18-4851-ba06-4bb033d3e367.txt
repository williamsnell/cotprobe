Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about financial asset returns and the GARCH(1,1) model. Hmm, I need to figure out which features of the return time-series can be captured by this model. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. It's a statistical model used to analyze time-series data, especially in financial markets, where volatility of returns tends to cluster. So GARCH models are good for capturing volatility changes over time.

The question lists four features (i) to (iv), and I have to choose which ones GARCH(1,1) can capture. Let me go through each one.

i) Fat tails in the return distribution. Hmm. Fat tails mean that the distribution has more extreme values than a normal distribution. I recall that GARCH models usually assume normality because they're designed to model the variance, not the distribution's shape. But wait, is that accurate? Or does GARCH account for fat tails through another part of the model, like a t-GARCH (which uses a Student's t-distribution for the error term) or something like that? Oh wait, the standard GARCH model doesn't explicitly model fat tails. So, if the model doesn't account for fat tails, then (i) might not be captured by GARCH(1,1). But wait, maybe it's about the distribution's tail behavior. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. GARCH models focus on the variance, not the distribution's shape. So, if the model doesn't handle fat tails, then this feature (i) is not directly addressed by GARCH. So, I'll mark (i) as not captured by GARCH(1,1).

ii) Leverage effects. Leverage effects occur when a decrease in the price of an asset leads to a higher return on the same asset, which is due to increased leverage from a decrease in debt. For example, during a market downturn, investors might borrow to buy more shares, thus amplifying the returns. I'm not sure if GARCH models can capture that. I know that GARCH models are primarily about variance and how it's affected by past variances and shocks. Leverage effects are more of an asymmetric effect on the return, which GARCH might not capture because it's more about the volatility. So, I'm thinking (ii) might not be a feature GARCH(1,1) can model.

iii) Volatility clustering. Volatility clustering is when large changes in returns tend to be followed by more changes (positive or negative). GARCH models do account for this because they model the variance (volatility squared) as a function of past variances. So, yes, GARCH can capture this phenomenon.

iv) Volatility affecting returns. Oh, right. That's one of the fundamental aspects of GARCH. GARCH models show that volatility (the variance) is a cause of returns. So, if you have a high volatility, the returns tend to be higher in magnitude, even if the average return is zero. So, this is definitely a feature that GARCH can capture.

Wait, but what about the t-GARCH model? Some people use t-GARCH which can capture fat tails, but that's a different model. The standard GARCH(1,1) doesn't have that feature. So, (i) is not captured by GARCH, (ii) is not, (iii) and (iv) are. So which of the options fit this?

Looking back at the options:

Option E says (ii) and (iii) only. But I thought (ii) isn't captured by GARCH. Hmm, did I get that right?

Wait another moment. Leverage effects are about asymmetry in the impact of past shocks. GARCH models, which model variance, might not capture leverage effects because they don't model the direction of the impact. Leverage effects are more about how volatility changes when the underlying asset's price changes, and how leverage causes higher volatility. So, GARCH(1,1) doesn't capture that. So (ii) is not a feature that GARCH(1,1) can model.

So, the features that GARCH(1,1) can capture are:

iii) Volatility clustering (yes)

iv) Volatility affecting returns (yes)

So, that's options (iii) and (iv). Looking at the options, option E is (ii) and (iii) only. But I thought (ii) isn't correct. So, maybe I'm wrong about (ii). Let me think again.

Wait, leverage effects are about the correlation between returns and volatility. Leverage is when a decrease in price leads to a higher return. But GARCH models mainly model the variance (volatility squared). The actual correlation between volatility and returns is captured in the GARCH model because it's about the variance explaining the returns. Wait, no. So, the model captures the variance's effect on the returns but not the direct correlation between volatility and the return. If leverage causes a higher return when volatility is higher, but the GARCH model only models the variance, not the correlation. So, does that mean leverage effects aren't captured?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of it another way. The GARCH model says that volatility is a cause of returns, but it doesn't directly model the leverage effect, which is asymmetric. So, does GARCH capture leverage effects? Or not? I'm not sure. I think leverage effects are more about the asymmetric impact of shocks. GARCH, as a standard model, doesn't model that. So, (ii) is not captured.

So, the correct features captured by GARCH(1,1) are (iii) and (iv). That's option E (ii and iii only?), but wait, no. Option E is (ii) and (iii) only. Wait no, because I concluded (ii) isn't captured.

Wait wait, looking at the options again. The correct features that GARCH(1,1) captures are (iii) and (iv), so the correct option is E: (ii) and (iii) only? That can't be because I thought (ii) isn't captured.

Wait, no. Let me check again.

The options are:

A: (ii) and (iv) only

B: (iii) and (iv) only

C: (i) and (iii) only

D: (i), (ii), and (iv) only

E: (ii) and (iii) only

F: (i) and (iv) only

G: (i), (ii), and (iii) only

H: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)

I: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only

J: (i), (iii), and (iv) only

So, which options have (iii) and (iv)? Option B is (iii) and (iv) only. Option I is (ii), (iii), and (iv) only. So, I think that (ii) isn't captured by GARCH(1,1). So the correct answer would not include (ii).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what each of these features is.

i) Fat tails: yes, the model doesn't handle them, so it's not captured.

ii) Leverage effects: not captured by GARCH(1,1), as I thought.

iii) Volatility clustering: yes, GARCH(1,1) captures this.

iv) Volatility affecting returns: yes, that's a fundamental aspect of GARCH.

So, the correct features are (iii) and (iv), which is option B. But wait, I'm not sure. Because I'm a bit unsure about (ii). Let me think about this again.

Another approach: which of these are GARCH-related.

GARCH models are about modeling variance, so they can capture volatility clustering (which is (iii)), but (iv) is about how volatility affects returns. That's part of the GARCH model. So (iv) is definitely captured.

As for (ii), leverage effects—if the model doesn't account for them, then (ii) is not captured.

So, the features that are captured are (iii) and (iv). That's option B: (iii) and (iv) only.

Wait, but option E is (ii) and (iii) only. So I think I'm conflicting between B and E.

Wait, the question asks, which features are captured by GARCH(1,1). So, (ii) is not. So the correct answer is option B: (iii) and (iv) only. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I thought (i) is the fat tails. Wait, no, (i) is about fat tails, which GARCH doesn't handle. So (i) is not captured.

So the only features are (iii) and (iv) → option B.

The question asks which features of financial asset return time-series can be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model. Let’s analyze each feature:

1. **Fat tails (i):** GARCH models assume normality and do not explicitly model fat tails. Therefore, they do not capture fat tails.

2. **Leverage effects (ii):** Leverage effects are asymmetrical and involve the correlation between volatility and returns. GARCH models focus on variance and do not directly account for leverage effects, which depend on asymmetry in volatility impact.

3. **Volatility clustering (iii):** GARCH(1,1) explicitly models volatility clustering, where large changes in returns are followed by more changes (positive or negative).

4. **Volatility affecting returns (iv):** This is a fundamental aspect of GARCH models, as it captures how volatility influences returns.

From the analysis, features (iii) and (iv) are captured by GARCH(1,1), while (i) and (ii) are not. Among the options, the correct choice is **B: (iii) and (iv) only**.
