Okay, so I've got this question about the Sortino ratio, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through the steps I remember from finance. 

The question gives me two mutual funds, A and B, along with the risk-free rate. I need to calculate the Sortino ratio for Fund A. I'm a bit rusty on some of these formulas, so I'll have to go step by step.

First, what's the Sortino ratio? Oh right, it's a measure of risk-adjusted return. Unlike the Sharpe ratio, which uses standard deviation (volatility) as the risk measure, the Sortino ratio uses the downside deviation, which is the volatility of returns that fall below a minimum threshold, usually the risk-free rate. So, it's more focused on the risk that investors might bear.

The formula for the Sortino ratio is Sortino Ratio = (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Downside Deviation.

Wait, wait. So for Fund A, the return is 15%, the downside deviation is 8%, and the risk-free rate is 2.5%. I need to plug these into the formula.

Wait, but I should make sure the units are consistent. The returns are percentages, so I'll convert them to decimals for calculation. So 15% is 0.15, 8% is 0.08, and the risk-free rate is 2.5% which is 0.025.

So plugging into the formula: (0.15 - 0.025) / 0.08.

Calculating the numerator: 0.15 minus 0.025 is 0.125. Then, 0.125 divided by 0.08.

Hmm, what's 0.125 divided by 0.08? Let me compute that. 0.08 goes into 0.125 how many times? 0.08 * 1.5 is 0.12, so 1.5625. Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Wait, 0.08 * 1.5 is 0.12, so 0.125 is 0.08 * 1.5625. So 1.5625.

Wait, but that's 1.5625, which is approximately 1.56. Looking at the options, option I is 1.56, so that must be the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another thought: the Sortino ratio is (return - risk-free) divided by downside deviation. So 15% - 2.5% is 12.5%, which is 0.125. Downside deviation is 8%, 0.08. So 0.125 / 0.08 is 1.5625. Rounded to two decimal places, it's 1.56. So the answer is I.

The Sortino ratio for Mutual Fund A is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{\text{Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\text{Downside Deviation}}
\]

Plugging in the values:
- Return = 15% = 0.15
- Risk-Free Rate = 2.5% = 0.025
- Downside Deviation = 8% = 0.08

Calculation:
\[
\text{Sortino Ratio} = \frac{0.15 - 0.025}{0.08} = \frac{0.125}{0.08} = 1.5625
\]

The closest option is **1.56**.

Answer: I: 1.56
