Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spring-block oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a spring-block system is a classic example of simple harmonic motion. But wait, the question is a bit more complex. Let me read it again.

The question says: A horizontal spring-block oscillator is in motion when a second block of equal mass falls onto the oscillating block. If the two blocks stick together, what effect does this have on the amplitude of the oscillations?

Oh, right! So when two masses stick together, the system's mass changes. Wait, because both blocks have equal mass, the combined mass would be double the original mass. But how does that affect the amplitude?

I'm a bit fuzzy on energy considerations here. I think when masses stick together, they undergo a perfectly inelastic collision, which means kinetic energy is lost. Oh wait, but in a spring oscillator, the energy is typically conserved in a frictionless system. But maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the spring is horizontal, and the blocks are moving. If the second block falls on the first, the first block's velocity will change. Wait, but in this scenario, I think the second block is coming down and hitting the first. So, the first block is moving, and the second is stationary (assuming it falls from rest, or maybe it's just a collision). Or perhaps the second block is part of the system already, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the second block (mass m) hits the first block which is moving. So the first block's velocity changes because momentum is conserved during the collision.

But in this case, the second block falls onto the first. So the initial state is the first block moving, and the second block at rest. When they stick, the combined mass is 2m. So, initially, the first block has velocity v, and the second is at rest. Then, after collision, they move together with some velocity V.

Wait, but the problem is about the amplitude of the oscillations after the collision. But I'm a bit confused because in a normal spring oscillator, when you add mass, the period changes, but does the amplitude change?

Wait, no. In a simple harmonic oscillator, amplitude depends on the initial conditions like the maximum displacement. So if the system is released from rest at maximum displacement, the amplitude is determined by how much energy is in that system.

But in this case, we're adding mass. Let me think again: when two blocks stick, the combined mass is 2m. The initial velocity of the first block is v. So after the collision, both move with velocity V. But in the collision, assuming no external forces, the momentum is conserved. So m*v = (2m)V. So V = v/2.

But the system's mass changes. Now, the oscillation's amplitude would depend on the kinetic energy before the collision, right? Because energy is conserved. Wait, but when they collide, some of the kinetic energy is lost.

Wait, no, in the collision, assuming perfectly inelastic, the collision is inelastic, so kinetic energy is not conserved. But in the spring oscillator, the system might actually bounce back because the collision imparts some energy loss.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the energy before and after the collision.

Before collision:
The first block is moving with velocity v, and the second is at rest. So the total energy is (1/2)mv².

After collision, both blocks move together. Their combined mass is 2m, and velocity V. So the kinetic energy is (1/2)(2m)V².

Since momentum is conserved, 2mV = m*v → V = v/2. So the kinetic energy after is (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (1/2)(2m)(v²/4) )= (m v²)/4.

Wait, the initial kinetic energy was (1/2)mv², which is (mv²)/2. The final is (mv²)/4. So the energy has decreased by half. So the system would lose half the initial kinetic energy.

But how does this affect the amplitude? Because the initial energy would determine the amplitude. If the energy is lower, the maximum displacement (amplitude) would be lower as well.

Wait, but in a spring oscillator, the maximum displacement (amplitude) is determined by the initial energy. So if the energy is now half, the amplitude is halved.

Wait, but let's think again. The initial energy is E_initial = (1/2) mv². After collision, E_final = (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 )= (1/2)(2m)(v²/4) )= (m v²)/4. Which is exactly half of the initial energy. So the system's energy is now E = 1/2 E_initial.

But in a simple harmonic oscillator, the energy is (1/2) k A², where A is the amplitude. So if the energy is halved, then A would be sqrt(2) times smaller. Wait, wait, no. The energy is (1/2) k A². So if the new energy is (E_initial)/2, then (1/2) k A_new² = (1/2) (E_initial) ). So, (E_initial) is (1/2)k A_initial². So (1/2 k A_new² ) = (1/2) * (1/2 k A_initial²) ). So A_new² = (A_initial²)/2 → A_new = A_initial / sqrt(2).

Which is about 0.707 times the original amplitude. So the amplitude would decrease. But none of the answer options say that. Let's look.

The options are:

A: It depends on initial position in cycle.

B: No effect.

C: Depends on velocity of second block.

Wait, but the second block comes to rest because it fell onto the first, right? Or maybe it's part of the system. Wait, the problem says, "a second block of equal mass falls on top of the oscillating block." So the second block is on top, but perhaps it's a stationary block that hits the first.

So, the initial velocity is the first block moving with velocity v, and the second block is at rest (assuming it falls from rest, or perhaps it's just a stationary block before collision). So the initial momentum is mv, so after collision, the combined mass is 2m, so V = v/2.

But the question is about the amplitude after the collision. Wait, but the spring is horizontal, and the blocks are moving. So does the collision change the amplitude? Because the collision imparts some energy, the system's energy is now lower, but the maximum displacement (amplitude) would be determined by the initial energy before the collision.

Wait, but in reality, the collision leads to energy loss because it's an inelastic collision. So the energy of the system after the collision isn't the same as before. So the spring's potential energy would decrease, leading to a lower amplitude.

Hmm, so the amplitude of the oscillations would decrease. But looking at the options, the choices are:

E: decrease the amplitude.

F: halve the amplitude.

Wait, but earlier I thought the energy is halved, so the amplitude would be sqrt(1/2) times the original, which is about 0.7 times. So about 70% of the original amplitude.

But none of the options have that. The options given are:

E: decrease the amplitude.

F: halve.

G: depends on phase.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says the blocks stick together. So, the collision is inelastic. So, the system's mass is 2m, and the initial velocity is v/2.

The initial kinetic energy was (1/2)mv². After collision, it's (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (1/2)(2m)(v²/4) = (m v²) /4. Which is half of the initial energy.

But the energy in the spring is stored as potential energy, which is (1/2)k A². So the potential energy after collision is (1/2)k A_new² = (1/2) * (m v²/4). Wait, but what about the original potential energy? Wait, the original system (before collision) had the first block moving, but the second isn't part of it. So, perhaps the collision doesn't change the amplitude because the energy is still the same. But that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about potential energy in the spring. The maximum potential energy is when the mass is at the maximum displacement (amplitude). So, the initial energy is (1/2)mv², which equals (1/2)k A². So if the kinetic energy after collision is (1/2)mv²/2, then the potential energy would be (1/2)k A_new² = (1/2)k A_initial² * (1/2) → A_new = A_initial * sqrt( (1/2) ) → which is about 0.707 times, so the amplitude would decrease, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

E: decrease.

F: halve.

G: depends on phase.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the problem is that the second block is attached to the first, so the mass is 2m. But the initial velocity is v. So the initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². After collision, the velocity is v/2, so the kinetic energy is (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (m v²)/4. So the energy is now half.

So the potential energy, which is (1/2)k A², would be (1/2)k A_new² = (1/2) * (1/2) (1/2) k A_initial^2 → because the initial energy is (1/2)k A_initial² = (1/2) m v².

So (1/2) k A_new² = (1/4) (1/2) k A_initial² → A_new² = (1/4) A_initial² → A_new = (1/2) A_initial. So the amplitude would be halved. But wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation.

Wait, let me make it clear. Initial energy E_initial is (1/2)mv².

After collision, E_final = (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2) = (1/2)(2m)(v²/4) )= (m v²)/4.

E_initial is (1/2) m v². So E_final = (E_initial) / 2.

Since E_final = (1/2) k A_new² = (1/2) k (A_initial/2)^2 → (1/2)k A_initial² /4 = (1/8) k A_initial².

But E_initial = (1/2) k A_initial². So E_final is (1/8) k A_initial². So set equal: (1/2) k A_initial² * (1/4) = (1/2) k A_new².

Wait, no. Maybe a better approach: the initial velocity is v, so initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². After collision, the combined mass is 2m, moving with velocity v/2. So the kinetic energy is (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (1/2)(2m)(v²/4) )= (m v²)/4.

So the change in kinetic energy is (1/2 m v²) → (m v²)/4. The potential energy after collision is (1/2)k A_new² = (1/2)k (v/2)^2 * (2m/ (2m)) ) → wait, perhaps I should think about what's the maximum displacement after collision.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that the maximum displacement (amplitude) occurs when all kinetic energy is converted to potential. So, after the collision, the kinetic energy is (m v²)/4, which must equal (1/2)k A_new².

So:

(1/2) k A_new² = (1/2) m v² /4 → (1/2 k A_new²) = (1/8) m v².

But from the initial condition, we have (1/2) k A_initial² = (1/2) m v² → A_initial² = (m v²)/(k).

Substituting:

(1/2 k A_new² ) = (1/8)(k A_initial² )

Multiply both sides by 2/k:

A_new² = (1/4) A_initial² → A_new = (1/2) A_initial.

So the amplitude is halved. But none of the options say that. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

F: halve the amplitude.

So according to this, the amplitude would decrease, and the answer would be F.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the energy is halved, and since E = (1/2)k A², then A is sqrt(E/k) → so if E is halved, A is halved. So that would make the amplitude halved, option F.

But wait, the initial situation: the first block is moving, and the second is at rest. So the initial kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². The second block falls onto the first, so the collision is inelastic, so the combined mass is 2m, moving with velocity v/2.

So the initial kinetic energy is (m v²)/2, and after collision, it's (m v²)/4. So the energy is now half. So the amplitude would be sqrt( (E_final) / ( (1/2)k )) → E_final is (m v²)/4. So (E_final)/( (1/2)k ) ) = (m v²)/(2k ). But from initial conditions, (1/2)k A_initial² = (1/2) m v² → So (m v²)/(2k) )= (1/2) A_initial^2.

Thus, E_final / ( (1/2)k ) ) = (1/2) A_initial^2.

So sqrt(E_final / ( (1/2)k )) )= sqrt( (1/2) A_initial² ) )= (A_initial) * sqrt(1/2 ) ≈ 0.707 A_initial.

So the amplitude would be approximately 0.707 times the original. So the amplitude would decrease, but not by a factor of 2.

Wait, but none of the options say that. The options are:

E: decrease.

F: halve.

G: depends on phase.

So looking back at the options, E is the correct answer. Because the amplitude would decrease.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the initial velocity after collision is v/2, but is that the only thing that matters? Or is there another effect?

Wait, another approach: After the collision, the blocks are stuck and moving together. The spring is in the same system, so the combined mass is 2m.

The initial velocity after collision is v/2. So the system's kinetic energy is (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (m v²)/4.

The potential energy is (1/2)k A².

In a simple harmonic oscillator, the maximum displacement (amplitude) occurs when the kinetic energy is zero and all the energy is potential. So, in the collision, the kinetic energy is (m v²)/4, so that's equal to (1/2)k A_new² → A_new = sqrt( (m v²) / (2k) ) → but from the initial condition, (1/2) k A_initial² = (1/2) m v² → A_initial² = (m v²)/k → so A_new = sqrt( (m v²)/(2k) ) = (1/ sqrt(2)) * sqrt( (m v²)/k ) = (A_initial) / sqrt(2) ≈ 0.707 A_initial.

So the amplitude is reduced, but not by a factor of 2. So which option says that the amplitude decreases? Option E.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check option E: it says "It will decrease the amplitude."

But in this case, the amplitude is lower than before, so yes, it decreases. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would be F, but that was incorrect. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait—what if the second block is attached to the first, but perhaps it also has some mass. Wait, the problem says the second block is equal mass. So, if both blocks have the same mass, then the combined mass is 2m.

But perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the initial velocities. Let me think again: the first block is moving with velocity v, the second is at rest. So the collision is inelastic, so the combined velocity is v/2.

But in the case where the second block is attached to the first, then the system's mass is 2m, and velocity is v/2.

So the energy is (1/2)(2m)(v/2)^2 = (m v²)/4.

That's half the initial kinetic energy.

So the maximum displacement would be sqrt( (m v²)/(2k) ) = sqrt( ( (m v²)/(2k) ) ) → which is (1/sqrt(2)) times the initial amplitude.

Thus, the amplitude would decrease by a factor of sqrt(2), but the options don't have that. So the answer must be E: it will decrease the amplitude.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

E: it will decrease the amplitude.

So the correct answer is E.

The problem involves a horizontal spring-block oscillator where a second block of equal mass falls onto the first, causing them to stick together. The goal is to determine the effect on the amplitude of the oscillations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**: The first block has mass \( m \) and an initial velocity \( v \). The second block is stationary and falls onto the first, causing the combined mass to be \( 2m \). The collision is inelastic, so momentum is conserved:
   \[
   m \cdot v = (2m) \cdot V \implies V = \frac{v}{2}.
   \]

2. **Kinetic Energy After Collision**: The combined mass moves with velocity \( V = \frac{v}{2} \). The kinetic energy after the collision is:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (2m) \cdot \left(\frac{v}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (2m) \cdot \frac{v^2}{4} = \frac{m v^2}{4}.
   \]
   This is half of the initial kinetic energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \implies E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} E_{\text{initial}}.
   \]

3. **Amplitude of Oscillations**: In a simple harmonic oscillator, the maximum displacement (amplitude) occurs when all the energy is stored as potential energy. For the combined mass \( 2m \), the potential energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{potential}} = \frac{1}{2} k A^2.
   \]
   From the initial conditions, the initial amplitude \( A_{\text{initial}} \) is related to the initial kinetic energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} k A_{\text{initial}}^2.
   \]
   After the collision, the energy is halved, so:
   \[
   E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} k A_{\text{initial}}^2 = \frac{1}{4} k A_{\text{initial}}^2.
   \]
   Equating this to the potential energy expression:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} k A_{\text{final}}^2 = \frac{1}{4} k A_{\text{initial}}^2 \implies A_{\text{final}} = \frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707 A_{\text{initial}}.
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The amplitude decreases as a result of the energy loss during the inelastic collision. The amplitude does not simply halve or depend on the phase, so the correct answer is:
