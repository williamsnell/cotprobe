Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the de Broglie wavelength of a man skiing down a mountain. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle. Oh right, the formula is lambda equals h divided by momentum. So lambda equals h over p. 

Wait, let me think. The de Broglie equation is λ = h / (m*v), right? Oh wait, m is mass, v is velocity. But wait, do I need to convert units here? The mass is given in kilograms, and the velocity in centimeters per second. Oh, right, I should probably convert everything to the same units, preferably meters and kilograms since the constants are usually in SI units.

So the man's mass is 88 kg. The velocity is 5.0e5 cm/s. Oh wait, what's 5.0e5 cm/s in meters per second? Because 1 m is 100 cm. So 5e5 cm is 5e5 / 100 = 5e3 m/s. So 5000 m/s.

So velocity is 5e3 m/s. Now, momentum p is m*v. So p = 88 kg * 5e3 m/s. Let me calculate that. 88 * 5e3 is 440,000 kg·m/s. So 4.4e5 kg·m/s.

De Broglie wavelength is h divided by p. The Planck constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So lambda = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (4.4e5 kg·m/s).

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So J·s is kg·m²/s. So the units for h are kg·m²/s, and p is kg·m/s. So when you divide, the kg and m/s cancel out. So the units are meters, which makes sense for wavelength.

Let me compute the numbers. 6.626e-34 divided by 4.4e5. Hmm, 6.626 / 4.4 is approximately 1.506. So 1.506e-34 / 1e5 is 1.506e-39 meters? Wait, no, wait. Because 4.4e5 is 4.4 x 10^5. So 6.626e-34 / 4.4e5 = (6.626 /4.4 ) * 1e-39. I think that's right because 1e-34 divided by 1e5 is 1e-39.

Wait, let me compute that. 6.626 divided by 4.4. Let me do that: 4.4 goes into 6.626. 4.4*1.5 is 6.6, so 1.506 approximately. So 1.506e-34 / 1e5 is 1.506e-39 meters. Wait, but the options are in 1e-37 or 1e-36 range. So wait, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion somewhere.

Wait a second, the initial velocity was 5.0e5 cm/s. Oh wait, wait, I thought 5e5 cm/s is 5e3 m/s, but wait, 5e5 cm is 5e5 cm, which is 5e5 / 100 = 5e3 m. So that's correct. So velocity is 5e3 m/s.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. 6.626e-34 divided by (88 kg *5e3 m/s). Let me compute the denominator again. 88 *5e3 is 440,000 kg·m/s, which is 4.4e5 kg m/s. So h=6.626e-34 J s = kg m²/s.

So lambda = 6.626e-34 / 4.4e5 = (6.626 /4.4) * 1e-39. 6.626 /4.4 is about 1.506, so 1.506e-39 meters. Wait, that's a very small wavelength, which makes sense for an electron or something with such mass. But looking at the options, they are all in the 1e-36 or 1e-37 cm range. Wait a minute, but I converted the velocity into m/s. Oh wait, no, the initial velocity was given in cm/s. Oh wait, no, wait, no, 5.0e5 cm/s is 5e3 m/s. So that's correct.

But wait, what's 1e-39 meters? Because 1 m is 100 cm. So 1e-39 meters is 1e-37 cm. Because 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1e-39 meters is 1e-37 cm. Wait, wait: 1 m = 1e2 cm. So 1e-39 m = 1e-39 * 1e2 cm = 1e-37 cm. Oh! So the wavelength is 1.506e-39 m = 1.506e-37 cm. But looking at the options, the closest would be option F, which is 1.5e-37 cm.

Wait, but the options list includes some exact numbers. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 7.5e-38 cm
B:8.0e-38
C:2.5e-37
D:1.7e-37
E:2.0e-37
F:1.5e-37
G:1.2e-36
H:3.0e-37
I:1.0e-36
J:1.0e-37

Wait, so option F is 1.5e-37 cm, which matches our calculation. So the answer should be F.

To determine the de Broglie wavelength of an 88 kg man skiing down Mt. Tremblantin, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is the Planck constant, and \( p = m \cdot v \) is the momentum. The mass \( m \) is 88 kg, and the velocity \( v \) is \( 5.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{cm/s} \). First, convert the velocity to meters per second:

\[
v = 5.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{cm/s} = 5.0 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Now calculate the momentum:

\[
p = m \cdot v = 88 \, \text{kg} \cdot 5.0 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s} = 4.4 \times 10^5 \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Substitute \( h \) and \( p \) into the de Broglie formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4.4 \times 10^5} = \frac{6.626}{4.4} \times 10^{-39} \approx 1.506 \times 10^{-39} \, \text{m}.
\]

Convert meters to centimeters (\( 1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm} \)):

\[
\lambda \approx 1.506 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{cm}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the closest match is:

- **Option F: \( 1.5 \times 10^{-37} \, \text{cm} \)**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: F**
