Okay, so I'm looking at this question about the commoners in Aztec villages. Hmm, Aztec is pretty old, right? I remember that Aztec villages were often quite isolated, especially in the south. They didn't really have much infrastructure, and the main cities were big, like the capital, Colac. 

The question is about the commonersâ€”people who weren't wealthy or couldn't afford large estates. So they probably lived in simpler living conditions. The options are A to J, each giving a different scenario.

Option A says they paid high taxes to the local governor. That doesn't sound right. High taxes would make it harder to live in a better place, but I thought the commoners didn't have to pay as much; maybe they could afford basic needs without so much tax.

Option B says they were under constant threat of slavery. I'm not sure. Aztec didn't have slavery; they had human sacrificed animals like serpents for food. Also, I thought the Aztecs were more about controlling their rulers than having slaves.

Option C suggests they were mostly left alone and did fairly well. That seems plausible. The villages were isolated, so the commoners were probably not subject to the king's control. They might have their own rulers, like the king's son, but maybe they were self-sufficient.

Option D says they were under direct control of the high priest, who demanded sacrifices. That's not right. The high priest was more like the ruler, but I don't think they directly controlled them. Instead, the commoners might be controlled by others, maybe the king's son or other rulers.

Option E says they were heavily policed by the king's guards. Again, I don't think that's the case. The king's guards would be more for defense against external threats, not for internal control. The commoners probably didn't have such police presence.

Option F says they were ruled by an iron fist by the king, with armies stationed there. That doesn't sound right. The king's armies were about military strength, not ruling. The Aztecs didn't have armies stationed; they were more about internal governance.

Option G says they had to send half their maize to the king. I'm not sure about this. Maybe the king wanted them to provide food, but I thought the commoners didn't have to send their own food. Maybe they had to rely on wilds, but it's not clear.

Option H says they had to send all their children to the city. That doesn't make sense. The Aztecs probably didn't send children to the capital. It's more likely they kept them in rural areas where they could grow their own food.

Option I says they had no protection from north-facing states. That's possible, but I don't recall the Aztecs having extensive protection. They were more about controlling their rulers and their own leaders.

Option J says they were forced to work on large-scale irrigation. I'm not sure about this. I thought the Aztecs were more about agriculture and controlling the land, but maybe they had some irrigation too. Or maybe it's more about the rulers' control.

So going back, I think option C is the best answer. The commoners were isolated, so they didn't have to pay taxes to the king or be under the king's control. They were self-sufficient and lived in their own villages. That makes sense because the Aztecs were known for their isolated villages with no external threats beyond the king's.

The commoners in Aztec villages, such as those in Capilco and Cuexcomate, were isolated and had no direct control over the king. They lived in their own villages with no external threats, relying on their own resources. The correct answer is:

**C: were mostly left alone and did fairly well for themselves.**

ANSWER: C
