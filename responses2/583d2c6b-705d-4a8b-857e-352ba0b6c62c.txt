Question:

A shopper suffered injuries to her back and legs when she slipped on a loose piece of carpeting in a hallway connecting a department store and a cafeteria. The shopper brought suit against the owner of the entire building. The owner claimed that since he leased the cafeteria, he no longer retained any control over the connecting hallway. If the shopper offers into evidence the fact that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid, the court should rule that the evidence is

Options:

A: admissible, because it shows the owner's responsibility for maintaining safe conditions.
B: inadmissible, because the owner's actions after the accident do not pertain to the conditions at the time of the accident.
C: inadmissible, because it is evidence of a good deed by the owner after the accident.
D: inadmissible, because it is speculation about the owner's control over the hallway.
E: admissible, because it proves the owner had the power to make changes in the hallway.
F: admissible, because it shows that the owner retained ownership and control.
G: admissible, because it demonstrates the owner's negligence in not maintaining the hallway previously.
H: admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.
I: inadmissible, because the evidence is irrelevant to the accident.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically regarding whether a certain piece of evidence is admissible in a lawsuit. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is a shopper who got hurt because she slipped on a loose carpet in a hallway connecting a store to a cafeteria. She sued the owner of the building, who claims the owner no longer has control over the hallway. The shopper brings evidence that two days after the accident, the owner re-laid the carpet. Now, the question is whether this evidence is admissible.

Hmm, I remember that evidence must be related to the facts of the case, and it must be admissible under the rules of evidence. So, the key point here is whether the evidence given by the shopper meets these criteria.

First, let me think about what evidence that is. The evidence is about the owner re-laying the carpet two days after the accident. So, the question is whether this evidence is admissible as a fact witness testifying to a subsequent action.

Wait, but I also remember that evidence must be directly related to the facts at the time the event occurred, unless it's under a rule that allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration. I think there's a rule about evidence established after the event but before the declaration. Let me try to recall.

Oh right, the Rule of Reversal. Or wait, no, that's when the event occurred, and the evidence is established after. Or maybe it's the Rule of Reversal, which allows evidence established after the fact but before the declaration in some cases. Wait, no, the Reversal Rule is for the time of the event itself. So, after the event, the evidence can be established but not yet made public.

Wait, let me get this straight. The Reversal Rule states that evidence established after the event but before the declaration is admissible. So, for instance, if a fact was known at the time the event occurred but not yet stated, that can be admitted as evidence. But if it's established after the event, it's not admissible unless it's under a specific exception, like the Reversal Rule.

Wait, in this case, the evidence is about the owner re-laying the carpet two days after the accident. So, the time here is more than a day after. So, that's more than the Reversal Rule's time period. The Reversal Rule typically allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration to be admitted, but if it's more than a day after, that's a different situation.

Wait, another rule I remember is the Rule of Reversal. It's about the time when the event happened. If the event happened at a specific time, and the evidence is established after that time but before the declaration, it's not admissible unless it's in a certain situation. But perhaps I'm mixing up different rules here.

Wait, let me think again. The Reversal Rule (Rule 1) states that if the event occurred at a specific time, and the evidence is established after that time but before the declaration, it's not admissible unless it's in a situation where it's established after the event but before the declaration and is under a specific exception (like when it's established prior to the declaration). But if it's established after the event, even a day or more, that's not allowed unless it's under the Reversal Rule.

Wait, perhaps the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration. So, if the event happened, say, yesterday, and the evidence is today's statement, that might be allowed. But if it's established after, like two days, that might not be allowed unless it's under a certain exception.

Alternatively, there's the Rule of Reversal, which says that prior declaration can be used as evidence if established after the event. So, the idea is that if the event happened, and the evidence is established after that but before a declaration, then it's allowed. But if it's established after, even a day, then it's not allowed unless it's in a specific situation.

Wait, but in this case, the owner re-laid the carpet two days after the accident. So, the event was the accident, the event occurred in December, and the evidence is presented on January 1st, which is two days later. So, this is more than a day after. So, under the Reversal Rule, if the event occurred on a specific day, and the evidence is established after that but before the declaration (which is January 1, perhaps), is that admissible?

Wait, the Reversal Rule says that if the event occurred on a specific day, and the evidence is established after that day but before the declaration, then it's not admissible unless it's under a specific exception. But some sources mention that the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration to be admitted, except when it's established after the event and before the declaration, and it's in a situation that the Reversal Rule doesn't cover.

Alternatively, perhaps the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration, but only in certain circumstances like when the event has already occurred and the declaration is yet to happen. Wait, no, that might not be right.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think again. The Reversal Rule, as per Rule 1, says that if a statement is established after the event took place but before the declaration, then it's not admissible unless it's established under a specific exception or if the event has already occurred and the declaration is yet to happen.

Wait, another rule: the Rule of Reversal applies to the time of the event itself. If the event happened at a specific time, and the evidence is established after that time but before the declaration, it's not admissible unless it's in a situation where it's established under a specific exception, like under the Reversal Rule.

Wait, perhaps the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration to be admitted, as long as it's established before the declaration. But if the event is in 2023, and the declaration is in 2024, then the evidence is established after the event but before the declarationâ€”so that's allowed under the Reversal Rule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about when the Reversal Rule applies. The Reversal Rule states that evidence established after the event but before the declaration is not admissible unless it's established under a specific exception (like the Reversal Rule) or if the event has already occurred and the declaration is yet to happen.

Wait, but the Reversal Rule allows for the evidence to be admitted if it's established after the event but before the declaration. So, in this case, the owner re-laid the carpet two days after the accident. So, the event was the accident in, say, December, and the evidence is presented in January. So, the event happened on December, and the evidence is established on January 1, which is two days later.

So, under the Reversal Rule, is that evidence admissible? Because the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration. So, yes, in that case, the evidence is admissible.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me see if any other rules apply.

Another rule is the Rule of Reversal, which says that prior declarations can be used as evidence if established after the event but before the declaration. But that's about the declaration, not the re-laying.

Wait, no. The Rule of Reversal says that prior declarations can be used as evidence if established after the event but before the declaration. So, if the owner was about to make a declaration about the condition, but the evidence is presented after the event but before that declaration, it's allowed.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the Reversal Rule and the Reversal Rule exception. The Reversal Rule allows for the establishment of evidence after the event but before a declaration, and it's admissible. But under the Reversal Rule exception, perhaps if the event occurred and the declaration is yet to happen, then the evidence is not admissible.

Wait, perhaps the Reversal Rule says that evidence established after the event but before the declaration is allowed unless it's established under a specific exception. So, in this case, the owner re-laid the carpet after the accident, so perhaps it's allowed as evidence under the Reversal Rule.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the evidence is about a subsequent action (the re-laying) is relevant to the accident.

Wait, another angle: evidence established after the event but before the declaration is admissible unless it's established under a specific exception or if the event has already occurred and the declaration is yet to happen. So in this case, since the owner is re-laying the carpet after the accident, and if the owner is about to declare the condition as fixed, the re-laying is evidence of their subsequent action, which is admissible under Reversal Rule.

Alternatively, perhaps the Reversal Rule allows for the evidence to be admitted, but only if it's established after the event but before the declaration.

Wait, another possibility is that in this case, the evidence is about the owner's subsequent action, so it's admissible under the Reversal Rule. So the court would admiss it.

Wait, but wait another moment. The Reversal Rule allows for the evidence to be admitted if it's established after the event but before the declaration. So, the re-laying happened after the accident, so the court would admit it.

Wait, but I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

A: admissible because it shows owner's responsibility for safe conditions. I think the Reversal Rule doesn't address the owner's responsibility, unless it's about the condition.

B: inadmissible because owner's actions after accident don't pertain to the time of the accident. But the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event, so B is incorrect.

C: inadmissible because it's evidence of a good deed. Well, a good deed is about the owner's prior actions, not the subsequent ones. So C is incorrect.

D: inadmissible because it's speculation about owner's control. Under the Reversal Rule, the evidence is established after the event, so it's admissible.

E: inadmissible because it's irrelevant to the accident. No, because it's about the owner's subsequent action, which is relevant.

F: admissible because it shows owner retained control. The Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration, so this is correct.

G: shows owner's negligence. The evidence is about a subsequent action, not negligence.

H: admissible because it's relevant. Yes, because it's about the owner's subsequent action, which is relevant.

I: inadmissible because it's irrelevant. No, because it's about the owner's action after the accident.

Wait, but according to the Reversal Rule, the evidence is relevant because it's established after the event, so it's admissible. So both F and H would be correct. But looking at the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think: the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration. So the evidence presented is admissible. So, in this case, the evidence is admissible.

Looking at the options, option F says it's admissible because it shows the owner retained control. Option H: admissible because it's relevant to the issue.

Wait, but the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration. So, the court would admit it, which makes F correct. However, the question is about the effect on the court's decision. So, the evidence is admissible.

But wait, another thought: the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration. So, the evidence is admissible. So, the court would rule admissible, which would be option F.

Wait, but another point: the rule about the Reversal Rule says that evidence established after the event but before the declaration is admissible. So, F and H are both correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, each is a separate choice. So, if the evidence is admissible, then F and H are correct. But the options list each as single choices.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The Reversal Rule (Rule 1) says that evidence is not admissible if it's established after the event but before the declaration. But in this case, the event is the accident, and the evidence is two days after. So, the evidence is established after the event, which is against the rule.

Wait, no, the rule says that evidence established after the event but before the declaration is not admissible unless it's established under a specific exception or if the event has already occurred and the declaration is yet to happen.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. The Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration. So, the evidence is admissible. So, F would be correct.

But another rule: the Reversal Rule exception. There's a different exception when the event has already occurred and the declaration is yet to happen. So, in that case, the Reversal Rule does not allow the evidence. But in this case, the owner hasn't declared yet; the question is whether the evidence is admissible.

Wait, but the Reversal Rule exception (Rule 1.5) states that evidence established after the event but before the declaration is not admissible unless it's established under a specific exception. So, if the owner has not yet declared, then the Reversal Rule would not allow the evidence unless it's established under a specific exception.

Wait, but in this case, the owner is yet to declare. So, under Rule 1.5, the evidence is not admissible unless it's established under a specific exception. But what exceptions are there? Rule 1.5(b) allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration under certain exceptions, like the good deed exception.

Wait, the Good Deed Rule (Rule 2) says that evidence of a good deed by the owner after the event is admissible. So, when the owner re-laid the carpet, that's a good deed. So, maybe the evidence is admissible under the Good Deed Rule.

Wait, but the Reversal Rule and the Good Deed Rule are both rules that allow for evidence established after the event but before the declaration. Or is one applicable and the other not?

Wait, I think the Good Deed Rule (Rule 2) allows for evidence of a good deed by the owner after the accident. So, the evidence presented in January is a good deed. So, the court could admit it under Rule 2.

But then, the Reversal Rule allows for it under Rule 1.5. So, which rule applies in this case?

Wait, perhaps the Good Deed Rule is more specific and would allow the evidence, while the Reversal Rule is a general rule. So, in this case, the evidence is admissible under both, but the Good Deed Rule is more specific.

Wait, the question is about whether the evidence is admissible under the rules. So, the fact that the evidence is a good deed (under Rule 2) would allow it to be admitted.

Alternatively, the Reversal Rule (Rule 1.5) would allow the evidence under the Good Deed Rule (Rule 2), which is a sub-rule, so perhaps it's allowed.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think of the options again.

Looking at the options:

H: admissible because it demonstrates the owner's negligence in not maintaining the hallway.

Wait, no, because if the owner is not maintaining it, that doesn't directly relate. The evidence is about the owner re-laying it, not about maintaining. So H is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the Reversal Rule allows for the evidence under Rule 1.5. So, if the re-laying is a good deed, then the court can admit it as evidence of the owner's subsequent actions. So, maybe the court would rule that the evidence is admissible under both the Reversal Rule and the Good Deed Rule.

But if the Good Deed Rule is a specific exception under Rule 1, then the evidence would be allowed. So, the court would rule that the evidence is admissible under Rule 1.5.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think if any of the options match.

Option F says it's admissible because it shows the owner retained control. But that's not directly relevant to the issue. The issue is about the owner's negligence in not maintaining the hallway before the accident. The evidence is about the owner's subsequent action, not about maintenance.

Option H says it's admissible because it's relevant to the issue. Yes, because it's about the owner's action after the accident, which is relevant to the injury caused by the accident.

So, the court must admit the evidence because it's relevant to the issue. Therefore, option H is correct.

Wait, but another consideration: the Reversal Rule allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration to be admitted. So, the evidence is presented in January, which is after the event of the accident, so under the Reversal Rule, it's admissible.

But another point: the Reversal Rule also allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration under the Good Deed Rule. So, perhaps the evidence is admissible under both, but the Good Deed Rule is a specific exception within Rule 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the Reversal Rule allows for the evidence, and the Good Deed Rule is another rule that allows for evidence established after the event but before the declaration.

So, in this case, the court would rule that the evidence is admissible because it shows the owner retained control (but that's not directly relevant), or because it's relevant to the issue (which is the owner's subsequent action). So, the court would admit the evidence because it's relevant.

Wait, but the question is, if the evidence is admissible, which option is correct.

Looking at the options:

A: admissible because shows responsibility. No, because the owner is not responsible yet.

B: inadmissible because it's after the event. No, because it's established after.

C: inadmissible because it's a good deed. No, because the issue is about ownership.

D: inadmissible because it's speculation. No.

E: inadmissible because irrelevant. No, it's relevant.

F: admissible because shows retained control. Not relevant to the issue.

G: admissible because shows regulation. Not directly relevant.

H: admissible because it's relevant. Correct.

So, the court would rule that the evidence is admissible because it's relevant to the issue, which is the owner's subsequent action. So, the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The evidence presented by the shopper, which is about the owner re-laying the hallway two days after the accident, is admissible. This is because the evidence is relevant to the issue of the owner's subsequent action, which directly relates to the injury caused by the accident. 

The court would rule that the evidence is admissible because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's subsequent action. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: H
