Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the value of 28 multiplied by 42. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember from math class that multiplying two numbers can be done step by step. Maybe I can break it down into smaller parts to make it easier.

First, let me write down the numbers: 28 and 42. Hmm, 28 is the same as 20 plus 8, right? And 42 is 40 plus 2. So maybe I can multiply each part separately and then add them up.

Wait, no, actually, I think the standard method is to multiply each digit and then add. Alternatively, I could use the distributive property. Let me try that. So 28 times 42 can be broken down as (20 + 8) multiplied by (40 + 2). Using the distributive property, that would be 20*40 plus 20*2 plus 8*40 plus 8*2.

Calculating each part:
20*40 is 800.
20*2 is 40.
8*40 is 320.
8*2 is 16.

Now adding them all together: 800 + 40 is 840, plus 320 is 1160, plus 16 gives 1176. So 28 times 42 equals 1176.

Looking at the options, I check each one. Option F is 1,176. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: 1,176.
