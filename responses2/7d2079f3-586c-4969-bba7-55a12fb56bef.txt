Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an artificial satellite and a meteor colliding with it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on orbital mechanics, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the satellite is in a circular orbit just above Earth's atmosphere. That's a stable orbit, right? So I remember that for a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force. The speed is such that the gravitational pull keeps it in orbit without needing any additional thrust.

Now, a small meteor hits the satellite at point P. The problem says the meteor increases the satellite's speed by 1% but doesn't change the direction. Wait, so the speed increases, but direction is the same. Oh, wait, no. Wait, no, the meteor is moving and colliding with the satellite. So the meteor's velocity is added to the satellite's velocity at point P. But wait, no, the problem says the meteor's collision increases the satellite's speed by 1% but doesn't change the direction. Hmm, so maybe the meteor is moving in the same direction as the satellite's current motion at that point, and its speed increases by 1% relative to the satellite's speed. But wait, the problem says the speed increases by 1% but the direction remains the same. So the satellite's velocity at P is in some direction, and the meteor hits it, adding 1% of that speed.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say the satellite's velocity is v at point P. The meteor comes in with some velocity v', maybe the same as the satellite's direction? Or perhaps, the meteor is moving tangentially to the orbit at point P, so it changes the satellite's velocity direction too. Wait, the problem says the direction doesn't change. So the meteor hits the satellite with some velocity, and the direction of the satellite's velocity at that point is the same as before. That means the meteor's velocity is in the same direction as the satellite's velocity at that point, but maybe a different magnitude.

Wait, no. Let me re-read the question. "increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity." Oh! So the meteor hits the satellite at point P, and it adds 1% to the satellite's speed, but the direction remains the same as the satellite's velocity at that moment. So the meteor's velocity vector is the same as the satellite's velocity at point P, but its speed increases by 1%. Wait, no, because the meteor is just a small object hitting the satellite, so maybe the meteor's velocity is in the same direction as the satellite's velocity at that point. So when the meteor hits, it's adding to the satellite's velocity in the same direction. Or wait, is it that the meteor's velocity is such that the direction doesn't change, but the speed increases by 1%?

Wait, perhaps the meteor's velocity is in the same direction as the satellite's velocity at point P. So, the meteor's velocity vector is the same as the satellite's velocity vector at point P, but its speed increases by 1%. So the meteor's velocity is v' = 1.01 * v, where v is the satellite's velocity at P. But wait, that would mean the meteor's velocity is higher than the satellite's. Hmm, but that might not make sense in a collision scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the meteor's velocity is in the same direction as the satellite's, but its speed is higher. But the problem says the speed increases by 1% but the direction doesn't change.

Wait, but the meteor is a small object, so perhaps it's moving in the same direction as the satellite's velocity, but with a slightly higher speed. So the satellite's velocity at point P is v. The meteor's velocity is v plus 1% of v, which would be 1.01v. But wait, that would mean the meteor is moving faster than the satellite. But that seems counterintuitive because the meteor is hitting the satellite. Alternatively, perhaps the meteor's velocity is in the same direction as the satellite's velocity at that point but with a slightly higher speed, allowing the satellite's speed to increase by 1% in addition to (or instead of?) this.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the meteor's velocity is equal to the satellite's velocity at point P, but with a 1% increase. So the meteor hits the satellite, and its velocity is v plus 1%v = 1.01v. Hmm, but that's probably not correct because the meteor is a separate object. In reality, when a meteor hits a satellite, they'd probably exchange momentum, but the problem states that the direction remains the same, so perhaps the meteor's velocity at the point of collision is in the same direction as the satellite's velocity, but with a higher speed. So (v) is the satellite's velocity, and the meteor's is v + 0.01v = 1.01v.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. The problem says the meteor increases the satellite's speed by 1%, so perhaps the meteor's velocity is v plus an additional 1%, but in the same direction as the satellite's. Alternatively, perhaps the meteor's speed increases by 1% in addition to any other changes, but the direction remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the meteor's speed is higher, so the combined effect is an increase in the satellite's speed. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the conservation of momentum here, perhaps.

Wait, the meteor hits the satellite, so the total momentum before the collision is the momentum of the satellite plus the momentum of the meteor. After the collision, the momentum of the satellite would increase. But the problem says the meteor's speed increases by 1%, so the meteor's velocity is higher, but the direction is the same.

Wait, perhaps the meteor is moving in the same direction as the satellite's velocity at point P. So, suppose the meteor's velocity is v_m, and the satellite's velocity at that point is v_s. The problem says the meteor causes the satellite's speed to increase by 1%. So, perhaps the meteor's velocity is such that the combined effect is an increase in the satellite's speed by 1%.

But wait, perhaps the meteor's velocity is such that it imparts an impulse to the satellite. So the meteor's velocity is v_m = v_s + delta_v, but delta_v is 1% of v_s. So, let me model this.

Let me denote:

Before collision:

- Satellite's velocity: v_s (magnitude, tangential to orbit)
- Meteor's velocity: v_m (unknown, but same direction as v_s)

After collision:

- Satellite's velocity: v_s_new = v_s + delta_v (delta_v = 0.01 v_s)
- Meteor's velocity: v_m_new = v_m + delta_v_m (but the problem says the direction doesn't change, so delta_v_m is 0.01 v_m, but no, wait the problem says "increasing its speed by 1%", so the meteor's speed increases by 1%? Or the satellite's increases by 1%?

Wait, the problem states: "increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity." So the satellite's speed increases by 1%, but the meteor's velocity's direction remains the same (as the satellite's velocity direction at that point). So the meteor's velocity before the collision is the same as the satellite's velocity, but perhaps with a higher speed. Or, the meteor's velocity is in the same direction as the satellite's, but with a higher speed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the conservation of momentum.

Assume the meteor is much smaller than the satellite, so its mass is negligible. So, the momentum of the system (satellite + meteor) is the sum of their individual momenta.

Before collision:

Momentum of satellite: m * v_s
Momentum of meteor: m' * v_m

After collision:

Momentum of satellite: m*(v_s + delta_v) [since speed increases by 1%]
Momentum of meteor: m'*(v_m + delta_v_m) [since speed increases by 1%].

But wait, the problem says the speed increases, but the direction doesn't change. So the meteor's velocity after collision must be in the same direction as before, but with a higher speed. So, if the meteor's original velocity is v_m in the same direction as v_s, then after collision, its velocity is v_m + delta_v_m, where delta_v_m is such that the speed increases by 1%. But wait, if the direction is the same, and the speed increases, the velocity vector would change. Hmm, but the problem says the direction doesn't change. So perhaps the meteor's velocity is the same direction as the satellite's velocity, but with a higher speed. So, the meteor's velocity after collision is v_m = v_s + 0.01 v_s = 1.01 v_s.

Wait, that makes sense. So the meteor hits the satellite, and because it's moving faster, it imparts an additional speed to the satellite.

So, the satellite's velocity before collision is v_s (tangential to the orbit). The meteor's velocity at the point of collision is also v_s (same direction, same speed). Wait, but the problem says the speed increases by 1%, so the meteor's speed is 1.01 v_s. Or wait, perhaps the meteor's velocity is higher, but in the same direction, but the problem says "increasing its speed by 1%."

Wait, let me rephrase: The meteor's speed increases by 1% (so from v to 1.01v) but the direction remains the same as before. So the meteor's velocity vector is the same direction as the satellite's, but with a speed of 1.01v.

But the satellite is moving at v_s (which is the same as the meteor's velocity at the point of collision), so when the meteor hits, the two objects (meteor and satellite) are moving in the same direction with the same speed. But that would mean no change in velocity. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, no. The satellite is moving at v_s, and the meteor is moving at 1.01 v_s. So the meteor's velocity is higher, but same direction. So when the meteor hits the satellite, the two collide.

Wait, but for the collision, the momentum of the meteor would be m * 1.01 v_s, and the satellite's momentum is m * v_s. After collision, their combined mass is 2m, and their velocity would be (m v_s + m * 1.01 v_s) / (2m) ) = (v_s (1 + 1.01)) / 2 = (2.01 v_s ) / 2 = 1.005 v_s. So the combined velocity increases by 0.5%.

Wait, but that's where the satellite's speed comes from. So the satellite's speed increases by 0.5% because the meteor's high speed imparts some momentum.

Wait, but the problem says the speed increases by 1%, right? So wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see: if the meteor's speed is 1.01 v_s, then the combined speed is (m v_s + m (1.01 v_s )) / (2m) ) = (v_s (1 + 1.01 )) / 2 = (2.01 v_s)/2 = 1.005 v_s. So the new speed is 1.005 v_s, which is a 0.5% increase. But the problem says the speed increases by 1%. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the meteor's velocity is 1.01 v_s, but only in the direction of the satellite's velocity. Wait, but that would mean the meteor's velocity is 1.01 times the satellite's velocity. So the combined velocity would be (m v_s + m * 1.01 v_s) / (m + m) )= (v_s (1 + 1.01 )) / 2 = 1.005 v_s, as before.

Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the meteor's velocity is more than the satellite's. So the problem says the meteor increases the satellite's speed by 1%. Let me think: the meteor's speed is 1.01 times the satellite's speed at the point of collision.

Wait, but then, the combined velocity would be (m v + m (1.01 v )) / (m + m) ) = (v (1 + 1.01 ) ) / 2 = 1.005 v. So the satellite's speed increases by 0.5%, but the problem says it's 1%. So this doesn't align. Therefore, perhaps the meteor's speed is higher. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the meteor's speed is v_m = (v_s + 1% v_s ) = 1.01 v_s. Then the combined momentum would be m (v_s + 1.01 v_s ) = 2.01 m v_s. The combined mass is 2m. So the new velocity is 2.01 v_s / 2 = 1.005 v_s. So the speed increases by 0.5%. But the problem states 1% increase. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the meteor's speed isn't 1% of the original v_s, but 1% of the new speed. So the problem says the speed increases by 1%, but the direction remains the same. So perhaps the meteor's speed is 1.01 times the original speed, not the new.

Wait, no. The wording is: "increasing its speed by 1%", which would mean the new speed is 1% higher than the original. So the meteor's speed increases by 1%: v_m = 1.01 v_s.

But that leads to the combined velocity of 1.005 v_s, which is a 0.5% increase. But the problem says the speed increases by 1%, which contradicts this. Alternatively, perhaps the meteor's speed is 1% relative to the original, but the direction is same as the satellite's velocity. So the meteor's velocity is v_m = (1.01) v_s.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm misunderstanding the momentum transfer. Let me think about the problem again: the meteor hits the satellite, and the speed increases by 1% but the direction remains same. So the meteor's velocity is in the same direction as the satellite's, but perhaps higher speed.

Wait, but in reality, when a meteor hits a satellite, it would exchange momentum, but this is a simplified scenario. So perhaps the change in the satellite's velocity is such that the speed increases by 1%, and the direction remains the same. So the meteor's velocity is v_m = v_s + 0.01 v_s = 1.01 v_s.

Wait, but that would make the combined momentum:

m * v_s + m * 1.01 v_s = m (2.01 v_s )

Total mass: 2m.

So the new velocity is (2.01 v_s) / 2 = 1.005 v_s. So that's a 0.5% increase in speed. But the problem says the speed increases by 1%, which doesn't match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the direction.

Wait, maybe the meteor's velocity is in the same direction but higher speed. So the meteor's velocity is v_m = v_s + (0.01 v_s ) = 1.01 v_s. So same as before.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the effect on the satellite's orbit.

The initial situation is a circular orbit. When the satellite's speed increases, it would no longer be in a circular orbit. So the new orbit would either be elliptical, circular, or hyperbolic, depending on the speed.

Wait, the initial speed is v for a circular orbit. The condition for a circular orbit is that the centripetal force provided by gravity equals the required centripetal force for circular motion.

The condition is: (G M m ) / r^2 = m v^2 / r.

So v^2 = G M / r.

So if the satellite's speed increases, then v^2 increases, which implies that r must decrease for the condition to hold. Because if v increases while keeping G M m / r^2 equal to m v^2 / r, then r must decrease. Because for a circular orbit, v depends inversely on r: v = sqrt(GM / r). So higher v (for same M) means smaller r.

So when the satellite's speed increases, it's still in a circular orbit only if it maintains the same velocity. But if the speed increases, perhaps it would move into an elliptical orbit.

Wait, but the problem says the speed increases by 1%, not necessarily maintaining the same velocity. So perhaps the satellite's speed increases, but the direction remains the same. So the satellite would be moving in a circular orbit only if the speed remains the same. But if it increases, then it can't be a circular orbit anymore.

Wait, but in reality, when the speed increases (from the meteor's collision), the satellite isn't going to continue in a circular orbit because the gravitational force would be insufficient for that speed. So the next orbit would be elliptical, with the perigee (closest approach) perhaps at the point P where the meteor hit.

Wait, but the problem says the meteor's collision doesn't change the direction but increases the speed by 1%. So the satellite's speed is now 1.01 times what it was before the collision.

Wait, but before the collision, the speed was v. After the collision, it's 1.01 v. But the direction is the same.

Wait, but that's not possible because for circular orbit, velocity is sqrt(GM/r). If the satellite's speed increases from v to 1.01 v, then the radius must decrease. Because if you increase the orbital speed, the radius decreases.

Because v = sqrt(GM / r), so v² = GM / r. If v increases, v² increases, so r must be smaller to keep the equation balanced.

So, now the satellite has a higher speed. It can't be in a circular orbit anymore. So the orbit must become elliptical, with the perigee (closest point) at the point where the collision happened (point P).

Wait, but the problem says the speed increases by 1%, not necessarily the radius. So the satellite's new orbit would be elliptical, with the semi-major axis determined by the new speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the new speed is 1% higher, and since it's in the same direction, the satellite can't maintain a circular orbit. So the new orbit is an ellipse, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The satellite was moving in a circular orbit with speed v. After the collision, it's moving at a speed v' = 1.01 v, in the same direction. But because its speed is higher than the circular orbit's, it can't stay in a circular orbit. So the new orbit would be an ellipse, with the perigee at point P, and the apogee further away.

Wait, but the question is not about the new speed, but the change in the orbit. So the satellite, after the collision, would have a higher speed than before, but in the same direction. But since the speed is higher than the circular orbit's speed, the satellite's new orbit is an ellipse with the perigee at the point P.

Wait, but the meteor's collision at point P is in the same direction as the satellite's velocity at that point. So the satellite was moving in a circle; the meteor hits the satellite at point P, which is at the farthest point from Earth for the satellite in its orbit.

Wait, but point P is on the perigee of the satellite's orbit. So when the meteor hits the satellite at P, which is the farthest point, the satellite would start moving towards the Earth, which would change its orbit to an elliptical one.

So the new orbit would be an ellipse with the perigee at point P, and the satellite moving closer to Earth, but in the same direction (which would be the same as the Earth's rotation direction, but perhaps that's not the point of consideration here).

Wait, but the direction of the satellite's velocity is tangent to the orbit. So when the satellite is at perigee (farthest from Earth), its velocity is tangent to the orbit, which is in the opposite direction of Earth's rotation. Hmm, but perhaps the direction is considered the same. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is considered the same as the Earth's rotation, but that's not the case.

Wait, no. The direction is the same as the satellite's velocity. The Earth's rotation is a different direction, but in this problem, perhaps the direction is considered the same as the satellite's velocity. So when the satellite is at perigee, it's moving in the direction that is opposite to Earth's rotation, but perhaps we're ignoring that.

Wait, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the direction doesn't matter. The problem says the direction doesn't change, so the satellite's velocity remains in the same direction.

Wait, perhaps the direction refers to the path of the satellite. So the satellite moves in a circle, so the direction (path) remains the same. When the meteor hits the satellite at point P, which is at the farthest point from Earth for the satellite in its orbit, the satellite is moving in the direction that is opposite to Earth's rotation, but perhaps we're ignoring that.

Wait, perhaps the direction refers to the satellite's orbital direction, which is tangential to the orbit, so the direction is the same as the satellite's velocity. So when the satellite is at perigee, its velocity is in the same direction as Earth's rotation, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but point P is on the perigee. So, if the satellite is at perigee, its velocity is directed towards Earth, which is the direction of the Earth's rotation. So perhaps the direction of the satellite's velocity is the same as the Earth's rotation direction, which would have implications for the orbit, but perhaps that's getting too detailed.

In any case, the key point is that the satellite's speed increases by 1% (from v to 1.01 v), but its direction remains the same. Since the satellite's speed is higher than that of a circular orbit at the same radius, the satellite would move into an elliptical orbit with the perigee at point P.

So, the new orbit is an ellipse, with the perigee at point P. So the satellite would start moving towards Earth, but in the same direction as the Earth's rotation. Wait, but if the Earth is rotating eastward, and the satellite is moving eastward, perhaps the perigee is closer to Earth, but I'm not sure about the direction.

Wait, no, the perigee would be the point closest to Earth, but the satellite's speed is higher, so perhaps the perigee is at the point where the meteor hit (point P), and the satellite is moving towards Earth, which would change its orbit to an elliptical one with the perigee at point P.

So the new orbit is an ellipse, with the perigee at point P. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: The original orbit is circular, with speed v. The satellite is in circular orbit: v = sqrt(GM / r). If the speed increases, then r must decrease. So the new orbit is an elliptical orbit, with semi-major axis a, and the perigee distance r_p.

Since after the collision, the satellite's speed is 1.01 v, then v = sqrt(GM / r), so 1.01 v = sqrt(GM / r_p).

So, (1.01)^2 v^2 = GM / r_p.

But v^2 = GM / r, so substituting:

(1.01)^2 (GM / r) = GM / r_p.

Divide both sides by GM:

(1.01)^2 (1/r ) = 1/r_p.

So,

r_p = r / (1.01)^2.

So, the perigee is at a distance r / (1.01)^2 from Earth.

Therefore, the new orbit is elliptical, with the perigee at point P.

So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The satellite is initially in a circular orbit, where its speed and radius satisfy the condition for a stable orbit. When the satellite's speed increases by 1% due to the meteor's collision, the new orbital speed is no longer sufficient for a circular orbit at the same radius. Instead, the satellite enters an elliptical orbit, with the perigee (closest approach) at the point where the meteor hit (point P). 

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition**: The satellite is in a circular orbit with speed \( v \) and radius \( r \), where \( v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} \).

2. **After Collision**: The satellite's speed increases by 1% to \( 1.01v \), but its direction remains the same as the satellite's velocity at point P. Since the satellite's speed is higher than that of a circular orbit at the same radius, it cannot remain in a circular orbit. Instead, it starts moving into an elliptical orbit.

3. **New Orbit**: The new orbit is elliptical with the perigee (closest approach) at point P. The satellite moves toward Earth, altering its orbit to an ellipse. The perigee distance \( r_p \) is given by:
   \[
   r_p = \frac{r}{(1.01)^2}
   \]
   Thus, the satellite's new orbit is an ellipse with the perigee at point P.

### Conclusion:
The satellite's new orbit is an ellipse with the perigee at point P.
