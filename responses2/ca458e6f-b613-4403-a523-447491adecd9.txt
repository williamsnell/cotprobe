Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a first-order reaction with a half-life of 34 minutes. I need to find the rate constant from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that for first-order reactions, the half-life (t₁/₂) is related to the rate constant (k) by the equation t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. Oh wait, but wait—wait, no, I think that's for the first-order. Let me make sure. Oh right, for a first-order reaction, the half-life is (ln 2)/k. Oh yeah, that's the correct formula. So I can rearrange it to solve for k.

So the formula would be k = ln(2) / t₁/₂. But wait, what are the units here? Because the given half-life is in minutes, so the rate constant should have units of per minute. Let's calculate that.

First, ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So 0.693 divided by 34 minutes. Let me compute that: 0.693 /34 is about 0.0204. So 0.0204 min^-1.

Wait, but looking at the options, am I given options in different units? Let me check the options again.

The options are in various units. Let's list them:

Option C is 3.4 × 10^-4 s^-1. Option E is 6.8 ×10^-2 min^-1. Option D is 2.9 ×10^-1 min^-1. Option J is 1.7 ×10^-3 s^-1.

Wait, so my calculation gives about 0.0204 min^-1, which is 2.04 ×10^-2 min^-1. So that would be option E. But wait, looking at the options again, the other options.

Wait, I'm getting 0.0204, which is 2.04e-2 min^-1. Looking at the options, option E is 6.8e-2. Hmm, that's higher than my result. Did I do the math right?

Wait no, wait. Let me double-check. 34 minutes. So 0.693 /34 is approximately 0.0204. So 0.0204 is 2.04e-2. So that would be option E, but wait, option E is 6.8e-2, which is 0.068. That's way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh wait, no—no. For first-order reactions, the half-life is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. So yes, k = ln(2)/t₁/₂.

Wait, but wait. So if 34 minutes is the half-life, and k is in min^-1, that's 0.693 /34 = 0.0204 min^-1, which is 2.04e-2 min^-1. So that's 0.0204 per minute. So looking at the options, option E is 6.8e-2 min^-1, which is 0.068. That's more than double what I'm getting. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 0.693 divided by 34.

Let me compute 34 into 0.693.

34 × 0.02 = 0.68. So 0.02 is 0.68. 0.693-0.68=0.013. So 0.013 /34 is approximately 0.000382. So total is 0.02 + 0.000382 = 0.020382. So approximately 0.0204, which is 2.04e-2. So that's 0.0204 per minute.

Looking at the options again, option E is 6.8e-2, which is 0.068, double. Option G is 1.02e-1 min^-1, which is 0.102. Option F is 6.8e-4 s^-1. Wait, that can't be right because the half-life is in minutes.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the units. Because 34 minutes is a large half-life. Let me think: for a first-order reaction, the half-life is inversely proportional to the rate constant. So a larger half-life means a smaller k.

So if 34 minutes is the half-life, the rate constant should be small. So options G and J are min^-1, so option G is 0.102 min^-1, which is larger than what I got. Option J is 0.0017 s^-1. But 0.0017 is way bigger than 0.0204. So that's not right.

Wait, but perhaps I should convert the half-life to seconds. Because the options include s^-1. Let me try that.

So 34 minutes is 34 *60=2040 seconds. So t₁/₂ =2040 s.

Then, k = ln(2)/t₁/₂ =0.693 /2040 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.693/2040 ≈ 0.000340 per second. Which is 3.4e-4 s^-1. So that's option C.

Wait, that's an option. So, but wait, earlier calculation gave 0.02 min^-1, which is 2.04e-2 min^-1. So that would be 0.02 min^-1, which is 1.2e-2 s^-1 (since 1 min is 60 s), so 0.02 min^-1 *60 s/min = 1.2 s^-1. But wait, that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct option.

Wait, option E is 6.8e-2 min^-1, which is 0.068 min^-1. That's bigger than my 0.02 min^-1. So that's not matching.

Wait, let me recalculate the calculation using the correct units.

t₁/₂=34 min = 34 *60 = 2040 seconds.

So k = ln(2)/t₁/₂ = 0.693147 / 2040 ≈ 0.000340 s^-1. Which is 3.4e-4 s^-1, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the question says the half-life is 34 minutes. So when I calculate k, it's in per minute units. So 0.0204 min^-1, which is 0.0204 1/minute.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me reevaluate.

Option E is 6.8e-2 min^-1, which is 0.068 per minute. That's 6.8 times larger than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The formula is t_1/2 = ln(2)/k. So solving for k, k= ln(2)/t_1/2.

Wait, but wait—wait a second. Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait. I think I messed up the units. Because when the half-life is given in minutes, but the options have units of per minute or per second, that's conflicting. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the rate constant is in per minute, but the options' units don't match. Let's see.

Wait, the formula for first-order reactions is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. Units-wise, t₁/₂ is in time units (like minutes), k is in per time unit (like per minute). So if t is in minutes, k is per minute.

So, if k is in per minute, then 0.0204 min^-1 is correct, which is 0.0204 per minute. So looking at the options, I don't see that.

Wait, let me check the options:

Option E: 6.8 ×10^-2 min^-1 → 0.068 per minute.

Option C: 3.4e-4 s^-1 → 0.00034 per second. Which is 0.0204 per minute, since 60 seconds per minute.

Wait, maybe I should express option C in per minute. Because 3.4e-4 s^-1 is per second. To get per minute, multiply by 60.

3.4e-4 s^-1 *60 s/min = 3.4 *6e-3 → 2.04e-2 per minute. Which is 0.0204 min^-1. So that's the same as what I calculated earlier.

So the correct rate constant is 0.0204 min^-1, which is 2.04e-2 min^-1. Looking at the options, option E is 6.8e-2 min^-1, which is 0.068 per minute, which is about 3.4 times higher than our calculated value.

Wait, that can't be right. What's the problem here?

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula. Oh wait! Wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me double-check. For a first-order reaction, the correct equation is:

ln(2) = kt.

So k = ln(2)/t. So units:

t in same units as k. So if t is in minutes, k is per minute.

So, calculation gives 0.693 /34 ≈ 0.0204 per minute.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.8e-2 min^-1. That's 0.068 per minute, which is 3.38 times higher than our value. So why is that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 0.693 divided by 34.

34 into 0.693. 34 * 0.02 =0.68.

So 0.693 minus 0.68 is 0.013. 0.013 /34 is approximately 0.000382.

So 0.02 + 0.000382 = 0.020382. So 0.020382 per minute. So approximately 0.0204 per minute.

So 0.0204 per minute is 2.04e-2 per minute. So in the options, which option is 2.04e-2 min^-1?

Looking again:

Option E: 6.8 ×10^-2 min^-1 → 0.068 min^-1.

But that's larger than what I am getting. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is asking for k in s^-1? Oh wait, no. Because the half-life is given in minutes. So perhaps I need to convert the half-life into seconds to find the correct k.

Wait, if the half-life is 34 minutes, that's 34 *60 = 2040 seconds. So then k = ln(2)/2040 ≈ 0.693147 /2040 → let me compute that.

0.693147 /2040 = approximately: 0.0003401 per second.

Which is 3.401e-4 s^-1. Looking at the options, option C is 3.4e-4 s^-1. So that's 3.4e-4.

Wait, but according to my calculation, that's correct. So then why earlier when I calculated in minutes I got a different value.

Wait, so in the problem statement, it says the half-life is 34 minutes. So, but the options' units vary. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I don't see it. Because 6.8e-2 min^-1 is 0.068 min^-1, which is 6.8 *60 = 408 per second, which is 408 s^-1. That's way higher than 0.02 per minute.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me go back.

The correct formula is t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k. So k = ln(2)/t₁/₂.

Given t₁/₂ =34 minutes, k = 0.693147 /34 → about 0.0204 per minute.

Which is 0.0204 min^-1. Now, looking at the options:

Option B: 34 min → that's the half-life, but that's not the rate constant.

Option C: 3.4e-4 s^-1 → which is 0.00034 per second, which is 0.0204 per minute. So wait, in my calculation, 3.4e-4 s^-1 is 0.0204 per minute. So that would be option C.

Wait a minute, but the options include option E as 6.8e-2 min^-1. Which is 0.068 per minute. That's 6.8 times higher than 0.0204.

Hmm, so why am I getting conflicting results?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using t₁/₂ in minutes, but the options have s^-1. So I may have to convert the rate constant into s^-1.

Wait, let's compute that. If k is 0.0204 per minute, and 1 minute is 60 seconds, then k in s^-1 is 0.0204/60 = 0.00034 per second, which is 3.4e-4 s^-1, which is option C.

So my calculation gives k=3.4e-4 s^-1, which is option C.

But then, why is option E present as 6.8e-2 min^-1? Because that would be 6.8 per minute. But in my calculation, it's 0.0204 per minute, which is way lower.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the units again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is t₁/₂ = ln(2) * (k)^-1. So if the half-life is given in minutes, and the rate constant is per minute, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the options are correct, and the question is expecting an answer in s^-1.

Wait, let me recompute using seconds.

t₁/₂ =34 minutes = 34 *60=2040 seconds.

k = ln(2)/(2040) ≈0.693147 /2040 → calculate it accurately.

0.693147 / 2040.

Let me compute 2040 into 0.693147.

Hmm, 2040 is 2.04e3. So 0.693147 ÷2.04e3 → 0.693147 /2.04= approx 0.3383. So 0.3383e-3 → 3.383e-4 s^-1. Which is about 3.4e-4 s^-1, option C.

So my calculation in seconds says that the rate constant is approximately 3.4e-4 s^-1, which is option C.

But the problem is that the original t₁/₂ is given in minutes. So perhaps the options are in s^-1, and the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but then why does option E have 6.8e-2 min^-1? That's 0.068 per minute, which is higher than what I got. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because my calculation in minutes gives me 0.0204 per minute, which is 2.04e-2 per minute, and in seconds it's 3.4e-4 per second.

Wait, so the correct answer must be option C, which is 3.4e-4 s^-1. Because that's what I get when I convert 34 minutes to seconds.

So the options are:

Option C: 3.4e-4 s^-1.

Wait, but the question is about the rate constant, which is in s^-1. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again: because the question states that the half-life is 34 minutes. So the correct formula is t₁/₂= ln2/k. So k= ln2/t₁/₂.

So t₁/₂ is 34 minutes. So k= 0.693147 /34 = 0.0204 per minute. But the options are in s^-1, so I need to convert.

So 0.0204 per minute is 0.0204 /60 per second → 0.00034 per second. Which is 3.4e-4 s^-1. So option C.

So the correct answer is C. So looking at the options, option C is 3.4e-4 s^-1.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start with the relationship for a first-order reaction, where the half-life \( t_{1/2} \) is given by:

\[
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{k}
\]

Rearranging for \( k \), we get:

\[
k = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( k \) in units of per minute
Given \( t_{1/2} = 34 \, \text{minutes} \), we substitute into the formula:

\[
k = \frac{\ln(2)}{34} \approx \frac{0.693}{34} \approx 0.0204 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Convert \( k \) to units of per second
Since \( 1 \, \text{minute} = 60 \, \text{seconds} \), we convert \( k \) from per minute to per second:

\[
k = 0.0204 \, \text{min}^{-1} \times 60 \, \text{s/min} = 1.224 \, \text{s}^{-1} \approx 1.22 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

However, the question asks for the rate constant in \( \text{s}^{-1} \), but the half-life is given in minutes. Therefore, we proceed to calculate \( k \) in \( \text{s}^{-1} \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( k \) in \( \text{s}^{-1} \)
Given \( t_{1/2} = 34 \, \text{minutes} = 34 \times 60 = 2040 \, \text{seconds} \), we substitute into the formula:

\[
k = \frac{\ln(2)}{2040} \approx \frac{0.693}{2040} \approx 0.00034 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

This simplifies to approximately \( 3.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s}^{-1} \).

### Step 4: Match with the options
The options are:
- **A**: \( 1.7 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{min}^{-1} \) (incorrect units)
- **B**: \( 34 \, \text{min} \) (half-life, not the rate constant)
- **C**: \( 3.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)
- **D**: \( 2.9 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)
- **E**: \( 6.8 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{min}^{-1} \) (incorrect units)

The correct answer is **C**, as it matches the calculated value of \( k \) in \( \text{s}^{-1} \).

ANSWER: C
