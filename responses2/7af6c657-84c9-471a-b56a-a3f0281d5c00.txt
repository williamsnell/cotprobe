The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investmentsâ€¦The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny."
Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965

Alright, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about foreign investment and its effects. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph of the provided text. The paragraph talks about non-alignment, which involves cooperation between non-aligned states, including capitalist ones. It discusses how foreign investments are made under a national plan, not focusing solely on returns, but on power dynamics. Also, it's mentioned that a State in neo-colonialism isn't master of its own destiny.

Now, the question is asking which of the options would most directly result from this foreign investment. The options are A to D.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers. Hmm, that sounds like something that might happen if the investment is used to establish power structures. But the paragraph doesn't talk about control; it's more about cooperation and not directly implying control.

Option B: Successful democratic regimes in targets. I'm not sure. The paragraph doesn't mention anything about democratization or successful regimes. It's more about state alignment and foreign investment.

Option C: Development of globalization and spread of culture through consumerism. Oh, that's a strong point. Globalization is the process of increasing international cooperation through trade and the internet. If foreign investment is allowed and used to develop other countries, it could lead to globalization. Also, consumerism is part of globalization as people buy more from other regions.

Option D: Reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies. This seems related to the first part of the paragraph, which talks about the struggle against neo-colonialism. But the question is about foreign investment, so D might not be the direct result.

Wait, the paragraph mentions that the foreign investment is part of a non-aligned policy, focusing on a national plan. So, this foreign investment would be used to build infrastructure, education, technology, etc., leading to better development and possibly more cooperation. But the question is about the direct result of this investment.

Looking again, the paragraph says that foreign investment isn't focused on returns but on power. That suggests that the investments are for the good of the country, maybe for development or cooperation. So, that could lead to progress in areas like education, technology, and infrastructure, potentially leading to global cooperation and possibly more global integration, which is part of globalization.

Option C is about globalization and spread of culture through consumerism. That seems like a consequence of investing in other countries, both for development and for global cooperation. So, I think option C is the most direct result.

The foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph would most directly result in the development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism. This is because the investment is part of a non-aligned policy aimed at fostering cooperation and development, which can drive global cooperation and cultural exchange.

**Answer: C**
