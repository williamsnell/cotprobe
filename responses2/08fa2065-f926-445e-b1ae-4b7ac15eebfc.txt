Question:

The dorsal root of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat is severed. How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

Options:

A: Severing the ventral root results in loss of motor function, but sensation remains intact.
B: Severing the dorsal root causes hyperactivity in movement, while severing the ventral root leads to increased sensation.
C: Severing the dorsal root will lead to loss of sensation and reflex action, but if the ventral root is severed, the rat would sense the stimulation but would not be able to react.
D: Severing the dorsal root has no impact on sensation or motor function, while severing the ventral root causes tremors.
E: Severing the dorsal root won't have an effect
F: Severing the dorsal root causes a loss of motor function, whereas severing the ventral root has no effect on the rat.
G: Both the dorsal and ventral root severing lead to enhanced reflex actions.
H: Severing either root causes paralysis
I: Severing the dorsal root results in enhanced sensation, but severing the ventral root causes complete paralysis.
J: Severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation

Okay, so I need to figure out how severing the dorsal root versus the ventral root affects a rat. Let me start by recalling what I know about nerve roots and their roles in nerves.

The question is about a nerve leading to the leg. The roots involved are the dorsal root and the ventral root. I remember that the ventral root is closer to the muscle fiber, while the dorsal root is closer to the nerve endings, which are responsible for sensation.

If the dorsal root is severed, that means we're removing the sensation part. So the nerve wouldn't send signals that cause sensation in the muscles. Without sensation, the animal can't react or move. So, the motor function would be lost, but sensation remains intact. Because if you can't sense anything, you can't even feel things, but since the question is about the leg, the main effect is loss of motor function. So, in this case, the effects would be loss of motor function but sensation remains.

Now, if the ventral root is severed, that would affect the nerve's ability to send signals to the muscles. I think the ventral root is closer to where the muscles are located. So, if you remove that root, the signal doesn't reach the muscles. This would cause the animal to lose sensation, but it would still be able to sense things because the nerve endings are still there. So, in this scenario, sensation remains, but motor function is lost.

Wait, but the options are about the effect. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Severs the ventral root leads to loss of motor function, but sensation remains. That fits with what I was thinking. Because if the ventral root is severed, the nerve can't send signals to the muscles, so no movement. But since the nerve endings are still there, the animal can still feel things (sensation remains).

Option B: Severs the dorsal root causes hyperactivity in movement, which probably isn't right because the stimulation would be lost, so movement wouldn't happen. Also, the ventral root would cause increased sensation. Wait, no, because if the ventral root is severed, the sensation would decrease because the nerve endings are gone. So option B says the ventral root causes increased sensation, which is wrong.

Option C: Severs the dorsal root leads to loss of sensation and reflex action. No, because the ventral root affects the nerve endings, so no loss of sensation. Also, no reflex if there's no motor function.

Option D: Severs the dorsal root has no effect on sensation, but severing the ventral causes tremors. No, because if the ventral is severed, the movement is lost, so tremors (which are related to movement) would happen.

Option E: Severs the dorsal leads to no effect. No, that's incorrect because if the root is severed, motor function would be lost.

Option F: Severs the dorsal leads to loss of motor function. Yes. Severs the ventral would prevent sensation.

Wait, the question is about the effect of severing the roots on the rat. So the options are comparing the two severings.

So, the correct effect of each is:

- If the dorsal root is severed: loss of sensation, but motor function remains (so movement is lost, but sensation is okay).

- If the ventral root is severed: loss of motor function, but sensation remains.

Looking at the options, option A states: "Severing the ventral root results in loss of motor function, but sensation remains intact." That's correct.

So the answer should be option A.

The question examines the effects of severing the dorsal and ventral roots of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat. The ventral root is closer to the muscle fiber, while the dorsal root is closer to the nerve endings responsible for sensation. 

When the **dorsal root** is severed, the nerve loses its ability to send signals for sensation but retains its ability to send signals for motor function (movement). This results in the loss of sensation but the preservation of motor function.

When the **ventral root** is severed, the nerve loses its ability to send signals for motor function but retains its ability to send signals for sensation. This leads to the loss of motor function but the preservation of sensation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that severing the ventral root causes loss of motor function while sensation remains intact.
- **Option B** is incorrect because severs of the ventral root do not cause increased sensation; instead, it causes loss of sensation.
- **Option C** is incorrect because severs of the ventral root do not cause loss of sensation or reflex action.
- **Option D** is incorrect because severs of the ventral root cause loss of motor function, not tremors.
- **Option E** is incorrect because severs of the dorsal root do not have no effect on sensation or motor function.
- **Option F** is incorrect because severs of the dorsal root do cause loss of motor function but not sensation.
- **Option G** and **Option H** are incorrect because they describe unrelated effects.
- **Option I** is incorrect because severs of either root do not cause paralysis.
- **Option J** is incorrect because severs of the ventral root do not cause loss of sensation.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately describes the effects of severing the ventral root.

**ANSWER: A**
