Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?

Options:

A: It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.
B: It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.
C: It goes against the spirit of the Twenty-fourth Amendment by effectively imposing a "literacy tax."
D: It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.
E: It violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating write-in candidates differently.
F: It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.
G: It unreasonably limits the means by which a candidate can campaign, infringing on democratic practices.
H: It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.
I: It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.
J: It interferes with the right to vote as guaranteed by the Nineteenth Amendment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this constitutional law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a state statute requiring candidates to write their names and office on the ballot in ink, in a specific space. A campaign manager is using tears off stickers to do this. But the problem is that many German voters can't read or write English well, so they're having trouble applying the stickers.

The state has already notified the candidate's campaign committee that the stickers don't meet the state's requirements. The campaign filed a suit against the officials, claiming the state's interpretation is wrong under the U.S. Constitution.

The question is about which constitutional argument the candidate can make against this. The options are A to J, each addressing different constitutional issues.

First, I need to recall the key aspects of the U.S. Constitution, especially regarding literacy tests and voting rights. The 14th Amendment abolished literacy tests in 1924, but I think the 19th Amendment abolished the right to vote in 1920. The 19th Amendment also abolished the literacy test in 1927, which was passed after the statute was enacted.

Wait, in the scenario, the state statute adds that candidates must write their names in ink on the ballot. So, the state is now requiring that all write-in candidates include their name in ink. The campaign manager is using tears off, which are usually inked, so that could be a problem.

But the important part is the interpretation of the statute. The candidate's campaign is arguing that the state is interpreting the statute in a way that's too restrictive, possibly even an unconstitutional interpretation.

The options are about what constitutional arguments they can make. Let me think about each option.

Option A: It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack proficiency in English. The candidate's campaign is arguing that German voters can't write the name, so the state's interpretation is unreasonable. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest argument. The First Amendment is about freedom of speech, so the argument that the state's interpretation is unreasonable because it's against their right to write in English.

Option B: Unreasonably interferes with the 15th Amendment. The 15th Amendment was about literacy tests being abolished, but the state statute is adding another requirement. The state's approach might be too restrictive, so the candidate might argue that it's interfering with the 15th Amendment. But isn't the 15th Amendment about state literacy tests, not the write-in candidates? So maybe B is not the strongest argument.

Option C: Imposes a "literacy tax." This is about the state imposing a literacy test. The 24th Amendment is about literacy tests in 1965, but in this case, the state statute is adding another requirement. So the argument that it's a literacy tax would be in line with the 24th Amendment, but the question is whether it's a "literacy tax" in the way it's being applied here.

Option D: Unreasonably discriminates against non-English speakers. The campaign manager is arguing that German voters can't read the name, so the state's interpretation is wrong. So this is similar to Option A, but more about non-English speakers. The argument is that the state's interpretation is unconstitutional because it's treating non-English speakers differently, which is covered by the First Amendment's right to express yourself.

Option E: Interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The 1965 Act is about literacy tests, so if the state is adding another requirement, that might be seen as interfering. But the argument is that the interpretation is unconstitutional because it's about the candidates' writing, which is separate from the act itself.

Option F: Unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates. The state statute requires write-in candidates to write their name and office. The campaign claims the state's interpretation is wrong, so the candidate could argue that it's a discrimination against non-write-in candidates, but no, the candidates are all writing, so that's a stretch.

Option G: Limits campaign efficiency. The argument is that limiting the way candidates can campaign could interfere with democratic practices. But the issue is about the interpretation of the statute, not the actual practice.

Option H: Unreasonably restricts freedom of speech. The First Amendment says you can express your opinion. The state statute requires write-in candidates to write in ink. The campaign is saying that the state is interpreting the statute in a way that's against their right to express English, so their argument is that the interpretation is unreasonable. This is similar to Option A and D, but more about freedom of speech.

Option I: Unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The 1965 Act was about literacy tests, so the state statute's addition might be seen as a violation. But the argument here is that the state's interpretation is wrong.

Option J: Interferes with the 19th Amendment. The 19th Amendment abolished the literacy test, so the state statute is adding another requirement. The argument would be that it's an unreasonable burden, possibly on non-English speakers. But I'm not sure if that's the strongest.

Let me recap. The state statute requires candidates to write their names in ink. The campaign says this is too restrictive, so the state's interpretation is wrong. The strongest argument would be that the state's interpretation under the 14th Amendment is unconstitutional because it's treating candidates differently.

Wait, the 14th Amendment abolished literacy tests in 1924. The state statute is adding another requirement, which might be seen as an unconstitutional literacy test. The argument is that the state's interpretation of the statute is too restrictive, and thus it's a literacy test which is unconstitutional.

Looking at the options, Option C says it's a literacy tax. But the 24th Amendment was about literacy tests in 1965, and the statute here is a new requirement, not an addition in 1965. So Option C might not be correct. Option H is about freedom of speech, which is covered by the First Amendment.

The candidate's argument would be that the state is incorrectly interpreting the statute, which is a violation of the First Amendment's right to express yourself. So the strongest argument would be Option D or H.

Wait, the statute requires write-in candidates to write their name. The candidate's campaign is arguing that the state is interpreting this in a way that's against their right to write in English. So the argument is that the state's interpretation is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

Looking at the options, Option D says "It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general." The campaign manager is talking about German voters, which are non-English speakers. So D is about non-English speakers, which fits.

Option H says it unreasonably restricts freedom of speech. That's a different angle, but perhaps it's a stronger argument. Because the state's statute is adding another requirement, it's a new literacy test, which could fall under the scope of the First Amendment. So the argument that it's a literacy test is covered by the 24th Amendment, but the argument here is that the state's interpretation is wrong, which could be seen as a First Amendment violation.

So the strongest argument would be Option D or H.

Wait, another angle: the 14th Amendment abolished literacy tests in 1924. The state statute might be adding another requirement, which is a literacy test, hence the "literacy tax" in Option C. But I think the argument here is against the interpretation of the statute, not the statute itself.

Alternatively, the argument could be that the state's interpretation of the statute is unconstitutional because it's too restrictive, which would be a First Amendment issue.

So, which is stronger? The argument that the state's interpretation is wrong would be more about the validity of the statute's requirements. The argument that it's a literacy tax would be about the constitutional framing of the statute.

But which is a stronger argument? I think the argument that the state's interpretation is wrong would be a First Amendment argument because it's about the right to write in English. The literacy tax argument is more about the statute's framing and not the actual content.

So, the strongest argument would be that the state's interpretation is unreasonable, which would be an argument against the First Amendment. The candidates are arguing that the state is interpreting the statute in a way that's against their right to express in English, thus violating the First Amendment.

Looking back at the options, the candidates' argument is that the state's interpretation is wrong, which would be an argument against the 14th Amendment, which abolished literacy tests in 1924. But I think the strongest argument is that the state's interpretation is wrong, which is about the First Amendment.

Wait, the options:

Option D: It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.
Option H: Unreasonably restricts freedom of speech.

The candidate's argument is that the state's interpretation is wrong, which is about the First Amendment. So the strongest argument is that it's a violation of the First Amendment, which would be Option D or H? Wait, the First Amendment is about the right to express yourself, so the argument that the state is interpreting it in a way that's against that right would be Option D.

Alternatively, the argument that the statute is a literacy tax (Option C) is a different issue.

Wait, but the statute's content is a new requirement, so the argument is that the state's interpretation is wrong, not that it's a literacy tax.

So the strongest argument is that the state is interpreting the statute in a way that's against their right to write in English, which is the First Amendment. So the correct answer would be Option D.

Wait, but the question is about what the candidate can make against the state's interpretation, which is an argument against the statute. So the strongest argument would be that the state's interpretation is unreasonable, which is a First Amendment issue.

Looking at the options again, the strongest argument is likely Option D: It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.

Wait, but the candidate is arguing that the state's interpretation is wrong, not that the state's interpretation is a literacy tax. So Option C is about a literacy tax, which is a separate issue.

Wait, the problem is that the candidate's argument is that the state's interpretation is wrong, which is about the right to express yourself. So that would be Option D.

Alternatively, the state statute is a new literacy requirement, so the argument that it's unconstitutional under the First Amendment would be Option D. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: The statute requires write-in candidates to write their name, which is a new requirement. The campaign's argument is that the state is interpreting this in a way that's against their right to write in English. So the strongest argument is that the state's interpretation is unconstitutional, which would be an argument against the First Amendment.

Looking for that in the options, I think the correct answer is D: It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.

Alternatively, the argument could be that it's a literacy test, which falls under the 24th Amendment, but the argument here is about the First Amendment right to express yourself.

Wait, the 24th Amendment was about literacy tests in 1965. The statute here is a new requirement, so it's not the same as the 24th Amendment.

Wait, perhaps the strongest argument is that the state's interpretation is against their right to write in English, which is Option D.

Alternatively, the argument could be that the state is imposing a literacy test that's unconstitutional, which would be Option C.

But the argument in the question is that the state is interpreting the statute in a way that's against their right to write in English. So that's about their right to express themselves, which is the First Amendment.

So the correct answer is Option D.
</think>

To address the question, we need to identify the strongest constitutional argument the candidate can make against the state's interpretation of the statute. The statute requires candidates to write their names and office on a ballot in ink, which the campaign manager argues is too restrictive and unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The candidate's argument centers on the interpretation of the statute, suggesting that the state is treating non-English speakers differently, thereby violating their right to write in English.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Suggests discrimination against German voters due to proficiency in English. While relevant, it focuses on non-English speakers rather than the First Amendment's right to express yourself.
- **Option B**: Argues interference with the 15th Amendment. Incorrect, as the 15th Amendment was about literacy tests, not the write-in candidates.
- **Option C**: Proposes a literacy tax. This is about imposing a tax, which is a separate issue from the statute's requirements.
- **Option D**: Emphasizes unreasonably discriminating against non-English speakers. This aligns with the candidate's argument that the state's interpretation is against their right to express in English, a First Amendment issue.
- **Option E**: Interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Incorrect, as the statute's content is a new requirement.
- **Option F**: Argues discrimination against write-in candidates. Unrelated to the statute's requirements.
- **Option G**: Limits campaign efficiency. Incorrect, as the argument is about interpreting the statute, not campaign practices.
- **Option H**: Interroduces a literacy restriction. This is about restricting literacy tests, not the statute's requirements.
- **Option I**: Interferes with the 1965 Act. Incorrect, as the statute's addition is a new requirement.
- **Option J**: Interferes with the 19th Amendment. Incorrect, as the amendment was about literacy tests, not the statute.

### Conclusion:
The strongest argument is that the state's interpretation is unreasonable, specifically targeting the First Amendment's right to express yourself. This is best captured by **Option D**.
