Okay, so I need to figure out which country had the lowest life expectancy in 2019 based on the options provided. Let me start by recalling some general knowledge about life expectancy in different regions around the world.

First, I know that life expectancy is generally higher in developed countries. So, countries with lower life expectancies are likely in regions that are developing or have lower income levels. 

Looking at the options, I see countries like Australia, Japan, the United States, Canada, Iran, Germany, Brazil, Russia, China, and Mexico. I'm trying to remember the life expectancies for these. 

I think Japan had a very high life expectancy because they have a well-developed healthcare system. Similarly, Australia had decent life expectancies, as did the United States. Canada's life expectancy might be lower than some other developed nations, but I'm not entirely sure.

Germany, on the other hand, I believe had a life expectancy that was lower than the others. Wait, but among the options, Iran is mentioned, but I think Iran's life expectancy was actually quite high because of their healthcare system. 

Looking at the options, among the listed, Germany and Japan have higher life expectancies. So the lower ones might be Australia, Canada, Brazil, the United States, Mexico, and China. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. I remember that in 2019, Japan had a life expectancy around 80 years, Australia around 79, the United States around 78, and Canada around 80. So maybe the lowest among those is China and Mexico. 

But what about China? I think China's life expectancy was around 75 or so, but I'm not certain. Let me try to recall specific data points. For example, China's life expectancy in 2019 was about 75.2 years. 

Looking at the options, China is listed as option I. So that would be the lowest life expectancy among the options given. 

Wait, but I also recall that Canada had a life expectancy around 80 in 2019, so that's not the lowest. So the options are Australia (79), Canada (80), Germany (around 77), Japan (around 80), Iran (80), Brazil (around 75), the United States (around 78), Mexico (around 76), Russia (around 73), and China (around 75). 

So the lowest among these would be Russia (73), China (75), and Mexico (76), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think I might have mixed up the data. Let me try to get this straight.

In 2019, according to the United Nations and other sources, Brazil had a life expectancy of around 75 years. Canada was around 80, the United States around 78, Australia around 79, Japan around 80, Germany around 77, Iran around 80, the United States again 78, China around 75, Mexico around 76, and Russia around 73. 

So the lowest would be Russia (73). But wait, I'm not sure if I'm correct about China. I think China's life expectancy is higher than some others. Let me think again: China's life expectancy in 2019 was around 75.2. So it's higher than Mexico's 76? No, no. Wait, 76 is higher than 75.2. So China is lower than Mexico. 

So the lowest life expectancy would be Russia (73), China (75.2), and then Mexico (76). But wait, the options include both China and Mexico. So the lowest is Russia and China. However, when looking at the options, which one is the answer? The question asks which had the lowest, so all of these would be correct, but the options are single letters.

Wait, looking back, the options are A through J. So the options available are each country. So in the given options, the lowest life expectancy would be Russia (H) and China (I). 

But wait, the question is which had the LOWEST. So the answer could be either Russia or China, or perhaps another country like Brazil or Mexico? But according to my data, Brazil is 75, which is higher than China's 75.2. So the lowest would be Russia (73) and China (75.2). 

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting data. Maybe I should double-check.

Wait, I think I confused the countries. Let me try to get accurate info. 

From the latest data, in 2019, life expectancy for each country:

- Brazil: about 75.3 years
- China: around 75.2 years
- Mexico: about 75.8 years
- Japan: 80.0 years
- Germany: 77.5 years
- Australia: 79.0 years
- Canada: 80.0 years
- the United States: 78.0 years
- Iran: 80.0 years
- Russia: 73.0 years

So the lowest is Russia (73), then China (75.2), followed by Brazil (75.3), and then Mexico (75.8). 

So the lowest is Russia. But wait, looking back at the options, the answer options are the countries listed, so the correct answer is H (Russia). 

Wait, but the options as given in the question are:

A: Australia
B: Japan
C: United States
D: Canada
E: Iran
F: Germany
G: Brazil
H: Russia
I: China
J: Mexico

So the answer is H, Russia, because it's the one with the lowest life expectancy in 2019.

The country with the lowest life expectancy in 2019 from the given options is Russia (H).

Answer: H
