Okay, so I have this question about the hydrolysis constant of the bicarbonate ion, HCO3^-. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let's try to work through it.

The question is asking for an expression for K_h(HCO3^-) using only two given parameters: the first dissociation constant of H2CO3, which is K_a1, and the water constant K_W. The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that bicarbonate is a buffer because it's a weak acid that can hydrolyze in water. So, the hydrolysis reaction would be something like HCO3^- + H2O ↔ H2CO3 + OH^-. Or wait, wait, maybe I'm getting that backwards. Or perhaps it's HCO3^- reacting with H2O to form H2CO3 and OH^- ions. Or maybe it's the other way around: bases. Wait, no, HCO3^- is a weak acid. So when it reacts with water, it can either donate or accept protons. Wait, no, HCO3^- is a conjugate base of H2CO3, so maybe it can act as a base.

Wait, the hydrolysis of HCO3^- would produce CO3^2- and H+ or OH^-? Let me think. HCO3^- is the conjugate base of H2CO3. So when HCO3^- is in solution, it can react with H2O to form H2CO3 and OH^- (since HCO3^- is a weak base). Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

H2CO3 is a weak acid, so it dissociates as H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3^-. The bicarbonate ion (HCO3^-) is the conjugate base of H2CO3. So when HCO3^- is in solution, it can undergo hydrolysis. The hydrolysis reaction would be HCO3^- + H2O ↔ H2CO3 + OH^-. So the equilibrium for this reaction is the hydrolysis constant K_h, which is the base dissociation constant for HCO3^-.

Wait, the hydrolysis constant K_h is [H2CO3][OH^-] / [HCO3^-]. Alternatively, since it's a base, it can be expressed as Kb = [BH+][OH^-] / [B], where B is the base and BH+ is the conjugate acid. So for HCO3^-, the Kb is K_w / K_a1, since HCO3^- + H2O ↔ H2CO3 + OH^-. So Kb = Kw / K_a1. Therefore, K_h = Kw / K_a1.

Wait, but let me double-check that. The hydrolysis of HCO3^- is HCO3^- + H2O → H2CO3 + OH^-. So Kb would be [H2CO3][OH^-] / [HCO3^-]. But H2CO3 is a weak acid, and [H2CO3] is equal to Kw / K_a1. Because, for H2CO3, the acid dissociation is H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3^-. So K_a1 = [H+][HCO3^-]/[H2CO3]. So [H2CO3] = K_a1 * [HCO3^-]/[H+]. But [H+] is related to Kw because Kw = [H+][OH^-] = K_w. But perhaps I'm complicating this.

Wait, another approach. The hydrolysis reaction HCO3^- + H2O ↔ H2CO3 + OH^- has a base dissociation constant Kb. So Kb = [H2CO3][OH^-] / [HCO3^-]. But the H2CO3 is the conjugate acid of HCO3^-, so [H2CO3] = K_a1 * [HCO3^-]/[H+]. Hmm, but [H+] is Kw / [OH^-], so maybe substituting that in.

Wait, another angle. The hydrolysis of HCO3^- is a base because HCO3^- can accept a proton to become H2CO3. So Kb = [H2CO3][OH^-] / [HCO3^-]. Now, considering that H2CO3 is a weak acid and that in solution, the concentration of H2CO3 is Kw / K_a1 (since K_a1 = [H+][HCO3^-]/[H2CO3], so [H2CO3] = K_a1 * [HCO3^-]/[H+]). So substituting into Kb, we get:

Kb = (K_a1 * [HCO3^-]/ [H+]) * [OH^-] / [HCO3^-] = (K_a1 / [H+]) * [OH^-]

But [H+] is Kw / [OH^-], so [OH^-] = Kw / [H+]. Substituting that into the equation:

Kb = (K_a1 / [H+]) * (Kw / [H+]) ) = (K_a1 * Kw) / [H+]^2

But [H+]^2 is Kw, because Kw = [H+][OH^-] = [H+][H+]/[OH^-], wait no, Kw is [H+][OH^-] = [H+]^2 / [H+] = [H+] * [H+]/[OH^-] → wait, no, [H+][OH^-] = Kw, which is [H+]^2 only if [H+] = [OH^-], which is the case for pure water. But in solution, [H+] and [OH^-] are related by Kw, but they aren't necessarily equal.

Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let's think about it differently. The hydrolysis of HCO3^- is a base, so its base dissociation constant is Kb = Kw / K_a1. So if I write K_h (the hydrolysis constant) as Kb, then K_h= Kw / K_a1.

Looking at the options, option H is K_h = (Kw)/{K_a1}, which is Kb. So that's option H.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about what the question is exactly asking. The question says, "Find an expression for the hydrolysis constant of the bicarbonate ion HCO3^-, K_h(HCO3^-), using only the first dissociation constant for H_2CO3, K_a1 (H2CO3), and the water constant, K_W."

So, the options are expressions that don't involve any other constants. So the correct expression should only involve K_a1 and K_W. 

In my earlier thought, Kb = Kw / K_a1. So K_h (the hydrolysis constant) is Kb, so K_h equals Kw divided by K_a1. So option H says that, which is option H: K_h = Kw / K_a1.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is K_h = (K_W)/{K_a1 (H2CO3)}. Wait, the option H is written as K_h = [K_W / K_a1]. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: I'm a bit confused because I thought K_h would be the hydrolysis constant, which is the base dissociation constant. So if HCO3^- hydrolyzes to give H2CO3 and OH^-, then Kb is the same as K_h. So yes, K_h is Kb, which is Kw / K_a1. So option H is the correct one.

Looking at the options, I see option H is K_h = (K_W)/K_a1.

So the correct answer should be option H. Let me check the other options to make sure none of them match.

Option A: (K_W)^2 * K_a1. No, that's not matching.

Option B: [K_W^2]/[K_a1]. No, because K_h is Kb=Kw/K_a1.

Option C: K_a1 / K_W. That would be the reciprocal of Kb, which is the acid dissociation constant, so that's the Ka1, which is not K_h.

Option D: 1/(K_W * K_a1). That's 1/(K_a1 K_w), which would be the reciprocal of Kb. So that's not the hydrolysis constant.

Option E: K_W + K_a1. That's not a valid expression, since they're different constants.

Option F: (K_W K_a1). That's K_a1 multiplied by K_w, which is K_a1 K_w. But K_h is K_w/K_a1. So F is not correct.

Option G: (K_W + K_a1)^2. That's the square of the sum of the two, which doesn't match.

Option I: K_a1 * K_w. That's the same as option D, which is the reciprocal of Kb.

Option J: K_W * K_a1. That's K_a1 K_w, same as I and F.

So the correct option is H: K_h = K_w / K_a1.

The question asks for an expression for the hydrolysis constant of the bicarbonate ion, \( K_h(\text{HCO}_3^-) \), using only the first dissociation constant of \( \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \), \( K_{a1}(\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3) \), and the water constant \( K_W \). 

The hydrolysis of \( \text{HCO}_3^- \) in water can be represented as:

\[
\text{HCO}_3^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{OH}^-
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction, \( K_h \), is known as the hydrolysis constant. Since \( \text{HCO}_3^- \) is the conjugate base of \( \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \), the hydrolysis constant \( K_h \) is equivalent to the base dissociation constant \( K_b \) for \( \text{HCO}_3^- \). The relationship between \( K_b \) and \( K_{a1} \) is given by:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_{a1}}
\]

Here, \( K_w \) is the water constant, and \( K_{a1} \) is the first dissociation constant of \( \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \). Substituting \( K_b \) into the expression for \( K_h \), we find:

\[
K_h = K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_{a1}}
\]

Now, analyzing the options provided:

- **Option A**: \( K_h = K_w^2 K_{a1} \) — Incorrect, as this does not match the derived expression.
- **Option B**: \( K_h = \frac{K_w^2}{K_{a1}} \) — Incorrect, as this represents the reciprocal of \( K_h \), not \( K_h \) itself.
- **Option C**: \( K_h = \frac{K_{a1}}{K_w} \) — Incorrect, as this represents the reciprocal of \( K_h \), not \( K_h \) itself.
- **Option D**: \( K_h = \frac{1}{K_w K_{a1}} \) — Incorrect, as this represents the reciprocal of \( K_h \), not \( K_h \) itself.
- **Option E**: \( K_h = \frac{K_w}{K_{a1}} \) — Correct, as this matches the derived expression.
- **Option F**: \( K_h = K_w K_{a1} \) — Incorrect, as this does not match the derived expression.
- **Option G**: \( K_h = (K_w + K_{a1})^2 \) — Incorrect, as this does not match the derived expression.
- **Option H**: \( K_h = \frac{K_w}{K_{a1}} \) — Correct, as this matches the derived expression.
- **Option I**: \( K_h = K_{a1} K_w \) — Incorrect, as this does not match the derived expression.
- **Option J**: \( K_h = K_w K_{a1} \) — Incorrect, as this does not match the derived expression.

Both **Option H** and **Option E** are mathematically equivalent, but **Option H** is more concise and directly matches the derived expression. Therefore, the correct answer is:
