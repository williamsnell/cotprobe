Answer:

Okay, so I have this question about DNA sequences and mutations. Let me think through it step by step. The question says that a segment of DNA is 5' – GGATCCTCATG – 3', and I need to find which of the given options would result from both a point mutation and a deletion happening to this original sequence.

Hmm, point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide. Deletion means one or more nucleotides are removed. So, both events are happening. Let's see.

The original sequence is 5' – GGATCCTCATG – 3'. Let me write that out to see the exact length. Let's count: G, G, A, T, C, C, T, C, A, T, G. Wait, that's 11 nucleotides. Wait no, that's 11? Let me count again. Wait, wait:

The sequence is 11? Let me count each letter. G, G, A, T, C, C, T, C, A, T, G. Oh wait, no, that's 11 letters. So 11 bases.

Wait, wait, let me check. GGATCCTCATG. Let me count each character:

G G A T C C T C A T G. That's 11 letters. So, 11 bases.

Now, the possible options are sequences of varying lengths. Let's look at each option.

Option A: 5’ – GGATCCTCA – 3’ — that's 9 letters. So, original was 11. So, 2 deletions? But the question says both point mutation and deletion. Hmm, but deleting two would result in a point mutation?

Wait, point mutation is a single change. So, if there's a deletion of one, and a point mutation, the result is a shorter sequence than the original.

So, the original is 11. So any option with length 10 (11-1) would be possible if there's a deletion of one. But wait, wait, also, the point mutation can be anywhere, so the deletion may be in the middle or at the end.

Wait, no, because the original is 11 letters. So when you delete one, it's 10 letters. Or, if you have a mutation in one of the middle letters, then maybe the deletion would have to occur elsewhere, but that's a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the deletion occurs and a point mutation happens. So the sequence would lose one letter, but also have a change in a different position.

Wait, but the question says the result is both a mutation and a deletion. So, for example, the original is 11, after deletion of one, it becomes 10. But the mutation could occur in any of the 11 letters, but if the other part is also 10, then perhaps the deletion and mutation have happened in the same area. Hmm, maybe the sequence has a mutation and then a deletion, but the deletion could have happened before or after.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options to see which ones are possible.

Option A: 9 letters. So that's a deletion of two, but no mutation. So doesn't fit both.

Option B: TGATCCCAG. Let me count: T, G, A, T, C, C, C, A, G. Wait, that's 9 letters. So again, a deletion of two. No mutation. So not matching.

Option C: same as original, so 11 letters. So no change, no mutation. So no.

Option D: 5' – GGATCCTCGT –3' Let me count the letters. G G A T C C T C G T: that's 10 letters? Wait, wait. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me write it: GGATCCTCGT. So each letter.

Letters: G, G, A, T, C, C, T, C, G, T. Oh wait, that's 10 letters. So 11 original, 10 after deletion. So the original was 11, after deleting one, it's 10. So maybe the mutation and a deletion happened in the same position. But wait, the original is 11. So if it's a deletion of one, then the sequence is 10, and a mutation in any of the 10 positions. So this would be possible.

Wait, but the option is D: 5’ – GGATCCTCGT –3’. Let me check the original sequence. The original is 5' – GGATCCTCATG – 3'. So the original is 11 letters. Option D is 5’ – GGATCCTCGT –3’. So the original has, after the first 9 letters, 'CATG' (positions 9-12), and option D starts with 'GGATCCTC' then 'G' and 'T' at the end, which is 10 letters. Wait, but the original ends with 'CATG' (positions 9-12: C A T G). So if the mutation is in position 10, like changing 'T' to 'C' or something. But wait, in option D, the last two letters are 'G' and 'T'? Let me recount:

Option D: 5' – GGATCCTCGT –3'. So the original ends with CATG (positions 9-12 are C A T G). So if the original is 11, this option is 10 letters. So if a mutation happened in position 9, say changing C to A or something, but that would require a deletion elsewhere. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: The original sequence is 11 letters. Let's see the options:

Option H: 5' – GGATCCTCATG –3' — that's 11 letters. So no change, so option H is the same as original. So that's a deletion of zero and no mutation. So no.

Option B: 5’ – TGATCCCAG –3’ — 9 letters. So that's a deletion of two. So no mutation.

Option A: 5’ – GGATCCTCA –3’ — 9 letters. So again, deletion of two.

Option E: 5’ – GGTCCTCATC –3’ — Let me count: G G T C C T C A T C. So 10 letters. So 11 original, so a deletion of one. But wait, option E is 10 letters. So original was 11, so a deletion of one would leave 10, but option E is 10 letters. So a deletion of one would have reduced the length by one. So, if a mutation happened in the original, and a deletion of one, perhaps.

Wait, but the option E is 10 letters, while the original is 11. So perhaps a deletion of one, but where? Because the original is 11 letters, and the option E is 10. So the original would have been 11, and a deletion of one would take it to 10. So if the original had a mutation in one of its letters, say the 11th letter, then a deletion would occur elsewhere. But that would leave the sequence as 10 letters. So the resulting sequence from E would have a mutation and a deletion. Wait, no, because the mutation is in the original, then the deletion would make it 10. So yes, E could be the result of a point mutation (changing one letter) and a deletion of one (removing another letter, perhaps at the end). Wait, no. Because the original is 11 letters. If you delete one, you get 10. The option E is 10 letters. So, for example, the original was 11, and you delete one to get E. But that would mean that E is the result of a deletion of one. But the question says that both a point mutation and a deletion have occurred. So, if the original was 11, and a mutation occurred (changing, say, the 11th letter to something else), then a deletion (say, removing the 11th letter) would result in 10 letters, which is option E. But then E would have had the mutation (which was in the original) and that deletion, but wait, no, the mutation is part of the original, and the deletion is on the original too. So, if you have a mutation (changing a letter) and then a deletion (removing another letter), the result would be a 10-letter sequence. So option E would be the result of a mutation and a deletion, but the original DNA was 11 letters. So, E is a deletion of one (assuming you delete a letter from the end), but the mutation is part of the original, so that's correct. So option E would result from a point mutation (changing a letter in the original) and a deletion (removing the last letter). So that's possible.

Wait, but what about the other options. Let me check.

Option F: 5’ – GGATCCGCATG –3’ — 11 letters. So same as original? No, because the original was CATG at the end. So this is a different sequence. So it's a deletion of two letters. So no, because that's two deletions, no mutation. So F is not correct.

Option G: 5’ – GGATCTCATG –3’ — Let me count: G G A T C T C A T G. Wait, 10 letters. So 11 original, so a deletion of one. But is that a point mutation? Because in the original, the 9th and 10th letters are C and A, but option G is T and C. Hmm, not sure. Maybe a mutation in the original. So if the original was 11, and a mutation changed one of the letters (say, the 9th from C to T), then a deletion of one would give you 10 letters, which is option G. So that's possible.

Wait, no. Because in the original, the last four letters are CATG. Option G is TCATG, so it's a deletion of the first C. So it's a point mutation (changing C to T) and a deletion (removing the first C). So that's possible.

Wait, but in the original, the last four letters are CATG. Option G is TCATG, which is the original without the first C. So that's a deletion of one. So the resulting DNA would be option G, which is a deletion of the first C and a mutation of C to T. So yes, that's a possibility.

Wait, but the original sequence ends with CATG. So, a deletion of one would require removing one letter. If the deletion is at the beginning, it's a deletion of the first C, which would change the last four letters to TCATG.

So option G is a deletion of one (from the first C) and a mutation (from C to T in the original). So yes, that's possible.

Wait, but the original is 11 letters. So, to get option G, you have to delete one letter from the original. So yes, that's possible.

But wait, the original is 11 letters, so any of the 11 could be deleted. So which of the options is a deletion of one and a mutation (changing one letter)?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9 letters. So deletion of two. No.

Option B: 9 letters. Deletion of two. No.

Option C: same as original. No.

Option D: 10 letters (if you delete the last T). So, original is 11 letters. If you delete the last T, then you have 10 letters. So, if you have a mutation in the original (say, the last T becomes C) and a deletion of the last T, the result is 10 letters. So that would be option D.

Wait, but in the original, the last two letters are G and T. So if a mutation changes G to C, and a deletion of the last T, then the result would be GGATCCTC, which is 9 letters. But option D is 10 letters. Hmm, so perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about each option and see whether it's possible that it's the result of a deletion and a point mutation.

Option A: 5' – GGATCCTCA –3’ → 9 letters. So, this would require that one letter was deleted from the original, and a mutation in another letter.

The original has 11 letters. So, if I delete the 10th letter (which is C), and change, say, the 9th letter (T) to A, the result would be GGATCCTCA, which is option A. So this is possible.

But wait, the original DNA has 11 letters. So, if you have a mutation (changing one letter) and a deletion (removing another letter), the result is that the original becomes 10 letters. So A is 9 letters, which is 11-2. So that's not possible.

Wait, but the question says both a point mutation and a deletion have occurred. So, the original must have a mutation and must have had a deletion. So, the result would have 10 letters (original 11 minus one deletion, but if the mutation is in the original, then the mutation could be in the same area as the deletion.)

Wait, perhaps another way: the original has a mutation (changing a letter) and then a deletion (removing another letter from the original). So, the sequence would lose one letter (mutation) and another (deletion). So the result is a 10-letter sequence.

So which of the options is a 10-letter sequence resulting from a mutation in the original and a deletion elsewhere?

Option E is 10 letters. It's 5' – GGTCCTCATC –3’ → let me count: G G T C C T C A T C → 10 letters.

Original is 11 letters. So, to get E, you have to delete one letter from the original. The original ends with CATG. Option E is TCA T C → wait, no, the original ends with CATG, so if you delete the first C, you get T CATG, which is option G.

Alternatively, if you delete the last T, you get G T CATG, but that would be G T C A T G, which is option F.

Hmm, option E is TCA T C → wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it out:

Option E: 5’ – GGTCCTCATC –3’ → letters: G, G, T, C, C, T, C, A, T, C → 10 letters.

So, the original is 11 letters. So, to get 10 letters, you need to delete one letter. Let's see where.

If I delete the first C (position 3 in the original), the sequence becomes G, G, T, C, C, T, C, A, T, G → which is option F (F is 5’ – GGATCCGCATG –3’). So, original 11 letters, delete the first C → 10 letters, which is option F.

But option E is 10 letters, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me re-examine the original and see which option is 10 letters.

Original is 11 letters. Any option with 10 letters is possible only if one letter is deleted from the original.

So, which of the options is 10 letters.

Looking at the options:

Option E is 10 letters. So, let's see: the original ends with CATG. So, if from the original, you delete one letter, you get 10 letters. Let's see:

If you delete the first C, you get G G T C C T C A T G → which is 10 letters. So that's option F.

But option E is G G T C C T C A T C. So how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the letters. Let me write both the original and option E.

Original: 11 letters: G G A T C C T C A T G → letters 1-11.

Option E is 5’ – GGTCCTCATC –3’ → letters 1-10: G G T C C T C A T C.

So, the original is letters 1-11. Option E is letters 1-10. So, the original's letters 1-10 are the same as option E except the 11th letter.

Wait, but that would imply that the original's 11th letter is the 10th in option E. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps when you delete a letter, you get the same as option E.

Wait, but the original ends with CATG. So if you delete the first C, you get G G T C C T C A T G → which is 10 letters. So that's option F.

But option E is 10 letters. Hmm.

Alternatively, if you delete the last letter (G), then you get G G T C C T C A T → 9 letters. No, that's not option E.

Wait, perhaps option E is the result of a mutation in the original and a deletion. Let me think.

The original is 11 letters. Suppose in the original, the 10th letter is C and the 11th is G. So, a mutation could change the 10th C to T. Then, the original has a T in position 10. Then, if a deletion occurs, perhaps deleting the 10th T and the 11th G. But that's not possible because a deletion can only remove one.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each option and whether it could have been formed from a point mutation and deletion.

Option A: 9 letters. Original is 11. So to get 9, you'd have to delete two letters. So, no, because the question says both a mutation and a deletion have occurred. So, no.

Option B: 9 letters. Similarly, deletion of two. No.

Option C: same as original. No mutation. No.

Option D: 10 letters. Original is 11. So, a mutation in one of the letters, and a deletion of one. So, the original is 11 letters. After mutation (changing one letter), you have 11 letters. Then, you delete one letter, resulting in 10 letters. So, D is possible.

Wait, but the original is 11 letters, and option D is 10 letters. So, if you have a mutation (changing a letter) in the original, and then a deletion of one letter, the result is option D (10 letters). So that's possible.

Wait, but I must make sure that the mutation is in the original and that the deletion is another part of the original. So, for example, the original is 11 letters, and the mutation occurs in any one of them. Then, a deletion happens in another letter (could be in the middle or at the end). So, the result is 10 letters.

But looking at the options, option D is 10 letters, and it's 5’ – GGATCCTCGT –3’ → which is the same as deleting the T at position 10 and the G at position 11. So, that's a deletion of two letters. So, that's a deletion of two letters, but the question says a deletion occurred, so it's possible.

Wait, but if the original DNA is 11 letters, and you have a mutation in one of them and then a deletion in another, the result would be 10 letters. So, in that case, option D is a result of a point mutation and a deletion. So that's possible.

So, which option is correct? Let me think again.

The original is 11 letters. The options are 10 letters, except option E is 10 letters as well. Wait, no, option E is 10 letters, but option F is 11 letters. So, the original is 11 letters. So, to get any of the options, you must have deleted one letter.

So, which option can be formed by a mutation in the original and a deletion elsewhere.

Looking at the options, option D is 10 letters, and it's the same as changing a letter in the original and then deleting another. So, for example, the original is 11 letters, and you have a mutation in any one letter (say, changing the 10th C to T), then you delete the 11th G, making it 10 letters. So that's a point mutation and a deletion, leading to option D.

Alternatively, the mutation could be in the original, and then the deletion occurs in the original, changing another letter. So, option D is the result.

But wait, another possibility: the mutation is in the original, and the deletion is in the original as well, but in different positions. So, for example, option D is G G A T C C T C G T → but that's not right. Wait, no. Option D is 10 letters, so it's a mutation in one of the letters and a deletion of another.

So, which option is correct? Let me check each one again.

Option A: 9 letters → deletion of two. No mutation. So, no.

Option B: 9 letters → deletion of two. No mutation. No.

Option C: same as original → no mutation. No.

Option D: 10 letters → mutation in one letter, deletion in another. So yes.

Option E: 10 letters → mutation in one letter, deletion in another? Let me see. The original is 11 letters, so if you have a mutation in one letter, and a deletion in another, you get 10 letters. So, option E is 10 letters. Does that mean that it's the result of a mutation and a deletion?

Option E: 5’ – GGATCCGCATG –3’ → 11 letters. So, same as the original. So, no mutation, so no.

Wait, another way: the original has a mutation (changing a letter) and then a deletion (removing another letter from the original). So, the result is 10 letters. So, any of the options which is 10 letters and is a result of a mutation in the original and a deletion elsewhere would be correct.

So, the original is 11 letters. So, any option that is 10 letters would be a possible result of a mutation and a deletion.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9 letters → no.

Option B: 9 letters → no.

Option C: same as original → no.

Option D: 10 letters → yes.

Option E: 11 letters → no.

Option F: 11 letters → no.

Option G: 10 letters → yes.

Option H: same as original → no.

Option I: same as original → no.

So, options D and G are 10 letters. So, let's see what each of them represents.

Option D: 5’ – GGATCCTCGT –3’ → letters 1-10: G, G, A, T, C, C, T, C, G, T.

Wait, original has 11 letters. So, any of the letters in the original could be altered. So, in option D, the last letter is T, which was the original's T in position 11. So, if that was a mutation, and the deletion is somewhere else, then option D would be correct.

Similarly, option G: 5’ – GGATCCTCATG –3’ → the last two letters are C A T G. So, the original ends with CATG. So, option G is the same as the original but with the last C changed to T. So, that's a mutation, and no deletion. So, that's not correct because the question requires both a mutation and a deletion.

Wait, no. Because in the original, the last letter is G. Option G is T CATG, so it's a mutation of G to T. But then, no deletion. So, that's a mutation only. So, that's not correct.

So, the correct options are D and G. But option G is a mutation only.

So, the only option that is a result of a mutation and a deletion would be option D.

But wait, let me think again. Because from the original, you can have a mutation and a deletion. So, for example, the original is 11 letters. Suppose you change a letter in the original (mutation) to another, and then delete another letter in the original. So, the result is a 10-letter DNA. So, any option that's 10 letters would be correct if it's formed by a mutation and a deletion.

But, in this case, the options are:

A: 9 letters → no.

B: 9 letters → no.

C: same → no.

D: 10 letters → yes.

E: 11 letters → no.

F: 11 → no.

G: 10 → yes.

H: same.

I: same.

J: 11→ no.

K: 11→ no.

L: 11→ no.

So, both D and G are 10 letters.

But D is a mutation and a deletion. G is a mutation but no deletion.

So, the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option G is 10 letters but is the original with a mutation. So, that's only a mutation, not a mutation and a deletion.

So, the only correct option is D.

Wait, but another way: the original is 11 letters. So, any option that can be formed by a mutation and a deletion would have to be 10 letters, which is the case for D and G.

So, the correct answer is D: 5’ – GGATCCTCGT –3’ → which is a mutation in the original and a deletion in the original.

Wait, but option G is 5’ – GGATCCTCATG –3’ → which is a mutation of the last G to T, but no deletion. So, that's not correct because the question requires both a mutation and a deletion.

So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but hold on. Let's think about the original and the options.

Original: 11 letters.

Option D: 10 letters, same as the original except last letter changed to T.

So, D is a mutation (changing G to T) and a deletion (removing the last G).

Wait, no, because option D is 10 letters. So, the original is 11 letters. So, to get option D, you have to delete one letter from the original (say, the last G). So, the result is 10 letters, which is option D.

So, in this scenario, the result of a mutation and a deletion would be option D.

Similarly, another option is G: which is a mutation of the last G to T, but no deletion.

So, the only option that is correct is D.

Wait, but let me think once again. Because option D is 10 letters, formed by a mutation (changing G to T) and a deletion (removing G). So, the original is 11 letters, after mutation and deletion, becomes 10 letters.

So, yes.

Alternatively, option G is 10 letters, but it's a mutation of the last G to T, no deletion. So, that's not correct.

So, the correct answer is D.
</think>

To determine which DNA sequence is a result of both a point mutation and a deletion, we analyze the options provided. The original DNA sequence is **5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’**, which is 11 nucleotides long. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Point Mutation**: This involves changing one nucleotide from A, T, or C to another nucleotide (e.g., G or C).
2. **Deletion**: This involves removing one nucleotide from the sequence.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (5’ – GGATCCTCA – 3’)**: This sequence is **9 nucleotides long**. It results from a deletion of **2 nucleotides**. No mutation is present, so it is incorrect.
  
- **Option B (5’ – GGATCCTCC – 3’)**: This sequence is **9 nucleotides long**. It results from a deletion of **2 nucleotides**. No mutation is present, so it is incorrect.

- **Option C (5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’)**: This sequence is **11 nucleotides long**. It is the same as the original sequence, so it has no mutation or deletion. Incorrect.

- **Option D (5’ – GGATCCTCGT – 3’)**:
  - The original sequence is **11 nucleotides (GGATCCTCATG)**.
  - This option is **10 nucleotides (GGATCCTCGT)**, which means one nucleotide has been deleted (likely the last G in the original sequence).
  - It is a **mutation** (changing G to T) and a **deletion** (removing the last G), making it a valid result of both operations.

- **Option E (5’ – GGTCCTCATC – 3’)**:
  - The original sequence is **11 nucleotides (GGATCCTCATG)**.
  - This option is **10 nucleotides (GGTCCTCATC)**, which means one nucleotide has been deleted (likely the last G in the original sequence).
  - It is a **mutation** (changing G to T) and a **deletion**, making it a valid result of both operations. However, this option is **less likely** than Option D because it involves a mutation in the middle of the sequence.

- **Option F (5’ – GGATCCGCATG – 3’)**:
  - This sequence is **11 nucleotides (GGATCCGCATG)**, which is the same as the original sequence. It has no mutation or deletion. Incorrect.

- **Option G (5’ – GGATCCTCATG – 3’)**:
  - This sequence is **10 nucleotides (GGATCCTCATG)**, which means one nucleotide has been deleted (likely the last G in the original sequence).
  - It is a **mutation** (changing G to T) but no deletion. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Option **D (5’ – GGATCCTCGT – 3’)** is the correct answer because it is formed by a **mutation** (changing G to T) and a **deletion** (removing the last G from the original sequence). It is the only option that satisfies both conditions.

ANSWER: D
