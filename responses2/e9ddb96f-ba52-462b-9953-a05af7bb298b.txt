Question:

During 1979, Mr. Anderson expected to earn $20,000. From thisincome he had planned to save $2,000. However, during 1979, Mr. Anderson got a raise which boosted his income to $23,000.If Mr. Anderson ended up saving a total of $3,000 outof his $23,000 income, what was his marginal propensity toconsume (MPC) ? (It may be assumed that if he had not receivedhis raise, Mr. Anderson would have actually saved the$2,000 that he had planned to save.)

Options:

A: 3/5
B: 2/3
C: 3/4
D: 4/5
E: 1/4
F: 7/8
G: 1/2
H: 2/5
I: 1/3
J: 5/6

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about Mr. Anderson's marginal propensity to consume (MPC). MPC is the proportion of additional income that people spend on consumption. So, basically, it's the ratio of consumption to income. I remember that MPC is calculated by (Change in Consumption)/(Change in Income).

Let me jot down the given information:

- In 1979, Mr. Anderson expected to earn $20,000 and planned to save $2,000. So, his planned saving was $2k.
- However, in 1979, he got a raise, making his income $23,000.
- After the raise, he actually saved $3,000. That's more than his planned $2,000.
- The question is, what was his marginal propensity to consume?

Wait, but I need to remember that if he didn't get the raise, he would have saved the $2,000 he planned to save. So, the change in planned saving would be from the original $2k to $2k again? Or did he save more because of the raise?

Wait, no. Because the problem says, "If he had not received his raise, Mr. Anderson would have actually saved the $2,000 that he had planned to save." So during 1979, he saved $2k, but in 1980, after the raise, he saved $3k.

So, his actual saving increased from $2k to $3k due to the raise. But we need to find the MPC. MPC is about how much he spends on consumption given an additional income. So, the MPC is the ratio of the change in consumption to the change in income.

Let's think about the changes. His income increased by $3,000 (from 20k to 23k). His planned saving didn't change because he saved the same amount as before. But because of the raise, he actually saved more. So, the change in saving is $1,000 more than planned (because 3k - 2k = 1k). 

Wait, but saving is income minus consumption. So, if his planned saving was 2k, and he actually saved 3k, that means his consumption decreased by 1k.

Wait, let's model it.

Let me think about it as:

- 1979:
   - Income: $20,000
   - Saving: $2,000
   - Therefore, Consumption = Income - Saving = 20k - 2k = 18k.

- 1980:
   - Income: $23,000
   - Saving: $3,000
   - Therefore, Consumption = 23k - 3k = 20k.

So, his consumption went from 18k to 20k, which is an increase of $2k.

Change in Income (ΔI) is 3k (because 23k - 20k = 3k). Change in Consumption (ΔC) is 2k.

MPC = ΔC / ΔI = 2k / 3k = 2/3.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option B is 2/3.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck. Because in the original plan, he was saving 2k, but he actually saved 3k because of the raise. So his actual saving is higher than planned, which suggests that his actual consumption has reduced more than planned.

Wait, but the MPC is based on the change in consumption given the change in income. So, during 1979, he saved 2k, but in 1980, he saved 3k. So, the change in saving is 1k (because 3k - 2k = 1k). But the MPC is about the change in consumption relative to income. So, during 1979, he planned to save 2k, but didn't. In 1980, he saved 3k, but his income increased, so what's the change in saving?

Wait, maybe I should model savings and consumption more clearly.

Let me think of this in terms of planned and actual saving. When he didn't get the raise, he would have saved $2k. But with the raise, he actually saved $3k. So, his actual saving is higher than planned.

So, his actual saving is 3k. His planned saving was 2k. So, the change in actual saving is 1k more than planned.

But the MPC is about how much he saves or spends as a result of an additional income, so the MPC is the ratio of the change in consumption (because that's how MPC is calculated) to the change in income.

Wait, another approach: The MPC is the proportion of additional dollars the person spends. So, if his income increases by $3k, and his consumption increases by $2k, then MPC is 2k / 3k = 2/3.

So, the answer should be B.

The question asks for the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is the proportion of additional income spent on consumption. Here's how to calculate it:

1. **1979 Details**:
   - Income: $20,000
   - Planned saving: $2,000
   - Therefore, Consumption = Income - Saving = $20,000 - $2,000 = $18,000.

2. **1980 Details**:
   - Income: $23,000
   - Actual saving: $3,000
   - Therefore, Consumption = Income - Saving = $23,000 - $3,000 = $20,000.

3. **Change in Income and Consumption**:
   - Change in Income (ΔI) = $23,000 - $20,000 = $3,000.
   - Change in Consumption (ΔC) = $20,000 - $18,000 = $2,000.

4. **MPC Calculation**:
   - MPC = ΔC / ΔI = $2,000 / $3,000 = 2/3.

Thus, the marginal propensity to consume is **2/3**.
