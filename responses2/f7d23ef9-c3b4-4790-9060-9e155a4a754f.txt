Alright, let's tackle this thermodynamics problem. Hmm, so the question is about oxygen undergoing a throttling process, which I remember is an isenthalpic process. Throttling usually occurs through a valve or valve-like device, and in such cases, the enthalpy remains constant because there's no heat exchange (assuming it's a steady-flow process as given) and no work done (since it's a flow process).

So the process is adiabatic, which means Q=0, and for throttling, it's an isenthalpic process, so H is constant. So the initial enthalpy (H1) will be equal to the final enthalpy (H2).

The problem gives the initial pressure (P1) as 13.8 MPa and the initial temperature (T1) as 15.5°C. The final pressure (P2) is 1.38 MPa. We need to find the final temperature (T2).

I think I should use the ideal gas law here. But wait, oxygen is a real gas, so maybe I should consider its specific heat or maybe use the relation for enthalpy in terms of temperature and pressure. Alternatively, since oxygen might have a specific gas constant, I can use that.

The specific gas constant R for oxygen. Oxygen has a molar mass of about 32 g/mol. So, R = 8.314 kJ/(kmol·K) → wait, no, wait. Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Oxygen's molar mass is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol. So the specific gas constant R = R_total / M = 8.314 / 0.032 ≈ 259.8 J/(kg·K).

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the specific gas constant R is 29.1 kJ/(kmol·K), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of kJ.

Let me double-check. For ideal gases, R is in J/(mol·K). Oxygen's molar mass is 32 g/mol, so 32e-3 kg/mol. So R = 8.314 J/mol·K / (0.032 kg/mol) → 8.314 / 0.032 ≈ 259.8 J/(kg·K). So R ≈ 259.8 J/(kg·K), approximately 259.8 J/(kg·K).

Now, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, which can be rearranged to T = PV/(nR). But since n is the number of moles, perhaps it's better to express T in terms of P and V. But I'm trying to relate P and T, which is needed.

Wait, in an isenthalpic process for an ideal gas, the change in enthalpy is h2 - h1 = c_p (T2 - T1) if it's an ideal gas. But Oxygens is a real gas, so maybe I should use the actual relation for enthalpy. Alternatively, I might need to use the relation involving the enthalpy function for real gases.

But wait, perhaps I can use the ideal gas assumption here. Let me proceed with that, as it's the simplest approach I can think of without getting too complicated.

So, the enthalpy change for an ideal gas is given by h = c_p T. So H2 = H1 implies c_p (T2 - T1) = 0. But wait, if H is constant, then T2 = T1 only if c_p is constant. But wait, for real gases, c_p isn't constant. That's a complication.

Hmm, so assuming ideal gas might not be accurate, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the ideal gas assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed for the ideal gas, or maybe the change in enthalpy can be considered with the ideal gas relation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the process. Since the process is throttling (isenthalpic), and we're dealing with an ideal gas, perhaps the enthalpy change can be written as h2 - h1 = c_p (T2 - T1). But for Oxygens, the c_p isn't constant because it's a real gas. So perhaps using c_p (average) might not be accurate.

Wait, but the initial and final pressures are given, and since it's throttling, the process is isenthalpic, so H1=H2. So I can write H1 = H2. And since H = c_p T for ideal gases, then H1 = c_p1 T1 and H2 = c_p2 T2. So c_p1 T1 = c_p2 T2. But that would mean T2 = (c_p2/c_p1) T1. But without knowing the specific heat capacities at different temperatures, I can't compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps the process can be approximated using the ideal gas equation. If I assume oxygen behaves as an ideal gas, then I can use the ideal gas law to find T2.

So, in the ideal case, for an isenthalpic process, H1 = H2. For ideal gases, H = c_p T. So:

H1 = c_p(T1) * M (mass) (since H = m c_p T) → H1 = m c_p1 T1.

Similarly, H2 = m c_p2 T2.

Since H1 = H2, we have m c_p1 T1 = m c_p2 T2 → T2 = T1 (c_p1 / c_p2).

But since oxygen is a real gas, I can't use the ideal gas specific heat capacities. So this approach might not be valid.

Hmm, perhaps instead, I should write the relation between P and T for an isenthalpic process for a real gas. But I don't remember the exact equation for that.

Wait, the enthalpy of a real gas is H = h = h(T, P). For a throttling process, H doesn't change. So for ideal gas, h = c_p T. But for real gas, perhaps we can use the relation h(T, P) = h(T, T) when H is constant. But I don't remember the exact equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the process would result in a decrease in temperature. Since the system is being brought down to a lower pressure, and assuming it's an ideal gas, lower pressure would imply lower temperature if no phase change occurs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the process is isenthalpic, the temperature would decrease because the pressure is going down. So among the options, the temperatures are all positive or some are negative. But wait, the initial temperature is 15.5°C. So if it's decreasing, the final temperature would be lower than the initial, but the options don't include temperatures lower than 15.5. Wait no, the options are all negative, except one (option E is -13.71).

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the process is isenthalpic, and it's a real gas, but if pressure is lower, perhaps the temperature decreases. But the initial temperature is positive (15.5°C), and the final is negative. That's a big drop. So perhaps the process isn't isenthalpic? But the problem says it's a throttling process, which is isenthalpic.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial pressure is 13.8 MPa, and final is 1.38 MPa. So the pressure is dropping by a factor of 10. If the process is isenthalpic, then T must drop as well.

But in the options, the only negative temperatures are options A to G. Wait, option E is -13.71°C, which is lower than the initial 15.5. So that's a big drop. But why would the temperature drop so much? Unless the process is exothermic, but that's not the case in a throttling process. Throttling is an isenthalpic process, so enthalpy remains the same.

Wait, but in the case of a real gas, perhaps the temperature change is more significant. Alternatively, maybe the process isn't isenthalpic, but the question states it is. Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the ideal gas law, assuming that the enthalpy change is c_p (T2-T1) =0, which would imply T2 is same as T1, but that's not possible because the pressure is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the ideal gas, but it's expecting me to use the ideal gas relation, but maybe I should proceed with that approach.

Wait, assuming ideal gas: P1 V1 / T1 = P2 V2 / T2.

But since it's a throttling process, the volume doesn't change. So V1=V2. So P1/T1 = P2/T2.

Wait, that's the ideal gas law in isothermal conditions. So, T2 = T1 * (P1 / P2).

Wait, that's the formula when the volume is constant. So for isothermal process (constant T), but here it's isenthalpic. So perhaps this approach isn't applicable.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the possible answer. The options are all negative temperatures except option A (-20), etc. The initial temperature is 15.5°C, but the final is lower. So if the process is isenthalpic, and the pressure drops, the final temperature would be lower than 15.5.

But looking at the options, the only negative temperatures are options A, B, C, D, E, F, G. So for the final temperature, it's among these.

Wait, the initial pressure is 13.8 MPa, final is 1.38 MPa. So pressure is 10 times. So, assuming ideal gas, when pressure drops, temperature would drop. So T2 = T1 * (P1/P2) = 15.5 * (13.8 / 1.38) = 15.5 * 10 = 155°C? But that's way higher than any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law for the final state. Let me try that.

In the ideal case, for the same mass, the ideal gas law is P V = m R T. So, for the initial state:

P1 V = m R T1.

For the final state:

P2 V = m R T2.

Divide the two equations: (P1 V) / (P2 V) = (m R T1) / (m R T2) ) → P1 / P2 = T1 / T2.

So, T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1).

Wait, that's for isothermal process (constant T). But that's not the case here. Because it's an isenthalpic process, so the temperature would change.

Wait, perhaps that approach isn't applicable here. Alternatively, I could try to calculate the specific heat at constant pressure (c_p) for oxygen at the given temperatures, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that for a throttling process (isenthalpic), the relation between T and P can be found using the enthalpy equation.

But honestly, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the ideal gas assumption, even though it's wrong for real gases. Let's see.

Using the ideal gas law, P1 V = m R T1. P2 V = m R T2.

Dividing equations: P1 / P2 = T1 / T2 → T2 = T1 (P2/P1) = 15.5°C * (1.38 /13.8) = 15.5 * 0.1 = 1.55°C. But that's positive, which isn't matching any of the options except for the negative ones.

Hmm, that's a problem. Since the final pressure is lower, the temperature would be lower. But the approach gives a positive temp. So perhaps I should use the real gas equation.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the change in enthalpy can be approximated using the ideal gas equation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the process is isenthalpic, so H = m c_p (T2 - T1) = 0 → T2 = T1. But that's not the case because pressure changes. So why would the enthalpy change? Because for a real gas, the enthalpy change isn't just c_p (T2-T1).

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the options are. The initial and final temperatures are all negative except option A. Wait, the initial is 15.5°C, which is 288.65 K. The final would be lower, but all options are negative. Wait, that can't be. So perhaps the problem is stated differently.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the problem statement: the initial pressure is 13.8 MPa, which is about 13.8 * 1e6 Pa. The final is 1.38 MPa. So the pressure is about 10 times lower.

Wait, but if oxygen is a real gas, does it have a lower temperature when pressure is lower? In an isenthalpic process, yes, because the enthalpy is fixed. So the temperature would decrease.

But the options are all negative. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Oh, wait, maybe the process is not isenthalpic. Wait, the question says it's a throttling process, which is isenthalpic. So the enthalpy does not change.

But all the options are negative. So that's confusing. If the final temperature is lower than 15.5°C, but all the options are negative, which is lower than 0, that can't be. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the process is not isenthalpic. But the question says it's a throttling process, which implies isenthalpic.

So I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps using the ideal gas law for the final state.

Wait, P1 V = m R T1 → V = (m R T1) / P1.

In the final state, P2 V = m R T2 → T2 = (P2 V) / (m R) → substitute V from above: T2 = (P2 (m R T1) / P1 ) / (m R) ) → cancel m R: T2 = (P2 T1) / P1.

So T2 = (1.38 MPa / 13.8 MPa) * 15.5°C.

Wait, 1.38 / 13.8 is 0.1. So T2 = 15.5 * 0.1 = 1.55°C. But that's positive. But none of the options are positive except option A, B, etc., but the options don't have positive temperatures except some.

Wait, but the options include option E as -13.71, which is lower than 15.5°C. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the pressure ratio. Let me recheck.

Wait, 13.8 MPa is P1, 1.38 MPa is P2. So 13.8 / 1.38 = 10. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.1. So T2 would be 1.55°C. But that's positive, which doesn't match any of the given options except for some negative. So perhaps the problem is designed for the ideal gas assumption, but that leads to a positive temperature, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute T2.

Wait, T2 = (P2 / P1) * T1.

Wait, P2=1.38, P1=13.8 → 1.38/13.8 = 0.1.

So T2 = 15.5 * 0.1 = 1.55°C. So positive. But all the options are negative except option A, which is -20, etc.

Wait, but the problem is that in an isenthalpic process, the temperature would decrease. So this suggests that the process is not isenthalpic, but the question says it is. So perhaps the problem expects a wrong answer, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the process is not isenthalpic, but the question says it is. I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the process is isenthalpic but Oxygens behaves in a certain way for real gas. Maybe I should use the ideal gas law with the specific heat at constant pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the specific heat capacities are the same as for an ideal gas. But that's not accurate for real gases.

Wait, but in the real gas, the specific heat at constant pressure (c_p) is higher than that of the ideal gas. So if the process is isenthalpic, the temperature would decrease.

Wait, but the final temperature calculation using ideal gas would be positive, which is not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the ideal gas law for an isentropic process, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the real gas aspect and assumes ideal gas. But that leads to a positive temperature, conflicting with the options.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific enthalpy of oxygen. Oxygen's specific heat at constant pressure is higher than that of an ideal gas, so for a given H (enthalpy), T would be lower than what it would be for an ideal gas.

Wait, but the isenthalpic process would have T2 = (P2 T1) / P1 → positive, which would conflict with the options.

Wait, but all the options are negative, which is lower than 15.5. Wait, that can't be right. Because if the pressure drops, for an isenthalpic process, the temp should drop as well.

So perhaps the problem is designed to test my understanding of the process.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the process is isenthalpic, so H is the same. For real gases, H is a function of temperature and pressure. So if H is same, and for real gas, the temperature must be lower than if it were ideal.

But in the ideal case, the temperature would be higher. So perhaps the problem's intended approach is to use the ideal gas law under the assumption that the pressure change leads to a decrease in temperature. But the calculation gives a positive temperature, which doesn't match any of the options except option A (-20), but that's a big drop.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the final temperature using the real gas equation, but that would require knowing the specific heat at constant pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ideal gas equation for the final state, but considering that the pressure is lower, but the temperature is lower.

Wait, but in the ideal case, the final temperature would be 155°C, which is way higher than any of the options. So that can't be it.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to see what the correct approach is. Maybe the problem is intended to use the ideal gas law, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute T2 correctly.

Wait, using the ideal gas law for the final state:

P2 = 1.38 MPa.

V is constant, so P1 V = m R T1, P2 V = m R T2 → T2 = (P2 / P1) * T1 → (1.38 / 13.8) * 15.5°C.

So 1.38 / 13.8 = 0.1. So T2 = 15.5 * 0.1 = 1.55°C.

But that's positive, which isn't any of the options except for option A, which is -20. So I'm clearly missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the process is not isenthalpic, but the question says it is. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the process as isenthalpic, but oxygen's specific heat is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the ideal gas law for the final state, but without considering the pressure. Hmm, not making sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific volume. Since the final pressure is 1.38 MPa, and the initial is 13.8 MPa, the volume must have increased. Because P1 V1 = P2 V2 → V2 = (P1 / P2) V1 → V2 = (13.8 / 1.38) V1 → V2 = 10 V1.

So the volume is 10 times larger. So the final volume is 10 times the initial. So, in the ideal gas law, for the final state, P V = m R T. So, P2 V2 = m R T2.

P1 V1 = m R T1 → V1 = (m R T1) / P1.

So, substituting into P2 V2:

P2 * (m R T1 / P1) ) = m R T2.

Cancel m R:

(P2 T1) / P1 = T2.

So, T2 = (P2 T1) / P1.

So, plugging in values: (1.38 * 15.5) / 13.8 = (21.47) / 13.8 ≈ 1.55°C.

Again, positive, which isn't an option except option A, which is -20. So why would the final temperature be negative? Because the pressure drops, so the temperature would drop, but the initial is positive. So the final should be lower than 15.5, which is positive, but the options don't have any negative except for some.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure ratio. Let me compute it again.

1.38 /13.8 = 0.1.

So, T2 = 15.5 * 0.1 = 1.55°C. Positive, which isn't in the options except for option A, which is -20.

So perhaps the problem is intended to have the final temperature as negative, but that's not possible in an isenthalpic process. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the ideal gas, but it's about the enthalpy change. Let me try that.

If the process is isenthalpic, then H1=H2.

For a real gas, H depends on temperature and pressure. So, perhaps H2 can be calculated based on H1 and the pressure change.

But without knowing the specific heat, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the ideal gas law and calculate T2 as I did, but then use the ideal gas law again, but with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ideal gas law for the final state, but considering that the initial pressure is 13.8 MPa and the final is 1.38 MPa. Let me think in terms of the ideal gas law, but perhaps I should not assume ideal behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the ideal gas law for the final state, but without considering the pressure change, so T2 = T1 * (P2/P1). Wait, P2 is lower, so T2 would be lower. So 15.5 * (1.38/13.8) = 15.5 * 0.1=1.55°C. Positive, which again doesn't match the options except for some negative.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure ratio. Wait, wait, 13.8 is 13.8e6 Pa, 1.38 is 1.38e6 Pa. So, the ratio is 10.

So T2 = T1 * (1.38 / 13.8) = 15.5 * 0.1=1.55°C. Positive.

But the options don't include a positive temperature except for some negative ones. So perhaps the problem expects me to choose the option that is the most negative, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the process is isenthalpic for an ideal gas, but oxygen's specific heat is higher, so the temperature would be lower. Wait, but the ideal gas approach gives a positive temperature, which is not any of the options except for option A, which is negative.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of this another way. The problem says that the throttling process is isenthalpic. So the process is isenthalpic, but the initial and final temperatures are positive. So the final temperature should be lower than the initial, but all the options are negative.

Wait, but the initial is positive, so the final can't be negative. So perhaps the problem is designed to have the final temperature as negative, which is not possible in this scenario. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem is intended to use the ideal gas law for the final state, but using the specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) for oxygen at the given temperatures.

So, for oxygen, Cp at 15.5°C is needed. But without knowing, perhaps I can approximate it. The specific heat of oxygen at constant pressure (for ideal gas) is about 7.2 kJ/kg·K, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the average specific heat. But without knowing, perhaps I can proceed with Cp ≈ 7.2 kJ/kg·K.

So, the enthalpy change is H2 - H1 = Cp (T2 - T1).

But H is same for both states, so H2 = H1.

So, H2 - H1 = 0 = Cp (T2 - T1) → T2 = T1. But that's not possible because pressure changes.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. I think I should make an educated guess based on the calculations.

Wait, using the ideal gas law approach, T2 is 1.55°C, which is positive. But the options don't have any positive temperatures except for some negative ones. So perhaps the correct answer is option E, which is -13.71°C.

But why would the temperature drop? Because the pressure drops. But the ideal gas approach gives a positive temperature. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute T2.

Using P1 V = m R T1 → V = (m R T1) / P1.

In the final state: P2 V = m R T2.

Substituting V: (P2 * (m R T1) / P1 ) ) = m R T2.

Cancel m R: T2 = (P2 T1) / P1.

So, T2 = (1.38 * 15.5) / 13.8 → (21.47) / 13.8 → approximately 1.55°C.

So T2 is positive, which is not in the given options. But the options don't have any positive, except perhaps some negative. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option E.

Wait, but according to the calculations, T2 is 1.55°C, which is positive. So none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is intended to have the final temperature as negative, but that's impossible in this scenario.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. I think I need to write that the correct answer is option E, but I'm not sure.
</think>

The problem involves determining the final temperature of a throttling process for oxygen. Oxygen undergoes an isenthalpic process, meaning its enthalpy remains constant. For an ideal gas, this process can be analyzed using the ideal gas law, but oxygen is a real gas, complicating the analysis.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Throttling Process**:  
   - The process is isenthalpic, so \( H_1 = H_2 \).  
   - For an ideal gas, \( H = m c_p T \), where \( c_p \) is the specific heat at constant pressure.  
   - For a real gas, \( c_p \) is higher than for an ideal gas, so the temperature would decrease for a given enthalpy.

2. **Ideal Gas Law**:  
   - Using the ideal gas law, \( P V = m R T \), for the initial and final states.  
   - The volume changes since the pressure decreases: \( V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1}{P_2} \).  
   - Substituting \( V_1 = \frac{m R T_1}{P_1} \), we find the final temperature:  
     \[
     T_2 = \frac{P_2 T_1}{P_1}
     \]  
   - Plugging in the values:  
     \[
     T_2 = \frac{1.38 \cdot 15.5}{13.8} = \frac{21.47}{13.8} \approx 1.55^\circ C
     \]  
   - This result is positive, which conflicts with the given options (all are negative or zero).

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - The calculations suggest that the final temperature should be positive, but none of the provided options match this result.  
   - The only plausible option, despite its inconsistency, is **E (-13.71°C)**, which could be a result of an error in the problem setup or interpretation.

ANSWER: E
