Question:

What is meant by cross elasticity of demand?

Options:

A: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percent-age change in the price of a good and the per-centage change in the quantity demanded of another good
B: Cross elasticity is the measure of how the quantity supplied of one good changes in response to a change in price of the same good
C: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percent-age change in the quantity demanded of a good and the per-centage change in the price of another good.
D: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity supplied of a good and the percentage change in the price of another good
E: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in price of a good and the percentage change in the quantity demanded of the same good
F: Cross elasticity is the change in demand for a good due to a change in the price of a complementary good
G: Cross elasticity is the change in quantity demanded of a good due to a change in income of the consumer
H: Cross elasticity is the measure of the change in the quantity demanded of a good in response to a change in the consumer's taste
I: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the quantity demanded of a good and the price of another good
J: Cross elasticity is the change in quantity demanded of a good due to the change in price of the same good

Okay, so I need to figure out what cross elasticity of demand means. I remember from my economics class that cross elasticity has something to do with how two goods are related in terms of price changes affecting each other.

Let me start by thinking about what cross elasticity actually is. I recall that it measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. Oh right, that's when the two goods are substitutes or complements. Wait, no, if they're substitutes, an increase in the price of one good would lead to an increase in demand for the other. But if they're complements, increasing the price of one would decrease demand for the other.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says it's the ratio of price change in a good to quantity change in another. Wait, no, that's not right because cross elasticity is about quantity change in one good to price change in another. So A might be wrong.

Option B talks about quantity supplied, not quantity demanded. So B is about supply, not demand. So probably wrong.

Option C states the ratio between percentage change in quantity demanded of a good and percentage change in price of another. That sounds correct because cross elasticity is about how much the quantity demanded of good A responds to a change in the price of good B.

Option D says it's the ratio of percentage change in quantity supplied to price change in another. No, because cross elasticity is about demand, not supply. So D is for supply, not demand.

Option E mentions price of the same good, which is price elasticity. So E is about price elasticity of demand, so not cross elasticity.

Option F says it's the change in demand due to price of complementary. Wait, complementary goods are ones where a price increase in one leads to a decrease in demand for the other. So this sounds like cross elasticity, but F's wording is a bit confusing. It says "due to change in price of complementary good." That's correct in the context of cross elasticity, but the phrasing might not be standard. So I'm not sure if F is the right choice.

Option G talks about change in consumer taste. That's more about price elasticity of demand, not cross elasticity. Cross elasticity is about two goods, not just a change in taste of a single good.

Option H mentions quantity demanded and price of another good. That's similar to option C. So H might be correct, but I thought C was the right one.

Option I is about quantity demanded over price, which doesn't fit because cross elasticity is a ratio of percentage changes, not quantities over prices.

Option J says change in quantity demanded due to change in price of same good. That's price elasticity, not cross elasticity.

So after going through each option, the correct one should be option C, which is the ratio between the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good and the percentage change in the price of another good.

Wait, to make sure, cross elasticity (E_xy) is calculated as (ΔQx / Qx) divided by (ΔPy / Py), which is the same as (ΔQx / ΔPy) * (Py / Qx). So it's the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded of good X to the percentage change in price of good Y.

So the correct answer is option C.

The correct answer is **C: Cross elasticity is the ratio between the percent-age change in the quantity demanded of a good and the per-centage change in the price of another good.**

**Explanation:**
Cross elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. It helps determine if the goods are substitutes (cross elasticity positive) or complements (cross elasticity negative). The formula involves the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good divided by the percentage change in price of another good, which directly corresponds to option C. Other options either refer to different concepts (e.g., supply, price elasticity, change in demand) or incorrectly phrase the relationship.
