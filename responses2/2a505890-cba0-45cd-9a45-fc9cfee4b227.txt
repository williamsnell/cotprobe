Okay, so I've got this problem about maximizing profits for North Sea Wells. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the price of a barrel of crude oil is $2 per barrel for the whole month. North Sea Wells is trying to figure out how many barrels they should extract each day to make the most money. The cost function given is C(x) = (x²)/10,000 + 500, where x is the number of barrels extracted per day and C(x) is in dollars.

Hmm, I think I remember that profit is generally calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So I need to find the revenue and subtract the cost, then find the x that maximizes this profit function.

First, let's figure out the total revenue. Since each barrel is $2, the revenue per day would be 2 times the number of barrels extracted. So the revenue function R(x) is R(x) = 2x.

Next, the cost function is given as C(x) = (x²)/10,000 + 500. So the profit P(x) would be Revenue minus Cost: P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 2x - [ (x²)/10,000 + 500 ].

Let me write that out: P(x) = 2x - (x²)/10,000 - 500.

Now, to find the maximum profit, I think I need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and set it equal to zero. Because at the maximum point, the slope of the profit curve is zero.

So, let's compute the derivative P'(x). The derivative of 2x is 2. The derivative of -(x²)/10,000 is -(2x)/10,000, which simplifies to -x/5,000. The derivative of -500 is zero.

Putting it all together: P'(x) = 2 - (x)/5,000.

Set this equal to zero for maximization:

2 - (x)/5,000 = 0

Solving for x:

2 = x/5,000
Multiply both sides by 5,000: x = 2 * 5,000 = 10,000.

Wait, but wait a second. That gives me x = 10,000 barrels per day. Looking at the options, that's option E. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might make a mistake with units or the derivative.

Wait another thing: The unit of x is barrels per day. The cost function is in dollars, which is correct because revenue is in dollars.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the cost function correctly given? Yes, (x²)/10k + 500. So the derivative is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider whether this is a quadratic function. The profit function is a quadratic function of x. Since the coefficient of x² is negative (because it's -x²/10k), the parabola opens downward, so the vertex is the maximum point.

The vertex of a quadratic function ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Let's see, in the profit function P(x) = -x²/10k + 2x - 500, so a is -1/10k (which is -1/10,000), and b is 2.

So the vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = -2/(2*(-1/10,000)) = -2/( -2/10,000) = (2) / (2/10,000) )= 10,000.

So again, x=10,000. So option E.

Wait, but wait. The answer options have 17,500, 25,000, 20,000, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the cost function?

Wait, the cost function is (x²)/10,000 + 500. So when x is 10,000, C(x)= (1e8)/1e4 +500= 10,000 + 500 = 10,500.

Revenue R(x) = 2 * 10,000 = 20,000.

Profit P(x) = 20,000 -10,500=9,500.

But let me check for another point. Suppose x is 15,000. Then C(x)= (15,000)^2 /10,000 = 225,000 /10,000 =22.5. So C(x)=22.5 +500=522.5.

Revenue R= 30,000. Profit is 30,000 -522.5=29,477.5. That's much higher than 9,500.

Wait, but according to my previous calculation, the maximum is at x=10,000, but the options don't have 10,000. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says North Sea Wells is trying to decide how many barrels a day. But wait, is the cost function per day or per barrel? Because the cost function is given as C(x) = x² /10,000 + 500, where x is barrels per day. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me re-calculate.

P(x) = 2x - (x²)/10,000 -500.

dP/dx = 2 - (2x)/10,000 = 2 - x/5,000.

Setting to zero: 2 - x/5000 =0 → x=10,000.

So I think that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is 10,000, but that's not an option in the choices. Wait, wait, the options are:

A:12,500

B:7,500

C:30,000

D:15,000

E:10,000

F:20,000

G:2,500

H:5,000

I:25,000

J:17,500.

So option E is 10,000, which is what I got. But wait, let me double-check: perhaps the revenue function is not 2x, but something else.

Wait, the price is $2 per barrel, so yes, revenue should be 2x.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost function is per day, but maybe I should think about whether the cost per day is per barrel or per unit.

Wait, in the cost function, C(x) is given as (x²)/10,000 +500, where x is barrels per day. So, if x is in barrels per day, and each barrel costs $2, then the cost per day for x barrels would be x * 2 dollars. So the cost function as given seems correct.

So with that, the maximum profit occurs at x=10,000. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computation. Let me compute P(x) at x=10,000.

Profit = 2*10,000 - (10,000²)/10,000 -500.

Let me compute each term:

2x: 20,000

(x²)/10,000: (100,000,000)/10,000 = 10,000

So P =20,000 -10,000 -500 =9,500.

Now, let's check another option, say, option E is 10,000. Wait, but maybe I should check the options again. Oh wait, looking back, the options are A to J, with E being 10,000. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative. Let me think again.

The derivative of (x²)/10,000 is (2x)/10,000, which is x/5,000. So, P'(x)= 2 - (x)/5,000.

Setting to zero: 2 - x/5,000 =0 → x=10,000.

So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let's think about the function again. Since this is a quadratic with a negative x² coefficient, the function opens downward, so the vertex is a maximum. So x=10,000 is the maximum.

But in the options, E is 10,000. But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the cost function is per barrel? Let me check.

Wait, the problem states that C(x) is in dollars and is (x²)/10,000 +500, where x is the number of barrels extracted per day. So x is in barrels/day, C(x) is in dollars.

So, for x barrels per day, the cost is x²/10000 +500.

So, yes, the cost per day is 2x dollars, as each barrel is $2.

Therefore, the profit is 2x - (x²/10,000 +500).

Which is correct.

Wait, but according to the options, 10,000 is an option (E). So why do the other options have higher numbers?

Wait, maybe I should consider another approach. Perhaps using the formula for maximum profit, but sometimes people use different units or different profit expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the derivative. Let me re-calculate the derivative.

P(x)=2x - (x²)/10,000 -500. 

dP/dx= 2 - (2x)/10,000 = 2 - x/5,000.

Set to zero:

2 - x/5000=0 → x=10,000.

So no mistake, seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I should check for the maximum profit where the derivative is zero, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the derivative.

Wait, 2x derivative is 2.

The derivative of (x²)/10,000 is (2x)/10,000 → x/5,000.

So, correct.

So maybe the options have a typo, but since E is 10,000, which is correct, I should pick that.

Wait, but wait. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the revenue function. Let me think: if the price is $2 per barrel, the revenue per day would be 2 multiplied by the number of barrels extracted per day. So, yes, R(x)=2x.

But perhaps I should think about the cost function in terms of per barrel instead of per day.

Wait, but the cost function is given as C(x) = (x²)/10,000 +500, where x is barrels per day. So that's correct. So the cost is per day.

Hmm, so everything seems correct. So the maximum profit is at 10,000 barrels per day, which is option E.

But wait, looking back, the options don't include 10,000 as a possible answer. Wait, no, option E is 10,000.

Wait, but looking again, option E is 10,000, which is correct. So why would the question have an option like that? Because perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the cost function is per barrel instead of per day.

Wait, the problem says C(x) is in dollars and is (x²)/10,000 +500, where x is barrels per day. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that the cost per day is C(x) = (x²)/10,000 +500, and the price is $2 per barrel. So the total revenue is 2x. Profit is 2x - (x²/10,000 +500)= 2x - x²/10,000 -500.

To find the maximum, take derivative:

d/dx (2x -x²/10,000 -500) = 2 - (2x)/10,000 = 2 -x/5,000.

Set to zero: 2 =x/5,000 → x=10,000.

So, again, the answer is 10,000 barrels per day, option E.

Wait, but in the options, E is 10,000. So why am I getting that? Because the options given are A to J, and E is 10,000.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the maximum profit again. If I plug in x=10,000 into the profit function:

Profit P=2*10,000 - (10,000^2)/10,000 -500 =20,000 -10,000 -500=9,500.

If I try x=17,500 as in option J, then R=2*17,500=35,000. C= (17,500)^2/10,000 = (306,250,000)/10,000=30,625. So C=30,625 +500=31,125.

Profit=35,000 -31,125=3,875. That's less than 9,500.

If I try x=25,000 (option I), R=50,000. C=(25,000)^2/10,000=625,000,000/10,000=62,500. Plus 500, so 63,000. Profit=50,000 -63,000= -13,000. That's a loss.

So the maximum is indeed at x=10,000, which is option E. So the answer should be E.

The problem involves maximizing profit for North Sea Wells, where the price per barrel is $2, and the cost function is given as \( C(x) = \frac{x^2}{10,000} + 500 \), with \( x \) representing barrels per day. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost, and the derivative of the profit function is set to zero to find the optimal \( x \).

1. **Revenue Function**: \( R(x) = 2x \).
2. **Cost Function**: \( C(x) = \frac{x^2}{10,000} + 500 \).
3. **Profit Function**: \( P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 2x - \left( \frac{x^2}{10,000} + 500 \right) \).
4. **Derivative of Profit Function**: \( P'(x) = 2 - \frac{2x}{10,000} = 2 - \frac{x}{5,000} \).
5. **Setting Derivative to Zero**: \( 2 - \frac{x}{5,000} = 0 \) → \( x = 10,000 \).

The maximum profit occurs at \( x = 10,000 \) barrels per day. Among the options, \( 10,000 \) corresponds to option **E**.
