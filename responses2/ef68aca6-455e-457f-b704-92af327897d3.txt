Okay, so I've got this graph theory question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 in an undirected graph. The graph's edges are given as E = {<0,1>,<0,2>,<0,3>,<0,5>,<2,3>,<2,4>,<4,5>}. I need to represent the path as a list of nodes.

Hmm, the options are labeled A through J, with each being a different path. I remember that the shortest path in an undirected graph can be found using algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search) since it finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

So first, I should probably visualize the graph. Let me sketch it out. Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3, and 5. Node 1 is connected only to 0. Node 2 is connected to 0 and 3. Node 3 is connected to 0, 2, and 4. Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, and 5. Node 5 is connected to 0 and 4.

Wait, so node 5 is connected to 0 and 4. And from node 4, it's connected to 5 as well. So, the possible paths from 0 to 5 could go through various nodes.

I think I should model this as a graph and see what's the shortest path. Since BFS explores nodes level by level, it should give the shortest path in terms of the number of edges, which for simple graphs is equivalent to the minimal number of steps, which I believe is the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.

Let me think about how BFS would proceed. Starting from node 0, we enqueue all its neighbors. So the first level is 0. Then, the next level would be 1, 2, 3, and 5 (since they are all directly connected to 0). The distance from 0 to each is 1.

But wait, the target is node 5. So looking at the options, option H is [0,5], which is one step. But is that the shortest path? Let me check.

Wait, but wait. Are there any shorter paths? Let's see.

Looking for another possible path. From 0 to 2: 0-2 is one step. Then from 2 to 4 is another step (since 2 is connected to 0 and 3, and 4 is connected to 2). Wait, 0 to 2 is one edge. Then 2 to 4 is another, and 4 to 5 is another. So that's 0-2-4-5, which is three steps. But the direct path is just 0-5, which is two steps? Wait, no—wait, 0 to 5 is a direct edge, so it's just one step. So why is option H [0,5] but that's a single step.

But wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. The path is a list of nodes, so each step is a movement along an edge. So from 0 to 5 is one step, which is the shortest possible.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I missed some edges. Let me make sure the graph is correctly represented. The edges are:

0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-5, 2-3, 2-4, 4-5.

So, 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5. 2 is connected to 0,3,4. 4 is connected to 2,5. 3 is connected to 0,2,4.

So looking for the shortest path from 0 to 5. So the direct edge 0-5 is available, which is just one step. So the path would be [0,5]. But wait, looking at the options, option H is [0,5], which would be the correct answer. But wait, that seems too easy, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is directed, but the question says it's undirected. So no, it's undirected.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should model this as a BFS and see.

In BFS, the initial queue has 0. We dequeue 0, enqueue all its neighbors. So the first level (distance 1) is 1,2,3,5.

When we process node 1, we look at its neighbors—only 0, which is already visited. So nothing new.

Processing node 2: neighbors are 0 (visited), 3,4. So enqueue 3 and 4.

Processing node 3: neighbors are 0,2 (visited),4. Enqueue 4 again.

Processing node 5: neighbors are 0 (visited),4. Enqueue 4 again.

Wait, but 4 is already in the queue. So, let's track the order.

Queue starts as [0].

Dequeue 0, enqueue 1,2,3,5.

Now, the queue is [1,2,3,5].

Dequeue 1: no new nodes.

Dequeue 2: enqueue 3,4. Queue becomes [3,4,5].

Dequeue 3: enqueue 4. Queue becomes [4,5].

Dequeue 4: enqueue 5. Queue becomes [5].

Dequeue 5: no new nodes.

So the BFS ends.

The levels are:

Level 0: 0.

Level 1: 1,2,3,5.

Level 2: 4.

Level 3: none.

So the shortest path from 0 to 5 is one step, which is correct.

But looking back at the options, option H is [0,5], which is correct. So why is the question presented as a multiple-choice question with options longer than one step? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option H is [0,5], but perhaps the question is about the shortest path in terms of the number of nodes, not edges. No, the question says the shortest path, which is the least number of edges.

Wait, perhaps the initial problem is about a directed graph? No, the question says it's an undirected graph.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, another possible path is 0-2-4-5, which is three steps. But that's longer than the direct path.

So the shortest path is 0-5, which is one step. So the correct answer should be option H, which is [0,5].

But wait, looking at the options, option H is [0,5], but the options have F: [0,3,2,5], which is also three steps and longer.

Wait, but the shortest path is the one with the least edges. So 0-5 is just one edge, which is the shortest possible.

So the correct answer should be option H: [0,5].

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is [0,3,2,5], which is longer. So why is that even an option?

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the graph representation. Let me see. Are all the edges present? Let me recheck:

Edges E are:
<0,1>, <0,2>, <0,3>, <0,5>, <2,3>, <2,4>, <4,5>.
Yes, that's correct.

So 0 is connected to 1,2,3,5. 2 is connected to 0,3,4. 4 is connected to 2,5. 3 is connected to 0,2,4.

So, looking at the options, the possible shortest paths are:

H: [0,5] - length 1.

F: [0,3,2,5] - length 3.

So, the shortest is H.

But wait, the options also include [0,2,5], which is option B. Let me think. [0,2,5] is two steps. The path 0-2-5 is two edges, right? Because 0 to 2 is one edge, 2 to 5 is another. So that's two steps.

Wait, so the path [0,2,5] is two steps, which is longer than [0,5] which is one step. So why isn't [0,2,5] an option? Option B is [0,2,5], which is two steps.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the options.

Options are:

A: [0,1,3,5] → 4 nodes, 3 steps.

B: [0,2,5] → 3 nodes, 2 steps.

C: [0,3,5] → 3 nodes, 2 steps.

D: [0,2,3,5] → 4 nodes, 3 steps.

E: [0,1,2,5] → 4 nodes, 3 steps.

F: [0,3,2,5] → 4 nodes, 3 steps.

G: [0,1,5] → 3 nodes, 2 steps.

H: [0,5] → 2 nodes, 1 step.

I: [0,1,2,3,5] → 5 nodes, 4 steps.

J: [0,2,4,5] → 4 nodes, 3 steps.

So the shortest is H, which is 1 step. So the correct answer should be H.

But wait, why is option B [0,2,5] an option? Oh, because it's a possible path. But it's longer than H.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the graph again. Are there any other paths that are shorter? No. Because from 0 to 5 is directly connected.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is the direct edge 0-5, which is one step. The path [0,5] is the shortest.
