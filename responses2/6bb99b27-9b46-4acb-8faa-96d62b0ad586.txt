Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the digit that immediately precedes the last three zeros in 30! (30 factorial). The question says that 30! ends with 7 zeros, so I know that's correct. Now, I need to find the digit right before those zeros.

Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in it, which comes from the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factors. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros.

But wait, the question isn't just about the number of zeros; it's about the digit that comes right before them. So I need a way to find the penultimate digit of 30!.

I think I can compute 30! and then look at its last few digits, but 30! is a huge number. Maybe there's a smarter way instead of calculating the entire factorial.

I recall that modulo operations can help find specific digits. Since the last three zeros are determined by factors of 10, I can look for the number modulo 100000 or something similar. Wait, but if I want the digit before the last three zeros, that's the digit in the ten-thousands place, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Wait, no, the last three zeros are at the end, so the digit before them is the one in the ten thousands place. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 30! ends with 7 zeros. So the last three zeros are the 30th, 29th, and 28th digits from the end. So the digit before those would be the 27th digit from the end. Hmm, but how do I find that?

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 30! modulo 100000, but that would give me the last five digits. Wait, but if I compute 30! mod 100000, I can get the last five digits, which would include the digits before the last three zeros. Let me see.

Wait, no. Wait, 30! ends with 7 zeros, so the last seven digits are zeros. So to find the digit before those, I need the sixth last digit. So maybe I can compute 30! mod 1000000, and that would give me the last six digits. Then, the sixth digit from the end is the one I need.

Wait, yeah, 30! mod 1,000,000 would give me the last six digits. Then, if I look at those six digits, the sixth from the end is the digit I'm looking for.

Alternatively, if I compute 30! mod 1000000, which is a large number, but perhaps manageable.

But calculating 30! manually is tedious, but maybe I can find a pattern or use properties of factorials modulo a number.

Wait, 30! includes factors up to 30. Let me think about how to compute 30! mod 1000000 efficiently.

Wait, but 1000000 is 10^6, which is 2^6 * 5^6. Since 30! includes plenty of 2s and 5s, so 30! is divisible by 10^7, meaning it's divisible by 10^6. So 30! mod 1000000 would be 0, but that doesn't help because I'm looking for the digit before the last seven zeros. Wait, no, that's not right because 30! is a multiple of 10^7, so it's divisible by 10^6 as well. So 30! mod 1000000 is 0. That can't be the case, as the digit before the last seven zeros would be some digit, but if 30! is a multiple of 1000000, the last six digits would be zeros, so the sixth from the end would be zero.

But wait, that can't be right because 30! is not a multiple of 1000000. Wait, wait, let me double-check. 30! has 7 trailing zeros, which means that 30! is divisible by 10^7, but not necessarily by 10^8. So 10^7 divides 30!, but 10^8 doesn't. So 30! mod 10000000 (which is 10^7 * 10) would be 0, because 10^7 divides 30!.

Wait, but that would mean 30! mod 10000000 is 0, so the last seven digits are zeros. So the digit before those (the last four digits before the seven zeros) would be the digit in the ten thousands place. Wait, no, wait: the last seven zeros would make the last seven digits zero. So the digit before those would be the sixth from the end. Let me count: positions are 1 (units), 2 (tens), ..., 7 (10^6 place). So the last seven digits are 0000000. So the sixth digit from the end would be the sixth last digit. Hmm, but if the last seven digits are 0000000, then the sixth digit from the end is 0 as well.

But wait, that would mean the digit before the seven zeros is 0. But looking at the options, 0 is an option (A). But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, maybe I should think of 30! divided by 10^7, and find the last digit of that quotient. Because if I have 30! = 10^7 * K, where K is an integer, then 30! ends with seven zeros, and K is the number without those zeros. So the digit before the last seven zeros would be the last digit of K. Because when you have ...0000000, dividing by 10^7 would give K = ...xyz, where x is the digit before the last seven zeros.

So, the question reduces to finding K mod 10, which is the last digit of K.

Wait, but how do I find K mod 10? Since K is 30! / 10^7.

So, K = 30! / (10^7) = 30! / (2^7 * 5^7). Since 30! has more factors of 2 and 5 than that, the division is exact, and K is an integer.

To find K mod 10, I can compute (30! / 10^7) mod 10.

Alternatively, since 10^7 = 2^7 * 5^7, and 30! has factors 2^26 and 5^6 (since there are 6 5s and 26 2s in 30! when counting exponents). But wait, 30! has 7 factors of 5, because floor(30/5) + floor(30/25) = 6 +1=7. Similarly, 2s: floor(30/2)=15, floor(30/4)=7, floor(30/8)=3, floor(30/16)=1, floor(30/32)=0. Sum is 15+7+3+1=26. So 30! has 7 5s and 26 2s, so 10^7 is a factor, and K is an integer.

So to compute K mod 10, which is the last digit of K, I can compute 30!/(2^7 *5^7) mod 10.

Wait, but 30! = 2^26 *5^7 * (other primes). So, 30! / (2^7 *5^7) = 2^(26-7) *5^(7-7) * (other primes) = 2^19 * (other primes).

So K = 2^19 * (other primes). Now, I need to find K mod 10. But 10 factors into 2 and 5, and K has 2^19. So K mod 10 would be (2^19 * (other primes)) mod 10.

Wait, but other primes include the product of primes greater than 5. So perhaps I can compute this modulo 10. Let me see.

Alternatively, since 2^19 mod 10 can be found, and the other primes mod 10 would contribute something else, but perhaps I can find a pattern.

Wait, 2^1 mod10=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=6, 2^5=2, and then it repeats every 4. So 2^19: 19 divided by 4 is 4*4=16, remainder 3. So 2^19 mod10 is 8.

So 2^19 mod10 is 8. Now, the other primes in K are multiplied together. Let's call the product of the other primes as P. So K = 2^19 * P.

But I'm trying to compute K mod10, which is (2^19 * P) mod10. Since 2^19 mod10 is 8, that part is 8. Now, what about P mod something? Hmm, perhaps not directly helpful.

Wait, maybe I can compute P mod 5, and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Because if I can find P mod 5, then I can find 8 * P mod10.

Wait, because 10=2*5, and 2 and 5 are coprime. So using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, I can find x ≡ 8 mod2 and x≡ something mod5.

Wait, but 8 mod2 is 0, so x must be even. But since 10 divides x, x must be 0 mod5 as well. So perhaps P mod5 is 0. But that might not be the case. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that P is the product of the other primes in 30! after dividing by 2^7 and 5^7. Let me see: 30! / (2^7 *5^7) = 30! / (2^7 *5^7) = (2^26 *5^7 * ...other primes)/ (2^7 *5^7) = 2^19 * (other primes).

So P is the product of the remaining primes in 30! after removing 2^7 and 5^7.

So P includes primes like 3,7,11,13,17,19,23,29, etc., up to 30.

But to find P mod something, perhaps I can compute P mod 5 and mod 2, but wait, since P is the product of other primes, and 2 is already handled in the 2^19.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute P mod5. Since 30! includes 5^7, but in P we have 5^0, so P includes all primes except 2 and 5, each raised to their respective exponents.

Wait, but 30! has 7 5s, so P has 5^0, which is 1. So P is the product of primes in 30! excluding 2 and 5, each to their respective exponents.

So P is an integer, and I need to find P mod5.

Wait, but 30! includes 5^7, but P has 5^0, which is 1. So P mod5 is the product of primes >5 in 30! each raised to their exponents.

Wait, but 30! includes primes like 3,7,11,13,17,19,23,29.

So let's compute P mod5.

But calculating P mod5 for such a large product might be tricky, but perhaps there's a pattern or a way to find it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product modulo 5 step by step, considering that 30! / (2^7 *5^7) is K, and K mod10 is the digit we're looking for.

Wait, perhaps I can compute K mod10 directly by considering the exponents and the product.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shortcut. I remember that for trailing zeros, the digit before them can sometimes be found by looking at the value modulo 10^something, but perhaps it's easier to find K mod10.

Wait, another approach: since K = 30! / 10^7, and 10^7 = 2^7 *5^7, then K = 30! / (2^7 *5^7). So K = (30! /5^7) / 2^7.

But 30! /5^7 is an integer. Let's denote that as M. So M = 30! /5^7. Then K = M / 2^7.

So, K = M / 2^7.

But I'm trying to find K mod10. So perhaps I can compute M mod (2^7 *10) = M mod (128*10) = M mod1280.

But computing M mod1280 might be manageable.

Wait, but 30! is a huge number. Let me think about how to compute M mod1280.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 30! divided by 5^7, then divide by 2^7, and take mod10.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps using Legendre's formula to find the exponents of primes in 30!.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, maybe I should look for a pattern or formula for the last non-zero digit of a factorial. I think there are algorithms for that, but since I'm not familiar, perhaps I can think differently.

Wait, another idea: the last non-zero digit before the seven zeros in 30! can be found by computing (30! / 10^7) mod10.

Which is equivalent to (30! / (2^7 *5^7)) mod10.

Which is equal to (30! /5^7) / 2^7 mod10.

But 30! /5^7 is an integer, and then divide by 2^7.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 30! /5^7 mod (2^7 *10), because then I can find K mod10.

Wait, but let me try to compute M = 30! /5^7, and then compute M /2^7 mod10.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute M mod (2^7 *10) = M mod 1280.

But calculating M mod1280 might be possible.

Wait, let's compute 30! and then divide by 5^7, then divide by 2^7, then take mod10.

But 30! is 265252859812191058636308480000000. Wait, I can't compute that directly, but perhaps I can compute it modulo 1280 * 10 = 12800.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute 30! modulo 12800, then divide by 5^7 and 2^7, then mod10.

Wait, but 30! is divisible by 10^7, so 30! mod12800 would be a multiple of 10^7, which is 10000000. So 30! mod12800 is 0, because 10^7 is a multiple of 12800? Wait, 10^7 is 10000000, and 12800 is 128*100, which is 12800. 10000000 divided by 12800 is 7812.5. So 10^7 = 12800 *7812 + 8000. So 30! is 12800 *7812 + 8000. So 30! mod12800 is 8000.

So M =30! /5^7 mod12800.

But 30! mod12800 is 8000. Now, M = (30! /5^7) mod12800.

Hmm, but 30! = 2^26 *5^7 * (other primes). So, when we divide by 5^7, it's like removing the 5^7 factor.

Wait, so 30! /5^7 = 2^26 * (other primes) * (product of primes >5). So, it's an integer.

But computing this modulo 12800 is tricky. Maybe I can compute M as (30! /5^7) mod12800.

Wait, 30! /5^7 is a huge number, but perhaps I can compute it modulo 12800.

Wait, let me compute 30! /5^7 mod12800.

But 30! is divisible by 5^7, so 30! =5^7 * K, where K is an integer.

So, K =30! /5^7.

We can compute K mod12800 as follows:

Since 30! = 10^7 * L, where L is an integer. Then, L = K/(2^7). So, K = L *2^7.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute L mod (12800 /2^7) )= 12800 /128=100.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (30! /10^7) mod10, which is the last non-zero digit before the trailing zeros. I think there's a formula for that.

Wait, I remember that the last non-zero digit of n! can be found using certain modular arithmetic techniques. Let me see if I can apply that here.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (n! / 10^k) mod10, where k is the number of trailing zeros. So, in this case, n=30, trailing zeros=7, so compute (30! /10^7) mod10.

Which is the same as (30! /10^7) mod10.

Which is the same as (30! mod (10^8)) / (10^7) ) mod10.

Wait, but 30! mod10^8 is a number, and then dividing by 10^7 gives a number mod10.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 30! mod (10^8) and then divide by 10^7, then take mod10.

Wait, 10^8 is 100000000. Let me compute 30! mod100000000.

But 30! includes 2^26 and 5^7, so 30! mod100000000 is 0. Wait, no, because 30! is divisible by 10^7, so 30! mod10^8 is 0? That can't be right, because 30! includes more factors of 2 and 5 than 10^8.

Wait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me clarify:

30! has 7 factors of 5 and 26 factors of 2. So, 30! = 5^7 * (other primes) * 2^26.

So, 30! = 5^7 * 2^26 * (other primes).

So, 30! mod10^8 = 30! mod(2^8 *5^8) = (5^7 * 2^26) * (other primes) mod(2^8 *5^8).

Wait, this is getting complicated, perhaps I should use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Wait, to compute 30! mod2^8 and mod5^8.

Wait, 30! has 5^7, so mod5^8 would be 0 mod5^7, but 30! has more factors of 5 than 5^7, so mod5^8 is 0.

Similarly, 30! has 2^26, so mod2^8 is 0.

So, 30! ≡0 mod2^8 and mod5^8.

Thus, 30! mod10^8 is 0.

Wait, but that's not correct because 30! includes more factors of 2 and 5 than 10^8.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the modulus. Let me think again: 10^8 is 2^8 *5^8. So, 30! includes 2^26 and 5^7, so 30! is 2^26 *5^7 * (other primes). So, 30! mod2^8 is 0, and mod5^8 is 0.

Thus, 30! mod10^8 =0.

Wait, but that can't be right because 30! is not a multiple of 10^8. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the modulus.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 30! mod10^8. But 30! is a multiple of 2^26, which is much larger than 2^8. So, 30! mod2^8 is 0, and 30! mod5^8 is 0.

Wait, but 0 mod10^8 is 0. So 30! mod10^8 is 0. Thus, 30! is a multiple of 10^8, which would imply that 30! has at least 8 trailing zeros, but we know it only has 7. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the modulus. Let's try a different approach.

Since 30! has 7 trailing zeros, I can compute 30! /10^7 mod10.

Which is the same as K mod10, where K = 30! /10^7.

So, K is an integer. I need to find K mod10.

To compute K mod10, perhaps I can compute (30! /10^7) mod10.

Which can be written as (30! mod (10^8)) / (10^7).

But perhaps I can compute 30! mod (10^8) and then divide by 10^7, then take mod10.

Wait, but 30! mod10^8 is 0 because 30! is a multiple of 10^7, but 10^8 is 10 times larger. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I can think of K = 30! /10^7.

So, K = 2^(26-7) * 5^(7-7) * (other primes) = 2^19 * other primes.

Thus, K mod10 is (2^19 mod10) * (product of other primes mod10) mod10.

But 2^19 mod10: as before, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=6, 2^5=2, so period 4. 19 divided by 4 is 4*4=16, remainder 3. So 2^19 mod10=8.

Now, the product of other primes: 3,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,... etc., up to 30, but wait, 30 is included in 30!.

Wait, no, after 30!, the other primes are included. But wait, 30! includes all primes up to 30. So, the other primes in K are the primes greater than 5, including 7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, etc., up to 30.

So, the product P is 7 *11 *13 *17 *19 *23 *29.

Wait, let me compute P step by step.

7 *11 =77.

77 *13=1001.

1001 *17=17017.

17017 *19=323323.

323323 *23=7436429.

7436429 *29=219656441.

So, P=219656441.

Now, K = 2^19 * P.

We need to compute K mod10.

But 2^19 mod10 is 8, and P mod10 is 1.

So, 8 *1 =8 mod10.

Wait, but that would mean K mod10 is 8, so the last non-zero digit before the seven zeros is 8.

But wait, earlier I thought it might be 7 or 3. Hmm, perhaps I should check again.

Wait, but let me think again. K =30! /10^7.

So, 30! is 2^26 *5^7 * (other primes).

So, 30! /10^7 =2^(26-7) *5^(7-7) * (other primes) =2^19 * (other primes).

So, K=2^19 * (other primes).

Now, the other primes are:7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, etc., up to 30.

Wait, but up to 30, the other primes are 7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31 (but 31 is beyond 30, so not included).

So, the product P is 7 *11 *13 *17 *19 *23 *29.

Which is 7436429 as I computed earlier.

Now, K =2^19 * P.

We can compute K mod10 as (2^19 mod10 ) * (P mod10 ) mod10.

2^19 mod10 is 8, P mod10 is 1, so 8 *1 =8 mod10.

Thus, K mod10 is 8.

Wait, but let me confirm this calculation. Because K =30! /10^7, which is 2^19 * (other primes). The other primes are the primes greater than 5 up to 30, which are 7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, etc. Wait, but 31 is not included in 30!.

So, the other primes are 7,11,13,17,19,23,29.

So, P=7*11*13*17*19*23*29.

Which is 7436429.

So, K=2^19 *7436429.

Now, compute K mod10.

Compute 2^19 mod10=8.

Compute 7436429 mod10=9.

Wait, no, 7436429 ends with a 9, so mod10 is 9.

Wait, so K mod10 is (8 *9) mod10=72 mod10=2.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in calculating P mod10.

Wait, P is 7*11*13*17*19*23*29.

Let me compute P mod10 step by step.

7 mod10=7.

7 *11=77 mod10=7.

7 *13=91 mod10=1.

1 *17=17 mod10=7.

7 *19=133 mod10=3.

3 *23=69 mod10=9.

9 *29=261 mod10=1.

Wait, so P mod10=1.

So, K mod10 is (8 *1) mod10=8.

So, that's consistent with the earlier result.

Wait, so the digit before the seven zeros is 8.

But earlier, I thought it might be 7 or 3. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I should check if my approach is correct.

Wait, another way to compute K mod10 is to compute (30! /10^7) mod10.

But 30! /10^7 is equal to (30! / (2^7 *5^7)).

Which is equal to (30! /5^7) /2^7.

Now, 30! /5^7 is an integer, but how to compute it mod10.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (30! /5^7) mod10, then divide by 2^7 mod10.

Wait, but 30! /5^7 mod10 is equal to (30! mod (5^7 *10)) /5^7 mod10.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (30! /5^7) mod10 as follows.

30! = 2^26 *5^7 * (other primes).

So, 30! /5^7 =2^26 * (other primes).

Compute 2^26 mod (5^7 *10).

Wait, 5^7 is 78125, so 5^7 *10 is 781250.

2^26 is 67108864.

Compute 67108864 mod781250.

Divide 67108864 by781250.

781250 *851 = 781250 *800=625000000, 781250*50=39062500, 781250*1=781250. So total is 625000000 +39062500 +781250= 664877750.

But 781250 *851=664877750.

But 67108864 is less than that. So, 67108864 -781250 *851=67108864 -664877750=62211114.

Wait, that can't be right. I think I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 67108864 divided by781250.

781250 × 850 = 781250 × 800 +781250 ×50 = 625000000 +39062500 = 664062500.

67108864 is 67108864, which is less than 664062500. So, 781250 × 850 =664062500.

67108864 -664062500 = 67108864 -664062500= 70263604.

Wait, no, that's not possible. I must be miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute 67108864 /781250.

Well, 781250 × 851 =781250 ×800 +781250×50 +781250×1=625000000 +39062500 +781250=664877750.

But 664877750 is greater than 67108864, so perhaps 781250 × 851 is 664877750, which is more than 67108864. So, 781250 ×850=664062500, which is less than 67108864. So, 67108864 -664062500=7026364.

Wait, but that's not possible. I think I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 67108864 mod781250.

So, 781250 ×851=781250 ×800=625000000, ×50=39062500, ×1=781250. Total is 625000000 +39062500=664062500 +781250=664843750. But 664843750 is less than 67108864.

Wait, no, 664843750 is less than 67108864? No, because 664843750 is a much smaller number than 67108864.

So, 67108864 -664843750=67108864 -664843750=67108864 minus 6,648,43750 is negative. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 67108864 divided by781250.

Well, 781250 ×851=781250 ×800=625000000, plus 781250 ×50=39062500, plus 781250 ×1=781250. So total is 625000000 +39062500=664062500 +781250=664843750.

But 67108864 is much less than that, so 67108864 is 67,108,864.

Wait, but 664,843,750 is 664 million, which is larger than 67,108,864, which is 67 million. So, 67,108,864 is 67 million, and 664 million is much larger. So, 67,108,864 mod781,250 would be 67,108,864 -781,250 ×85= ?

Wait, 781,250 ×85=781,250 ×80=62,500,000 plus 781,250 ×5=3,906,250. So total is 62,500,000 +3,906,250=66,406,250.

Wait, 67,108,864 -66,406,250=702,614.

Wait, so 67,108,864 mod781,250=702,614.

Wait, but that's not correct, because 781,250 ×85=66,406,250.

67,108,864 -66,406,250=702,614.

So, K mod10 is (8 ×1) mod10=8.

Wait, that's the same result as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should accept that the digit before the seven zeros is 8.

But earlier I thought it might be 7 or 3. Hmmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check another approach.

Wait, another approach: compute 30! and divide by 10^7, then take the last digit.

But 30! is a huge number. But perhaps I can compute 30! mod10^8, then divide by10^7, then take mod10.

Wait, but 30! mod10^8 is 0, because 30! is a multiple of 10^7.

So, 30! /10^7 mod10 is 0 mod10=0, but that's not correct because 30! is not a multiple of 10^7, as 30! has 7 factors of 5 and 26 factors of 2, so 30! is 2^26 *5^7 * ... So, 30! /10^7 is 2^19 * (other primes), which is not a multiple of 10, so 30! /10^7 mod10 is not zero.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 30! mod10^8, then divide by10^7, then take mod10.

But 30! mod10^8 is 0, so 30! /10^7 mod10 is 0/10^7 mod10=0, but that's not correct because 30! is not a multiple of 10^7, so the division is not exact.

Wait, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 30! mod10^8, then divide by10^7, then take mod10.

But 30! mod10^8 is 0, so 30! /10^7 mod10 is 0/10^7 mod10=0, but that's incorrect because 30! is not a multiple of 10^7, so the division is not exact.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the digit before seven zeros is 8, as computed earlier.

Wait, but then I'm confused because I thought it might be 7 or 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck my calculations.

Wait, let me compute K mod10 again.

K =30! /10^7 =2^19 * (other primes).

Compute K mod10: 8 *1=8 mod10=8.

So, the digit before seven zeros is 8.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check with an example.

Wait, let me take a smaller number, say 10!.

10! =3,628,800.

Divided by 10^2 (since 10! has two trailing zeros), we get 36288.

The last non-zero digit is 8.

Which aligns with our calculation.

So, in 10!, the digit before two zeros is 8.

Similarly, in 15!, the last non-zero digit before trailing zeros is 8.

Hmm.

Wait, but in 15!, the last non-zero digit before two zeros would be?

Wait, 15! is 1307674368000.

Divided by 10^2, it's 1307674368000/100=13076743680.

The last non-zero digit is 8.

So, same as before.

Wait, but in 10!, the last non-zero digit before two zeros is 8.

Hmm, so perhaps in 30!, it's also 8.

But then, why did I think it might be 7 or 3?

Hmm, perhaps I was thinking of a different problem.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that the digit before seven zeros is 8.

Wait, but let me check another example.

Wait, let's take 100!.

100! has 24 trailing zeros, so the last non-zero digit before 24 zeros is in some way, but perhaps not 8.

Wait, but in the problem, 30! has seven trailing zeros, and I'm computing the digit before seven zeros, which is 8.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my initial thought of 7 or 3 was incorrect.

Hmm.

So, perhaps the digit is 8.

Wait, but let me double-check my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of P mod10.

Wait, let's recompute P mod10.

P is 7 *11 *13 *17 *19 *23 *29.

Compute each step:

Start with 7 mod10=7.

7 *11=77 mod10=7.

7 *13=91 mod10=1.

1 *17=17 mod10=7.

7 *19=133 mod10=3.

3 *23=69 mod10=9.

9 *29=261 mod10=1.

So, P mod10=1.

Thus, K mod10 is (2^19 mod10 * P mod10) mod10= (8 *1) mod10=8.

So, the digit before seven zeros is 8.

Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I should think again about whether this is correct.

Because 30! is a multiple of 10^7, so 30! /10^7 is an integer.

But then, 30! /10^7 mod10 is 8.

So, the digit before seven zeros is 8.

Wait, but in some cases, the digit could be different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 30! is 2^26 *5^7 * ..., so 30! /10^7 is 2^(26-7) *5^(7-7) * ... which is 2^19 * (other primes).

So, the last digit is determined by 2^19 mod10 and the product of the other primes mod10.

Wait, but in my calculation, it's 8.

Wait, so perhaps the answer is 8.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that 8 is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure why earlier I thought it might be 7 or 3.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem again.

Wait, the problem is: find the digit before seven trailing zeros in 30!.

Alternatively, find the digit at position 3 in 30!.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is ambiguous.

Wait, but perhaps the digit at the position 3 in 30! would be the same as the digit before seven zeros.

Wait, perhaps not.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the digit before seven zeros as the digit that is in the 30th digit or something.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should stick to the initial calculation, which is 8.

So, perhaps the answer is 8.

Hmm.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 2^19 mod10.

As 2^1 mod10=2.

2^2=4.

2^3=8.

2^4=6.

2^5=2.

Then the cycle repeats every 4.

So, 19 divided by4 is 4 with remainder 3.

So, 2^19 mod10=2^(4*4 +3)= (2^4)^4 *2^3 mod10=6^4 *8 mod10.

Wait, 6^1 mod10=6.

6^2=36 mod10=6.

6^3=216 mod10=6.

6^4=1296 mod10=6.

So, 6^4 mod10=6.

Thus, 2^19 mod10=6*8=48 mod10=8.

So, that's correct.

Thus, K mod10=8.

So, the answer is 8.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps that's correct.

Thus, I should accept that the digit before seven trailing zeros in 30! is 8.

Therefore, the answer is 8.

**Final Answer**
The digit before seven trailing zeros in \(30!\) is \boxed{8}.
</think>

To find the digit before seven trailing zeros in \(30!\), we need to determine the last non-zero digit of \(30!\) before seven zeros.

1. **Calculate \(30!\) modulo \(10^8\)**:
   - \(30!\) is a multiple of \(10^7\) because it has 7 factors of 2 and 7 factors of 5.
   - Therefore, \(30! \mod 10^8 = 0\).

2. **Divide \(30!\) by \(10^7\)**:
   - Since \(30!\) is a multiple of \(10^7\), we need to find the last non-zero digit of \(30! / 10^7\).

3. **Compute \(30! / 10^7\) modulo 10**:
   - \(30! / 10^7 = 2^{19} \times \text{other primes}\).
   - Calculate \(2^{19} \mod 10\):
     - The powers of 2 modulo 10 cycle every 4: 2, 4, 8, 6.
     - \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), so \(2^{19} \mod 10 = 8\).
   - Calculate the product of other primes modulo 10:
     - The product of other primes modulo 10 is 1.
   - Combine the results: \(8 \times 1 \mod 10 = 8\).

Thus, the last non-zero digit before seven trailing zeros in \(30!\) is \(\boxed{8}\).
