Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the consequences of removing a protective tariff on imported steel. I need to figure out which of the options A to J is correct. Let me try to break this down.

First, I should understand what a protective tariff is. From what I remember, a protective tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods to protect domestic producers from foreign competition. It prevents foreign buyers from getting a good deal on imported products. So, when a protective tariff is removed, the market should become more competitive because there's no protection.

Now, the question is about the consequences of removing this protective tariff. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: The quality of imported steel decreases. I don't think removing a protective tariff would affect the quality of imported steel. It's more about the price and availability. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: Domestic steel producers lose their jobs. If the protection is lifted, more domestic production might become available, which could lead to more job creation. So B might not be the consequence but more of a result.

Option C: Income transferred from domestic consumers to foreign producers. Wait, when you remove a protective tariff, foreign consumers might find imported goods more affordable. This would increase demand for imports, which could drive up their prices. So perhaps domestic consumers buy more imports, so the demand for imported steel increases. That would mean foreign producers get more income, so C seems correct.

Option D: Income transferred from consumers to domestic producers. Hmm, when imports become more affordable, domestic consumers might buy more imports, which could drive up the price of steel. If domestic consumers can buy more, the demand for domestically produced steel might decrease. So that would mean domestic producers have less demand, leading to a possible decrease in production. But the question is about income transfer. If domestic consumers are buying more imports, that would be a shift towards imports, not domestic producers. So perhaps D is incorrect.

Option E: Allocative efficiency is improved. Allocative efficiency is when resources are allocated in the best possible way to maximize overall societal value. If the market is more competitive, allocative efficiency should increase, so E is a possibility.

Option F: Imports fall. If the tariff is lifted, imports become more affordable, so it's likely that imports increase, not fall. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Price of imported steel increases. Wait, that's the opposite of what happens when a protective tariff is removed. With a protective tariff, imported goods are taxed, so their prices are higher. Removing the tariff would reduce this tax, so the price of imports would decrease. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Income transferred from foreign to domestic producers. Wait, when imports become cheaper, domestic consumers might buy more imports, which could lead to foreign producers getting more revenue. But it's not the same as transferring income from foreign producers to domestic. The direction seems a bit off. So H might not be correct.

Option I: The supply of domestic steel decreases. If the price of imported steel decreases, domestic producers might not need as much, so supply could decrease. So I is a possibility.

Option J: Demand for domestic steel increases. If the price of imported steel goes down, domestic consumers might buy more, increasing demand. So J is a possibility.

Now, looking back at the options, the correct answer should consider both supply and demand impacts.

When a protective tariff is removed, the domestic market becomes more competitive. So domestic steel producers can produce more, leading to supply decreasing (I). But what about demand? Higher imports would increase demand, so domestic consumers buy more (J). 

Looking at the options, both I and J are possible. But the question asks for a consequence. Which one is the direct result of the removal.

Wait, the question is about the consequences of removal. So the correct answer would be both I and J. But the options don't have an E is correct and I and J are correct. But the options are individual letters, so which is the consequence.

Wait, the options are individual statements, so each option is a possible consequence. But the question is "which of the following is a consequence".

The answer choices are A to J.

So, when the protective tariff is removed, the market becomes more competitive, leading to:

- The supply of domestic steel decreases (I) because more production.
- The demand for domestic steel increases (J) because more imports are available.

So both I and J are consequences. But looking at the options, the correct answer is possibly I and J. Let me see the options again.

Wait, the question lists each as a separate option. So which of the options is a consequence. Let me check which options are correct.

The question is about the consequences. So which of the options is a direct result.

From what I know, removing a protective tariff leads to more domestic production (I), so option I is correct, and also, imports become cheaper, increasing demand for domestic steel (J), so J is correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the question is looking for a specific answer.

Wait, looking at the options again, the correct consequences are I and J, but I don't see both being presented. Wait, no, the options are separate. So the answer choices are individual, so the correct answer is I is correct and J is correct. But the options are each a possible consequence.

Wait, but the options are:

E: Allocative efficiency is improved.

This is correct because removing the protection would lead to more efficient use of resources, so E is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the consequence of the removal, so E is a correct consequence.

Wait, but the options are separate, so each is a consequence. So which of the options are correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to think about what happens when a protective tariff is removed.

A protective tariff: it's a tax that prevents foreign goods from entering the market. So when the tariff is removed, the protection is lifted, allowing foreign goods to enter. So the market becomes more competitive.

So the consequences include:

- Domestic production increases (so option I is correct).

- Imports increase (so option F is incorrect, but what about option J? If imports increase, domestic consumers can buy more, so J is correct).

- Domestic demand for steel increases (so J is correct).

- Domestic supply decreases (I is correct).

- The price of imported steel decreases (so G is incorrect).

- The price of domestic steel decreases (since imports are cheaper, domestic price might go down, so G is incorrect).

Now, looking at the options, which of the provided options (A to J) is a consequence.

So the consequences are:

- Domestic supply decreases (I: correct).

- Domestic demand increases (J: correct).

- Foreign producers' income increases (because more imports) (so H is correct).

Wait, but H says income is transferred from foreign to domestic. Wait, when imports become cheaper, domestic consumers buy more, so perhaps foreign producers get more of the product, so their income would increase. But the question is about the transfer from foreign to domestic, is that correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the direction. If a protective tariff is removed, the price of imported steel decreases. So domestic consumers would buy more, which might affect domestic producers. If domestic consumers buy more imports, domestic producers might have more demand for domestic steel, which could lead to increased production (so I is correct). But the transfer of income would be from foreign to domestic. So H says it's the opposite.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The protective tariff is on imported goods. If the tariff is removed, the price of imports drops. So domestic consumers can buy more imports. So the demand for domestic steel increases (J is correct), which would cause domestic producers to have more demand, leading to more production (I is correct). But what about the income transfer?

Domestic consumers buying more imports might lead to a shift in the demand curve for imported goods, which in turn affects the supply of domestic goods. So when the price of imports (a foreign good) decreases, the demand for domestic goods (like steel) increases. That's because consumers now have more income to spend on both imported and domestic goods.

This transfer of demand from imports to domestic goods is due to the price change, not necessarily a transfer of income from foreign to domestic producers. So H is incorrect.

So looking back, which options are correct.

I: The supply of domestic steel decreases. Correct.

J: The demand for domestic steel increases. Correct.

H: Income transferred from foreign to domestic. Incorrect.

E: Allocative efficiency is improved. Correct, because with more competition, resources are used more efficiently.

Wait, but the question is which is a consequence of the removal. So all the correct options would be I, J, E, H.

Wait, wait, the options are separate. The question is which consequence is correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each is a possible consequence.

So the correct consequences are I, J, and E. But the options don't have E as an individual correct answer. Wait, looking at the options, the correct answer would be E is correct, and I, J, and others.

Wait, but let me think about the options again.

The correct answer options are:

E: allocative efficiency improved → correct.

H: income transferred from foreign to domestic → incorrect. It's the opposite.

So which of the options is correct.

In the context of the question, the correct answer is that removing the protective tariff leads to the supply of domestic steel decreasing, and the demand for domestic steel increasing. So I and J are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only I is correct among the options, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about consequences of the removal, so which of the options is a consequence.

Looking at the options, the question is asking for consequences. So which of the options is correct.

So the options are:

A: quality decreases → not correct.

B: domestic producers lose jobs → not correct.

C: income transferred from domestic to foreign → no, it's the opposite.

D: income from consumers to domestic producers → not correct.

E: allocative efficiency improved → correct.

F: imports fall → no.

G: price of imported increases → no.

H: foreign to domestic → no.

I: supply decreases → correct.

J: demand increases → correct.

So I, J, E, H are correct consequences.

But the options are separate. The question is which consequence is correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, each is a possible consequence.

So the correct answer is E, because removing the protective tariff leads to improved allocative efficiency. But E is a consequence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the correct answer involves both I and J.

Wait, but the options are each a single consequence. So perhaps the question is looking for both consequences, but the options are individual.

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is E and I and J are correct, but that's not possible because the options are single letters.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering one consequence, and the options are given in such a way that the correct is E or I or J.

Wait, but the question is which consequence is correct. So perhaps the correct answers are E and I and J, but I don't see all of them in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E (allocative efficiency) is correct because without protection, resources are more efficiently used.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach.

When a protective tariff is removed, the market becomes more competitive. So:

- Domestic demand for steel increases → J is correct.

- Domestic supply decreases because more domestic production is possible → I is correct.

- The price of imported steel may decrease → so G is incorrect.

- Domestic consumers can buy more imports → so J is correct.

- Domestic producers have more demand → I is correct.

- The protective tariff was meant to prevent foreign goods from entering, so removing it opens up the market to more imports. This leads to a shift in the demand curve for imported goods, which affects the supply of domestic goods. This is a result of the market becoming more competitive.

- Allocative efficiency is improved because resources are used where they are most valued. So E is correct.

So all of I, J, E are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is E and I, but in the options, only E is A to J.

Wait, the options are given as individual consequences. So E is a consequence, as is I and J.

In the context of the question, which asks which is a consequence, the correct answer would be E, I, and J.

But looking at the options, each is a separate possible answer. So perhaps the correct answer is E and I are correct.

Wait, no, let me look at the options again. The options are presented as A to J, each a statement. So each is a possible consequence.

So the correct answer should include all correct consequences. But the options are not combined. So perhaps the question is looking for the most correct statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E and I are correct. But among the options given, which are correct.

Wait, another thought: when the protective tariff is removed, the price of imported steel decreases. So domestic consumers buy more imports, which means the demand for domestic steel increases. So J is correct.

The supply of domestic steel decreases because more domestic production is possible. So I is correct.

So the consequences are J and I.

Looking at the options, the correct answers would be I and J. But the options are separate, so the question is, which of the options is a consequence. So both I and J are consequences.

But the options are individual letters. So perhaps the answer is E and I. But the options are separate, so perhaps I and J are correct.

Wait, but the options are E, I, J, H as consequences, but only E is an individual option.

Wait, but the question might be asking which of the following is a consequence. So all correct statements are I, J, E, H. But the options are each a possible consequence.

So the question is, which of the following is a consequence. So all four (I, J, E, H) are consequences, but only some are provided as options, so the correct answer would be E, I, J, or H.

But the options are individual letters, so perhaps only E is correct, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the options.

The options are:

A: quality decreases → no.

B: Producers lose jobs → no.

C: Income transferred from domestic to foreign → no.

D: Income transferred from consumers to domestic → no.

E: Allocative efficiency improved → yes.

F: Imports fall → no.

G: Price of imported increases → no.

H: Income transferred from foreign to domestic → no.

I: Supply decreases → yes.

J: Demand increases → yes.

So, both I and J are consequences. E is also correct.

But the question is which is a consequence. So E, I, J are correct.

But looking at the options, the answer is multiple letters, but the options are given as single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is E and I, but the options are giving each as a separate possibility.

Wait, but the options are not combined, so perhaps the correct answer is E and I.

But in the given options, the correct answer is E and I.

Wait, the options are A-J, each a possible consequence.

So the correct answer would be E and I as consequences, but the options don't have two letters. So I'm probably overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to check what the textbook says. For example, I remember that when a protective tariff is removed, the market becomes more competitive, leading to:

- Domestic demand for steel increases → J is correct.

- Domestic supply decreases → I is correct.

- Allocative efficiency improves → E is correct.

So the correct answer is E, I, and J. But the options don't have all three, only each as a possible consequence.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the correct answer is E, I, and J. But the options are given as individual. So perhaps E and I are both correct, but looking for the best option, which is E.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E and I. But the options are letters, so the correct answer is E and I. But the question is which consequence is correct. So perhaps the correct answers are E and I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E and I, but let me see.

Wait, the question is: Which of the following is a consequence of the removal of a protective tariff on imported steel?

So all correct consequences would be I, J, E, and H, but only some are letters. But among the options, E is a correct consequence, and I is a correct consequence.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose the domestic price of steel was P. With a protective tariff, P was higher. If you remove the tariff, P decreases. So domestic consumers buy more, so domestic demand increases (J correct). Domestic producers have more demand, so supply decreases (I correct). allocative efficiency improves because the market is more efficient (E correct).

So the correct consequences are E, I, and J.

But the options are separate, so the correct answer is E, I, and J. But since the options are individual, the answer would be E, I, and J, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the intended answer is E and I.

Wait, but the options are letters, so perhaps each correct option is a consequence, and the correct answer is E and I.

But perhaps the question is looking for E and I. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E and I, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E is correct, and I is correct, but J isn't a consequence.

Wait, no. J is correct. So perhaps the correct answers are E and I.

But the options are letters, so the correct answer is E and I. But the question is which is a consequence. So perhaps the correct answers are E and I.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is E and I.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: think about the options. The correct answer is E, I, and J.

But since the options are individual, the correct answer is E, I, and J. But the options don't combine. So perhaps the answer is E and I.

Wait, the options are A-J, each a possible consequence. So the correct answer would be E and I as consequences, but since it's a single-choice question, perhaps the correct answer is E and I. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E and I. So the answer is E and I, but how to represent that in the option letters. But the options are presented as individual letters, so perhaps each is correct.

Wait, but in reality, the correct answer would be E, I, and J, but the question only provides each as an option. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is E and I.

But I'm not fully confident. I think I'll go with E and I being correct consequences.
</think>

The correct answer is that removing a protective tariff on imported steel leads to the following consequences:

- **E**: Allocative efficiency is improved. This is correct because without a protective tariff, resources are used more efficiently.

- **I**: The supply of domestic steel decreases. This is correct because with a protective tariff, imported steel was taxed, reducing its supply. When the tariff is removed, domestic production increases, leading to a decrease in domestic steel supply.

- **J**: The demand for domestic steel increases. This is correct because with a protective tariff, imported steel was taxed, increasing the demand for domestic steel. When the tariff is removed, imported steel becomes cheaper, increasing the demand for domestic steel.

However, since the options are presented as individual consequences, the correct answers are **E**, **I**, and **J**. But given the structure of the question, the best answer is **E** and **I**.

ANSWER: E, I
