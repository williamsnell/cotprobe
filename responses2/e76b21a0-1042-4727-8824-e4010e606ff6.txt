Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Scaccioborrows borrowing $100 and paying back $20 a month with a 1% interest on the unpaid balance. I'm trying to figure out how much he actually pays in total. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the initial amount he borrows is $100. Each month, he's supposed to pay $20, but the interest is 1% on the unpaid balance. So, each month, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance, not the original $100. That means the amount he's actually paying each month isn't just $20, but a bit more due to interest.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says $20 a month with 1% interest. So does the $20 include the interest, or is it a fixed amount that covers the interest each month? Hmm. Let me read it again. It says he agrees to pay back $20 a month with interest of 1% per month on the unpaid balance. So maybe the $20 includes the interest, but that doesn't quite make sense because the interest would be 1% of the balance, not the amount he's paying.

Wait, perhaps it's that each month, the interest is 1% of the unpaid balance, and then he pays $20, which is the amount to cover both the interest and part of the principal. So the total he pays each month is $20, but the $20 might be more than just the interest. Because if he pays $20 each month, that's more than 1% of the previous balance. Let me think in terms of an example.

Let me calculate the first few months to see what's happening. 

Starting balance: $100.

Month 1:

Interest = 1% of 100 = $1. So the unpaid balance after interest is $101.

He has to pay $20. So, does he pay $20, which covers the interest and part of the principal. So he would pay $1 interest and $19 principal.

Wait, but does the $20 include the interest, or is it just the principal? The question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read: "Agrees to pay back $20 a month with interest of 1% per month on the unpaid balance." Hmm, that seems like the $20 is the total payment each month, which includes the interest. So the interest is calculated on the balance, and the $20 covers part of the principal and the interest. Or is the $20 the amount to cover the interest and the rest of the principal? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as each month, the interest is 1% of the unpaid balance, and then he pays $20, which is the sum of the interest and whatever part goes towards the principal. So each month:

1. Calculate interest: 1% of current balance.
2. Add that to the balance to get the new balance before payment.
3. Subtract the $20 payment from that new balance, which gives the new balance for next month.

So, let's apply this step by step.

Initial balance: $100.

Month 1:

Interest = 1% of 100 = $1. So balance after interest: $101.
He pays $20, so payment covers the interest and part of the principal. So he would pay $1 as interest and $19 as principal. So the new balance is 101 - 19 = 82.

Month 2:

Balance is $82.

Interest = 1% of 82 = $0.82. So balance after interest: 82.82.
He pays $20. So he pays $0.82 as interest and 19.18 as principal? Wait, but the payment is $20, so 0.82 is interest, and the rest goes to principal.

Wait, 82.82 - 20 = 62.82. So the new balance is 62.82.

Month 3:

Balance is $62.82.

Interest = 1% of 62.82 = 0.6282, approximately $0.63.

Balance after interest: 62.82 + 0.63 = 63.45.

Payment of $20: So 63.45 - 20 = 43.45. So balance is now $43.45.

Month 4:

Interest = 1% of 43.45 = ~0.4345, so $0.43.

Balance after interest: 43.45 + 0.43 = 43.88.

Payment of $20: 43.88 - 20 = 23.88.

Month 5:

Interest = 1% of 23.88 = ~0.2388, so $0.24.

Balance after interest: 23.88 + 0.24 = 24.12.

Payment of $20: 24.12 - 20 = 4.12.

Month 6:

Interest = 1% of 4.12 = ~0.0412, so $0.04.

Balance after interest: 4.12 + 0.04 = 4.16.

Payment of $20: 4.16 - 20 = negative, which doesn't make sense. So, in reality, he would pay the remaining balance in the last month.

Wait, so let's see: After month 5, the balance is $4.12. In month 6, he would pay $20, but he only has $4.12, so he pays all of it. So the total payment is 5 months * $20 each plus the last payment.

Wait, but let's calculate the exact amounts.

But perhaps this way is getting complicated. Maybe there's a formula I can use. Since it's a recurring payment with interest, it's an example of the loan repayment formula. The formula for the remaining balance after each payment is:

Remaining balance = Previous balance * (1 + interest rate) - payment.

But in this case, the payment is larger than the interest each month. So the balance decreases each month.

Alternatively, since the interest is 1% per month, and the payment is $20, which covers the interest and part of the principal.

Wait, but maybe we can model it with the total amount he pays.

Each month, he's paying $20. So over 5 months (since in month 6, he pays the remaining balance), he's paid 5 * $20 = $100, plus the last payment of $4.12, totaling $104.12.

Wait, but let me check how many months he needs to pay to clear the balance.

Wait, in month 5, the balance was $4.12. Then in month 6, he pays $20, which covers that, so the total payment is 5 * $20 + $4.12 = $100 + $4.12 = $104.12.

But let me see the options given don't include $104.12. The options are up to $112 and $103. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate each month step-by-step again more accurately.

Starting balance: $100.

Month 1:

Interest: 100 * 0.01 = $1. So balance after interest: $101.

Payment: $20. So principal paid: $20 - $1 = $19. New balance: $101 - $19 = $82.

Month 2:

Interest: 82 * 0.01 = $0.82. Balance after interest: 82.82.

Payment: $20. Principal paid: $20 - $0.82 = $19.18. New balance: 82.82 - 19.18 = 63.64.

Month 3:

Interest: 63.64 * 0.01 = ~0.6364. Balance after interest: 63.64 + 0.6364 = 64.2764.

Payment: $20. Principal paid: 20 - 0.6364 = 19.3636. New balance: 64.2764 - 19.3636 = 44.9128.

Month 4:

Interest: 44.9128 * 0.01 = ~0.4491. Balance after interest: 44.9128 + 0.4491 = 45.3619.

Payment: $20. Principal paid: 20 - 0.4491 = 19.5509. New balance: 45.3619 - 19.5509 = 25.8110.

Month 5:

Interest: 25.8110 * 0.01 = ~0.2581. Balance after interest: 25.8110 + 0.2581 = 26.0691.

Payment: $20. Principal paid: 20 - 0.2581 = 19.7419. New balance: 26.0691 - 19.7419 = 6.3272.

Month 6:

Balance is $6.3272.

Interest: 6.3272 * 0.01 = ~0.063272. So balance after interest: 6.3272 + 0.063272 = 6.390472.

In month 6, he pays $20. So he pays all the remaining balance. So total payment is 5 * $20 + $6.390472 ≈ $106.39.

Looking back at the options, the closest is E: $106.00. But wait, the exact calculation gives about $106.39, which is approximately $106.40. But the options don't have this. Let me check the calculation again to see if I made an error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in month 5. Let me recalculate month 5:

After month 4, balance is $25.8110.

Interest: 25.8110 * 0.01 = 0.25811 → balance becomes 25.8110 + 0.25811 = 26.06911.

Payment is $20. So principal paid is 20 - 0.25811 = 19.74189. New balance: 26.06911 - 19.74189 = 6.32722.

Month 6: balance is 6.32722.

Interest: 6.32722 * 0.01 = 0.0632722. So balance after interest: 6.32722 + 0.0632722 = 6.3904922.

He pays $20, so the payment covers the 6.3904922 balance. So the total is (5 *20) + 6.3904922 ≈ 100 +6.3905 = $106.3905.

But the options don't have this. The options are:

A:120.00

B:115

C:110

D:100

E:106.00

F:101

G:105

H:112

I:108

J:103

Wait, option E is $106.00, which is the closest to our $106.39. But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the steps. Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit different.

Wait, another possibility is that the interest is 1% per month on the unpaid balance, and he pays $20 each month, but the $20 is the interest plus part of the principal. So perhaps the payment is $20, which includes part of the principal and the interest.

Wait, but in that case, the way to calculate is to model each month's payment.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the first payment is $20, but the interest is 1%, and each subsequent month the interest is calculated on the remaining balance.

Wait, let me model it this way. Let me think of it as the first payment is $20, but the interest is 1% on the balance. So the balance after month 1 is $100 * 1.01 - $20 = $101 - $20 = $81.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, perhaps the first month, the unpaid balance is $100. The interest is 1% of 100, which is $1. So the balance after interest is $101. He pays $20. So the principal paid is $19, making the remaining balance $101 - $20 = $81.

In the next month, $81 is the balance. The interest is 1% of 81, which is $0.81. So the balance after interest is 81.81. He pays $20, so the principal paid is $20 - $0.81 = $19.19. So new balance is 81.81 - 20 = 61.81.

Month 3: balance is 61.81. Interest is 0.6181, balance after interest 62.4281. Payment is $20, so principal paid 19.4181. New balance: 62.4281 - 20 = 42.4281.

Month 4: balance 42.4281. Interest 0.424281, so balance 42.85238. Payment $20, principal paid 19.4285238. New balance: 42.85238 - 20 = 22.85238.

Month 5: balance 22.85238. Interest 0.2285238, so balance 23.0809. Payment $20, principal paid 19.0809. New balance: 23.0809 -20 = 3.0809.

Month 6: balance is 3.0809. Interest is 0.030809, so balance becomes 3.1117. He pays $20, which covers the entire balance. So total payment is 5 * 20 + 3.0809 ≈ 100 +3.0809= $103.0809. So approximately $103.08. But the options don't have this. Hmm, in the options, option J is $103.00.

Wait, but in my first approach, I got around $106.39, and in this case, $103.08. So why the discrepancy? Because in the first approach, I considered the principal paid each month as (payment - interest), but in reality, the payment is fixed at $20 each month. So in the second approach, the payment is fixed, so each month the principal paid is 20 - interest.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me re-examine:

First approach:

Month 1: balance 100. Interest 1.00. balance 101. Payment 20. Principal paid 20 - 1=19. So new balance 82.

Month 2: balance 82. interest 0.82. balance 82.82. payment 20. principal paid 20 -0.82=19.18. new balance 63.64.

Month3: balance 63.64. interest 0.6364. balance 64.2764. payment 20. principal paid 20 - 0.6364=19.3636. new balance 44.9128.

Month4: balance 44.9128. interest 0.449128. balance 45.3619. payment 20. principal paid 20 - 0.449128=19.550872. new balance 25.811028.

Month5: balance 25.811028. interest 0.25811028. balance 26.069138. payment 20. principal paid 20 -0.25811028=19.74189. new balance 6.327248.

Month6: balance 6.327248. interest 0.06327248. balance 6.39052. payment 20. So total paid is 5*20 +6.39052=106.3905, which is approximately $106.39.

But the options don't have that. The closest is E: $106.00.

So why is the total payment E: $106.00? Because in my first approach, I thought of the payments as including the interest, but in reality, the payment is fixed at $20. So the calculation is as I did in the second approach, which gives approximately $106.39. Therefore, the correct answer should be E: $106.00.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in the second approach, the payment is $20 each month, which is fixed, not including the interest. So the first approach might have a mistake because in that approach, the payment is considered to include the interest, but actually, it's fixed.

So the correct answer is $106.00, which is option E.

Wait, but why in the second approach, the total is $106.39, which is more than option E. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation in the second approach.

Let me recalculate the second approach more accurately.

Month1:

Balance: 100.

Interest: 100 * 0.01 = 1.00.

Balance after interest: 101.00.

Payment: 20.00.

Principal paid: 20.00 - 1.00 = 19.00.

Remaining balance: 101.00 - 19.00 = 82.00.

Month2:

Balance: 82.00.

Interest: 82.00 * 0.01 = 0.82.

Balance after interest: 82.82.

Payment: 20.00.

Principal paid: 20.00 - 0.82 = 19.18.

Remaining balance: 82.82 - 19.18 = 63.64.

Month3:

Balance: 63.64.

Interest: 63.64 * 0.01 = 0.6364.

Balance after interest: 63.64 + 0.6364 = 64.2764.

Payment: 20.00.

Principal paid: 20.00 - 0.6364 = 19.3636.

Remaining balance: 64.2764 - 19.3636 = 44.9128.

Month4:

Balance: 44.9128.

Interest: 44.9128 * 0.01 = 0.449128.

Balance after interest: 44.9128 + 0.449128 = 45.361928.

Payment: 20.00.

Principal paid: 20.00 - 0.449128 = 19.550872.

Remaining balance: 45.361928 - 19.550872 = 25.811056.

Month5:

Balance: 25.811056.

Interest: 25.811056 * 0.01 = 0.25811056.

Balance after interest: 25.811056 + 0.25811056 = 26.06916656.

Payment: 20.00.

Principal paid: 20.00 - 0.25811056 = 19.74188944.

Remaining balance: 26.06916656 - 19.74188944 = 6.32727712.

Month6:

Balance: 6.32727712.

Interest: 6.32727712 * 0.01 = 0.0632727712.

Balance after interest: 6.32727712 + 0.0632727712 = 6.39055.

Payment: 20.00.

Total payment: 5 * 20 + 6.39055 = 100 +6.39055 = 106.39055.

So the total amount paid is approximately $106.39. But the given options are:

E: $106.00

So the closest is E: $106.00.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in the first approach, I considered the principal paid each month as payment minus interest. But in reality, the payment is fixed at $20, so the principal paid each month is 20 minus the interest on the current balance.

So in the second approach, the total payment is 106.39, and the closest option is E: $106.00.

Therefore, the correct answer is option E: $106.00.

Wait, but wait—another thought: perhaps the problem is that the first payment is $20, which includes the interest. So perhaps the way to model it is that the first payment covers part of the principal and the interest.

But in that case, the remaining balance is calculated each month.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the payment is $20, and the interest is 1% per month, and the balance is being calculated each month. But in that case, the first payment would reduce the balance, and the second payment would be the interest plus part of the principal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it using the present value formula. The total amount Mr. Sc.clip would have to pay is equal to the present value of the loan plus the interest. Wait, but the problem is that the loan is being repaid with fixed payments each month, so the total amount he pays is the sum of all the payments. Since each payment is $20, and he makes 5 payments, that's $100, plus the final payment of $4.12, so total $104.12. But this isn't an option either.

So perhaps I need to model it step by step, as I did earlier, and find that the correct answer is $106.00.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the first payment is $20, which includes the 1% interest, and the remaining balance is $98. So each month, the unpaid balance is 98, 97.02, etc. But that approach might not be correct.

But in the earlier step-by-step approach, the total amount he pays is $106.39, which is approximately $106.00. So the correct answer is E: $106.00.

So I think the correct answer is option E.
</think>

Mr. Sc.clip borrows $100 and agrees to pay back $20 each month, including the 1% interest on the unpaid balance. Let's calculate the total payment step by step.

1. **Month 1:**
   - Balance: $100
   - Interest: $1 (1% of $100)
   - Balance after interest: $101
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal paid: $19
   - Remaining balance: $82

2. **Month 2:**
   - Balance: $82
   - Interest: $0.82 (1% of $82)
   - Balance after interest: $82.82
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal paid: $19.18
   - Remaining balance: $63.64

3. **Month 3:**
   - Balance: $63.64
   - Interest: $0.6364 (1% of $63.64)
   - Balance after interest: $64.2764
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal paid: $19.3636
   - Remaining balance: $44.9128

4. **Month 4:**
   - Balance: $44.9128
   - Interest: $0.449128 (1% of $44.9128)
   - Balance after interest: $45.361928
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal paid: $19.550872
   - Remaining balance: $25.811056

5. **Month 5:**
   - Balance: $25.811056
   - Interest: $0.25811056 (1% of $25.811056)
   - Balance after interest: $26.06916656
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal paid: $19.74188944
   - Remaining balance: $6.32727712

6. **Month 6:**
   - Balance: $6.32727712
   - Interest: $0.0632727712 (1% of $6.32727712)
   - Balance after interest: $6.39055
   - Payment: $20
   - Principal paid: $19.74188944
   - Remaining balance: $6.32727712

Total payment: $5 * $20 + $6.39055 = $100 + $6.39055 = $106.39055.

Since the closest option is $106.00, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: E
