Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient's defense mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The patient is a 14-year-old girl who's been really upset about her mother. She learned her mom started having sex with various partners one month ago. She doesn't use condoms or contraception, which is concerning. Her mom is worried about her behavior, which is a bit unexpected. 

The patient's parents have separated three months ago. She was an honor student and excelled in school before the separation. But now, since the separation, she's been sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She's smoking cigarettes, not following curfew, and is truant from school. 

The question is asking which defense mechanism she's most likely using. The options are various, like Acting out, Intellectualization, Projection, etc.

First, I need to understand what defense mechanisms are. From what I remember, defense mechanisms are psychological strategies a person uses to cope with stress or negative emotions. They include things like talking to a friend, seeking help, denial, projection, regression, etc.

Looking at the patient's situation: she's upset because her mother's behavior is concerning. She's acting out because of her mother's actions. But her own behavior—sullen, defiant, smoking, truant—seems more indicative of a deeper issue, maybe not just her mother's actions. 

Projection is when someone interprets others' emotions or actions as their own. So, if the mom's actions are causing her to feel upset, she might project that emotion onto herself. For example, thinking that her mother's actions are causing her to feel this way. That seems like a possible defense.

Alternatively, denial is when someone hides the emotions they feel. But in this case, the patient is clearly upset and acting out, which suggests denial might not be the main issue. She's not hiding her feelings; she's showing her frustration.

She's also slogging through her own problems because of her mother's behavior. That could be a sign ofProjection. She's projecting her mother's actions onto herself, thinking that her own actions are causing the problem.

Another option is regression, which is when someone tries to change their behavior to fit a new situation, but in this case, she's staying in her current state, not trying to change.

Rationalization is making up reasons for feeling a certain way, which doesn't seem to fit here. She's not making up her feelings; she's acting out.

Displacement is when someone moves out of a place they were living in, not sure where they are now. That doesn't seem to apply here.

I think the main issue is her own behavior, which is a reflection of her mother's actions. So she's projecting her mother's behavior onto herself. That would make projection the answer.

Wait, but the options include Displacement, Displacement is when you leave your current place, which is not related. She's not moving. So probably not Displacement.

Another option is Rationalization, but that's about making up reasons, which doesn't fit.

So between Projection and maybe another. Another possibility is that she's acting out, but that's more about physical acts. The question is about defense mechanisms, not her actions. So probably, she's projecting her mother's actions onto herself.

So the answer should be Projection, which is option H.

The patient is most likely using **Projection** as a defense mechanism. This occurs when someone interprets others' actions or emotions as their own. In this case, she is projecting the effects of her mother's behavior onto herself, leading to her frustration and actions.

Answer: H
