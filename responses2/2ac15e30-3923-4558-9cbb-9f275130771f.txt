Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the pressure in a tank when the temperature changes. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the air pressure in a tank is 640 mm Hg at 23°C. When placed in sunlight, the temperature rises to 48°C. I need to find the new pressure. The options are given from A to J, with various values.

Hmm, I remember that when the temperature of a gas changes, assuming the volume and amount of gas don't change, the pressure changes according to Charles's Law. Oh wait, Charles's Law says that volume is directly proportional to temperature when pressure is constant. But wait, here we're dealing with pressure and temperature changes. Oh right, the combined gas law applies here. The law is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. But wait, temperature is in Kelvin when using the combined gas law, right.

So first, I need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin. Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So, 23°C is 23 + 273.15 = 296.15 K. The final temperature is 48°C, which is 48 + 273.15 = 321.15 K.

Now, the volume remains the same because the problem doesn't mention any change in volume, and the tank is presumably sealed, so the volume doesn't change. So V1 = V2, which simplifies the equation to P1 / T1 = P2 / T2.

So, P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1)

Plugging in the numbers: P2 = 640 mm Hg * (321.15 / 296.15)

Let me calculate that. Let's compute 321.15 divided by 296.15. Hmm, 296.15 is about 296, so 321.15/296 is roughly 1.086. Let me do it more accurately.

Calculating 321.15 ÷ 296.15:

296.15 * 1 = 296.15. Subtract from 321.15: 25.00 left. So 1.086 times? Wait, let me do it properly.

Wait, 296.15 * 1.086 = ?

Alternatively, I'll just approximate. Let me compute 321.15 / 296.15.

Let me see, 296.15 * 1.086 equals 296.15 * 1 + 296.15 * 0.086.

296.15 * 1 = 296.15; 0.086 is 86/1000. So 296.15 * 0.08 = 23.692, and 296.15 * 0.006=1.7769. So 23.692 +1.7769=25.4689. Add to 296.15: 296.15+25.4689=321.6189. So 296.15 * 1.086 ≈321.62, which is a bit higher than 321.15. So maybe the actual value is a bit less than 1.086. Let me compute 321.15 / 296.15.

Let me write it out as decimals:

Dividing 321.15 by 296.15.

Let me do it step by step.

296.15 | 321.15

How many times does 296.15 go into 321.15? It's approximately 1.085 times because 296.15 * 1.085 = ?

Wait, let me do the calculation properly. Let's compute 321.15 ÷ 296.15.

I can write this as (321.15 / 296.15) ≈ 1.086. But let's compute it more accurately.

Let me set it up as a division problem.

296.15 ) 321.15

296.15 fits once into 321.15, as I said. Subtract 296.15 from 321.15: 321.15 -296.15 = 25.00.

Bring down the next digit? Wait, no, because it's a decimal division. So 25.00 is the remainder. Now, bring down a zero: 250.00.

How many times does 296.15 go into 250? 0 times. So we add a decimal and another zero: 2500.00.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use a calculator method here, but since I can't, I'll approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach. Let me think, perhaps it's about 1.086. Let's proceed with that.

So P2 = 640 * 1.086 ≈ 640 * 1.086.

Compute 640 * 1 = 640.

640 * 0.08 = 51.2.

640 * 0.006 = 3.84.

Adding them up: 640 +51.2=691.2; 691.2 +3.84=695.04 mm Hg.

Wait, but that's a rough estimate. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 0.086 is 0.08 +0.006. So 640 * (0.08 +0.006) = 640*0.08 = 51.2; 640*0.006=3.84. So 51.2+3.84=55.04.

So 640 +55.04=695.04 mm Hg.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because 1.086 times 640 would be 640 + (640 *0.086). Let me compute 640 *0.086.

640 * 0.08 =51.2, 640 *0.006=3.84, so 51.2 +3.84=55.04.

So 640 +55.04=695.04 mm Hg.

Wait, but that's higher than the initial pressure. But wait, the temperature is increasing, so pressure should increase, which makes sense. So 695 mm Hg. Looking at the options, option A is 694, which is close. But let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should do the exact calculation.

So 321.15 / 296.15 = ?

Let me compute this division step by step.

296.15 ) 321.15

Compute 296.15 into 321.15:

The first digit is 1, as I said. 296.15 *1 =296.15. Subtract from 321.15: gives 25.00.

Bring down a zero: 250.00. How many times 296.15 goes into 250? Zero times. So next digit is 0.0.

Bring down another zero: 2500.00.

Now, 296.15 *8=2369.2, which is less than 2500. 296.15 *8=2369.2. So 2500 -2369.2=130.8.

So the next digit is 8. 8 *296.15=2369.2.

So after two decimal places, the division is:

1.08 

Because 296.15 fits into 321.15 once, then 0.08 times, and so on.

Wait, but let me compute 321.15 /296.15 more accurately.

Let me write it as 321.15 ÷ 296.15 = (32115 ÷ 100) / (29615 ÷ 100) ) = 32115 / 29615.

Let me compute 32115 ÷ 29615.

Well, 29615 × 1.086: Let's compute 29615 *1.086.

29615 *1 =29615.

29615 *0.08=2369.2.

29615 *0.006= 177.69.

Add them: 29615 +2369.2 =31984.2; +177.69=32161.89.

Hmm, which is a bit higher than 32115. So 29615 *1.086=32161.89.

But our numerator is 32115, which is 46.89 less than 32161.89.

So 29615 * x =32115.

x= (32115) / 29615 = (32115 ÷ 29615) = 1.086 - (46.89 ÷29615 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this as:

32115 ÷29615 = 1.086 (approximately) but maybe a little less.

So, 32115 /29615 = 1.086, but let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using calculator-like steps: 

29615 ) 32115.000

29615 goes into 32115 once, remainder 2500.

So 32115 = 29615 *1 +2500.

So 32115 /29615 = 1 + 2500 /29615.

Compute 2500 /29615 ≈0.0844.

So 1.0844. So the ratio is approximately 1.0844.

So, P2 = 640 mm Hg * 1.0844 ≈ 640 *1.0844.

Compute 640 *1 =640; 640 *0.08=51.2; 640 *0.0044=2.816.

So 640 +51.2=691.2; plus 2.816=694.016 mm Hg.

So approximately 694.02 mm Hg.

Looking at the options, option A is 694 mm Hg. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait, let me consider if the gas is ideal and the volume doesn’t change. Oh, the problem states the tank is sealed, so volume remains constant. So yes, we can apply Charles's Law.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me confirm the exact value.

Wait, another approach: using the formula P1/T1 = P2/T2.

P1 is 640 mm Hg at T1=296.15 K.

T2 is 321.15 K.

So, P2 = P1*(T2/T1) =640*(321.15/296.15).

Compute 321.15/296.15 = let me use calculator-like steps.

Alternatively, 321.15 ÷296.15: Let me approximate it as 321.15 ÷296.15 ≈ 1.086.

Wait, 296.15 * 1.086 = 319.848 + 0.086*296.15= 25.63. So 319.848+25.63=345.478? Wait, no, that can't be right because 296*1.086=321.636, but that's when multiplied by 296.15.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let me compute 321.15 ÷ 296.15.

Let me do this: both numbers are in the hundreds, so I can write them as 321.15 / 296.15 = (321.15 ÷ 10) / (296.15 ÷10) )= 32.115 /29.615.

Hmm, 29.615 *1.085 = let's compute 29.615 *1.085.

29.615 *1=29.615.

29.615 *0.08=2.3692.

29.615 *0.005=0.148075.

Adding up: 29.615 +2.3692=31.9842+0.148075=32.132275.

Which is a bit more than 32.115. So 29.615 *1.085 ≈32.132275, which is a bit higher than 32.115. So the actual value is a little less than 1.085.

So, 32.115 ÷29.615 is approximately 1.085 minus a small amount.

Let me compute the difference: 32.132275 -32.115=0.017275.

So, the difference is 0.017275. So, to find how much less than 1.085 it is, perhaps about 0.000585 (since 0.017275 /29.615 ≈0.000582).

So, 1.085 - 0.000582 ≈1.0844.

So, 32.115/29.615≈1.0844.

Thus, the ratio P2/P1 =1.0844.

So, P2=640 *1.0844= ?

640 *1 =640.

640 *0.08=51.2.

640 *0.0044= 2.816.

So 640 +51.2=691.2; +2.816=694.016 mm Hg.

So about 694.02 mm Hg, which rounds to 694 mm Hg.

Looking at the options, option A is 694 mm Hg.

So the correct answer is option A.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use **Charles's Law**, which states that for a gas at constant pressure, the pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. The law is expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

where:
- \(P_1 = 640 \, \text{mm Hg}\) (initial pressure),
- \(T_1 = 23^\circ \text{C} = 296.15 \, \text{K}\) (initial temperature),
- \(T_2 = 48^\circ \text{C} = 321.15 \, \text{K}\) (final temperature),
- \(P_2\) is the final pressure to be determined.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(P_2\):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_2 = 640 \cdot \frac{321.15}{296.15}
\]

First, calculate the ratio \(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\):

\[
\frac{321.15}{296.15} \approx 1.086
\]

Now, multiply this ratio by the initial pressure:

\[
P_2 = 640 \cdot 1.086 \approx 694.02 \, \text{mm Hg}
\]

Thus, the final pressure is approximately \(694 \, \text{mm Hg}\). Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is **Option A: 694 mm Hg**.
