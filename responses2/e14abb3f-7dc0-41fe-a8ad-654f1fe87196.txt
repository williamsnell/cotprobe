Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Johansen's trace test for cointegrating vectors. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a Johansen test is applied to a system with 4 variables. The null hypothesis here is that there are 2 cointegrating vectors. I remember that the trace test is used to determine the number of cointegrating relationships in a vector autoregressive (VAR) model.

Johansen's test works by looking at the eigenvalues of the companion matrix. The eigenvalues are important because they determine the number of cointegrating vectors. If the eigenvalues are negative, that indicates cointegration.

In the case of a system with n variables, the maximum number of cointegrating vectors is n-1, I think. So for 4 variables, the maximum is 3. But the null hypothesis here is 2 vectors, so the alternative is that there are more than 2. 

The trace test involves computing the eigenvalues and then comparing them to certain cutoff values. The test involves looking at the cumulative sum (S) statistic, which is the sum of the largest eigenvalues (excluding the unit root eigenvalue, which is usually 1) that are less than zero. The test is applied in steps, starting from the trace statistic, then the maximum eigenvalue statistic, etc.

Wait, the test for cointegration involves looking at how many eigenvalues are less than zero. So for a system with 4 variables, the number of cointegrating vectors is determined by the number of eigenvalues that are negative. The test is a sequential test where you start with the highest number of cointegrating vectors possible and work down.

The critical values for the trace test depend on the number of variables. For a system with m variables, the number of possible cointegrating vectors is min(k, m-1), where k is the number of cointegrating vectors under the alternative hypothesis. But in this case, the null is k=2, and m=4, so maximum possible is 3, but the alternative could be higher.

The trace test for the rank of cointegration vectors (rank r) is done by computing the number of eigenvalues that are less than zero. The test compares the trace statistic with critical values at different rank levels.

So, for the null hypothesis that r=2, the alternative could be r>2, but since the maximum possible is 3, perhaps the test is done for r=1, 2, or 3. But the question is about applying the test when the null is r=2. So when we conduct the trace test, we're considering the largest eigenvalues.

The trace statistic is the sum of the largest r eigenvalues. Wait, actually, for the rank r, the critical values are based on the sum of the largest eigenvalues. So when the null is r=2, you have to compute the sum of the largest two eigenvalues (excluding the unit root) and see if it's above the critical value.

But wait, the critical values are derived from the maximum rank assumption. So for the test, if the null is r=2, the alternative could be higher, but the test is about the number of cointegrating vectors.

So the test would look at all eigenvalues, up to the number of variables minus one. Wait, no, the companion matrix for a system with m variables has eigenvalues, and the number of cointegrating vectors is equal to the number of eigenvalues that are negative. The trace test counts the number of eigenvalues that are less than zero, starting from the largest.

But in the case of a rank r, the number of eigenvalues less than zero is r. So for a rank 2, two eigenvalues are negative. The trace statistic is the sum of the first 2 eigenvalues (if the matrix is sorted in descending order). So when testing the null of rank 2, you include the two largest eigenvalues.

Wait, but the trace test for cointegration typically involves looking at the largest eigenvalues. The test is a stepwise process where each step tests the null that the rank is at most r. So for example, you test for rank 1, then rank 2, etc.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvalues used in the test. The test is comparing the sum of the largest eigenvalues against the critical values. So for rank 2, you take the two largest eigenvalues. Because the test is about the number of cointegrating vectors, the number of eigenvalues that are negative is the rank.

Therefore, to determine the number of cointegrating vectors, you would look at the eigenvalues. The number of eigenvalues that are negative (and less than zero) tells you the rank. The test would involve the largest eigenvalues because they contribute more to the test statistic.

So, for the test, when the null is 2, you would use the largest two eigenvalues. The sum of these two would be the trace statistic. If it's above the critical value, you reject the null, suggesting more than 2 cointegrating vectors exist.

Looking at the options, option E says the largest and second largest. That would be the two largest eigenvalues. So option E would be the correct choice.

To determine the eigenvalues used in the Johansen trace test for a null hypothesis of 2 cointegrating vectors in a system with 4 variables, we must consider the number of eigenvalues that are negative and less than zero. The trace test compares the sum of the largest eigenvalues to critical values to determine the number of cointegrating vectors.

- **Option A (Largest and smallest):** Incorrect. The smallest eigenvalues are irrelevant for testing cointegration, as they do not contribute to the number of cointegrating vectors.
- **Option B (Smallest and second smallest):** Incorrect. These are not considered in the trace test for cointegration.
- **Option C (Middle two):** Incorrect. The middle eigenvalues do not represent the cointegrating relationships.
- **Option D (Smallest 2):** Incorrect. Only the smallest eigenvalues are not relevant for testing cointegration.
- **Option E (Largest and second largest):** Correct. The trace test uses the largest eigenvalues to assess the number of cointegrating vectors. Specifically, the sum of the two largest eigenvalues (excluding the unit root eigenvalue) is computed.
- **Option F (Third and fourth largest):** Incorrect. These are not considered in the trace test for rank determination.
- **Option G (Second smallest):** Incorrect. This refers to a single eigenvalue and does not apply to the test for two cointegrating vectors.
- **Option H (Second smallest and second largest):** Incorrect. The second smallest eigenvalue is not used in the trace test for cointegration.
- **Option I (All of them):** Incorrect. The test only considers specific eigenvalues (the largest) for assessing the number of cointegrating vectors.
- **Option J (Largest and second largest):** Correct. This aligns with the test procedure for determining the number of cointegrating vectors.

The correct answer is **E: The largest and second largest**.
