Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me. The question is asking me to find the value of the expression 14 plus (-71). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

Alright, adding a positive and a negative number. Right, when you add a negative number, it's like subtracting the absolute value of that number. So 14 plus (-71) is the same as 14 minus 71. Let me write that down: 14 - 71.

Wait, what's 14 minus 71? Well, 71 is bigger than 14, so the result will be negative. Let's calculate the difference. 71 minus 14 is 57. So 14 minus 71 is -57. So the value of the expression is -57.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. Option F is -57. So the correct answer should be F.
