Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this psychology multiple-choice question about the three basic goals. Let me start by recalling what I know about psychology's main objectives.

I remember that psychology is all about understanding human behavior and mental processes. There are three main goals I think are standard in psychology education. 

First, I think about the goal of learning. People in psychology often talk about teaching people to learn and understand things. That makes sense because learning is fundamental to understanding how people think and behave.

Second, I remember that studying human behavior is also a key goal. Psychologists want to understand how people think, feel, and behave. This helps in predicting and explaining behavior, which is crucial for various applications in education and policy-making.

Third, there's the goal of explaining and understanding human behavior. This probably includes both the social and psychological aspects. It helps in creating models and theories that can be applied to real-life situations.

Looking at the options, option G mentions studying the human mind, understanding human emotions, and promoting mental health. That aligns with what I was thinking about. It's about understanding the mind, emotions, and how to improve mental well-being.

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option A talks about educational systems, global crises, and animal behavior. That doesn't sound right because those are more about education and behavior, not the three main goals.

Option B is about spirituality, creativity, and wealth. That's more about personal interests and economic aspects, not the psychological goals.

Option C repeats the same statement again, which is redundant but correct.

Option D is about cognitive performance, understanding celestial stuff, and new technologies. Doesn't fit the psychological focus.

Option E is about economics, art, and exploration. Doesn't touch on the psychological core goals.

Option F is AI, genome, and tech. That's more about technology and science, not the educational or behavioral goals.

Option G seems to cover all three main goals: studying the mind, understanding emotions, and promoting mental health. So that's the right answer.

Option I talks about human development, social interactions, and promoting positive behavior. That's a good point, but it's less about the fundamental goals than more about specific areas within psychology.

Option J is about medication, conformity, and explaining events. That's more about clinical applications rather than the theoretical goals.

So, the correct answer must be G. It clearly states the three basic goals: studying the human mind, understanding human emotions, and promoting mental health. That's exactly what I learned in psychology.

The correct answer is G: "To study the human mind, to understand human emotions, and to promote mental health." This option accurately reflects the three fundamental goals of psychology.

Answer: G
