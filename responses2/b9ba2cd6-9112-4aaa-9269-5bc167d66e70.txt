Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers."
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a speech by Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanian leader. The speech talks about creating a political union to avoid all the dangers of disunity. The speech also mentions that the French saw Africa as having certain characteristics.

Looking at the options, let me think what each one means. The key part is that the French saw Africa in a certain way. From the speech, I remember that Kwame Nkrumah emphasized the need for African unity and political union, which serves as an example. He also mentions that the French should respect the continent's political unity rather than just size and influence. So, the French probably saw Africa as needing union to maintain peace.

Let me look at the options again. Option C says "An example of successful political union." That seems right because the speech highlights how African unity is seen as effective. Option A talks about Africa needing French intervention, which isn't what the speech says. The French should support African unity, not necessarily rely on them.

Option E is about the Sahara's atomic tests. The speech says the French should avoid these tests, so the French saw Africa as a threat. Option H is a threat to power, which might not be the right interpretation. Option B is about natural resources, which doesn't seem to fit the speech.

Option F is a strong political union, which is similar to C but not as specific. Option G is a threat, which is not correct. Option I is about republics getting into anarchy, which doesn't match the speech's emphasis on unity as an example.

So, putting it all together, the French saw Africa as needing a political union to maintain peace. So the correct answer should be option C.
