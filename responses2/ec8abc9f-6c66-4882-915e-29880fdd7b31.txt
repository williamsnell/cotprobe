Okay, so I've got this problem here about distributing 13 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes. The catch is that no box can be left empty. Hmm, I remember this is a combinatorics problem, probably something to do with combinations or permutations. 

Let me think. When dealing with identical items and distinct boxes, it's usually the stars and bars method. Oh right, stars and bars is a common technique. The formula I recall is C(n + k - 1, k - 1), where n is the number of items and k is the number of boxes. But wait, that gives the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k distinct boxes where boxes can be empty. 

But in this case, the boxes can't be empty. So I need to adjust the formula. Oh, right, the formula for distributing n identical items into k distinct boxes with no empty boxes is C(n - 1, k - 1). So in this problem, n is 13 and k is 4. 

Let me calculate that. So n =13, k=4. So 13-1 is 12, and 4-1 is 3. So it's C(12,3). What's C(12,3)? 

The combination formula is n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So 12!/(3!9!) = (12×11×10)/(3×2×1) = (1320)/(6) = 220. 

So the number of ways is 220. Looking at the options, option B is 220. So the answer should be B.

The number of ways to distribute 13 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes with no box empty is calculated using the formula for combinations with no empty boxes: C(n-1, k-1), where n=13 and k=4. This gives C(12,3) = 220.
