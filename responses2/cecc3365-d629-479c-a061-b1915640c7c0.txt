Fearing that the girl would beat out her daughter for the last cheerleading position, the mother decided to kill the girl. One night while the mother and her boyfriend were having dinner, the mother asked him to kill the girl. The mother handed her boyfriend a gun and gave him the home address where the girl lived. Unknown to the boyfriend, the mother gave him the wrong address. By mistake, the boyfriend went to the home of a family who lived across the street from the girl. The boyfriend rang the doorbell and a woman opened the door. The boyfriend asked the woman if her daughter was home. The woman called for her daughter to come to the front door. When she did so, the boyfriend shot and killed both the woman and her daughter. The mother should be found guilty for which, if any, of the following crimes?

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it again carefully.

The scenario is about a mother who hated her daughter and she outperformed, so she feared her daughter would get the last cheerleading position. She wanted to kill her daughter, so she and her boyfriend went to dinner. The mother handed her boyfriend a gun, and gave him the address where the girl lived. But there's a mistake: she gave him the wrong address, leading him to the family across the street instead of where the girl was. The boyfriend then rang the doorbell, and a woman opened it. That woman asked if her daughter was there. The woman called for her daughter to come. Once she did, the boyfriend shot and killed both the woman and her daughter.

The question is asking which crimes the mother is guilty of, if any. The options are A through J, each combining different crimes. I need to determine her liability.

First, I'll break down the law here. There's a few key elements: murder, attempted murder, and possible conspiracy or voluntary manslaughter.

The mother is using her authority to kill the girl, but the circumstances—I should think about the elements for each crime.

For attempted murder, the elements are: (1) the act of committing the crime (killing), (2) the act was a deliberate attempt to commit a felony, and (3) the attempt was made with the intent to cause serious bodily injury or death.

In this case, the mother intended to kill her daughter. She had the gun, and she had the address. She gave the wrong address, so the boyfriend thought he was correct but went to the wrong place. The mother didn't have the right address, so she didn't know the girl was there. But just because she thought she was correct doesn't mean she intended to kill the girl.

Wait, but she gave the gun and the wrong address. That might be a conspiracy element. Because the mother gave the gun to her boyfriend but then gave a wrong address, possibly to prevent the boyfriend from being the one who would kill her. But wait, how much of that is considered conspiracy?

Conspiracy usually involves a concerted act by a group, with the intent to commit a crime, and the act was done with the intent to cause serious bodily harm or death. But in this case, the mother didn't give the gun to the boyfriend to kill. She gave it to him, but the boyfriend thought he was correct. So the mother had the gun and the wrong address. That might constitute a conspiracy because she had the wrong address, giving him the chance to kill her. So the mother's giving the wrong address is part of a scheme to kill.

But does that count as a conspiracy? Because she gave the gun to the boyfriend, knowing that the wrong address would lead him to the wrong place. So she had the information (the wrong address) to make the boyfriend target her. So perhaps she's guilty of conspiracy.

Now, for the murder charges. She intended to kill her daughter. But the mother didn't intend to kill her daughter directly. She intended to kill the girl, but the girl was at home where she was supposed to be. But the mother didn't know where the girl was; she thought she was in the same place as her daughter. So she didn't commit the murder herself. That would make her an attempter.

So, the mother intended to kill the girl, but the girl wasn't dead when she acted. So her intent was to kill someone else—so she's an attempter. But she didn't intend to kill herself. So she's an attempter, not a murder charge.

So, she's guilty of attempted murder, but she's not guilty of murder because she didn't intend to kill herself. But wait, wait, no. Wait. Let me think again. She intended to kill the girl, but she knew she was wrong about the address. So she didn't intend to kill herself. So she's an attempter, not a murder.

Wait, no. Wait. She intended to kill the girl, but she didn't know where she was. So she intended to kill the wrong person, but she didn't intend to kill herself. So she's an attempter. So she's guilty of attempted murder.

But wait, another angle: she gave the gun to the boyfriend, knowing he was going to the wrong place. So perhaps she's guilty of conspiracy because she knew the wrong place and gave the gun to the boyfriend. So she may have a conspiracy to kill.

So, putting it together: She's guilty of conspiracy (because she knew the wrong address and gave the gun to the boyfriend, leading him to the wrong place), and she's guilty of attempted murder because she intended to kill the girl, but didn't intend to kill herself.

Wait, but could she be guilty of two murder counts? Let's think. She intended to kill the girl, but that's the only person she intended to kill. The girl was at home, but the mother didn't know where she was. So she intended to kill the girl, but she didn't intend to kill herself. So she's guilty of attempted murder, not murder.

Wait, but what about the possibility of her killing her own daughter? The mother intended to kill her daughter and make her feel inferior, so she feared the daughter would get the last spot. She might have just killed her own daughter. But in this case, she's killed the woman (the woman who was the daughter) and her daughter. So, she's both killing the woman and the daughter.

So, the killing of the woman is an attempter, and the killing of the daughter is a murder attempt. So she's guilty of both attempted murder (for killing the woman) and murder (for killing the daughter).

Wait, but did she intend to kill herself? No, she intended to kill the girl, but the girl was elsewhere. So she intended to kill the wrong person. So she's guilty of attempted murder for killing the woman, and for the daughter, she's guilty of murder. So she's guilty of an attempted murder and a murder charge.

Wait, but wait. The mother intended to kill the girl, but she was going to the wrong place. So she intended to kill the wrong girl. So, she's guilty of conspiracy to kill the wrong person (conspiracy) and she's guilty of attempted murder for killing the woman (attempted, because she intended to kill someone else) and for the daughter, she's guilty of murder.

Wait, but what about the counts. So, the mother is guilty of conspiracy (she intended to kill the wrong person), and attempted murder (she intended to kill the woman) and murder (she intended to kill the daughter). So that would be three counts: conspiracy, attempted murder, and murder.

Wait, but another angle: can she be guilty of murder for killing her own daughter? Because she intended to kill her daughter. So, she intended to kill her own daughter, but that's not herself. So, she's guilty of attempted murder for killing the woman, and she's guilty of murder for killing her daughter (but she doesn't intend to kill herself; she intended to kill the girl, but that's a different person). So, that would be two murder charges: one for the woman (attempted) and one for the daughter (murder). So, the mother is guilty of conspiracy (she intended to kill the wrong person), attempted murder (for the woman), and murder (for the daughter). That's three counts.

Looking at the options:

Option C says conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. So that would be C: conspiracy, attempted murder, and two Murder charges.

Option D says conspiracy and two Murder charges. So D says she's guilty of conspiracy and two Murder counts.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. She intended to kill the girl, but the girl wasn't dead when she acted. So she intended to kill the wrong girl. So she's guilty of conspiracy (intending to kill the wrong person) and she's guilty of attempted murder (intending to kill the woman) and she's guilty of murder (intending to kill the daughter). So that's three counts: conspiracy, attempted murder, and two Murder charges.

Wait, no. Oh wait, no. Wait. Let me think again. She intended to kill the girl, but she knew she was wrong about the address. So she didn't intend to kill herself. So she's guilty of attempted murder for killing the woman, and she's guilty of murder for killing the daughter (which is a different person). So she's guilty of two Murder charges. Plus, she's guilty of conspiracy for the wrong target.

So, the counts would be: conspiracy (to kill the wrong person), attempted murder (for killing the woman), and two Murder charges (for killing the daughter). So that's three counts: conspiracy, attempted murder, and two Murder counts. So option C says conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. That would fit.

But wait, another point: when she intended to kill the girl, but she didn't intend to kill herself. So she's guilty of attempted murder for the wrong girl, and she's guilty of murder for the right girl. So that's two murder charges. So, the options are about whether she's guilty of those.

So the options are:

A: Consonance and voluntary manslaughter. No, because she's not a murder charge, and she's not a voluntary manslaughter.

B: Solicitation, attempted murder, and one count of murder. No, because she's not a solicitation.

C: Consonance, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. That fits.

D: Consonance and two counts of murder. No, because there's an attempted murder charge.

E: Solicitation and attempted murder. No, she didn't do anything Solicitive.

So the correct answer is C: conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

The scenario describes how the mother's actions could be held responsible for certain crimes. Here's the analysis:

1. **Conspiracy**: The mother intended to kill the wrong person (the woman) by giving a wrong address. This constitutes a concerted act with the intent to cause serious bodily harm or death, making her guilty of conspiracy.

2. **Attempted Murder**: The mother intended to kill the woman but was unaware that she was the correct target. This is an attempt to kill someone else, qualifying as an attempt to kill. She did not intend to kill herself, so she is not guilty of murder for herself.

3. **Murder**: The mother intended to kill the daughter, which is a different individual. This constitutes murder, as she intended to cause serious bodily harm or death.

4. **Counts of Murder**: She is guilty of two counts of murder: one for the woman (attempted murder) and one for the daughter (murder).

5. **Other Options**: The other options either omit the correct number of counts or do not align with the facts. For example, option B includes only one murder count, and option D excludes attempted murder.

Based on this analysis, the mother is guilty of conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

**ANSWER: C**
