Okay, so I have this polynomial problem in front of me. Let me read it again. It says: The polynomial which results from the expansion of (x² + 5x + 6)² + (px + q)(x³ + 7x² + 3x) has degree 2. I need to find p + q. The options are given from A to J. Hmm, I should probably start by expanding the given expression and then see what conditions make the degree 2.

First, let me write down the expression: (x² + 5x + 6)² plus (px + q)(x³ + 7x² + 3x). I need to make sure that after expanding this, the highest power of x is 2. So, the degree of the resulting polynomial must be 2. That means all the terms with x³ and higher must cancel out or have coefficients zero.

Let me start by expanding each part step by step.

First, the square of (x² + 5x + 6). I'll expand that. (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So applying that:

(x²)² = x⁴,
(5x)² = 25x²,
(6)² = 36,
2*(x²)*(5x) = 10x³,
2*(x²)*6 = 12x²,
2*(5x)*6 = 60x.

So adding all those together:
x⁴ + 10x³ + (25x² + 12x²) + 60x + 36
Simplify:
x⁴ + 10x³ + 37x² + 60x + 36.

Alright, so the first part expands to x⁴ +10x³ +37x² +60x +36.

Now, onto the second part: (px + q)(x³ +7x² +3x). Let me expand that.

Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second:
px * x³ = px⁴,
px *7x² =7p x³,
px *3x =3p x²,
q *x³ = q x³,
q *7x² =7q x²,
q *3x =3q x.

So adding all those terms together:
px⁴ + (7p x³ + q x³) + (3p x² +7q x²) +3q x.

Combine like terms:
px⁴ + (7p + q) x³ + (3p +7q) x² +3q x.

So the second part simplifies to px⁴ + (7p + q)x³ + (3p +7q)x² +3q x.

Now, the entire expression is the sum of the first part and the second part. Let me add them together.

First part: x⁴ +10x³ +37x² +60x +36.

Second part: px⁴ + (7p + q)x³ + (3p +7q)x² +3q x.

So adding:

x⁴ + px⁴ = (1 + p)x⁴,
10x³ + (7p + q)x³ = (10 +7p + q)x³,
37x² + (3p +7q)x² = (37 +3p +7q)x²,
60x +3q x = (60 +3q)x,
36 remains as is.

So the entire polynomial is:

(1 + p)x⁴ + (10 +7p + q)x³ + (37 +3p +7q)x² + (60 +3q)x +36.

But the problem states that the resulting polynomial has degree 2. Degree is the highest power of x with a non-zero coefficient. So, all the coefficients of x³, x⁴, x must be zero. That means:

1. Coefficient of x⁴: 1 + p = 0.
2. Coefficient of x³: 10 +7p + q = 0.
3. Coefficient of x²: 37 +3p +7q = 0. (This is given that the degree is 2, so this term must be zero as well.)

Wait, but wait. Since the degree is 2, the x³ term and x⁴ term must both be zero. So:

From 1: 1 + p = 0 => p = -1.

Now, plug p = -1 into equation 2:

10 +7*(-1) + q = 0 => 10 -7 + q = 0 => 3 + q = 0 => q = -3.

Then, check equation 3 to make sure it's satisfied:

37 +3*(-1) +7*(-3) = 37 -3 -21 = 13. Wait, that's 37-3=34, 34-21=13. But we need this to be zero. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, because if the polynomial must have degree 2, then the coefficients of x⁴ and x³ must be zero. So the equations should be:

1. Coefficient of x⁴ is (1 + p) = 0 → p = -1.
2. Coefficient of x³ is (10 +7p + q) = 0.

Substituting p = -1:

10 +7*(-1) + q = 10 -7 + q = 3 + q = 0 → q = -3.

Now, check the coefficient of x²: 37 +3p +7q. Substituting p = -1 and q = -3:

37 + 3*(-1) +7*(-3) = 37 -3 -21 =13. That's not zero, which would mean the x² term is 13x², making the polynomial have degree 2. But wait, the problem says the degree is 2, which requires that the x³ and x⁴ coefficients are zero, and the x² coefficient is non-zero. So that works. So if the coefficient of x² is 13, it's okay, as it's non-zero.

So with p = -1 and q = -3, let's see.

Then, p + q = (-1) + (-3) = -4. Looking at the options, G is -4. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when I expand everything, the x² coefficient is 37 +3p +7q. If p=-1 and q=-3, that gives:

37 +3*(-1) +7*(-3) → 37 -3 -21 → 13.

Which is non-zero, so the degree is 2. Correct.

So p + q = (-1) + (-3) = -4. Which is option G.
</think>

The polynomial must have degree 2, so the coefficients of x³ and x⁴ must be zero. Solving for p and q gives p = -1 and q = -3. Therefore, p + q = -4.

Answer: G

G: -4
