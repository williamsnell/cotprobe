Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, so the formula should be something like N(t) = N0 * e^(-kt), where N(t) is the quantity at time t, N0 is the initial quantity, k is the decay constant, and t is time.

The problem states that at noon, there's 50 grams of the isotope. Then, 9 days later, at noon +9, only 45 grams remain. So the time elapsed here is 9 days, and the initial quantity N0 is 50 grams.

First, I need to find the decay constant k. Using the information from noon to noon+9 days, I can set up the equation:

45 = 50 * e^(-k*9)

I can solve for k. Let me rearrange the equation. Divide both sides by 50: 

45/50 = e^(-k*9)
0.9 = e^(-9k)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(0.9) = -9k

So, k = -ln(0.9) / 9

Calculating ln(0.9): I know that ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, and ln(1) is 0. So ln(0.9) is a negative number. Let me compute it approximately. I think ln(0.9) is about -0.10536. So:

k ≈ 0.10536 / 9 ≈ 0.011707 days^-1

Now, the question is asking how many days after the experiment started there will be only 20 grams left. So, we need to find the time t when N(t) = 20 grams.

Using the same formula:

20 = 50 * e^(-kt)

Divide both sides by 50:

0.4 = e^(-kt)

Take the natural log again:

ln(0.4) = -kt

So, t = -ln(0.4) / k

We know k is approximately 0.011707, so let's plug that in.

First, compute ln(0.4). I remember that ln(0.4) is approximately -0.91629. So:

t = 0.91629 / 0.011707 ≈ 78.5 days.

Hmm, so approximately 78.5 days. But the options are in whole numbers. The closest options are C:70 and G:78. Wait, 78.5 is closer to 78, so option G:78. But let me double-check my calculations because that's the approximate approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute ln(0.9) and ln(0.4) precisely.

ln(0.9): Let me calculate it more accurately. I know that ln(0.9) is approximately -0.105360516.

So, k = 0.105360516 /9 = 0.011706724...

Now, ln(0.4) = -0.916291209.

So t = (-0.916291209) / (-0.011706724) = 0.916291209 / 0.011706724 ≈ 78.54 days.

So approximately 78.54 days. The options are 70, 75, 78, etc. So 78 is the closest, so option G:78.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options don't have 78.54, but the closest is 78, which is option G. So the answer should be G:78.

To determine when the isotope will reduce to 20 grams, we use the exponential decay formula. The decay constant \( k \) is found using the data from noon to noon + 9 days:

\[
45 = 50 \cdot e^{-9k} \implies k = \frac{-\ln(0.9)}{9} \approx 0.011707 \, \text{days}^{-1}.
\]

Using this \( k \) to find the time \( t \) when \( N(t) = 20 \, \text{g} \):

\[
20 = 50 \cdot e^{-0.011707t} \implies t = \frac{-\ln(0.4)}{0.011707} \approx 78.54 \, \text{days}.
\]

The closest option is \( 78 \) days, so the answer is **G: 78**.
