Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically about attempted murder. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question describes a scenario where a defendant was driving recklessly over the speed limit in a residential area. He lost control of his car and jumped a curb, causing a woman to be struck. The woman was injured, especially with severe internal injuries, and she was hospitalized for 11 months, becoming permanently disabled. The defendant is charged with attempted murder, and we need to decide whether he's guilty or not based on the options provided.

I remember that attempted murder involves the standard of intent, which requires that the defendant acted towards a specific purpose with reckless disregard for the possibility of death. So, the key here is whether the defendant acted in a way that was towards the woman with reckless disregard for her life.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not guilty because the woman should have avoided the car. That makes sense because if she had avoided the car, the defendant would have been less likely to have done this recklessly. But does this directly address the intent aspect? I think it's more about intent than the actions themselves.

Option B: Not guilty because he lost control of the vehicle. Thatâ€™s not quite right. The intent isn't about the act of losing control; it's about whether he intended to kill. He didn't intend to kill her, so this option seems too absolute.

Option C: Guilty because criminal liability is predicated on willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others. This sounds more accurate. The defendant's reckless disregard for the woman's safety would mean he intended to cause harm with reckless intent, which fits the intent standard.

Option D: Not guilty because he didn't specifically target the woman. Well, the intent standard requires intent towards the specific person. If he had, say, a specific intent to kill, that would fit. But if he didn't target her, his intent is unclear. So this option doesn't cover the intent aspect.

Option E: Guilty because he was driving over the speed limit. The speed limit is a factor, but the question is about intent, not whether he was speeding. Unless speeding was a factor in the recklessness, which it could be, but the options don't mention speeding as a factor, so this might not be the right choice.

Option F: Not guilty because he didn't intend to kill. The intent standard requires that he intended to kill. He didn't intend to kill, so F is a no-go.

Option G: Not guilty because he had no control over the car. Hmm, no, he did control the car because he was driving over the speed limit. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Guilty because he's driving over the speed limit. Again, unless speeding is a factor in intent, this alone might not be enough. But I think the intent is more about the disregard for the woman's life, not the speed limit.

Option I: Guilty because he intended the natural consequences. But natural consequences usually refer to the result of his actions, not the intent. It's more about the consequences after he acts. So I think this is wrong.

Option J: Guilty because he was aware of the consequences. Wait, the standard for attempted murder is that the defendant knew about the consequences. So, if he was aware, he could have justified his actions. But I'm not sure if the intent or the awareness is sufficient on its own. The main factor is the intent towards the specific person.

Wait, but the question is about the charge being found guilty. So, the options are about whether the defendant should be found guilty or not.

So, putting it together:

The question is about whether the defendant is guilty based on his actions. The elements of attempted murder require intent towards the specific person (the woman) with reckless disregard for her life.

Looking at the options, the correct reasoning would align with option C, which says he was driving recklessly, so he's guilty because his reckless disregard for the woman's safety leads him to be found guilty.

Alternatively, another point: the defendant was driving over the speed limit, but that's a factor in the recklessness, but the question doesn't directly address that. The key is whether his reckless disregard for the woman's safety is sufficient.

So, the correct answer should be option C.

The question revolves around whether the defendant is guilty of attempted murder based on his reckless driving and the woman's injuries. The correct analysis hinges on the standard of intent required for attempted murder, which demands that the defendant acted towards a specific purpose with reckless disregard for the possibility of death.

Option C, which states that the defendant's reckless disregard for the woman's safety leads to guilt, aligns with this standard. The defendant's actions were towards a specific person, with reckless disregard for her life, satisfying the intent requirement. Other options either misrepresent the elements of attempted murder or fail to address the disregard for the woman's safety.
