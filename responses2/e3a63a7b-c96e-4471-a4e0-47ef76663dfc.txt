Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the nth roots of unity. I remember that the nth roots of unity are complex numbers that, when raised to the nth power, equal 1. So, they form a group under multiplication, right?

Wait, what's a group again? Oh right, a group is a set with an operation that satisfies closure, associativity, has an identity element, and every element has an inverse. And the set is abelian if the operation is commutative.

So, the nth roots of unity. Let's think. For example, the 3rd roots are 1, ω, ω², where ω is a primitive 3rd root. Multiplying them together, their product is 1. Each non-1 root has an inverse in the set, and the identity is 1. So, it's a group.

But is it abelian? Because if we multiply any two roots, say ω * ω², that gives 1, since ω³=1. Wait, but for higher roots, like 4th roots, the multiplication isn't commutative. Oh wait, no, in the case of roots of unity, multiplication is commutative. Because complex numbers multiply in a way that's commutative. So, for any two nth roots of unity, their product is the same as multiplying in any order. So, yes, it's abelian.

Wait, but let me think. The group operation is multiplication, and for nth roots, the group is abelian because the cyclic group structure makes it so. So the nth roots of unity under multiplication form an abelian group. So the correct option would be E, which is abelian group.

What about other options? Let's see. Option A: non-abelian group. No, since the group is abelian. Option B: infinite group. No, finite, since there are only n elements. Option C: commutative semigroup with identity. Hmm, a semigroup is a set with associative operation. Since it's abelian, it's commutative. So yes, it's a commutative semigroup with identity. But the question is about the set being a group. So option C is correct in structure but the question is about it being a group, which it is, but the question is phrased as "the set... form a/an" so the answer is about the type of group. So the options are about what kind of group it is.

Wait, looking back, the question says, "the set... form a/an". So it's asking what kind of group it is. So the group must be abelian. So option E is correct.

What about option G: semi group with identity. Well, it's a group, which is a more specific structure. So G is not the correct answer. Also, the group is abelian, so E is correct.

So the correct answer is E.

The set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers forms a group. Specifically, it is an abelian group because the operation of multiplication is commutative. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Answer: E
