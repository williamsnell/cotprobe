Alright, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The question says that the point (3,6) is on the graph of y = g(x). So that means when x is 3, g(x) is 6. Got it. Then h(x) is defined as (g(x)) squared for all x. So h(x) is just taking the output of g(x) and squaring it. The question is asking, if I have a point on h(x), what one must be on h(x). And then it wants the sum of the coordinates of that point. The options are A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what point (a, b) must lie on h(x) if (3,6) is on g(x). Since h(x) is the square of g(x), I should think about how squaring affects the points on the graph.

Let me think step by step.

First, since (3,6) is on y = g(x), that means when x = 3, g(3) = 6. Then, h(3) would be (g(3))², which is 6² = 36. So the point (3, 36) must be on h(x). Wait, but the options don't have 36 as a coordinate. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is 9, B is 27, C is 39, D is 36, E is 45, F is 18, G is 13, H is 15, I is 21, J is 12.

So 36 is option D. So the point (3,36) must be on h(x). Wait, but the question is asking for the sum of the coordinates of that point. So 3 + 36 is 39. Is that correct? Wait no, because 3 + 36 is 39, but wait, 3 + 36 is 39, but hold on. The point is (3,36), so the coordinates are 3 and 36. Adding them gives 39. But is that the only point?

Wait, no, because h(x) is (g(x))². So for any x, h(x) is the square of g(x). But the given point is (3,6) on g(x). So h(3) = 36, so (3,36) is on h(x). But is there another point that must be on h(x)? Let me think.

Wait, the question says, "there is one point that must be on the graph of y = h(x)." So perhaps there's another approach. Maybe if there's another x where h(x) would give a known value. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought. Since h(x) is the square of g(x), perhaps any point on g(x) will have a corresponding point on h(x) that is the square. But the problem says that (3,6) is on g(x), so h(3) is 36. So (3,36) is on h(x). So the sum is 3 + 36 = 39, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other points. So h(x) = [g(x)]², so for every x, h(x) is (g(x))². Since g(3) is 6, h(3) is 6² = 36. So (3,36) is definitely on h(x).

Is there any other point that must be on h(x)? I don't think so because the question specifies that (3,6) is on g(x), so h(x) is defined for all x. So the only point we can be certain about is (3,36). Therefore, the sum is 3 + 36 = 39, which is option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A:9, B:27, C:39, D:36, E:45, F:18, G:13, H:15, I:21, J:12.

Yes, 39 is option C. So the answer should be C:39.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because 3 + 36 is 39, correct. So the sum is 39, which is option C. So I think that's the correct answer.

The point (3,6) on g(x) implies h(3) = (g(3))² = 36. Thus, (3,36) is on h(x), and the sum of its coordinates is 3 + 36 = 39, which is option C.

**Answer:** C
