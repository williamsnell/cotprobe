Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that the atomic weight of element X is 58.7. Then, 7.34 grams of X displaces 0.25 grams of hydrogen from hydrochloric acid (HCl). The question is asking for the valence of element X, and there are options from A to J, including various positive and negative valences.

Hmm, right. So I think this is about stoichiometry and the displacement reaction. When a metal displaces hydrogen from HCl, it's a redox reaction, right? The metal (X) is being oxidized, and the H+ ions are reduced to H2.

I remember that the general reaction for such a displacement is:
M + 2H+ → M^2+ + H2↑

Wait, but wait. The valence of M here is +2 because it's going from M^0 (metal) to M^2+ (metal ion). So the valence is +2. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that 7.34g of X displaces 0.25g of H. So the reaction is M + HCl → MCl + H2. So for every mole of M, one mole of H is displaced.

Let me think about the moles involved. The molar mass of X is 58.7 g/mol. So the moles of X would be mass divided by molar mass. Let's calculate that.

Moles X = 7.34g / 58.7g/mol. Let me do the division: 7.34 divided by 58.7. Let me compute that. 58.7 times 0.127 is about 7.34, so approximately 0.127 moles.

Now, the amount of H displaced is 0.25g. The molar mass of H is about 1g/mol, so moles of H = 0.25g / 1g/mol = 0.25 moles.

In the reaction, each mole of X displaces one mole of H. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

So if the moles displaced are 0.25, then the moles of X should also be 0.25, right? Wait, but earlier I calculated moles of X as 0.127. That seems conflicting. What's the issue here?

Ah, wait a second. Because the problem says that 7.34g of X displaces 0.25g of H. So the moles of X would be less than the moles of H displaced? Because the reaction only displaces one H per mole of X.

Wait, no. Let's think about it another way. Suppose the reaction is X + HCl → XCl + H2. For every mole of X, you get one mole of H2 released. So moles X = moles H2.

But the mass of X is 7.34g, which is less than the mass of H2. Because H2 is about 2g/mol. Let's compute the mass of H2 produced.

Moles H2 = moles X = 0.127 mol. So mass H2 = 0.127 * 2 = 0.254g. But in the problem, it's 0.25g. Hmm. That's a discrepancy. So maybe the reaction is not 1:1, or perhaps the stoichiometry is different.

Wait, maybe the stoichiometry isn't 1:1. Because in reality, the reaction might be something like:

X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2

In this case, each mole of X would produce one mole of H2, but X would have a valence of +4. Let's see.

So the mass of X would be 7.34g, which is the same as the mass of XCl2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the molar masses. Suppose X has a valence of +2, then XCl2 would have a molar mass of (atomic weight + 2*35.5). But wait, let's approach it more methodically.

Let me consider the reaction again. Let's say the equation is:

a X + b HCl → c XCl_d + e H2

But perhaps a simpler approach is to think in terms of moles.

The moles of X is n = 7.34 / 58.7 ≈ 0.127 mol.

The moles of H displaced is 0.25g H / 1g/mol = 0.25 mol.

So, moles of X = 0.127, but moles of H displaced is 0.25. So for each mole of X, 2 H are displaced. So the reaction must be 1 mole X → 2 moles H.

Wait, but no, because the reaction is X + HCl → XCl + H2. So for every mole of X, you get one mole of H2. So the moles ratio is 1:1.

But in the problem, the moles of X is 0.127, but moles of H2 is 0.25. So that suggests that the ratio is 0.127 X to 0.25 H2, which is 0.127 :0.25 => 1: ~2. So that's a 1:2 ratio. Wait, no, because 0.25 /0.127 ≈ 1.97, so approx 2. Hmm. So the ratio is about 1:2.

So that would mean that the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2.

Because then, 1 mole X produces 1 mole H2. So the moles of X is 0.127, which would mean moles of H2 is 0.127. But the problem says 0.25g H2, which is 0.25/2=0.125 mol. But according to the calculation, the moles of H2 should be 0.127, but in the problem it's 0.125. Hmm, perhaps that's close enough, considering rounding errors.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the reaction ratio. Let me think again. So if the moles of X is 0.127, and it produces 0.25g H2, which is 0.25/2 = 0.125 mol H2. So 0.127 moles X produces 0.125 mol H2. The ratio is about 1:0.95, which is roughly 1:1. So maybe the reaction is 1 mole X : 1 mole H2.

So the reaction is X + HCl → XCl + H2, and the stoichiometry is 1:1.

So the valence of X is +2.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the molar masses.

Assuming X is, say, Mg. Mg has atomic weight around 24. So 7.34g Mg is 7.34 /24 ≈ 0.306 mol. But that wouldn't make sense because in that case, the moles would be higher. But maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the approach should be using the concept of equivalents. Let me think about the displacement reaction.

In such a displacement, the metal reacts with HCl to produce H2. The moles of H2 produced can be used to find the valency of X.

The problem says that 7.34g of X displaces 0.25g of H. So the moles of H released are 0.25 /1 (since H is H2 with molar mass 2g/mol) → 0.125 mol H2.

In the reaction, since each mole of X gives 1 mole of H2, the moles of X should be same as the moles of H2.

Wait, but according to the problem, moles of X would be 0.127, and moles of H2 would be 0.125. Close enough, considering rounding errors. So that suggests the reaction is 1:1.

So X is a +2 oxidation state, right? Because each X gives up 2 electrons (since it forms X^2+), which is typical for metals in +2 valent states.

Wait, but wait! Alternatively, sometimes metals can have different valencies depending on the conditions. For instance, sulfur can have +4 or +2 valencies. But in this case, the problem gives the atomic weight, which is 58.7. Let me see what element that is.

Looking up, the atomic weight of silver (Ag) is around 107.87, which is higher. Wait, maybe it's another metal. Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the atomic weight is 58.7. Let me think about the element: I'm not exactly sure, but let me check. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Wait, perhaps it's aluminum? No, aluminum is about 27. But wait, 58.7 could be another element. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should think about the molar mass of X. If the atomic weight is 58.7, then what element is that? Let me think, I might have forgotten. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reaction in terms of equivalents. The amount of X that can displace H is determined by the valence. The reaction is X being oxidized to X^2+ (valence +2), which would produce 1 mole of H2 per mole of X.

So if the moles of X is 0.127 mol, then moles of H2 is 0.127, which matches the mass given.

Wait, but the problem states that 7.34g of X displaces 0.25g of H, which is 0.125 mol. The calculation from the problem gives 0.127, which is consistent. So the valence is +2.

Looking at the options, option C is +6, option H is -3. Wait, wait, but according to this, the valence is +2, which is option H. But wait, that's not right because the options don't include H as +2. Wait, looking back:

The options are:

A: -2

B: +4

C: +6

D: +3

E: 0

F: -1

G: +5

H: +2

I: -3

J: +1

So option H is +2. So according to this, the valence is +2, which is option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the valence of X would be +2 because it's X^2+.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the general formula again. In the reaction:

X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2↑

Wait, no, that would be for X in +2 oxidation state. So if X is +2, then HCl (aq) would release H2, which is what happened in the problem.

But wait, the problem says 7.34g of X displaces 0.25g of H. So the moles of H displaced are 0.25g / 1g/mol = 0.25 mol. But wait, that can't be right because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So if the reaction is 1:1, then moles of X should equal moles of H2. But in the problem, the moles of H2 is 0.25, so moles of X is 0.25.

Wait, this is conflicting with the earlier calculation. Let me try to recalibrate.

Wait, the problem states that 7.34g of X displaces 0.25g of H. So the moles of X would be 7.34/58.7 ≈ 0.127 mol.

The moles of H displaced is 0.25g /1g/mol = 0.25 mol.

If the reaction is 1:1, then these moles would be equal, but they aren't. So we have 0.127 X vs 0.25 H2. That suggests that the stoichiometry is not 1:1.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is X + HCl → XCl + H2, and the moles of X is 0.127, which would release 0.127 H2. But the problem says 0.25g H2, which is 0.125 mol. Again, a discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the stoichiometry. Maybe the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl₂ + H₂. Let's see:

In that case, 1 mole X produces 1 mole H2. So moles of X = moles of H2.

But according to the problem, moles of H2 is 0.25, so moles of X would be 0.25. But the problem says 0.127 mol X. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it using the equivalent concept. The equivalent of X is the equivalent weight, which is its atomic weight divided by its valence. The reaction is a displacement, so the equivalents of X would be equal to the equivalents of H.

So the equivalent of X is (atomic weight) / valence. The equivalent of H is (mass of H displaced) / (atomic weight of H × valence of H). But wait, H is 1g/mol, so H's valence is 1 (since it's H2). So the equivalents of H would be (0.25g) / (1g/mol × 1) )= 0.25 equivalents.

So, the equivalents of X should be equal to the equivalents of H. Thus, (58.7 / valence of X ) = 0.25.

So,

valence of X = 58.7 / 0.25 = ?

Let me compute that: 58.7 / 0.25 = 234.8. That's way too big. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. The equivalent of H is (mass of H displaced) / (H's equivalent weight). H's valence is +2, so its equivalent weight is 1/2. So the equivalent is (0.25g) / (1 × 0.5) )= 0.25 / 0.5 = 0.5 equivalents.

Wait, but the equivalent of X should be equal to the equivalent of H. So,

(atomic weight of X) / (valence of X) = equivalents of H.

So,

58.7 / valence = 0.5 → valence = 58.7 / 0.5 = 117.4 → that's impossible because valence can't be over 18.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should take a step back.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the reaction. X is displacing H from HCl, so the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2↑. So for every mole of X, 1 mole of H2 is produced.

So moles of X = moles of H2 produced.

In the problem, moles of H2 is 0.25, so moles of X is 0.25.

But the problem states that 7.34g of X is used. So molar mass of X is 7.34 / 0.25 ≈ 29.36 g/mol. But wait, the atomic weight is given as 58.7. That's a contradiction. So that suggests that the reaction isn't 1:1. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 1:2 ratio.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2. So for each mole of X, 2 moles of HCl react, and 1 mole of H2 is produced.

Then, moles of X = moles of H2. But if the problem says H2 is 0.25 mol, then X is 0.25 mol. But the given X is 7.34g, so molar mass is 7.34/0.25 ≈ 29.36, which doesn't match 58.7.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the problem using another formula. The valence can be found based on the masses and the stoichiometry.

Another approach: Since X displaces H, and the moles of X is 7.34g /58.7 g/mol ≈ 0.127 mol.

The moles of H displaced is 0.25g /1g/mol = 0.25 mol.

In the displacement reaction, the moles of X should equal the moles of H displaced, but that leads to 0.127 = 0.25, which isn't possible. So perhaps the reaction is 1:2.

Wait, if the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2, then for each mole of X, 2 moles of HCl are consumed and 1 mole of H2 is produced.

So, moles of H2 produced is 0.25 mol, meaning moles of X used is 0.25. But the problem's X is 7.34g, so molar mass is 7.34 /0.25 ≈ 29.36 g/mol, which again doesn't match the given atomic weight of 58.7.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the problem:

The atomic weight is 58.7. So X is 58.7 g/mol. 7.34 grams of X is 0.127 moles.

It displaces 0.25 grams of H, which is 0.25 moles of H2 (since each H2 molecule is 2 H atoms).

Assuming the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2. Then, moles of X required is 0.25, but in the problem, it's 0.127. So that's a discrepancy. So perhaps the reaction is 1 mole X per 2 moles HCl, but that leads to H2 produced being 0.127, which doesn't match the 0.25.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 1 mole X per 1 mole HCl, but that would mean XCl is formed, which doesn't make sense because X is displacing H.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it using the concept of equivalents.

The equivalents of H are (mass H displaced) × (atomic weight H) / (valence of H). Since H is in +1 oxidation state, valence is 1. So,

equivalents of H = (0.25 g) × 1 × (1) /1 = 0.25 equivalents.

Since the reaction is a displacement, the equivalents of X must equal the equivalents of H. So,

equivalents of X = (atomic weight of X) / (valence of X) = 58.7 / V = 0.25.

So, solving for V,

V = 58.7 / 0.25 = 234.8.

But valence can't be over 20, so this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2. So, in this reaction, 1 mole of X produces 1 mole of H2. So moles of X = moles of H2.

But in the problem, moles of H2 is 0.25, so moles of X should be 0.25.

But the problem says 7.34g of X, which is 7.34 /58.7 ≈ 0.127 mol. So that's a problem. Because 0.127 mol X can't produce 0.25 mol H2.

So, perhaps the reaction is X + HCl → XCl + H2, and the moles of X is 0.25, which would produce 0.25 mol H2. But the problem's X is 0.127 mol, which produces 0.127 mol H2. But the problem says H2 is 0.25 mol. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2, and the moles of X is 0.25, so H2 is 0.25. But the problem's X is 0.127, which is less than 0.25. So again, a problem.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of the problem in terms of the valency of X. Let me set up the equation.

Let the valency of X be V. Then, the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2↑.

In this reaction, one mole of X reacts to produce one mole of H2. So moles of X = moles of H2.

But in the problem, moles of H2 is 0.25. So moles of X is 0.25.

But the problem states that the moles of X is 0.127. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl + H2. So, in this case, 1 mole of X produces 1 mole of H2. So moles of X = moles of H2.

But in the problem, moles of H2 is 0.25, so moles of X is 0.25. But the problem's X is 0.127.

So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the reaction is 1 mole X produces 2 moles H2.

So, 1 mole X → 2 moles H2.

In that case, moles of X = moles of H2 / 2.

So, moles of X would be 0.25 / 2 = 0.125.

Which is close to the 0.127 given in the problem.

So, perhaps the reaction is X + 2 HCl → XCl2 + H2↑.

In that case, the moles of X is 0.125, and moles of H2 is 0.125.

So, the valency of X is +2.

So, the answer would be option H, which is +2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the valence of X would be +2, but then I thought perhaps the valence is +6, which would make the molar mass 58.7 = 6 × valency → valency would be about 9.77, which is impossible. So, no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the valency is +4. 58.7 =4 × valency → valency is 14.675, which is also impossible.

Wait, but the options don't include +6 or others, so perhaps the correct answer is +2.

But wait, let me think again. If X is displacing H, and the atomic weight is 58.7, which is close to the atomic weight of Ca (40.08) or something like that. Wait, no, Ca is about 40. So 58.7 is more like Ag (107.87), but that's way higher.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a higher atomic weight but lower valency. That's possible. For example, some transition metals can have variable valencies.

Wait, perhaps the valency of X is +2. Because in that case, the molar mass of X is 58.7, so X would be Ca, but Ca has a higher atomic weight. Wait, no, Ca is 40. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the equivalent of X and equate it to the equivalent of H.

The equivalent of H is (mass of H displaced) × (atomic weight of H) / (valence of H). Since H is in +1 oxidation state, valence is 1.

So,

equivalent of H = (0.25 g) × 1 /1 = 0.25 equivalents.

Since the reaction is a displacement, the equivalents of X must equal the equivalents of H. So,

(atomic weight of X) / (valence of X) = 0.25.

So,

58.7 / V = 0.25 → V = 58.7 / 0.25 = 234.8.

But valence can't be more than 18 for transition metals. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the reaction is not a displacement but a different kind of reaction.

Wait, but the problem states that element X displaces H from HCl. So the reaction is a displacement.

Hence, perhaps the correct answer is that X has a valency of +2, but the calculation suggests otherwise.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the valence.

Given:

atomic weight of X = 58.7 g/mol

mass of X = 7.34 g

moles of X = 7.34 /58.7 ≈ 0.127 mol

mass of H2 produced = 0.25 g

moles of H2 = 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 mol

since the reaction is 1:1, so moles of X should equal moles of H2. But in reality, they don't.

So perhaps the reaction is 1:2.

So, moles of X = 0.25, moles of H2 = 0.25 × 2 = 0.5 → again, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is to realize that the valence is +2 because in the reaction, X is oxidized to X^2+.

So, the answer is option H, which is +2.
</think>

The problem involves determining the valence of element X based on the given data. Here's the analysis:

1. **Atomic Weight and Moles of X**:  
   The atomic weight of X is 58.7 g/mol, and 7.34 g of X is used.  
   Moles of X = \( \frac{7.34}{58.7} \approx 0.127 \) mol.

2. **Mass of H2 Displaced**:  
   0.25 g of H is displaced, and since H2 is formed (each H2 molecule contains 2 H atoms), the moles of H2 produced are:  
   Moles of H2 = \( \frac{0.25}{2} = 0.125 \) mol.

3. **Reaction and Equivalence**:  
   The reaction is assumed to be \( \text{X} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{XCl}_2 + \text{H}_2 \), where 1 mole of X produces 1 mole of H2.  
   According to this reaction, the moles of X should equal the moles of H2. However, the actual moles of X (0.127 mol) do not match the moles of H2 (0.125 mol), indicating a discrepancy.

4. **Valence of X**:  
   In the reaction, X is oxidized to \( \text{X}^{2+} \), which has a valence of +2. This is consistent with the reaction mechanism and the data provided.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The valence of X is determined to be +2, as it is oxidized to \( \text{X}^{2+} \) in the reaction.

ANSWER: H
