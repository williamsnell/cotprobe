Okay, let's try to figure out this lottery probability question. Hmm, so the problem is about calculating the probability of winning in a state lottery where four digits are drawn one at a time with replacement from 0 to 9. The winning condition is that any permutation of the selected integers is drawn. I need to find the probability if I select the numbers 6,7,8,9.

Wait, wait, wait. So I'm selecting four digits: 6,7,8,9. Since the order doesn't matter in a win, any permutation of these four digits would win. So the winning condition is that the four specific digits are drawn in any order.

But how do I calculate the probability of that happening? Let me think. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of possible four-digit combinations with replacement. Since each digit is from 0-9 and there's replacement, each digit is independent. So for each draw, there are 10 possibilities. But since four digits are drawn, the total number of possible sequences is 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 10,000. So 10^4 equals 10,000 possible outcomes.

Now, how many of these outcomes are winning ones? Well, the winning condition is that the four digits are exactly 6,7,8,9, regardless of order. So the winning sequences are all the permutations of these four distinct digits.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, do all the digits have to be unique? The problem says "any permutation of your selected integers is drawn." So if any permutation is drawn, you win. So if any of the four digits is 6,7,8,9, but wait no, wait, the selected integers are 6,7,8,9. So the winning condition is that the four digits drawn are exactly 6,7,8,9, in any order. So each of the four digits has to be one of these four, and all four must be present.

Wait, but in that case, how many such sequences are there? Since each digit is distinct, the number of permutations is 4 factorial, which is 4! = 24. So there are 24 winning sequences.

So the probability of winning is the number of winning sequences divided by the total possible sequences. So 24 / 10,000.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure that's correct. Because the digits are drawn with replacement, meaning that each can be any digit from 0-9, including duplicates, but for the winning condition, you have to have all four digits as 6,7,8,9, but each can be drawn multiple times. So yes, the winning sequences are those where each of the four digits is 6,7,8, or 9, and each is present exactly once. So the number of such sequences is indeed 4! = 24.

So the probability is 24 / 10^4. Let's compute that: 24 divided by 10,000. 24 / 10000 is 0.0024.

Wait a second, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The problem says "any permutation of your selected integers is drawn." So if you selected 6,7,8,9, and the lottery draws 6,7,8,9 in any order, you win. So the winning condition is exactly that.

Is there any chance I can have a duplicate digit? For example, could the lottery draw 6,7,8,8? Then, the selected digits are 6,7,8,9, but the drawn digits are 6,7,8,8. So the selected digits are 6,7,8,9, and the drawn digits are 6,7,8,8. That wouldn't meet the condition because you need all four digits to be exactly 6,7,8,9. So you can't have a duplicate in the drawn digits.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says "any permutation of your selected integers is drawn." So the four selected digits are 6,7,8,9. So the lottery draws four digits, each of which is from 0-9 with replacement. The winning condition is that any permutation of your selected integers (6,7,8,9) is drawn. So that means the four digits drawn must be exactly 6,7,8,9, each appearing exactly once. Because if any of them are duplicated, then the permutation won't match your selected digits.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the permutation is any rearrangement of your selected digits. So if the lottery draws 6,7,8,9 in any order, that's a win. So the winning condition is that the four digits drawn are exactly 6,7,8,9, regardless of order. So the four digits drawn must be 6,7,8,9, each appearing exactly once. So the number of winning sequences is 4! = 24.

So yes, 24 winning sequences. Therefore, the probability is 24 / 10,000.

Let me compute that. 24 รท 10000. 24 / 10000 equals 0.0024.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.0024. So the correct answer is G.

The probability is calculated by dividing the number of winning sequences (24, as each of the four digits is distinct and can be arranged in 4! ways) by the total number of possible sequences (10^4 = 10,000). This gives 24/10,000 = 0.0024.

Answer: G: 0.0024
