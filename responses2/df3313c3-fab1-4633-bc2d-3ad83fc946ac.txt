Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

All of the following statements are true EXCEPT

Options:

A: insulin decreases storage of glycogen
B: growth hormone stimulates cell division and protein synthesis
C: epinephrine increases blood sugar levels and heart rate
D: thyroxine increases the rate of metabolism
E: vasopressin stimulates water reabsorption in the kidney

Answer:

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these statements is false. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Insulin decreases glycogen storage. I remember that insulin is a hormone that promotes glycogen breakdown. It's involved in the process of gluconeogenesis, where glucose is broken down into glucose-6-phosphate, which then enters the cells to be used. So, without insulin, the cells would store more glycogen. So A sounds correct, so this statement is probably true.

Option B: Growth hormone stimulates cell division and protein synthesis. Growth hormone is crucial for cell elongation and growth. It helps cells divide and grows tissues. So B is also true.

Option C: Epinephrine increases blood sugar and heart rate. Epinephrine is the same as adrenaline. I recall that it's a hormone that can actually increase blood sugar levels because it's a stimulant. It can also cause heartbeats, like加快心跳. So C is correct, so this is a true statement.

Option D: Thyroxine increases metabolism. Thyroxine, or trihydroxylamine, is involved in metabolism, especially in the liver. It helps in the synthesis of amino acids and other large molecules. It also plays a role in the immune system and metabolism. So D is true.

Option E: Vasopressin stimulates water reabsorption in the kidneys. Vasopressin is a hormone that controls water reabsorption in the kidneys. It helps kidneys to take in water, which keeps the blood pressure low. So E is true too.

Wait, all the options seem to state true facts. But the question says one is false. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me double-check each statement.

A: Insulin decreases glycogen storage. Oh wait, no! Insulin actually promotes glycogen breakdown, so it would increase storage. So A is false. So if all others are true, A would be the exception. So the question is which is NOT true. So the incorrect statement is A.

The correct answer is **A**, as insulin decreases glycogen storage, which is incorrect. Insulin actually promotes glycogen breakdown.

Answer: A
