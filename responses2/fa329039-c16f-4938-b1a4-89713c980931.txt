Okay, so I have this question about estimating the final inventory at Firestone's Clothing Store. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the store had an inventory of $2,300 on August 1. Then, during August, they made new purchases totaling $1,125. Sales were $3,485. The margin on sales is 18%, and we need to estimate the final inventory on August 31.

Wait, what does margin on sales mean here? I think it refers to the markup. Like, the margin is the profit, which is 18% of sales. So maybe the cost of goods sold (COGS) is 82% of sales because 100 - 18% = 82%. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. If the margin is 18%, does that mean the cost is 82% of sales? Or is it the selling price that includes the margin, so cost is 100% minus 18%?

Wait, no, actually, margin is sometimes calculated as (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price. So if the margin is 18%, that would mean (S - C)/S = 0.18. So S - C = 0.18 S => C = S - 0.18 S = 0.82 S. So the cost is 82% of the selling price. So COGS would be $3,485 * 0.82.

Wait, but another approach is to calculate the cost of goods sold based on the sales. So if margin is 18%, then the cost is 82% of what they sold. So COGS would be $3,485 * (1 - 0.18) = $3,485 * 0.82.

Let me compute that. 3485 * 0.82. Let's see: 3000 * 0.82 = 2460, 485 * 0.82= around 485 * 0.8= 388, 485 *0.02=9.7 → total ≈ 388+9.7=397.7. So 2460 + 397.7 = approximately 2857.7. So COGS is about $2,857.70.

Wait, but what about the purchases? So they made new purchases of $1,125. But wait, in a typical business context, purchases would be part of the inventory. So the initial inventory is $2,300. Then during the month, they buy more, so the total inventory before sales would be initial + purchases. But wait, does the purchases affect the inventory? Let me think.

Wait, the question says, "new merchandise purchases". So during the month, they buy more, but do those purchases reduce the inventory? Or are they added to the inventory? Oh wait, in a typical business, purchases would be added to the inventory, but wait, in accounting, the inventory increases when you purchase new stock. So if the store makes additional purchases, that would increase the inventory. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial inventory is on August 1. Then during August, they make purchases. So, the inventory would increase by the amount of new purchases. So the total available for sale would be initial inventory plus purchases. But wait, that's not correct. Let's think of it as: each month, the inventory starts with whatever you have on hand, then you make purchases, which go into the inventory. But then, sales would reduce the inventory. So the formula for ending inventory is: beginning inventory + purchases - COGS.

Wait, that's the formula. So let me write that down. Ending inventory = (Beginning Inventory) + Purchases - COGS.

So in this case, beginning inventory is $2,300. Purchases are $1,125. COGS is $2,857.70.

So adding beginning inventory and purchases: 2300 + 1125 = 3425.

Then subtract COGS: 3425 - 2857.70 = 567.30.

Wait, so the ending inventory would be $567.30. Looking at the options, option B is $567.30. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Is the 18% margin applied to the cost, or to the sales? Because that affects COGS. Let me recheck that part.

If the margin on sales is 18%, does that mean the cost is 82% of sales, as I thought earlier, or is the margin on cost 18%?

Wait, the question says 'margin on sales was 18%'. So perhaps it's the profit margin, which is calculated as (Selling Price - Cost)/Selling Price. So in that case, selling price is higher than cost. So COGS would be Selling Price - (Selling Price * 18%). So COGS is 82% of Selling Price.

So that's correct as I did earlier. COGS = $3,485 *0.82 = $2,857.70.

So the ending inventory is beginning inventory + purchases - COGS. 2300 +1125 = 3425. 3425 - 2857.70 = 567.30. So option B.

So the final answer should be option B: $567.30.

The question requires estimating the final inventory on August 31 for Firestone's Clothing Store. The store starts with an inventory of $2,300 on August 1. During August, new merchandise purchases amount to $1,125, and sales are $3,485 with a margin on sales of 18%. 

To calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS), we first determine the cost basis. A 18% margin implies that COGS is 82% of sales (since 100% - 18% = 82%). Thus, COGS = $3,485 * 0.82 = $2,857.70. 

The ending inventory is calculated as:
Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - COGS  
Ending Inventory = $2,300 + $1,125 - $2,857.70  
Ending Inventory = $567.30  

Therefore, the estimated final inventory on August 31 is **$567.30**.
