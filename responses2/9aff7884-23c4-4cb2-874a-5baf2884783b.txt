Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this question about the functions of money. The question is asking which function of money best defines $1.25 as the price of a 20-ounce bottle of pop. The options are A through J, each representing a different function of money.

Let me start by recalling what each function of money entails. 

First, the store of value function means that money can be held onto for its future value, like coins in a piggy bank. But the question is about a price, so maybe this isn't the right fit.

Medium of exchange is another function. This allows people to buy goods and services by exchanging money instead of barter. The question mentions a price, so this could be relevant because money is being exchanged.

Unit of account refers to money being used to measure prices. For example, dollars are units of account. If $1.25 is the price of something, then it's a unit of account. So this sounds promising.

Measure of liquidity is another option. Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be turned into cash. But the question is about a price, not liquidity.

Measure of credit would relate to how credit is valued. Not directly about the price of an item.

Indicator of wealth would be about how much wealth a person has. Again, not directly about the price.

Standard for deferred payment—this seems like a function of money, but I'm not sure if it's the best fit here.

Mode of transfer—this refers to how money is used to transfer value, like in a check or a transfer of ownership.

Transfer of ownership is more about ownership, not prices.

Benchmark of exchange rate—this relates to how money is valued, but not specifically about the price of an item.

Wait, let me think again. The question says $1.25 is the price of a pop bottle. So money is used to measure the value of the item. That aligns with being a unit of account. So the unit of account is the function that defines this price.

Alternatively, the question is about defining the price. So, I think that's the unit of account. So the correct answer should be C.

I should make sure none of the other options fit. The store of value isn't about a price. Medium of exchange is about exchanging for goods, but that's more about facilitating trade, not setting a price. Unit of account directly deals with the measurement of prices. So yes, C seems correct.

The correct answer is C: Unit of account. This function allows money to measure prices, and in this case, $1.25 is used to price the 20-ounce bottle of pop, fulfilling the unit of account role. 

Answer: C
