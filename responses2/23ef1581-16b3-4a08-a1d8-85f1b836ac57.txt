Okay, so I have this question about ReLU and sigmoid functions, and their gradients. Hmm, let me think this through. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to piece it together.

Statement 1 says that the ReLU's gradient is zero for x < 0. Right, ReLU is Rectified Linear Unit. The formula is f(x) = max(0, x). So the derivative is 0 when x < 0, and 1 otherwise. So yes, statement 1 is true.

Statement 1 also mentions that the sigmoid gradient σ(x)(1-σ(x)) is ≤ 1/4 for all x. Wait, what's the derivative of the sigmoid function? Oh right, the derivative is σ(x)(1-σ(x)). And I remember that the maximum value of this expression occurs at x=0, right? Because σ(0) is 0.5, so 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, which is 1/4. So yes, the sigmoid's gradient never exceeds 1/4. So statement 1 is true.

Now Statement 2: The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient. Wait, ReLU's gradient is 0 for x < 0 and 1 otherwise. So it's continuous at x=0 because the left limit is 0 and the right limit is 1. So ReLU's gradient is continuous everywhere. So statement 2's first part is correct—sigmoid's gradient is continuous, and ReLU's is also continuous.

Wait, but the question says Statement 2 is about the gradients, not the functions themselves. So ReLU's gradient is 0 for x <0, 1 for x >=0. So it's a step function. So it's discontinuous at x=0. Because on the left it's 0, and on the right it's 1. So ReLU's gradient is discontinuous. So statement 2 is saying that the ReLU gradient is discontinuous, which is true. And the sigmoid's gradient is continuous, which is also true. So statement 2 is true.

Wait, no, the statement says "the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient." So statement 2 is claiming both gradients are discontinuous? Wait no, wait Statement 2 says "The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient." So the first part is correct (sigmoid's gradient is continuous), the second part is correct (ReLU's gradient is discontinuous). So statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I thought the ReLU gradient is continuous except at x=0. So statement 2's second part is correct. So statement 2 is true.

Wait, no. Wait, the statement 2 says: "The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient." So both are true. Because the sigmoid's gradient is always continuous (it never exceeds 1/4), and ReLU's gradient is discontinuous at x=0. So statement 2 is true.

But wait, looking back, the options are about each statement's truth. So statement 1 is true, statement 2 is true. So looking at the options, which one is A: both true. But I need to make sure.

Wait, but the question says: Statement 1 is true for x <0, and statement 2 is false for x≠0. Hmm, wait. Or is it that statement 1 is true for x<0, and statement 2 is false overall?

Wait, no. The initial question is about whether the statement is true or false. So I need to reevaluate.

Wait, let me re-examine each statement.

Statement 1: The ReLU's gradient is zero for x <0, and the sigmoid gradient ≤ 1/4 for all x. So statement 1 is a combination of two things. Both parts are true. So statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient. So both are true. So statement 2 is true.

But wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The question is about the truth of each statement, regardless of x.

So Statement 1 is correct because ReLU's gradient is 0 for x <0, and the sigmoid's gradient is always ≤1/4. So statement 1 is true.

Statement 2 is correct because the sigmoid's gradient is continuous (no jumps or breaks), and ReLU's gradient has a jump at x=0, so it's discontinuous. So statement 2 is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options. Option B is both true. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, wait. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Statement 1 is true for x <0, statement 2 is false for x ≠0.

Wait, that would mean statement 1 is true, and statement 2 is false. But I just concluded both are true. So if statement 2 is true, then option B (both true) would be the correct answer. But let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about the ReLU's gradient. What's the gradient for ReLU? It's zero for x <0, and 1 otherwise. So the gradient is 0 on one side, 1 on the other. So at x=0, it's a jump from 0 to 1. So the gradient is discontinuous at x=0. So statement 2's second part is correct. So statement 2 is correct.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recapitulate:

Statement 1: True, because ReLU's gradient is 0 for x<0, and sigmoid's gradient is ≤1/4.

Statement 2: True, because both gradients are continuous and discontinuous, respectively.

So both statements are true, so the answer is option B.

But wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A: Statement 1 is true for x<0, statement 2 is false for x≠0
B: True, True
C: True, False
D: Statement 1 is only true for x>0, statement 2 is always false
E: False for statement 1, statement 2 is true if x≠0
F: Statement 1 is only false for x>0, statement 2 is always true
G: False for statement 1, statement 2 is true if x=0
H: False, True
I: False, False
J: True for statement 1, statement 2 depends on the function

Wait, so the options are about whether each statement is true or not. So if statement 1 is true, statement 2 is true, then option B is correct.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Wait, statement 1 is correct, statement 2 is also correct. So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The analysis concludes that both statements are true. The ReLU's gradient is zero for x < 0 and discontinuous at x = 0, while the sigmoid's gradient is continuous and always ≤ 1/4. Therefore, the correct option is:
