Okay, so I have this series to analyze: the sum from n=0 to infinity of (n!)/(n² cos(n)). I need to determine whether it converges or diverges. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, looking at the general term of the series: a_n = n!/(n² cos(n)). I remember that factorials grow really fast, like n! increases faster than any exponential function. So the numerator is going to get huge as n increases. The denominator is n² multiplied by cos(n). Cos(n) oscillates between -1 and 1 because cosine of integer multiples of π alternates between 1 and -1. Wait, does that mean cos(n) is actually oscillating? Because n is an integer, but cosine of integers isn't exactly the same as cosine of multiples of π. Wait, cos(n) isn't exactly periodic in the same way as cosine(kπ) where k is integer. Let me think, for integer n, cos(n) is not exactly oscillating between 1 and -1 because n isn't a multiple of π. So actually, cos(n) can be any value between -1 and 1, but not exactly one of those points. So cos(n) could be approaching zero sometimes, but it's not exactly zero. So that might affect the behavior.

Now, considering the general term a_n: n! grows much faster than any polynomial or exponential function, so n!/(n²) is going to dominate the denominator. But cos(n) isn't zero, so the denominator isn't exactly zero. So the term is going to be n!/(n² * |cos(n)|) because cos(n) can be negative, so |cos(n)| is positive. Hmm, so the term's magnitude is n!/(n² * |cos(n)|).

Wait, but the absolute value of cos(n) is always positive but can be as small as approaching zero. So the denominator is getting smaller when |cos(n)| is small, which would make the term's magnitude large. So in regions where cos(n) is near zero, the term could be very large, making the series possibly divergent.

But wait, wait. The series is sum a_n, and for convergence, we usually check whether the terms approach zero. Because if the terms don't approach zero, the series definitely diverges. So let's check the limit of a_n as n approaches infinity.

The limit of a_n as n approaches infinity is lim_{n→∞} n!/(n² cos(n)). Since n! grows faster than any polynomial, but in the denominator, cos(n) can be as small as approaching zero, which would make the denominator approach zero. So the term could approach infinity if cos(n) approaches zero. But wait, cos(n) doesn't approach zero; it oscillates. So in regions where cos(n) is near zero, the term a_n might be very large, but is that enough to make the series diverge?

Hmm, but for the series to converge, the limit of a_n as n approaches infinity must be zero. Since a_n doesn't approach zero (it can be large), the series diverges. So the series doesn't converge.

Looking at the options, the choices are whether it converges, diverges, or other options. So the correct answer should be D: Diverges.

The general term of the series is \( a_n = \frac{n!}{n^2 \cos(n)} \). As \( n \) grows, \( n! \) grows faster than any polynomial or exponential function. The denominator \( n^2 \cos(n) \) oscillates because \( \cos(n) \) oscillates between -1 and 1. However, the key point is that \( \cos(n) \) is never exactly zero, so the denominator is always non-zero. The term's magnitude is \( \frac{n!}{n^2 |\cos(n)|} \), which grows without bound as \( n \) increases because \( n! \) grows faster than \( n^2 \). 

For the series to converge, the general term \( a_n \) must approach zero as \( n \) approaches infinity. However, \( a_n \) does not approach zero because the denominator can be as small as \( n^2 \) (when \( |\cos(n)| \) is near 1), making the term large. Therefore, the series diverges.

Answer: D: Diverges
