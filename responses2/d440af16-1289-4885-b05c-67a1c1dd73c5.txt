Alright, so I've got this question about the kidney and blood vessels. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is asking which cluster of blood capillaries is found in each nephron, which is each kidney. The options are A through J, all related to different parts of the kidney's nephra.

First, I should remember what each part of the nephron consists of. I think the nephron is made up of the glomerulus, the loop of Henle, and the two convoluted tubules. The glomerulus is a cluster of tiny capillaries that form part of the nephron. The loop of Henle is a long tube that loops around the glomerulus, and the two convoluted tubules are the upper and lower parts of the loop.

Now, the question is about the blood capillaries in each nephron. I remember that the glomerulus itself is made up of many capillaries, so that's part of what's called the afferent arteriole. Wait, no, wait. Afferent arteriole refers to the capillaries that branch out to the afferent arteriole. The afferent arteriole is the capillary network that connects to the glomerulus. So the glomerulus is composed of the afferent arteriole, which is the blood capillaries.

So each nephron (each kidney) has a glomerulus, which is a cluster of blood capillaries. So the correct answer should be option A, which is "Afferent arteriole." Because the afferent arteriole is the blood capillaries that form the glomerulus. 

But wait, let me make sure. Sometimes I mix up some terms. The afferent arteriole is the capillaries that feed into the glomerulus. So each nephron's blood supply is the afferent arteriole. So the cluster is the afferent arteriole. 

Other options: B is the glomerulus, which is the entire structure, not just the capillaries. C is Renal medulla, which I think refers to the inner workings and the loop. D is the proximal convoluted tubule, which is part of the loop. E is efferent arteriole, which is the capillaries that come out of the nephron and go to the collecting ducts. So the efferent is the outflow, not the input. F is loop of Henle, which is part of the nephron structure, not the capillaries. G is the distal convoluted tubule, another part of the loop. H is the renal pelvis, I is the bowman's capsule, and J is the renal capsule. Those are structures around or enclosing the nephron, not the capillaries.

So the correct answer is A: Afferent arteriole.

The correct answer is **A: Afferent arteriole**. The afferent arteriole consists of the blood capillaries that form the glomerulus of each nephron, providing the capillary network that connects to the glomerulus. Other options correctly describe different parts of the kidney's structure, such as the glomerulus (B), the loop of Henle (F), or the two convoluted tubules (D and G). 

Answer: A
