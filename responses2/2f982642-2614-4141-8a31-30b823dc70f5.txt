Okay, so I have this question about deposition procedures. Hmm, let's think. The question is about where to provide confidential client information during a deposition. I remember that in legal settings, especially in deposition, it's all about confidentiality and the client's rights.

The attorney asks me to provide confidential information. So, what's the protocol here? I think the general rule is that you can't provide information without consent, but there are exceptions. Oh right, privilege is a big one. If the client's attorney has already waived the privilege, then you can give the information without asking.

Looking at the options, option G says "provide the information since privilege is waived." That makes sense because if the privilege has been released, you're free to give the information. But wait, I should make sure there are no other rules that could override that.

Option E says "refuse to provide the information unless the client is present." That doesn't sound right. You shouldn't refuse unless you know the client is present, but that's not the case here. The question is about when to provide the info, not when not to.

Option A talks about favorable light. I don't think that's the standard rule. The primary concern is whether the client has given permission or whether the privilege is already released.

Option C mentions if you believe it's pertinent. That's a bit vague and doesn't cover the privilege aspect. It's more about belief than actual condition.

Option D is about the opposing attorney's stance. I don't think that's a standard rule either. The focus is on whether the client has given permission or if the privilege was released.

Option F suggests discarding info if it's been a reasonable time since the client-attorney ended the relationship. That seems too vague and doesn't address the actual legal principle.

Option I says to assert privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. That's the opposite of what's needed because if the privilege is already released, you don't need to assert it unless required by a waiver.

Option J is refusing without a court order. That's definitely not a legal ground. You have to have either a waiver or the privilege released for that.

So, the only option that correctly reflects the standard practice is G. If privilege is waived, you can provide the information without asking. That's the key point here, so I should choose G.

The correct answer is G: provide the information if the opposing party's attorney insists.
