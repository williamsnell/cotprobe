Okay, so I've got this question here about Peter's pay increase. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Let's see, Peter works 38 hours a week and makes $7.25 per hour. His employer raises his gross pay to $307.80, and I need to find out how much the increase is.

Hmm, so first, I should find out how much Peter was making before the raise. Oh wait, his current weekly gross pay is calculated by multiplying hours by the hourly rate. So before the raise, his pay was 38 hours times $7.25 per hour. Let me calculate that. 

38 multiplied by 7 is 266, and 38 multiplied by 0.25 is 9.5. So adding those together, 266 + 9.5 equals $275.50. So Peter used to make $275.50 per week.

Now, after the raise, he makes $307.80. So the increase is the difference between these two amounts. Let me subtract 275.50 from 307.80. 

307.80 minus 275.50. Let me see, 307 minus 275 is 32, and 0.80 minus 0.50 is 0.30. So that makes $32.30. 

Looking at the options, option A is $32.30. So the increase is $32.30. I think that's the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't mess up. 

Wait, another way to check is to add the $32.30 to his original $275.50. 275.50 plus 32.30. 275 +32 is 307, and 0.50 +0.30 is 0.80. So 307.80, which matches the new amount. Yep, that looks right. So the correct option is A.

The increase in Peter's weekly gross pay is calculated by subtracting his original pay from the new pay. His original gross pay was $275.50, and after the raise, it is $307.80. 

307.80 - 275.50 = $32.30.

The correct answer is **A: $32.30**.
