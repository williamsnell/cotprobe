Okay, so I have this problem about waiting times for a roller coaster. Let me read it again. The waiting times are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. There were 150,000 riders in the first summer, and the question is asking for the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. The options are A to J, each giving different time intervals.

Hmm, wait. So, the mean is 35, standard deviation 10. So, the distribution is N(35,10). The first thing I think is that we need to find a range of times where 100,000 out of 150,000 are within. But wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Does it mean 100,000 riders fall within a certain time interval, or does it mean that the interval is such that 100,000 are in that interval? I think it's the former: 100,000 riders are in that interval, and we need to find the interval that's the shortest possible.

Wait, but normally, in normal distributions, the interval that contains a certain percentage of the data is symmetric around the mean. So, for example, about 68% of the data is within ±1σ, 95% within ±2σ, 99.7% within ±3σ.

But in this case, the 100,000 vs 150,000. So, 100,000 is two-thirds of 150,000. So, perhaps the interval that covers two-thirds of the population. I'm trying to remember the normal distribution percentiles. Let me think: the 50th percentile is the mean, so 50% is at 35. The 75th percentile is 35 + 0.6745σ, which is 35 + 6.745 = 41.745. The 25th percentile is 35 - 6.745 = 28.255. Wait, but wait, that's for 75% and 25% because in a normal distribution, 50% is the mean, 68% is within one st dev, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the data is spread. So, in a normal distribution, the area under the curve represents the probability. So, the probability that a rider's time is between a and b is determined by the z-scores for a and b.

The problem is about the shortest interval that contains 100,000 out of 150,000. Since the total is 150,000, the interval we're looking for needs to contain 100,000, which is 2/3 of the riders. So, how much of the distribution does 100,000 represent in terms of percentiles.

Wait, perhaps we can model it as finding the interval where 100,000 are included. So, the 100,000 is 2/3 of 150,000. I need to find the interval [a, b] such that P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = 100,000 / 150,000 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

But wait, in the context of the normal distribution, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the probability that X ≤ x. So, to find a and b such that the integral from a to b equals 2/3.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think in terms of percentiles. The 33.333% and 66.666% would correspond to the lower and upper bounds of the interval that contains 100,000 riders.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 33.333% is the lower bound, and the 66.666% is the upper bound. That would mean the interval from the 33.333rd percentile to the 66.666th percentile. Because the area under the curve between these two points would represent 100,000 out of 150,000.

So, let me calculate the z-scores for these percentiles. For a normal distribution, the z-score for the 33.333rd percentile is approximately -0.43, and for the 66.666th percentile is about +0.43. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact z-scores. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up that the 66.666% is about z=0.43. Let me think: the 50th is 0, the 84.13th is 1, so 66.666 is roughly 0.43 z-scores above the mean.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me recall that the 33.333rd percentile is the same as 1/3, and the 66.666th is the same as 2/3.

Wait, let me think: the 50th percentile is 35. The 33.333rd percentile is 1/3 below the mean, and the 66.666th is 1/3 above.

Alternatively, perhaps using the standard normal distribution table.

I think for the 33.333rd percentile, the z-score is -0.43, and for the 66.666th, it's approximately +0.43.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the 33.333rd percentile is about -0.43, and the 66.666th is about +0.43.

Wait, let me think again. The standard normal distribution's z-scores for the 33.333rd and 66.666th percentiles are approximately -0.43 and +0.43, respectively. Because the 50th is 0. The 33.333rd is 0.43 below the mean? No, wait, the 33.333rd percentile is to the left of the mean. So, the z-score is negative.

Wait, let me get some exact z-values. For example, for the 33.333rd percentile in a standard normal distribution, I think the z-score is approximately -0.43. Let me confirm that. Because the standard normal distribution table tells me that 0.333 corresponds to about z=-0.43.

So, the lower bound a is 35 - 0.43 * 10 = 35 -4.3 = 30.7 minutes.

The upper bound b is 35 + 0.43 *10 = 35 +4.3=39.3.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait a minute, if 33.333% is the 33.333 percentile, then the z-score would be around -0.43 for that. So, a is 35 - 4.3 = 30.7, and b is 35 +4.3=39.3.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 25.3 to 39.3, which is 39.3 as the upper bound. Option B's upper is 44.7, which is higher. So, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the percentiles and the z-scores.

Wait, the z-scores for the 33.333rd and 66.666th percentiles: Let me think of the standard normal distribution. The 50th percentile is 0. The 68th is about 0.43 (wait, no, 68 is 1 sigma, but perhaps I'm mixing things up).

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator or a precise table. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the exact z-scores.

Alternatively, I can think of the 33.333% as equivalent to 1/3. So, the cumulative probability up to a is 1/3.

Using the inverse standard normal function, z = NORMSINV(0.333333333). Let me compute that.

Looking up 0.333333333 in the standard normal table. Wait, the 33.3333% is equivalent to 0.3333 as a probability. Let me think: the standard normal distribution's z for p=0.3333 is about -0.43, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, I can use a calculator for more accurate value.

If I use the formula: z = (X - μ) / σ, but in this case, we want to find X such that P(X <= a) = 0.3333333.

So, a = μ + z * σ.

So, for z = -0.43, a = 35 + (-0.43)*10 = 35 -4.3 =30.7.

Similarly, for b = 35 +0.43*10=39.3.

But wait, then the interval is 30.7 to 39.3. But looking at the options, option A is 25.3 to 39.3, which is shorter.

Wait, but that can't be right because 25.3 is much lower. How can the interval be shorter than that? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the percentiles. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the shortest time interval that contains 100,000 riders out of 150,000. So, 100,000 is two-thirds of 150,000. So, the interval should capture 2/3 of the population.

Alternatively, perhaps the interval is such that the area under the curve is 2/3, and the interval is centered around the mean, which is 35.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the z-scores for the 1/3 and 2/3 percentiles. Let me think: the 1/3 percentile is 33.333% from the left, so the area from the left up to that point is 1/3. Similarly, the 2/3 is the area up to that point.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the interval that contains 100,000 riders. So, that's 100,000 /150,000 = 2/3.

So, perhaps the interval is from the 1/3 percentile to the 2/3 percentile.

Wait, no, wait. Because from the left, 1/3 is the 33.333rd percentile, and 2/3 is the 66.666th. So, the portion between these two points is 2/3 of the total, or 66.666% -33.333% = 33.333% of the data. So that's 1/3 of the data. But 100,000 is 2/3, so perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting what the interval represents. Let me think again. The problem says that 100,000 riders fall within a certain time interval. So, the interval is [a, b], and the probability that a rider's time is between a and b is 100,000 /150,000 = 2/3.

So, P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = 2/3.

So, the interval [a, b] represents the middle 2/3 of the distribution.

In a normal distribution, the middle 2/3 of the data would be from the 1/3 percentile to the 2/3 percentile. Wait, no. Wait, the middle 2/3 would be from the 1/3 percentile (since 1/3 is the lower 33.33%) to the 2/3 percentile (66.666% from the left), or maybe the other way around.

Wait, in a distribution, the 33.333rd percentile is the point below which 33.333% of the data lies. So, the interval from the 33.333rd percentile to the 66.666th percentile would capture 33.333% of the distribution (since 66.666 -33.333 = 33.333%). But wait, that's 1/3 of the data.

But we need an interval that captures 2/3 of the data. So, perhaps the interval should be from the 1/3 percentile to the 2/3 percentile, which would capture 2/3 of the data? Wait, no, because 2/3 -1/3 =1/3. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Or perhaps it's the other way: from the 33.333rd to the 66.666th, which is 33.333% of the data.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the standard normal distribution. The 33.333rd percentile (0.3333) z-score is approximately -0.43. The 66.666th percentile (0.6666) is approximately +0.43.

So, the interval from μ - 0.43σ to μ + 0.43σ would capture the middle 33.333% of the data. Wait, but 0.6666 -0.3333=0.3333, so 33.333% of the data is in the interval. So, to capture 2/3, the interval must be from the 1/3 percentile to the 2/3 percentile.

So, let's calculate the z-scores for these. The 1/3 percentile is 33.333% from the left, which is a z-score of about -0.43. The 2/3 percentile is 66.666% from the left, which is a z-score of about +0.43.

So, the interval would be from μ -0.43σ to μ +0.43σ. So, μ is 35, σ is 10. So, 35 -4.3=30.7 and 35+4.3=39.3.

So, the interval is 30.7 to 39.3. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 25.3 to 39.3, which is much lower. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the shortest interval that contains 100,000 riders. So, perhaps the interval isn't symmetric around the mean. But in a normal distribution, intervals are symmetric, so the shortest interval containing 100,000 riders is the one around the mean. 

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the z-scores. Let me recheck the z-scores. So, the 33.333rd percentile is z = -0.43. The 66.666th is z=+0.43. So, the interval is 35 ±4.3, which is 30.7 to 39.3.

Looking at the options, the option A is 25.3 to 39.3. Hmm, why is that? Because another approach might involve the 33.333rd and 66.666th as the endpoints, but perhaps I'm misapplying the percentiles.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the 100,000 riders as 2/3 of the 150,000, but the interval isn't symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the interval is from 35 - 0.66666666667 *10 to 35 +0.66666666667 *10? Let me calculate that.

0.66666666667 *10 is about 6.6666666667. So, 35 -6.6666666667 =28.333333333, and 35 +6.6666666667=41.666666667. But that's way higher than any option, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the interval is [35 - (2/3)10, 35 + (2/3)10 ]? So, (2/3)*10=6.6666666667. So, 35-6.666666=28.3333, 35+6.666666=41.666666. But again, the options don't have that. So, perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 100,000 riders correspond to the middle 2/3 interval, but that would require a different z-score.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the two z-scores that capture 2/3 of the data. Let me think: the middle 2/3 would be from the 1/3 percentile to the 2/3 percentile. So, the z-scores for 1/3 and 2/3.

Wait, for 1/3, that's 33.333% from the left. The z-score for that is approximately -0.43. For 2/3, the z-score is +0.43.

So, the interval is from 35 -0.43*10=30.7 to 35 +0.43*10=39.3. So, that's the interval that captures 33.333% of the data. But we need 2/3. So, perhaps the interval is from the 33.333% to the 66.666%, which is 33.333% of data. Wait, no, the 33.333% is lower than the 66.666%. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased as the first 100,000 riders... No, that would not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the first 100,000 riders would correspond to the first 2/3, but that also doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the 33.333% is the lower bound, and the 66.666% is the upper, so that the interval is from 30.7 to 39.3. But that's just the middle portion.

But wait, in the options, option A is 25.3 to 39.3, which is a much lower time. That's 25.3 to 39.3, which is 14 minutes. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the z-scores. Let me think again. The mean is 35, the standard deviation is 10. The 33.333rd percentile (0.3333) is z = -0.43. So, the lower bound is 35 -4.3=30.7. The upper is 35 +4.3=39.3. So, the interval is 30.7 to 39.3. But looking at the options, none of them is this. The closest is option A, which is 25.3 to 39.3. So, perhaps I'm off by 5.4 minutes in the lower end.

Wait, perhaps I should have used a higher z-score. Let me think: perhaps the 100,000 riders correspond to 100,000 out of 150,000, which is 2/3. So, the interval must capture 2/3 of the data. So, perhaps the interval is from the 1/3 percentile to the 2/3 percentile.

Wait, but in that case, the interval would be from 30.7 to 39.3, which is the middle 33.333% of the data. But the problem says to find the interval that captures 2/3 of the data, which is 100,000 out of 150,000. So, perhaps [lower, upper] is from the 1/3 percentile to the 2/3 percentile.

Wait, no, because the middle 33.333% would be from the 33.333rd to the 66.666th percentile, which is 33.333% of the data. But if we need 2/3, perhaps we should take the 1/3 to 2/3, but that's 1/3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me think about the confidence intervals. But I think the question is about the time interval within which 2/3 of the riders' times lie. So, perhaps that's the middle interval.

Wait, perhaps another way is to find the time such that 100,000 riders are willing to wait for that time. So, the first 100,000 riders would wait until 39.3 minutes, perhaps. Let me think: 100,000 out of 150,000 is 2/3. So, if the first 2/3 of the riders have waited until 39.3 minutes, then the next 1/3 waited until 39.3 plus some time.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is about the shortest time interval that 100,000 riders have waited. So, perhaps the first 100,000 riders have waited until 39.3 minutes. But that can't be right because 39.3 is just a small time, but 100,000 is a large number.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the 100,000 riders are the first portion, so they have waited until 39.3. But that's not the case because 39.3 is the upper end, but in reality, as time increases, more riders would have waited. So, perhaps the time interval is [35 - z*10, 35 + z*10], but the z is determined by the 100,000 riders.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think: the probability that a rider's time is between a and b is P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = (b -35)/(10) - (a-35)/(10) = (b -a)/10.

So, the interval [a, b] has a width of (b -a). The probability that X is between a and b is (b -a)/10.

We need (b -a)/10 = 100,000 /150,000 = 2/3.

So, (b -a) = (2/3)*10 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So, the interval is of width 6.6666667 minutes. So, the interval could be anywhere, but the problem is asking for the interval associated with the first 100,000 riders. So, perhaps the first 100,000 riders have waited until 39.3 minutes. Let me think.

If the mean is 35, and the interval is 2/3 of 100,000 riders, which is 66.66666667 riders. So, perhaps the interval is from the 33.333rd to the 66.666th percentile.

Wait, let me think of the z-scores for 33.333rd and 66.666th. So, the 33.333rd percentile is at z = -0.43, and the 66.666th is at z = +0.43.

So, the interval from 35 -0.43*10=30.7 to 35 +0.43*10=39.3.

But in the options, the closest is option A: 25.3 to 39.3, which is 14 minutes lower. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the z-scores. Let me calculate 0.43 *10. 0.43 *10=4.3. So, 35-4.3=30.7, 35+4.3=39.3.

But again, the options don't have this. So, perhaps I should reconsider.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the time interval within which the first 100,000 riders waited. So, perhaps the first 100,000 riders waited until 39.3 minutes, which would imply that the interval is 35 -4.3=30.7 to 35 +4.3=39.3. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. It says, "The first 100,000 riders waited for 39.3 minutes." So, perhaps the time interval is from 30.7 to 39.3. But again, this isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the confidence interval. For example, 100,000 riders correspond to a certain confidence level. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the interval that contains 100,000 riders is the interval [μ - z*σ, μ + z*σ], where z is such that the area between -z and +z is 100,000/150,000 = 2/3.

So, z is determined by the equation that the area between -z and +z is 2/3. 

But in a standard normal distribution, the area between -z and +z is the probability that Z is between -z and +z. So, to get 2/3, we can find the z such that the area between -z and +z is 2/3.

Wait, but in a standard normal distribution, the area from -z to +z is 2z for z>0. So, to get 2/3, 2z = 2/3 → z=1/3 ≈0.3333.

Wait, that's not correct because 2z would be the area between -z and +z. So, to get 2/3 of the area between -z and +z, each side would have 1/3 of the total.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the z such that the area from -z to +z is 2/3. 

In a standard normal distribution, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the area from -infty to z. So, the area from -z to +z is CDF(z) - CDF(-z).

Since CDF(-z) = 1 - CDF(z), because of the symmetry of the normal distribution. So, the area from -z to +z is CDF(z) - (1 - CDF(z)) = 2 CDF(z) - 1.

We need this area to be 2/3. So, 2 CDF(z) -1 = 2/3 → 2 CDF(z) = 5/3 → CDF(z) = 5/6 ≈0.83333.

So, we need to find the z such that CDF(z) = 5/6 ≈0.83333.

Looking at a standard normal distribution table, the z-value where the CDF is approximately 0.83333 is about 0.9658. Wait, no, let me think: For example, z=0.9658 has CDF approximately 0.8333. Let me check that.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I can use linear approximation. So, for z=0.96, the CDF is about 0.8310, and for z=0.97, it's about 0.8413. So, to reach 0.8333, which is between 0.8310 and 0.8413, let's see.

The difference between 0.8310 and 0.8413 is 0.0103 over z from 0.96 to 0.97. So, 0.8333 -0.8310=0.0023. So, 0.0023/0.0103 ≈0.222 of the interval. So, z ≈0.96 +0.222*(0.01)=0.96 +0.00222=0.96222.

So, approximately z=0.9622. So, the area between -0.9622 and +0.9622 is 2/3.

So, the interval is [35 -0.9622*10, 35 +0.9622*10]. So, 0.9622*10=9.622. So, 35-9.622=25.378, and 35+9.622=44.622.

Looking at the options, option A is 25.3 to 39.3, which is much lower than 25.378. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

So, looking at these intervals, option A is 2.25–2.5, which is much lower. But none of the options seem to match my calculation here. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the options are for other problems, and I'm confusing with them. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the z-score for the 2/3 area. So, if the area between -z and +z is 2/3, then the z-score is approximately 0.9622. So, using that, the interval is 35 -0.9622*10=35-9.622=25.378, and 35+0.9622*10=44.622. 

But looking at the options, the closest is option B:31.5–41.7. Hmm. So, perhaps I should reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the area between -0.9622 and +0.9622, which is 2/3. But let me compute it numerically.

So, the area is from -z to +z where z=0.9622. So, CDF(z) - CDF(-z) = 2z -1. 

Wait, in this case, 2z -1 = 2*(0.9622) -1 = 1.9244 -1=0.9244. So, wait, that's 0.9244, which is approximately 92.44% of the area, not 66.66%. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation earlier.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the problem. Let me think: perhaps the problem is to find the time interval such that the probability that a rider waits between a and b minutes is 100,000 out of 150,000, which is 2/3. So, perhaps I should think in terms of the z-score that gives an area between -z and +z of 2/3. 

But in reality, the area between -z and +z is 2z - (for z>0), and this equals 2/3. So, 2z=5/3 → z=5/6≈0.8333. Wait, but that doesn't align with my earlier calculation. 

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. So, perhaps the area between -z and +z is 2z, where z is in standard deviations. So, to have 2z=2/3 → z=1/3≈0.3333. Then, the area from -0.3333 to +0.3333 is 2*(0.3333)=0.6666, which is 2/3. So, that's correct. 

So, in that case, the z-score is 0.3333, and the interval is [μ - z*σ, μ + z*σ] = [35 -0.3333*10, 35 +0.3333*10] = [35-3.333, 35+3.333] = [31.666, 38.333].

Looking at the options, option B is 31.5–41.7, option D is 4.5–5.5, etc. So, the closest is option B:31.5–41.7. Hmm, 31.5 is close to 31.666, and 41.7 is close to 41.666.

Wait, but the interval I calculated is 31.666–38.333. So, the closest option is B:31.5–41.7. So, perhaps the answer is option B.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the interval for 100,000 riders, which is 2/3 of the population, but perhaps the interval is for a different parameter. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the standard deviation as 10.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the z-score for 2/3 area.

Wait, in a standard normal distribution, the area between -z and +z is 2z, and we set 2z=2/3 → z=1/3≈0.3333.

So, the interval is [35 -0.3333*10, 35 +0.3333*10] = [35 -3.333, 35 +3.333] = [31.666,38.333].

So, looking at the options, the interval 31.5–41.7 is option B. So, perhaps the answer is option B.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the time interval associated with the first 100,000 riders, which is 31.5–41.7. So, perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the interval would be 25.3–39.3, but that was for a different problem. So, perhaps I should stick with option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem is about the first 100,000 riders, which is 2/3 of the total. So, the z-score for 2/3 area is 0.3333. So, the interval is [35 -0.3333*10, 35 +0.3333*10] = [31.666,38.333]. So, the closest option is B:31.5–41.7.

So, the answer should be option B.
</think>

The correct answer is **B: 31.5–41.7**.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time interval during which the first 100,000 riders waited.
   - This corresponds to 2/3 of the total riders.

2. **Z-score Calculation:**
   - For a normal distribution, the area between -z and +z is 2z.
   - We need 2z = 2/3 ⇒ z = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

3. **Interval Calculation:**
   - The mean waiting time is 35 minutes.
   - The interval is [35 - z*σ, 35 + z*σ].
   - σ = 10 minutes.
   - So, the interval is [35 - 0.3333*10, 35 + 0.3333*10] = [31.666, 38.333].

4. **Matching with Options:**
   - Option B: 31.5–41.7.
   - The closest match is **B: 31.5–41.7**.

**Answer:** **B: 31.5–41.7**
