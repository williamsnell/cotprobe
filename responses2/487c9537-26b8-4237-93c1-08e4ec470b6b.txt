Okay, so I've got this problem here about self-inductance. Hmm, I remember that in physics, inductance is related to the change in current and the induced electromotive force, or voltage. Oh wait, right! The formula is something like EMF equals inductance multiplied by the rate of change of current. So, EMF is V, L is inductance, and dI/dt is the rate of change of current.

The question says that the rate of change of current is 5 amperes per second, and the back emf (voltage) is 2 volts. So I can plug these into the formula. Let me write that down:

EMF = L * (dI/dt)

Given that EMF is 2 volts, and dI/dt is 5 A/s. So, 2 = L * 5. To find L, I just divide both sides by 5. That gives L = 2/5. Let me calculate that. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So L is 0.4 henry.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.4 henry. So that's the answer. Wait, but wait, did I get the formula right? Oh yeah, EMF is the induced voltage, which is L times the rate of change of current. Yep, that makes sense. So I think I did it right.

To calculate the self-inductance of a coil, we use the formula:

\[
\text{EMF} = L \cdot \frac{dI}{dt}
\]

where:
- EMF is the induced electromotive force (in volts),
- \( L \) is the self-inductance (in henry),
- \( \frac{dI}{dt} \) is the rate of change of current (in amperes per second).

Given:
- \( \text{EMF} = 2 \, \text{V} \),
- \( \frac{dI}{dt} = 5 \, \text{A/s} \),

we can rearrange the formula to solve for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{\text{EMF}}{\frac{dI}{dt}} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \, \text{henry}.
\]

Thus, the self-inductance of the coil is \( 0.4 \, \text{henry} \), which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
