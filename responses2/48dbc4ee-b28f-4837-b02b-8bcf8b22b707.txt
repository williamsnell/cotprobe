Question:

One of the two most common ingredients in medication designed for the relief of excess stomach acidity is aluminum hydroxide (Al (OH)_3, formula weight = 78 g/mole). If a patient suffering from a duodenal ulcer displays a hydrochloric acid (HCI, formula weight = 36.5 g/mole), concentration of 80 × 10^-3 M in his gastric juice and he produces 3 liters of gastric juice per day, how much medication containing 2.6 g Al(OH)_3 per 100 ml of solution must he consume per day to neutralize the acid?

Options:

A: 240 ml
B: 750 ml
C: 120 ml
D: 420 ml
E: 180 ml
F: 540 ml
G: 360 ml
H: 600 ml
I: 480 ml
J: 300 ml

Okay, so I've got this problem here about medication for stomach acid. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the amount of medication a person needs to consume daily to neutralize the stomach acid. 

First, let's read the question again. The medication is aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3. The formula weight is given as 78 g/mol. The patient has a stomach acid concentration of 80 mM (that's 80 x 10^-3 M) in his gastric juice. He produces 3 liters per day. We need to find out how much medication in grams per 100 ml he needs to take each day. Wait, no, the medication is given as 2.6 g per 100 ml solution. Hmm, wait, no, the question says, "how much medication containing 2.6 g Al(OH)3 per 100 ml of solution must he consume per day". So, they're talking about the concentration of the medication solution, not the concentration of the acid. Wait, that part is a bit confusing. Oh, right, the question is about how much of this solution (with that concentration) he needs to take each day to neutralize the acid.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read it again. The question says: "how much medication containing 2.6 g Al(OH)3 per 100 ml of solution must he consume per day to neutralize the acid?" Oh, so the medication is a solution of Al(OH)3 with a concentration of 2.6 grams per 100 ml. So, the person is ingesting this solution each day, and we need to find out how much of this solution (in grams) he needs to take each day to neutralize the acid in his stomach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the volume of this solution required to neutralize the acid. Let me think. 

The process would be:

1. Calculate the amount of HCl in the stomach juice per day.
2. Determine how much Al(OH)3 is needed to neutralize that HCl.
3. Find out how much of the 2.6 g/100ml solution provides that amount.

Wait, but the question says, "how much medication... must he consume per day." So, it's about the volume of the medication solution needed each day, not the mass. Because the medication is a solution, and the options are in ml, so probably they're asking for the volume.

But wait, let me parse the question again. It says, "how much medication containing 2.6 g Al(OH)3 per 100 ml of solution must he consume per day." So, this is the concentration of the solution. So, he needs to take a certain volume of this solution each day, which has a concentration of 2.6 g per 100 ml. So, the volume would be in ml, and each 100ml gives 2.6 grams of Al(OH)3.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's about the concentration of the medication solution, and how much of it is needed to neutralize the acid.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find out how much Al(OH)3 is needed per day, then see how much solution would be required to provide that amount, based on the concentration of the solution.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of HCl in the stomach juice per day.
2. Calculate the amount of Al(OH)3 needed to neutralize that HCl.
3. Find out how many grams of the medication solution (2.6 g per 100ml) are needed to provide that amount.
4. Convert that into the volume of solution (ml) needed each day.

Wait, but the answer options are in ml, so perhaps the correct approach is to find how much solution (in ml) must contain the required grams of Al(OH)3. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the amount of solution needed to neutralize all the acid in the 3 liters of juice. But the wording is "how much medication... must he consume per day," which suggests that he's taking this solution each day, and needs to take a certain volume each day to meet the requirement.

Hmm, perhaps the way to approach it is to calculate the normality of the acid solution and then figure out how much of the medication is needed. But I'm not sure. Let's try step by step.

First, compute the moles of HCl per day.

The concentration is 80 mM, which is 0.08 M. The volume per day is 3 liters. So, moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume = 0.08 mol/L * 3 L = 0.24 mol.

But wait, 0.08 M times 3 L is 0.24 moles of HCl.

Wait, but HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each molecule releases one H+.

Now, the reaction between Al(OH)3 and HCl: 

The balanced equation is Al(OH)3 + 3 HCl → AlCl3 + 3 H2O.

So, 1 mole of Al(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl.

Which means, the molar ratio is 1:3.

So, moles of Al(OH)3 = 0.24 mol HCl / 3 = 0.08 mol.

Now, the formula weight of Al(OH)3 is 78 g/mol. So, mass of Al(OH)3 needed = 0.08 mol *78 g/mol = 6.24 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, options are in 100ml increments. So, 6.24 grams is 62.4 grams per liter, which is 62.4 mg per ml. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Wait, 6.24 grams is for the solution. Wait, no, the problem says the medication contains 2.6 g per 100ml solution. So, perhaps the required amount is 6.24 grams of Al(OH)3, which is 62.4 grams per liter. But wait, the solution is 2.6 grams per 100ml, so per liter would be 26 grams.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says, "how much medication... must he consume per day to neutralize the acid?" The medication is 2.6 grams per 100ml of solution. So, that's the mass of Al(OH)3 per 100ml. So, the concentration is 2.6 g / 0.1 L = 26 g/L.

Because 2.6 g per 100ml is 2.6 g / 0.1 L = 26 g/L.

So, if each liter requires 6.24 grams of Al(OH)3, then the volume needed is (6.24 g) / (26 g/L) ) * 1000 mL/L = (6.24 /26) *1000 mL.

Wait, 6.24 /26 is 0.24. So 0.24 *1000 = 240 mL. So, 240 mL per day. Hmm, that's option A.

Wait, but wait, let me go through it again because I'm a bit confused about the steps.

So, step by step:

1. Calculate the total moles of HCl in 3 liters of 80 mM solution.

Concentration (M) = 0.08 M, volume (L) = 3 L. Moles HCl = 0.08 *3 = 0.24 mol.

2. The reaction is 1 mole Al(OH)3 : 3 moles HCl. So, required moles of Al(OH)3 = 0.24 /3 = 0.08 mol.

3. Moles of Al(OH)3 = 0.08 mol. Formula weight 78 g/mol. So, mass needed = 0.08 *78 = 6.24 grams.

4. The medication provides 2.6 g per 100ml (0.1 L). So, how much solution is needed to get 6.24 g?

The concentration is 26 g/L (since 2.6 g / 0.1 L =26 g/L). So, to get 6.24 g, how many liters?

Volume = mass / concentration =6.24 g /26 g/L = 0.24 L =240 mL. 

So, he needs 240 mL of the solution each day. That's option A.

To determine how much medication containing 2.6 g Al(OH)₃ per 100 mL of solution must be consumed per day to neutralize the acid in the stomach juice, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the moles of HCl in the stomach juice:**
   - The concentration of HCl is 80 mM (0.08 M), and the volume is 3 liters.
   - Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.08 mol/L × 3 L = 0.24 mol.

2. **Determine the moles of Al(OH)₃ required to neutralize the HCl:**
   - The balanced chemical equation for the neutralization reaction is: 
     \[
     \text{Al(OH)}_3 + 3 \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{AlCl}_3 + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O}.
     \]
   - From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Al(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of HCl.
   - Moles of Al(OH)₃ = \(\frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{3} = \frac{0.24 \, \text{mol}}{3} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}\).

3. **Calculate the mass of Al(OH)₃ required:**
   - The formula weight of Al(OH)₃ is 78 g/mol.
   - Mass of Al(OH)₃ = Moles × Formula Weight = 0.08 mol × 78 g/mol = 6.24 g.

4. **Relate the mass of Al(OH)₃ to the volume of the medication solution:**
   - The medication provides 2.6 g Al(OH)₃ per 100 mL of solution, which corresponds to 26 g/L.
   - Volume of medication needed = \(\frac{\text{Mass of Al(OH)}_3}{\text{Concentration of medication}} = \frac{6.24 \, \text{g}}{26 \, \text{g/L}} = 0.24 \, \text{L} = 240 \, \text{mL}\).

Thus, the patient must consume **240 mL** of the medication per day to neutralize the acid.
