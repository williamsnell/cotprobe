Okay, so I've got this question about statistics, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking about the smallest number of standard deviations from the mean needed to ensure that at least 50% of the data is covered. The options are A through J, with various numbers. 

Hmm, where do I start? I remember learning about the empirical rule, which relates to the spread of data around the mean. The empirical rule says that about 68% of data is within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. But wait, the question isn't about coverage of the entire interval; it's about covering a certain percentage of the data. So perhaps it's referring to a specific rule or formula.

Oh right, there's Chebyshev's inequality. I think that's the one. Chebyshev's theorem states that for any distribution, at least (1 - 1/k²) of the data lies within k standard deviations from the mean, where k is a positive integer greater than 1. So I need to find the smallest k such that 1 - 1/k² is at least 50%.

Setting up the inequality: 1 - 1/k² ≥ 0.5. Let's solve for k.

1 - 0.5 ≥ 1/k²  
0.5 ≥ 1/k²  
Which implies k² ≥ 2  
Taking square roots, k ≥ sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414. 

Since k must be an integer and greater than 1, the smallest integer greater than 1.414 is 2. So, k=2. Let me check: 1 - 1/4 = 0.75. That's 75%, which is more than 50%. So yes, 2 standard deviations would cover at least 75% of the data, which is more than enough for the 50% requirement.

Wait, but the question asks for the smallest number of standard deviations to ensure at least 50% coverage. So using Chebyshev's theorem with k=2 gives 75%, which satisfies the condition. But looking at the options, option E is 0.5, which doesn't make sense because standard deviations can't be less than 1. Oh wait, wait, no, zero isn't possible, but 0.5 is. Wait, no, Chebyshev's theorem requires k ≥ 1, but perhaps the smallest integer k that satisfies the condition is 2.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. What if I consider the tails? The tails beyond k standard deviations. The larger k is, the smaller the tail. So, for 50% coverage, perhaps the question is about the smallest k where the middle part is at least 50%. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the 50% of data that's within k and (k+1) standard deviations, but that's more complicated.

Wait, the question says "we must go" from the mean to cover at least 50% of the data. So if it's about the central part, not the tails, then Chebyshev's theorem is the way to go. If I'm using the inequality, for a given k, the proportion of data within k std. dev. is at least (1-1/k²). So for (1-1/k²) ≥ 0.5, which we found as k ≥ sqrt(2) ≈1.414. The next integer is 2.

So the smallest k is 2. So looking at the options, option D is 2.0. Therefore, the answer should be D.

The question asks for the smallest number of standard deviations needed to ensure at least 50% of the data is covered. Using Chebyshev's inequality, we set 1 - 1/k² ≥ 0.5, leading to k ≥ sqrt(2) ≈1.414. The smallest integer greater than this is 2. Thus, the correct option is D: 2.0.

Answer: D
