Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Taylor polynomial question. The problem is asking for the coefficient of the (x - 8)^2 term in the Taylor polynomial for y = x²/3 around x = 8. Hmm, I remember Taylor polynomials involve expanding a function around a specific point, and each term is based on the derivatives of the function at that point. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so I'll think it through.

First, I recall that the Taylor polynomial of order n around a point a is given by P_n(x) = f(a) + f’(a)(x - a) + f''(a)(x - a)^2/2! + ... + f^(n)(a)(x - a)^n/n!. So in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of (x - 8)^2, which would be f''(8)/2! because the general term for degree 2 is f''(a) (x - a)^2 / 2!.

So I need to find the second derivative of y = x²/3 and evaluate it at x=8. Let me write down the function: y = (x²)/3.

First derivative: dy/dx = (2x)/3.

Second derivative: d²y/dx² = 2/3.

Wait, but that's the second derivative. So f''(x) is 2/3, which is a constant. So evaluating at x=8 doesn't change it, it's still 2/3. 

Now, the coefficient for the (x - 8)^2 term is f''(8)/2! So that's (2/3) / 2. Let me compute that: 2 divided by 3 is 2/3. Divided by 2 is the same as multiplying by 1/2, so (2/3)*(1/2) = (2)/(3*2) = 1/3. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Is the formula correct? Because in Taylor series, the coefficient is f^(n)(a) multiplied by (x - a)^n divided by n! So for n=2, it's f''(a) / 2! Yes, that's correct. So 2/3 divided by 2 is indeed 1/3. 

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the coefficient should be 1/3, which is option C. 

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the function right? The function is y = x²/3. So yes, the second derivative is 2/3. So plugging in x=8, it's still 2/3. So the coefficient is (2/3) / (2) = 1/3. So the answer is C. 
</think>

The second derivative of y = x²/3 is 2/3, which is constant. Evaluating at x=8 gives 2/3. The coefficient for the (x - 8)^2 term is (2/3)/2! = (2/3)/(2) = 1/3. 

Answer: C
