Okay, so I've got this question about plant communities and their characteristics based on succession. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking which characteristic is predicted for an early-successional plant community. The options are A to J, each with a different characteristic.

First, I remember that succession refers to the process by which plants change their environment over time. Early succession implies that the process is still ongoing, not yet complete. So the community is still developing as the environment changes.

Let's go through each option:

A: High detrital biomass. Detritus is what's left after plants decompose. Early succession is about the plants adapting to new conditions, so perhaps detritus is low. So A is probably incorrect.

B: High number of predatory species. Early succession is about plants growing into their environment. Predators like herbivores would be in the area, but I'm not sure about the number. I think early communities might still have a mix, maybe fewer predators than later stages. So B might not be correct.

C: High presence of fully matured plant species. Early succession would involve less mature plants, as the process is ongoing. Once plants are fully mature, maybe the succession is complete, so C might not apply to early stages. So C is probably wrong.

D: High frequency of R-selected species. R-selected species are typically those that have a surplus of resources and can reproduce at a high rate. Early plants might be more competitive, so maybe they are R-selected. So D could be a possibility.

E: High rates of soil nutrient depletion. Early succession might require more decomposition, so maybe nutrients are lost. But I'm not sure about the rates; it depends. But I don't think that's a strong descriptor for early stages.

F: High diversity of plant species. Early succession would introduce new species because the environment is changing. So F seems plausible.

G: High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass. I'm not too familiar with this ratio. I think it might be more associated with how much of the plant's biomass is converted into food, but I'm not certain if this is a characteristic of early succession. Maybe it's more about how much they've developed, not the early stages.

H: High frequency of K-selected species. K-selected species are predators. Early succession may still have some predators, but the primary focus is on the climax stage, where the environment is stable. So H is probably incorrect.

I: Low rates of photosynthesis. That doesn't make much sense. Photosynthesis is a process that happens all the time, even in early stages. So I'm probably wrong.

J: High niche divergence among co-occurring species. When a community is developing, new species come in, each specializing in a different niche. So J sounds correct.

Wait, but let me think again. So the question is about early succession. Early succession is still developing, so the plant community has less mature species. So which options fit?

Looking at the options, J says high niche divergence. That makes sense because new species are emerging, each in their own way. So J would be a correct characteristic.

Option F, high diversity, is also correct, but the question is about which is predicted. Since early stages are still developing, the diversity is high, but perhaps more so than in climax stages.

But wait, another thought: High niche divergence is a key feature of early succession. As the environment changes, new species come to fill those gaps, leading to more specialized roles. So J is correct.

Also, F: high diversity. Even early stages have a lot of species, so F would also be correct. So which is the best answer?

The options are multiple choice, so perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

The question is asking for a characteristic predicted for early succession. So which of these is a hallmark of early succession.

J is about niche divergence, which is a feature of early succession. F is about diversity, which is also a feature. But the question is which is correctly predicted.

Wait, another thought: Early succession may have more species, but is it more variety? For example, early stages may have a lot of species because the environment is still changing, leading to new plant forms.

I think J is correct because early succession leads to high niche divergence, which is when each species has a unique role. This is a common feature.

Alternatively, F might be correct, but the question is about the 'characteristic' that is predicted. I have to choose between J and F.

Wait, the question is about which is predicted. So, looking for the correct feature.

Option J: High niche divergence—yes, that's a characteristic of early succession.

Option F: High diversity—also a correct point, but perhaps not the best descriptor for the process.

Wait, another angle: The process of succession. Early stages involve the introduction of new species, leading to more diversity. So F is correct, but J is also correct.

But the question is asking for which is a characteristic predicted for early succession. Both J and F seem correct.

Wait, let's think about what each option represents.

Option J: High niche divergence. Niche refers to the role a species plays in the community. Early succession introduces new species, each with their own niche, so J is correct.

Option F: High diversity. Early succession has a lot of species, so F is correct.

So the question is which is predicted, meaning which is a feature that is expected.

Wait, another possible point: Early succession could lead to a community that is low in detritus (so A is wrong). So, the question is about which is correct.

So which is correct? Both J and F. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is about what's predicted for early succession. Which is a correct feature.

Wait, the options are: J is about high niche divergence. That's a key feature of early succession, as the environment is still changing, leading to new species. So J is correct.

F is also correct, but perhaps the question is more about the development process.

Alternatively, the answer might be J.

Wait, another thought: High niche divergence is a key feature of early succession. So J is correct.

Alternatively, I remember that early succession leads to the development of specialized species, each in their own way, leading to high diversity. So F is correct. But which is the best answer?

Wait, perhaps the most correct answer is J. Let me see.

The options are:

A: High detrital biomass → No, as early stages have new plants.

B: High number of predatory → No, still have some, but not high.

C: Presence of matured plants → No, early stages are developing.

D: R-selected → Yes, since plants are developing into their environment.

E: High rates of nutrient depletion → Maybe, but not a sure characteristic.

F: High diversity → Yes, as early stages have many species.

G: Primary production to standing crop → Not sure.

H: K-selected → No.

I: Low photosynthesis? Not likely.

J: High niche divergence → Yes.

So, among options, both J and F are correct. But the question is, which is 'predicted' for early succession.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. Because the question is about early succession, which involves the introduction of new species, leading to high niche divergence.

Alternatively, the question might be looking for F, but perhaps J is a better answer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the characteristics of early succession.

Early succession leads to the introduction of new plant species, each specializing in a particular habitat or role. This leads to high diversity, which is F.

But niche divergence refers to each species having unique roles, which is a key feature of early succession. So both F and J are correct, but among the options, J is a more specific answer.

Wait, another thought: The primary focus of early succession is the development of new species. So the presence of high niche divergence (J) is a hallmark.

But the question is about which is predicted, so both J and F are correct. But the options only allow one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. Because high diversity is a characteristic, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps F is correct.

Wait, the question is about which is "predicted for an early-successional plant community?" So which is the correct descriptor.

Wait, another way: The early successional plant community has high diversity. That's F.

But for niche divergence, yes. So the question is which is a correct characteristic.

Wait, perhaps the best answer is J. High niche divergence is a correct feature of early succession.

So, the answer would be J.

Alternatively, the answer is F.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of some examples.

An early succession might have many species, each adapted to a specific part of the environment. So high diversity (F) is correct.

But niche divergence refers to the variety of roles each species plays. So J is correct.

Both F and J are correct, but which is one of the options.

Wait, the answer is J? Or F?

Wait, the question is about which is predicted for early succession. So both J and F are correct, but perhaps the best answer is J.

Wait, in the options, F is 'High diversity of plant species' and J is 'High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass'.

Hmm. Which is more specific?

Wait, perhaps the answer is J. Because the question is about the process of early succession, which involves the development and diversity of plant species. So J is a more direct descriptor of that process.

Alternatively, I'm probably overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option represents.

Option D: High frequency of R-selected. Early succession, perhaps includes some R-selected (e.g., plants that are competitive, so they might be R). So D is correct.

But the question is about which is the correct answer. So the question is, which is a correct feature. So the options are A to J.

Wait, perhaps I should think outside the box. The question is about the early succession, which would have low detrital (A is wrong), high diversity (F), and high niche divergence (J).

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both F and J, but the question expects only one option.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is F.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the textbook. Early succession leads to a community with high species diversity and high niche divergence. So both F and J are correct, but the question is which is correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and one is correct. So, perhaps both F and J are correct, but the question is which one is a 'characteristic' that is 'predicted' for early succession.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to think about the options and which is a known feature.

An early succession in a forest, for example, would have a high diversity of plant species, each specialized in their habitat. So F is correct.

Also, the process of early succession leads to high niche divergence, as new species emerge to fill the gaps. So J is correct.

So both are correct. But the options are a single answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the correct answer is J because it's a direct description of the process. So, the answer is J.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of early succession:

1. **Option A: High detrital biomass**  
   Early succession involves plants adapting to new environments, which typically results in lower detrital biomass as decomposition proceeds. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: High number of predatory species**  
   Early succession is characterized by a community of plants that may still include some predators, but this is not a hallmark of early succession itself. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: High presence of fully matured plant species**  
   Early succession is associated with the gradual introduction of new plant species, not fully matured ones. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: High frequency of R-selected species**  
   Early succession communities often include R-selected species, which are competitive and may include some that are R-selected. This option is correct.

5. **Option E: High rates of photosynthesis**  
   Photosynthesis is a continuous process that occurs even in early stages, so this option is incorrect.

6. **Option F: High diversity of plant species**  
   Early succession leads to a high diversity of plant species, as new species are introduced. This option is correct.

7. **Option G: High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass**  
   This ratio is more relevant to the climax stage, not the early stages, where primary production is still being converted into food. This option is incorrect.

8. **Option H: High frequency of K-selected species**  
   K-selected species are typically predators, and early succession is unlikely to involve K-selected species. This option is incorrect.

9. **Option I: Low rates of photosynthesis**  
   Photosynthesis is not low in early succession; it continues to occur. This option is incorrect.

10. **Option J: High niche divergence among co-occurring species**  
    Early succession is characterized by high niche divergence, as new species emerge to fill the gaps in the environment. This option is correct.

### Conclusion  
Both **F (High diversity of plant species)** and **J (High niche divergence)** are correct features of early succession. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **J** is the best descriptor of the process, as it directly refers to the gradual introduction of new species and their roles within the community.
