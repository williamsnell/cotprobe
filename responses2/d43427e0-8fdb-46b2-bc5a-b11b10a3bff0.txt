Question:

A landlord rented an apartment to a tenant for $250 per month in accordance with a month-to-month agreement. On September 3, the landlord mailed the following letter to the tenant:"September 2 In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby give you an option for 20 days from the above date to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, provided you pay two months' rent in advance. "The tenant received the letter on September 4, but did not read it until September 5. On September 23, the tenant telephoned the landlord and said, "I want to give you the $450 and sign the two-year lease as soon as possible. " The landlord replied, "I've change my mind. I do not want to sign a lease with you. Moreover, I want you to vacate the apartment immediately. " At no time after receiving the landlord's letter on September 4 did the tenant pay him the one-dollar consideration. Did the landlord's letter constitute an effective offer for a two-year lease?

Options:

A: No, because the landlord can retract the offer at any time before the tenant accepts.
B: No, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration.
C: Yes, because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent.
D: No, because the tenant did not immediately respond to the letter.
E: Yes, because the landlord cannot change their mind once an offer is made.
F: Yes, because consideration for the option can be infeffed from the previous month-to-month lease.
G: No, because the tenant did not pay the two months' rent in advance.
H: Yes, because the tenant expressed the intent to sign the lease within the specified timeframe.
I: No, because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease.
J: Yes, because the tenant has the right to accept the offer within the 20 days, regardless of the landlord's change of mind.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about whether a landlord's letter constitutes an effective offer for a two-year lease. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to think it through carefully.

First, the scenario: The tenant was renting an apartment for $250 per month. The landlord sent a letter on September 3 saying they're giving the tenant an option to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month. The tenant received the letter on September 4 but didn't read it until the 5th. Then, on September 23, the tenant calls the landlord and asks for $450 and to sign the lease immediately. The landlord responds that they don't want to sign and that the tenant wants to leave immediately. Importantly, the tenant didn't pay the $1 one-time consideration.

Now, the question is whether this letter is an effective offer. The options are A to J, each with different possible answers.

I remember that an offer in landlords' letters needs to meet certain criteria. Let's go through each point.

1. The letter must contain a specific promise or promise to enter into a contract. The letter here does mention giving the tenant an option to sign a lease. So point B says it's an offer if the tenant pays the one-dollar consideration. But in this case, the tenant didn't pay that. So B might not apply here because the consideration wasn't paid. Hmm, but wait, B says "unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration." Since the tenant didn't pay, maybe B is incorrect, but I'm not sure yet.

2. The letter must meet the conditions of a specific contract. I think it's about the specific terms—like, the offer must be specific, not vague, and must contain the promise to enter into a contract. The letter is quite specific—give the option for 20 days, at $225 per month, and provide the $1. So this should be specific enough. So I think this point is met.

3. The offer must be made without the tenant having the option to reject it immediately. In this case, the tenant did read the letter, but the landlord said they don't want to sign. The tenant's response was a prompt action, which might mean they refused to accept. But does that mean the offer became unacceptably unopted? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the key is whether the offer was made when it was made and if the tenant had a right to accept it. If the tenant reads the letter, even if they don't accept, does the letter still count as an offer?

Wait, but the letter was sent on September 3, and the tenant didn't read it until September 5. So the tenant's acceptance would require them to accept by September 23. But the tenant called on September 23 and was told to leave immediately. So the question is, did the letter constitute an offer despite the tenant not accepting? I think offers can be made when they are sent, regardless of whether the tenant accepts. But wait, another point: if the landlord can challenge the offer once it's made, but in this case, the offer was made before the tenant's call.

Wait, the question says that the landlord said they don't want to sign—so they didn't want to make the offer. So the letter was made without the tenant's acceptance. So the letter is an offer regardless of whether the tenant accepts. Because offers are made at the time the letter is sent. So the letter is an offer. So option I says yes because the tenant has the right to accept within 20 days, even if the landlord changes their mind. So that would make the letter an offer regardless of the tenant's response.

But wait, looking at the options again: option I says yes because the tenant has the right to accept within 20 days regardless of the landlord's change of mind. So the answer is I.

But wait, another point. The letter was sent on September 3, and the tenant read it until September 5. But the tenant didn't accept. So the letter was sent, but the tenant didn't accept. So the act of sending the letter was sufficient for the offer. So the letter is an offer.

Wait, but the problem is whether the letter is an offer when the tenant is allowed to accept. Because the letter is sent to the tenant, and the offer is made. The tenant may not accept, but the letter is still an offer because the offer is made at the time of sending. So yes, it's an offer.

So the letter is an offer because it was made on time, and the conditions were specific. The fact that the tenant didn't accept it doesn't make it unofferable. So the correct answer would be I. So the letter is an offer because it meets the criteria of being made without the tenant having the option to reject it immediately, and it's specific.

Wait, but another point: does the letter contain a condition precedent to the execution of the lease? The letter says, "provided you pay two months' rent in advance." So the tenant must pay upfront. But the tenant didn't pay that (they only paid the $1). So the condition is not met. So the letter is not a condition precedent. So the letter is an offer, but it also has a condition that the tenant must pay upfront. However, the question is about whether the letter itself is an effective offer, not about the condition. So if the letter was made and is specific, it's an offer; the condition is separate.

So I think I is correct. The letter is an offer because it was made on time and is specific, regardless of the tenant's response. So the answer is I.

The letter sent to the tenant on September 3 met the criteria for an offer. It was made on time, contained specific terms, and was specific enough for the tenant to accept or reject. The fact that the tenant did not accept the offer does not negate the offer because offers are made at the time of mailing. Therefore, the landlord's letter constituted an effective offer.

Answer: I
