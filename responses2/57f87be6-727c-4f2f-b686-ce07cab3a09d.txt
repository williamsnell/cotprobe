Question:

A 24-year-old recent college graduate comes to the office because of a 3-year history of increased frequency of urination and occasional incontinence whenever she travels. She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly "panicky." She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Recommend a diet change
B: Suggest a neurological examination
C: Recommend behavioral therapy
D: Review the patient's sexual history
E: Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem
F: Recommend a urinary incontinence medication
G: Recommend a physical therapy
H: Advise the patient to stop taking oral contraceptives
I: Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy

Okay, so I've got this question about a patient with a urinary issue and she's a 24-year-old college graduate. Let me try to break this down. The patient's symptoms are recurrent urination, incontinence, and they're traveling frequently. She's anxious about flying and panicky, which might make her seem stressed. Her medical history isn't exceptional, so no other issues like diabetes or hypertension are present.

She's been having similar mild symptoms before when she was a student. Her only medication is oral contraceptive, but that's probably not relevant here. The physical exam shows no abnormalities, so nothing else wrong with the body.

The options are about what next steps to take. Let's go through each possible answer.

Option A: Diet change. Well, she's stressed and anxious, but stress from travel might be a symptom, but the question is about the cause. Also, dietary changes could help, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate next step.

Option B: neurological exam. She's having urinary issues, which are often related to the urinary system, but a neurological exam could detect something like a urinary tract obstruction or another condition. I'm not sure if that's the first step, though. The question says she's been experiencing symptoms a few days before she flies, so maybe the cause is something else.

Option C: Behavioral therapy. That's more about treatment methods, but without knowing the underlying cause, behavioral therapy might not be the next step. It's more about how she's coping, not necessarily solving her urinary issue.

Option D: Review sexual history. She's a college graduate, so her sexual history might be important. She's had mild symptoms before, so maybe she had an infection or another condition that's related. That makes sense. If she had a yeast infection before, for example, that could explain the recurrent symptoms.

Option E: Avoid stressful activities. Her anxiety about flying might be her only stressor. But if she's stressed, avoiding stressful activities could help manage it. But again, without knowing the underlying cause, this might not be the first step.

Option F: Urinary medication. She's on an oral contraceptive, but that's probably not directly related to her symptoms. Urinary medications are for conditions like Pelvic issues, which she doesn't seem to have.

Option G: Physical therapy. That would be for a chronic condition, but again, without knowing the cause, this isn't the first step. Physical therapy is for when the problem is physical, like a chronic illness.

Option H: Psychodynamic psychotherapy. That's more about psychological constructs, which might not be the next step here. She's not struggling with anxiety or mood disorders.

So, the next step would be to look at her sexual history because if she had a yeast infection or another condition related to the symptoms, that would explain the recurrent urinary issues. Since her medical history is unremarkable, it's possible that something else is at play.

The patient's symptoms are related to the urinary tract, and since she's anxious, maybe she has a urinary tract infection. So, reviewing her sexual history could help find that.

Looking back at the options, D is the best fit. So the answer should be D.

The patient is a 24-year-old college graduate with recurrent urination and incontinence symptoms, which could indicate a urinary tract obstruction or another related condition. Her anxiety about traveling and mild symptoms prior to graduation suggest there might be an underlying condition, such as a yeast infection or another urinary tract issue. The sexual history is unremarkable, so reviewing her sexual history would be the most appropriate next step to identify the cause.

**Answer: D**
