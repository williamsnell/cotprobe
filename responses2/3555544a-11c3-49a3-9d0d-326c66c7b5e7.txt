Okay, so I'm trying to solve this economics question about marginal products and firm decisions. Let me see what the question is. It says that the price of labor is $2 and capital is $1. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is 200, and the marginal product of capital (MPK) is 50. Then it asks what the firm should do based on these numbers.

Hmm, I remember that a firm will choose the combination of inputs (labor and capital) where the last unit of money spent on each input gives the same marginal productivity. Oh wait, the rule is that the ratio of the marginal products should equal the ratio of input prices. So, MPL / MPK should equal the wage rate (W) divided by the rental rate (R). 

Wait, the formula is MPL / MPK = W / R. So let me plug in the numbers. MPL is 200, MPK is 50. So MPL/MPK is 200/50 = 4. The wage rate W is $2, and rental rate R is $1. So W/R is 2/1 = 2. Wait, 4 doesn't equal 2. That means the firm is not currently at the optimal input mix.

So, the idea is that if MPL/MPK > W/R, it's cheaper to invest in labor. Because each unit of capital gives 200/50 =4 units of MPL, while each unit of labor gives 2/1 = 2. So since 4>2, capital is more efficient in terms of productivity per dollar. So the firm should use more labor and less capital.

Wait, but the question is asking what the firm should do. It gives options about whether to increase or decrease labor and capital. So the correct decision is to decrease capital and increase labor.

Looking at the options, let me check each one. 

Option A: Decrease capital and increase labor. That makes sense because capital is less efficient. Wait, no, because MPK is lower than MPL. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The optimal condition is when the ratio of MPL to MPK equals the ratio of W to R. So, if MPL/MPK is higher than W/R, that means each dollar spent on capital gives a better return than labor. So the firm should allocate more to labor and less to capital.

So in this case, since 4 (MPL/MPK) > 2 (W/R), the firm should increase labor and decrease capital. So the correct option is E or H? Let me look.

Option E says: Decrease both labor and capital so that the marginal product of capital and labor falls. No, that's not right because decreasing capital would cause MPK to fall, but increasing labor would cause MPL to rise.

Wait, but the correct action is to increase labor and decrease capital. So looking at the options, which one says that?

Option A: Decrease capital and increase labor. So that would be increasing labor because capital is being decreased. That's the correct scenario.

Wait, let me see each option's statement.

Option A: Decrease capital and increase labor. That's the scenario I'm thinking of, because capital is less efficient. So the firm should use more labor and less capital.

Option B: Increase capital and decrease labor. No, that's the opposite of what's needed.

Option C: Increase both. No, that's wrong.

Option D: Increase labor and keep capital same. But if keeping capital same would not satisfy the condition. Because if MPK is 50, and if labor is increased, MPL would increase. But does that help? Let's see, the ratio would be 200/50=4, which is greater than W/R=2. So changing capital would have to be in the right way.

Wait, but what if the firm increases labor and leaves capital the same? Let's see: If they don't change capital, MPK remains 50. The new ratio would be 200 /50=4. W/R is 2. So 4>2, meaning the firm would still prefer to increase labor further. So if they increase labor, the ratio would be higher; they would want to keep increasing until the ratio equals W/R.

So if the firm increases labor and decreases capital, that would bring the ratio down towards W/R.

So option E says: Decrease both, which would actually make MPK lower and MPL higher. But this is not the correct action because it's not a choice between reducing both; that would require a different approach.

Wait, but the correct action is to increase labor and decrease capital. So looking at the options, option A says: Decrease capital and increase labor. That's correct.

Option H says: Decrease capital and increase labor, so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls. Wait, no, that's the opposite of what's needed. Because if you increase labor, MPL should rise, and if you decrease capital, MPK should fall.

So the correct option is A. Let me check the other options.

Option H's reasoning is that if you decrease capital and increase labor, MPL increases and MPK increases. Wait, no, because MPK was 50 before. If you decrease capital, MPK would decrease, not increase. So option H's reasoning is wrong.

So the correct choice is option A: Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.

Alternatively, another way to think: When the firm has a higher MPL per dollar than MPK per dollar, it's better to use more labor. Because each dollar spent on labor gives a higher return than capital. So the firm should increase labor and reduce capital.

So answer is option A.
</think>

The firm should increase labor and decrease capital because the marginal product of labor (MPL) is higher than the marginal product of capital (MPK). Specifically, MPL/MPK = 200/50 = 4, while the wage rate (W) divided by the rental rate (R) is 2/1 = 2. Since 4 > 2, the firm is currently using capital more efficiently than labor. To achieve the optimal input mix, the firm should allocate more resources to labor and less to capital. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Decrease capital and increase labor. This aligns with the correct decision, as it aligns with the rule that capital should be used less and labor more to equalize the marginal productivity per dollar spent.
- **Option B**: Increase capital and decrease labor. This is incorrect because it contradicts the optimal condition.
- **Option C**: Increase both labor and capital. This would not align with the optimal condition, as it would worsen the situation.
- **Option D**: Increase labor and keep capital constant. While this increases MPL, it does not decrease MPK, and the firm would need to further increase labor to bring MPK down to match the optimal ratio.
- **Option E**: Decrease both labor and capital. This is incorrect because it reduces both inputs, which is not efficient.
- **Option H**: Decrease capital and increase labor, causing MPK to rise and MPL to fall. This is incorrect because both MPK and MPL should decrease when capital is reduced and labor is increased.
- **Option G**: Keep labor constant and increase capital. This is incorrect because it increases MPK and lowers MPL.
- **Option F**: Keep labor constant and decrease capital. This is incorrect because it lowers MPK and raises MPL.
- **Option I**: Decrease labor and increase capital. This is incorrect because it lowers MPL and raises MPK, which would worsen the situation.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it reflects the optimal decision to allocate more resources to labor and less to capital.
