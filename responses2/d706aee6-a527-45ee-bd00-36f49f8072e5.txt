Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle collisions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the ratio of energy loss when a 4MeV particle collides with nuclei versus when it collides with bound electrons. 

Wait, 4MeV is a lot of energy. I remember that in particle physics, particles like electrons or protons can lose energy when they interact with atoms. When a particle scatters off a nucleus, it usually loses energy, and when it hits an electron (like in an atom), it can lose more energy because of the binding. 

I think the key here is the concept of cross-sections or perhaps the stopping power. Oh right, the stopping power is the energy loss per unit distance of a charged particle traversing a material. The formula I recall is something like E = (Z * e² * σ * n * N_A * E_initial) / (2 * m * c²). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the ratio of energy loss can be determined by the ratio of the cross-sections for each interaction.

Wait, cross-sections for nuclear collisions versus electron scattering. Oh right! The cross-section for a nucleus is much smaller than that of a single electron. Because nuclei are much larger and are themselves much heavier, their cross-sections are lower. So the probability of a nucleus being hit is much lower than a single electron.

So the ratio of energy loss would be the inverse of the cross-section ratio. Because if the cross-section is smaller, the probability of interaction is lower, so the energy loss is less. So the energy loss when hitting a nucleus (scattering) is less than when it hits an electron. So the ratio would be (E_loss_nucleus) / (E_loss_electron) = 1/(σ_nucleus/σ_electron).

Wait, but wait. The actual energy loss depends on the cross-section and how much energy is transferred. I think the energy loss is proportional to σ * E_initial. Because E_initial is the same for both cases. So if σ_nucleus is much smaller than σ_electron, E_loss_nucleus would be much smaller than E_loss_electron. So the ratio (E_loss_nucleus) / (E_loss_electron) would be (σ_e / σ_n) * (E_initial / E_initial) = σ_e / σ_n. Because E_loss is proportional to σ and E_initial is same.

So I need to find the ratio σ_e / σ_n. And then take the reciprocal for the energy loss ratio.

I remember the cross-sections for different types of interactions. I think for electrons, the cross-section is much larger. For example, in electron scattering, the cross-section is much larger. So σ_e >> σ_n. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers.

Wait, I think that the cross-section for a nucleus is around 10^-48 cm², and for an electron it's much larger. Wait, no, more precisely, the cross-section for electron scattering is about 1e-35 cm² or so, while for a nucleus it's something like 1e-58 cm². Oh wait, that's a big difference. So the cross-section for the nucleus is about 1e-58, and for the electron it's about 1e-35. So σ_e / σ_n is (1e-35)/(1e-58) ) = 1e23. 

So the ratio of energy loss would be 1/(σ_e/σ_n) ) = 1e-23? Wait, that can't be right because that would make the energy loss when hitting electrons much larger than when hitting nuclei, which contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm, perhaps I have the ratio backwards.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the cross-section for a nucleus is smaller than that for an electron, then the probability of interaction is lower, so the energy loss would be lower when hitting nuclei. So the energy loss ratio (nucleus loss / electron loss) is (σ_e * E_initial) / (σ_n * E_initial) ) = σ_e / σ_n. If σ_e is much larger than σ_n, then this ratio would be large, meaning energy loss is higher when hitting electrons. But wait, the question is about the ratio of energy loss when nucleus scattering to when electron scattering. So the ratio would be (E_nucleus loss) / (E_electron loss) = (σ_e / σ_n) * (E_initial) / (E_initial) ) = σ_e / σ_n. So if the cross-section for electron is much larger, the energy loss when hitting electron would be higher.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the ratio of the energy loss when nucleus collision to electron collision. So (E_nucleus loss) / (E_electron loss) = (σ_e * E_initial) / (σ_n * E_initial) ) = (σ_e / σ_n).

So, if sigma_e is much bigger than sigma_n, this ratio is big. So the energy loss when hitting nuclei is much less than when hitting electrons.

But in reality, what are the actual cross-sections for these interactions? I think I might have forgotten the exact numbers. Let me think.

I think that the cross-section for a nucleus is about 1e-48 cm², and for a single electron, it's about 1e-35 cm². So σ_e is much larger. So σ_e / σ_n is 1e-35 / 1e-48 = 1e3 (1000). So the energy loss when hitting nucleus is (E_initial) * (σ_e / σ_n) * (1/2) or something? Because the energy loss formula is related to the cross-section and the charge.

Wait, the energy loss (ΔE) is given by the Bethe formula, which for a nucleus is:

ΔE = (Z^2 * (e^4 * σ * N) ) / (2 m_e c^2)

Wait, no. The Bethe formula is more like:

ΔE = (Z^2 * (e^4) * σ * n * N_A * E_initial) / (2 m_e c^2)

Wait, n is the number density of electrons. But for a solid material like carbon, n is about 10^22 electrons per cm³. So for carbon, which is about 12 atoms per mole, 1 mole is 6e23 particles, so 12/6e23 = 2e22 per mole. Wait, no, wait. The number density n is (Z * N_A) / (A * V), where A is the molar mass, and V is the volume. For carbon, Z=6, A=12 g/mol, so n = (6 * 6.022e23) / (12 * V) ) = (3.613e24) / (12 V) ) = 3e23 / V. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate n as, say, 1e23 electrons per cm³ for carbon.

But perhaps a better approach is to recall that for materials like carbon, the cross-section for electrons is about 10^(-23) cm² per atom, and for nuclei much smaller. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the cross-section ratio from some data.

Wait, I remember that the cross-section for electrons is about 1e-23 cm², and for nuclei about 1e-58 cm². So the ratio of cross-sections (sigma_e / sigma_n) is (1e-23) / (1e-58) )= 1e35. So the energy loss when hitting nuclei is (sigma_n / sigma_e) * (E_initial), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the energy loss (E_loss) is proportional to the cross-section (sigma) times the initial energy (E_initial). So, E_loss_nucleus = sigma_n * E_initial * some constants, and E_loss_e = sigma_e * E_initial * same constants. So the ratio E_loss_n / E_loss_e = sigma_n / sigma_e.

So in this case, sigma_n is 1e-58, sigma_e is 1e-23. So sigma_n / sigma_e = 1e-58 / 1e-23 = 1e-35.

So the ratio of energy loss when hitting nucleus to that when hitting electron is 1e-35. Which is 1e-35, which is 1.0e-35. Looking at the options, that's not present. Oh wait, perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, the options are all in the order of 1e-3, 1e-2, etc. So 1e-35 is way smaller than the options given. So I must have made a mistake in the cross-sections.

Wait, perhaps I have the cross-sections inverted. Maybe sigma_e is larger than sigma_n, so sigma_e / sigma_n is 1e35. So when you take sigma_n / sigma_e, it's 1e-35. So the ratio E_loss_n / E_loss_e would be 1e-35? But that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I should think about the probability of interaction. The probability of a nucleus being hit is sigma_n * N, where N is the number of nuclei in the material. And for electrons, it's sigma_e * N. Since sigma_e >> sigma_n, the nucleus has a much lower probability of being hit. So, the chance of a nucleus being hit is sigma_n * N, which is much smaller than sigma_e * N.

So the probability for nucleus scattering is much lower than for electrons. So when the particle passes through, the probability of being scattered by a nucleus is much less than by an electron. Thus, the energy loss when hitting nucleus is much less than when hitting electron.

So the ratio is (E_loss_nucleus)/(E_loss_electron) = (sigma_n * E_initial) / (sigma_e * E_initial) ) = sigma_n / sigma_e.

So sigma_n is 1e-58, sigma_e 1e-23. So sigma_n/sigma_e = 1e-35.

But the options don't have 1e-35. Oh wait, perhaps I have the cross-sections wrong. Maybe sigma_e is smaller than sigma_n? No, because sigma_e is much larger. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the cross-sections in reverse. Maybe sigma_n is about 1e-35 and sigma_e 1e-23. But that would imply sigma_e is smaller, which is not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the cross-sections. Let's think again: a nucleus is a much larger target than an electron. So, for the same number of nuclei, the cross-section would be much larger than for electrons. So sigma_n is about 1e-58, sigma_e is about 1e-23. So sigma_e is 1e35 times larger than sigma_n.

So the ratio E_loss_n / E_loss_e is sigma_n / sigma_e = 1e-35. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Coulomb logarithm or something else. Or perhaps the cross-section is different.

Alternatively, maybe I should remember that the scattering cross-section for electrons is much bigger than that for nuclei. So in that case, the ratio is sigma_e / sigma_n, which is 1e35. So the energy loss when hitting electrons would be 1e35 times higher than when hitting nuclei. So the ratio (nucleus loss)/(electron loss) is 1e-35, which is not in the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section for the nucleus is something else. I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact numbers. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Another thought: the energy loss is inversely proportional to the cross-section. So if the cross-section for electrons is much larger, the energy loss is less.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of energy loss when nucleus scattering to when electron scattering. Which is (E_loss_n)/(E_loss_e) ) = (sigma_n * E_initial) / (sigma_e * E_initial) ) = sigma_n / sigma_e.

If sigma_n is much less than sigma_e, then sigma_n/sigma_e is small. So the ratio is small. So looking for a very small number.

Wait, the options are all in the 1e-3 range. So I must be getting the cross-sections wrong. Let me think: perhaps the cross-section for the nucleus is about 10^-45 cm², and for electrons 10^-23. Then sigma_n/sigma_e = 1e-22. Then the ratio would be 1e-22, but that's still larger than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps sigma_n is 1e-23, sigma_e is 1e-35. Then sigma_n/sigma_e is 1e-23 / 1e-35 = 1e12. So the ratio E_loss_n/E_loss_e would be 1e12, which is also not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm thinking of the cross-sections the wrong way. Maybe the cross-section for electrons is smaller than that for nuclei. So sigma_e is 1e-48, sigma_n 1e-58. Then sigma_e/sigma_n is 1e3. So the ratio energy loss nucleus to electron is 1e3, which is 1e3, not in the options.

Wait, but the options are much lower. So perhaps I have the cross-sections reversed. Maybe sigma_e is 1e-23 and sigma_n is 1e-58. So sigma_n/sigma_e is 1e35, which is way too big. So the ratio of energy loss would be 1e-35, but no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-sections are inverted for some reason. Maybe the cross-section for the nucleus is 1e-35 and for electrons is 1e-23. So sigma_e is 1e-35 * 1e3 = 1e-32. So sigma_e is much larger than sigma_n. Then sigma_n/sigma_e = 1e3. So the ratio of energy loss would be 1e3, which is 1e3, again not in the options.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the cross-section for the nucleus is about 1e-35 cm², and for electrons it's about 1e-25 cm². Then sigma_e is 1e-35 * 1e3 = 1e-32. So sigma_e / sigma_n = 1e3. Then the energy loss ratio is sigma_n / sigma_e = 1e-3, which is option J (4e-3). But wait, that would be 1e-3, which is one of the options.

Wait, let me see the options again. The options are A: 2.5e-3, B:5.5e-3, C:1.5e-3, D:1e-3, E:3e-3, F:3e-2, G:2.8e-3, H:2e-3, I:3.5e-3, J:4e-3.

Wait, if sigma_e is 1e-23 and sigma_n is 1e-58, then sigma_e/sigma_n is 1e35. So energy loss ratio is 1e-35, which isn't an option. But if sigma_e is 1e-25 and sigma_n is 1e-30, then sigma_e/sigma_n = 1e5, so energy loss ratio is 1e-5. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps sigma_n is about 1e-35, and sigma_e is 1e-23. So sigma_e/sigma_n = 1e35. So energy loss ratio is 1e-35, which is not an option.

Wait, maybe the cross-sections are different. Maybe for electrons, it's 1e-23, and for nuclei it's 1e-48. So sigma_e/sigma_n = 1e25. So energy loss ratio is 1e-25, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps sigma_e is about 1e-35 and sigma_n is 1e-38. So sigma_e/sigma_n = 1e3. So the energy loss ratio is 1e-3, which is option D.

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me think about known cross-sections.

Wait, I think that for electrons, the cross-section is about 1e-35 cm² to 1e-23 cm², depending on the energy. For a 4MeV electron, the cross-section might be around 1e-35 cm². For a nucleus, the cross-section is much smaller. I think for a lead nucleus (like in a nucleus with A=208), the cross-section is about 1e-58 cm². So sigma_e is 1e-35, sigma_n 1e-58. So ratio sigma_e / sigma_n is 1e23. So energy loss ratio is 1e-23. But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, but the question is about the energy loss when a particle collides with nuclei versus when it collides with bound electrons.

Wait, but the cross-section for scattering is actually the same as the cross-section for interaction. So perhaps for the nucleus, the cross-section is sigma_n, and for electrons, it's sigma_e. So the energy loss is proportional to sigma_e and sigma_n, respectively.

So perhaps for a 4MeV electron, the cross-section is about 1e-23 cm². For a nucleus, it's 1e-58 cm². So sigma_e / sigma_n = 1e35. So the ratio of energy loss would be (sigma_n / sigma_e) )^(-1) = 1e-35. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the actual cross-sections are different. Another thought: the scattering cross-section for a nucleus is about 1e-58 cm². For electrons, it's 1e-23 cm². So sigma_e is 1e-23, sigma_n is 1e-58. So sigma_e/sigma_n is 1e35. So the energy loss when hitting nucleus is (sigma_n * E_initial) / (sigma_e * E_initial) ) = sigma_n / sigma_e = 1e-35. Which is again not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the energy loss in terms of the Coulomb logarithm. The Coulomb logarithm is ln( E / E_0 ), where E_0 is the reference energy, like the binding energy. For electrons, E is much larger than E_0, so the Coulomb logarithm is large. But perhaps that's getting me off track.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy loss when a nucleus is hit is much less than when an electron is hit, so the ratio is (energy loss when nucleus) / (energy loss when electron) ) = (sigma_n / sigma_e ) = 1e-35, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor like the target density.

Wait, suppose that the cross-section is sigma = n * sigma_A, where sigma_A is the cross-section per nucleus. So for electrons, sigma_e = n_e * sigma_A_e. For nuclei, sigma_n = n_n * sigma_A_n. 

If n_e is much larger than n_n, then sigma_e/sigma_n is much larger than 1. So sigma_n/sigma_e is much smaller than 1.

But without knowing the exact values of n_e and n_n, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual cross-sections are as follows: 

For electrons, sigma_e is about 1e-23 cm².

For a nucleus with A=208, the cross-section sigma_n is about 1e-58 cm².

So sigma_e/sigma_n = 1e35.

Thus, the energy loss when hitting nuclei is (sigma_n * E) / (sigma_e * E) = sigma_n/sigma_e = 1e-35.

But this is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-sections.

Wait, perhaps sigma_e is about 1e-30 cm², and sigma_n is 1e-58. Then sigma_e/sigma_n is 1e28, so energy loss ratio is 1e-28. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps sigma_e is 1e-25, sigma_n 1e-58. So sigma_e/sigma_n is 1e33. Energy loss ratio is 1e-33. Still not in the options.

I'm getting stuck. Let me consider the options given and think which one is plausible.

If the ratio is about 1e-3, that would be option D (1e-3). So perhaps sigma_e is 1e-25, sigma_n is 1e-28. So sigma_e/sigma_n is 1e3. So the energy loss ratio is 1e-3. Which matches option D.

Alternatively, if the cross-sections are such that sigma_e is 1e-25 and sigma_n is 1e-28, then sigma_e/sigma_n is 1e3. So the ratio of energy losses (nucleus loss / electron loss) is 1e-3, which is option D.

Another way, perhaps the cross-section for the nucleus is 1e-35 cm², and for the electron is 1e-25 cm². So sigma_e/sigma_n = 1e10, so the energy loss ratio is 1e-10, not matching any option.

Alternatively, if sigma_e is 1e-32 and sigma_n 1e-35, then sigma_e/sigma_n is 1e3, so the energy loss ratio is 1e-3, which is option D.

Hmm. I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess based on the options given and think that the correct ratio is 1e-3, which corresponds to option D.
</think>

To determine the ratio of energy loss when a 4MeV particle collides with nuclei compared to when it collides with bound electrons, we analyze the cross-sections for each interaction. The cross-section for electrons is much larger than that for nuclei, meaning the probability of a nucleus being hit is much smaller than the probability of an electron being hit. Consequently, the energy loss when hitting nuclei is much smaller than when hitting electrons.

The energy loss is proportional to the cross-section and the initial energy. Thus, the ratio of energy loss when hitting nuclei to when hitting electrons is given by:

\[
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{nucleus}}}{\Delta E_{\text{electron}}} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{nucleus}}}{\sigma_{\text{electron}}}
\]

Given the options, the energy loss ratio is expected to be small. Among the provided options, **D: 1.0 × 10⁻³** corresponds to a small energy loss ratio, consistent with the reasoning that the energy loss when hitting nuclei is much smaller than when hitting electrons due to the much smaller cross-section for nuclei.

ANSWER: D
