Okay, so I need to figure out the state where the movie Magnolia was set. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the movies off the top of my head, but I'll try to think through this. 

Wait, Magnolia sounds familiar. I remember it's a film, but I'm not sure of the exact place. Let me think. If I recall correctly, Magnolia is set in the 1990s and was directed by someone, maybe a well-known director. I think it's directed by John L. Smith or something like that. 

Now, I'm trying to remember the locations. I think it might be in California. I'm pretty sure that Magnolia is set there because I've heard it mentioned in the context of a movie series or a TV series. Oh yeah, I think Magnolia is set in Los Angeles, but wait, no, that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again. The options are states, not cities. So I'm looking for a state where the movie was set.

Wait, I'm getting confused. If the movie was set in Los Angeles, which is a city, but the options are states, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, Magnolia is set in California. I think the movie was released in California. Or was it set in a specific part of California? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, California is option E. So maybe the movie was set in California. I've heard of the movie "Magnolia" being a film that's part of a TV series, but I'm not certain about the exact location. Alternatively, maybe it's set in a specific state within California, but the options don't specify cities. So the answer must be California as the state where it's set.
