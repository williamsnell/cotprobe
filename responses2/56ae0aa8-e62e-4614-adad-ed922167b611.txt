Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about sound echoes. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says that a sound is returned as an echo from a cliff after 4 seconds, and I need to find out how far the cliff is. Oh wait, but wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about two different echoes. It just says the same thing twice. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed as if it's a single echo.

Alright, so the formula for sound travel time. I remember that the time it takes for a sound to travel a distance is given by time = distance / speed. So, if the sound takes 4 seconds to go to the cliff and come back, that's a round trip. So the total distance the sound travels is twice the distance to the cliff.

The velocity of sound in air is given as 1100 feet per second. So, let's compute the total distance first. Time is 4 seconds, so total distance is velocity multiplied by time. Let me calculate that: 1100 ft/s * 4 s = 4400 feet. That's the round trip distance.

But wait, the cliff is only half that distance away, right? Because the sound has to go to the cliff and come back. So the actual distance to the cliff is half of 4400 feet. Let me do the math: 4400 / 2 = 2200 feet. So the cliff is 2200 feet away.

Looking at the options, option I is 2200 ft. So the correct answer should be I.

The sound travels to the cliff and back, making the total distance twice the actual distance. Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), the total distance is \( 1100 \, \text{ft/s} \times 4 \, \text{s} = 4400 \, \text{ft} \). Dividing by 2 gives the distance to the cliff as \( 2200 \, \text{ft} \). 

Answer: I: 2200 ft
