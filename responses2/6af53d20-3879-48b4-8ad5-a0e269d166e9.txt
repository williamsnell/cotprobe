Okay, so I have this problem here about the moons of Saturn and Kepler's third law. Hmm, I remember Kepler's laws relate the orbital period of a planet or moon to its distance from the center of the parent body. Oh wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius, right? Or was it the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, more precisely, for planets, it's T² proportional to R³. But this applies to any orbit around a central mass, I think. So since both Titan and Hyperion are orbiting Saturn, I should apply the same law.

The problem gives me Titan's data: mean orbital radius is 1.22e9 meters and the period is 15.95 days. Hyperion's radius is 1.48e9 m. I need to find its period.

So the formula is T² = (4π²/GM) * R³. But since both are around Saturn, the mass M is the same. So the ratio of their periods squared to their radii cubed should be the same. So (T1²)/(T2²) = (R1³)/(R2³)

Wait, wait, no. Kepler's law in the form T² ∝ R³. So T1² / T2² = R1³ / R2³. That's correct.

So R1 is 1.22e9, R2 is 1.48e9.

Let me compute the ratio of R1³ to R2³. R1 is 1.22e9, R2 is 1.48e9. So R1/R2 is (1.22)/(1.48) ≈ 0.8276.

Then R1³/R2³ is (0.8276)^3. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 0.8276 cubed. 0.8276^2 is about 0.685. Then multiply by 0.8276 again: 0.685 * 0.8276 ≈ 0.566.

So R1³/R2³ ≈ 0.566. So (T1²)/(T2²) = 0.566. Taking the square root of both sides, T1/T2 = sqrt(0.566) ≈ 0.752.

Wait, T1 is 15.95 days. So T2 = T1 / 0.752. Let me compute that. 15.95 / 0.752 ≈ let's see, 16 / 0.75 is about 21.33 (since 0.75 * 21.33 = 16). So 15.95 / 0.752 ≈ 21.2 days.

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 21.3 days. So that's likely the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Compute R1^3 / R2^3: (1.22/1.48)^3. Let me compute 1.22 / 1.48. Let me divide 1.22 by 1.48. 

1.48 goes into 1.22 zero times. So 0.8276 times (as before, 1.22 * 1000 = 1220, 148 * 8 is 1184, 1220-1184=36, bring down a zero: 360. 148 *2=296 → 76, bring down zero: 760. 148*5=740, remainder 20. So 0.8276 approximately.

So cube that: 0.8276^3.

0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.8276 is slightly higher. Let me compute (0.8276)^3. Let me compute (0.8 + 0.0276)^3.

Using the binomial expansion: a^3 + 3a^2 b + 3 a b^2 + b^3, where a=0.8, b=0.0276.

a^3 = 0.512.

3a^2 b = 3*(0.64)*(0.0276) = 3*(0.0177) = 0.0531.

3ab² = 3*(0.8)*(0.00076176) → 3 * 0.000609408 = 0.001828224.

b^3 = (0.0276)^3 ≈ 2.05e-5.

Adding them up: 0.512 + 0.0531 = 0.5651; plus 0.001828 → 0.5669, plus 0.00002 → about 0.5669.

So the ratio is approximately 0.5669.

So T1^2 / T2^2 = 0.5669 → T2^2 = T1^2 / 0.5669 → T2 = T1 / sqrt(0.5669).

sqrt(0.5669) is approximately 0.753. So T2 = 15.95 / 0.753 ≈ 21.2 days.

So the option B is 21.3 days. That seems correct.

To determine the orbital period of Hyperion using Kepler's third law, we start with the proportionality:

\[
\frac{T_1^2}{T_2^2} = \frac{R_1^3}{R_2^3}
\]

Here:
- \( T_1 = 15.95 \, \text{days} \) (orbital period of Titan),
- \( R_1 = 1.22 \times 10^9 \, \text{m} \) (mean orbital radius of Titan),
- \( R_2 = 1.48 \times 10^9 \, \text{m} \) (mean orbital radius of Hyperion).

First, calculate the ratio of the radii:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{1.22}{1.48} \approx 0.8276
\]

Next, cube this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^3 = (0.8276)^3 \approx 0.5669
\]

Substitute into the proportionality equation:

\[
\frac{T_1^2}{T_2^2} = 0.5669
\]

Take the square root of both sides:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.5669} \approx 0.753
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 = \frac{T_1}{0.753} \approx \frac{15.95}{0.753} \approx 21.2 \, \text{days}
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is **21.3 days**, which corresponds to option B.
