Okay, let's see. I've got this question about group theory, specifically about solvable groups and groups of prime-power order. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer.

So, the question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. Let me break them down.

Statement 1 says, "Every solvable group is of prime-power order." Wait, is that right? Solvable groups, right, have a derived series that terminates in the trivial group. But does that mean they have to be of prime power order?

I remember that solvable groups can be, for example, abelian groups. Abelian groups are solvable, but their order doesn't have to be a prime power. Like, take the symmetric group S3, which is solvable, but it's of order 6, which is 2×3, not a prime power. So Statement 1 can't be always true because there are solvable groups that are not of prime power order. So Statement 1 is false.

Now Statement 2 says, "Every group of prime-power order is solvable." Let's think about that. A group of order p^k, where p is prime. I think that's solvable because all finite p-groups are solvable. Because the derived series eventually reaches the trivial group. So yes, Statement 2 is true.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me double-check. So for statement 1, since not all solvable groups are p-groups, that's false. Statement 2, since all p-groups are solvable, that's true.

Looking at the options, I need to find which option matches. Let me list the options again:

A: Statement 1 is always true, Statement 2 is false only for certain groups.

B: True, True.

C: Statement 1 is always false, Statement 2 is true only for certain groups.

D: True, False

E: Statement 1 is true only for certain groups, Statement 2 is always true.

F: Statement 1 is false only for certain groups, Statement 2 is always true.

G: Both statements are sometimes true, sometimes false.

H: False, False.

I: False, True.

J: Statement 1 is always false, Statement 2 is always false.

So, from earlier, Statement 1 is false (so A, C, D, E, J are out because they say Statement 1 is always true or false. So the correct options are B, C, or G.

Wait, but Statement 2 is always true. So what about Option D: True, False. That would be B. Because B says Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is True. But wait, no. Wait, I thought Statement 1 was false. So Option B cannot be correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go through each option again.

Option B: Both statements are True. But I know Statement 1 is false. So B is incorrect.

Option D: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. But Statement 2 is True, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Statement 1 is True only for certain groups. But Statement 1 is false, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Statement 1 is false only for certain groups, Statement 2 is True always. So Statement 2 is always true (F is correct), but Statement 1 is false only for certain groups (so F is correct. Let me check if F is correct.

Wait, the question is about whether the statements are true or false. Statement 1 is false, so for statement 1, it's not always true. So F says "Statement 1 is false only for certain groups," which is correct because it's not always true. Statement 2 is true always, so F is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 1 is false. So, the correct answer would have to be F? Let me check the options again.

Wait, no. Because the options are about whether each statement is true or false. So, when the question is "Which of the following is correct", the correct answer is the option where each statement is evaluated.

Statement 1 is false. So the correct options would be option F, which says Statement 1 is false only for certain groups, and Statement 2 is always true.

Wait, but I thought Statement 2 was always true. So if both are correct, then the correct option would be B, but that's incorrect because Statement 1 is false.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's make a table.

Option B: Both statements are true. So Statement 1 is true (which it's not) → B is wrong.

Option F: Statement 1 is false only for certain groups (which is correct), and Statement 2 is True (which is correct). So F says that statement 1 is false only for certain groups, and statement 2 is always true.

But wait, the question is about the statements themselves being true or false. So if someone says Statement 1 is True, is that true? No. So the correct answer would be the option that states that these statements are both true. But Statement 1 is false. So the correct option would not be B.

Looking back, the correct answer is that Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true.

So the correct option is F.

Wait, no. Because F says "Statement 1 is false only for certain groups" and "Statement 2 is always true". So both of these are true statements. So if someone is evaluating whether the two statements are correct on their own, then F's statements are correct.

The correct answer is F: Statement 1 is false only for certain groups, and Statement 2 is always true. 

Step-by-step explanation:
- Statement 1 is false because not all solvable groups are of prime power order (e.g., symmetric group S3).
- Statement 2 is true because every group of prime power order is solvable (p-groups are solvable).

Options analysis:
- B is incorrect because Statement 1 is false.
- F correctly states both statements are true in their own right.

ANSWER: F
