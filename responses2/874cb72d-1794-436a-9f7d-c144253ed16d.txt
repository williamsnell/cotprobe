Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (3^x)/(1 + 3^{-x}) and then determine the possible values of g(2023), where g(x) is that asymptote. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that the graph of the function approaches as x goes to positive or negative infinity. So, I need to analyze the behavior of f(x) as x becomes very large in both positive and negative directions.

Starting with the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is 3^x. As x approaches positive infinity, 3^x grows without bound because 3 is a positive number greater than 1. So, 3^x tends to infinity as x goes to infinity.

What about the denominator? The denominator is 1 + 3^{-x}. Let's think about 3^{-x}. That's the same as 1/(3^x). So, as x approaches positive infinity, 3^{-x} becomes 1 divided by a very large number, which approaches zero. So, the denominator becomes 1 + 0, which is 1.

Therefore, as x approaches positive infinity, f(x) behaves like 3^x divided by 1, which means f(x) tends to infinity. So, there's no horizontal asymptote on the right side because it goes to infinity.

Now, what about as x approaches negative infinity? Let's see. When x is negative, 3^x becomes 3^{-|x|}, which is 1/(3^{|x|}). As x approaches negative infinity, 3^{|x|} becomes a very large number, so 3^{-x} approaches zero. So, the denominator 1 + 3^{-x} approaches 1 as x tends to negative infinity.

Now, the numerator 3^x when x is negative is 1/(3^{|x|}), which approaches zero as x approaches negative infinity because the denominator becomes very large. So, the function f(x) is approximately (something approaching zero) divided by 1, which means f(x) approaches zero.

So, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches zero. That means the horizontal asymptote is y=0. Therefore, g(x) = 0 for all x, including x = 2023. So, g(2023) is 0.

Looking at the options, option J is 0. So the answer should be J.

The function f(x) = (3^x)/(1 + 3^{-x}) has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 as x approaches negative infinity. Therefore, g(2023) = 0.

Answer: J
