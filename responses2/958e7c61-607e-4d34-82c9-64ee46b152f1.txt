Okay, so I need to figure out the correct selection procedures for choosing a manager. I remember that selecting a manager involves several key factors. Let me think about what each of these factors entails.

First, personality tests are probably important because they assess the candidate's suitability for leadership. Tests can reveal traits like emotional intelligence, team building, and leadership potential. Then there's social media presence, which shows how someone interacts with others, which is crucial for building relationships and managing a team effectively.

Volunteer work history might indicate a candidate's ability to work independently and contribute to a team's goals, especially in a managerial role. Leadership style is another big one because a manager needs to inspire and guide team members, which depends on the candidate's communication and decision-making skills.

Looking at the options, option C lists several factors like social maturity, intelligence, motivation, and leadership style. That seems comprehensive. Social maturity ensures the candidate can have good interpersonal skills, which is vital for managing a team. Intelligence and motivation are also important for leadership roles. Leadership style directly impacts how a manager leads.

Option B includes personality, social media, and volunteer work. While these are good, the leadership style is missing, which is a big gap. Option A is too simple and doesn't cover any of the critical areas. Option D seems off-topic, focusing on personal attributes rather than professional ones.

So, the correct answer should include factors that assess personality, leadership, and interpersonal skills. Option C covers all that: social maturity, intelligence, motivation, leadership style, and social media presence. That makes sense because a manager needs all these traits to lead effectively.
