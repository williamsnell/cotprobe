Question:

Which single statement about fat digestion and absorption is correct?


Options:

A: Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum
B: After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.
C: The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption
D: Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about fat digestion and absorption. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out which statement is correct. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, so I'll have to think carefully.

The question is asking which single statement about fat digestion and absorption is correct. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I'll recall what I know about fat digestion. Fatty acids are processed in the duodenum, the first part of the colon. I remember that the main enzymes there are lipase and amylase. But wait, the transport proteins come into play when it comes to the absorption in the colon and the digestive tract.

Option A says that absorption occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 in enterocytes of the distal duodenum. I think FABP is involved in the first part of digestion, like in the small intestine. But wait, the distal duodenum is the last part of the colon. Or maybe it's the duodenum itself? Or perhaps the small intestine's duodenum? I'm a bit confused. I know that FABP is involved in the first part of digestion, but I'm not sure where the other proteins are. Maybe CD36 is part of the absorptive cells, like the enterocytes? I'm not certain.

Option B claims that medium chain triglycerides (MCT) go to the lymphatic system and long chain (LCG) to the portal. Wait, I thought MCTs are absorbed into the blood first, maybe in the small intestine. Long chain triglycerides are stored in the liver and then sent to the portal blood system. So B might be correct or incorrect. But I'm not sure if MCTs go to the lymphatic system. I remember that MCTs are absorbed into the blood, which is the portal system, not the lymphatic. So maybe option B is wrong.

Option C states that products of partial digestion become mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids, increasing absorption. I think that's correct. Partial digestion of triglycerides gives a mix of small and large micelles. The presence of pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids in these micelles enhances absorption. I've read that in some cases, the presence of these can improve absorption.

Option D claims that triglycerides must be emulsified and digested before fatty acids can be transported. Wait, I think that's not right. Emulsification is more about the small molecules, like phospholipids. Triglycerides are already emulsified in the small intestine, so maybe this isn't the correct point. Also, I thought that in the small intestine, triglycerides break down into fatty acids, lipase, and phospholipids. So perhaps D is incorrect.

Let me go back to option A. The distal duodenum is the last part of the colon. FABP is involved in the first part of the small intestine's digestion. Wait, no, FABP is involved in the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum). So maybe A is incorrect because it's talking about the distal duodenum. Or perhaps the correct statement is about the small intestine's duodenum.

Option B seems incorrect. MCTs are absorbed into the small intestine, and LCGs go to the portal. So B is wrong.

Option C seems correct. Partial digestion of triglycerides into small and large micelles with other stuff enhances absorption. That's a correct point.

Option D: "Triglycerides must be emulsified and digested before...". I think triglycerides are already emulsified in the small intestine. So the idea that you need to digest them is wrong. So D is incorrect.

So the correct answer is either A or C. Let me think again about A.

Option A says absorption occurs in enterocytes of the distal duodenum. Wait, the distal duodenum is the last part of the colon, not the duodenum. Or is it the same as duodenum? I think the duodenum is the first part of the colon, and the last part is the last segment (distal duodenum). But the enterocytes there are the ones that absorb the triglycerides. So perhaps A is correct.

Wait another thing. So the absorption into the small intestine occurs at the duodenum. The FABP enzyme is in the duodenum, and the transport proteins are in enterocytes, which are part of the duodenum. So option A says distal duodenum, which is correct. So A is correct.

But wait, the way the statement is phrased: "absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum" — no, wait, FABP is part of the small intestine, not the duodenum. Because FABP is in the duodenum. So the statement would have FABP in the duodenum, which is part of the colon, not the enterocytes (duodenum is the main part, but the enterocytes are the same as duodenum). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, enterocytes are the same as the duodenum. The duodenum is the part of the colon where the first part of digestion happens. So the transport proteins are in enterocytes (duodenum). So option A is correct.

Wait, but FABP is in the duodenum, so their statement would be correct. So A is correct.

But wait, the statement says "absorption of fatty acids... occurs mainly through FABP and... in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum." Wait, FABP is in the duodenum, which is also the enterocytes. So that part is correct. So A is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps some sources say that FABP is in the duodenum and other transport proteins are in enterocytes (duodenum). So A is correct.

So the correct answer is A and C. Or wait, what about C?

Option C says that products of partial digestion form mixed micelles with other stuff. I think that's correct because the presence of other components like phospholipids and other chylomicrons (like pancreatic cholesterol) increases the absorption of triglycerides. So C is correct.

Wait, but the question is which single statement is correct. So which one is correct.

I think both A and C are correct statements, but the options are presented as single statements, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, no, the options are each statements. So the correct answer is the one that's correct.

So in the options, I have to choose one.

Let me reevaluate each option.

Option A: Correct? Because FABP is in the duodenum, which is enterocytes. So the statement is correct.

Option C: Correct, as the products form mixed micelles which increase absorption. So C is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the correct statement. Are both A and C correct, or only one? Because the options are mutually exclusive. Or perhaps the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, I might have to think about the other options.

Option B: MCTs go into the portal, LCGs into the lymphatic. So B is incorrect because MCTs are in the small intestine.

Option D: Triglycerides must be digested before ... which is wrong because they are already digested.

So back to the options.

Option C is correct. So the correct answer is C. Because the statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which single statement is correct. So if both A and C are correct, then perhaps I'm mistaken.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake with option A. Because FABP is part of the small intestine, not the duodenum. Because the duodenum is the part where FABP works. The transport proteins are in enterocytes of the distal duodenum.

So FABP is in the duodenum, so in option A, "absorptions in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum" — no, FABP is in the duodenum, but the statement is about the transport proteins in enterocytes of distal duodenum. So the statement is correct. Because the statement says that the transport proteins are in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum. Since FABP is in the duodenum, which is the same as the enterocytes, the transport proteins are present in enterocytes (duodenum). So option A is correct.

Wait, but I thought FABP is in the duodenum. So this statement is correct.

So among the options, both A and C are correct? But the question states which single statement is correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let's re-examine each option.

Option A is correct if FABP is in the duodenum, which is the enterocytes. So the statement is accurate.

Option C is correct because the products of partial digestion form mixed micelles with other stuff, which increases absorption. That's correct.

So if both A and C are correct, but the question allows only one correct statement, which is the case. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option C. Another thought: 'mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids' — that's correct because the presence of these components enhances absorption. So C is correct.

So both A and C are correct? But the options are presented as single statements. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option A is incorrect because FABP is in the duodenum, which is the same as enterocytes, but option A says "distal duodenum enterocytes". So that's correct as well.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the source of the statements. Some sources say that FABP is in the duodenum, and the transport proteins are in enterocytes (duodenum). So option A is correct.

So if both A and C are correct, but the question gives four options, and only one is correct, perhaps my analysis is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let me reevaluate.

Option A: Absorption occurs in enterocytes of the distal duodenum. Distal duodenum is the same as the duodenum, which is where FABP works. So their statement is correct.

Option C: The products of partial digestion form mixed micelles with other stuff, increasing absorption. So that's correct.

But the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer. So perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, perhaps option A is incorrect because FABP is in the small intestine, not the enterocytes of the duodenum. Oh wait, enterocytes are the same as the duodenum. So FABP is in the duodenum, and the statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible correct answers.

The correct options are (A and C) both correct, but the question allows only one. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, option C says: "The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption."

Yes, that's correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, but the question is about absorption. So both A and C are correct. But the question gives four options, and the correct answer is likely C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because A is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm not sure about option A. Because FABP is in the duodenum, which is the enterocytes. So the transport proteins are in the enterocytes of the duodenum. So the statement in A is correct. So both statements A and C are correct.

But the question only allows one correct option, so perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Which of the options is correct?

As per my analysis:

Option A: Correct.

Option C: Correct.

But the answer choices are single, so perhaps the correct answer is 'A' because the other statement is incorrect. Or perhaps I'm mistaken about C.

Wait, another way: the statement in C is correct, so perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating option A.

Wait, another point: the transport proteins mentioned in option A are in enterocytes of the distal duodenum. But in the duodenum, the enterocytes are the same as the duodenum. So the statement is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question is about which single statement is correct. So if both A and C are correct, but the options only allow one, perhaps I was wrong about one of them.

Wait, another angle: the description of option C. The products of partial digestion (so small and large micelles) with other stuff (like phospholipids, etc.) which increase absorption. That's correct.

So perhaps both A and C are correct. But looking back, the options are:

A: Absorption occurs in enterocytes of the distal duodenum. (correct, since FABP is in the duodenum, which is the enterocytes.)

C: Products form mixed micelles, increasing absorption. Correct.

But the options are single statements. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the question is which single statement is correct. So if both A and C are correct, but the options are given as single choices, perhaps I should look for the one that's more accurate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about option A.

Wait, let's read more carefully.

Option A: "Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum"

So FABP is the enzyme that breaks down triglycerides. In the duodenum, the first part, FABP is present, and the transport proteins are in the enterocytes (duodenum). So the statement says "in the distal duodenum enterocytes". So that's correct.

So option A is correct.

Wait, but is the statement correct? Because I thought that FABP is in the duodenum, which is the same as the enterocytes. So the statement is correct.

But then, if both A and C are correct, but the options are single, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option C. Let me read again:

"The products of partial digestion... form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption."

Yes, that's correct. So option C is correct.

So now I'm a bit confused. Because both A and C are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to choose option C, because the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the question says which single statement is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C. But the options are presented as single answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere. Let me try to think.

Wait, I think I remember that the presence of these other substances (like phospholipids and others) does enhance the ability to be absorbed, which supports option C being correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is C.

But wait, another thought: the statement in option A says "absorptions occur in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum". The enterocytes are the same as the duodenum, which is the distal duodenum. So A is correct.

So both A and C are correct.

But since the question allows only one correct answer, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 'correct' answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: MCT goes into the small intestine, LCG into the lymphatic. So B is incorrect.

Option D: Triglycerides must be emulsified and digested before ... — That's incorrect because triglycerides are already emulsified in the small intestine.

So the only possible correct options are A and C.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps option A's statement is incorrect because FABP is in the duodenum, not in enterocytes of the distal duodenum. No, wait, the distal duodenum is part of the duodenum, which is the same as the enterocytes. So FABP is in the duodenum, so their statement is correct.

So perhaps both A and C are correct. But the options don't allow for multiple correct answers. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps only option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

In that case, I'll proceed to choose option C.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option carefully:

### Option A
"The absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum."

- FABP (Fatty Acids Breakdown-Associated Protein) is indeed involved in the first part of digestion, specifically in the distal duodenum (the last segment of the colon) of the small intestine. The transport proteins associated with FABP are also present in the enterocytes (duodenum) of the distal duodenum.
- This statement is correct.

### Option B
"After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides (LCG) enter the portal blood system."

- Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are actually absorbed into the bloodstream first and are stored in the liver for later absorption as long chain triglycerides (LCG). LCGs are transported into the portal blood system, while MCTs are absorbed into the bloodstream.
- This statement is incorrect.

### Option C
"The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption."

- Triglycerides are digested into fatty acids, lipase, and phospholipids in the small intestine. The products of partial digestion form mixed micelles, which enhance the absorption of triglycerides by incorporating additional components like pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids.
- This statement is correct.

### Option D
"Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported."

- Triglycerides are already emulsified in the small intestine, and they are digested into fatty acids. There is no need for triglycerides to be emulsified and digested before transport.
- This statement is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Both **A** and **C** are correct. However, since the question specifies a single correct answer, **C** is the best choice as it focuses on a key biological process described in the statement.
