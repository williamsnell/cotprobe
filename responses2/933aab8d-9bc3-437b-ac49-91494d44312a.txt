Question:

A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial photographic studios in the city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax

Options:

A: unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.
B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.
C: constitutional, as it is within the city's rights to tax local businesses.
D: unconstitutional, as it infringes on the rights of local businesses.
E: constitutional, as it is a fair method of raising municipal revenue.
F: unconstitutional, as it is a form of double taxation.
G: constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.
H: constitutional, as it is a reasonable exercise of the city's taxing power.
I: unconstitutional, as it unfairly targets a specific profession.
J: constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about tax constitutionality. Let me read through it again.

The city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial photographic studios. Then there's another tax of $100 per year on itinerant commercial photographers using the streets and sidewalks. But here's the twist: a credit is allowed against the $100 tax for any excise tax paid by the photographer or his employer for maintaining a studio. 

Now, the question is about a studio challenging the $200 tax. The options are about whether this tax is unconstitutional or constitutional.

I remember from my tax classes that excise taxes are often tied to state or city regulations. So if the tax is imposed on a specific type of business (like commercial photographers), it might be considered a state tax without a clear business purpose. That could be a problem under the tax-purposes clause of the First Amendment, which says taxes should be limited to the purposes they are imposed on.

Wait, but in this case, the tax is on two different types of businesses. The $100 tax is for using streets and sidewalks, which is a privilege. The $200 is for commercial photographic studios, which are a serious industry. So maybe the $200 tax is for a specific business type, which the court might see as a double taxation or an undue burden on interstate commerce or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the $100 tax is not a privilege, but that's a stretch. The privilege tax is a state right, so the city can't tax it. But if the $200 is on a specific business, it might be considered a business privilege not allowed to be taxed. 

Wait, another angle: the tax on the photographers is a tax on the privilege of doing business on public roads, which might be a state right. So the city can't tax commercial photographers because they're part of the privilege. But the $200 tax on the studio might be on a specific business that's a serious industry. So maybe that's a state enterprise tax or something. 

Wait, but the problem says the tax on the photographers is $100 per year, and there's a credit that allows the studio tax (200) to be reduced by any amount paid to the city by the photographer or his employer to maintain a studio. So the $200 is being allowed to be partially offset.

I think when a tax is imposed on a specific type of business or activity, it's considered a state tax, and thus the city can't impose it without a business purpose. If the $200 is for commercial photographic studios, which are a serious form of business, then it might not have a clear business purpose, making it unconstitutional as an excise tax. 

But wait, the $100 tax is on "the privilege of doing business within the state," which I think refers to using streets and sidewalks. That's a state right, so the city can tax it. So the $100 tax is allowed, but the $200 is specifically for a business that's part of the privilege? That could be the problem.

Wait, no, the privilege tax (100) is on using public roads, which are a state right. The 200 is on business activities, which are a specific type of commercial activity. So the city can't tax commercial photographers unless it's a state enterprise tax. Because commercial photographers are a significant part of the city's business, perhaps they deserve a state tax. 

So the court would likely say the 200 tax is unconstitutional as an excise tax because it's an undue burden on interstate commerce. Because excise taxes are about the state—so a specific business is a burden on interstate commerce. Or maybe it's about the privilege tax, which is a state right, but the 200 is a specific business, which might be seen as an additional burden.

Alternatively, the $100 tax is on the privilege, which is a state right, so it's allowed. The $200 is a specific business, so it's an excise tax on that business. If the city is required to pay excise taxes on specific businesses without a clear business purpose, that's unconstitutional. 

So the tax on the photographers is a state enterprise tax. I think in the U.S., state taxes on enterprises are considered unconstitutional unless the government is required to provide the business with a license or something. But the problem here says a credit is allowed for any amount paid by the photographer's employer to maintain a studio. So the city is allowed to reduce the tax on the photographers by the amount they pay for the studio. 

Wait, so for the photographers, the city is allowed to take away the tax on the $200, but how? The $100 tax is a privilege, so the city can tax it. But the $200 is a specific business—when the city imposes a tax on a specific activity, it's an excise tax. If the activity is part of a specific business, maybe it's not allowed. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The privilege tax (100) is on the privilege of using public roads, which is a state right. So the city can tax it. But commercial photographers are a serious business. So the $200 tax on them might be an excise tax on a specific business, which isn't allowed unless it's a state enterprise tax. 

But the problem says that a credit is allowed against the $100 tax for the amount paid by the photographer's employer to maintain a studio. So for the photographers, any amount paid to the city to maintain a studio is a credit against the $200 tax. 

Wait, but the $200 tax is on commercial photographic studios. So for every $100 tax paid by the photographer to the city (for the studio), the city can credit $200 towards the $200 tax. This is a form of fair tax, because the city is reducing the tax on the specific activity (the photographers) by the amount they contribute to the business. 

But if the city is imposing a tax on commercial photographers, which are a specific type of business, and that's not a state enterprise tax, then it's unconstitutional. Because excise taxes on specific businesses without a clear business purpose are unconstitutional. 

So the court would likely say the tax is unconstitutional as it's an undue burden on interstate commerce or as an excise tax on a specific business. That would point to option A or B.

Option A: unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.

Option B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.

Wait, but the privilege tax (100) is on using public roads, which is a state right. So the city can tax it. But the 200 is on a specific business. So why is the 200 tax considered a state enterprise tax? Because commercial photographers are a significant part of the city's business, so the tax is on a specific business without a clear purpose, making it unconstitutional.

So the court would likely decide it's unconstitutional for being a state tax on a specific business without a clear purpose. So the options are A or B. 

The question is about the 200 tax, which is on commercial photographic studios. So the court would find it unconstitutional because it's an excise tax on a specific business, not a state enterprise tax. Therefore, the answer is A or B.

But wait, the 100 tax is on the privilege, which is a state right. The 200 is on a specific business. So if the 200 is a specific business, it's an excise tax on that specific activity, which isn't allowed unless it's a state enterprise tax. So the court would say it's unconstitutional.

So the options are:

A: unconstitutional as undue burden on interstate commerce.

B: unconstitutional as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.

Wait, the privilege tax is a state right, so the city can tax it. But the 200 is a specific business. So it's not a privilege tax, but the city is imposing a tax on a specific business without a clear business purpose. So it's an unconstitutional excise tax.

Looking at the answer options, option A says it's unconstitutional as an undue burden on interstate commerce. Option B says it's unconstitutional as a discriminatory tax on the privilege.

I think the key here is whether the 200 tax is a state enterprise tax. If the city is required to tax specific enterprises, it's unconstitutional. So the court would likely hold it's unconstitutional because it's an excise tax on a specific business without a clear purpose.

So looking at the options, option A would be the case. So the answer is A.

The city imposes two taxes: a $100 excise tax on using public roads (a privilege tax) and a $200 tax on commercial photographic studios. A credit is allowed against the $100 tax for amounts paid by photographers' employers to maintain a studio. The question is whether the $200 tax on commercial photographers is constitutional.

Commercial photographers are a significant part of the city's business, making the $200 tax on them potentially subject to constitutional scrutiny. Excise taxes on specific businesses without a clear business purpose are generally unconstitutional. Since the $200 tax is an excise tax on a specific activity (commercial photographers), it violates the First Amendment's restriction on state taxes on specific businesses. The court would likely find it unconstitutional as an undue burden on interstate commerce or as an excise tax on a specific business.

Option A, which states the tax is unconstitutional as an undue burden on interstate commerce, aligns with this reasoning.
