Question:

List and define the three behavior control systems promulgatedbyBandura(1969).

Options:

A: Behavior is controlled by instinctual drives, learned skills, and random environmental events.
B: Behavior is controlled by historical context, societal expectations, and individual mood states.
C: Behavior is controlled by sensory perceptions, memory recall, and future predictions.
D: Behavior is controlled by external stimuli, by their consequences or by internal (symbolic) processes.
E: Behavior is controlled by financial status, educational background, and media consumption.
F: Behavior is controlled by subconscious desires, astrological influences, and peer pressure.
G: Behavior is controlled by genetic predisposition, environmental factors and personal experiences.
H: Behavior is controlled by spiritual beliefs, physical needs, and external rewards.
I: Behavior is controlled by personal beliefs, social norms and cultural influences.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer here. The question is about Bandura's behavior conditioning theories. I remember that Bandura's work involved his concept of reciprocal causation, which he introduced. From what I recall, he talked about three behavior control systems.

Wait, the options are A to I, and the correct answer is one of them. The question asks to list and define three behavior control systems promoted by Bandura in 1969. So I need to think about what those three systems are.

I think the first one might be the instinctual system. That's where the organism is guided by internal biological factors. Like how children are taught to follow their parents' commands because of their instinctual drives. So instinctual drives like fear or curiosity would be part of that.

The second behavior control system is learned skills. This probably refers to the conditioning through Reward-Prevention. Like how children are taught to associate a reward with a behavior and avoid it without the reward. So this would be learned behavior.

The third one I'm a bit less sure about. It might be something about symbolic processes, like how children use symbols and meanings to understand and control their environment. Maybe this is the symbolic-representation system. It's about using symbols and meanings to guide behavior.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. 

Option A: Behavior controlled by instinctual drives, learned skills, and random events. That sounds right because instinctual is about biological drives, learned skills through conditioning, and random events, like environmental shocks.

Option B: Historical context, societal expectations, and mood. That doesn't fit with Bandura's work. I think he focused more on biological factors and learned conditioning.

Option C: Sensory, memory, and future predictions. That doesn't sound familiar. I'm not sure about that. 

Option D: External stimuli, consequences, or internal processes. Hmm. The third part is internal processes, which could be symbolic, but I'm not certain if that's a primary system.

Option E: Financial status, education, media. Those are external factors, but Bandura's main systems were more about biological and learned aspects.

Option F: Subconscious desires, astrological, peer pressure. I'm not sure if Bandura talked about astrological influences. Maybe some theories, but I'm not certain.

Option G: Genetic predisposition, environment, personal. That's more about genetics and environment, which are part of Bandura's systems but perhaps not the three he specifically identified.

Option H: Spiritual, physical, external rewards. Doesn't ring a bell.

Option I: Personal beliefs, social norms, cultural factors. That sounds like what I was thinking earlierâ€”symbolic, learned, and environmental (but environmental here would be social and cultural factors).

Wait, looking back, the three systems I thought were:

1. Instinctual: biological drives (like fear or curiosity)
2. Learned: conditioning through reward prevention
3. Symbolic: using symbols and meanings to guide behavior.

So in the options, the correct answer would be option I: Behavior is controlled by personal beliefs, social norms, and cultural influences.

Let me check the options again.

Option I says: Behavior is controlled by personal beliefs, social norms, and cultural influences. That fits with what I was thinking.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The correct answer is **I: Behavior is controlled by personal beliefs, social norms, and cultural influences**. This aligns with Bandura's behavior conditioning theory, which identifies three systems: instinctual (biological drives), learned skills (conditioning through reward-avoidance), and symbolic processes (using meanings and symbols). 

**Answer: I**
