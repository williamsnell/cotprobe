Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a poem and comparing it to a given speech. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question says: The question refers to a poem by Phillis Wheatley. I need to find which of the given options best matches the poem's point. The options are various speeches or quotes from famous figures.

The poem in question is "Someview our sable race with scornful eye," and it talks about the God and Savior. It's about redemption and joining the angelic train. The poem is about the possibility of salvation and redemption through faith and grace.

Now, looking at the options, each is a speech or quote from a famous person. Let me go through each option:

A) Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet" speech. That's about resistance and standing up for someone, not about redemption or salvation.

B) MLK's "I Have a Dream." It's about the end of slavery and the fight for freedom, focusing on overcoming oppression, not about redemption.

C) Lincoln's "Emancipation Proclamation." That's about the Civil War and ending slavery through a new legal system, which is about the abolition of slavery, not about God or redemption.

D) Seneca Falls Declaration. It's a pro自由 and equality speech, mainly about the rights of the people, not about redemption or salvation.

E) Thomas Paine's "Common Sense." That's a critique of the old ways of thinking, promoting progress and democracy.

F) Mandela's "I Am Prepared to Die." He's a strong advocate for his freedom movement, emphasizing that people are not to be reduced to necessity. It's about the principles of freedom and not directly about redemption or salvation.

G) Douglass's "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" It's a speech about the meaning of freedom, not about redemption.

H) Jonathan Edwards' sermon. He discussed God's anger towards sinners, which is about God's role and sin, not about redemption.

I) Kennedy's "Ich bin ein Berliner." It's about becoming a Berliner (a Southern revolutionary) and expressing pride, again about resistance and identity.

J) The Declaration of Independence. That's about the separation of国王 and the need for a new government, not about redemption or salvation.

Wait, looking again, the poem in question talks about God (or a Saviour) who can save those who understand. So the themes are about redemption and the possibility of divine intervention. That's a big theme in the Bible and, I think, in the poem.

Now, looking at the options, none of them talk about God or redemption. So maybe I should think about the key themes of the poem. The poem is about redemption through faith and grace. The key idea seems to be about the possibility of redemption and the idea that those who are saved can join the "angelic train."

So what do the options present? The options are about speeches or quotes. The poem's point is about redemption and the possibility of dying for sin in the name of God. So the best match would be something that reflects the idea of redemption and the possibility of a God who can save someone.

Looking at the options, the answer has to be one of these. None of the options are about redemption or God. So perhaps the question is looking for the closest comparison in terms of themes.

Wait, let's think again. The poem is from a Black person, not a white one. It's about the God of the Bible, not the Black community. So the point being made is about the possibility of redemption through divine intervention, not about the personal experience of being saved by God.

So looking for a speech that's about redemption or the possibility of dying for sin. The options are all about different historical events.

Option A is about resistance, B about freedom, etc. So none of these directly relate to redemption or the divine saving.

Wait, the question says, "the point of wheatley's poem can best be compared to which of the following." The options are various speeches, but the poem's main theme is about redemption through God, which I don't see in any of the options except perhaps the one that's about the possibility of dying for sin, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I need to consider that none of the options are about redemption, but the next best match would be the one that's about people dying for sin. For example, the "I Am Prepared to Die" speech, but that's option F.

Wait, the options are:

F: Mandela's speech.

But what's the key point of the poem? It's about redemption through God. The poem's point is about the possibility of dying (redemption) for sin in order to be saved (by God). So the poem is about the redemption of all Men, not about a particular person.

So which option is about the possibility of dying for sin? The answer would be something about dying for sin. I don't see that in the options. So perhaps the question is asking for a comparison to a speech that deals with the idea of dying or redemption.

Wait, the options are A to J, each being a different speech. So the poem's point is about the possibility of dying for sin in order to be saved by God. The best match would be an option that reflects that idea. 

Wait, but all the options are about different historical events. So perhaps the answer is none. But the given options must have one.

Wait, perhaps the best match is the one that is about the possibility of dying for sin. Looking at the options:

Option F: Mandela's speech is about dying for sin.

Option I: Kennedy's speech is about becoming a Berliner, which is about resistance, not redemption.

Option J: The Declaration of Independence is about separation of国王, not about redemption.

So the poem's theme is about being saved through God ( redemption). The answer is probably F, which is Mandela's speech, which is about dying for sin. But that's not directly about redemption, but about dying.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the idea that people are prone to sin (as in the "What to the Slave..." speech), which I don't think it is.

Wait, but the poem is about God's intervention. So the answer would be the option that's about dying for sin. Since none of the options have a direct match, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the poem's opening line is "Taught my benighted soul..." which implies the possibility of redemption. That's about dying for sin in order to be saved.

Ah, so the key point is that people can die for sin to be saved. So the speech that's about dying for sin would be the best fit. Looking at the options, option F is Mandela's speech, which is about dying for sin.

Wait, but wait. The options are:

F: Mandela's speech.

J: Declaration of Independence.

So the question is, the poem's point is about the possibility of dying for sin to be saved. So the answer would be option F, which is Mandela's speech.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is, which of the options best matches the poem's point. The poem's point is about the possibility of dying for sin to be saved. The options are about various historical events.

Which of the options talks about dying? Option F is about dying for sin. So the poem is about dying for sin to be saved, so the best match is F.

Wait, but another thought: the poem's point is about the possibility of dying for sin to be saved, but the options are about the actual killing process. Perhaps the poem is about the idea that people are prone to sin, but the 'sable race' refers to the people of the Pagan land. So the point is about the God of the Bible, not about any particular person or event.

So the best match would be the option that reflects the idea of dying for sin, which is option F, Mandela's speech about dying.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Malcolm X's speech

B: MLK's speech

C: Lincoln's

D: Seneca Falls

E: Paine

F: Mandela's

G: Douglass

H: Edwards

I: Kennedy

J: Declaration of Independence.

So the poem's point is about the possibility of dying for sin to be saved. So the answer is F: Mandela's speech.

The poem by Phillis Wheatley centers on the possibility of redemption through God, emphasizing that people are prone to sin but can be saved through divine intervention. This theme aligns with the concept of dying for sin in order to be saved, which is reflected in the idea of people being prone to sin. Among the options, the speech that directly discusses dying for sin is **F: Mandela's "I Am Prepared to Die" speech**. This speech highlights the moral responsibility and willingness of individuals to die for sin to achieve salvation. 

ANSWER: F
