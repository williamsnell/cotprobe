Okay, so I've got this matrix here, right? It's a 3x3 matrix where every row is [1, 1, 1]. Hmm, I need to find its rank. Wait, what's rank again? Oh right, rank is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. So, I guess I should check if the rows are linearly independent.

Let me write down the matrix again to visualize it:

1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1

Looking at it, each row is exactly the same. That seems important. So, if I try to see if any of them can be expressed as a combination of others, I might find out something.

Let me try subtracting the first row from the second row. So, R2 = R2 - R1. That would give me (1-1, 1-1, 1-1) for the second row, which is [0, 0, 0]. So the new matrix would be:

1 1 1
0 0 0
1 1 1

Wait, no, wait. The third row is the same as the first row. So, if I subtract the first row from the third row, R3 = R3 - R1, I get [0, 0, 0] again. So now the matrix looks like this:

1 1 1
0 0 0
0 0 0

So, after doing these row operations, I end up with two rows of zeros. That means only the first row is non-zero. So, does that mean the rank is 1? Because the other rows are linear combinations of the first one.

Wait, another approach: The rank is the number of non-zero rows in the row-echelon form. So, in this case, after the row operations, I have two rows of zeros, so only one non-zero row. So, rank is 1.

Alternatively, columns: Each column is [1,1,1]^T. So, since all columns are the same, they are linearly dependent. That means the maximum number of linearly independent columns is 1. So, rank would be 1.

So the answer should be D: 1.

The matrix has all rows identical, so subtracting any row from another results in a zero row. This means only the first row is non-zero, leading to a rank of 1.

Answer: D
