Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question says, "The frequency of middle C is 256 sec^-1 What is its wavelength in air?" And then there are several options given.

Hmm, wait, frequency is 256 per second. Oh, wait, that's a bit unusual. Because I remember that usually, frequency is given in Hertz, which is 1 per second. So 256 Hz. But I'm not sure, maybe I'll proceed as the question says.

So, the formula I remember is the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength. The formula is v = f * λ. But wait, what's the speed here? Oh right, the speed of sound in air at standard temperature and pressure is about 340 meters per second. Or is it 343? I think 343 m/s is the standard value I remember. Wait, I think I should double-check this. But for the sake of this problem, I'll go with 343 m/s, which is approximately the speed of sound at 20°C.

So, the formula rearranged to solve for wavelength (λ) is λ = v / f.

Given that, frequency f is 256 Hz. The speed v is 343 m/s.

Let me plug in the numbers. So λ = 343 / 256. Let me calculate that. 

343 divided by 256. Let's see, 256 goes into 343 once. 1 times 256 is 256. Subtract that from 343, you get 87. So 87/256 is approximately 0.3414 meters. Wait, because 256 times 0.3 is 76.8, which is a bit less than 87. So 0.3414 m is about 34.14 cm.

Looking at the options, the choices are all in centimeters. The options are A:50 cm, B:133, C:75, D:86, E:400, F:162, G:340, H:200, I:100, J:256 cm.

Wait, wait, 34.14 cm is approximately 34 cm. But none of the options exactly match that. Let's look again. Option G is 340 cm, which is 3.4 meters. That's way too big. Option C is 75 cm, which is 0.75 m. Hmm, 0.75 is much bigger than 34.14. So none of the options match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I misread the frequency. The question says 256 sec^-1. Oh wait, that's the same as 256 Hz. Because 1 sec^-1 is per second, which is Hz. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the speed of sound? Oh, right, the speed of sound in air depends on temperature. At 0°C, it's about 331 m/s, at 20°C it's 343, and at higher temperatures it's higher. But the question doesn't specify, so I'll proceed with 343 m/s.

So, 343 divided by 256 equals approximately 1.3414 meters. Which is 134.14 cm. Let me double-check the calculation. 256 * 1.34 is roughly 256*(1+0.3) = 256 +76.8=332.8. Which is close to 343. So 1.34 meters is about 134 cm. Looking at the options, option B is 133 cm, which is very close. So the correct answer should be B:133 cm.

Wait, but let me see the options again. Oh, option B is 133 cm. So that's the one.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh, wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me compute 343/256 exactly.

256 × 1.34 = 256 × (1 + 0.3 + 0.04) = 256 + 76.8 + 10.24 = 343.04. Oh, exactly 343.04, which is nearly 343. So 1.34 meters is 134 cm. The closest option is 133 cm (option B). But wait, what about the other options? Are any of them close? Let me see.

The options are:

A:50 cm --> 0.5 m
B:133 cm -->1.33 m
C:75 cm =0.75 m
D:86 cm=0.86 m
E:400 cm=4m
F:162 cm=1.62 m
G:340 cm=3.4 m
H:200 cm=2m
I:100 cm=1 m
J:256 cm=2.56 m

Wait, the calculation is 343/256 =1.3414 m, which is approximately 134 cm, but none of the options exactly match. Looking at the options, the closest is B:133 cm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me do it again.

Wait, 256 × 1.34 = 343.04, which is almost exactly 343. So 1.34 meters is 134 cm. So the answer would be approximately 134 cm. But the options don't have 134, but option B is 133 cm. So perhaps rounding down, it would be B.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the frequency given is 256 Hz, but the speed is 343 m/s?

Yes. So, 343 /256 = approx 1.3414 m = 134.14 cm. So the closest option is B:133 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 133 cm, which is 1.33 m. Which is 0.01 m less than the calculated 1.3414. Hmm, but the options don't have 134 cm, so maybe that's why I'm confused.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question intended the frequency to be 256 Hz, which is 256 times per second, same as 256 Hz. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is B:133 cm.

To determine the wavelength of middle C, we use the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength: 

\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
\]

where:
- \( v \) is the speed of sound in air, approximately \( 343 \, \text{m/s} \) at standard conditions.
- \( f \) is the frequency of the sound wave, given as \( 256 \, \text{Hz} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{343}{256} \approx 1.3414 \, \text{m}
\]

Converting meters to centimeters:

\[
\lambda \approx 134.14 \, \text{cm}
\]

Now, comparing this result to the provided options:
- A: 50 cm  
- B: 133 cm  
- C: 75 cm  
- D: 86 cm  
- E: 400 cm  
- F: 162 cm  
- G: 340 cm  
- H: 200 cm  
- I: 100 cm  
- J: 256 cm  

The calculated wavelength of approximately \( 134.14 \, \text{cm} \) is closest to option B: \( 133 \, \text{cm} \). While there is a slight discrepancy (a \( 0.14 \, \text{cm} \) difference), this is the best match among the given options.
