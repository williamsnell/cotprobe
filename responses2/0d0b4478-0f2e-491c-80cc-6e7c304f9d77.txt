Okay, so I have this question about the "in-basket" technique in personnel selection. Hmm, I remember that it's a selection method, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think. The question is asking which type of employee is most likely to use this technique.

First, I should probably recall what the in-basket technique entails. From what I remember, it's a job search strategy where the candidate's application is placed in a basket, and the hiring manager looks for it when they're checking resumes or resumes and CVs. This method helps in narrowing down candidates by eliminating those who are clearly not a match for the job. It's more efficient than sending all applications to everyone, as it's quicker to find a suitable candidate.

Now, looking at the options: the employees listed are from various job sectors—Financial, Customer Service, etc. I think the in-basket technique is commonly used in roles that require a lot of practical skills or where the candidate's experience is more relevant. But wait, which specific job type would this apply to?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The in-basket technique is more about efficiently screening candidates by using their application data. So, it's not specific to a particular type of employee but rather the type of job. But the options provided are types of employees, not types of jobs.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using "employee" in a non-specific way. Or perhaps it's referring to the type of job that's best suited for this method. For example, if someone is a technical person, they might have more hands-on experience and might be more likely to use this method because their skills are more directly applicable to the job.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the type of job that would be the best fit for the in-basket technique. Like, if the job is more about practical skills, then candidates with technical backgrounds might fit better. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The in-basket technique is more about the application process. So, the person using this technique would be the one whose application is placed into the basket, which would be any employee, regardless of their job type. But the question is about the type of employee. So perhaps the correct answer is the type of employee that's most likely to use this method, which could be those who have the most relevant skills.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the type of job that's best suited for this method. For example, in-basket is more effective for technical roles where the candidate's skills are directly relevant. So maybe a managerial or technical employee would be more likely to use this method.

Wait, but the options don't include types of roles but types of employees. So perhaps the question is implying that the employee is a managerial or technical person because their skills are more likely to be tested using this method.

Wait, maybe I should think about other methods. There's also the scoring method, where candidates are scored based on their resume, and then the highest score is chosen. But I think the in-basket is more about screening applications by their application, not the resume.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up types. Perhaps the answer is more general, but the options don't include a category. Wait, the options are A to J, each with a specific type of employee. So it's possible that the correct answer is the type of employee who is most likely to use the in-basket technique, which could be managerial or technical.

Wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit different. Maybe it's about which type of employee is most likely to use this technique, but the options are types of employees, which is a bit confusing because the technique is about the application process.

Another approach: think about the in-basket technique. It's used when the hiring manager is checking resumes and wants to find the best fit. So the candidate's application is placed in the basket, and the manager will check it when they review the resume. So the candidate's application is the key factor.

If the candidate is a managerial, perhaps they can quickly assess the application and see if it's relevant. Or if the candidate is a technical person, they might be more likely to have the technical skills needed for the job, making the application more likely to be in the basket.

Wait, but the question is about using the technique, which would be the employee who has the application. So, the answer would be any employee, but the options don't specify a type. Hmm, but the options are types of employees, so perhaps the correct answer is the type of employee that's best suited for this method. Like, managerial or technical.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the type of employee that's most likely to be a managerial, since they are more likely to use this technique because their skills are more directly applicable. Or maybe the answer is the type of employee who is more likely to have the skills the hiring manager is looking for, which could be technical.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look for more clues. The options are A to J, each a type of employee. The question is about which employee's use of this technique would be most likely. So perhaps the answer is the type of employee who is more likely to use this method, which is someone who is a managerial or technical person.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the type of employee that would be tested more effectively. For example, a managerial employee might be tested more thoroughly because they have more administrative skills, while a technical employee might be tested based on their technical skills.

Wait, I'm not making much progress. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is the type of employee who is most likely to use the in-basket technique. So, for example, a managerial would be more likely because they can quickly assess the application and see if it's relevant. A technical employee might have more direct expertise, so their application would be more likely to be in the basket.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the type of employee who is more likely to have the skills needed for the job, which could be either managerial or technical. But the options don't group the types; they are individual types. So maybe the correct answer is the type of employee who is in a managerial position, hence option G: Managerial.

Wait, but why would a managerial use the in-basket technique? Because they can quickly assess the application and see if it's relevant. Alternatively, a technical person might have more detailed technical skills, so their application would be more likely to be in the basket.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the type of employee who is more likely to be tested by the hiring manager. For example, a managerial might be more likely to have their application evaluated because of the administrative nature of the position.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is someone who is more likely to have their application evaluated for the job. For example, a manager might have more decisions to make, so their application could be more likely to be in the basket.

Wait, I'm going around in circles. Let me try to think of the options again. The options are A through J, each a specific type of employee. So the question is, which of these types of employees is most likely to use the in-basket technique.

So, perhaps it's the type of employee who is more likely to have their application evaluated in this way. For example, a managerial might have more administrative tasks, making them more likely to be tested using this method.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is someone who is a managerial because they are more likely to have their application evaluated quickly.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think of what I know about the in-basket technique. It's a method where the hiring manager places the candidate's application into a basket and then checks it when reviewing resumes. This helps in narrowing down candidates quickly.

So, the candidate's application is the key factor. The type of employee who would use this technique would be the one whose application is placed into the basket. Since the question is about the type of employee, perhaps the correct answer is someone who is a managerial. Because managers are more likely to have their applications evaluated quickly and thoroughly.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the type of employee who would have their application evaluated more efficiently, which could be someone who is more likely to have their skills tested, like a managerial or technical person.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is that the in-basket technique is most likely used by managers. Because managers are more likely to have their application evaluated quickly, and they can assess whether it's relevant for the job. On the other hand, technical employees might have more detailed skills, so their applications would be more likely to be in the basket.

But since the options are individual employee types, perhaps the answer is the type of employee who is most likely to be tested by the in-basket method. So, maybe it's the type of employee who is involved in administrative or more managerial roles.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the type of employee who is most likely to have their application evaluated quickly, which might be a managerial or a technical person.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think of the options again. The options are:

A: Financial
B: Customer Service
C: Technical
D: Sales
E: Marketing
F: Manufacturing
G: Managerial
H: Secretarial
I: Clerical
J: Human Resources

So, the question is, which is the most likely use of in-basket? It's about the type of employee.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G: Managerial, because managers are more likely to fit into the in-basket method. Alternatively, the answer might be C: Technical, because technical skills are directly relevant to the job.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the type of employee who is most likely to have their application evaluated for the job, which could be managerial or technical.

Wait, I'm not sure, but I think the correct answer is G: Managerial. Because managers are more likely to use this technique, as they have administrative tasks, and their applications are more likely to be evaluated quickly and thoroughly.

So, the answer would be G.

The in-basket technique is a job search strategy where the hiring manager places the candidate's application into a basket and checks it when reviewing resumes. This method helps in narrowing down candidates efficiently. The type of employee most likely to use this technique would be one whose application is evaluated quickly and thoroughly. Among the options provided, the type of employee most likely to engage with this method is a managerial, as they are more likely to have their application evaluated quickly and efficiently due to their administrative tasks.

Answer: G
