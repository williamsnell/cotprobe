Okay, so I've got this problem here where I'm supposed to find f(t) given its Laplace transform F(s). The options are A through J, each with different expressions involving delta functions and exponentials multiplied by unit step functions.

Hmm, I remember from my notes that when a Laplace transform has a denominator that factors into terms like (s+a), it suggests that the inverse Laplace transform will involve exponential terms. So, let me start by looking at the given F(s).

F(s) is (2s² +13s +17) divided by (s+1)(s+3). So, denominator is (s+1)(s+3) = s² +4s +3. The numerator is a quadratic, so maybe I can perform partial fraction decomposition to break it down into simpler terms.

So let me set up the partial fractions. Let's say:

F(s) = [A/(s+1)] + [B/(s+3)]

But wait, since the numerator is of higher degree than the denominator, I might need to perform polynomial division first. Let's see: The numerator is 2s² +13s +17, and the denominator is s² +4s +3. So when I divide 2s² +13s +17 by s² +4s +3, the division should be straightforward.

Wait, dividing 2s² +13s +17 by s² +4s +3. The leading terms are 2s² divided by s², which is 2. Multiply the denominator by 2: 2s² +8s +6. Subtract that from the numerator: (2s²+13s+17) - (2s²+8s+6) = 5s +11. So the remainder is 5s +11. So F(s) can be written as 2 + (5s +11)/(s² +4s +3).

Ah, that makes sense. So F(s) = 2 + (5s +11)/[(s+1)(s+3)].

Now, the next step is to decompose (5s +11)/[(s+1)(s+3)] into partial fractions. Let me write:

(5s + 11)/[(s+1)(s+3)] = C/(s+1) + D/(s+3)

Multiply both sides by (s+1)(s+3) to eliminate denominators:

5s +11 = C(s+3) + D(s+1)

Let me solve for C and D. Expanding the right side: Cs + 3C + Ds + D = (C + D)s + (3C + D).

Set this equal to the left side (5s +11), so:

C + D =5  
3C + D =11

Subtract the first equation from the second: (3C + D) - (C + D) = 11 -5 → 2C =6 → C=3.

Then, substituting C=3 into first equation: 3 + D=5 → D=2.

So, the partial fractions are 3/(s+1) + 2/(s+3).

So putting it all together, F(s) is 2 + 3/(s+1) + 2/(s+3).

Now, I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s). Let's do that term by term.

The inverse Laplace transform of 2 is 2δ(t), since δ(t) is the unit impulse function, and its Laplace transform is 1. So 2 times δ(t) gives 2δ(t).

For the terms 3/(s+1) and 2/(s+3), those are standard forms. The inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s+a) is e^{-at}u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function.

So, the inverse of 3/(s+1) is 3e^{-t}u(t), and the inverse of 2/(s+3) is 2e^{-3t}u(t).

Therefore, adding all the parts together, f(t) should be:

2δ(t) + 3e^{-t}u(t) + 2e^{-3t}u(t).

Wait a minute, I should check the options. Let me look through the options again.

Option B is 2δ(t) + (3e^-t + 2e^-3t)u(t). That looks correct because 3e^{-t} + 2e^{-3t} is multiplied by u(t).

Looking at the other options:

Option F: 2δ(t) + (3e^-t + 2e^-3t), which is missing the u(t) factor. So that's incorrect.

Option B: 2δ + (3e^-t + 2e^-3t)u(t), which matches our result.

Wait, but let me double-check the partial fractions. Did I make any mistakes there?

The original F(s) was (2s² +13s +17)/(s+1)(s+3). I did polynomial division and found 2 + (5s +11)/(denominator). Then partial fractions gave me 3/(s+1) and 2/(s+3). So that seems correct.

So the final f(t) is 2δ(t) +3e^{-t}u(t) + 2e^{-3t}u(t), which matches option B.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option B is 2δ(t) + (3e^-t + 2e^-3t)u(t), which is what I have.

Wait, but another thing: did I correctly compute the partial fractions? Let me double-check:

Setting up 5s +11 = C(s+3) + D(s+1).

Expanding: Cs + 3C + Ds + D = (C+D)s + (3C + D).

Setting equal to 5s +11:

C+D=5  
3C + D =11.

Subtracting first equation from the second: 2C=6 → C=3.

Then D=5 -3=2. So yes, correct.

So the conclusion is option B.

To evaluate \( f(t) \) given \( F(s) = \frac{2s^2 + 13s + 17}{(s+1)(s+3)} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Polynomial Division**: Divide the numerator \( 2s^2 + 13s + 17 \) by the denominator \( (s+1)(s+3) = s^2 + 4s + 3 \). The division yields \( 2 + \frac{5s + 11}{s^2 + 4s + 3} \).

2. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**: Decompose \( \frac{5s + 11}{(s+1)(s+3)} \) into simpler fractions:
   \[
   \frac{5s + 11}{(s+1)(s+3)} = \frac{C}{s+1} + \frac{D}{s+3}
   \]
   Solving for \( C \) and \( D \), we find \( C = 3 \) and \( D = 2 \). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{5s + 11}{(s+1)(s+3)} = \frac{3}{s+1} + \frac{2}{s+3}
   \]

3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: Combine the results:
   \[
   F(s) = 2 + \frac{3}{s+1} + \frac{2}{s+3}
   \]
   The inverse Laplace transforms are:
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{2\} = 2\delta(t), \quad \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{3}{s+1}\right\} = 3e^{-t}u(t), \quad \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{2}{s+3}\right\} = 2e^{-3t}u(t)
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   f(t) = 2\delta(t) + 3e^{-t}u(t) + 2e^{-3t}u(t)
   \]

4. **Matching Options**: The correct expression is \( 2\delta(t) + (3e^{-t} + 2e^{-3t})u(t) \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
