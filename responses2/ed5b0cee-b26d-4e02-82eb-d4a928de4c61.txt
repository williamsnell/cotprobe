Okay, so I've got this question about group theory, specifically homomorphic images and factor groups. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, I need to understand what each statement is saying. 

Statement 1 says, "Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G." Hmm, I remember that a homomorphic image is the image of G under a homomorphism, right? And a factor group (or quotient group) is when you take a group and divide it by one of its normal subgroups, getting a new group. 

Wait, homomorphic images aren't necessarily the same as factor groups. Because a homomorphism can collapse G into a smaller group, but it doesn't have to be exactly a factor group. For example, consider a group G and a normal subgroup N. The factor group G/N is a homomorphic image of G. But the homomorphic image might not be exactly G/N; it could be a quotient that's not necessarily the full factor group. Or could it be? Wait, no, if you have a homomorphism φ: G→H, then the image is a subgroup of H. But H could be a homomorphic image, but if H is another group, maybe the image isn't necessarily a factor group. So, can every homomorphic image be a factor group? No, because the image could be any subgroup, not necessarily a factor group. So Statement 1 is false. Because not every image is a factor group. For example, if G is cyclic of order 4, and you take the image of the quotient by the subgroup generated by an element of order 2. The image is cyclic of order 2, but the factor group would be of order 2 as well. Wait, maybe this example isn't the best. Let me think of a different approach. 

Another way: the image of G under a homomorphism is a homomorphic image, but it's a group H, which may or may not be a factor group of G. So Statement 1 is false because it's not every homomorphic image is a factor group of G. 

Now, Statement 2 says, "The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G." Wait, does that mean their sets are the same, except for isomorphism? Or are they identical except for structure? No, actually, Statement 2 is saying that all homomorphic images are isomorphic to factor groups, but that doesn't make sense because homomorphic images can be different, not isomorphic. Because homomorphic images are groups, and factor groups are different if the normal subgroup is different. So for example, take G = S3 (symmetric group on 3 elements). The factor groups are the ones where you mod out by different normal subgroups. The normal subgroups of S3 are the trivial group, A3 (the alternating group), and S3 itself. So the factor groups would be S3/A3 (which is cyclic of order 2), A3/A3 (trivial group), and S3/S3 (trivial group). On the other hand, homomorphic images would include, for example, the image of S3 under the sign homomorphism is C2, which is isomorphic to S3/A3. But there are other images, like the image of the trivial homomorphism is the trivial group. Wait, but factor groups include all possible factor groups, which are more than just images. So Statement 2 is also false because homomorphic images can be of different sizes and structures, not necessarily isomorphic to all factor groups. So both statements are false. 

Looking at the options, which options have both as false? Option F says the statements are equivalent and both are true. Wait, no, because both are false. So that's not F. Wait, option F says "The statements are equivalent, and both are true." But our analysis shows both are false. So the correct option would be F: False, False. Wait, no. Let me double-check. 

Wait, no. Wait, if both statements are false, the answer should be F. Because F says the statements are equivalent and both are true. But according to our analysis, both are false. So the correct choice is F: the statements are equivalent, but both are false. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 

Wait, no, the options are as follows:

A: True, True

B: False, False

C: False, can't evaluate

D: first is contradiction, second is true.

E: first is true, second is contradiction.

F: statements are equivalent, both are true.

H: False, True.

I: True, statements can't be evaluated.

J: True, False.

So, in our case, both statements are false. So the correct answer should be F: False, False. Because F says the statements are equivalent and both are true. But that's not correct because both are false. Wait, wait, no. Because the options are about each statement's truth. So if both statements are false, the answer is F.

Wait, but wait, the user's question is about whether the statements are equivalent. So if both are false, the statements are not equivalent because they are both false, so the equivalence is not applicable. So, the answer is F: both are false.

Wait, but looking back, option F says the statements are equivalent, but both are true. That's not correct because both are false. So, the correct option is F.
</think>

The analysis of the statements leads us to conclude that both statements are false. Therefore, the correct answer is F: The statements are equivalent, and both are false.

**Answer: F**
