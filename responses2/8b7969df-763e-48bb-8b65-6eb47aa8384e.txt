Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about the function of "standard-setting in human rights diplomacy." Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what standard-setting means in this context. I know that "standard-setting" usually refers to the process of establishing or defining standards, often for the purpose of regulation or evaluation. In the context of human rights, these standards would be criteria used to assess or evaluate human rights-related actions or treaties.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Standard-setting means setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties. Hmm. So it's about the standards used to evaluate human rights treaties. But I'm not sure if that's the main function, because the question is about the function of standard-setting, not just its role within treaties.

Option B: Standard-setting means putting forward both binding and non-binding legal standards. That sounds a bit more complex. I'm not totally sure what "both" implies. It might mean that they're considering both types of standards, but I'm not certain if that's the primary function.

Option C: Standard-setting means putting forward non-binding legal standards. Wait, non-binding? So these are standards that don't have legal effect. But I think the main purpose of standard-setting is to create a framework or set criteria that can be legally applied, making them binding. So if it's non-binding, that might not be the function.

Option D: Standard-setting means enforcing human rights treaties. That doesn't sound right. Enforcing treaties would involve acting on them, but standard-setting is about setting the rules, not enforcing.

Option E: Standard-setting means establishing a set of universal human rights principles. I don't think that's the case. These principles are more about the concepts themselves, not the standards derived from them.

Option F: Standard-setting means merely proposing binding legal standards. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. If it's just proposing, then the function might be incomplete. Maybe it's more than that.

Option G: Standard-setting means proposing non-binding legal standards. So they're creating a set of standards that aren't legally enforceable. But I think the function is more about creating a framework to evaluate human rights actions.

Option H: Standard-setting means putting forward binding legal standards. Oh, I think that's a strong candidate. The purpose of standard-setting is to establish clear, legally binding criteria for assessing human rights. So these standards would be binding, allowing for legal action against violations.

Option I: Standard-setting means proposing certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties. That's similar to A, but it's about conduct rather than just standards. It might be part of it, but perhaps the primary function is about the standards themselves, not the conduct.

Option J: Standard-setting means creating guidelines for human rights diplomacy. Creating guidelines could imply more than just setting standards; it might involve their application. But standard-setting is more about the criteria than the application.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the function of "standard-setting." So standard-setting is the process of defining what is considered a standard in the context of human rights. These standards are meant to evaluate how human rights are being handled in treaties. So they're setting the criteria for what's acceptable or not.

Looking at the options, option H says it's putting forward binding legal standards. That fits because standard-setting is about creating legally binding criteria that can be used to assess actions. So if a human rights treaty has standards, these are binding, meaning they can be enforced or used to evaluate the treaties.

Option B says both binding and non-binding. I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe the standards are meant to be binding, but sometimes they might not be, depending on the situation. But the primary function is creating binding standards.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: Standard-setting means putting forward binding legal standards.

The correct answer is H: Standard-setting means putting forward binding legal standards. These standards are used to evaluate human rights-related actions in treaties, providing a framework for legal and ethical assessment. 

Answer: H
