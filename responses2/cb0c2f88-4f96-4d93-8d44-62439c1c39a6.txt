Alright, so I've got this problem here about calculating the interest charge on a $600 loan at 6% for 60 days. And then I need to find the total amount due. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that interest on a loan can be calculated in a few different ways depending on the method. There's simple interest, compound interest, maybe something else. But since the question doesn't specify, I think it's probably referring to simple interest. But wait, sometimes there's a different way, like using the actual number of days divided by the number of days in a year, which is called the exact interest method. I should probably consider both possibilities.

Wait, no, the question is about a $600 loan. The principal is $600. The rate is 6% per period, which is 60 days. The time period here is 60 days. So the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T. Where I is interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time.

So, using simple interest: I = 600 * 0.06 * (60/365). Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the time is 60 days. So is the time 60/365 of a year? Because in simple interest, the time is usually expressed as a fraction of a year. So 60/365 would be the exact time. Alternatively, if it's using the exact number of days divided by 360, that's another way, but that depends on the convention. Oh, wait, in some cases, people use 360 days for the year when calculating interest, especially for loans, to make it easier.

Wait, the problem says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the answer options are letters, and the last letter is the one I choose. But the question is about the interest and the total amount due. Let me think.

So the interest is calculated as:

I = P * R * T

Where:
P = $600
R = 6% per annum, so 6/100 = 0.06
T = 60 days, but the time in years is 60/365.

Wait, but sometimes people use 360 days in a year for such calculations, like in some bank interest rules. Let me think: If the interest is calculated using the 360-day method, then T would be 60/360. Alternatively, if it's 365 days, then T is 60/365.

So which one is correct here? The question doesn't specify. But I think for most problems like this, especially when it's a loan, they use either 360 or 365. Wait, let me think about the exact methods.

The problem is about the total amount due. Hmm. So, the interest calculation can vary. Let's compute both scenarios.

First, using 365 days:

I = 600 * 0.06 * (60/365)
I = 600 * 0.06 * (60/365) = 600 * 0.06 * approximately 0.164384 (since 60/365 is about 0.164384)
So 600 * 0.06 is 36. Then 36 * 0.164384 is about 5.917. So approximately $5.92 in interest.

Total amount due would be 600 + 5.92 = $605.92. So about $606.00. Looking at the options, option E is $606.

But wait, another approach: some banks use 360 days. So in that case, T would be 60/360 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1666667.

I = 600 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 600 * 0.06 * 0.1666667.

600 * 0.06 is 36. 36 * 0.1666667 is 6. So total interest is $6.00, making the total amount due $606.00. So same as before.

Wait, but both methods give the same result here. Either way, the interest is $6, so the total is $606.

But wait, in some methods, the time is calculated as 60/365, which gives the same as 60/360, because 60/360 is 1/6, and 60/365 is approximately 0.164384, which is close to 1/6 (0.1666667), but not exactly. Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 60/365 is equal to 12/73 ≈ 0.164384.

1/6 is about 0.1666667.

So 60/365 is approximately 0.164384, which is about 0.164384, and 1/6 is 0.1666667. So for 60 days, the exact calculation would be 60/365.

Wait, but let me calculate the interest precisely.

I = 600 * 0.06 * (60/365) = 600 * 0.06 = 36; 36 * (60/365) = 36 * 60 / 365 = 2160 / 365.

Let me compute 2160 ÷ 365.

What's 365 * 5 is 1825, so 2160 - 1825 = 335. 365 * 0.92 = approx 335. So 5 + 0.92 = 5.92. So total interest is $5.92, totaling $605.92, so approximately $606. So option E.

Wait, but in another approach, using 360 days: 60/360 = 1/6. So 600 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 600 * 0.06 = 36; 36 * (1/6) = 6. So $6 interest, total $606.

So using either method, the interest is $6, total is $606. So the answer is E: $606.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is $606. So that's the total due.

The interest on a $600 loan at 6% for 60 days is calculated using simple interest, which results in $6 due. The total amount due is $606.
