Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the molar mass of a monoprotic weak acid. Hmm, wait, what's a monoprotic acid? Oh right, it's an acid that can donate one proton (H+) when it dissociates. So the formula would be HA, where A- is the conjugate base.

The problem says that 26.3 mL of 0.122 M KOH neutralizes 0.682 grams of the acid. KOH is a strong base, so it'll react completely with the acid. Since it's a monoprotic acid, the reaction should be HA + KOH → K A + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1 between the acid and KOH.

First, I think I need to find the moles of KOH used. Moles are calculated by Molarity × Volume. But wait, the volume is in milliliters, so I'll have to convert that to liters. So 26.3 mL is 0.0263 L.

Moles of KOH = 0.122 M * 0.0263 L. Let me calculate that. 0.122 multiplied by 0.0263. Let me see: 0.122 * 0.02 is 0.00244, and 0.122 * 0.0063 is about 0.0007746. Adding those gives approximately 0.0032146 moles of KOH. Maybe I'll keep it as 0.003215 moles for more precision.

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of HA (the acid) should also be 0.003215 moles. Now, to find the molar mass, I need to divide the mass of the acid by the moles. The mass given is 0.682 grams.

So molar mass = mass / moles = 0.682 g / 0.003215 mol. Let me compute that. 0.682 divided by 0.003215. Let me do the division. Hmm, 0.682 / 0.003215. Let's see, 0.003215 is approximately 3.215e-3. 0.682 is 6.82e-1.

Dividing 6.82e-1 by 3.215e-3: (6.82 / 3.215) * (1e-1 / 1e-3) = (approx 2.12) * 1e2 = 212. So around 212 g/mol.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Alternatively, 0.682 / 0.003215 = ?

Another way: 0.003215 * 200 = 0.643. That's 0.643 grams. 0.682 is a little more, so 200 gives 0.643; the difference is 0.039 grams. So 0.039 / 0.003215 ≈ 12.1. So total is about 212.1 g/mol. So 212 g/mol is the molar mass.

Looking at the options: Option C is 212 g/mol. So that's the answer. But wait, what if I made a mistake in the stoichiometry? I assumed 1 mole of acid reacts with 1 mole of KOH. Since KOH is a strong base and the acid is monoprotic, that's correct. So the ratio is 1:1. So yes, the molar mass calculation seems right.
</think>

To determine the molar mass of the monoprotic weak acid, we start by analyzing the reaction between the acid (HA) and KOH. Since KOH is a strong base and the acid is monoprotic, the reaction is:

\[
\text{HA} + \text{KOH} \rightarrow \text{KA} + \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

The stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1, meaning one mole of the acid reacts with one mole of KOH. The problem provides the following data:

- Volume of KOH: \( 26.3 \, \text{mL} = 0.0263 \, \text{L} \)
- Molarity of KOH: \( 0.122 \, \text{M} \)
- Mass of the acid: \( 0.682 \, \text{g} \)

First, calculate the moles of KOH:

\[
\text{Moles of KOH} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.122 \, \text{M} \times 0.0263 \, \text{L} = 0.003215 \, \text{mol}
\]

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of the acid (HA) are also \( 0.003215 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, calculate the molar mass of the acid using the formula:

\[
\text{Molar Mass} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Moles}} = \frac{0.682 \, \text{g}}{0.003215 \, \text{mol}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Molar Mass} \approx 212 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Thus, the molar mass of the monoprotic weak acid is approximately \( 212 \, \text{g/mol} \), which corresponds to option C.
