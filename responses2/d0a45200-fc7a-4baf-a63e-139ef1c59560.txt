Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about determining the molecular formula of a gaseous compound that's made from boron and hydrogen. The given data is one gram of this compound occupies 0.820 liters at 1.00 atm and 276 K. Oh wait, wait, I'm a bit rusty on these gas laws, but I'll try to recall.

First, I remember that at constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is proportional to the amount of substance. Oh right, Avogadro's law. So, the number of moles n is equal to volume divided by molar volume. But wait, I don't remember the molar volume at those conditions. Oh right, the ideal gas law might help here. PV = nRT. So n = PV/(RT). 

Wait, but I don't know the molar volume at 1 atm and 276 K. That's a bit tricky. Alternatively, I can use the ideal gas equation to find n. Because I know P, V, R, and T.

Given: V = 0.820 L, P = 1.00 atm, R is the gas constant. Let me think about the units. R is usually 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Oh right, so R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So, n = PV/(RT) = (1.00 atm)(0.820 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 276 K). Let me calculate that. 

First, calculate the denominator: 0.0821 * 276. Let me compute that. 0.0821 * 276. Hmm. 0.08 * 276 is 22.08, and 0.0021*276 is about 0.5796. So approximately 22.66. So denominator is about 22.66 L·atm/(mol).

So numerator is 0.820 L. So n = 0.820 / 22.66 ≈ 0.0361 moles. Wait, let me do that more accurately. Let me compute 0.820 * 1000 = 820 L·atm. So 820 / (0.0821 * 276) = 820 / (22.66) ≈ 36.14 moles? Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.820 L is the volume, so n = (1 * 0.820) / (0.0821 * 276) → let me compute denominator again. 0.0821 * 276 = let's compute 276 * 0.08 is 22.08. 276 * 0.0021 is 0.5796. So sum is 22.66. So 0.820 / 22.66 is approximately 0.0361 moles.

So n ≈ 0.0361 mol.

But wait, the problem states that this is one gram of the compound. So we can find the molar mass from the mass and moles. Molar mass M = mass / moles. So M = 1.00 g / 0.0361 mol ≈ 27.7 g/mol.

Wait, boron has an atomic weight of 10.8 g/mol, hydrogen is 1.0. So the molar mass of the compound is the sum of the boron and hydrogen atoms. Let me call the molecular formula as BxHy. So M = 10.8x + y*(1.0) = 27.7 g/mol.

So 10.8x + y = 27.7.

But we have two variables (x and y) and only one equation. Hmm. So we need another equation. Oh wait, but the problem gives the size of the gas—wait, perhaps stoichiometric ratios can help. Because the problem is about the formula of the compound, which is a pure boron-hydrogen compound, so perhaps the molar mass is known, and we can find x and y.

Wait, but let's think about the possible options. The options are various combinations of B and H. Let me see:

The options are:

A: B6H6 → Molar mass = 6*10.8 +6*1 = 64.8 +6=70.8 g/mol → way higher than 27.7 → so not this.

B: B3H6 → 3*10.8 +6*1 =32.4 +6=38.4 → higher than 27.7.

C: BH3 → 10.8 +3= 13.8 → No.

D: B4H10 →4*10.8=43.2 +10=53.2 → No.

E: B2H4 →21.6 +4=25.6. Hmm, 25.6 is close to 27.7. But wait, 25.6 is just a bit below, but maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

Wait, no, 2 *10.8 is 21.6, plus 4 is 25.6. So 25.6 is less than 27.7. Hmm. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Wait, but 27.7 is about 27.7. So our calculated M is 27.7. So none of the options except E and maybe another have 27.7.

Wait, wait, let's compute E's molar mass: B2H4. Boron is 10.8, so 2*10.8=21.6, H is 1, 4 H's →4. So 25.6. Hmm, which is less than 27.7.

Option F: B2H6 → 2*10.8=21.6 +6 → 27.6. Oh wait, 27.6 is close to 27.7. Oh! So 27.6 is very close to 27.7, perhaps it's a typo or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let's recalculate: 10.8 * 2 is 21.6. 6 H is 6. So 21.6 +6 = 27.6 g/mol. Oh, that's very close to the calculated molar mass of 27.7. So option F is B2H6, which has molar mass 27.6. So the molecular formula must be B2H6.

But wait, wait, but the options include D as B4H10 → which is 43.2 +10=53.2, which is way higher than 27.7, so that's not it. So the correct option is F, B2H6.

Wait, but wait, the initial calculation for n: I had n=0.0361 mol. M = 1.00 / 0.0361 ≈ 27.7.

So the molar mass is 27.7 g/mol. Let me see if any of the options have a molar mass near 27.7.

Looking at the options:

Option B: B3H6 → 38.4 → no.

Option F: B2H6 → 27.6 → yes. So the molar mass is 27.6, which is very close to 27.7, so that's the one.

So the molecular formula is B2H6, which is option F.

Wait, but wait, another approach. Perhaps the ideal gas law is not the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps using the ideal gas law to calculate the moles and then the molar mass.

Wait, let's think again. The volume is 0.820 L. The temperature is 276 K, pressure 1 atm.

Using PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT) → P is 1 atm, V is 0.820 L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T is 276 K.

So n= (1 * 0.820) / (0.0821 * 276) → let me compute denominator: 0.0821 * 276 → 0.0821 * 200 =16.42; 0.0821 *76 =6.2396 → sum is 22.6596.

So n≈0.820 / 22.6596 ≈ 0.03607 mol.

Molar mass M = 1.00 g / 0.03607 mol ≈ 27.7 g/mol.

So having M ≈27.7, so looking at the options, only option F (B2H6) has M ≈27.6, which is very close.

So the correct answer is F.
</think>

To determine the molecular formula of the gaseous compound, we start by calculating the number of moles of the compound using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \). The given values are:

- \( P = 1.00 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( V = 0.820 \, \text{L} \)
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)
- \( T = 276 \, \text{K} \)

Rearranging the ideal gas law to solve for \( n \), we get:

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{(1.00)(0.820)}{(0.0821)(276)} = \frac{0.820}{22.6596} \approx 0.03607 \, \text{mol}
\]

The mass of the compound is given as 1.00 g. The molar mass \( M \) of the compound is then:

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{moles}} = \frac{1.00}{0.03607} \approx 27.7 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Next, we consider the possible molecular formulas of boron compounds (B) and hydrogen (H) and calculate their molar masses:

- **Option A: \( \text{B}_6\text{H}_6 \)**  
  \( M = 6(10.8) + 6(1) = 64.8 + 6 = 70.8 \, \text{g/mol} \) (too high)

- **Option B: \( \text{B}_3\text{H}_6 \)**  
  \( M = 3(10.8) + 6(1) = 32.4 + 6 = 38.4 \, \text{g/mol} \) (too high)

- **Option C: \( \text{BH}_3 \)**  
  \( M = 10.8 + 3(1) = 13.8 \, \text{g/mol} \) (too low)

- **Option D: \( \text{B}_4\text{H}_{10} \)**  
  \( M = 4(10.8) + 10(1) = 43.2 + 10 = 53.2 \, \text{g/mol} \) (too high)

- **Option E: \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_4 \)**  
  \( M = 2(10.8) + 4(1) = 21.6 + 4 = 25.6 \, \text{g/mol} \) (too low)

- **Option F: \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_6 \)**  
  \( M = 2(10.8) + 6(1) = 21.6 + 6 = 27.6 \, \text{g/mol} \) (very close to 27.7, matching the calculated molar mass)

- **Option G: \( \text{B}_{10}\text{H}_{14} \)**  
  \( M = 10(10.8) + 14(1) = 108 + 14 = 122 \, \text{g/mol} \) (way too high)

- **Option H: \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_2 \)**  
  \( M = 2(10.8) + 2(1) = 21.6 + 2 = 23.6 \, \text{g/mol} \) (too low)

- **Option J: \( \text{B}_5\text{H}_9 \)**  
  \( M = 5(10.8) + 9(1) = 54 + 9 = 63 \, \text{g/mol} \) (too high)

The calculated molar mass of 27.7 g/mol matches most closely with **Option F: \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_6 \)**, which has a molar mass of 27.6 g/mol. Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is \( \text{B}_2\text{H}_6 \).
