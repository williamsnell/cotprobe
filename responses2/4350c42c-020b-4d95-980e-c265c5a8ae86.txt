Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with hydraulics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The problem says: A water pump motor has a horsepower rating of 11.3 horsepower. It pumps water from a well at a rate of 1 cubic foot per second. The weight density of water is given as 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. We need to find the maximum depth of the well, neglecting friction. The options are A through J, with various feet numbers.

Hmm, I remember that horsepower is a unit of power. So, power is energy per unit time. The formula for power (P) is P = work done (energy) divided by time. So, P = W/t. 

Work done here is the force applied multiplied by the distance moved. So, work done is force times distance. But the force here is the weight of the water being pumped. The weight density is given as 62.4 lb/ft³, which I think is weight per volume. So, for a volume of 1 ft³, the weight is 62.4 pounds. 

Wait, but power is in horsepower. I think I need to convert horsepower to watts because the standard unit for power in these calculations is usually in watts. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the units involved.

Power (P) is in horsepower (hp). I recall that 1 horsepower is approximately 746 watts. So, 11.3 hp would be 11.3 multiplied by 746 watts. Let me calculate that. 11.3 * 746 = let's see. 10 * 746 is 7460, and 1.3 *746 is about 969.8. So total is 7460 +969.8 = 8429.8 watts. So, P ≈ 8400 watts.

Wait, but let's go step by step. The formula is P = (force) * (velocity). The force here is the weight of the water, which is 62.4 lb. But wait, the units for power are in foot-pounds per second, because power is work (force times distance) over time. So, perhaps I should use the formula P = (force in lb) * (velocity in ft/s) / (32.2 ft/s²), because the pound is a unit of force, and to get energy (in foot-pounds), you multiply by distance divided by g (which is approx 32.174 ft/s²). 

Wait, another approach. Work done is force (in pounds) times distance (in feet), and power is work per second. So, power (in ft-lb/s) would be (force in lb) * (velocity in ft/s) / 32.2 (since F=ma, and work is F*d, but power is F*v, which is (m a) v, but m a is F, so it's F*v. But to convert F to force in poundals, wait, no—probably better to use the formula directly in appropriate units.

So, the formula I think I should use is:

Power = (Weight density) * (Velocity) / (32.2)

Where Weight density is in lb/ft³, velocity in ft/s, and Power in horsepower multiplied by 746 watts per horsepower.

Wait, let me clarify the units properly. The formula for power when dealing with weight density would be:

Power (in ft-lb/s) = (Weight density in lb/ft³) * (Velocity in ft/s) * (1/32.2 ft/s²)

Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again.

Weight density is weight per volume, which is mass per volume times g. So, weight density (w) = ρ * g. But for the equation, since we're dealing with force, w is in lb/ft³, which is the same as (pound-force) per cubic foot.

So, power (P) is work done per second. Work is force (lb) times distance (ft), so it's lb*ft/s. But to convert that to foot-pounds per second, it's okay. 

But since the formula for power is P = (Force) * (Velocity) / (g), because Power = (F * d) / t = F * v (since v = d/t). But F is in lb, d is in ft, so F*d is lb*ft, which is a unit of work (foot-pounds). So, F = lb, velocity v in ft/s, so P (ft-lb/s) = F * v / g.

Wait, but 32.2 ft/s² is approximately the standard gravity (g). So, the equation becomes P = (F * v) / g. 

But in this case, F is the weight of the water pumped, which is 62.4 lb. Since the flow rate is 1 ft³/s, the volume flow rate is 1 ft³/s. So, the mass flow rate would be density (62.4 lb/ft³) multiplied by velocity (ft/s) because density is mass per volume. So, mass flow rate (lb/s) = density (lb/ft³) * velocity (ft/s) = 62.4 * v.

But wait, power is work done per second. Work done is force (lb) times distance (ft) divided by the length, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. So, the formula I'll use is:

Power (ft-lb/s) = (Weight density) * (Velocity) / g

So, Power = (62.4 lb/ft³) * v (ft/s) / 32.2 ft/s²

Wait, but that would give P in (lb * ft/s) / ft/s² = lb * s / s² → lb/s²? Wait, no, let me compute the units. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the power in horsepower and then convert to find the velocity.

Wait, let's reevaluate.

So, the horsepower is 11.3 hp. Convert that to watts: 11.3 * 746 ≈ 8400 W.

Power P = 8400 W.

Power is also equal to (weight) * velocity / g.

So, P = (62.4 lb) * v (ft/s) / 32.2 ft/s².

Wait, but wait, the units here: 62.4 lb is force, v is speed in ft/s, and g is ft/s². So, the numerator is lb * ft/s, denominator is ft/s² → (lb * ft/s) / (ft/s²) )= lb/s * s/ft → lb/s * (1/s) → lb/s². Wait, that doesn't make sense. What's the correct unit here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work in consistent units. Let me think about the equation again.

Power (W) = Work (ft-lb) / time (s). Work is force (lb) * distance (ft) → ft-lb. So, Power (ft-lb/s) = (Force * distance) / time.

But Force is in pounds, distance in feet, time in seconds. So, the unit is ft-lb/s.

But from the equation, P = (F * v) / g → where F is in lb, v in ft/s, g in ft/s².

So, substituting the units: (lb * ft/s) / (ft/s²) )= (lb * ft/s) * s/ft → lb * s / s² → lb/s → which is the same as ft-lb/s. Because 1 lb = 32.2 ft-lb per ft/s². Wait, perhaps it's better to convert lb to N.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the equation with units.

P = (F * v) / g → F is in lb, v in ft/s, g in ft/s². So, F*v is lb* (ft/s) → lb·ft/s, and dividing by g (ft/s²) gives (lb·ft/s) / (ft/s²) ) = (lb·ft/s) * s/ft → lb·s / s² → lb/s². Wait, but that can't be right because power should be in ft-lb/s.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula P = (F * v) / g → where F is in pounds, v in ft/s, g in ft/s². So, P (ft-lb/s) = (F * v) / g.

So, 8400 W is equal to (F * v)/g → F is 62.4 lb, v is in ft/s, g is 32.2 ft/s².

So, 8400 = (62.4 * v) / 32.2 → solving for v.

Let me compute that: v = (8400 * 32.2) / 62.4.

Calculate numerator first: 8400 *32.2 = ?

Let me compute that: 8400 * 30 is 252000, 8400 * 2.2 is 18480. So total is 252000 + 18480 = 270480.

So, v = 270480 / 62.4 = ?

Divide 270480 by 62.4. Let me see:

62.4 × 4300 = ?

62.4 * 4000 = 249,600.

62.4 * 300 = 18,720.

So, 4000 +300=4300 gives 249600 +18720=268320.

Subtract from 270480: 270480 -268320=2160.

Now, 2160 /62.4 = ?

62.4 *35= 2184. Oh wait, that's more than 2160.

Wait, 62.4 *35 = 2184, which is more than 2160.

So, 62.4 *34= 62.4 * 30=1872, 62.4 *4=249.6 → 1872+249.6=2121.6.

So, 34 *62.4=2121.6. 2160-2121.6=38.4.

So, 34 + (38.4/62.4) = 34 + 0.615=34.615. So approximately 34.615.

So, total velocity is 4300 +34.615 ≈ 4334.615 ft/s.

Wait, that's a very high speed, but that seems correct because in one second, the pump can move 1 cubic foot of water, so the speed would be pretty high.

But wait, that gives us the velocity. Now, the velocity of the pump is related to the depth. Because the pump has to overcome the weight of the water it's lifting. So, the pump must have enough potential energy to lift the water to the height of the well. But wait, in this case, the well is the height the pump is trying to reach. So, the potential energy per unit mass is mgh, where h is the height. The pump's power must be enough to lift that mass against gravity. 

Wait, but since the problem says to neglect friction, perhaps it's a simple case where the pump's power is used to lift the water to the height h. So, the power required to lift the water is the product of the weight (density * volume) and the height, divided by time.

Wait, but in this scenario, the pump is delivering water at a rate of 1 ft³/s. So, the volume flow rate is 1 ft³/s. The mass flow rate is 62.4 lb/s (since 62.4 lb/ft³ *1 ft³/s=62.4 lb/s).

The power required to lift the water is the product of the mass flow rate (in lb/s) and the height (h), multiplied by the gravitational acceleration (g), divided by 32.2 (since F = m*a, and a is g). Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

Power (W) = (mass flow rate) * height (ft) * g / 32.2

Wait, because Power is work per unit time. Work is force (lb) times distance (ft). So, for a given mass, work is (mass * g) * h (ft). But wait, mass flow rate is in lb/s, and g is in ft/s². So, lb/s * ft/s² * h (ft) = (lb * ft) / (s²) * h (ft) → that would be lb·ft²/s³.

But power is in watts, which is N·m/s. Since 1 N = 1 lb, and 1 m = 3.28084 ft. So, 1 N·m = (1 lb) * (3.28084 ft) → wait, no, 1 N·m is 1 J, which is kg·m²/s². Hmm, but perhaps it's better to relate lb to N.

Wait, 1 pound-force is approximately 4.44822 N. So, lb·ft is kg·m²/s² * ft → but that's getting messy. Maybe I should go back to the earlier equation.

The power required to lift the water is the rate at which gravitational potential energy is being done. The potential energy per unit mass is g*h (ft). So, the power is (mass flow rate) * g * h / 32.2 (since 1 lb = 32.2 ft·lbf/s², but I'm not sure). Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula.

Alternative approach: The power required is equal to the rate of doing work, which is the rate of lifting the water. So, the work done per unit time is (force) * (distance), and force is (mass) * g.

So, Power (W) = (mass flow rate) * g * h / 32.2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (W) = (density * volume flow rate) * g * h / 32.2.

Wait, density is 62.4 lb/ft³, volume flow rate is 1 ft³/s. So,

Power = (62.4 lb/ft³) * (1 ft³/s) * g (ft/s²) * h (ft) / 32.2 ft/s².

Wait, that would make units correct: (lb/ft³ * ft/s³ * ft) / (ft/s²) → lb * (ft/s³ * ft) → no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me compute the units:

Density is lb/ft³ → (lb)/(ft³)
Volume flow rate is ft³/s → ft³/s
g is ft/s²
h is ft.

So,

( (lb/ft³) * (ft³/s) * (ft/s²) ) * (ft) / 32.2 → 

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Maybe I should instead use the formula that relates power, weight, and velocity.

So, Power (W) = (Weight) * (Velocity) / (g).

Wait, Weight here is the weight of the water being lifted, which is density * volume * g. So, Weight = 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft³/s * g (ft/s²) → 62.4 * g lb·ft/s².

But since 1 lb·ft/s² = 1 ft·lbf/s (since 1 lbf = 1 lb·ft/s²), so Weight =62.4 * g ft·lbf/s.

Then, Power (W) = Weight * velocity (ft/s) / g → which is (62.4 g ft·lbf/s) * (v ft/s) / g → cancel out the g, so 62.4 * v ft·lbf/s.

Wait, but power is in watts, which is J/s or ft·lbf/s.

So, 62.4 * v = Power (in ft·lbf/s) → which is 8400 W.

Wait, but 1 ft·lbf is approximately 1.35582 ft·lb. So, 62.4 * v = 8400 (ft·lbf/s).

But 1 ft·lbf = 1 lb·ft/s² * s → Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's compute v.

So, 62.4 * v = 8400 → v = 8400 /62.4 ≈ 135 ft/s.

Wait, that can't be right. Because in one second, the pump can lift 1 ft³ of water 135 ft high, which is way beyond any reasonable well depth. That must mean I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, that approach might not be correct because I might have mixed up the formula. Let me try again.

Power is (Force) * (velocity) / (g). So, Power (W) = (F * v) / g.

F is the weight of the water, which is 62.4 lb × 1 ft³/s = 62.4 lb·ft/s² (since 1 lb = 32.2 ft·lbf/s²).

Wait, but that's incorrect. Wait, 1 lb is the force needed to accelerate 1 lb mass at 1 ft/s². But 1 lb = 32.2 ft·lbf/s² (since 1 lbf = 1 lb·ft/s²). So, F = 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft³/s = 62.4 lb/s².

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to compute F.

So, F = 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft³/s =62.4 lb/s².

Then, Power (W) = F * v /g → (62.4 lb/s² * v ft/s) / (32.2 ft/s²).

Wait, the units would be (lb * ft/s² * ft/s) ) / (ft/s² ) → (lb * ft²/s³) ) / (ft/s²) → No, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express all in consistent units. Let's use metric units.

So, 1 hp = 745.7 W.

11.3 hp = 11.3 *745.7 ≈ 8427 W.

Power (W) = 8427 W.

Power is also equal to (Force in N) * (velocity in m/s) / (1000) → because 1 kg = 1000 grams, 1 m =100 cm, etc.

Wait, perhaps using the formula:

Power (W) = (density * g * v) * h / (32.2 * 1000) → but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

Power (W) = (density in lb/ft³) * (velocity in ft/s) * (height in ft) / 32.2.

Wait, that makes sense. Because Power is the rate at which work is done. Work is force times distance. So, in our case, force is (density) * (volume) * g → which is (density) * (1 ft³/s) * g = (density * g) * (1 ft³/s) → which is the weight of the water. But wait, the work is force (in lb) times distance (in ft), so the work is (density * volume * g) * h.

But since density is in lb/ft³, volume is in ft³, so density * volume is lb. Then, multiplying by g and h (both in ft) gives lb*ft.

Power is work per time, so divide by time (s). So, the formula becomes:

Power (W) = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2)

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try a different approach.

Since the pump delivers 1 ft³/s of water, the mass flow rate is 62.4 lb/s.

The work required to lift this mass by a height h is (mass) * g * h → (62.4 lb/s) * (32.2 ft/s²) * h (ft).

But work is in foot-pounds, and power is in foot-pounds per second. So, the power required is (62.4 *32.2 * h ) / (32.2) → simplifying, 62.4 * h.

Wait, because the g and 32.2 cancel each other out. So, Power (W) =62.4 * h.

But wait, earlier, when I tried using F*v/g, I got a velocity of around 4334 ft/s, which seems way too high. But now, this approach says that Power =62.4 * h.

Wait, but that can't be right because the work required is (mass) * g * h → which is (62.4 lb/s) * (32.2 ft/s²) * h (ft) → (62.4 *32.2) (lb·ft/s²) * h (ft) → (lb·ft²/s²) * h (ft) → (lb·ft/s²) * h^2 → but that's not matching with power (W) which is in ft·lbf/s.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Work done (W) is force (F) times distance (d), so W = F * d (in foot-pounds). Power (W/s) is Work (ft·lbf/s) divided by time (s).

So, Power = (F * d) / t.

But in our case, F is the weight of the water being lifted. So, F = mass * g (lb × ft/s²).

The mass is 62.4 lb/s (since 62.4 lb/ft³ *1 ft³/s =62.4 lb/s).

So, F =62.4 lb/s * g (ft/s²).

So, F =62.4 * g lb·ft/s².

Then, the work done per second (Power) is F * d / t → (F * d) / t → since d is the distance in feet, t is the time in seconds.

Wait, but in this scenario, the work is being done over time. So, the Power is F * d / t.

But F is in lb·ft/s², d is in ft, t is in s. So, F * d = lb·ft²/s², and dividing by t (s) gives lb·ft²/s³. Which is not the same as power (which is in ft·lbf/s).

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm using the formula. Let me think again.

Another way to approach is to compute the potential energy per unit time (power) needed to lift the water. 

Potential energy (PE) is mass (m) * g (height) → PE = m * g * h.

Power (P) is PE / t → (m * g * h) / t.

But since m is in lb/s (mass flow rate), and t is 1s, (m * g * h) / t → (lb/s * ft/s² * ft) / 1s → (lb·ft²/s³) / 1 → which is the same as ft·lbf/s.

So, putting it all together, P = (m * g * h) / t → but m is in lb/s, g in ft/s², h in ft, t in s.

So, P = ( (lb/s) * (ft/s²) * ft ) / s → (lb·ft²/s³) / s → Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of it in terms of the formula.

The correct formula for the power required to lift water is:

Power = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Power = (density * volume flow rate * g * h) / (32.2).

Wait, but no, that's not correct. Let me think about dimensional analysis.

Power has units of watts, which is kg·m²/s³.

Density has units of kg/m³.

Volume flow rate has units of m²/s.

Height h has units of m.

So, putting it all together:

density (kg/m³) * volume flow rate (m²/s) * g (m/s²) * h (m) → (kg/m³) * (m²/s) * (m/s²) * m → (kg·m³)/(s³·m³) ) → kg/(s³) → but that's not matching with power.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the g in the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's:

Power = (density) * (volume flow rate) * (g) * (h) / (32.2).

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about it.

Another approach: The power required is equal to the rate at which gravitational potential energy is being done. The potential energy is mgh. So, the rate is (mgh) / t → (m * g * h) / t.

But m is mass flow rate, which is in lb/s. So, (lb/s) * (ft/s²) * ft → (lb·ft²/s³) → which would be ft·lbf/s, but that's not correct. Wait, because 1 lbf = 1 lb·ft/s² → so, lb·ft/s² = lbf.

So, (lb/s) * (ft/s²) * ft = (lb/s) * (ft²/s²) → (lb·ft²)/s³ → which is not the same as ft·lbf/s.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me try to compute the units step by step.

Density: kg/m³.

Volume flow rate: m²/s.

g: m/s².

Height: m.

So, putting it all together:

Density * volume flow rate * g * height = (kg/m³) * (m²/s) * (m/s²) * m → (kg * m² * m) / (m³ * s * s²) ) → (kg·m³)/(m³) → kg → Wait, that's not right. No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the exponents wrong. Let me compute the exponents:

kg * m² * m / (m³ * s * s²) → kg * m^4 / (m³ * s^3) → kg * m / s^3.

Which is (kg·m)/s³ → which is (kg·m)/(s³). But power is in kg·m/s³. So, this is correct—so the units of the expression (density * volume flow rate * g * h) are kg·m/s³, which is same as power.

So, the correct formula for the power is:

Power (W) = (density * volume flow rate * g * h) / (32.08).

Wait, but no, perhaps it's better to not divide but to calculate it directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (W) = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

But I'm not certain. Let me think of another approach.

Let me use the formula:

Power (W) = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Power (W) = (density * volume flow rate * g) * h / (32.2).

So, let's plug in the numbers.

density = 62.4 lb/ft³.

volume flow rate = 1 ft³/s.

g = 32.2 ft/s².

h is what we're trying to find.

So,

Power (W) = (62.4 lb/ft³) * (1 ft³/s) * (32.2 ft/s²) * h (ft) / (32.2).

Wait, that would simplify to 62.4 * h (ft) → but we know that Power is 8400 W.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the units would be (lb/ft³) * (ft³/s) * (ft/s²) * ft → (lb·ft) / s² → which is not matching with power in W.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the units. Let me compute the units correctly.

Each term:

62.4 (lb/ft³) → lb/(ft³)

1 (ft³/s) → ft³/s

32.2 (ft/s²) → ft/s²

h (ft) → ft

So, multiplying all together:

lb/(ft³) * ft³/s * ft/s² * ft → (lb * ft) / s³.

But power is in lb·lbf/s → which is (lb * ft²/s³) → So, units don't match. So, perhaps the formula isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (W) = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

Wait, but that would make units (lb/ft³) * (ft/s²) * h (ft) * (ft³/s) → (lb * ft) / (s²) * h * (ft³/s) → (lb * ft * ft³) ) / (s² * s) → (lb * ft^4) ) / s^3 → which is not correct. I'm way off.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the power is the rate at which gravitational potential energy is being done. The potential energy per unit mass is g*h (ft/s² * ft) → which is ft·lbf/s.

So, power is (g*h) [ft·lbf/s] multiplied by the mass flow rate (lb/s). So, Power (W) = (g*h) * (mass flow rate) / (32.2).

Wait, but that would be (ft·lbf/s) * (lb/s) ) / (32.2) → which is (lb·ft) / s² → which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Power (W) = (g * h * mass_flow_rate) / (32.2).

So, substituting the numbers:

g = 32.2 ft/s².

h = ?

mass_flow_rate = 62.4 lb/s.

So,

Power (W) = (32.2 ft/s² * h * 62.4 lb/s ) / 32.2 → simplify.

32.2 cancels out, so:

Power (W) = 62.4 * h * (ft/s² * lb/s) → but this is still unclear.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula:

Power (W) = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

Wait, but then:

density = 62.4 lb/ft³.

g = 32.2 ft/s².

h = ?

volume flow rate = 1 ft³/s.

So,

Power = (62.4 lb/ft³) * (32.2 ft/s²) * h (ft) * (1 ft³/s) / (32.2).

Wait, but that still leaves (lb·ft) / s², which is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is:

Power (W) = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

But I'm not getting the units right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

Power (W) = (density * volume flow rate * g * h) / (32.2).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the formula in terms of the units of power.

Power (W) = (kg·m²/s³) → which is correct.

So, let's compute the units of the formula:

density (kg/m³) * volume flow rate (m²/s) * g (m/s²) * h (m) → (kg/m³) * (m²/s) * (m/s²) * m → (kg * m^4) / (m³ * s^3) ) → (kg·m)/s³ → which is kg·m/s³ → which is same as power. So, units are correct.

So, the formula is correct, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the numerical value.

Let me compute the numerical value.

density = 62.4 lb/ft³.

volume flow rate = 1 ft³/s.

g = 32.2 ft/s².

h is the depth in ft.

So, according to the formula:

Power (W) = (density * volume flow rate * g * h) / (32.2).

We know that Power is 8400 W.

So,

8400 = (62.4 * 1 * 32.2 * h) / 32.2.

Simplify.

8400 = (62.4 * 32.2 * h) / 32.2.

The 32.2 cancels out.

8400 = 62.4 * h.

So, h = 8400 /62.4 → let's compute that.

62.4 × 135 = 8424 → which is more than 8400.

Wait, 62.4 × 135 = 62.4 ×100=6240, 62.4×35=2184 → total 6240+2184=8424.

But we have 8400, so 8400 is 24 less than 8424.

So, 62.4 × x =8400 → x=8400/62.4.

Let me compute that.

62.4 × 135 =8424.

So, 62.4 × (135 - (24/62.4)) )=8400.

24/62.4=0.3846.

So, x=135 -0.3846=134.6154.

So, h ≈134.615 ft.

Wait, that's a very deep well. But according to this calculation, it's correct.

But wait, the formula I used assumes that:

Power = (density * g * h) * volume_flow_rate / (32.2).

But according to the earlier approach, where Power =62.4 * h, which is also incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Let me think again: the correct formula should be Power = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

But wait, in our previous approach, when I used Power = (density * g * h) * volume_flow_rate / (32.2), I got the same result as Power = density * volume_flow_rate * g * h /32.2.

Wait, but that's because in the previous approach, I was using the formula Power = density * g * h * volume_flow_rate divided by 32.2.

Wait, but in this approach, I'm getting that Power = (density * volume_flow_rate * g * h) /32.2.

But perhaps I'm getting confused between the two approaches.

Wait, let me try to do a simple calculation.

Using the formula:

Power = (density * g * h) * volume_flow_rate / (32.2).

We have:

density=62.4 lb/ft³.

g=32.2 ft/s².

volume_flow_rate=1 ft³/s.

Power=8400 W.

So,

8400 = (62.4 *32.2 * h *1 ) /32.2.

Simplify denominator: 32.2.

So,

8400 = (62.4 *32.2 * h ) /32.2.

The 32.2 cancels out.

8400=62.4 * h.

So, h=8400/62.4.

Which is 134.615 ft.

So, the depth is approximately 134.6 feet.

Wait, that's a very deep well, but according to this calculation, it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula Power = (density * g * h) * volume_flow_rate / (32.2).

But perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Power = (density * g * h) * volume_flow_rate / (32.2 * 1000).

Wait, let me try that.

So,

8400 = (62.4 *32.2 * h *1) / (32.2 *1000).

Simplify denominator: 32.2 *1000=32200.

So,

8400 = (62.4 *32.2 *h) /32200.

62.4 *32.2 = 2006.88.

So,

8400 = (2006.88 * h ) /32200.

Multiply both sides by 32200:

8400 *32200 =2006.88 *h.

Compute 8400 *32200.

Well, 8400 *32200 =8400 *322 *100.

Compute 8400 *322.

Well, 8000 *322=2,576,000.

400 *322=128,800.

So, total is 2,576,000 +128,800=2,704,800.

Multiply by 100: 2,704,800 *100=270,480,000.

So, 8400*32200=270,480,000.

So,

270,480,000 = 2006.88 *h.

So,

h=270,480,000 /2006.88.

Compute this division.

270,480,000 ÷2006.88.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, note that 2006.88 × 134,615 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to do it on a calculator, but let's do it manually.

2006.88 × x =270,480,000.

x=270,480,000 /2006.88.

Let me divide 270,480,000 by 2006.88.

First, let's write this as 270,480,000 ÷2006.88.

We can simplify by multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000: 270,480,000 *1000=270,480,000,000; 2006.88*1000=2,006,880.

So, now the division is 270,480,000,000 /2,006,880.

We can further simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 10: 27,048,000,000 /200,688.

Now, let's see how many times 200,688 fits into 27,048,000,000.

Compute 27,048,000,000 ÷200,688.

We can compute this as:

200,688 × 134,615 = ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 200,688 × 134,615.

But let's think about it:

200,688 ×100,000 =20,068,800,000.

200,688 ×34,615 =?

Wait, 200,688 ×34,615.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 200,688 ×134,615.

But perhaps I can compute it as:

200,688 ×134,615 = (200,688 ×100,000) + (200,688 ×34,615).

200,688 ×100,000 =20,068,800,000.

200,688 ×34,615: let's compute 200,688 ×30,000 =6,015, 264,000.

200,688 ×4,000=802,752,000.

200,688 ×600=120,412,800.

200,688 ×15=3,010,320.

So, adding up:

200,688 ×30,000 =6,015, 264,000.

200,688 ×4,000 =802,752,000.

200,688 ×600=120,412,800.

200,688 ×15=3,010,320.

Adding:

6,015,264,000 +802,752,000=6,817, 200, 412,800 → 6,817, 200,412,800.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just sum them all.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 200,688 ×134,615 =27,048,000,000.

If that's correct, then x=134,615.

So, h=134,615 ft.

Wait, that would mean that the well is about 134,615 feet deep.

But given that 8400 W is a very high power for a water well, perhaps it's better to double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be Power = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is Power = (density * g * h) * (volume flow rate) / (32.2).

Wait, but according to the calculation, h =134,615 ft.

But perhaps that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should have a different denominator, like 32.2 ×1000.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is

Power (W) = (density (lbm/ft³) × g (ft/s²) × h (ft) × volume_flow_rate (ft³/s)) / (32.2 × 1000).

Wait, let's try that.

So,

8400 = (62.4 *32.2 * h *1 ) / (32.2 *1000).

Simplify denominator: 32.2 *1000 =32,200.

So,

8400 = (62.4 *32.2 * h ) /32,200.

The 32.2 in numerator and denominator cancel out.

So,

8400 = (62.4 * h ) /100.

Multiply both sides by100:

8400 *100 =62.4 *h.

So,

840,000 =62.4 *h.

So,

h=840,000 /62.4.

Same as before.

h=134,615 ft.

So, the calculation holds.

Therefore, the depth of the well would be approximately 134,615 feet.

But that seems extremely deep, perhaps a well at a hydroelectric plant, but maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Power (W) = (density (lbm/ft³) × g (ft/s²) × h (ft) × volume_flow_rate (ft³/s)) / (32.2 × 1000).

Wait, but why multiply by 1000?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (W) = (density (lb/m³) × g (m/s²) × h (m) × volume_flow_rate (m³/s)) / (32.2).

Wait, but units:

Density: kg/m³ → lb/m³ = (1000 g/m³) → 1 g =0.001 kg → 1 lb =4.448222 lb/kg → 1 lb/m³ =4.448222 lb/kg / kg/m³? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula with the correct unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Power (W) = (density (lbm/ft³) × g (ft/s²) × h (ft) × velocity (ft/s)) / (32.2).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

But according to the calculation, the depth is approximately 134,615 feet.

So, the answer is approximately 134,615 feet.

But perhaps I should present the answer as 134,615 ft.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 134,600 ft.

But I'll proceed with 134,615 ft.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to double-check.

Wait, let me think again.

If I have Power = (density * g * h * volume flow rate) /32.2.

So, density=62.4 lbm/ft³.

g=32.2 ft/s².

h=?

volume flow rate=1 ft³/s.

Power=8400 W.

So,

8400 = (62.4 *32.2 * h *1 ) /32.2.

Simplify denominator:

8400 = (62.4 *32.2 * h ) /32.2.

Again, 32.2 cancels:

8400 =62.4 * h.

h=8400/62.4=134,615 ft.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the depth is approximately 134,615 feet.
</think>

The depth of the well is calculated to be approximately 134,615 feet.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Power (P) = 8400 W
   - Density (density) = 62.4 lbm/ft³
   - Volume flow rate (Q) = 1 ft³/s
   - Gravity (g) = 32.2 ft/s²

2. **Use the formula for power in a well:**
   \[
   P = \frac{\text{density} \times g \times h \times Q}{32.2}
   \]
   Where \( h \) is the depth of the well.

3. **Rearrange the formula to solve for \( h \):**
   \[
   h = \frac{P \times 32.2}{\text{density} \times g \times Q}
   \]

4. **Plug in the values:**
   \[
   h = \frac{8400 \times 32.2}{62.4 \times 32.2 \times 1}
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Notice that \( 32.2 \) appears in both numerator and denominator and cancels out.
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     h = \frac{8400}{62.4}
     \]

6. **Calculate the depth:**
   \[
   h = 134,615 \text{ feet}
   \]

**Answer:** The depth of the well is approximately 134,615 feet.
