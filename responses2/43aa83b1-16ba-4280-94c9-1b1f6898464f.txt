Okay, so I've got this question about the relationship between preadolescent siblings. Let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

First, what do I know about siblings? Siblings are usually close friends, right? They share the same parents, so they're very dependent on each other. But when they're preadolescent, does that change much? Preadolescent means they're between the ages of 12 and 16, so maybe they're still very close but perhaps a bit more independent?

I remember from school that older siblings tend to be more independent. Maybe that's because they're older and have more responsibilities. But preadolescent siblings might still be close, though not as close as if they're adults. So, their relationships might be supportive and friendly, but maybe not as close as a close group.

Looking at the options: 

A: supportive and hostile. Hmm, hostile doesn't make much sense for siblings. They just want to be around, not cause problems.

B: distant/aloof. That sounds correct. They might not be as close, and perhaps not always friendly. It's possible they have some conflicts, but maybe not as much as in younger siblings.

C: extremely close with no conflict. That's too idealistic. I think older siblings have more conflicts, so preadolescents might be more cooperative.

D: solely cooperative with no competition. Well, some may have friendly competition, but I don't think preadolescent siblings are entirely cooperative in the same way as, say, younger siblings. They might have small disagreements, but maybe not as much as in their younger years.

E: overly dependent. That's the opposite of what I thought. They're more dependent on their siblings than independent.

F: purely competitive. Again, not sure. Maybe they have some competition, but not as much as in their early years.

G: competitive and cooperative. That seems a bit conflicting. Maybe more about balance in relationships.

H: close and conflictual. That sounds plausible. They're close, but have some conflicts which makes their relationships realistic.

I: conflictual/hostile. That's not right. They're not hostile, and conflict is more likely.

J: indifferent and uninvolved. No, they're definitely involved in their family.

So putting it together, preadolescent siblings are close but have some conflicts. So the best answer would be H: close and conflictual.

The correct answer is H: close and conflictual. Preadolescent siblings are typically close friends who share responsibilities and involve each other in their daily lives, but they also experience some conflicts. 

Answer: H
