Okay, so I have this question about the Federal Reserve and their major controls. Hmm, I remember the Federal Reserve is the central bank, right? And it's responsible for managing the country's money supply and financial stability. Let me think about what they do.

Wait, the question is asking about three major controls. I think the Federal Reserve primarily uses the discount rate and the required reserve ratio. Oh, and they can adjust the money supply by buying and selling government securities in the open market. Oh, and they also have tools like the reserve requirements and the federal funds rate. But wait, the options don't include all of that. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option G, it says: "raise or lower the required reserve ratio, buy or sell bonds in the open market, raise or lower the discount rate." That sounds familiar. So the required reserve ratio affects how much banks can lend, which in turn affects the money supply. They buy and sell bonds to change the money supply. Also, the discount rate is the interest rate the bank charges for loans, so adjusting that affects the lending rates, which in turn affects the money supply.

So the three controls would be the required reserve ratio, buying/selling bonds, and the discount rate. That matches option G. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option C says "control the fiscal policy, regulate the tax rate, adjust the budget deficit." That's another major aspect, but the question is specifically about the Federal Reserve's controls.财政政策是由政府管理的，而这里的选项主要涉及中央银行的工具。

Option G is about the tools used by the Federal Reserve. The other options either mention other central banks or different areas. So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G. The Federal Reserve uses the required reserve ratio, buying/selling bonds, and adjusting the discount rate as its three primary controls. 

Answer: G
