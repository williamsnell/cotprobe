Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the motives for holding money and how they apply to different people. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the question asks about the three basic reasons: trans-actions purposes, precautionary purposes, and speculative purposes. Then, it presents three scenarios (i, ii, iii) and asks which of the options (A to J) correctly assigns these motives to each scenario. 

The options are A through J, each giving a different assignment. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling what each of these purposes means.

Trans-actions purposes, like keeping money for transactions, are probably related to immediate needs, like buying things to spend. For example, a student might hold money to pay for classes or buy snacks. That makes sense as a basic need.

Precautionary purposes are for unexpected expenses, like savings for emergencies or unexpected medical expenses. So a professor with young children would need money to cover unexpected costs, like medical visits or unexpected expenses due to their children.

Speculative purposes involve holding money to make investments or borrow money for big purchases. This is more long-term and for speculative gains. A "wheeler-dealer" is someone who deals with heavy machinery, so they might hold money to invest in stocks or other assets. That fits speculative reasons.

Now, looking at the scenarios:
i) A student on a small allowance from parents. He probably needs money for small purchases, like buying a notebook or a lunchbox. So this fits the immediate needs, which is trans-actions purposes.

ii) A financially conservative professor with young children. They might need money for unexpected travel, medical bills, or other emergencies. This fits precautionary purposes.

iii) A "wheeler-dealer." They invest in heavy machinery, so they hold money for speculative gains. This would be speculative purposes.

So, putting it together:
- Scenario i: Trans-actions purposes (transactions)
- Scenario ii: Precautionary purposes (transactions?)
Wait, no, wait. Wait, the options are i, ii, iii each assigned to one of the three motives. So i is transactions, ii is precautionary, iii is speculative. Looking at the options, option B is i: Precautionary, ii: Precautionary, iii: Transactions. Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are given as A to J, each with three choices. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: i - transactions, ii - transactions, iii - precautionary
B: i - precautionary, ii - precautionary, iii - transactions
C: i - speculative, ii - transactions, iii - precautionary
D: i - transactions, ii - speculative, iii - precautionary
E: i - transactions, ii - precautionary, iii - speculative
F: i - speculative, ii - precautionary, iii - transactions
G: i - speculative, ii - speculative, iii - precautionary
H: i - precautionary, ii - speculative, iii - transactions
I: i - precautionary, ii - transactions, iii - speculative
J: i - precautionary, ii - transactions, iii - precautionary

Wait no, wait. Wait, let me make sure. The first part of the answer options is about i, the second part about ii, and the third part about iii.

So, for each scenario (i, ii, iii), assign the correct reason.

Scenario i: student on a small allowance. He needs money for small purchases, like buying a notebook or a lunchbox. That's immediate needs, so transactions purposes.

Scenario ii: professor with young children. They're saving for unexpected expenses like medical bills or unexpected costs due to children. So that's precautionary purposes.

Scenario iii: "Wheeler-dealer" invests in heavy machinery. So they hold money to make investments, which is speculative purposes.

So the assignments are: i - transactions, ii - precautionary, iii - speculative.

Looking at the options, which one has i: transactions, ii: precautionary, iii: speculative.

Looking through the options:

Option E: i - transactions, ii - precautionary, iii - speculative. So that's option E.

Wait, let me check each option:

Option A: i - transactions, ii - transactions, iii - precautionary. No, both i and ii assigned to transactions, which is incorrect.

Option B: i - precautionary, ii - precautionary, iii - transactions. No, i and ii are wrong.

Option C: i - speculative, ii - transactions, iii - precautionary. No.

Option D: i - transactions, ii - speculative, iii - precautionary. No, ii is speculative.

Option E: i - transactions, ii - precautionary, iii - speculative. Yes, this fits.

Wait, but wait another moment. The professor with young children is on a small allowance. So they might not have much money, but they need it for unexpected expenses. That makes sense as precautionary.

Wheeler-dealer is a person who invests in machinery. So they hold money to make investments, which is speculative.

Student on a small allowance: they need money for small purchases. So transactions.

So option E is correct. But let me check all options again.

Yes, E fits. So the answer should be E.

The correct assignments are: i) transactions purposes, ii) precautionary purposes, iii) speculative purposes. This corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
