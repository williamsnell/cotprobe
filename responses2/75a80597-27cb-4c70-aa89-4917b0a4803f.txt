Question:

A manufacturer of motor oil is interested in testing the effects of a newly developed additive on the lifespan of an engine. Twenty-five different engine types are selected at random and each one is tested using oil with the additive and oil without the additive. What type of analysis will yield the most useful information?

Options:

A: Independent samples t-test for population proportions
B: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
C: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
D: Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
E: Paired t-test for population proportions
F: Independent samples comparison of population proportions
G: Matched pairs comparison of population proportions
H: Chi-square test for independence
I: Matched pairs comparison of population means
J: Independent samples comparison of population means

Okay, so I've got this question about statistical analysis for a manufacturer testing a new additive on engine lifespan. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the manufacturer is testing the effect of a new additive on engine lifespan. They used 25 different engine types. Each engine was tested with the additive and without it. So, they're looking at the lifespan difference caused by the additive.

Hmm, so the variable here is the type of engine, and the two treatments are additive and no additive. So, they're comparing two different conditions across the same set of engine types. Wait a second, so each engine is tested under both conditions. That sounds like a situation where each engine is a matched pair or a repeated measures scenario.

In statistics, when each subject (or in this case, each engine type) is tested under two different conditions, we use a matched pairs analysis. Because each engine is its own control—like a within-subjects design. So, the analysis should be a matched pairs test.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: Independent samples t-test for proportions
B: Two-way ANOVA
C: One-way ANOVA
D: Repeated measures ANOVA
E: Paired t-test for proportions
F: Independent samples comparison of proportions
G: Matched pairs comparison of proportions
H: Chi-square for independence
I: Matched pairs for means
J: Independent samples for means

So, I think option D is the repeated measures ANOVA. Alternatively, option I is the matched pairs, but I'm a bit confused between D and I. Wait, in a repeated measures (or within-subjects) design, each subject is measured under multiple conditions. Here, each engine is measured once under additive and once without. So, for each engine, two measurements. That would fit a repeated measures setup.

The two-way ANOVA (option B) applies when you have two independent variables, each with multiple levels. But in this case, we only have one independent variable (the additive presence) with two levels. So B is for two factors, not applicable.

Option C (one-way ANOVA) would apply if we had one independent variable and multiple levels, but here it's only two levels. So C is not right.

Options F and J are about proportions. But wait, the question is about comparing means, not proportions. Unless the data is binary, which it's not, I think. So F and J probably aren't the right choice.

Option G is matched pairs for proportions. Wait, but matched pairs can be for continuous data, not just proportions. So G would apply if it's a categorical variable, but here we have continuous measurements (lifespan). So maybe I is the better option.

Option I is a matched pairs test for means. That seems to fit. Because each engine is paired with itself under the two treatments. So the analysis would compare the means of the two treatments for each engine.

Wait, what's the difference between matched pairs and repeated measures? Oh, they're the same thing. So when you have the same subjects measured under different conditions, it's a matched pairs or repeated measures. In this case, each engine is a subject, and it's measured under two treatment conditions. So the correct analysis is a matched pairs test for means.

Looking back, the options are D and I. Let me think about the terminology. Repeated measures refers to the same subjects being tested under multiple conditions. Matched pairs refers to the same subjects being paired with different conditions. Oh wait, no, I think in matched pairs, the two conditions are different. So for each subject (engine), you have two measurements. That's a repeated measures design because the same subjects are being measured under different conditions.

So the analysis is a repeated measures ANOVA, which is option D. Alternatively, if it's paired samples, that's option I. But wait, in this case, each engine is treated as one subject, and each subject is measured twice (with additive and without). So it's matched pairs, which is option G or I.

Wait, no. Wait, matched pairs is when the same subject is measured under two different conditions. So for example, a before and after measurement. That's matched pairs. Here, each engine is treated as a subject, and each is measured under two conditions (additive and no additive). So it's a matched pairs setup, which would be option G or I.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify:

- Matched pairs (or repeated measures) refers to the same subjects being tested under two different conditions. So if I have 25 subjects, each tested under condition A and B, that's matched pairs.

- Matched pairs can also refer to a paired design where each subject is matched with another subject. But in this case, each subject is a separate engine, and their lifespan is measured under two conditions—so it's the same as matched pairs.

Wait, but in the options, I have "Matched pairs comparison of population means" as option I and "Matched pairs comparison of population proportions" as option G. Wait, no, looking back:

Options are:

G: Matched pairs comparison of population proportions

I: Matched pairs comparison of population means

So, in our case, the data is continuous (lifespan in hours, say), so we would compare the means, not proportions.

So the correct analysis is option I: matched pairs for means.

Alternatively, in a matched pairs scenario, the same subjects are tested under two different conditions. But in this case, each engine is a subject, and each is tested under two conditions—so it's a matched pairs design.

So the analysis is matched pairs for means. So the correct answer is I.

The manufacturer is testing the effect of a new additive on engine lifespan using 25 engine types, each tested under two conditions (with and without the additive). This design involves the same subjects (engines) being measured under two different conditions, which fits a matched pairs or repeated measures analysis. 

Analyzing the options:
- **D (Repeated measures ANOVA)** and **I (Matched pairs ANOVA)** both refer to the same concept but have slightly different terminologies. Repeated measures ANOVA is more general, while matched pairs ANOVA emphasizes pairing subjects rather than repeated measurements.
- **I** is the more precise term for this design, as it directly applies to the paired subjects.
- Other options are less applicable:
  - **C (One-way ANOVA)** is for one independent variable with multiple levels, not applicable here.
  - **D (Two-way ANOVA)** involves multiple independent variables, which is not the case here.
  - **F (Independent samples for proportions)** and **J (Independent samples for means)** do not apply to paired data.
  - **G (Matched pairs for proportions)** and **H (Chi-square)** are for categorical data, not continuous measurements.

Thus, the correct analysis is **I: Matched pairs comparison of population means**.
