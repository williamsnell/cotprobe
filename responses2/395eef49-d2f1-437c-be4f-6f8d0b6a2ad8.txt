Okay, let's try to figure out the right answer here. The question is about Ashford's argument regarding poverty and aid agencies. So, Ashford probably made a point that worrying about dependency on aid doesn't mean we should stop giving aid entirely.

Looking at the options, option E says "ignore the issue of global economic justice." Hmm, I'm not sure if that's the direct point. Ashford might have been pointing out that aid isn't the only solution and that it's about justice, not just the need for it. 

Option B is about abandoning the poor, which seems too extreme. I don't think that's Ashford's main point. Option C says aid is inherently unjust. But that might not be the strongest statement either because it's more about the nature of aid rather than the approach to address it.

Option A suggests that aid is the only solution. That doesn't seem right because aid isn't the only way people might need it. It's possible that some rely on other means, but Ashford's point is likely about not dismissing aid as a necessary tool but not dismissing it as the only solution.

Option D is about increasing aid. That doesn't directly address the issue of dependency or the ethical aspect, so I think it's not the best choice.

Option F is about forcing them to be self-sufficient. That sounds extreme and might not be Ashford's stance. He's probably more concerned with the justice and the approach.

Option I talks about a social contract approach. I'm not sure if that's the exact point, but it's a possible angle.

Option J is about abolishing aid, which is a strong negative viewpoint. But Ashford's argument is about not abandoning aid but using it correctly.

Wait, Ashford's argument is likely about not rejecting aid as a tool but understanding its limitations. So, the correct options would be ones that support the idea that aid isn't the sole solution but doesn't dismiss it. Looking back, option E says ignore the issue, which might be the opposite of what Ashford is trying to convey. The correct answer is probably E because it's about not dismissing aid as a solution but focusing on justice, not the rejection.

Alternatively, option B is about abandoning the poor. That's more about the end state, which might not be Ashford's focus. 

Wait, let me think again. Ashford's argument is probably that aid isn't the only solution but doesn't mean we should abandon it. So, the correct answer should be E or maybe another option.

Wait, option E says "ignore the issue of global economic justice." So Ashford is concerned that aid isn't being used correctly, but he's not dismissing it. He might be saying that we shouldn't abandon aid because it's not the only solution, but we should focus on justice. So option E is about ignoring the justice aspect, which is the opposite of what Ashford would say.

So, the correct answer would be E because Ashford is saying that we should not ignore the issue of justice but rather use aid correctly. Therefore, option E would suggest that we should not ignore it, which aligns with the idea that aid isn't the only solution but that it's tied to justice.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look for the exact wording.

Ashford argues that worries about dependency do not mean we should abandon aid. So, he's stating that even if we're worried about dependency, it doesn't mean we should stop giving aid. So, the statement is not that aid is the only solution, but that it's not a bad idea.

So the correct answer would be one that supports this. Looking again, option E says "ignore the issue of global economic justice." So Ashford is saying that we shouldn't ignore the issue but use aid correctly. So, the opposite of ignoring is not ignoring. So the correct answer would be E because it's the opposite of what Ashford is saying. Or is it?

Wait, no. If Ashford says that worries about dependency don't mean we should abandon aid, then the opposite would be that they do mean we should abandon aid. So, if the question is which option is NOT the correct response to his statement, the answer would be that option.

But wait, the question is, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the options are the choices, and the answer is the letter to choose, which is the correct answer.

So the question is, what does Ashford argue? He argues that worrying about dependency doesn't mean we should abandon aid. So, he's saying that aid isn't the only solution, but it's not dismissing it.

So, the options are:

E: ignore the issue of global economic justice.

So if Ashford is saying that it's not about ignoring, but about not dismissing, then E is about ignoring, which is the opposite. So E is not the correct choice, it's the opposite of what he's stating.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct in response to Ashford's argument. So, the correct answer would be the one that aligns with Ashford's reasoning.

So, the options that fit Ashford's reasoning are:

- Not dismissing aid as a solution (i.e., not saying we should abandon it), but focusing on justice.

So, looking back, the options are:

A: suggest aid is only solution.

B: abandon poor's unjust situation.

C: aid is inherently unjust.

D: increase aid.

E: ignore economic justice.

I: social contract.

J: abolish aid.

So, Ashford says that worries about dependency don't mean we should abandon aid. So he's not dismissing aid as a solution. So options A and C don't fit. B and D are about abandoning, which he's not arguing against. So his point is that aid isn't the only solution, but he's not saying we should abandon it.

So the correct options are those that support this. So, the options that fit Ashford's reasoning are E and others. E is about ignoring the issue. So, if Ashford is saying that we shouldn't abandon aid, then ignoring the issue would be the opposite. Therefore, E is the opposite of what Ashford is saying, so it's not the correct answer.

Wait, the question is "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So the options are A-J, and the answer is the letter, not the full option.

So, the correct answer is the one that matches Ashford's argument.

Ashford is saying that not dismissing aid as a solution doesn't mean we should abandon it. He's focusing on justice, not rejecting it.

So, looking for the option that says aid isn't the only solution but focuses on justice.

Option E says to ignore the issue of global economic justice. So, if that's the opposite of Ashford's point, then E is incorrect.

Wait, so if Ashford says that not dismissing aid doesn't mean we should abandon it, then the opposite (ignoring the issue) would be the wrong choice.

So, the correct answer would be E if it's the opposite. But the options are options A-J, and the letter is the letter of the option, not the entire option.

So, the correct answer is E, because Ashford's argument is about not dismissing aid as the solution, not about ignoring it. So, E is about ignoring, which is the opposite, so it's not the correct answer.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again.

Ashford argues that worries about dependency don't mean abandoning aid. So, he's not dismissing it, but is suggesting that it's not the only solution. So, the options should be those that support that.

Option E says to ignore the issue of global economic justice. So, if that's the opposite of his statement, then E is incorrect.

The options are:

E: ignore the issue of global economic justice.

So, if Ashford is saying that we should not abandon aid, ignoring the issue would be the opposite. So, E is the incorrect response.

Therefore, the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure because Ashford is arguing that we shouldn't abandon aid because it's not the only solution. So, the correct answer is E because it's the opposite of his reasoning.

Wait, no. The question is, which option correctly answers the question, which is Ashford's argument. So, the correct option is the one that says he's not dismissing aid as the solution, but he's focusing on justice.

Which option states that? Looking again:

A: suggest aid is only solution → no, Ashford says not to dismiss aid.

B: abandon poor's unjust situation → no, he's not dismissing aid.

C: aid is inherently unjust → no, Ashford's argument is about not ignoring it, not about it being unjust.

D: increase aid → no, he's not about increasing aid.

E: ignore the issue of global economic justice → this is opposite of his reasoning.

So, Ashford's point is that aid isn't the only solution, so E is not the answer. So the correct answer is E's opposite, which is not correct. So, maybe none of the options directly match except E.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the question is testing. The question is about Ashford's argument that not worrying about dependency doesn't mean we should abandon aid. So, the correct answer would be an option that supports that idea. 

So, the options are:

E: ignore the issue of global economic justice.

If Ashford is saying that it's not about ignoring the issue, but about using aid correctly, then E is the opposite, so it's incorrect. So, the answer is E's opposite, which isn't correct, so the correct answer is the one that says aid is not the only solution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it as a logic problem. Ashford states that not worrying about dependency doesn't mean we should abandon aid. So, he's saying that aid isn't the only solution. So, the correct answer is the one that aligns with that.

Looking at the options, which option aligns with that? 

Option E is about ignoring the issue, which is not what Ashford is saying. So, the correct answer is not E.

So, the correct answer is the one that says aid isn't the only solution. So, it's not A, B, C, D, or E except perhaps E is not the correct one.

Wait, let me think about each option:

A: Suggest aid is only solution. Ashford says it's not the only solution, so A is incorrect.

B: Abandon the poor. Ashford doesn't dismiss aid, so B is incorrect.

C: Aid is inherently unjust. Ashford doesn't say aid is inherently unjust, so C is incorrect.

D: Increase aid. He doesn't say to increase, so D is incorrect.

E: Ignore global economic justice. Ashford's point is that aid isn't the only solution, so E is incorrect.

So, none of the options except E is not correct. But the question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the correct answer is the letter.

So, the correct answer is the one that fits Ashford's reasoning. So, since none of the options except E is incorrect, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the options again.

Wait, option F: force the poor to be self-sufficient. Ashford is arguing that we shouldn't abandon aid, but he's not dismissing it. So, F is about self-sufficiency, which is a different issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, because it's the opposite of his statement. So, if Ashford says we shouldn't abandon aid, then E (ignore) is the opposite.

So, the correct answer is E, because it's the opposite of what Ashford is saying. So, the answer is E.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to cross-verify.

Another approach: the question is about the last letter of the response. So, the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are designed so that the correct answer is E.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating. Let's make a quick decision.

The correct answer is E. So, the answer is E.
</think>

The question revolves around Ashford's argument that not worrying about dependency doesn't mean abandoning aid. The correct answer must align with this reasoning. Let's analyze the options:

- **A**: Suggests aid is only the solution to global poverty. This is incorrect because Ashford's argument is about not dismissing aid as a solution.
- **B**: Abolishes the poor's unjust situation. This is unrelated to Ashford's focus.
- **C**: Argues aid is inherently unjust. This is not Ashford's stance.
- **D**: Suggests increasing aid is necessary. This is not Ashford's argument.
- **E**: Inhibits ignoring the issue of global economic justice. This is the opposite of Ashford's point, so it is incorrect.
- **F**: Forces self-sufficiency. This is unrelated to Ashford's reasoning.

Since none of the options perfectly match Ashford's argument, the closest fit is **E**, as it is the opposite of his reasoning. However, since the question requires selecting the correct letter, and **E** is the only option that doesn't align with Ashford's argument, it is the best choice.
