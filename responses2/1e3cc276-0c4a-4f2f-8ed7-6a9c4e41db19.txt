Question:

Describe a procedure that can be used to determine inventory turnover rate.

Options:

A: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by dividing total sales by ending inventory.
B: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by dividing total sales by average inventory.
C: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the average inventory.
D: Inventory turnover rate is determined by adding the cost of goods sold to the ending inventory.
E: Inventory turnover rate is found by dividing average inventory by the cost of goods sold.
F: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by dividing the beginning inventory by the cost of goods sold.
G: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the beginning and ending inventory by the cost of goods sold.
H: The inventory turnover rate can be calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.
I: Inventory turnover rate is calculated by multiplying the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.
J: The inventory turnover rate is found by subtracting the average inventory from the total sales.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to determine the inventory turnover rate. I remember studying this in my business class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

So, inventory turnover rate is a measure of how efficiently a company is managing its inventory. The higher the turnover, the more times the inventory is sold and replaced within a certain period. That makes sense because it indicates the company isn't holding onto too much stock.

I think the key here is the average inventory. Because if you have high inventory at the beginning and end of the period, the average would smooth that out. So, the formula must involve the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the average inventory.

Wait, what's the formula again? I recall it's something like COGS divided by average inventory. Or wait, maybe it's COGS divided by the average inventory. Or is it something else?

Wait, another approach: inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory. Because COGS represents the cost of the inventory sold during the period, and dividing that by the average inventory gives how many times inventory was sold on average. So, higher turnover means the company sells its inventory more frequently.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Sales / Ending Inventory. That doesn't sound right because sales might not directly relate to inventory turnover. Unless it's specifically about units sold, but the question mentions inventory turnover.

Option B: Sales / Average Inventory. Same confusion here. It's sales divided by average, but I think the key is COGS and average inventory.

Option C: Subtracting COGS from average inventory. That doesn't make sense. The result would have units of money, which doesn't fit the turnover rate, which is unitless.

Option D: Add COGS to ending inventory. Doesn't seem relevant.

Option E: Average Inventory / COGS. That would be the inverse of B. So E would give the inverse ratio, which isn't the turnover rate.

Option F: Beginning inventory / COGS. No, that doesn't make sense.

Option G: Sum of beginning and ending divided by COGS. Sum divided by COGS? I'm not sure. Let me think: Sum of beginning and ending is the total inventory over two periods, and dividing by COGS doesn't directly relate.

Option H: COGS / Average Inventory. That's exactly what I remember.

Option I: COGS multiplied by average inventory. That seems like a cost of goods sold times average, but that's not a turnover rate. It's more like a total cost or something else.

Option J: Subtracting average inventory from sales. Again, units don't match.

So I think the correct answer is option H.

The correct procedure to determine the inventory turnover rate involves dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory. This ratio measures how many times inventory is sold and replaced during a period. 

ANSWER: H
