Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. A body is moving in the positive x-direction and passes the origin at time t=0. Between t=0 and t=1 second, it's moving at a constant speed of 24 m/s. Then, at t=1, it gets a constant acceleration of 6 m/s² in the negative x direction. I need to find its position at t=11 seconds. Oh, and the options are given from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, let's think about the initial movement from t=0 to t=1. Since it's moving at a constant speed, the position during this time can be found using the equation x(t) = x0 + v*t. At t=0, x is 0 because it passes the origin. So, x(1) would be 0 + 24*1 = 24 meters. So at t=1, the body is at 24 m.

Now, starting at t=1, the body starts accelerating. The acceleration is -6 m/s² because it's in the negative x direction. So, acceleration a = -6 m/s². I remember that acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and velocity is the derivative of position. Since the acceleration is constant, this will result in a uniformly accelerated motion, which is like projectile motion but along the x-axis.

Wait, the velocity at t=1 second is important here. Because after that, the velocity will start changing. So, let's calculate the velocity at t=1. The initial velocity from the first phase is 24 m/s. Since acceleration is 0 before t=1, the velocity remains 24 m/s until t=1. So, at t=1, the velocity is still 24 m/s. Now, from t=1 onwards, the acceleration is -6 m/s², so the velocity will decrease.

I think I should calculate the velocity at various times to model the motion. Let's see. The acceleration is constant, so the velocity as a function of time after t=1 would be v(t) = v_initial + a*(t - t_initial). Wait, t_initial is 1, and v_initial is 24 m/s. So,

v(t) = 24 + (-6)(t - 1) = 24 -6(t-1). Let me simplify that: 24 -6t +6 = (24+6) -6t = 30 -6t.

Wait, but wait, let me think. If at t=1, the velocity is 24, and then each second after that, it decreases by 6 m/s. So, at t=2, it's 24-6=18 m/s. At t=3, 12 m/s. t=4,6... and so on. So, yes, the equation looks correct.

Now, to find the position at t=11, I'll need to split this into two parts: from t=0 to t=1, and from t=1 to t=11.

First part is straightforward: x1 = 0 + 24*1 = 24 m.

Second part: from t=1 to t=11, which is 10 seconds. So, from t=1 to t=11, the body is under constant acceleration. Since the acceleration is constant, I can compute the displacement during this time using the kinematic equation for displacement under constant acceleration.

The kinematic equation is x(t) = x0 + v0*t + 0.5*a*t². But wait, in this case, x0 is the position at t=1, which is 24 m. v0 is 24 m/s. a is -6 m/s². t in this case is 10 seconds (from t=1 to t=11).

Wait, no. Wait, the displacement from t=1 to t=11 is the integral of velocity over that time. Alternatively, using the equation:

x(t) = x_initial + v_initial * t + 0.5 a t².

But in this case, the initial position (x_initial) is 24, initial velocity (v_initial) is 24, and time (t) is 10 seconds.

So, x2 = 24 + 24*10 + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2.

Let me compute each term:

24*10 = 240.

0.5*(-6)*100 = 0.5*(-6)*100 = (-6)*50 = -300.

So, 24 + 240 = 264; 264 -300 = -36.

So x2 is -36 meters.

Wait, but wait. Also, do I need to account for the initial position at t=1? Because x(t=1) is 24, but the equation I used is for t=11, which is 10 seconds later. So, the total displacement from t=1 to t=11 is -36 meters. Because the displacement is x(t) - x(1), which would be -36 - 24 = -60? Wait no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The kinematic equation gives x(t) from t=1 as the position, so x(11) is x at t=11, which is 24 + 24*(10) + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2.

Wait, no. The kinematic equation is correct when starting from t=1. So, x(t) at t=11 is 24 + (24 *10) + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2.

So, 24 + 240 = 264; 0.5*(-6) = -3, 3*100=300. So, 264 - 300 = -36.

So, x at t=11 is -36 meters. But wait, that's the position. So, the options have B as -36m. But wait, the options include other possibilities. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity at t=11 and use another approach. Let's try that.

The velocity at any time t >=1 is v(t) = 24 -6(t-1). So, at t=11, v(11)=24 -6*(10) = 24-60 = -36 m/s.

Now, the average velocity during the 10 seconds (from t=1 to t=11) is (v_initial + v_final)/2. v_initial is 24 m/s, v_final is -36 m/s. So average velocity is (24-36)/2 = (-12)/2 = -6 m/s.

So displacement is average velocity multiplied by time: -6 m/s * 10 s = -60 meters. Then, adding the initial 24 meters: 24 + (-60) = -36 meters. So, same result.

Wait, but the two methods give me same result. But wait, earlier when I computed x(t)=24 + 240 -300 = -36, which is correct. So, the position at t=11 is -36 meters. Looking at the options, answer B is -36m. So, that would be the answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -36m, which is what we got. But wait, the options also have other possibilities. Let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another approach: the motion from t=1 to t=11 is under constant acceleration. So, the displacement can be found by:

x = x0 + v0 * t + 0.5 a t².

Here, x0 is the position at t=1, which is 24 m. v0 is 24 m/s. a is -6 m/s². t is 10 seconds.

So,

x = 24 + 24*10 + 0.5*(-6)*(10)^2.

Compute each term:

24*10 = 240.

0.5*(-6)*100 = (-3)*100 = -300.

So, 24 + 240 = 264.

264 - 300 = -36.

So, x = -36 meters. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait. Another way: the position at t=1 is 24. Then, during the next 10 seconds, the body will slow down until it comes to a stop, and then start moving in the negative direction.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the time when the velocity becomes zero. Because at time t after t=1, velocity is 24 -6(t-1). When does this equal zero?

Set 24 -6(t-1) = 0.

24 = 6(t-1) → t-1 = 4 → t =5 seconds from t=1. So, at t=5, velocity is zero. Then, the body starts moving in the negative direction.

So, from t=1 to t=5, the body is moving at decreasing speed until it stops. Then, from t=5 to t=11, it's moving at negative speed (since velocity is -36 m/s at t=11, but wait, earlier calculation says at t=5, velocity is zero, and then at t=6 it's -6 m/s, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should model the motion in two phases: the first phase (t=0 to t=1) and the second phase (t=1 to t=11).

In the first phase, the body's position is x = 24 m at t=1.

In the second phase, from t=1 to t=11 (10 seconds), it's under constant acceleration. So, using the kinematics equation again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the velocity at t=11 and then find the displacement.

Velocity at t=11 is v(11) =24 -6*(11-1) =24 -6*10=24-60= -36 m/s.

So, to find the displacement during the second phase, which is from t=1 to t=11, we can use the average velocity.

The average velocity is (v_initial + v_final)/2 = (24 + (-36))/2 = (-12)/2 = -6 m/s.

Displacement is average velocity multiplied by time: -6 m/s *10 s= -60 m.

Then, the total displacement from t=1 is -60 m, but the position at t=1 is 24 m. So, position at t=11 is 24 + (-60) = -36 m.

So, yes, the answer is -36m. Looking back, option B is -36m, so that's the correct choice.
</think>

The problem involves a body moving in the positive x-direction, initially at the origin at t=0, moving at 24 m/s until t=1, then accelerating at -6 m/s² for the next 10 seconds (until t=11). The goal is to find the position of the body at t=11 seconds.

1. **Initial motion (t=0 to t=1):**  
   The body moves at a constant speed of 24 m/s.  
   At t=1, its position is:  
   \[
   x(1) = 0 + 24 \cdot 1 = 24 \, \text{m}.
   \]

2. **Acceleration phase (t=1 to t=11):**  
   The body starts with an initial velocity of 24 m/s and accelerates at -6 m/s² for 10 seconds. Using the kinematic equation for displacement:  
   \[
   x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2,
   \]  
   where \( x_0 = 24 \, \text{m} \), \( v_0 = 24 \, \text{m/s} \), \( a = -6 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   x(11) = 24 + 24 \cdot 10 + \frac{1}{2} (-6) (10)^2.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   x(11) = 24 + 240 - 300 = -36 \, \text{m}.
   \]

3. **Verification using velocity:**  
   The velocity at any time \( t \geq 1 \) is:  
   \[
   v(t) = 24 - 6 (t - 1).
   \]  
   At \( t = 11 \):  
   \[
   v(11) = 24 - 6 \cdot 10 = -36 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]  
   The average velocity during the 10 seconds is:  
   \[
   \text{Average velocity} = \frac{v(1) + v(11)}{2} = \frac{24 + (-36)}{2} = -6 \, \text{m/s}.
   \]  
   Displacement is:  
   \[
   \Delta x = \text{Average velocity} \cdot \text{Time} = -6 \cdot 10 = -60 \, \text{m}.
   \]  
   Total position at \( t = 11 \):  
   \[
   x(11) = x(1) + \Delta x = 24 - 60 = -36 \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The position of the body at \( t = 11 \, \text{s} \) is \( -36 \, \text{m} \). Among the options, this corresponds to **B: -36m**.
