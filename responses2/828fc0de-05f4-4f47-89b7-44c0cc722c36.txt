Okay, so I have this math problem here: −25 − (−11). Hmm, let me think about how to solve this. I remember that when you subtract a negative number, it's the same as adding the positive version of that number. So, like, −a − (−b) is the same as −a + b. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting this right. So, the expression is −25 minus (negative 11). So, substituting, it's like −25 minus (−11). According to the rules, subtracting a negative is adding a positive. So, this becomes −25 + 11. 

Now, adding a positive to a negative number. I think this is where the signs come into play. The bigger number is 25 and the smaller is 11. Since 25 is larger than 11, the result will be negative. So, 25 minus 11 is 14, and since the bigger number was negative, the result is negative 14. 

Let me double-check. −25 minus (−11) equals −25 + 11. So, −25 + 11 is −14. That makes sense because adding a positive 11 to −25 would bring it closer to zero and then beyond, so it's negative. 

So looking at the options, option B is −14, which should be the correct answer.

The correct answer is B: −14.

Step-by-step explanation:

The expression is −25 − (−11). Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding the positive of that number. So, −25 − (−11) becomes −25 + 11. Adding 11 to −25 gives −14. 

Answer: B: −14
