Okay, so I have this question about the capital/output ratio, and I need to figure out the answer. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the capital/output ratio is a measure of how much capital goods are needed to produce a certain amount of goods. It's calculated by dividing capital stock by the annual output. 

The question says that the capital/output ratio for annual output is 2. So that means, for every unit of output produced in a year, the economy uses 2 units of capital. But the question is about the quarterly version. I think since output is annual, breaking it down into quarters means each quarter's output is a quarter of the annual output. So if annual output is Y, then the quarterly output is Y/4.

Now, the capital used in each quarter would be the annual capital divided by 4, right? Because the annual capital is spread over four quarters. So the capital per quarterly output would be (K)/(Y/4), where K is the annual capital. That simplifies to (K/Y) * 4. 

Wait, because K/Y is the annual capital/output ratio, which is given as 2. So substituting that in, it's 2 * 4, which is 8. So the quarterly capital/output ratio should be 8. Looking at the options, option E is 8. 

Wait, but let me double-check. If annual output is Y, then each quarter is Y/4. The capital used per quarter would be K/4. So the ratio is (K/4)/(Y/4) = K/Y, which is 2. Oh wait, that's the same as annual. That can't be right. Wait, no, that's not the case. Because if the annual ratio is 2, then K/Y is 2, so K = 2Y. Then, each quarterly output is Y/4, and K is 2Y. So the quarterly ratio is (2Y) / (Y/4) = 8. Oh, that's correct. So the quarterly ratio is 8.

The capital/output ratio for annual output is 2, meaning capital is twice the output each year. To find the quarterly ratio, divide annual output by 4, so each quarter's output is Y/4. The capital used per quarter is K/4, and since K/Y = 2, the quarterly ratio becomes (K/4)/(Y/4) = 2. Therefore, the quarterly ratio is 8.
