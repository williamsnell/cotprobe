Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. The question is asking for the interval of all u such that neither 2u nor -20u is in the interval (-∞, -1). The answer options are labeled A through J, each giving a different interval. 

Hmm, so I need to find all u where both 2u is not less than -1 and -20u is also not less than -1. Wait, no, the condition is that neither 2u nor -20u is in (-∞, -1). So both 2u and -20u must be greater than or equal to -1. Because if either is less than -1, it's excluded.

Wait, no, actually. Let me clarify. The interval (-∞, -1) includes all numbers less than -1. So if 2u is in (-∞, -1), that would mean 2u < -1. Similarly, if -20u is in (-∞, -1), then -20u < -1. 

Wait, but the question says neither 2u nor -20u is in that interval. So 2u is not in (-∞, -1), which means 2u must be ≥ -1. Similarly, -20u must be ≥ -1. 

Wait, that makes sense. So for 2u ≥ -1, solving for u would give u ≥ -1/2. And for -20u ≥ -1, let's solve that. Multiply both sides by -1, but remember that flipping the inequality when multiplying by a negative. So 20u ≤ 1. Then u ≤ 1/20. 

Wait, let me double-check the second inequality. The original condition is that -20u is not in (-∞, -1), so -20u ≥ -1. So adding 20u to both sides: 0 ≥ 20u -1, which is 20u ≤ 1, so u ≤ 1/20. 

So combining both conditions, u must be ≥ -1/2 and ≤ 1/20. So the interval is [-1/2, 1/20]. Looking at the options, that's option E: [-1/2, 1/20]. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the inequalities. So 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -1/2. And -20u ≥ -1 → multiply both sides by -1, which reverses the inequality: 20u ≤ 1 → u ≤ 1/20. So the interval is from -1/2 to 1/20. 

Wait, but option E is [-1/2, 1/20], which fits. So the correct answer is E. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra. 

Wait, another way: If 2u is not in (-∞, -1), then 2u ≥ -1 → u ≥ -1/2. Similarly, -20u not in (-∞, -1) → -20u ≥ -1 → 20u ≤1 → u ≤ 1/20. 

Yes, that's correct. So the interval is u between -1/2 and 1/20, including both endpoints. So option E is correct.

The correct interval is all u such that neither 2u nor -20u is in (-∞, -1). This translates to 2u ≥ -1 and -20u ≥ -1. Solving these gives u ≥ -1/2 and u ≤ 1/20. Thus, the interval is [-1/2, 1/20], which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
