Okay, so I have this question about a car accident scenario and I need to figure out which theory best explains the situation. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The scenario is: a major car accident happens. One man stops his car and starts helping people. Then others also stop and help. So, after the man stops, others follow, and they help too. The question is asking which theory explains this.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: Self-fulfilling Prophecy. I remember that this theory suggests that people's beliefs can influence their behavior. But in this case, it's about others stopping after a man does. It's more about an external event causing the behavior, not someone's belief affecting others' behavior directly. So I'm not sure if this fits.

Option B: Social Identity. This theory involves others seeing your actions as part of your social identity. Like, in a group, if you agree to help others, you might feel it's your social role. So in the scenario, others stopping because they agreed to help after the first person did. That seems to fit.

Option C: Cognitive Dissonance. This is about feeling the need to change behavior to match expectations. It's more about why someone might make a choice, but the scenario doesn't seem to involve that. It's more about a decision made based on expectations, not others following.

Option D: Convergence. This is about a group's behavior aligning with the individual's behavior. Like, if everyone follows the same actions, the group becomes more consistent. But in this case, the group actions (helping) are starting from a single person, so maybe not directly related to convergence.

Option E: Emergent-norm. This is when small, local behaviors contribute to a larger, collective norm. But in this case, the behavior is about others following, which seems more like a social identity than an emergence of a norm.

Option F: Deindividuation. This is when people stop interacting with others, leading to social desirability issues. Not sure how that applies here. The scenario doesn't involve people stopping, just stopping and helping.

Option G: Value-added. This is about contributions to the overall value of a product or service. Not sure how this relates to the scenario.

Option H: Social Facilitation. This is when a group's behavior is more frequent or aggressive than expected. Like, a group's behavior becomes more frequent due to social pressure. But the scenario is about an individual helping others, not a group's behavior increasing.

Option I: Bystander Effect. This is about how people avoid harm by not disturbing the scene. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option J: Contagion. This is about a behavior spreading through a population. Like, if someone helps, others might help too. But the scenario is about an accident leading others to stop and help, not a chain reaction of help.

So, the scenario is about others following after a person does. That seems to align with social identityâ€”people seeing others as part of their social roles or agreements. So option B would be the best fit.

The scenario describes a situation where others stop helping after a man does, suggesting a pattern of social behavior. The best explanation is that others are seen as part of their social identity, agreeing to help after the initial person. This aligns with **Social Identity**, option B.

Answer: B
