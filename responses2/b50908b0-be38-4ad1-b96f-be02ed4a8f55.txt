Okay, so I've got this question about the economic definition of labor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what the economic definition of labor is, with options A through J. I remember that in economics, labor refers to the resources used to produce goods and services. So, the basic idea is that labor is the input used in the production process.

Let me look at each option. Option A says it's all human abilities or talents that can be used in production. That sounds right. Because in economics, it's about what people can contribute, not just physical work. So, A seems correct.

Option B talks about physical work. Well, maybe, but if you take the economic definition, it's broader. It's not just about physical labor but any ability, whether it's machinery or not. So B might be a partial correct statement but not the complete definition.

Option C says labor is only factory workers and manual laborers. That's too narrow. Labor can include any kind of worker, not just those in factories. So C is incorrect.

Option D says labor is the effort put into a task. That's more about the output than the input. In economics, the input is labor, not the output. So D is about output, not the definition of input.

Option E is about managing resources in a company. While managing resources is a part of what labor does, the definition itself is about the input, not the output or management.

Option F: Management of resources. Again, that's about output and management, not the input.

Option G: Machinery and equipment. That's part of production, but it's more about the output and tools used, not the labor itself.

Option H: Capital used to start a business. Capital is a different term from labor. Capital refers to fixed assets like machinery, while labor is the input. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Capital used. No, that's capital. Labor is the input.

Option J: Hiring and managing employees. That's about the process, not the input itself. The input is the laborers, not the process of hiring.

So, the only option that correctly captures the input aspect is A. It says labor consists of human abilities or talents which can be used in production, which matches the economic definition.
