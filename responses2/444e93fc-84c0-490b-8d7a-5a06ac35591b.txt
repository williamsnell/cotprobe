Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about consequentialism. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is about what determines the rightness or wrongness of an action according to consequentialism. The options are A through J. I remember that consequentialism is a moral theory that focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions, not on the individual's personal beliefs or moral principles at the time.

So, the key idea here is that the consequences of the action matter. Consequentialism says that the best action is the one that leads to the most positive or desirable outcomes. It doesn't care about whether the action fits with personal beliefs or whether it's right according to some moral framework. 

Looking at the options:

A: The individual's personal beliefs and morals at the time. Hmm, but that's more about individualism, not consequentialism. Consequentialism is about outcomes, not the individual's choices.

B: Whether a virtuous person would endorse a rule. That's more about whether someone's actions align with certain rules, which seems more related to virtue ethics or rule-based ethics, not consequentialism.

C: That action's relationship to the operative rules of law. Oh, but again, that's about law and law enforcement, not the outcomes. Consequentialism is about the end result, not the rules governing the situation.

D: Alignment with universally accepted human rights. No, that's about rights and ethics beyond consequences. Consequentialism is about the outcomes, not the rights themselves.

E: Immediate consequences of the action. Wait, that seems right. Consequentialism says the consequences are what matter, not the immediate ones. The consequences are the outcomes, so E is about the end results.

F: Logical consistency behind the motive. That's about why someone acts in a certain way, which is more about the cause than the outcome. Consequentialism is about the end, so F might not be correct.

G: Religious doctrine approval. That's a different area, more about personal beliefs rather than the consequences of an action.

H: Whether the action aligns with utilitarianism. No, because we're talking about consequentialism, which is a different framework. Utilitarianism focuses on the best interests of the greatest good, but consequentialism is more about the outcomes.

I: Societal norms. Again, not directly about the outcomes. It's about social expectations, not the consequences.

J: Action required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule. That's more about rules and regulation, which is part of the context of the rule (like law) or social norms, not the focus of the theory itself.

So, the correct answer should be E: the immediate consequences of the action, regardless of any established rules. That aligns with the idea that the consequences are key in consequentialism, not the rules that might affect them.

I remember that in consequentialism, the focus is on what the action leads to, not what rules would dictate. So E fits best.

The correct answer is E: the immediate consequences of the action, regardless of any established rules.

Answer: E
