Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about plated copper. Let me think through it step by step. The question is asking how many coulombs are needed to plate out 50g of copper from an aqueous solution of CuSO4, assuming 100% efficiency. Hmm. I remember that plating involves electrolysis, so I should probably use Faraday's laws of electrolysis.

Wait, what's the process here? Copper dissolves in sulfuric acid solution, right? So the anode (oxidation) and cathode (reduction) reactions are involved. The anode is where oxidation happens, and the cathode where reduction occurs. The overall reaction would involve the transfer of electrons. 

The formula for Faraday's law is Q = (n × F × V), but wait, no, wait. Faraday's law relates charge to moles of substance. Oh right, the formula is Q = n × F × t, but in this case, since we're dealing with a current, I think it's Q = n × F × (charge per electron). Oh, wait, no, Q is the total charge, n is the number of moles of electrons, F is Faraday's constant, which is 96,485 C/mol e-.

So the key is to find the number of moles of copper being plated, multiply by the number of electrons per copper atom, and then by Faraday's constant.

Let me write down the relevant reactions. The copper sulfate solution dissociates into Cu²+ and SO4^2- ions. During electrolysis, the Cu²+ will be reduced to Cu metal, and the H+ (if any) will be oxidized to H2. But since this is a simple copper plate, perhaps the solution is just CuSO4 in water, so H+ ions are present but I think in this case, the anode is where Cu²+ is reduced, and the cathode is where H+ is oxidized to H2. Or wait, maybe not. Oh wait, in acidic solution, if you're doing a copper plate, perhaps the anode is oxidation of Cu²+ to Cu metal, and the cathode is the reduction of SO4^2- to SO2 or something? Wait, no, I might be mixing this up.

Alternatively, perhaps the copper is being deposited at the cathode. Let me think: the cathode is where reduction occurs. In CuSO4 solution, the Cu²+ will be reduced to Cu metal. So each Cu²+ gains two electrons to become Cu.

So the reaction at cathode is Cu²+ + 2e- → Cu.

So each mole of copper requires 2 moles of electrons.

So the number of moles of electrons needed is n = 2 * moles of Cu.

Moles of Cu is mass/molar mass. Molar mass of Cu is about 63.55 g/mol. So 50g / 63.55 g/mol ≈ 0.786 moles.

So n = 2 * 0.786 ≈ 1.572 moles of electrons.

Wait, but wait. Faraday's constant is 96485 C/mol e-. So total charge Q is n * F = 1.572 * 96485 C.

Let me calculate that. Let me compute 1.572 * 96485.

Hmm, 1.572 * 96485. Let's break this down.

Approximately, 1.5 * 96485 = 144,727.5 C.

But wait, 0.072 * 96485 is about 6988.68 C. So total is about 151,716 C. Hmm, wait but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

Wait, 1.572 * 96485.

Let me compute 1.572 * 96485:

First, 1 *96485 =96,485

0.5 *96485 =48,242.5

0.07 *96485=6,753.95

0.002 *96485≈192.97

Adding them up: 96,485 +48,242.5 = 144,727.5

Plus 6,753.95 = 151,481.45

Plus 192.97 = 151,674.42 C.

So about 151,674 coulombs. Wait, but the options are in the 1e5 range.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the number of electrons. Because in copper deposition, each Cu²+ gains two electrons, but wait, sometimes when dealing with copper, sometimes it's the other way around. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the number of electrons per Cu.

Wait, another approach: The molar mass of Cu is 63.55 g/mol. So 50g is (50/63.55) ≈ 0.7866 mol Cu.

Each mol of Cu requires 2 mol e- for reduction. So moles of e- is 0.7866 * 2 = 1.5732 mol.

Multiply by Faraday's constant: 1.5732 *96485 ≈ 151,716 C. Wait, but the options are all in the 1e5 range. Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: 1.25e5

B:1.45e5

C:1.67e5

D:1.80e5

E:1.40e5

F:1.75e5

G:1.30e5

H:1.60e5

I:1.52e5

J:1.50e5

Wait, so 1.5e5 is option J. But wait, the calculation gives about 151,716, which is about 1.517e5. But the closest option is I:1.52e5. So perhaps I should look for the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

50g Cu is (50/63.54637) = approximately 0.78699 moles.

Each mole of Cu requires 2 moles of electrons (Cu²+ → Cu: each Cu²+ gains 2e-).

So 0.78699 * 2 = 1.57398 moles e-.

Multiply by 96485 C/mol: 1.57398 *96485.

Let me compute this.

1.57398 * 96485.

Let me compute step by step:

1.57398 * 96485 = ?

First, 1 * 96485 = 96485.

0.57398 *96485.

Compute 0.5 *96485 = 48242.5.

0.07 *96485=6753.95.

0.00398 *96485= let's compute 0.003 *96485=289.455, 0.00098 *96485≈94.555. So 289.455 +94.555=384.01.

So 0.57398 *96485 = 48242.5 +6753.95 = 54996.45 +384.01=55380.46.

So total Q=96485 +55380.46=151865.46 C. Which is approximately 1.51865e5 coulombs, which is about 1.5187e5. The options are up to 1.75e5. The closest option is I:1.52e5. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but let me double-check each step for any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 50g to moles.

Molar mass of Cu: 63.54637 g/mol. So 50 /63.54637 is approximately 0.78699 mol.

Yes.

Each mole of Cu needs 2 moles of electrons.

So 0.78699 *2=1.57398 mol e-.

Multiply by 96485 C/mol e-:

1.57398 *96485.

Let me compute this more accurately.

1.57398 *96485.

Break it into 1 *96485 =96,485.

0.57398 *96485 = ?

Let me compute 0.5 *96485 =48,242.5.

0.07 *96485 =6,753.95.

0.00398 *96485 = Let's compute 0.003 *96485 =289.455.

0.00098 *96485 = approximately 94.555 (since 96485 * 0.00098=94.555).

So 289.455 +94.555=384.01.

So 0.07 *96485 =6,753.95.

0.00398 *96485=384.01.

So adding 48,242.5 (from 0.5) +6,753.95 (0.07) → 55, 000.45?

Wait: 48,242.5 +6,753.95 =54,996.45.

Then +384.01 →55,380.46.

So 0.57398 *96485=55,380.46.

Now, the total Q is 96,485 +55,380.46 =151,865.46 C.

So approximately 151,865 C, which is 1.51865e5 C.

Looking at the options, the closest is I:1.52e5.

So the correct answer should be option I, 1.52e5 coulombs.

To determine the number of coulombs required to plate out 50 g of copper from an aqueous solution of CuSO₄, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The relevant reaction at the cathode is the reduction of Cu²⁺ to Cu:

\[
\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu}.
\]

Each mole of copper requires 2 moles of electrons. The molar mass of copper (Cu) is approximately 63.55 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of copper in 50 g is:

\[
\text{Moles of Cu} = \frac{50}{63.55} \approx 0.7866 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since 2 moles of electrons are required per mole of copper, the total moles of electrons needed are:

\[
\text{Moles of e}^- = 0.7866 \times 2 = 1.5732 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Using Faraday's constant, \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol e}^- \), the total charge \( Q \) is calculated as:

\[
Q = \text{Moles of e}^- \times F = 1.5732 \times 96485 \approx 151,865 \, \text{C}.
\]

This corresponds to approximately \( 1.5187 \times 10^5 \, \text{C} \). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**I: 1.52 × 10⁵ coulombs.**
