Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find f(-1) for a quadratic polynomial f(t) = a + bt + ct². I know that the polynomial passes through three points: (1, -1), (2, 3), and (3, 13). 

Hmm, let me start by understanding what's given. Each point (t, f(t)) gives me an equation. Since f(t) is quadratic, there are three coefficients: a, b, and c. So I can set up three equations using these points to solve for a, b, and c.

Let me write down the equations based on the given points.

For the first point (1, -1):
f(1) = a + b(1) + c(1)² = a + b + c = -1.

Second point (2, 3):
f(2) = a + b(2) + c(2)² = a + 2b + 4c = 3.

Third point (3, 13):
f(3) = a + b(3) + c(3)² = a + 3b + 9c = 13.

So now I have three equations:

1) a + b + c = -1  
2) a + 2b + 4c = 3  
3) a + 3b + 9c = 13  

I need to solve this system of equations for a, b, and c.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a. 

Equation 2 minus equation 1:
(a + 2b + 4c) - (a + b + c) = 3 - (-1)  
a - a + 2b - b + 4c - c = 4  
So, b + 3c = 4. Let's call this equation 4.

Now subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

Equation 3 minus equation 2:
(a + 3b + 9c) - (a + 2b +4c) = 13 -3  
a -a +3b -2b +9c -4c = 10  
So, b +5c =10. Let's call this equation 5.

Now I have two equations:

4) b + 3c =4  
5) b +5c =10  

Subtract equation 4 from equation 5 to eliminate b:

(b +5c) - (b +3c) =10 -4  
b -b +5c-3c =6  
2c =6  
So, c = 3.

Now substitute c=3 back into equation 4: b + 3*3=4 → b +9=4 → b=4-9 → b= -5.

Now find a using equation 1: a + (-5) +3 = -1 → a -5 +3 = -1 → a -2 = -1 → a=1.

So the polynomial is f(t) = 1 -5t +3t².

Wait, but let me double-check:

f(1) = 1 -5(1) +3(1) = 1-5+3= -1 → Correct.

f(2) =1 -10 +12=3 → Correct.

f(3)=1 -15 +27=13 → Correct. So the coefficients are right.

Now I need to find f(-1). Let's plug t=-1 into f(t):

f(-1)=1 -5*(-1) +3*(-1)^2 =1 +5 +3(1) =1+5+3=9.

Wait, but looking at the options, 9 is option G. But wait, the options don't include G as an option. Wait, the options are:

A:3, B:11, C:5, D:1, E:6, F:-3, G:9, H:7, I:15, J:-1.

Oh, so G is 9. So the answer should be G:9.

To determine \( f(-1) \) for the quadratic polynomial \( f(t) = a + bt + ct^2 \), we first solve for the coefficients \( a, b, c \) using the given points.

1. **Set up the equations:**
   - For \((1, -1)\): \( a + b + c = -1 \).
   - For \((2, 3)\): \( a + 2b + 4c = 3 \).
   - For \((3, 13)\): \( a + 3b + 9c = 13 \).

2. **Subtract equations to eliminate \( a \):**
   - Subtracting equation 1 from 2: \( b + 3c = 4 \) (equation 4).
   - Subtracting equation 2 from 3: \( b + 5c = 10 \) (equation 5).

3. **Solve for \( c \):**
   - Subtracting equation 4 from 5: \( 2c = 6 \) ⇒ \( c = 3 \).

4. **Find \( b \) using equation 4:**
   - \( b + 3(3) = 4 \) ⇒ \( b = -5 \).

5. **Find \( a \) using equation 1:**
   - \( a -5 + 3 = -1 \) ⇒ \( a = 1 \).

6. **Polynomial is \( f(t) = 1 -5t +3t^2 \). Compute \( f(-1) \):**
   - \( f(-1) = 1 -5(-1) +3(-1)^2 = 1 +5 +3 = 9 \).

The answer is **G:9**.
