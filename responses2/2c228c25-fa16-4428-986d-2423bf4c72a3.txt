Okay, so I've got this question here. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about analyzing the levels of 13C in bones to determine what someone ate. I remember that 13C labeling is used in radiology to show what a person ate based on their dietary habits. So, the idea is that different foods are labeled with different isotopes, and when you take blood and bone samples, you can see what the isotopes are. 

I think the key here is that 13C labeling is based on the breakdown of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides, which are sugars. So, if someone's bones have more 13C, that means they ate more carbohydrates. But wait, what are the types of carbohydrates? There are carbs like starches and sugars, and also fiber.

So, the options are A to J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: high in calcium or low in calcium. Hmm, calcium is related to minerals, but I'm not sure how that connects to 13C levels. Maybe if someone ate more calcium-rich foods, their bones would have higher 13C. But I thought 13C in bones is more about carbohydrates. So perhaps not A.

Option B: high in saturated fats or low in saturated fats. Wait, saturated fats are a type of fat, but 13C labeling is more about carbohydrates. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C: mostly grains or mostly nuts and fruits. Grains are a broad category, including fruits and nuts. So, if someone ate a lot of grains, their bone 13C would be high. But does this differentiate between two main types? Maybe the answer is more about whether they ate grains in general or something else.

Option D: mostly root vegetables or mostly leafy greens. Wait, root vegetables and leafy greens are both types of蔬菜. If someone ate mostly root veggies, would that affect their 13C? I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about the composition of the whole diet, not just the types. So D might not be the correct answer.

Option E: high in sugar or low in sugar. Oh, wait, I remember that sugars are a type of carbohydrate. So if someone ate a lot of sugars, their bone 13C would be high. But the question is about which diet they ate, not the amount. So if the question is about whether they ate a high or low sugar diet, this would be E. But the question isn't about the diet as high or low, but rather what the 13C levels indicate.

Wait, looking back: the question says "by analyzing the levels of 13C in bones, researchers can establish whether an individual ate:". So the answer is a statement about their diet. So the correct statement would be about their eating habits.

Option E is about high or low in sugar. So if someone's 13C is high, it suggests they ate a lot of sugars. But I think the 13C labeling is more specific. Maybe it's about whether they ate more high in carbs (like in a high-sugar diet) or low. Or perhaps it's about if they ate more of a certain type of carbohydrate.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing between total carbohydrates and specific types. Let me think again. The 13C in bone reflects the overall consumption of carbohydrates. So if someone ate a lot of carbohydrates, their bone would have high 13C.

So looking at options, any options that are about carbohydrates? Let me check:

Wait, perhaps option E is incorrect because it's about sugar, which is a subset of carbohydrates. So E is about sugar, but the bone 13C would also reflect other carbs like fiber.

Wait, no. The 13C in bone is more indicative of carbohydrates than of specific types of carbohydrates. So the correct answer should relate to the overall consumption of carbohydrates, not just sugar.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the answer is about the types of food. For example, if you ate a lot of grains, your bone would have high 13C.

Looking at the options again: Option C says "mostly grains or mostly nuts and fruits". So if someone ate mostly grains, their bone would have high 13C. If they ate mostly nuts and fruits, maybe different. But I'm not sure if this directly tells you if they ate a high or low in grains.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the options. Let me think about the question again: what kind of diet did they consume? So if someone ate a high-sugar diet, their bone would have high 13C (since sugars are a type of carbohydrate). If they ate a low-sugar diet, their 13C would be low. So the question is, from the 13C analysis, which statement is correct.

Looking at the options, option E is about sugar, which is a type of carbohydrate. So a high 13C would suggest they ate a lot of sugar. So the answer would be E. But wait, the options are about whether they ate high or low in a particular category.

Wait, let me read each option again:

Option E: a diet rich in sugar or low in sugar. So if someone ate a high-sugar diet, their 13C would be high.

But the question is, which statement would be established by the 13C levels.

If the 13C is high, the individual ate a high-sugar diet. If low, then low-sugar.

So the correct answer would be E.

But wait, let me look at the other options. Are any of them about types of eating habits?

Option C says "mostly grains or mostly nuts and fruits." This would indicate a high or low in the category of grains, not necessarily sugar.

Another thought: the 13C in bone is used to determine the "carbohydrate content" of the diet. So, if someone has high 13C, they ate more carbohydrates, which includes sugars, fiber, and other carbs. So, a high 13C would mean they ate a high-sugar diet. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but looking at the options again, E says "high in sugar or low in sugar." So if someone's 13C is high, E's first option is true, so the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but the question is, which statement is established? So the answer is E.

So looking back at the options, the correct answer is E.

The question asks which statement about a person's diet is established by analyzing 13C levels in bones. The 13C is an isotope used in radiology to label carbohydrates, particularly in the breakdown of carbohydrates in the body. Carbohydrates include sugars, fiber, and other monosaccharides, and their breakdown is key to understanding 13C levels in bones.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Suggests that 13C levels indicate whether a person ate calcium or not. However, 13C in bones is more indicative of carbohydrate consumption, not calcium. This is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Refers to saturated fats, which are a type of fat, not carbohydrates. 13C labeling is not tied to saturated fats. Incorrect.
- **Option C**: Mentions "mostly grains or mostly nuts and fruits." While this reflects a broad category of food, 13C levels are more about carbohydrates than specific food types. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Suggests "mostly root vegetables or mostly leafy greens." Both are types of vegetables, but 13C labeling does not differentiate between these categories. Incorrect.
- **Option E**: States "a diet high in sugar or low in sugar." Since 13C levels are influenced by carbohydrates, including sugars, a high 13C indicates a high-sugar diet, and a low 13C indicates a low-sugar diet. This aligns with the correct interpretation of 13C labeling. Correct.
- **Options F, G, H, I, J**: These options relate to other dietary factors (e.g., processed foods, dairy, meat, fish, and types of carbohydrates). However, they do not directly relate to the 13C levels in bones, which are more indicative of carbohydrate consumption.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **E**, as 13C levels in bones reflect carbohydrate consumption, and a high level indicates a high-sugar diet, while a low level indicates a low-sugar diet.
