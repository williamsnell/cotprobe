Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about calculating the heat required for two different scenarios. I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has two parts, a and b. 

Part a is about converting a liter of water at 30°C to a liter of water at 60°C. Wait, no, actually, wait, the question says "convert a liter of H2O at 30°C to a liter of water at 60°C." Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo. Because a liter of water is a fixed amount, but in the same phase (assuming it's liquid water). But the other part is heating a block of aluminum from 30 to 60. I think I'll focus on each part separately.

Let's tackle part a. So, I need to find the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 liter of water from 30°C to 60°C. Wait, but wait—that's not quite right. Because the initial and final states are both water, but the question says "convert a liter of H2O at 30°C to a liter of water at 60°C." Wait, that doesn't make sense because you can't just convert one liter of water at 30 to another at 60 without any process—like heating or cooling. Oh wait, perhaps part a is about heating the water, but the wording is a bit confusing. Or maybe they're just converting, but the question isn't clear. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's about heating 1 liter of water from 30°C to 60°C. Oh wait, I might have misread part a. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says part a is: "convert a liter of H2O at 30°C to a liter of water at 60°C." Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Oh, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be heating the water from 30 to 60. Because otherwise, converting water at 30 to 60 would require no heat if it's the same phase, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about heating the water to 60, and then cooling it back? Hmm, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps part a is about heating 1 liter of water from 30 to 60, but then part b is about heating aluminum.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that part a is about heating water, and part b is about heating aluminum. That would make sense.

So for part a, the initial temperature is 30°C, final is 60°C. The water is 1 liter, which is 1000 grams (assuming it's water, which is 1g/mL). The specific heat of water is given as 1 cal/g°C. So using the formula Q = m * c * ΔT.

So m is 1000g. c is 1 cal/g°C. ΔT is 60-30=30°C. So Q = 1000 *1 *30 = 30,000 cal. Wait, but the question says "convert a liter of H2O at 30°C to a liter of water at 60°C." Hmm, but that's unclear. Because if you're converting, perhaps it's about heating or cooling. But if it's the same phase, then it's just a change in temperature without any phase change. So perhaps part a is about heating the water.

So, 1 liter is 1000g. Q = 1000 g * 1 cal/g°C * (60-30) = 30,000 cal. Now, converting to kcal because the answer options are in Kcal.

1 kcal is 1000 cal, so 30,000 cal is 30 Kcal. So part a would be 30 Kcal.

Wait, but wait the options given: let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options, option G is 30 Kcal, 6.45 Kcal. Hmm. So part a is 30 Kcal. Then part b is the heat required to heat 1 kg of aluminum from 30 to 60. So what's the specific heat for aluminum? The problem states that specific heat of water is 1 cal/g°C, and for aluminum, it's 0.215 cal/g°C. So yeah, that's correct.

So, part b: m is 1kg, which is 1000 grams. c is 0.215. ΔT is 30°C. So Q = 1000g * 0.215 * 30 = 1000 * 6.45 = 6450 cal. Which is 6.45 Kcal.

So putting it together, part a is 30 Kcal and part b is 6.45 Kcal. So looking at the options, option G is 30 Kcal, 6.45 Kcal. So the correct choice would be G.

But wait, looking at the options, for example, option G is 30 Kcal, 6.45 Kcal. So that's the combination.

Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake with part a. The question says "convert a liter of H2O at 30°C to a liter of water at 60°C." Oh wait, perhaps that's a typo and they meant to say heating the water. Because if you just convert the same amount of water from 30 to 60 without any process, that's not possible in terms of heat. Because you need the same mass, same phase, same amount of substance, so no heat is required. So that's not a feasible scenario. But perhaps the question is about heating the water, so that's why part a is about heating.

So my calculation seems right. Part a is 30 Kcal, part b is 6.45 Kcal. So the answer matches option G.

To solve the problem, we calculate the heat required for two scenarios:

### Part (a): Converting 1 liter of water at 30°C to 1 liter of water at 60°C
- The specific heat of water is given as 1 cal/g°C.
- The mass of 1 liter of water is 1000 g.
- The temperature change, ΔT, is 60°C - 30°C = 30°C.

Using the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \):
\[
Q = 1000 \, \text{g} \cdot 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \cdot 30 \, \text{°C} = 30,000 \, \text{cal}
\]
Converting to kilocalories (kcal):
\[
Q = \frac{30,000 \, \text{cal}}{1000} = 30 \, \text{kcal}
\]

### Part (b): Heating 1 kg of aluminum from 30°C to 60°C
- The specific heat of aluminum is given as 0.215 cal/g°C.
- The mass of 1 kg of aluminum is 1000 g.
- The temperature change, ΔT, is 60°C - 30°C = 30°C.

Using the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \):
\[
Q = 1000 \, \text{g} \cdot 0.215 \, \text{cal/g°C} \cdot 30 \, \text{°C} = 6,450 \, \text{cal}
\]
Converting to kilocalories (kcal):
\[
Q = \frac{6,450 \, \text{cal}}{1000} = 6.45 \, \text{kcal}
\]

### Final Answer
The heat required for part (a) is 30 kcal, and for part (b) is 6.45 kcal. Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

**G: 30 Kcal, 6.45 Kcal**
