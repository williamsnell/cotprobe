Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle. Hmm, let me think. The question gives me the shuttle's altitude and Earth's radius, and I need to find the gravitational acceleration there.

Wait, I remember that gravitational acceleration at a certain distance from Earth is given by the formula g = G*M/(r²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the distance from Earth's center. Oh wait, but I think there's another approach using the formula for acceleration due to gravity, especially when you're near the Earth's surface but not exactly on it.

Oh right, near Earth's surface, the gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s², but that's only if you're close enough that the variation in g with altitude is negligible. But wait, the shuttle is orbiting at 300 km above the surface. That's significant because it's much higher than the Earth's radius.

Wait, no, the Earth's radius is 6,400 km, so the shuttle's altitude is 300 km, so r is 6,700 km. But wait, when calculating the gravitational acceleration at that altitude, maybe I should compare it to the acceleration at the Earth's surface. Because I remember that as you go higher, the gravitational acceleration decreases. But how much exactly?

So, the formula for acceleration at a distance r from the center. The acceleration at Earth's surface is 9.8 m/s². At a height h above the Earth's surface, the acceleration would be g' = g * (R/(R + h))², where R is Earth's radius. Wait, R is 6,400 km, h is 300 km. So R + h is 6,700 km.

Let me plug in the numbers. R = 6,400 km, so R + h =6,700 km. The ratio R/(R+h) is 6400/6700. Let me compute that. 6400 divided by 6700. Let's see, 6400 ÷ 6700 = approximately 0.9552. Because 6700 * 0.95 is 6365, and 0.9552 *6700 would be about 6400. So, about 0.9552.

So, (0.9552)^2 is about 0.9125. Because 0.95^2 is 0.9025, 0.955^2 is around 0.912. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, 6400 /6700 = (64 * 100) / (67 * 100) = 64/67. 64 divided by 67. Let me compute 67 * 0.955 = 63.685. Wait, wait, that's confusing. Let me compute 64 /67.

Hmm, 67 * 0.955 is 64. So 64/67 = 0.9552 approximately.

So (0.9552)^2 is (0.9552 * 0.9552). Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

Then, 0.95 * 0.0052 = 0.00494.

Then, 0.0052 * 0.95 = 0.00494.

And 0.0052 * 0.0052 = approx 0.000027.

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 0.9552 * 0.9552.

Alternatively, (a - b)^2 where a=1, b=0.0448.

Wait, 0.9552 = 1 - 0.0448.

So, (1 - 0.0448)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0448 + (0.0448)^2.

Compute each term:

1 = 1.

2*0.0448 = 0.0896.

(0.0448)^2 = approximately 0.002007.

So, 1 - 0.0896 = 0.9104; 0.9104 + 0.002007 is 0.912407.

So, (0.9552)^2 ≈ 0.912407.

So, the gravitational acceleration at the shuttle's altitude would be 9.8 m/s² * 0.9124.

Wait, 9.8 * 0.9124.

Let me compute that.

9.8 * 0.9124. Let's break it down.

9.8 * 0.9 = 8.82.

9.8 * 0.0124 = 0.12152.

So total is 8.82 + 0.12152 = 8.94152 m/s².

Wait, but that's one approach. But wait, is this correct?

Wait, is that approach correct? Because the formula g = g0 * (R/(R+h))², where g0 is 9.8 m/s². So yes, that's the correct approach.

So, 9.8 * (6400/6700)^2 ≈ 9.8 * (0.9552)^2 ≈ 9.8 * 0.9124 ≈ 8.9415 m/s².

Looking back at the options, option F is 8.9 m/s², and option J is 9.8. So my calculation says about 8.94, which would be closest to F.

Wait, but I've heard that the gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface is about 9.81 m/s². So, at 300 km altitude, it's a bit less than that. So, the answer should be just under 9.8, which is approximately 8.9 m/s².

But let me think again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: the gravitational acceleration decreases with the square of the distance. So, when you're at the same radius as Earth, g is 9.8. At 6700 km, it's less.

Another thought: the acceleration at a height h above the Earth's surface is g' = g * (R/(R+h))². So, for h=300 km, R=6400.

So R/(R +h) = 6400/(6700) = 64/67 ≈ 0.9552.

So, g' = 9.8*(64/67)^2.

Wait, let's compute 64/67. Hmm, 64/67 is approximately 0.9552.

So, (0.9552)^2=0.9125. So, 9.8 * 0.9125 = about 8.94375 m/s².

So, approximately 8.94 m/s². Which would make the closest option F (8.9 m/s²).

Wait, but wait a second. Because the shuttle is at 300 km altitude, which is about 0.2% of Earth's radius. So, the inverse square law suggests that the gravity is about (1 / (1.002)^2) times 9.8, which is about 0.996 or 9.8 * 0.996 ≈ 9.76 m/s².

Wait, wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula. The gravitational acceleration at a distance r from the center is given by g = G*M/(r²). Since M is the same, but r increases, g decreases.

But for small heights h, we can approximate using the formula g' ≈ g (R/(R + h))². But wait, let me think in terms of the Earth's radius.

So, R = 6.4e6 meters (6400 km=6,400,000 m). h=3e5 m (300 km). So, R + h is 6,700,000 m.

So, R/(R + h) = 6.4e6 / 6.7e6 ≈ 0.9552238.

So, (0.9552238)^2 is approximately 0.9125.

So, 9.8 * 0.9125 = 8.9425 m/s².

So, that's about 8.94 m/s², which is option F.

But wait, I've heard that the acceleration at 300 km is about 8.68 m/s². Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me calculate 6400/6700 more accurately.

6400 ÷ 6700 = 0.9552238...

So, square of that is (0.9552238)^2.

Let me compute it step by step.

0.9552238 * 0.9552238.

Let me compute it as (0.95 + 0.0052238)^2.

Which is 0.95² + 2*(0.95)(0.0052238) + (0.0052238)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2*0.95*0.0052238 = 0.95 * 0.0104476 ≈ 0.009905.

(0.0052238)^2 ≈ 0.0000273.

Adding all together: 0.9025 + 0.009905 = 0.912405 + 0.0000273 ≈ 0.912432.

So, (0.9552238)^2 ≈ 0.912432.

So, 9.8 * 0.912432 = ?

9.8 * 0.912432 = ?

Let me compute it as 9.8 * 0.9 = 8.82, 9.8 * 0.012432= about 0.12163.

Adding, 8.82 + 0.12163 = 8.94163.

So approximately 8.94163 m/s².

Looking at the options:

A: zero

B:7.5

C:11.1

D:6.3

E:7.8

F:8.9

G:5.

H:10.2

I:4.9

J:9.8.

So the closest is F:8.9.

But wait, I've heard that the acceleration at 300 km is about 8.68 m/s². So why the discrepancy?

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Oh, wait, maybe the formula is g = G*M/(r^2), but another way is to think of it as g = g0/( (R+h/R)^2 ), since r= R + h.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the acceleration due to Earth's gravity at the surface, but nothing.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the shuttle's distance from Earth's center is 6700 km, so the acceleration is 9.8 * (6400/6700)^2 ≈ 9.8*(0.95522)^2 ≈ 8.94, which is about 8.9 m/s².

But why is there a discrepancy between my calculation and the commonly quoted value?

Wait, another approach: the acceleration due to gravity at height h is g = g0 * (R/(R+h))². So for h =300 km, R=6400 km. So, R/(R+h) = 6400/(6700) = 0.95522.

g = 9.8 * (0.95522)^2 ≈ 9.8 * 0.91243 ≈ 8.94 m/s².

But I'm trying to remember, perhaps the commonly known value is lower. For example, I thought the acceleration at 300 km is approximately 8.68 m/s². So, why the difference?

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Because the gravitational acceleration due to Earth is g = G M / r². So, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, but maybe another approach: using the formula g = g0 * (R/(R+h))^2.

But let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 6400/6700:

6400 ÷ 6700 = 0.95522380952.

Square that: 0.95522380952^2 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

0.95522380952 * 0.95522380952.

Let me compute 0.9552238 * 0.9552238.

Let me compute 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

Then, 0.95 * 0.0052238 = 0.004973.

0.0052238 * 0.95 = same value.

0.0052238 * 0.0052238 = approx 0.0000273.

So, putting it all together:

(0.95 + 0.0052238)^2 = (0.95)^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.0052238) + (0.0052238)^2.

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.004973) + 0.0000273.

= 0.9025 + 0.009946 + 0.0000273.

= 0.9124733.

So, (6400/6700)^2 = 0.9124733.

Multiply by 9.8: 9.8 * 0.9124733.

Let's compute 9 * 0.9124733 = 8.2122597.

0.8 * 0.9124733 = 0.730.

Wait, actually, 9.8 = 9 + 0.8.

So, 9 * 0.9124733 = 8.2122597.

0.8 * 0.9124733 = 0.730.

Wait, wait, no. 0.8 * 0.9124733 is 0.730.

Wait, 0.8 * 0.9124733 = 0.730.

So, adding 8.2122597 and 0.730.

8.2122597 + 0.730 = 8.9422597.

Approximately 8.942 m/s².

But wait, the commonly known value is approximately 8.68 m/s². So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps because the shuttle is in orbit. Oh wait, no. The shuttle is in orbit, but the question is about the gravitational acceleration experienced by the shuttle, not the acceleration due to gravity on the shuttle's own mass. Or perhaps the question is about the acceleration due to Earth's gravity at that point.

Wait, no, the question is asking about the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle. That is, the acceleration due to Earth's gravity at that point. Because the shuttle is in orbit, it's subject to gravitational force from Earth, but the question is specifically about the acceleration at that point.

So, according to the formula, it should be about 8.9 m/s², which is option F.

Wait, but another source I remember says that at 300 km altitude, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 8.68 m/s². So why the difference?

Ah, perhaps because the shuttle is in orbit and is experiencing centripetal acceleration as well. So, the total acceleration experienced by the Shuttle is the vector sum of the gravitational acceleration and the centripetal acceleration.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Shuttle, not the acceleration felt by the passengers. Or perhaps, it's a trick question. Let me read the question again.

The question: What is the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle at 300 km altitude.

Ah, but the Space Shuttle is in orbit, so is it experiencing any acceleration due to its own motion? No, because the question is about the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Shuttle. So, the shuttle's acceleration is the gravitational acceleration it would feel, which is 8.94 m/s².

But wait, perhaps the shuttle is orbiting Earth, so its velocity is tangential, and the gravitational acceleration is directed radially. So, the gravitational acceleration is directed towards Earth's center, and the shuttle's velocity is tangential. So, the gravitational acceleration is the only acceleration affecting the shuttle's orbit. But the question is about the acceleration experienced by the shuttle, which is the gravitational acceleration.

But wait, no. Because the gravitational acceleration is the acceleration due to Earth's gravity. So, the shuttle's acceleration is the same as the gravitational acceleration at its altitude.

Wait, but then why the discrepancy with the commonly known value of ~8.68 m/s².

Ah, perhaps the shuttle is in a higher orbit, but the question is about the gravitational acceleration at 300 km. So, the shuttle is at 300 km, so its gravitational acceleration is 8.94 m/s², which is option F.

But I'm a bit confused because I think the commonly known value is 8.68 m/s². Maybe I should think of the gravitational acceleration at Earth's surface.

Wait, another approach: The acceleration due to gravity at a height h above Earth's surface is given by g = g0 * (R/(R + h))², where g0 is 9.81 m/s².

So, for h =300 km, R=6400 km.

So, R/(R + h) = 6400/(6700) = 0.9552.

So, (0.9552)^2 = 0.9124.

So, g = 9.81 * 0.9124.

Compute that: 9.81 * 0.9124.

Let me compute 9.81 * 0.9 = 8.829.

9.81 * 0.0124 = 0.1219.

So, total is 8.829 + 0.1219 = 8.9509 m/s².

So, approximately 8.95 m/s². So, 8.95 is closer to 9.0, but perhaps the commonly known value is 8.68.

Wait, perhaps I should verify using an online calculator.

Wait, but as I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my calculations.

So, according to my calculations, the gravitational acceleration at 300 km is approximately 8.94 m/s². So, the closest option is F:8.9 m/s².

So, the answer should be F.
</think>

The problem asks for the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle at an altitude of 300 km. To solve this, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration at a distance \( r \) from Earth's center:

\[
g = g_0 \left( \frac{R}{R + h} \right)^2
\]

where:
- \( g_0 = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (gravitational acceleration at Earth's surface),
- \( R = 6400 \, \text{km} \) (Earth's radius),
- \( h = 300 \, \text{km} \) (altitude of the Space Shuttle).

### Step 1: Calculate \( \frac{R}{R + h} \)
\[
\frac{R}{R + h} = \frac{6400}{6400 + 300} = \frac{6400}{6700} \approx 0.9552
\]

### Step 2: Square the Ratio
\[
\left( \frac{R}{R + h} \right)^2 = (0.9552)^2 \approx 0.9124
\]

### Step 3: Apply the Formula
\[
g = 9.81 \times 0.9124 \approx 8.95 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The closest option to \( 8.95 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is **F: 8.9 m/s²**.

### Conclusion
The gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle at 300 km altitude is approximately 8.9 m/s², which corresponds to option **F**.

ANSWER: F
