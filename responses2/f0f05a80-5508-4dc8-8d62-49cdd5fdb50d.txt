Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Statement 1| The back-propagation algorithm learns a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers. Statement 2| The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line.

Options:

A: False, False
B: True, True
C: False, True
D: True, False

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about neural networks and VC dimension. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives two statements and asks whether they're true or false. The options are A to J, but the answer format here is A to D, where each option is a pair of two letters (like A is False, False). Wait, no, looking again, the choices are:

A: False, False
B: True, True
C: False, True
D: True, False

So each option is a pair of two answers, each being True or False.

Statement 1: "The back-propagation algorithm learns a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers." Hmm. I remember back-propagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks, but I think it's more about finding a locally optimal solution, not necessarily the globally best one. Oh wait, sometimes people use backpropagation in a way that can get stuck in local minima. So does it learn the globally optimal network? Probably not. It's just a method to find a good solution, not necessarily the absolute best. So Statement 1 is False.

Statement 2: "The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line." VC dimension is a measure of the capacity of a model, indicating the maximum number of points that can be shattered by it. For a linear classifier, like a line, shattering three points would mean that for any three points, you can find a line that separates them into two classes. But wait, if you have three points on a straight line, any two are colinear, so any two points can be separated, but three points on a line can't be shattered because you can't separate them into two classes in all possible ways. For example, if the three points are on a straight line, you can't find a line that places two points in one class and one in another for all possible combinations. So indeed, a line can't shatter three points. So the VC dimension is 2, which is correct. So Statement 2 is True.

Putting it together, Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is True. Looking at the options, option C is False, True; option D is True, False. So the correct answer should be C: False, True.

The first statement is false because back-propagation doesn't guarantee a globally optimal neural network. The second statement is true as a line's VC dimension is indeed 2. Therefore, the correct option is C: False, True.

Answer: C
