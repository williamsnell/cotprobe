Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Doppler effect and echoes. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a police car's driver hearing an echo from a wall. The car is moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s. The speed of sound is given as 350 m/s, and the siren frequency is 600 Hz. I need to find the frequency the driver hears. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the closest one.

Wait, I remember the Doppler effect formula. Oh right, when the source and observer are moving towards each other, the observed frequency increases. And the formula is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs), where v is the speed of sound, vo is the observer's speed, and vs is the source's speed towards the observer. But wait, in this case, the source is the police car, and the observer is the driver. So the source is moving towards the observer (the wall), and the observer is also moving towards the source (the car, since the car is moving towards the wall).

Wait, no. Wait, in this scenario: the police car is moving towards the wall. So the driver is on the car, moving towards the wall. So the sound is coming from the car towards the wall. But when the sound reflects off the wall, it's the driver (the observer) who is moving towards the wall as the sound is reflected.

Wait, so the observed frequency is due to two things: the movement of the source (the car) towards the wall, and the movement of the observer (the driver) towards the wall. So the formula would combine both.

So the standard Doppler effect formula for a moving source and a moving observer is a bit more complex. Wait, the general formula is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs), where vo is the observer moving towards the source (so positive), and vs is the source moving towards the observer (so positive as well, since the source is the car moving towards the wall).

Wait, let me get this straight. The driver is moving towards the wall, so his speed is 3.5 m/s towards the wall. The wall is stationary. So the source (the car) is moving towards the wall (the observer is moving towards the wall as well? Wait, no. Wait, the observer is the driver, who's on the car. The car is moving towards the wall, so the source is moving towards the wall. The observer is moving towards the wall as well, because the car is moving towards the wall.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The police car is moving towards the wall. The driver is in the car, moving towards the wall. The wall is stationary. So the sound is coming from the car (moving towards the wall) and reflecting off the wall. The driver is the observer, moving towards the wall. So both the source (car) and the observer (driver) are moving towards the wall.

Wait, but the formula for the Doppler effect when both the source and observer are moving towards each other is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs). Here, vs is the speed of the source (car) towards the observer (wall). Vo is the observer (driver) moving towards the source (wall).

Wait, wait, maybe I should write down the variables.

f is the actual frequency of the source: 600 Hz.

v is the speed of sound: 350 m/s.

The source (the car) is moving towards the observer (the driver), so vo = +3.5 m/s (since the observer is moving towards the source).

The observer (driver) is moving towards the source, so vs is the speed of the source. Wait, no. Wait, the source is the car, moving towards the observer. So when the source moves towards the observer, the formula would have the denominator as (v - vs), where vs is the source's speed towards the observer. So in this case, vs = 3.5 m/s.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The general Doppler shift formula when both the source and observer are moving towards each other is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs). Here, vo is the observer's speed towards the source, and vs is the source's speed towards the observer.

So in this case, vo = 3.5 m/s (the driver is moving towards the wall, which is the source's direction). And vs is 3.5 m/s (the car is moving towards the wall, so it's moving towards the observer).

So plugging in the numbers:

f' = 600 * (350 + 3.5) / (350 - 3.5)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

350 + 3.5 = 353.5

350 - 3.5 = 346.5

So f' = 600 * (353.5 / 346.5 )

Calculate 353.5 / 346.5. Let me do that.

346.5 * 1.022 is about 353.5? Let me compute 346.5 * 1.022.

346.5 * 1 = 346.5.

346.5 * 0.02 = 6.93.

346.5 * 0.002 = 0.693.

Adding: 346.5 + 6.93 = 353.43; +0.693 = 354.123. Hmm, that's a bit over 353.5. So 346.5 * 1.022 ≈ 354.123, which is a bit higher than 353.5. So the ratio is a bit less than 1.022.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 353.5 / 346.5 = ?

Let me compute 353.5 / 346.5.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3.5: numerator becomes 101, denominator 99.

So 101 / 99 ≈ 1.0202.

Wait, 99 × 1.0202 = 99 × (1 + 0.0202) = 99 + 99 * 0.0202 = 99 + 2.0 = 101. So that's correct. So 101/99 ≈ 1.020202.

So 353.5 / 346.5 ≈ 1.0202.

So f' ≈ 600 * 1.0202 = 612.12 Hz.

Looking at the options, option F is 612 Hz. So the answer should be F.

To determine the frequency heard by the driver, we use the Doppler effect formula for a moving source and a moving observer: 

\[
f' = f \cdot \frac{v + v_o}{v - v_s}
\]

Here:
- \( f = 600 \, \text{Hz} \) (frequency of the siren),
- \( v = 350 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of sound),
- \( v_o = 3.5 \, \text{m/s} \) (observer's speed towards the source),
- \( v_s = 3.5 \, \text{m/s} \) (source's speed towards the observer).

Substituting the values:

\[
f' = 600 \cdot \frac{350 + 3.5}{350 - 3.5}
\]

First, calculate the numerator and denominator:

\[
350 + 3.5 = 353.5, \quad 350 - 3.5 = 346.5
\]

Thus:

\[
f' = 600 \cdot \frac{353.5}{346.5}
\]

Simplify the ratio:

\[
\frac{353.5}{346.5} \approx 1.0202
\]

Now calculate:

\[
f' = 600 \cdot 1.0202 \approx 612.12 \, \text{Hz}
\]

The closest option to \( 612.12 \, \text{Hz} \) is \( 612 \, \text{Hz} \), which corresponds to option F.
