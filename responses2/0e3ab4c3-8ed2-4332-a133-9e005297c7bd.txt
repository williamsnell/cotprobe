Okay, so I've got this physics problem about finding the resistance of a cylindrical resistor made of carbon. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the formulas, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question gives me some dimensions: inner radius R_i is 0.2 mm, outer radius R_o is 0.3 mm. The length of the resistor L is 0.9 mm. Resistivity is given as rho = 3.5e-5 ohm-meters. The answer needs to be in ohm-meters.

Wait, the formula for resistance in a cylinder. I remember that resistance depends on the material's resistivity, the length of the resistor, and the cross-sectional area. Oh right, the formula is R = rho * (L / A), where A is the cross-sectional area.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The cross-sectional area for a cylinder is a circle, so A = pi * R^2. But wait, since the resistor is a hollow cylinder, the actual area is the area of the outer circle minus the inner circle. So A = pi*(R_o^2 - R_i^2).

But wait, wait. Sometimes the cross-sectional area for a resistance is considered as the area of the material. But in this case, the resistor is hollow, so the material is the area between R_i and R_o. So the cross-section is the annulus. So the area is the area of the outer circle minus the inner circle.

So calculating that:

R_i = 0.2 mm = 0.0002 m. R_o =0.3 mm = 0.0003 m.

Wait, converting mm to meters is needed because resistivity is in ohm-meters. So R_i = 0.2 mm = 0.0002 meters, R_o = 0.3 mm = 0.0003 meters.

So the area A = pi * (R_o^2 - R_i^2) = pi * ( (0.0003)^2 - (0.0002)^2 ) .

Let me compute that.

First, compute (0.0003)^2: 0.0003 is 3e-4, so squared is 9e-8. Similarly, (0.0002)^2 is 4e-8. The difference is 5e-8. Multiply by pi: A = pi * 5e-8 = approx 1.57e-7 m².

Wait, wait, 5e-8 * pi is about 1.57e-7? Let me check: 5e-8 is 0.00000005. Multiply by pi: 0.00000005 *3.1416≈1.57e-7. Yep.

So the cross-sectional area A is approximately 1.57e-7 m².

Now the length L is 0.9 mm = 0.0009 meters.

Resistance R = rho * (L / A).

Wait, substituting the numbers: rho is 3.5e-5 ohm-m. L is 0.0009 m.

So R = (3.5e-5) * (0.0009 / 1.57e-7).

Wait, let's compute that step by step. Compute 0.0009 / 1.57e-7. Let's see:

0.0009 is 9e-4. 1.57e-7 is 1.57e-7. So 9e-4 / 1.57e-7 = (9/1.57) * 1e3 ≈ 5.732 * 1e3 ≈ 5732.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 9e-4 / 1.57e-7 = (9 / 1.57) * (1e-4 / 1e-7) )= (approx 5.732) * 1e3 = 5732. So that's about 5732.

Multiply by rho, which is 3.5e-5: 3.5e-5 * 5732 = ?

Hmm, 5732 * 3.5e-5. Let me compute 5732 * 3.5 = 20062, then times 1e-5 is 0.20062 ohm meters.

Wait, but the options are in whole numbers. So 0.20062 is approximately 0.2 ohm-m. But that's not matching any of the options. The options are all integers.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through again.

Wait, R = rho * L / A.

Wait, R = (3.5e-5) ohm-m * (0.0009 m) / (1.57e-7 m²).

Wait, let me compute the denominator first: 1.57e-7 m².

So, 0.0009 m / 1.57e-7 m² = (0.0009) / (1.57e-7) = (9e-4) / (1.57e-7) )= (9/1.57) * 1e3 ≈ 5.732 * 1000 ≈ 5732 m⁻¹.

So, R = 3.5e-5 * 5732.

Compute 3.5e-5 * 5732.

Let me compute 3.5e-5 * 5732 = (3.5 *5732) *1e-5.

3.5 *5732: 5732 *3=17196, 5732 *0.5=2866. So 17196 +2866=20062.

So 20062 * 1e-5 = 2.0062 ohm-m.

Wait, but the options are all whole numbers. So 2.0062 is approximately 2 ohm-m. Looking at the options, option D is 2.0.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Did I compute the cross-sectional area correctly? Because sometimes, the formula for resistance for a cylinder is R = rho * L / A, where A is the area. So in this case, the cross-section is the annulus, so A = pi (R_o^2 - R_i^2). I think I did that correctly.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again.

R_i = 0.2 mm = 0.0002 m.

R_o = 0.3 mm = 0.0003 m.

So R_i^2 = (0.0002)^2 = 4e-8 m².

R_o^2 = (0.0003)^2 =9e-8 m².

R_o² - R_i² =5e-8 m².

Multiply by pi: 5e-8 * 3.1416 ≈ 1.5708e-7 m².

So that's correct.

Hmm, so R = (3.5e-5) * (0.0009) / (1.5708e-7).

Wait, 0.0009 is 9e-4.

So (9e-4) / (1.5708e-7) = 9e-4 / 1.5708e-7 = 9/(1.5708) * 1e3.

Compute 9/1.5708: 1.5708 is approx 1.57. 9/1.57 is about 5.732.

So 5.732 * 1e3 =5732.

Then multiply by 3.5e-5: 5732 *3.5e-5.

Wait, 5732 *3.5 = let me compute that.

3.5 is the same as 3 + 0.5.

5732 *3 = 17196.

5732 *0.5=2866.

Sum: 17196 +2866=20062.

So 20062 *1e-5 = 2.0062 ohm-m.

So the resistance is approximately 2.006 ohm-m. Looking at the options, option D is 2.0.

Wait, but wait... The options are:

A:4, B:3, C:5, D:2, E:2.8, F:1.5, G:2.5, H:3.5, I:1.8, J:1.0.

So option D is 2.0, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but did I make any miscalculations? Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, another thought: Wait, the cross-sectional area is pi*(R_o² - R_i²), which I think is correct because it's the annulus. But another way to calculate R is using the formula for a wire, which is R = (rho * L) / A, where A is the area.

Alternatively, I could have considered the resistance of a hollow cylinder as the sum of two resistances: the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder. Wait, but in reality, it's a single material. So the formula I used is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute R = (rho * L) / (pi (R_o^2 - R_i^2)).

Which is exactly what I did.

Hmm, yes, I think that's correct.

So the answer should be 2.0 ohm-m, option D.

To determine the resistance of the cylindrical resistor made of carbon, we use the formula for resistance in a material:

\[
R = \rho \cdot \frac{L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material (\( 3.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \)),
- \( L \) is the length of the resistor (\( 0.9 \, \text{mm} = 0.0009 \, \text{m} \)),
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the annulus (the hollow part of the cylinder).

### Step 1: Calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \)
The cross-sectional area is given by the area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner circle:

\[
A = \pi \left( R_o^2 - R_i^2 \right)
\]

Given:
- \( R_i = 0.2 \, \text{mm} = 0.0002 \, \text{m} \),
- \( R_o = 0.3 \, \text{mm} = 0.0003 \, \text{m} \),

we compute:
\[
R_i^2 = (0.0002)^2 = 4 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}^2, \quad R_o^2 = (0.0003)^2 = 9 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Thus:
\[
A = \pi \left( 9 \times 10^{-8} - 4 \times 10^{-8} \right) = \pi \cdot 5 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}^2 \approx 1.57 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the resistance \( R \)
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
R = \rho \cdot \frac{L}{A} = (3.5 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot \frac{0.0009}{1.57 \times 10^{-7}}.
\]

First, compute the ratio:
\[
\frac{0.0009}{1.57 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{9 \times 10^{-4}}{1.57 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{9}{1.57} \cdot 10^3 \approx 5.732 \cdot 10^3 = 5732.
\]

Now multiply by \( \rho \):
\[
R = (3.5 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 5732 = 3.5 \cdot 5732 \cdot 10^{-5}.
\]

Compute \( 3.5 \cdot 5732 \):
\[
3.5 \cdot 5732 = 20062.
\]

Thus:
\[
R = 20062 \cdot 10^{-5} = 2.0062 \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated resistance is approximately \( 2.0062 \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \), which is closest to \( 2.0 \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \) (option D).
