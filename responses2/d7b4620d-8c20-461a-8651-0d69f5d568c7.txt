Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of integers n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 25, such that n² + 3n + 2 is divisible by 6. The options are A through J, with various numbers. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that if a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. So I can approach this by checking when n² + 3n + 2 is divisible by 2 and by 3 separately, and then see where both conditions are satisfied.

Let's start with divisibility by 2. For n² + 3n + 2 to be even, each term needs to contribute in a way that the sum is even. Let's analyze each term:

n²: If n is even, n² is even. If n is odd, n² is odd.
3n: If n is even, 3n is even. If n is odd, 3n is odd.
2: 2 is even.

So adding these up:

If n is even:
n² (even) + 3n (even) + 2 (even) = even + even + even = even. So divisible by 2.

If n is odd:
n² (odd) + 3n (odd) + 2 (even) = odd + odd + even = even. So also divisible by 2.

Wait, that's interesting. So regardless of whether n is even or odd, n² + 3n + 2 is always even. So it's always divisible by 2. So that condition is always satisfied. So we don't have to worry about that anymore.

Now, let's check divisibility by 3. For the sum to be divisible by 3, n² + 3n + 2 must be congruent to 0 modulo 3.

Let me compute each term modulo 3.

n² mod 3: The squares modulo 3 are 0,1,1. Because:
0²=0, 1²=1, 2²=4≡1 mod3.

3n mod3: Since 3 is a multiple of 3, 3n is 0 mod3 for any n.

2 mod3: That's 2.

So the entire expression mod3 is:

n² + 0 + 2 ≡ n² + 2 mod3.

We need this to be congruent to 0 mod3, so:

n² + 2 ≡ 0 mod3 → n² ≡ 1 mod3.

Because 1 + 2 =3 ≡0 mod3.

So when is n² ≡1 mod3?

Let's check n=0,1,2 mod3:

n=0: 0²=0 → 0 mod3 → not 1.
n=1: 1²=1 →1 mod3 → yes.
n=2: 4 mod3 is 1 → yes.

So for n ≡1 or 2 mod3, n² ≡1 mod3. Thus, n² +2 ≡0 mod3 in those cases.

So the expression is divisible by 3 when n is not divisible by 3, i.e., when n ≡1 or 2 mod3.

So overall, the expression is divisible by 6 when n is such that it's not divisible by 3, i.e., n ≡1 or 2 mod3.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So n² +3n +2 is always even, so that's good. And for divisibility by 3, n must not be divisible by 3. So the values of n we are looking for are those not divisible by 3.

So now, the problem reduces to counting the numbers between 1 and 25 inclusive that are not divisible by 3.

Total numbers:25.

Numbers divisible by3: Let's find how many multiples of 3 are between 1 and25.

The multiples are 3,6,9,..., up to the maximum less than or equal to25.

The largest multiple is 24 (since 3×8=24). So the count is 8.

So numbers not divisible by3:25-8=17.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the count of multiples of3 up to25.

Numbers:3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24. That's 8 numbers. So 25-8=17. So the answer is 17.

Looking at the options, option I is 17. So the answer should be I:17.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Did I miss something?

Alternatively, I can compute the numbers not divisible by3 by considering the pattern. For every 3 consecutive numbers, 2 are not divisible by3. So in 25 numbers, how many groups of 3 are there? 8 groups (3×8=24), and the last number is25, which is the start of the 9th group (25 is 3×8 +1=25). So in each group, 2 are not divisible by3. So 8×2=16, plus the first number of the 9th group (25) which is not divisible by3. So 16+1=17. That matches.

So yes, the correct count is17, which is option I.

The expression n² + 3n + 2 is always even and divisible by 3 when n is not divisible by 3. Between 1 and 25, there are 8 multiples of 3. Thus, the numbers not divisible by 3 are 25 - 8 = 17.
