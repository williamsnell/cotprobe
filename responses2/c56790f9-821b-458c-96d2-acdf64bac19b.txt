Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the compound annual return over three years. The returns for the stock are given for 2018, 2019, and 2020. Let me think about how to approach this.

The formula for compound annual return, or the geometric mean rate, is usually calculated using the product of the growth factors each year. Alternatively, since the returns are given in percentages, I can convert them into decimal form first.

Wait, the formula for the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is:

( (1 + r1) * (1 + r2) * (1 + r3) )^(1/3) - 1

Where r1, r2, r3 are the annual returns for each year. But wait, I should be careful with the signs because negative returns can complicate things.

Looking at the given data:
2018: 2.45% → 1.0245
2019:5.42% →1.0542
2020:-13.83% → 0.8617 (because 1 - 0.1383 = 0.8617)

So the product would be 1.0245 * 1.0542 * 0.8617. Let me calculate that step by step.

First, multiply 1.0245 and 1.0542. Let me do that. 1.0245 * 1.0542. Hmm, 1.0245 is approximately 1.0245, and 1.0542 is around 1.0542.

Calculating 1.0245 * 1.0542:

1.0245 * 1.0542 = ?

Let me compute that. 1.0245 * 1 = 1.0245, 1.0245 * 0.0542 = ?

0.0542 * 1.0245. Let's compute 0.05 * 1.0245 = 0.051225. 0.0042 * 1.0245 ≈ 0.0043089. So total is approximately 0.055534. So the product is 1.0245 + 0.055534 = 1.080034.

Now multiply this by 0.8617. So 1.080034 * 0.8617.

Hmm, 1.080034 * 0.8617 is approximately...

Let's compute 1 * 0.8617 = 0.8617. 0.08 * 0.8617 = 0.068936. 0.000034 * 0.8617 ≈ 0.000029. So adding those: 0.8617 + 0.068936 = 0.930636 + 0.000029 ≈ 0.930665.

Wait, but wait, that's before the square root and all. So the product is approximately 0.930665. Then we take the cube root of that to get the annual rate.

So the cube root of 0.930665. Let's think about what that is. Cube root of 1 is 1. Cube root of 0.8 is about 0.9283. So 0.930665 is a bit higher than 0.9283. So the cube root would be a bit less than 0.9283. Wait, wait no, because 0.930665 is larger than 1. So wait, cube root of 1 is 1. Let me think again. The cube root of 0.930665 is around 0.975 or so? Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, 0.930665 is less than 1. So the cube root would be less than 1. Let me think, 0.97^3 is approximately 0.912673 (since 0.97 * 0.97 is 0.9409, then 0.9409 * 0.97 ≈ 0.912673). And 0.98^3 is 0.941192. Hmm, wait, but 0.930665 is less than 0.941192, meaning the cube root is greater than 0.98. Wait, no, that can't be. Because 0.98^3 is about 0.9412, which is higher than 0.930665. So, 0.98^3 = 0.9412. So 0.930665 is less than that, so cube root is a bit less than 0.98.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the product correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the multiplication steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.0245 * 1.0542 * 0.8617 in another way.

Let me compute 1.0245 * 1.0542:

1.0245 * 1.0542 = ?

Let me break it down. 1.0245 * 1 = 1.0245. 1.0245 * 0.0542:

Compute 0.0542 * 1.0245.

0.05 * 1.0245 = 0.051225.

0.0042 * 1.0245 = 0.0043089.

So total is 0.0555339.

So 1.0245 * 1.0542 = 1.0245 + 0.0555339 = 1.0799339.

Now multiply by 0.8617.

1.0799339 * 0.8617. Let's compute 1.0799339 * 0.8617.

I can think of this as approximately 1.08 * 0.86. Let's compute 1.08 * 0.86.

1.08 * 0.8 = 0.864. 1.08 * 0.06 = 0.0648. So 0.864 + 0.0648 = 0.9288. But wait, 1.0799339 is a bit less than 1.08, and 0.8617 is a bit less than 0.86.

Wait, perhaps using more precise calculation would help.

1.0799339 * 0.8617.

Let me compute 1 * 0.8617 = 0.8617.

0.0799339 * 0.8617.

Compute 0.07 * 0.8617 = 0.060319.

0.0099339 * 0.8617 ≈ 0.008553.

So sum: 0.060319 + 0.008553 = 0.068872.

So total product: 0.8617 + 0.068872 ≈ 0.930572.

So the product of the growth factors is approximately 0.930572.

Now, to find the geometric mean, we take the cube root of that. Since it's 3 years, we take the 3rd root.

Cube root of 0.930572.

Let me think about what number cubed gives about 0.93.

I know that 0.97^3 is approximately 0.912673. 0.98^3 is about 0.941192. 0.99^3 is 0.970299. So 0.97^3 is 0.912673, which is less than 0.930572.

0.98^3 is 0.941192, which is higher than 0.930572. So the cube root is between 0.97 and 0.98.

Let me calculate 0.975^3. 975 is 0.975.

0.975^3 = (975/1000)^3 = (39/40)^3 = (39^3)/(40^3).

39^3: 39 * 39 = 1521, 1521 *39= 59271.

40^3 = 64000.

So 59271 / 64000 ≈ 0.925798.

Which is 0.9258, still a bit less than 0.930572.

So 0.975^3 ≈ 0.9258.

What about 0.976^3.

Hmm, perhaps using linear approximation between 0.975 and 0.98.

We have:

At x=0.975, f(x)=0.9258.

At x=0.98, f(x)=0.941192.

We need x where f(x)=0.930572.

The difference between f(0.975) and f(0.98) is about 0.941192 - 0.9258 = 0.015392.

The target f is 0.930572, which is 0.930572 - 0.9258 = 0.004772 above f(0.975).

So the fraction is 0.004772 / 0.015392 ≈ 0.31.

So x ≈ 0.975 + 0.31 * (0.98-0.975) = 0.975 + 0.31 * 0.005 ≈ 0.975 + 0.00155 ≈ 0.97655.

So the cube root is approximately 0.97655. Let's round to four decimal places: 0.9766.

Wait, but wait, the cube root is 0.9766. So the compound annual growth rate is (0.9766 - 1) = -0.0234. So approximately -2.34%.

Looking at the options, option E is -0.023669, which is about -2.3669%. So that's close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an error in the multiplication steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial product. Let me recalculate 1.0245 * 1.0542 * 0.8617.

Wait, 1.0245 * 1.0542 = ?

Let me compute that again. 1.0245 * 1.0542.

Breaking it down: 1 * 1.0542 = 1.0542.

0.0245 * 1.0542 = ?

0.02 * 1.0542 = 0.021084.

0.0045 * 1.0542 = 0.00474405.

So 0.021084 + 0.00474405 = 0.025828.

So total 1.0542 + 0.025828 = 1.079928.

Now multiply by 0.8617.

1.079928 * 0.8617.

Let me compute 1.079928 * 0.8 = 0.8639424.

1.079928 * 0.06 = 0.06479568.

1.079928 * 0.0017 = approx 0.001835878.

Adding these: 0.8639424 + 0.06479568 = 0.92873808. Then add 0.001835878 → 0.930573958.

So the product is approximately 0.930574.

So cube root is what? Let me compute.

Another approach: Let’s compute r such that (1 + r)^3 = 0.930574.

We can take the cube root.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms or another method. But perhaps I should think about using a calculator.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, 0.9766 cubed is:

0.9766^3 = (approx) let me compute.

0.976^3:

0.976 * 0.976 = 0.952576.

0.952576 * 0.976 = ?

Approximate:

0.952576 * 0.976 → let me compute 0.952576 * 0.976.

0.952576 * 0.9 = 0.8573184.

0.952576 * 0.07 = 0.06668032.

0.952576 * 0.006 = 0.005715456.

Add them: 0.8573184 + 0.06668032 = 0.92399872. Then add 0.005715456 → 0.929714176.

So 0.976^3 is approximately 0.929714.

But our target is 0.930574, which is a bit higher.

So 0.976^3 = 0.929714.

0.976^3 = 0.929714 → 0.929714.

Our target is 0.930574, which is 0.00086 higher.

So each small increase in x (from 0.976) would increase x^3 by about 3*(0.976)^2 * dx.

Compute dx needed.

We have (0.976 + dx)^3 ≈ 0.929714 + 3*(0.976)^2 * dx.

We need 0.929714 + 3*(0.976)^2 * dx = 0.930574.

So 3*(0.976)^2 * dx = 0.930574 - 0.929714 = 0.00086.

So dx ≈ 0.00086 / (3*(0.952576)).

Compute 3 * 0.952576 = 2.857728.

dx ≈ 0.00086 / 2.857728 ≈ 0.0003005.

So x ≈ 0.976 + 0.0003005 ≈ 0.9763.

So the cube root is approximately 0.9763.

Thus, the CAGR is 0.9763 - 1 = -0.0237.

Looking at the options, option E is -0.023669, which is approximately -0.02367. Our calculation is -0.0237, which is very close. I might have made a slight approximation, but the answer should be E.

Wait, but another approach: let's compute the exact cube.

If I take 0.9763^3:

0.9763 * 0.9763 = ?

Let me compute 0.9763^2:

0.9763 * 0.9763.

Multiply each digit:

9763 * 9763 → but perhaps I'll use a calculator approach.

9763 * 9763:

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 9763^2 = (9700 + 63)^2.

= 9700² + 2*9700*63 + 63².

9700² = (97)^2 * (100)^2 = 9409 * 10000 = 94,090,000.

2*9700*63 = 2*9700 = 19,400; 19,400 *63.

Let me compute 19,400 * 60 = 1,164,000 and 19,400 *3=58,200. So total 1,164,000 +58,200 = 1,222,200.

63² = 3,969.

So 9700^2 + 2*9700*63 +63^2 = 94,090,000 + 1,222,200 +3,969 = 95,316,169.

So 9763^2 = 95,316,169.

Now multiply by 0.9763 again. Wait, perhaps that's too time-consuming. Let me think if I can find a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is option E, which is -0.023669, as that's the closest to our calculated -0.0237.
</think>

To calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over three years, we use the formula:

\[
\text{CAGR} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{(1 + r_1)(1 + r_2)(1 + r_3)}{1}}
\]

Here, the given returns for the three years are:

- \( r_1 = 2.45\% = 0.0245 \)
- \( r_2 = 5.42\% = 0.0542 \)
- \( r_3 = -13.83\% = -0.1383 \)

Converting the returns to growth factors:

\[
(1 + r_1) = 1.0245, \quad (1 + r_2) = 1.0542, \quad (1 + r_3) = 0.8617
\]

Calculating the product of the growth factors:

\[
1.0245 \times 1.0542 \times 0.8617 = 0.930574
\]

Taking the cube root to find the CAGR:

\[
\sqrt[3]{0.930574} \approx 0.9763
\]

Thus, the CAGR is:

\[
0.9763 - 1 = -0.0237
\]

From the options provided, the closest value to -0.0237 is:

**E) -0.023669**
