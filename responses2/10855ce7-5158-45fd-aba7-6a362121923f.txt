Okay, so I have this question about the concept of 'natural law' appearing in different historical periods. The options are A: French Revolution, B: American War of Independence, C: Roman Law, D: Greek Thinking. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

First, I remember that natural law is a philosophical concept that dates back to ancient times. The idea is that everything is created equal and that fairness is inherent in the law. I think the ancient Greeks had a concept of natural law, but I'm not exactly sure when. Maybe it was around the time of the Ionian School or something.

The options include the Roman Law, which I know was a system of law based on Roman law codes. But I don't think natural law was the first concept to appear in ancient times. The Roman Law, as far as I remember, was about how to handle different types of law, not the philosophical idea of natural law.

The American War of Independence happened in 1776, during the French Revolution. The French Revolution was a big event in the early modern period, starting in 1688. The idea of natural law was certainly there before the French Revolution, probably in ancient Greece.

Greek thinking, option D, might include various philosophical ideas, including the concept of natural law. But I'm not certain if it's the first. The Roman Law is more about law systems, not philosophical law.

So, putting it together, the first occurrence of the idea of natural law would be in ancient Greek philosophy, possibly with the Ionian school or earlier.
