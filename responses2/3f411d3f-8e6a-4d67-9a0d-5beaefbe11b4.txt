Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about interference patterns from two slits. Hmm, I remember this is the double-slit experiment. Let me try to recall what I learned.

The question says two narrow slits separated by 0.10 mm are illuminated by light of wavelength 600 nm. Then, a detector is placed 2.00 m beyond the slits, and we need to find the distance between the central maximum and the first maximum.

Wait, right, the formula for the maxima in double-slit interference is something like d sinθ = mλ, where d is the slit separation, m is the order of the maximum, and λ is the wavelength. Oh, right, and θ is the angle from the central maximum. But when the detector is far away, we can approximate sinθ as tanθ, because for small angles, sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ y/L, where y is the distance from the central maximum to the maximum, and L is the distance from the slits to the detector.

So in this case, the first maximum is m=1. So the formula becomes d*(y/L) = mλ. Solving for y, y = (mλL)/(d).

Let me plug in the numbers. The slit separation d is 0.10 mm, which is 0.10e-3 meters. The wavelength λ is 600 nm, which is 600e-9 meters. L is 2.00 meters.

So y = (1 * 600e-9 m * 2.00 m) / (0.10e-3 m) )

Let me calculate that step by step. The numerator is 600e-9 * 2 = 1200e-9. Denominator is 0.1e-3, which is 1e-4.

So 1200e-9 divided by 1e-4 is (1200 / 1e4) * e-5.

Wait, 1200e-9 is 1.2e-6. So 1.2e-6 / 1e-4 = 1.2e-2. Because 1e-4 is 100e-6.

Wait that's 1.2e-6 / 1e-4 = 0.012 meters, which is 1.2 cm. But wait, the options are in mm, so 1.2 cm is 12 mm. Looking at the options, option F is 12 mm. Hmm, but wait, could I have made a mistake in the exponents?

Wait, let me recalculate. Numerator: 600 nm is 600e-9 m, L is 2 m. So (600e-9 m) * 2 m = 1.2e-6 m².

Denominator: 0.10 mm is 0.1e-3 m. So,

y = (1 * 1.2e-6) / (0.1e-3) = (1.2e-6) / (1e-4 * 0.1) → Wait, 0.1e-3 is 1e-4 m.

Wait no, 0.1 mm is 0.1e-3 meters, which is 1e-4 meters. So denominator is 1e-4 m.

So 1.2e-6 / 1e-4 = (1.2 × 1e-6) / (1e-4) ) → 1.2 × 1e-2 → 0.012 meters. 0.012 m is 12 mm. So the answer should be 12 mm, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options: option F is 12 mm. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I did the formula right. Because sometimes I mix up whether it's y = mλL/d. Oh wait, yes, that's correct. The formula for the position of maxima is d sinθ = mλ, and when θ is small, sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ y/L, so y = (mλ L) / d.

Alternatively, sometimes it's written as y = (m λ D)/d, where D is the distance to the detector. Oh, wait, in the question, L is 2.00 m, which I think is D. So yes, same as the formula. So that part is correct.

Another check: 0.1 mm is 10^-5 m. So d is 1e-5 m.

So y = (1 * 600e-9 * 2 ) / (1e-5) → (1.2e-6) / 1e-5 = (1.2e-6) / 1e-5 = 0.12 m → 120 mm? No wait, no. Wait, 1.2e-6 divided by 1e-5. 

Wait, 1e-5 is 0.00001. 1.2e-6 is 0.0000012. So 0.0000012 / 0.00001 = 120 mm? No, wait 0.0000012 / 0.00001 is 0.12 × (1e-6 / 1e-5) = 0.12 × 0.1 → 0.012 meters, which is 12 mm. Oh right, because 0.012 m is 12 mm. So yes, 12 mm is the answer.

So the correct option is F:12 mm.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the angular position of the maxima in a double-slit interference pattern:

\[
d \sin \theta = m \lambda
\]

For small angles, \(\sin \theta \approx \tan \theta \approx y / L\), where \(y\) is the distance from the central maximum to a maximum, and \(L\) is the distance from the slits to the detector. Substituting this approximation, the formula becomes:

\[
y = \frac{m \lambda L}{d}
\]

### Given Data:
- Slit separation: \(d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}\)
- Wavelength: \(\lambda = 600 \, \text{nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\)
- Distance to the detector: \(L = 2.00 \, \text{m}\)
- Order of the maximum: \(m = 1\)

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
y = \frac{(1)(600 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m})(2.00 \, \text{m})}{1.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(1)(600 \times 10^{-9})(2.00) = 1200 \times 10^{-9} = 1.2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Now, divide by the denominator:

\[
y = \frac{1.2 \times 10^{-6}}{1.0 \times 10^{-4}} = 0.012 \, \text{m} = 12 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Conclusion:
The distance between the central maximum and the first maximum is \(12 \, \text{mm}\), which corresponds to option **F**.
