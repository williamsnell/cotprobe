Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the percentage of sulfur in a tomato. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the tomato weighs 60.0 grams. And when they digest it with concentrated nitric acid (HNO3), the sulfur is converted. Then they precipitate it with barium sulfate (BaSO4), and they get 0.466 grams of that. The question is asking for the percentage of sulfur in the tomato, assuming all the sulfur is converted to BaSO4.

Wait, so the process is: sulfur in the tomato reacts with HNO3, forms some product (maybe H2SO4?), which then reacts with Ba to form BaSO4. Since all sulfur is converted, the amount of BaSO4 is directly related to the sulfur content.

So the steps are probably:

1. Find the moles of BaSO4 produced.
2. Use the molar mass of BaSO4 to find the moles of BaSO4.
3. Since one mole of BaSO4 contains one mole of S, find moles of S.
4. Multiply by the molar mass of sulfur to get grams of S.
5. Divide by the total mass of tomato (60.0g) to get the percentage.

Let me jot this down.

First, moles of BaSO4. The mass is 0.466 grams. The molar mass of BaSO4: Ba is about 137.33 g/mol, S is 32.07, O is 16 each. So 137.33 + 32.07 + (4*16) = 137.33 +32.07 is 169.4, plus 64 (4*16) is 233.4 g/mol.

Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.466 g / 233.4 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.466 divided by 233.4. Let me see, 0.466/233.4 is approximately 0.002000... wait, wait, that's 2.000e-3? Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 233.4 * 0.002 = 0.4668. Oh, so 0.466 g is about 0.002 moles of BaSO4. Because 233.4 * 0.002 = 0.4668, which is very close to 0.466. So that's 0.002 moles of BaSO4.

Each mole of BaSO4 has one mole of S, so 0.002 moles of S.

Now, the molar mass of sulfur is about 32.07 g/mol. So grams of S = 0.002 * 32.07 = ?

0.002 *32 is 0.064, 0.002 *0.07 is 0.00014. So total is 0.06414 grams of sulfur.

Wait, 0.06414 grams of sulfur in 60 grams of tomato. So the percentage is (0.06414 / 60.0) *100.

Let me compute that. 0.06414 /60 = 0.001069. Multiply by 100 gives 0.1069% approximately. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 0.075%, which is lower. Or maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Did I do the calculation correctly? Let me double-check.

BaSO4 molar mass: Ba is 137.33, S 32.07, 4 O's (16 each) → 137.33 +32.07 = 169.4, plus 64 (4×16) → 233.4 g/mol. So 0.466g /233.4g/mol = 0.002 mol BaSO4.

Each BaSO4 has one S atom, so 0.002 mol S.

Sulfur's molar mass is 32.07 g/mol. So 0.002 *32.07 = 0.06414 grams. That's correct.

Tomato mass is 60 grams. So (0.06414 /60)*100 = 0.1069% → approximately 0.107%, which is about 0.107%.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.075% which is lower, and option C is 0.11%, which is close. Wait, but my calculation is about 0.1069%, so 0.107% is roughly 0.11% if rounded to two decimal places. But perhaps the options are given as percentages with more decimal points.

Wait, let me redo the calculation precisely.

Compute 0.466 / 233.4.

Let me do this division accurately.

233.4 × 0.002 = 0.4668. So 0.466 is 0.002 mol minus some. Wait, 0.466 is less than 0.4668. So 0.466 / 233.4 = 0.002 (as I thought) minus (0.0008/233.4) → approximately 0.002 - 0.0000034 = almost 0.0019966 mol.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 0.466 /233.4 → let me compute 0.466 / 233.4.

Calculate 233.4 × x = 0.466 → x = 0.466 /233.4.

Let me do that division: 0.466 ÷ 233.4.

I can write this as 466 /23340000 → but perhaps easier to compute.

Alternatively, 466 ÷ 23340000.

Wait, 233.4 is 23340000 per million, no, wait, maybe 233.4 is 2.334e2. Let me think in terms of decimal places.

Wait, 233.4 is about 233.4 grams/mol.

So 0.466 g / 233.4 g/mol = 0.002 mol.

But wait, 0.466 /233.4 = 0.002 exactly?

Wait, 233.4 × 0.002 = 0.4668, which is a bit larger than 0.466. So 0.466 = 233.4 × 0.002 - 0.0008.

So 0.466 = 233.4 × 0.002 - (0.0008) → 0.0008 is 233.4 × 3.8e-6. So 0.002 mol is 0.4668, but we have an excess of 0.0008 grams. 

So moles would be 0.002 - (0.0008 /233.4) → compute 0.0008 /233.4.

0.0008 /233.4 = approximately 3.42e-6, so 0.002 mol minus 3.42e-6 → approximately 0.00199966 mol.

So about 0.00199966 mol of BaSO4, which is 0.00199966 moles of S.

Sulfur mass: 0.00199966 *32.07.

Let me compute that.

32.07 * 0.002 = 0.06414 → as before.

But wait, the exact value is 32.07 * 0.00199966.

Let me compute 32.07 *0.00199966 ≈ 32.07 *0.002 = 0.06414. So, 0.06414 minus (32.07 *0.00000034) → negligible, so about 0.06414 grams.

Tomato mass is 60 grams. So percentage is (0.06414 /60)*100 → (0.06414 /60)= 0.001069 → 0.1069% → approximately 0.107%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G which is 0.075%, and option C is 0.11%. Hmm, 0.107 is approximately 0.11%, so option C, which is 0.11%, would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps once more.

Wait, the initial calculation: 0.466 g BaSO4 / 233.4 g/mol = 0.002 mol BaSO4 → 0.002 mol S.

Sulfur mass: 0.002 *32.07 = 0.06414 g → 0.06414 /60 = 0.001069 → 0.1069% → 0.107%.

So the correct percentage is approximately 0.107%, which would round to 0.11% or about that.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.11% and option G is 0.075%. So 0.107% is closer to 0.11% but not exactly. Hmm, but in the options, 0.11% is option C, and 0.075% is G, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute 0.466 /233.4 more precisely.

Let me set up the division:

233.4 into 0.466.

So 0.466 ÷ 233.4.

We can write this as 466 ÷ 23340000.

But perhaps another approach: since 233.4 is approximately 2.334e2, 0.466 is 4.66e-1.

So (4.66e-1) / (2.334e2) = (4.66 /233.4 )e-3.

Compute 4.66 /233.4 = ?

Well, 233.4 ÷ 4.66 is about 50 (since 4.66 *50=233). So 4.66/233.4 is approximately 0.02.

Wait, yes: 4.66 /233.4 = approximately 0.02.

So 0.02 *1e-3 → 0.00002.

Wait no, wait. Wait, 4.66 /233.4 = ?

Let me compute 233.4 *0.02 = 4.668 → which is a bit more than 4.66.

So 0.02 is a bit too high. So 4.66 /233.4 = 0.02 - (0.008/233.4) → 0.008 ÷233.4 is about 0.000034.

So 0.02 -0.000034 = 0.019966.

So 0.019966e-3 = 0.000019966.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think in terms of the initial calculation:

0.466 g BaSO4 / 233.4 g/mol = 0.002 mol, but as per precise calculation, it's 0.002 - 0.0008/233.4.

So 0.0008 /233.4 is approximately 3.42e-6.

So moles: 0.002 - 3.42e-6 = approximately 0.00199966 mol.

So, grams of S: 0.00199966 *32.07.

Compute that:

0.00199966 *32 = 0.06398832

0.00199966 *0.07 = 0.0001399762

Add them: 0.06398832 + 0.0001399762 = 0.064128296 ≈ 0.064128 g.

Tomato mass is 60.0 g. So percentage is (0.064128 /60) *100.

0.064128 /60 = 0.0010688.

Multiply by 100: 0.10688% → approximately 0.107%.

Looking at the options, the closest is 0.11% (option C). However, I notice that some of the options are more precise, but none exactly match 0.107%. Let me look again.

Looking at the options:

A: 0.065% (0.065)

B: 0.18% (0.18)

C: 0.11% (0.11)

D:0.14%

E:0.25%

F:0.032%

G:0.075%

H:0.466%

I:0.5%

J:0.20%

So, 0.107% is closest to 0.11%, which is option C.

Wait a second, but I remember that the molar mass of BaSO4 is 233.39 g/mol.

Let me recalculate using the more precise molar mass.

Ba: 137.33 g/mol

S:32.07 g/mol

O:16 *4 =64.

Total: 137.33 +32.07 = 169.4 +64=233.4 g/mol. So that's correct.

So, 0.466 g /233.4 g/mol = 0.002 mol. So 0.002 *32.07=0.06414 grams of S.

Which is 0.06414/60 = 0.001069 → 0.1069%.

So, why is there an option G at 0.075%? That's 0.075/100 = 0.00075. So 0.00075 *233.4 = 0.17505 grams of BaSO4. Which is more than 0.466 grams. So option G is not correct.

So, the only option close to 0.107% is option C, 0.11%.

But looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be done considering the actual moles based on the mass and molar mass.

Wait another approach: BaSO4's molar mass is 233.39 g/mol.

The amount of BaSO4 is 0.466 grams.

So moles = 0.466 /233.39 = 0.002 mol.

Each BaSO4 has one S atom, so 0.002 mol S.

Molar mass of S is 32.07 g/mol.

So, grams of S: 0.002 *32.07 = 0.06414 grams.

Tomato mass is 60.0 grams.

Percentage is (0.06414 /60) *100 = (0.06414 *100)/60 = 6.414 /60 = 0.1069% → 0.107%.

So, the correct answer is approximately 0.107%, which isn't exactly any of the options provided. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options:

A:0.065% 

B:0.18% 

C:0.11% 

D:0.14% 

E:0.25% 

F:0.032% 

G:0.075% 

H:0.466% 

I:0.5% 

J:0.20% 

So, C is 0.11%, which is the closest to 0.107%. But why is G 0.075%? That would correspond to 0.075 grams of S in 60 grams of tomato, but 0.075 grams is 0.075 g, which is 0.075/60 = 0.00125 → 0.125% which is not 0.075%.

Wait, perhaps the division is done as (0.466 /233.4) *100 → which gives 0.1069%, which is about 0.107%. So the closest option is C (0.11%).

Thus, the correct answer is option C, 0.11%.

To determine the percentage of sulfur in the tomato, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of BaSO₄**:  
   The mass of BaSO₄ is 0.466 g, and its molar mass is 233.4 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of BaSO₄} = \frac{0.466}{233.4} \approx 0.002 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Convert moles of BaSO₄ to moles of S**:  
   Since each mole of BaSO₄ contains one mole of sulfur,  
   \[
   \text{Moles of S} = 0.002 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate mass of sulfur**:  
   The molar mass of sulfur is 32.07 g/mol.  
   \[
