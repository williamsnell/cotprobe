Okay, so I've got this grammar question here, and I need to figure out which statements are true. Let me take it step by step.

The grammar given is S → ( S ) and S → x. So, the start symbol is S, which can produce either a string of parentheses or just an x.

Hmm, first, I should probably break down what each statement is saying.

Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous. Wait, I remember that a grammar is ambiguous if there's more than one parse tree for a given input string. Let me think about this grammar. Since S can derive multiple leftmost or rightmost derivations, maybe that's the case.

Wait, for example, if the string is x, the parse can only happen as S → x. But if the string is, say, (x), then the parse could be S → (S), and then S → x. Alternatively, maybe another way? Wait, no, because S can only produce either a single x or a pair of parentheses around something. So in this case, the string x can only be parsed in one way. But wait, what about (x)? How many ways can that parse?

Let me think: The production S → (S) would generate a pair of parentheses around S. But S can be x. So (x) would be a single production. So for the string (x), it's (S) where S is x. Are there any alternative ways? Like could S be (x) in another way? No, because the only way to get S is either x or a pair of parentheses around S. So no, I don't think there are multiple parse trees for (x), because the S is only x. Wait, perhaps in this case, the grammar is not ambiguous because for any string, the parse is unique. Or is it?

Wait, for example, if the string is ((x)), then how many parse trees are there? Let's see: S → (S), so the first ( is a production. Then S → (S), another ( production. Then S → x. So one way. Could it be another way? Like, could S produce x, then S produce (x) as another production? Does the grammar allow that? Oh wait, looking back, the grammar only allows S → x or S → (S). So in that case, the only way is to have S → (S) at each step. So for ((x)), it's forced to expand each (S) to x, resulting in (x) in each step. So in this case, the parse is unique. So for any string, is the grammar ambiguous?

Wait, but what about the string x itself. That's just S → x, which is unique. So I think the grammar is not ambiguous because there's only one way to parse any string. So statement I is false. Because the grammar is not ambiguous.

Wait, but wait a minute. What if the string is (x)? Then how? It's S → (S) and S → x. So the string is (x), so the first step is (S), which must expand to x. So only one parse. So for any string, there's only one way to parse it. So I think the grammar is not ambiguous. So statement I is false.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of an alternative way to parse. Wait, no, because the only production is either x or (S). So for any string, you can only apply S → x or S → (S) in the first step. So for example, the string x can only be parsed as x. The string (x) can only be parsed as (S) where S is x. So no ambiguity.

Wait, but maybe there are cases where the same string can be parsed in more than one way. Let me think of a different string. Let's say the string is x followed by another x. Or wait, no, the grammar only allows for S → x or S → (S). So the only way is to have S → x and then S → x, but in the grammar, how is that represented? Wait, no, because each S can only produce x or (S). So each step is either x or a pair of parentheses.

Wait, but in the case of multiple x's, like (x x), but I think the grammar doesn't allow for multiple x's in a row. The S can only have a single x or a pair of parentheses, but each x is a separate S.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's get back to the main question.

Statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing. Top-down parsing uses a stack-based approach, starting from the root and breaking down the parse tree. Since the grammar is not ambiguous, and each production is either x or (S), it's a basic form of a context-free grammar. So, top-down parsers can handle this grammar, as there's only one way to parse each string. So statement II is true.

Wait, but wait. Does the grammar allow for multiple derivations for a string? Oh, no, because each time, the production is forced. So, for any string, the parse is unique. So the grammar is unambiguous, so top-down parsing is possible.

Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing. Bottom-up parsing starts by reducing the leftmost symbol to the smallest possible, which in this case would be x. So, in this grammar, the only way to get x is directly, so it's easy. But the problem is, for the case where you have a more complex structure, like (x), how would the parser handle it? Well, the grammar allows S → (S), so when you see a (, you can derive it, but since the S inside is x, which is just another S → x, so it's handled. So the grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing because each step can be processed step by step.

Wait, but wait: the grammar is in terms of context-free productions, which are suitable for both top-down and bottom-up parsers. So, for example, the grammar has a single non-terminal, which is S, and each production is either a single symbol or a pair of parentheses enclosing another S. So, the structure is a tree, and both top-down and bottom-up parsers can handle it.

Wait, but for bottom-up parsing, the approach is to start from the leaves (the symbols, perhaps) and work up. So in this case, the only way to get x is via the S → x production. So, the bottom-up parser would start by identifying x's and then build up the structure.

So, statement III is also true. So, II, III are true, I is false.

Wait, but wait. The question is about whether the grammar is suitable for top-down and/or bottom-up parsing.

Wait, but in the case of ambiguous grammars, maybe the bottom-up parsing would fail, but in this case, the grammar is not ambiguous. So, for top-down, it's okay, as the grammar is unambiguous. So II and III are both true.

Wait, but the question is whether the grammar is suitable for each. So, the statements are:

I. The grammar is ambiguous. → False.

II. Suitable for top-down parsing. → True.

III. Suitable for bottom-up parsing. → True.

Wait, but what if the grammar isn't ambiguous? Because if it's not ambiguous, then it can be parsed in a unique way, so both top-down and bottom-up parsing can proceed without issues.

So, the statements II and III are true. So, the answer would be something that includes II and III.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options:

A: III only and not II → No.

B: II only and not III → No.

C: I only → No.

D: I and II only → No, because I is false.

E: III only → No.

F: Neither I, II, nor III → No, because II and III are true.

Wait, the options are:

A: III only.

B: II only.

C: I only.

D: I and II only.

E: III only.

F: None of I, II, or III.

G: II and III only.

H: II only.

I: I and III only.

J: I, II, and III.

So, in this scenario, statements II and III are true, I is false. So the correct option is G: II and III only.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in evaluating statement I?

Statement I is: The grammar is ambiguous.

Hmm, the grammar is S → (S), S → x. So the only possible derivations are:

Case 1: S → x → x.

But in the S → (S) case, you have (S) → (x).

Wait, but can the grammar derive (x) in more than one way? For example, can you have (x) via S → x and then S → (S), which would produce (x) from (x) → (x) ?

Wait, no. Because S → (S) produces a pair of parentheses around S. So if S is x, then (S) is (x). But if S is (S), then that's a pair of parentheses around another S. So in that case, (S) is (x) → (x) would be ( (x) ), which is a triple parenthesis.

Wait, but actually, each S is just a single x or a pair of parentheses enclosing another S. So for the string (x), it can only be derived as (S) where S is x. Because if S is (S), then S must be x, so (S) would produce (x), which is correct. So, the only way to parse (x) is via (S), with S being x. So no, there's only one way to parse (x), so the grammar is not ambiguous. So statement I is false.

So, back to the options. The correct statements are II (top-down) and III (bottom-up). So the answer would be option G: II and III only.

So, the options are:

Option G: II and III only.

So, the correct answer is G.

The grammar provided is \( S \rightarrow (S) \) and \( S \rightarrow x \). Let’s analyze the statements:

1. **Statement I: The grammar is ambiguous.**

   - An ambiguous grammar has multiple parse trees for some input strings.
   - For any string derived from \( S \), the grammar only allows one unique parse:
     - The string \( x \) can only be derived as \( S \rightarrow x \).
     - The string \( (x) \) can only be derived as \( S \rightarrow (S) \) where \( S \rightarrow x \).
     - Similarly, longer strings like \( (x) \) or \( ((x))) \) have unique parse trees.
   - Since there's only one parse tree for each string, the grammar is **not ambiguous**.  
   - **Conclusion**: Statement I is **false**.

2. **Statement II: The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.**

   - Top-down parsing uses a stack-based approach, starting from the root and breaking down the parse tree.
   - The grammar has a single non-terminal \( S \) and productions \( S \rightarrow x \) or \( S \rightarrow (S) \), which are straightforward for top-down parsing.
   - No ambiguity exists, so a unique parse tree is guaranteed.  
   - **Conclusion**: Statement II is **true**.

3. **Statement III: The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.**

   - Bottom-up parsing starts from the leaves and builds up the parse tree.
   - The only production for \( x \) is \( S \rightarrow x \), which is a single symbol.  
   - For structures like \( (x) \), the parser can derive \( x \) and then combine it with the surrounding parentheses.  
   - The grammar is structured for bottom-up parsing since it allows for a natural progression from individual symbols to complex structures.  
   - **Conclusion**: Statement III is **true**.

- **Final Evaluation**: Statements II and III are true, while I is false.
