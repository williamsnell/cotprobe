Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about protons being accelerated in cancer therapy. The question is asking how much work needs to be done on a particle of mass m to get it up to 0.6c. Hmm, I remember that when you accelerate particles, the work done relates to their kinetic energy. But wait, isn't kinetic energy dependent on velocity, so I can't just use a simple formula like (1/2 mv²) because that's for non-relativistic speeds. Oh right, because at 0.6c, that's pretty significant, so relativistic effects must come into play.

I think the key here is to use the concept of relativistic kinetic energy. Oh right, the total energy is gamma times mc squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The kinetic energy would be the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So the formula would be KE = (gamma - 1) mc².

Gamma is 1 divided by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's plug in v = 0.6c. So v²/c² is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. The square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1 / 0.8, which is 1.25.

So KE = (1.25 -1) mc² = 0.25 mc². Wait, but wait a second. The question is asking for the work done on the particle. Since the particle starts from rest, the work done would equal the kinetic energy gained. So the work done should be 0.25 mc². Looking at the options, option B is 0.25 mc², so that would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What if the question is considering something else, like the work done in accelerating it from rest to 0.6c? Oh, because work is the change in kinetic energy. So yeah, that's exactly what I did. Since the particle starts at rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero. The work done equals the final kinetic energy, which is 0.25 mc². So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the work done on a proton of mass \( m \) to accelerate it to \( 0.6c \), we use relativistic kinetic energy principles. The total energy of the particle is given by \( \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.6c \), we calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

The kinetic energy is then:

\[
KE = (\gamma - 1) mc^2 = (1.25 - 1) mc^2 = 0.25 mc^2
\]

Since the particle starts from rest, the work done equals the kinetic energy gained, which is \( 0.25 mc^2 \). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**B: 0.25mc²**
