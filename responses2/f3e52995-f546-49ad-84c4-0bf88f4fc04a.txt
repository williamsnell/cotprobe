Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a robotic lander going to Mars, and I need to find the acceleration due to gravity there. Hmm, let's see. I think I remember that gravity on Mars is different from Earth, so I'll have to calculate it based on the given data.

The problem gives the weight of the lander on Earth as 3430 N. Wait, weight is mass times gravity, right? So weight (W) equals mass (m) times acceleration due to gravity (g). So W = m * g. Oh, but wait, I don't know the mass of the lander. Oh wait, maybe I don't need the mass because I can find the acceleration on Mars using the gravitational acceleration formula.

Wait, Mars's data is given: radius RM is 3.40e6 meters, and mass MM is 6.42e23 kg. So I probably need to find the acceleration on Mars, am I right?

Right, the acceleration due to gravity on a planet is given by the formula g = G * (M / r²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is its radius. Oh wait, but for Earth, g is (G*M_earth)/(R_earth)^2. So for Mars, it's similar but with different values.

Wait, but do I know the mass of Earth? Because I know the weight on Earth, which is 3430 N. Wait, wait, maybe I don't need the mass of Earth. Because the weight on Earth would be m * g_earth = 3430 N. And on Mars, I think the mass of the lander (m) is the same, but I don't know m. Oh, but maybe I can find the ratio of the accelerations using the masses and radii.

Wait, another approach: since the weight on Earth is 3430 N, that's m * g_earth = 3430. So m = 3430 / g_earth. But I don't know g_earth. Wait, but maybe I can find the gravitational acceleration on Mars using the planetary data given, without needing the mass. Because, perhaps, I can compute it using the ratio of the two accelerations.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the acceleration on Mars using its own gravitational constant and its own mass and radius. Wait, but wait, the gravitational acceleration formula involves the planet's mass and radius, but the mass of the planet is given, but wait, the mass of the Earth is needed for the Earth's g. Hmm, but in this problem, the mass of Earth isn't given; wait, no, wait the problem says the lander is on Mars, and the lander's weight is given on Earth, but the lander's mass is same on Mars. Wait, no, the lander is on Mars, so perhaps the mass of the lander isn't needed here because the weight on Earth is given, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the gravitational acceleration on Mars.

Alternatively, since the weight is 3430 N on Earth, that's m * g_earth =3430. So m = 3430 / g_earth. But I don't know g_earth. Wait, but I remember that g_earth is about 9.8 m/s². But perhaps I can compute it using the Earth's parameters.

Wait, but maybe this is overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem gives me the mass of Mars, but not its radius. Wait, no, the problem says the radius of Mars is given as RM=3.40e6 meters. So Mars's radius is 3.40 million meters. So, to find the acceleration on Mars, g_mars = G * (M_mars / r_mars²).

Alternatively, since I know the weight on Earth, maybe I can compute the mass of the lander, and then use that mass to find the acceleration on Mars. But wait, maybe that's not the right approach because the mass of the lander isn't given. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: the weight on Earth is 3430 N, which is the same as the mass of the lander times Earth's g. So m = 3430 N / g_earth. But since I don't know g_earth, perhaps I should express the acceleration on Mars in terms of the Earth's parameters.

Wait, but another approach: the acceleration on Mars can be found using the formula g = G*M/(r²). So, I can compute this using the given data. Let's compute that.

Wait, but I need to know G, M, and r. G is 6.674e-11 N(m/kg)^2.

M is the mass of Mars, which is 6.42e23 kg.

r is 3.40e6 meters.

So, compute g_mars = G * M / r².

Let me plug in the numbers. 

G =6.674e-11

M=6.42e23 kg

r=3.40e6 m

Compute r squared: (3.40e6)^2 = (3.4e6)^2 = 11.56e12 m² =1.156e13 m².

Now, compute the denominator as r squared: 1.156e13.

So, G*M = 6.674e-11 * 6.42e23.

Let me compute that. 6.674e-11 * 6.42e23 = (6.674 *6.42) )e( -11 +23 )

6.674 *6.42: Let's compute that. 6 *6 is36, 0.674 *6 is 4.044, 6 *0.42=2.52, and 0.674 *0.42 ≈0.283. Adding all together: 36 +4.044=40.044, plus 2.52=42.564, plus 0.283=42.847. So approximately 42.847. So 42.847e12.

So G*M is approximately 4.2847e13 (because 42.847e12 is 4.2847e13).

Wait, wait, 6.674e-11 *6.42e23 = (6.674 *6.42) * 10^(-11+23) )= (approx 42.847) * 10^12 = 4.2847e13.

Then, g_mars = G*M / r² = (4.2847e13) / (1.156e13).

Compute that: 4.2847 /1.156 ≈ let's see. 1.156 *3=3.468. 3.468 is less than 4.2847. 3.468 is 3.468, 4.2847-3.468= 0.8167. So 3.468 is 3. So 3 + (0.8167 /1.156) ≈ 3 + 0.706 ≈3.706. So approximately 3.7 m/s².

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Oh wait, the options start from 3.3. Hmm. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute the numbers.

Compute G*M:

6.674e-11 *6.42e23 = ?

6.674 *6.42 = let me compute more accurately.

6 *6=36, 6 *0.42=2.52, 0.674*6=4.044, 0.674*.42= approx 0.283.

Adding: 36 +2.52=38.52; 4.044 + 0.283=4.327; summing 38.52 +4.327=42.847. So that's correct.

So G*M=42.847e12 =4.2847e13.

r squared is (3.4e6)^2= (3.4)^2 * (1e6)^2=11.56e12 =1.156e13.

So G*M / r² = 4.2847e13 /1.156e13.

4.2847 /1.156 = let's compute that.

1.156 * 3 =3.468. 4.2847-3.468= 0.8167.

So 0.8167 /1.156 ≈0.706.

So 3 + 0.706=3.706, approximately 3.71 m/s².

Hmm, but looking at the options provided, the closest is option G:3.7. Wait, option C is 7.1, which is way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake. Did I compute G*M correctly?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Oh wait, the mass of Mars is given as 6.42e23 kg, and the radius as 3.4e6 m. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm using the formula g = G*M/(r²) which is correct. So why isn't the answer matching any options? The options given are A:3.3, B:2.4, C:7.1, D:6.0, E:6.5, F:4.1, G:3.7, H:5.2, I:4.9, J:5.9.

So 3.71 is approximately option G which is 3.7. So why isn't it matching the options, or perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the calculation.

Wait, another approach: compute the acceleration on Earth and Mars. Because the weight on Earth is given, and the mass is the same. Let me compute the mass of the lander using Earth's parameters.

Wait, weight on Earth is 3430 N, so mass m= W/g_earth. But I don't know g_earth. Wait, but I can compute g_earth using Earth's data. Wait, but I don't have Earth's radius. Oh, wait, Earth's radius isn't given here. So perhaps that's not the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Since the mass is the same on both Earth and Mars, and the weight on Earth is 3430 N, the mass is 3430 / g_earth.

Wait, but without knowing g_earth, I can't proceed. So perhaps I need to compute the acceleration on Mars first.

Wait, but I think I did the calculation correctly. So perhaps the correct answer is 3.71 m/s², which is option G.

Wait, but looking back, the options may have I:4.9 or J:5.9. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the units are different. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, another way: Let's compute g_mars using the formula.

g_mars = (G * M_mars) / r_mars^2.

G is 6.674e-11.

M_mars =6.42e23 kg.

r_mars=3.40e6 m.

So, compute numerator: 6.674e-11 *6.42e23.

6.674e-11 *6.42e23 = (6.674 *6.42) * 1e( -11 +23 )=42.847e12 =4.2847e13.

Denominator: (3.40e6)^2 = (3.4e6)^2 =11.56e12 =1.156e13.

So, 4.2847e13 / 1.156e13 = (4.2847 /1.156 ) = approx 3.706.

So, 3.706 m/s², which rounds to 3.7 m/s². So option G is 3.7, so the correct answer is G.

To determine the acceleration due to gravity on Mars, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration:

\[
g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (gravitational constant),
- \( M = 6.42 \times 10^{23} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of Mars),
- \( r = 3.40 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \) (radius of Mars).

### Step 1: Compute \( r^2 \)
\[
r^2 = (3.40 \times 10^6)^2 = 1.156 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( G \cdot M \)
\[
G \cdot M = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (6.42 \times 10^{23}) = 4.2847 \times 10^{13} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( g \)
\[
g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2} = \frac{4.2847 \times 10^{13}}{1.156 \times 10^{13}} = 3.706 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the options
The computed value of \( g \) is approximately \( 3.706 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which rounds to \( 3.7 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Among the given options, the closest match is **3.7**.
