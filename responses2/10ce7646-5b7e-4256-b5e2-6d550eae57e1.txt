Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about tools for assessing suicide risk. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is asking which of the options is NOT an available tool for assessing suicide risk. The options are A through J.

First, I need to understand what each tool is generally used for. I remember that tools are questionnaires or question banks used in research or practice to measure specific mental health constructs.

Looking at the options:

A: Suicide Risk Identification Tool – This sounds like a tool meant to identify potential suicide risks among individuals. I think these are often used in clinical settings to help identify at-risk individuals.

B: Suicide Risk Assessment Manual – This is a manual that probably provides guidelines or procedures for assessing suicide risk. It might include questionnaires or criteria, so it's definitely a tool for assessing risk.

C: Mood Disorder Questionnaire – Mood disorders are a broad category, like depression, anxiety, etc. A mood disorder questionnaire could be used to assess someone's mood, which is a component of mental health. So this is likely a tool for assessing mental health, including aspects related to suicide risk.

D: Beck Hopelessness Scale – This scale measures hopelessness, a component of hopelessness disorder, which is a type of depression. Hopelessness is linked to suicide risk, so this tool is used to assess someone's hopelessness, hence contributing to suicide risk assessment.

E: Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation – The Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSHI) is a self-reporting tool used to assess the level of suicidal ideation someone has. If someone is ideating suicide, this tool would help identify that. It's used in research and treatment planning.

F: The Suicide Action Questionnaire – This tool is used to assess suicidal ideation and behavior. It's a self-reporting questionnaire that includes items to identify suicidal thoughts and actions.

G: Oxford Happiness Questionnaire – This is a measure of overall happiness and life satisfaction. While happiness is a positive trait, it's not directly related to suicide risk. It's more about overall well-being, not directly assessing mental health issues.

H: Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire – Similar to option E, this is a self-reporting tool to assess suicidal ideation. It's used in research and treatment to understand the extent of suicidal thoughts.

I: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales – These are measures of anxiety and stress related to depression. They assess the impact of depression on the individual's mental health, so they contribute to overall mental health assessment, including aspects of suicide risk.

J: Mental Health Inventory – This is a general mental health inventory that includes various questionnaires. It's used in research and clinical settings to assess multiple aspects of mental health, including mental disorders that may contribute to suicide risk.

Now, the question is which one is NOT available. From the above, all options except G are likely available tools. G is the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire, which is about overall happiness and not directly assessing mental health disorders or suicide risk factors. So the answer should be G.

The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (G) is not an available tool for assessing suicide risk. It measures overall happiness and life satisfaction, which are unrelated to mental health issues. The other options (A through J) are all tools used in mental health research and treatment planning.

**Answer: G**
