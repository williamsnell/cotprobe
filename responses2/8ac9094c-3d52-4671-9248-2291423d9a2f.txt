Question:

An owner entered into a written contract with a landscaper whereby the landscaper promised to landscape the exterior of the owner's house for the sum of $5,000. According to their agreement, the owner was to pay the money to the landscaper's son. The landscaper intended to have the $5,000 given to his son as a graduation present. After the landscaper completed the job, the landscaper requested that the owner pay the $5,000 to him instead of to his son. The owner paid the landscaper. The next day, the son learned of the contract between the landscaper and the owner, as well as the payment to his father. In an action by the son against the owner for $5,000, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the written contract between the owner and the landscaper operated as a valid assignment to the son.
B: prevail, because the son was the intended beneficiary under the terms of the written contract between the owner and the landscaper.
C: not prevail, because the son did not give any consideration.
D: prevail, because the owner had a duty to honor the original agreement.
E: not prevail, because the landscaper, as the original contractor, had the right to alter the terms of payment.
F: not prevail, because the son was not a party to the original contract.
G: not prevail, because the son was not directly involved in the contractual agreement.
H: prevail, because the owner breached the contract by not paying the son.
I: prevail, because the son was a third party beneficiary of the contract.
J: not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it carefully.

The owner entered into a written contract with a landscaper. The contract says the owner would pay $5,000 to the landscaper's son. The son intended it as a graduation gift. When the landscaper finished, he asked the owner to pay $5,000 to himself instead. The owner paid, and now the son is suing the owner for $5,000. The question is whether the son will prevail.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, the contract is written and signed. That's a key point. In contract law, a written contract is a binding contract unless it's voidable. So I don't think the contract is voidable here.

The owner is obligated to pay the son $5,000. But the son intended it as a graduation present. So, under contract law, the contract should protect the son. But there's a twist here because the owner didn't just pay the amount; the son realized the contract and the payment.

Wait, the owner paid the $5,000 to the son. But the owner is suing, so they think they owe the son another $5,000. But wait, the contract says the son gets it. So why would the owner pay again? Maybe the owner thought they owed the son another amount, but the contract didn't specify that.

Wait, the contract is a written agreement where the owner promises to pay the son $5,000. So the son is an implied beneficiary. The contract is valid because the terms are clear. So the owner is obligated to pay the son the $5,000.

But the owner didn't pay it because he thought he had a duty to honor the contract. Wait, no, the contract says the owner must pay, so if the son is a beneficiary, the owner is supposed to pay. So why is the owner paying again? Oh, wait, maybe the owner didn't realize the contract was there. So when the owner paid, he thought he was owed more because the son was the beneficiary.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The contract is written, so it's enforceable. The owner agreed to pay the son $5k. So the son should get that. But the owner didn't pay the son the $5k, but the son discovered the contract and the payment. Wait, no, the owner did pay the $5k, which was the contract.

Wait, but the owner is suing for another $5k. So why does the owner owe the son another $5k? Because the contract says the owner must pay, so the owner is supposed to pay. So the owner's action of paying $5k again is perhaps a breach. But the question is, what's the outcome.

Wait, but the son is suing for $5k. So if the contract says the owner must pay $5k, the son is claiming he should have received that. So perhaps the owner breached by not fulfilling the obligation. But wait, the contract is written, so the owner is bound. So why would the owner pay again?

Wait, perhaps the owner didn't realize the contract was there. So when he paid, he thought he was owed more, but the contract says he's only supposed to pay. So maybe the owner breached because he didn't pay, thinking he owed more, but the contract says he's only supposed to pay.

So, in the contract, the payment is for a graduation present. The owner gave the son the $5k, so the son is a beneficiary. The owner is supposed to honor the contract, so why did he pay again? That would mean he breached, so the son can sue.

But wait, the options say that the son is suing for $5k. So if the son is suing, he's thinking he's owed an additional $5k because he didn't pay. But in reality, the contract says he's only supposed to pay. So the owner breached, because he didn't pay the required amount under the contract. But wait, the contract says he must pay the $5k. So perhaps the owner should have paid, but he didn't. So the owner is in breach.

Wait, but the contract's terms are the owner must pay the son $5k. So if the owner didn't pay, he breached, so the son can sue. But the contract didn't say anything about the owner being allowed to collect more. So the owner's payment is exactly what's stipulated in the contract, so the son isn't entitled to anything beyond his assignment to the son.

Wait, but when the owner paid, he thought he was owed more because it was a graduation gift. So perhaps the owner didn't realize the contract was there, didn't expect it, and thus, the son is suing for the extra amount.

Alternatively, maybe the owner was supposed to honor the contract, so the owner shouldn't have paid again. So the owner was at odds with the contract, hence breached.

Wait, the question is about whether the son will prevail. So the options are about the outcome.

Option D says the son is a party to the contract, so he's protected. Option E says the contract was invalid, but that's not the case because the contract was written. So E is incorrect.

Option I: the son is a third party beneficiary, so the owner should have honored the contract. But the owner didn't honor it. So that's incorrect.

Option H says the owner breached. That would mean the son is in trouble, so the son will prevail.

Wait, but the contract is written, so the owner must pay. So the owner didn't pay, so he breached, which makes the son's claim valid. So the son will prevail.

Wait, but the son is suing for $5k. So the owner is not fulfilling his obligation, so the son is correct. Thus, the owner breached, the son wins.

So looking at the options, option H says the owner breached, so the son wins. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check. The contract was written; the owner must pay. The owner didn't pay, so he breached. So the owner is in breach, so the son's claim is valid, and the owner loses.

Wait, but the son is a beneficiary. So the contract is valid, the owner is owed, but he didn't pay. So the owner breached. So the son has a valid claim. So the answer is H: prevail, owner breached.

Wait, but wait, another angle: if the owner didn't pay, that's a breach of contract. So the son's suit is for breach, so the owner loses. So the son wins.

So the correct answer is H.

The owner entered into a written contract with the landscaper, promising to pay $5,000 to the son's father as a graduation present. The contract is enforceable as a written agreement. However, upon discovering the contract, the owner realized it and paid the $5,000 to the son. The son, as the intended beneficiary, is suing for another $5,000. The question is whether the son will prevail under the contract.

The key points are:

1. **Contract Validity**: The written contract is enforceable as it is legally binding unless it is voidable. There is no indication of such a possibility.

2. **Contract Obligation**: The owner is obligated to pay the $5,000 to the son as per the contract. The son is a beneficiary.

3. ** owner's Breach**: The owner did not honor the contract by paying the amount. The son realized the contract and the payment, indicating he was aware of the obligation.

4. **Breach of Contract**: The owner breached the contract by not fulfilling its obligations. The son's claim is valid, and the owner loses.

5. **Third Party Beneficiary**: The son was directly involved in the contract and the payment, making him a direct beneficiary.

Given these points, the owner breached the contract by not paying the required amount, and the son's claim is valid. Therefore, the owner loses, and the son prevails.

**Answer: H**
