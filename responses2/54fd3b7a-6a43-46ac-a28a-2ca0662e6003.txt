Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem states that 2.0 moles of CO₂ are in a fixed volume of 15.0 dm³ at 300 K. When they're supplied with 2.35 kJ of heat, the temperature rises to 341 K. I'm supposed to calculate the work done, w. They mentioned that CO₂ follows the van der Waals equation of state, so I'll have to use that.

Hmm, I remember that for work done during a process, especially when the system is changing volume, the work is calculated as w = -P_ext * ΔV. But wait, in this case, the system isn't necessarily expanding or contracting isothermally or anything like that. It's a process where heat is added, causing a temperature increase.

Wait, but wait, the van der Waals equation is a real gas equation, so we can't assume ideal gas behavior. But the problem says to assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Oh, wait, no, the note says that unless otherwise stated, they assume perfect gases. So maybe they mean the equation of state is used, but perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be based on the van der Waals equation's work calculation.

Wait, but wait, the question is about calculating w, which I think is work done on the system. Or is it work done by the system? Because work done on the system is negative.

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think. The first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as ΔU = q - w, where w is the work done by the system.

So in this case, the system absorbs heat, so q is positive. The question is about w, which is work done on the system. But wait, the process is heating the gas, so the system is absorbing heat. So q is positive, meaning the system is doing positive work on the surroundings. Therefore, the surroundings are doing negative work on the system. But I'm not sure if that's the way to think about it.

But wait, the van der Waals equation is used here. The van der Waals equation is PV = nRT - n²a/V², but no, wait, no—wait, the correct van der Waals equation is (P + (n²a/V²))(V - nb) = nRT. So this is the correct equation.

But I'm not sure how to directly compute work from the van der Waals equation, unless maybe I can compute the change in internal energy using the van der Waals equation and then relate it to heat.

Wait, another approach: the first law says ΔU = q + w, where w is work done on the system. So rearranging, w = ΔU - q.

But I don't know ΔU directly. Oh, but perhaps I can compute ΔU using the van der Waals equation. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the work done using integration, but that might be tricky.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of enthalpy change or something else. Or perhaps the problem is considering the system's internal energy change and relating it to the heat added, which would involve the van der Waals equation.

Wait, but wait: in the van der Waals equation, the work done during a process can be calculated using the integral of P dV. So for a general process, work is the integral from initial to final volume of P dV. But since the van der Waals equation is used, we can express P in terms of V.

So the van der Waals equation is PV = nRT - n²a/V². So P = [nRT - n²a/V²]/V = nRT/V - n²a/V³.

So the work done would be the integral from V_initial to V_final of P dV.

So let's write it out.

Initial volume V1 is 15.0 dm³, which is 0.015 m³ (since 1 dm³ is 1e-3 m³, so 15 dm³ is 0.015 m³).

Final volume V2 is the same as V1, because it says the volume is fixed. Oh wait, the problem states that the volume is fixed, so V1 = V2.

Wait, that's a key point. The volume is fixed, so the change in volume is zero. So the integral from V1 to V2 of P dV would be zero. Because V1 = V2. So the work done is zero?

But wait, that can't be right because then the work is zero, so the change in internal energy would be equal to the heat added, q. But the problem states that q is positive, so that would make ΔU = q + w. If w is zero, ΔU = q. So ΔU would be positive, but that would mean the internal energy increases, which can't happen if the volume is fixed. Because in a fixed volume process, the internal energy change can't happen if the volume doesn't change. Unless the process is at constant volume, which would mean no work done, but that's only if it's isochoric.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the process is "supplied with 2.35 kJ of energy as heat", which implies that the system is being heated. But that's a bit confusing because if the volume is fixed, the system can't expand or contract, so internal energy can't change. So how can there be heat added?

This seems conflicting. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the process isn't isochoric. Oh wait, the question says the volume is fixed, so it's isochoric. So in an isochoric process, heat is added at constant volume, and the work done is zero because W = P_ext * ΔV, and ΔV is zero. So the first law would give ΔU = q + w. But since W is zero (because ΔV is zero), then ΔU = q. But wait, in an isochoric process, the change in internal energy is zero because ΔU = nCvΔT. Wait, no, in an isochoric process, the change in internal energy is zero only if it's an ideal gas. For a real gas, it's different.

But wait, for an isochoric process, the change in internal energy is ΔU = n Cv ΔT. But if the process is isochoric and the temperature increases, then ΔU is positive. But in our case, q is positive (heat added), so if ΔU = q, then that would imply Cv is positive. But wait, Cv is positive for most gases, including CO₂. So that makes sense.

Wait, but the problem says that the gas is described by van der Waals equation, which is real. So how can the internal energy change? Because if the process is isochoric and the temperature changes, the internal energy should change. So in this case, perhaps the work done is not zero, because the process is not isochoric. Wait no, wait, the problem does state that the volume is fixed, so the process must be isochoric. So the change in internal energy is due to heat and work. But wait, if the volume doesn't change, then work done is zero. But then, the first law would imply ΔU = q. But in reality, the internal energy of a gas depends on temperature and volume, so in an isochoric process, the internal energy change is (n)(Cv)ΔT. So that's non-zero.

Wait, but in an isochoric process, the work done is zero, so the heat added is equal to the change in internal energy. So q = ΔU. So if q is positive, then ΔU is positive. But in reality, for a real gas, the internal energy change depends on more factors than just temperature. But perhaps in this problem, we are to treat it as an ideal gas because the van der Waals equation is given. Because van der Waals is an approximation, but the problem states to assume gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. So perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be based on the ideal gas equation. So maybe the work is zero.

Wait, but let's think again. The problem says all gases are perfect except when stated. So they're using the van der Waals equation, which is not ideal, but perhaps in the van der Waals equation, they're assuming the system is ideal. Or maybe the problem is just using the van der Waals equation to solve for internal energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the data given. 2.0 mol of CO₂ at 300 K, in a volume of 15 dm³, when heat is added, the temperature increases to 341 K. So the system undergoes a change in temperature, implying that the internal energy changes.

But the process is supplied with heat, so q is positive. So the system absorbs heat. The work done is zero because the volume is fixed. So according to the first law, ΔU = q + w. But if w is zero, then ΔU = q. But for a real gas, is that possible? Because internal energy depends on temperature and volume. So if the gas is real, then in an isochoric process, internal energy change would be (n)(Cv)ΔT, which is positive. But the van der Waals equation is used here, but perhaps the problem is simplified, treating it as an ideal gas.

Wait, but the question says to assume CO₂ is described by van der Waals equation. So I think the approach here is to calculate the work done via the van der Waals equation, not relying on ideal gas assumptions, but perhaps the initial approach.

Wait, but if the volume is fixed, then the work done is zero. So the system's internal energy change is equal to the heat added. So w would be zero. But that can't be because the problem is giving a positive heat. So perhaps the process is not isochoric, but the problem states the volume is fixed. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the process isn't isochoric. The problem says that the volume is fixed at 15 dm³. So it's an isochoric process. So the work done is zero. So the first law gives ΔU = q. So the change in internal energy is positive (since the temperature increases from 300 to 341 K). So the internal energy increases by 2.35 kJ? Wait, but wait, the problem says the heat is supplied as 2.35 kJ, so if the process is isochoric, then ΔU is positive because temperature increases. So q = 2.35 kJ, and w is zero. So the answer would be zero work done. So option C.

But wait, that's not right because in the van der Waals equation, the internal energy is a function of pressure and volume, not just temperature. Also, CO₂ is a real gas, so its internal energy change isn't just n Cv ΔT. But wait, if the process is isochoric, then the work done is zero, so the heat added would equal the change in internal energy. So if the internal energy increases, then q is positive and w is zero. So the work done on the system is zero.

But the question is phrased as "calculate w". So if work is zero, the answer would be option C (0). But looking back at the options, option C is 0, so that's an option.

Wait, but wait, perhaps in the problem, it's not an isochoric process. Oh, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read again.

The problem states that the volume is fixed. So the volume doesn't change. Therefore, the work done is zero because W = P_ext * ΔV, and ΔV is zero. So w = 0. So the answer would be C.

But wait, but the problem also says the system is supplied with heat as 2.35 kJ. So q is positive, and since work is zero, ΔU = q. The change in internal energy is 2.35 kJ, which is positive. But for a real gas, the internal energy change isn't just n Cv ΔT. So perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into assuming ideal gas behavior, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the van der Waals equation is used to compute the work done. But since the volume is fixed, the integral of P dV from V1 to V2 would be zero, so work is zero. So the work done is zero, so the answer is C.

But wait, the options include positive and negative values. So perhaps the problem is considering that the system is doing work on the surroundings, which would be negative.

Wait, perhaps the process is not isochoric. Let me think again. The problem says the volume is fixed, so it's an isochoric process. Work done is zero, so w is zero.

So the answer should be option C: 0 kJ.

But wait, another thought. The problem mentions that the van der Waals equation is used, and perhaps I'm to calculate the work done on the system, so w would be negative because the system is doing work. But when the volume is fixed, the work is zero. So the correct work is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not isochoric. Maybe the volume isn't fixed, but the problem states it is. So the volume is fixed, so W is zero. So the work done is zero.

So the correct answer is option C: 0.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the work done, \( w \), for a sample of \( \text{CO}_2 \) under fixed volume conditions. The van der Waals equation is used to describe the gas, but the key point is that the volume is fixed, meaning \( \Delta V = 0 \). For an isochoric process, the work done is given by:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

Since \( \Delta V = 0 \), the work done is:

\[
w = 0
\]

Thus, the work done on the system is zero. The first law of thermodynamics, \( \Delta U = q + w \), further supports this conclusion because \( w = 0 \), and \( q \) is positive (heat is added to the system). The problem does not provide any additional information that would suggest a non-zero work contribution, such as non-ideal behavior or variable pressure-volume relationships.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**C: 0 kJ**
