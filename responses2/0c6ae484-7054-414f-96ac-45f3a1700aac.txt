Okay, so I have this problem to solve: find the limit as n approaches infinity of (2n)!! divided by (2n+1)!!. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on double factorials, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that for double factorials, (2n)!! is the product of all even numbers up to 2n. So that's 2 * 4 * 6 * ... * 2n. Similarly, (2n+1)!! would be the product of all odd numbers up to 2n+1, which is 1 * 3 * 5 * ... * (2n+1).

Now, the question is about the ratio of these two as n grows large. So, we're looking at the limit of [2n * (2n-2) * ... * 2] divided by [1 * 3 * 5 * ... * (2n+1)].

Wait, maybe I can express these products in terms of regular factorials. I recall that for even numbers, (2n)!! can be written as 2^n * n!. Because 2n * 2(n-1) * ... * 2 = 2^n (n!) ). Similarly, (2n+1)!! is (2n+1)! divided by (2^n n!). Because (2n+1)! is (2n+1)(2n)...(1) = (2n+1)(2n)!! So (2n+1)!! = (2n+1)! / (2^n n! ). 

So substituting back into the original expression, the numerator is 2^n n! and the denominator's numerator is (2n+1)! divided by (2^n n! ), so the whole expression becomes [2^n n! ] / [ (2n+1)! / (2^n n! ) ].

Wait, let's compute that step by step. The original ratio is (2n)!! / (2n+1)!! = [2^n n! ] / [ (2n+1)! / (2^n n! ) ] = [ (2^n n! )^2 ] / (2n+1)!.

So the expression simplifies to (2^n n! )^2 divided by (2n+1)!.

Now, perhaps I can use Stirling's approximation for factorials. Stirling's formula says that n! is approximately sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n. So let's approximate each part.

First, (2n)! is approximately sqrt(4πn) ( (2n)/e )^{2n}.

Wait, but in the numerator, it's (2^n n! )^2. Let's compute that: (2^n n! )^2 = 4^n (n! )^2.

Using Stirling's approximation for (n! )^2: (sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n )^2 = 2πn (n^n / e^{2n} ).

The denominator is (2n+1)!, which using Stirling's is approximately sqrt(4πn+1) [ (2n+1)/e ]^{2n+1}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approximate the ratio. Let's see:

The numerator is 4^n (n! )^2 ≈ 4^n * (2πn) (n^n / e^{2n} ) ).

The denominator is (2n+1)! ≈ sqrt(4πn+1) * ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1}.

So the ratio becomes [4^n * 2πn (n^n / e^{2n}) ] / [ sqrt(4πn+1) * ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1} }.

Hmm, let's simplify each part:

4^n is equal to (2^2)^n = 2^{2n}.

So 4^n / ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n} = [2^{2n} ] / [ (2n+1)^{2n} / e^{2n} ) ] = (2^{2n} ) * e^{2n} / ( (2n+1)^{2n} )

= [ (2 e) / (2n+1) ]^{2n}.

Wait, because 2^{2n} is (2^2)^n = 4^n, e^{2n} is e^{2n}, and denominator (2n+1)^{2n} is (2n+1)^{2n}.

So, putting it together, the 4^n / ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n} = [ (2 e) / (2n+1) ]^{2n}.

Now, the entire ratio is [4^n (n! )^2] / (2n+1)! ≈ [ (2 e/(2n+1))^{2n} ) ] * [ 2πn ] / sqrt(4πn +1) ) * (e)^{-2n}.

Wait, wait. Let me recast it:

The numerator expression after Stirling is 4^n * 2πn * (n^n / e^{2n}).

The denominator is sqrt(4πn+1) * ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1}.

So our ratio is [4^n * 2πn * (n^n / e^{2n}) ] / [ sqrt(4πn +1) * ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1} }.

Let me break this down into terms:

= [4^n / e^{2n} ] * [2πn / sqrt(4πn +1) ] * [n^n / ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1} }.

Simplify each part:

4^n / e^{2n} = (4/e²)^n = ( (2)^2 / e^2 )^n = (2^2 / e²)^n.

(n^n / ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1} ) = n^n * e^{2n+1} / (2n+1)^{2n+1}.

Hmm, putting it all together:

= (2^2 / e²)^n * [2πn / sqrt(4πn +1)] * [n^n e^{2n+1} / (2n+1)^{2n+1} }.

Combine the exponents:

= [ (2^2 / e²) * e^{2n+1} ]^n * [2πn / sqrt(4πn +1)] * [ n^n / (2n+1)^{2n+1} }.

Wait, I'm not sure that's the right approach. Maybe I should group the (4^n)/( (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) and e^{2n} terms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to take the logarithm of the ratio and see if it approaches zero, a finite limit, or infinity.

Let me take the natural logarithm of the expression:

ln( R ) = ln( (2n)!! ) - ln( (2n+1)!! )

Using the expressions for double factorials:

= ln(2^n n! ) - ln( (2n+1)! / (2^n n! ) )

= ln(2^n n! ) - [ ln( (2n+1)! ) - ln(2^n n! ) ]

= 2 ln(2^n n! ) - ln( (2n+1)! )

= 2 (n ln 2 + ln n! ) - ( ln( (2n+1)! ) )

Now, using Stirling's formula for ln(n!):

ln(n!) ≈ n ln n - n + (1/2) ln(2πn).

So substituting:

= 2 [n ln 2 + n ln n - n + 0.5 ln(2πn) ] - [ (2n+1) ln(2n+1) - (2n+1) + 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1)) ) ]

Now, let's expand this:

= 2n ln 2 + 2n ln n - 2n + ln(2πn) - [ (2n+1) ln(2n+1) - (2n+1) + 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1)) ) ]

Now, let's expand the brackets:

= 2n ln 2 + 2n ln n - 2n + ln(2πn) - (2n+1) ln(2n+1) + (2n+1) - 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1))

Now, let's collect similar terms:

Terms with n ln n: 2n ln n.

Terms with ln n: 2n ln 2 + ln(2πn) - 0.5 ln(2π(2n)).

Wait, let me see. Alternatively, group all the n ln n terms, n ln terms, and constants.

Let me group:

n ln n terms: 2n ln n.

Other n ln terms: - (2n+1) ln(2n+1) + 2n ln 2.

Other constants: -2n + (2n+1) + ln(2πn) - 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1)).

Wait, let's break it down:

The term is:

2n ln2 + 2n ln n - 2n + ln(2πn) - (2n+1) ln(2n+1) + (2n+1) - 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1)).

So, we can write parts as:

-2n + (2n+1) = 1.

Then, the ln terms:

2n ln n + ln(2πn) - (2n+1) ln(2n+1) - 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1)).

And the constants: ln(2πn) - 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1)).

Let me factor out the n:

The n ln n term is 2n ln n.

The ln(2πn) terms: ln(2πn) - 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1)).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out n and 2n+1.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the dominant terms as n becomes large. Let's consider each group.

First, the n ln n term: 2n ln n.

The other n ln terms:

- (2n+1) ln(2n+1) + 2n ln 2.

We can factor (2n+1) as roughly 2n for large n. So we have approximately:

- 2n ln(2n) + 2n ln2.

Which is -2n [ ln2 + ln n ] + 2n ln2 = -2n ln2 - 2n ln n + 2n ln2 = -2n ln n.

Wait, that's interesting. So the n ln n terms and the other n ln terms cancel each other out, leaving us with:

The other terms: 1 (from the -2n + (2n+1) ) plus the ln terms.

But wait, let me compute each part precisely.

The terms:

2n ln n: from 2n ln n.

- (2n+1) ln(2n+1) + 2n ln 2: expand (2n+1) ln(2n+1) as 2n ln(2n+1) + ln(2n+1). So:

= -2n ln(2n+1) - ln(2n+1) + 2n ln 2.

Now, ln(2n+1) is ≈ ln(2n) for large n. So ln(2n+1) ≈ ln(2n) + ln(1 + 1/(2n)) ≈ ln(2n) + 1/(2n).

So, -2n ln(2n+1) ≈ -2n [ ln(2n) + 1/(2n) ] = -2n ln(2n) - 1.

Similarly, 2n ln2 is 2n ln2.

So putting it together:

= -2n ln(2n) -1 - ln(2n+1) + 2n ln2.

= [ -2n ln(2n) + 2n ln2 ] + [ -1 - ln(2n+1) ].

The first part: -2n (ln(2n) - ln2 ) = -2n ln( (2n)/2 ) ) = -2n ln n.

The second part: -1 - ln(2n+1) ≈ -1 - (ln(2n) + ln(1 + 1/(2n)) ) ≈ -1 - ln(2n) - 1/(2n).

So combining, the entire expression becomes:

2n ln n (from earlier) + ( -2n ln n ) + ( -1 - ln(2n) ) + ... ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to reorganize.

We have:

2n ln n (from the first term) 

plus 

-2n ln(2n+1) + 2n ln2 

plus 

- ln(2n+1).

Now, let's compute each part:

-2n ln(2n+1) = -2n [ ln(2n) + ln(1 + 1/(2n)) ] ≈ -2n ln(2n) - 2n * (1/(2n)) ) = -2n ln(2n) -1.

2n ln2 is 2n ln2.

So the sum is: (-2n ln(2n) -1) + 2n ln2 = (-2n ln(2n) + 2n ln2 ) -1 = 2n ( ln2 - ln(2n) ) -1.

Wait, ln(2n) is ln2 + ln n. So ln2 - ln(2n) = ln2 - (ln2 + ln n) ) = - ln n.

So the sum becomes: 2n (- ln n) -1 = -2n ln n -1.

Then, the remaining part: - ln(2n+1).

So combining all together, the entire ln R is:

2n ln n (from the first term) 

plus 

(-2n ln n -1 ) 

plus 

- ln(2n+1) 

plus the other terms.

Wait, the other terms after factoring the n ln n and n ln terms:

Plus 1 (from the -2n + (2n+1) part).

Plus the ln terms: which were [ ln(2πn) - 0.5 ln(2π(2n+1)) ) ] plus [ -1 - ln(2n+1) ].

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should approximate the entire expression.

Wait, perhaps using Stirling's formula isn't the best approach. Maybe I can use the ratio of the two double factorials.

Alternatively, think about the ratio as (2n)!! / (2n+1)!! = 1 / [(2n+1)/(2n) * (2n-1)/(2n-2) * ... * 3/2 * 1/1].

Wait, that's a product of terms each of which is (2k+1)/(2k) for k from n down to 1.

So each term is (2k+1)/(2k) = 1 + 1/(2k).

Hmm, but the product of these terms is [ (3/2)(5/4) ... (2n+1)/(2n) ) ].

So the entire ratio is 1 / [ (3/2)(5/4)...(2n+1)/(2n) ) ].

Alternatively, the product can be written as (1/2^n) * ( (2n+1)!! ) / (2n)!! ), but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express (2n+1)!! as (2n+1) * (2n-1) * ... * 3 * 1.

So the ratio becomes [2n * (2n-2) * ... * 2 ] / [ (2n+1) * (2n-1) * ... * 3 * 1 ] = [2^n n! ] / [ (2n+1)!! ].

Wait, but I'm going in circles.

Wait, another approach: (2n)!! = 2^n n! and (2n+1)!! = (2n+1)! / (2^n n! ), so the ratio is (2^n n! )^2 / (2n+1)!.

So (2^n n! )^2 / (2n+1)!.

We can approximate (2n+1)! using Stirling's formula: (2n+1)! ≈ sqrt(4πn+1) ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1}.

Similarly, (2^n n! )^2 ≈ (2^{2n} n^{2n} e^{-2n} ) ) from Stirling's approximation.

So putting it all together:

(2^{2n} n^{2n} e^{-2n} ) / sqrt(4πn +1) * e^{-2n} (2n+1)^{2n+1} / e^{2n+1}.

Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, perhaps take the ratio and take the logarithm.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare the growth rates. The numerator is (2n)!! and the denominator is (2n+1)!!.

Looking for the limit as n approaches infinity of (2n)!! / (2n+1)!!.

But (2n+1)!! = (2n+1)(2n-1)...3*1.

The numerator is (2n)(2n-2)...2.

So the ratio is (2n)(2n-2)...2 / [(2n+1)(2n-1)...3*1].

Each term in the numerator is 2k, where k from 1 to n.

Each term in the denominator is (2k+1), for k from 1 to n.

So the ratio is 1 / [ (2n+1)/(2n) * (2n-1)/(2n-2) * ... * 3/2 * 1/1 ].

Each fraction in the denominator is (2k+1)/(2k) = 1 + 1/(2k).

So the ratio is the product of (1 + 1/(2k)) from k=1 to n, but in reverse order: (1 + 1/(2n)) (1 + 1/(2(n-1))) ... (1 + 1/2) (1 + 1/1).

Wait, no, the denominator's product is (3/2)(5/4)...(2n+1)/(2n) )= ( (2n+1)(2n-1)...3 )/( (2n)(2n-2)...2 ) ).

So when you take the reciprocal, you get (2n)(2n-2)...2 / ( (2n+1)(2n-1)...3 ), which is exactly the ratio we're considering.

But each of the terms in the denominator's product is (2k+1)/(2k) = 1 + 1/(2k).

So the product of these terms is product_{k=1 to n} (1 + 1/(2k)).

We can approximate this product for large n.

Taking logs: sum_{k=1 to n} ln(1 + 1/(2k)).

Using the approximation ln(1 + x) ≈ x for small x.

So sum ≈ sum_{k=1 to n} [ 1/(2k) ] = 1/2 sum_{k=1 to n} 1/k ≈ 1/2 ln n.

Because the sum of 1/k from k=1 to n is approximately ln n + γ, where γ is Euler-Mascheroni constant.

So ln(Ratio) ≈ 1/2 ln n.

So R = exp( (1/2) ln n ) ) = n^{1/2} = sqrt(n).

Wait, but that can't be right because the numerator and denominator are both O(n^n), so their ratio is O(n^{n - n}) )= O(1), but according to this, it's O(sqrt(n)), which suggests that the ratio grows as sqrt(n), which would approach infinity as n approaches infinity. But wait, that contradicts our earlier thought that the limit might be zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me think again.

Wait, the product of (1 + 1/(2k)) from k=1 to n is equal to exp( sum ln(1 + 1/(2k)) ) ≈ exp( sum 1/(2k) ) because ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x.

So sum 1/(2k) from k=1 to n is (1/2)(H_n), where H_n is the nth harmonic number, approximately ln n + γ.

So the logarithm of the ratio R is (1/2)(ln n) + lower terms.

So R ≈ exp( (1/2) ln n ) ) = n^{1/2}.

Wait, that suggests that the ratio grows as sqrt(n), which would approach infinity as n approaches infinity. But that can't be right because the numerator and denominator are both O(n^n), so their ratio should approach a finite limit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the logarithm. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the product is (3/2)(5/4)...(2n+1)/(2n) ), which can be written as product_{k=1 to n} ( (2k+1)/(2k) ).

And (2k+1)/(2k) = 1 + 1/(2k).

So the product is product_{k=1 to n} (1 + 1/(2k)).

Taking the logarithm: ln(Ratio) = sum_{k=1 to n} ln(1 + 1/(2k)).

As 1/(2k) is small for large k, we can approximate ln(1 + 1/(2k)) ≈ 1/(2k).

So sum ≈ (1/2) sum_{k=1 to n} 1/k ≈ (1/2) ln n.

So ln(Ratio) ≈ (1/2) ln n.

Thus, Ratio = exp( (1/2) ln n ) ) = n^{1/2}.

So R = sqrt(n) = n^{1/2}.

Thus, as n approaches infinity, R approaches infinity. So the limit is infinity. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options are A: -1, B:0, C:E, D:1.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the limit is infinity, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the numerator and denominator. Let me check again.

The ratio is (2n)!! / (2n+1)!!.

Now, (2n+1)!! = (2n+1)(2n-1)...3*1.

(2n)!! = (2n)(2n-2)...2*1.

So the ratio is 1 / [ (2n+1)/(2n) * (2n-1)/(2n-2) * ... * 3/2 * 1/1 ].

So each term in the denominator's product is (2k+1)/(2k), which is 1 + 1/(2k).

So the product is product_{k=1 to n} (1 + 1/(2k)).

As n approaches infinity, the sum of 1/(2k) is approximately (1/2) ln n.

Thus, ln(Ratio) ≈ (1/2) ln n.

So Ratio ≈ e^{(1/2) ln n} } = n^{1/2}.

Thus, the ratio grows as sqrt(n), so the limit is infinity.

But that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in one of the steps.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is actually (2n)!! / (2n+1)!! = 1 / [ (2n+1)/(2n) * (2n-1)/(2n-2) * ... * 3/2 * 1/1 ].

But each term is (2k+1)/(2k) = 1 + 1/(2k). So the product is product_{k=1 to n} (1 + 1/(2k)).

So for large n, the sum of 1/(2k) is approximately (1/2)(ln n + γ).

So ln(Ratio) ≈ (1/2)(ln n), and Ratio ≈ n^{1/2}.

So the ratio increases without bound as n increases.

But the given options don't include infinity. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the terms. Let me double-check the original problem.

The problem is the limit as n approaches infinity of (2n)!! / (2n+1)!!.

Wait, but in our calculation, the ratio is (2n)!! / (2n+1)!! = 1 / [ (2n+1)/(2n) * (2n-1)/(2n-2) * ... * 3/2 * 1/1 ].

Which is the reciprocal of a product of terms each of which is slightly greater than 1. So the product is greater than 1, so the reciprocal is less than 1. So the ratio is less than 1, which makes sense.

But according to our previous calculation, the ratio is sqrt(n), which grows without bound. But that would suggest that the limit is infinity, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the logarithm.

Wait, perhaps the logarithm of the product is sum_{k=1 to n} ln(1 + 1/(2k)).

But for small x, ln(1 + x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + ... So for larger x, the approximation isn't as good.

Wait, but 1/(2k) is small for large k, so the approximation is valid.

So sum_{k=1 to n} ln(1 + 1/(2k)) ≈ sum_{k=1 to n} [ 1/(2k) - (1/(2k))^2 / 2 + ... ].

But since 1/(2k) is small, the first term is the dominant one.

So sum ≈ sum_{k=1 to n} 1/(2k) = (1/2)(H_n) ≈ (1/2) ln n.

Thus, ln(Ratio) ≈ (1/2) ln n, so Ratio ≈ e^{(1/2) ln n} = n^{1/2}.

So the ratio increases without bound as n increases.

But again, the options don't include infinity. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the growth rates of the numerator and denominator.

The numerator is (2n)!! = 2^n n!.

The denominator is (2n+1)!! = (2n+1)! / (2^n n! ).

So the ratio is (2^n n! )^2 / (2n+1)! ) = (4^n (n! )^2 ) / (2n+1)!.

Now, (2n)! ≈ sqrt(4πn) (2n/e)^{2n}.

Similarly, (2n+1)! ≈ sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1}.

So (n! )^2 ≈ (4πn) ( (2n/e)^{2n} ) ).

Putting this into the ratio:

4^n ( (4πn) ( (2n/e)^{2n} ) ) ) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1} ) ) ).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 4^n * 4πn * (2n/e)^{2n}.

Denominator: sqrt(4π(2n+1)) * (2n+1/e)^{2n+1}.

Let me break it down:

4^n * (2n/e)^{2n} = 4^n * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} }.

Similarly, (4πn) / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) = 4πn / [ 2 * sqrt(π(2n+1)) ) ] = (4πn) / (2 sqrt(π(2n+1)) )) ) = (2πn) / ( sqrt(π(2n+1)) ) ) = 2 sqrt(π n) sqrt(2n+1) ) / sqrt(π) ) )= 2 sqrt(n) sqrt(2n+1) ).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take the ratio step by step.

Let me write the ratio as:

4^n * (4πn) * ( (2n)^{2n} ) / e^{2n} ) ) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * ( (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) / e^{2n+1} ) ).

Simplify the expression:

4^n * 4πn * (2n)^{2n} / e^{2n} ) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * (2n+1)^{2n+1} / e^{2n+1} ) ).

We can factor out some terms:

= (4^n * 4πn * (2n)^{2n} ) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) * (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) ) * ( e^{2n} / e^{2n+1} ) )

= [ (4^n * 4πn * (2n)^{2n} ) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) * (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) ) ] * ( e^{-1} )

So the ratio becomes:

(4^n * 4πn * (2n)^{2n}) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) * (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) ) * e^{-1}.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about how the numerator and denominator compare as n increases.

The numerator is (2n)!! = 2^n n!.

The denominator is (2n+1)!! = (2n+1)! / (2^n n! ).

So the ratio is (2^n n! )^2 / (2n+1)! ) = (4^n (n! )^2 ) / (2n+1)!).

We can use Stirling's approximation for the factorials.

Stirling's formula is n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n.

So (n! )^2 ≈ (2πn) (n^{2n} e^{-2n} )).

(2n+1)! ≈ sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ( (2n+1)/e )^{2n+1}.

So the ratio becomes:

4^n (2πn) (n^{2n} e^{-2n} )) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ( (2n+1)^{2n+1} e^{-2n-1} ) ) ).

Simplify:

= (4^n * 2πn * n^{2n} e^{-2n} ) ) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ( (2n+1)^{2n+1} e^{-2n-1} ) ) )

= (4^n * 2πn * n^{2n} e^{-2n} ) ) * (1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * (1 / ( (2n+1)^{2n+1} e^{-2n-1} ) ) )

Simplify exponents:

e^{-2n} / e^{-2n-1} = e^{1}.

So:

= (4^n * 2πn * n^{2n} * 1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * (1 / ( (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) ) * e^{1}.

Simplify further:

4^n is (2^2)^n = 2^{2n}.

So:

= (2^{2n} * 2πn * n^{2n} ) / ( sqrt(4π) sqrt(2n+1) ) ) * (1 / ( (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) ) * e.

= (2^{2n} * 2πn * n^{2n} ) / ( 2 sqrt(π) sqrt(2n+1) ) ) * (1 / ( (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) ) * e.

Simplify constants:

2^{2n} * 2πn / ( 2 sqrt(π) sqrt(2n+1) ) ) = 2^{2n} * πn / ( sqrt(π) sqrt(2n+1) ) ) = 2^{2n} * sqrt(π) * πn / sqrt(2n+1).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost in simplifying this. Let me instead consider the ratio as:

After simplifying the exponents and constants, we have:

R ≈ (2^{2n} * 2πn * n^{2n}) / ( sqrt(4π(2n+1)) * (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) ) * e.

But perhaps I can write this as:

R ≈ (2^{2n} * 2πn * n^{2n}) / ( (2n+1)^{2n+1} ) ) * (1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * e.

Now, let's notice that 2n+1 = 2n (1 + 1/(2n)).

So (2n+1)^{2n+1} = (2n)^{2n+1} (1 + 1/(2n))^{2n+1}.

Similarly, n^{2n} is (n^2)^n.

But perhaps I can write the ratio as:

R ≈ (2^{2n} * 2πn * (n^2)^n ) / ( (2n)^{2n+1} (1 + 1/(2n))^{2n+1} ) ) * (1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * e.

Simplify:

= (2^{2n} * 2πn * (n^2)^n ) / ( 2^{2n+1} n^{2n+1} (1 + 1/(2n))^{2n+1} ) ) * (1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * e.

Wait, because (2n)^{2n+1} = 2^{2n+1} * n^{2n+1}.

So:

= (2^{2n} * 2πn * (n^2)^n ) / ( 2^{2n+1} n^{2n+1} (1 + 1/(2n))^{2n+1} ) ) * (1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * e.

Simplify exponents:

2^{2n} / 2^{2n+1} = 2^{-1} = 1/2.

Similarly, n^{2n} / n^{2n+1} = n^{-1} = 1/n.

So:

= (1/2) * (2πn) / n * (1/(1 + 1/(2n))^{2n+1}) ) * (1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * e.

Simplify:

(2πn)/n = 2π.

(1/2) * 2π = π.

So:

= π * (1/(1 + 1/(2n))^{2n+1}) ) * (1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ) * e.

Now, as n approaches infinity, 1/(2n) approaches zero.

So (1 + 1/(2n))^{2n+1} approaches e^{1} = e.

Similarly, (2n+1) is approximately 2n, so sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ≈ sqrt(8π n).

So 1 / sqrt(4π(2n+1)) ≈ 1 / sqrt(8π n).

Now, let's plug these approximations in:

= π * (1/e) * (1 / sqrt(8π n) ) * e.

Simplify:

= π * (1/e) * e / sqrt(8π n) ) = π * 1 / sqrt(8π n) ).

Now, this simplifies to:

= π / sqrt(8π n) ) = sqrt(π^2) / (sqrt(8π n) )) = sqrt(π) / (sqrt(8 sqrt(π)} )) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification.

Wait, π / sqrt(8π n) ) can be rewritten as sqrt(π^2) / sqrt(8π n) ), which is sqrt(π^2) / sqrt(8π n) = sqrt(π^2 / 8π n) ) = sqrt( π / (8n) ) ).

Which is sqrt( π ) / ( (2 sqrt(2)) sqrt(n) ) ).

But this seems to approach zero as n approaches infinity.

So the limit is zero.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the ratio grows without bound, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio R = (2n)!! / (2n+1)!! and see whether it approaches zero or infinity.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio R is equal to 1/( (2n+1)/(2n) * (2n-1)/(2n-2) * ... *3/2 ) ), which is the reciprocal of a product of terms each slightly larger than 1.

So each term is (2k+1)/(2k), which is 1 + 1/(2k). So the product is product_{k=1 to n} (1 + 1/(2k)).

Now, as n approaches infinity, the sum of 1/(2k) is approximately (1/2) ln n.

So the product is approximately exp( (1/2) ln n ) ) = n^{1/2}.

Thus, the reciprocal is 1/n^{1/2}, which approaches zero as n approaches infinity.

Therefore, the limit is zero.

So the correct answer is option B: 0.

The limit is zero. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Ratio:**
   The ratio in question is:
   \[
   R = \frac{(2n)!!}{(2n+1)!!}
   \]
   We need to evaluate the limit as \( n \to \infty \).

2. **Expressing Double Factorials:**
   For even \( n \):
   \[
   (2n)!! = 2^n \cdot n!
   \]
   For odd \( n \):
   \[
   (2n+1)!! = \frac{(2n+1)!}{(2^n \cdot n!)}
   \]
   So, the ratio becomes:
   \[
   R = \frac{(2^n \cdot n!)^2}{(2n+1)!}
   \]

3. **Using Stirling's Approximation:**
   Stirling's formula approximates factorials:
   \[
   n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n
   \]
   Applying this to \( (2n+1)! \):
   \[
   (2n+1)! \approx \sqrt{2\pi (2n+1)} \left( \frac{2n+1}{e} \right)^{2n+1}
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Ratio:**
   Substitute Stirling's approximation into the ratio:
   \[
   R \approx \frac{(2^n \cdot n!)^2}{(2n+1)!} \approx \frac{(2^n)^2 \cdot (n!)^2}{\sqrt{2\pi (2n+1)} \left( \frac{2n+1}{e} \right)^{2n+1}}
   \]
   Simplify the terms:
   \[
   = \frac{2^{2n} \cdot (n!)^2}{\sqrt{2\pi (2n+1)} \left( \frac{2n+1}{e} \right)^{2n+1}}
   \]
   Using \( n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \):
   \[
   (n!)^2 \approx (2\pi n) \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^{2n}
   \]
   Substitute back:
   \[
   R \approx \frac{2^{2n} \cdot 2\pi n \cdot \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^{2n}}{\sqrt{2\pi (2n+1)} \cdot \left( \frac{2n+1}{e} \right)^{2n+1}}
   \]
   Simplify the exponents and constants:
   \[
   = \frac{2^{2n} \cdot 2\pi n \cdot n^{2n}}{\sqrt{2\pi (2n+1)} \cdot (2n+1)^{2n+1} \cdot e^{2n+1}}
   \]
   Combine the terms:
   \[
   = \frac{2^{2n} \cdot 2\pi n \cdot n^{2n}}{(2n+1)^{2n+1}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi (2n+1)}} \cdot e^{-1}
   \]
   As \( n \to \infty \), \( (2n+1)^{2n+1} \approx 2^{2n+1} n^{2n+1} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{(2n+1)^{2n+1}} \approx \frac{1}{2^{2n+1} n^{2n+1}}
   \]
   Substitute back:
   \[
   R \approx \frac{2^{2n} \cdot 2\pi n \cdot n^{2n}}{(2^{2n+1} n^{2n+1})} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi (2n+1)}} \cdot e^{-1}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   = \frac{2\pi n}{2n} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi (2n+1)}} \cdot e^{-1} \approx \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi n}} \cdot e^{-1}
   \]
   As \( n \to \infty \), \( \sqrt{n} \) dominates, so:
   \[
   \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2\pi n}} \to 0
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The limit of \( R \) as \( n \to \infty \) is zero.
