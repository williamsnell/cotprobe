Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about the money supply when the Fed adds reserves and the public increases its currency holdings. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says the Federal Reserve adds $500,000 to the banking system's reserves. The required reserve ratio is 30%. Also, banks maintain no excess reserves, which probably means they're fully utilizing their reserves. And the public is increasing its holdings of currency by $200,000.

I remember that the money multiplier comes into play here. The money multiplier formula is 1/(required reserve ratio). So if the RRR is 30%, that's 0.3. So the money multiplier is 1/0.3, which is approximately 3.333... or 3.3333.

Wait, but I also have to consider the public's increased currency holdings. Oh wait, the public holding more currency. How does that affect the money supply? I think when the public holds more currency, it reduces the money supply because it doesn't get as much of it as it can be held as M1. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let's think: The money supply is made up of M1 and M2. M1 is currency in circulation plus checkable deposits. M2 is M1 plus other assets like traveler's checks and credit cards. But the question is about how adding reserves and the public's holding of currency affects the money supply.

Wait, the Fed adds $500,000 to reserves. The RRR is 30%, so for every dollar of reserves, the money supply can increase by 1/0.3, which is 3.333 times. So, the initial $500,000 added would multiply by 3.333 to give about $1,666,667. But wait, that's just the effect of the Fed's addition, not considering the public holding more cash.

Wait, but the public holding more currency. Let me think about that. When the public holds more currency, it's a part of M1. So if they hold more, that reduces the amount of money that can be created from the Fed's injection. Because when the Fed injects more reserves into banks, and banks do not hold any excess, the money multiplier comes into play. But if the public holds more currency, that might mean that the money multiplier isn't fully realized.

Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think again. The money multiplier depends on how much the public holds as currency. Because when the public holds more currency, it reduces the reserves that banks can lend out. Because the public holding more cash reduces the money supply because the money multiplier is based on the ability to create new money from reserves.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the impact of the Fed's addition on the money supply, and then see if the public's holding more currency affects that. But I'm a bit confused about the interaction between the Fed's reserve injection and the public's currency holdings.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Determine the effect of the Fed's $500,000 addition on the money supply. This is calculated using the money multiplier (1/RRR). So multiplier = 1/0.3 = 3.333. So $500,000 * 3.333 ≈ $1,666,667.

But wait, because the public's holding more currency, does that lower the money supply? Or does it affect the money multiplier?

Ah, I think when the public holds more of currency, it reduces the money supply. Because the public's holdings of currency make it a worse measure of the money supply. Wait, no—M1 is currency plus checkable deposits. So if the public holds more currency, the M1 increases, but the money supply (which is M1 plus other parts) might not increase as much because the Fed's reserves are being used to create more money. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the impact is calculated with the money multiplier, but the public's holding more currency reduces the money supply. Wait, no, the money multiplier is about how much the money supply can increase based on the reserves. If the Fed adds reserves, that's the starting point.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the initial effect of the Fed's addition and then see how the public's holding affects it. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of it as the Fed injecting reserves. The money multiplier is 3.333, so $500k would create $1.666M. But if the public holds more currency, that would imply that the money supply is already higher. Or wait, perhaps when the public holds more, it reduces the base for the multiplier.

Wait no, the money supply is M1 + M2. If the public holds more of the currency, that's part of M1. So when the Fed adds $500k to the reserves, that's the initial injection. But the public's holding more currency would mean that the money supply is already at a higher level, but the Fed's injection isn't fully effective because the public isn't holding as much money.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of an example. Suppose the Fed adds $100,000. The RRR is 30%, so the money multiplier would be 3.333. So the total money would increase by $333,333.

But if the public holds more currency, say, $200k, that would mean that the reserves are being held as currency, which is less than the required reserve. So the money multiplier effect isn't fully realized. Because when reserves are held as currency, they don't get multiplied.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that when the public holds more currency, it reduces the amount of money that can be created from the Fed's addition. So the money supply after the Fed's addition and the public's holding would be less than what it would otherwise.

Wait, no, perhaps the money supply is calculated as the Fed's addition multiplied by the money multiplier, but the public's holding more currency reduces the money supply. Because when the public holds more currency, it's a part of M1, which is already higher.

Wait, maybe the money supply is the initial Fed addition divided by the required reserve ratio, but adjusted for the public's holdings.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider two separate effects: the effect of the Fed's addition and the effect of the public's holdings.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "what is the effect on the money supply?"

Hmm. Let me look for another approach.

The money multiplier is 1/RRR. So, the money supply (M1) increases by (Reserves * multiplier).

Reserves increase by $500,000. So, the potential increase in M1 is 500k * 1/0.3.

Wait, that's 500k * 3.333... = around $1,666,667.

But wait, the public's holding more currency might influence this. How? Because when the public holds more currency, that's part of M1, but the money supply is M1 and M2, so perhaps the money supply is already higher. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the Fed's addition and the public's holding more don't interact in a way that affects the money multiplier. Because the money multiplier is just 3.333, so the Fed's $500k gets multiplied by that. So the money supply increases by $1,666,667.

But wait, the options don't have that. The options are in units of thousands, so perhaps I should calculate in thousands.

Wait, 500k * 3.333 is approximately 1,666,667. But looking at the options, the highest is A) $1,700,000, which is close. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute it properly.

500,000 * (1 / 0.3) = 500,000 * 3.333333333 ≈ 1,666,666.66. So approximately $1,666,667. But the options don't have that. The closest is option A: $1,700,000.

Wait, but then I should think about the impact of the public holding more currency. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of more currency in the public's holdings reduces the money supply. Because when people hold more currency, they don't need as much checking deposits, so the money multiplier is less effective.

Wait, no, I think the money multiplier is based on the ability to create money from reserves. The public's holding of currency may not directly affect the money multiplier but could affect the base money.

Wait, perhaps the money supply is calculated as the sum of the Fed's injection and the effect on M1. But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, another approach: When the Fed adds $500,000 to reserves, that's an increase in the money supply by 500,000 * 3.333... ≈ $1,666,667. But the public holding more currency might lower the money supply, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps when the public holds more currency, it reduces the money supply because it's less liquid. Or maybe it's the opposite. I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is just 500,000 multiplied by 3.333, which is around 1.666 million, but the options don't have that. The options are all in thousands, so perhaps the answer is approximately 1,700,000 (option A). But then I need to see if that's the case.

Wait, but wait, the public's holding more of currency. Let me think about the impact of the public holding more currency on the money supply. The public holding more currency would mean that the money supply is already higher, so the effect of the Fed's addition would be less. Because the Fed adds to the reserves, which would be used to create more money, but if the public holds more, the Fed's addition isn't as effective.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is to take the Fed's addition, then adjust for the public's holdings. Because when the public holds more, the money supply is already higher, so the effect of the Fed's addition is smaller.

Wait, but how? Let me think of the money multiplier as (1/RRR) multiplied by the reserves, but then the public's holdings affect that.

Wait, perhaps the money supply is the Fed's addition multiplied by the money multiplier, plus the effect from the public's holding more. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the money multiplier, then multiply by the Fed's addition, and then subtract any reduction due to the public's holding more currency.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me try another angle. The money multiplier is 3.333. So adding $500,000 to reserves would increase the money supply by 500,000 * 3.333 ≈ $1,666,667. But the options don't have that. The options are all in thousands, so perhaps the answer is approximately 1,700,000 (option A). But why would the public's holding more currency matter?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not option A. Because, when the public holds more currency, that actually makes the money supply lower. Wait, no, when the public holds more of the currency, that means M1 is higher because more people are holding it. So the money supply would be higher.

Wait, but the problem says the Fed adds to the reserves. So, if the Fed adds $500k, that's an injection into the banking system. Then, the money multiplier is 3.333, so the money supply increases by $500k * 3.333 ≈ $1,666,667. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct option is A: $1,700,000.

Wait, but given that the options are in thousands, maybe it's 1,700,000, which is option A.

But wait, I'm not sure because I might have missed something. The public holding more currency would mean that their holding is part of M1, so when the Fed adds $500,000, perhaps it's not fully utilized because the public holds more. So the money multiplier might be less effective.

Alternatively, perhaps the money supply is calculated as the Fed's addition divided by the RRR, but adjusted for the public's holdings. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should think of it as a two-step process. First, the money multiplier effect, and then adjust for the public's holdings.

Let me think again. The money multiplier is 3.333. So the initial money supply would increase by 500k * 3.333 ≈ 1,666,667.

But the public's holding more currency would imply that the money supply is higher because the public is holding more currency. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense. If the public holds more currency, that's part of M1, which is a component of the money supply. So why would the Fed's addition have a lesser effect?

Wait, perhaps the Fed's addition is already fully utilized because the public holds more currency. So the money supply doesn't increase as much as the Fed adds. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the money supply change as the Fed's addition multiplied by the money multiplier, and then see how the public's holding affects this.

Wait, but how? If the public holds more, that reduces the money supply. Let me think: if the public holds more of the currency, the money supply is already higher. So the Fed's addition doesn't have as much effect because the public's holdings are already holding it.

Wait, perhaps the money supply is calculated as the Fed's addition multiplied by the money multiplier, but the public's holding more would mean that the money supply is already at a higher level, so the additional addition doesn't contribute as much as it should.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find a formula. The money multiplier is (1 / RRR). So, the money supply increase is (M0 + reserves)/RRR. But M0 is the initial money supply. But in this case, the Fed adds to reserves. So, the new reserves are M0 + $500k. The money multiplier is 3.333, so the new money supply is (M0 + 500k) * 3.333. The change is 500k * 3.333 ≈ 1,666,667.

But the public's holding more currency might mean that the money supply is already higher, so perhaps the net effect is lower than that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔM = (Reserves_added) / RRR.

Because the money multiplier is 1/RRR. So, the change is $500,000 / 0.3 = $1,666,667. So the money supply increases by approximately $1.666 million.

But looking at the options, the closest is A) $1,700,000. So perhaps the answer is A. But why is the public holding more currency mentioned? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps the public's holding more currency is a red herring, or maybe it's part of the calculation. Let me think: the public's holdings of currency can affect the money supply because when the public holds more, it reduces the money supply. But that doesn't seem right. Wait, no—more currency held by the public would mean that the monetary base (M1) is larger, but the money supply (M1 + M2) is also larger. So perhaps the Fed's addition affects M1, which is part of the money supply. But then the public's holding more would mean that M1 isn't as much as it could be, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the money supply as the Fed's addition multiplied by the money multiplier, which is 3.333, so 500,000 * 3.333 ≈ 1,666,667, which is about 1.666 million. But the options don't have that. The closest is option A: $1,700,000.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the money multiplier, then multiply by the Fed's addition, and then adjust for the public's holding more. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The money multiplier is 3.333. So the money supply increases by 500,000 * 3.333 ≈ $1,666,667. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is A) $1,700,000.

But why the public's holding more? Maybe because the Fed's addition is already fully utilized because the public is holding more. So the increase is less than expected.

Wait, perhaps the Fed's addition is fully utilized, so the money supply is exactly that. But the problem says the Fed adds $500,000, and the public's holding more. So the money supply would increase by 500,000 * 3.333, which is approximately 1,666,667, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but why?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 500,000 / 0.3, which is 1,666,667. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the money multiplier is 3, so 500,000 *3 = 1,500,000. But that's not an option either.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the options again. The options given are in thousands, so perhaps I should look for an option that's 1.666 million, but none of them have that. So perhaps the correct approach is to think that the money multiplier is 3, and the Fed's addition is 500,000, so 500,000 *3 = 1,500,000, which is not an option. Alternatively, 500,000 * 0.333 = 166,500, which would be $166,500, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the money multiplier is 3, so 500,000 *3 = 1,500,000, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is A) $1,700,000.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is $1,500,000, but that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is A) $1,700,000.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me think of an example. Suppose the Fed adds $1,000,000, and the RRR is 30%. So the money supply increases by 1,000,000 * 3.333 ≈ $3,333,333. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the money multiplier is 3, so the money supply increases by 500,000 *3 = 1,500,000. But again, no option matches that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the money multiplier calculation. Let me recalculate: 1 / 0.3 is 3.333. So, 500,000 * 3.333 ≈ 1,666,666.66.

But the options are:

A) 1,700,000

B) 500,000

C) 3,000,000

D) 900,000

E) 2,000,000

So, none of these options match my calculation. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the Fed's addition is 500,000, and the public's holding more is 200,000. Wait, no, the problem states that the public holds 200,000.

Wait, perhaps the Fed's addition is 500,000, and the public's holding is 200,000. But the problem says the public holds 200,000.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the money multiplier calculation. Let me recalculate:

1 / 0.3 = 3.333333333.

So, 500,000 * 3.333333333 = 1,666,666.666.

Approximately $1,666,667. But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is A) $1,700,000, but that would be an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it as (500,000 / 0.3) = 1,666,667, which is approximately $1,666,667, which is close to $1,700,000. So, perhaps option A is the correct answer.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll have to go with option A) $1,700,000.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the effect of the Federal Reserve (Fed) adding $500,000 to the banking system and the public holding $200,000 of currency. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Money Multiplier Calculation**: The money multiplier is the reciprocal of the required reserve ratio (RRR). Here, the RRR is 30% (0.3). Thus, the money multiplier is \( 1 / 0.3 = 3.333 \).

2. **Effect of the Fed's Addition**: The Fed adds $500,000 to the reserves. The money supply increase is calculated by multiplying this amount by the money multiplier. Therefore, the increase in the money supply is \( 500,000 \times 3.333 = 1,666,500 \).

3. **Adjustment for Public's Holding**: The public holds $200,000 of currency, which is part of the monetary base (M1). Since the money multiplier is based on the ability to create money from reserves, the Fed's addition is fully utilized. Thus, the effect of the Fed's addition is not reduced by the public's holding.

4. **Approximation**: The calculated increase in the money supply is approximately $1,666,500. Among the provided options, the closest match is **A) $1,700,000**.

ANSWER: A
