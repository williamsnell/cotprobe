Alright, so I've got this question about ideal gases and their properties. Let me try to think it through. The question is asking under what conditions a pure sample of an ideal gas will have a pressure of 1 atm and a concentration of 1 mole per liter. Hmm, okay.

I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, concentration here is given as 1 mole per liter, which is molarity (M). So, concentration c = n/V = 1 M. So, V would be in liters, and n is moles.

Wait, pressure is 1 atm. So, let's plug in the values. 

The ideal gas law: P = (n/V) * R * T. Since n/V is 1 M (which is 1 mol/L), and P is 1 atm, we can set up the equation. So, 1 atm = (1 mol/L) * R * T.

Wait, but R is the gas constant. Oh, but R has different units depending on what you're using. Oh right, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when you're using pressure in atm, volume in liters, etc.

Wait, but wait, if I'm using standard conditions, like 25°C (298 K), then R would be 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Plugging in, 1 atm = (1 mol/L) * 0.0821 * T. So, solving for T: T = (1) / (0.0821) ≈ 12.2 K? Wait, that's about 255 degrees Celsius. Wait, 12.2 K is like 255 degrees Celsius. Is that correct?

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of standard conditions. At STP, the conditions are 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm, with a concentration of 1 M (since 1 mole per liter is 1 M). So, if the question is about STP, then the answer would be option C, 273.15 K.

Wait, but the question says "a pure sample of an ideal gas." The ideal gas law applies, but only at certain conditions. So, the 1 M concentration and 1 atm pressure would correspond to STP. So, the temperature would be 273.15 K.

So, looking at the options, option C is 273.15K, which is exactly that. So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine under what conditions a pure sample of an ideal gas will have a pressure of 1 atm and a concentration of 1 mole per liter (M), we use the ideal gas law: 

\[
PV = nRT
\]

Given that the concentration \( c = \frac{n}{V} = 1 \, \text{mol/L} \) and the pressure \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \), we can simplify the equation to:

\[
P = c \cdot RT
\]

Substituting the values, \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \), \( c = 1 \, \text{mol/L} \), and \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), we solve for temperature \( T \):

\[
1 = 1 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot T \implies T = \frac{1}{0.0821} \approx 12.2 \, \text{K}
\]

This temperature corresponds to 255°C, which is not one of the provided options. The question asks for conditions where the gas is at STP (standard temperature and pressure), which are \( 0^\circ \text{C} \) (273.15 K) and 1 atm. At these conditions, the concentration is 1 M, and the pressure is 1 atm. Therefore, the correct answer is when the temperature is 273.15 K.
