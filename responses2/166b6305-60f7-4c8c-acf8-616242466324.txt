Alright, so I've got this probability question in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and tackle it step by step. Okay, the problem states: Given probabilities P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.2, what is the probability of the union P(A ∪ B) under three different scenarios? The scenarios are when A and B are mutually exclusive, independent, and when B is a subset of A. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the formula for the probability of the union of two events is P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). So that's the key formula I'll need here.

First, let's go through each scenario.

1. **Mutually Exclusive Events**: These are events that cannot occur at the same time. So, if A and B are mutually exclusive, their intersection is empty, meaning P(A ∩ B) = 0. Plugging into the formula: P(A ∪ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0 = 0.5. So that's 0.5 for the first scenario.

2. **Independent Events**: Independent events are those where the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. The formula for independent events is also P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). So, calculating that: 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06. So, the union probability is 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.06 = 0.44. That's 0.44 for the second scenario.

3. **B is a Subset of A**: If B is entirely contained within A, then every outcome in B is also in A. That means P(A ∩ B) = P(B), which is 0.2. So, the union probability is P(A) + P(B) - P(B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.2 = 0.3. So, that's 0.3 for the third scenario.

Now, I need to match these results to the provided options. The options are labeled A through J, and each option lists three probabilities in order: first scenario, second, third.

Let me list the results again:

- Mutually Exclusive: 0.5
- Independent: 0.44
- Subset: 0.3

Looking at the options:

Option G says 0.5, 0.5, 0.3. Wait, no, because the third part is 0.3, but the second part (independent) is 0.44, not 0.5. So G can't be right.

Option D: 0.5, 0.44, 0.3. So that's 0.5, 0.44, 0.3. That matches exactly what I calculated. So option D would be correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me look for other options. Option E is 0.5, 0.44, 0.2. Third number is 0.2, which doesn't match my calculation. Option F says 0.6, 0.44, 0.3. No, first is 0.6, which isn't 0.5.

Option I has 0.44, 0.5, 0.2. That doesn't fit either. Option J is 0.44, 0.5, 0.2. That's the same as I, just different order. So no.

Option B says 0.5, 0.6, 0.3. No, second is 0.6 which I don't get.

Option C: 0.44, 0.5, 0.3. Hmm, third is 0.3, which matches, but the first is 0.44 (which is independent) and the second is 0.5 (which is mutual exclusive). But the order needs to be mutually exclusive first, then independent, then subset. So for that, the third scenario is 0.3, which would come third in the list. So in the options, the first scenario is mutual, the second is independent, third subset.

Looking again, option D is 0.5 (mutual), 0.44 (independent), 0.3 (subset). That's exactly what I got. So the answer should be D.

The correct option is D, as it correctly matches the probabilities for each scenario: 0.5 for mutual exclusivity, 0.44 for independence, and 0.3 for B being a subset of A.

Answer: D
