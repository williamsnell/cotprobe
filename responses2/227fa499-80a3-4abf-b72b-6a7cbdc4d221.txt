Okay, let's try to figure out the answer to Tisha's riddle. So the question is, what shape has 2 faces, no vertices, and can roll. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the shape has 2 faces. So that's like saying it's a polyhedron with two flat surfaces. What shapes have exactly two faces? Well, a prism comes to mind. A prism has two congruent polygonal bases and rectangular faces connecting them. But wait, prisms usually have more than two faces, unless it's a very simple one.

Wait, another possibility is a cylinder. A cylinder has two circular faces (the top and bottom) and no vertices. But can it roll? Oh, right, cylinders can roll because they have a curved surface that allows them to move. So a cylinder would fit the description: 2 faces, no vertices, and it can roll.

Looking at the options, cylinder is option I. Let me check the other options to make sure none fit better. Hexagonal prism has more than two faces, so that's not it. Torus is a donut shape, which has no vertices but can roll, but the question specifies 2 faces, which a torus doesn't have. Cone has a single circular face and a point, which is a vertex, so that doesn't fit. Prism has more than two faces, so that's not it. Sphere has a single curved face and no vertices, so that doesn't fit either because it needs two faces. Pyramid has a base and triangular faces, which would have a base face and other faces, but pyramids usually have more than two faces.

So the most accurate answer is cylinder, which is option I.

The riddle describes a shape with two faces, no vertices, and the ability to roll. A cylinder fits this description, as it has two circular faces and can roll. 

Answer: I. cylinder
