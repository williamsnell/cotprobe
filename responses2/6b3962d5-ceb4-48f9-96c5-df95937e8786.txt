Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about fuzzer styles and which one is more likely to explore all the lines of code. Let me think through this.

The question is asking which style of fuzzer explores every line of code. The options are A through J. I remember that fuzzer is a tool used for automated code coverage, right? So the styles refer to different approaches they take.

First, I need to recall what each style does. 

A: Syntax-based — this probably means it focuses on the structure and syntax of the code. It might check for structural errors or ensure that the code follows certain rules. I don't think it's exhaustive because it might miss some code, especially if there are exceptions or edge cases.

B: Mutation-based — this involves making changes to existing code and seeing how it behaves. It's more about testing by modifying and observing the outcomes. This could help catch issues that arise from changes but might not explore every line unless the mutations are extensive.

C: Greybox — I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think it's a style where the fuzzer runs a simulation of the code (like a model) to see how the code behaves without actually executing it. This might cover more code paths because it's based on simulation, but maybe not every line.

D: Evolutionary — this uses principles from natural evolution. It's a machine learning approach where it evolves and adapts based on results. I've heard that it's good for finding solutions through trial and error, but does it cover every line of code? I'm not sure. It's more about finding patterns or solutions without necessarily testing every line.

E: Coverage-based — this is straightforward. It's designed to check every line of code. It systematically goes through each line and verifies it. So this one seems like it's the right answer since it's explicitly about covering all lines.

F: Protocol-based — this is about testing for communication protocols. It might focus on how the code handles specific inputs or outputs. It's more about the interaction rather than the code itself.

G: Generational — I think this style involves generating code variations and running them. It's similar to mutation-based but might not cover every line as comprehensively as coverage-based.

H: Blackbox — this style doesn't look inside the code. It's more about the functionality and how the code responds to inputs. It might miss structural issues but focuses on functionality.

I: Random — it's a broad style, randomly testing code. It's not systematic and might miss some lines, especially if the code has patterns or dependencies.

J: Whitebox — this one is about simulating code without executing it. So it's similar to greybox but more controlled. It might not cover every line as thoroughly.

So putting it all together, the process of coverage-based (E) would systematically check every line of code, ensuring none are missed. That's probably what the question is asking for.

The style of fuzzer that systematically checks every line of code is **E: Coverage-based**.

Answer: E
