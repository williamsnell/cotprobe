Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a data set of students majoring in computer science in various colleges across the US. The question is asking which of the given options can be answered just by analyzing the data set, and each option is a yes or no question.

Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: What's the percentage of CS students who also participate in sports? Hmm, the data set only gives information about gender, state, and GPA. So, I don't have any data on which students are in sports. So A can't be answered.

Option B: How many states have a higher percentage of female CS majors. Oh wait, the data set has information about each student's state. So, for each state, I can calculate the percentage of female CS majors. Then, B can be answered by comparing these percentages across states.

Option C: Do CS students have higher GPAs than others. The data set tells me about GPAs, so yes, it can be answered. But wait, the question is in the form of a yes/no question. Wait, the options are presented as questions, so C is a yes/no question. Wait, the options are yes/no questions? Or are they phrased as what can be answered? The options are presented as yes/no questions, but looking at the options, wait: the question is about which can be answered by analyzing the data set. The options are the possible answers. So for each option, the question is whether it can be answered by the data.

Wait, the options are the possible answers, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking which of the following questions can be answered by analyzing the data set. So each option is a question, and the task is to choose which can be answered.

So, for option C: "Do CS students tend to have higher GPAs than students in other subjects?" The data set has each student's GPA, so yes, we can compare within CS students and across all CS students to other subjects. So C can be answered.

Option D: Average age of CS students. The data doesn't include age, only gender, state, and GPAs. So D can't be answered.

Option E: Most common second major. The data only lists gender, state, and GPAs. So E can't be answered.

Option F: Which college has the most CS students. The data gives state info, but not specific college names. So unless the data categorizes students by their college, which it doesn't, F can't be answered.

Option G: CS students' aid percentage. The data has GPAs, but not aid. So G can't be answered.

Option H: CS students in a state have higher aid. The data doesn't have info on aid. So H can't be answered.

Wait wait, I think I missed something. Let me recheck. The original data includes student's gender, state, and GPA. So which options can be answered?

Option B: For each state, calculate female CS percentages. So yes, because we have state, gender, and perhaps if we have more info, but the data set includes state and gender. So yes, B can be answered.

Option C: Compare GPAs, so yes.

Wait, but wait the question is which of the options can be answered by analyzing the data set. So, for each option, the question is whether the data can answer it. So the options are presented as questions, and we need to see which can be answered by the data.

So let me reevaluate each option:

A: Can we find the percentage of CS students who are in sports? No, because data set doesn't include that info.

B: For each state, compute female CS percentage. Yes, because the data includes state and gender.

C: Does CS students have higher GPAs than others? Yes, because data has GPAs.

D: Average age? No, no data.

E: Most common second major. No, no data on second majors.

F: Which college has the most CS students. No, data doesn't give that.

G: What percent of CS students get financial aid. No.

H: What percent of students in a state are CS. No, because data doesn't have that.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me think again. The data includes state, gender, and GPA. The options given:

B: How many states have a higher percentage of female CS majors than male CS majors in that state.

Wait, wait, the question is, which of the following can be answered by analyzing the data set?

So for option B, the question is how many states have, for each state, the percentage of female CS majors higher than male. So, for each state, calculate the percentage of female students in CS, then compare across states. So yes, with the data, we can calculate each state's percentage, and then count how many states have female > male.

So option B can be answered.

Option C: Do CS students have higher GPAs than others. Yes, because we have GPAs for each student.

Wait, but the options are yes/no questions. So the options are questions, and the answer is whether it can be answered.

So:

A: Can't be answered.

B: Can be answered.

C: Can be answered.

D: Can't.

E: Can't.

F: Can't.

G: Can't.

H: Can't.

Wait but wait, looking again, the options are presented as:

A: What is the percentage of CS students who participate in sports?

But the data doesn't include that information. So no.

B: How many states have a higher percentage of female CS majors than male CS majors in that state?

Yes, possible.

C: Do CS students tend to have higher GPAs than students in other subjects?

Yes, possible.

D: What is the average age of CS students.

No.

E: What is the most common second major.

No.

F: Which college has the highest number of CS students.

No.

G: What percent of CS students receive financial aid.

No.

H: What percent of students attending college in a certain state are CS.

No.

Wait, wait. So the correct ones are B and C.

Wait, but let me recheck each option.

Option B: How many states have a higher percentage of female CS majors than male.

So for each state, calculate the percentage of female CS students, then compare across states. So yes, the data includes state, gender, and if you have CS data, you can calculate this.

Option C: Do CS students tend to have higher GPAs.

So, yes, since the data includes GPAs.

But wait, the options are phrased as questions, so each is a yes/no question.

Wait, the options are phrased as yes/no questions, but the data is about CS students. So yes, B and C can be answered.

Wait, but the options are presented as questions, and the answers are the options, which are letters. So the correct answers for the question are which of the options can be answered.

So the correct options are B and C.

Wait, but the options given are:

A: Can't be answered

B: Can be

C: Can be

D: Can't

E: Can't

F: Can't

G: Can't

H: Can't

So the possible answers are B and C.

Wait, but looking back at the original options, the user lists the options as A to H. The correct answers would be B and C.

Wait, but wait, the user's question says "Which of the following questions could be answered by analyzing only information in the data set?"

So the options are the four letter words, each of which is a question. The correct answers are B and C.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me recheck.

Wait, the options presented are:

A: What percentage of students majoring in CS who participate in sports?

No, because data doesn't have that info.

B: How many states have higher female CS percentage than male.

Yes.

C: Do CS students have higher GPAs than other subjects.

Yes.

D: Average age.

No.

E: Most common second major.

No.

F: Which college has the most CS students.

No.

G: Percentage of CS students with aid.

No.

H: Percentage of students in a state that are CS.

No.

Wait, but the question is to choose which of the options (A to H) can be answered. So for each option, is it possible to answer based on the data?

Wait, the options are:

B: How many states have a higher female CS percentage than male.

So, to answer that, for each state, you have to compute female CS percentage, then see which states have higher than male. So yes, the data includes state, gender, and possibly the data about CS students. If the data is stored, for each state, you can calculate the percentage.

So, the correct answers are B and C.

Wait, but looking at the options in the user's problem statement, the possible answers are A to H, each being a question. So which of these can be answered?

So the correct answers would be options B and C.

Wait, but I thought the options are the options to choose from, but the user's question is which of the following can be answered. So the options are B and C.

Wait, but wait, the question in the user's problem is: "Which of the following questions could be answered by analyzing only information in the data set?"

So the answer is the options that can be answered. So the correct options are B and C.

But the user presents the options as A to H, each being a question. So the correct answers are B and C.

Wait, but wait, the options are presented as:

A: Can't be answered.

B: Can be.

C: Can be.

D: Can't.

E: Can't.

F: Can't.

G: Can't.

H: Can't.

So the correct answers are options B and C.

Wait, but looking again, the user's question's options are presented as A to H, each a question. The original data includes student's gender, state, and GPAs. So:

B: How many states have a higher percentage of female CS majors than male.

So, yes, we can compute for each state. So B can be answered.

C: Do CS students tend to have higher GPAs than others.

Yes, because data includes GPAs.

So the correct options are B and C.

But the user presented the options as A to H, each being a choice. So the correct answers would be B and C.

But the user's question, in the options, lists the possible answers as A to H, each being a question. So the correct answers are B and C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the user presented options A to H as the possible answers, with each being a question, and the correct answers are which can be answered.

In the problem, the user wants to select which of the following (A-H) can be answered. So the user is providing four options (A-H), each of which is a question, and the correct answers are the letters B and C. But in the user's initial question, he lists the options as:

A: What is the percentage of students majoring in computer science who also participate in sports?

B: How many states have a higher percentage of female computer science majors than male computer science majors attending college in that state?

C: Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects?

D: What is the average age of students majoring in computer science?

E: What is the most common second major for students majoring in computer science?

F: Which college has the highest number of students majoring in computer science?

G: What percent of computer science majors receive financial aid?

H: What percent of students attending college in a certain state are majoring in computer science?

So the correct answers are B and C, because each can be answered with the data provided.

Wait, but the user's original question is, which of the following (A to H) can be answered by analyzing the data set. So the correct answers are B and C.

So in the options, the correct answers are B and C, which are options B and C.

But the user's question is asking which of the following (A to H) can be answered, so the correct answers are B and C.

But the user's initial instruction says that the user should choose the letter (A to H) that is the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, the original question is:

Which of the following questions could be answered by analyzing only information in the data set?

The options are A to H, each a question.

So the user is asking which of the options (A to H) can be answered.

So the correct options are B and C.

Wait, but wait—let me double-check for option B and C.

Wait, option B is about the number of states where female CS students are more than male. The data includes state, gender, and perhaps the count. So for each state, I can compute the percentage of female CS students, then compare across states. So yes, B can be answered.

Option C: Do CS students tend to have higher GPAs than others. The data includes GPAs, so this can be answered.

So the correct answers are B and C.

Wait, but wait, the user is listing the options as A to H, each of which is a question. So the correct answers are B and C.

But in the problem, the user says, which of the following could be answered, and the options are A to H. So the answer is B and C.

But the user has options A to H, and the possible answer is which ones can be answered.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the user's question is a bit ambiguous. But according to the data, the correct answers are B and C.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I've made a mistake. Oh wait, option C: Do CS students tend to have higher GPAs than students in other subjects?

Wait, the data doesn't include information about other subjects. So if the question is about CS students comparing their GPAs with all other students, that's a different matter. But the data doesn't include that, so maybe it's not possible.

Wait, no, the data includes the student's GPAs, but it doesn't include other subjects. Wait, the data has information about each student's GPA, but not about other subjects. So the question in option C asks about CS students' GPAs compared to all students, not just other CS students. So the question is, for all CS students, their GPAs are higher than all students (including other CS students). But the data doesn't include all students, only CS students.

Wait, but the question is whether, on average, CS students have higher GPAs than other students. But the data doesn't include other students. So it's impossible to answer C as presented.

Oh wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. So, the data includes GPAs, but not other subjects. So if the question is about CS students' GPAs compared to all other students, which is not provided by the data, then option C can't be answered.

So I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Option C: Do CS students tend to have higher GPAs than students in other subjects.

No, because the data doesn't have information about students in other subjects. So it's not possible to answer C.

So, the correct options are B and A? No, I thought A and C were wrong.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me reevaluate:

Option A: What percentage of CS students are in sports? The data has gender and state, but no info on sports. So can't be answered.

Option B: How many states have a higher percentage of female CS majors than male. The data includes state, gender, and perhaps the count. So for each state, calculate female percentage and compare. So yes.

Option C: Do CS students have higher GPAs than others. The data includes GPAs, but not other subjects. So the question is, for each CS student, is their GPA higher than all students (including non-CS)? But the data doesn't have information about all students, only CS students. So the question is not answerable.

Option D: Average age of CS students. No, data doesn't include age.

Option E: Most common second major. No, data doesn't have that info.

Option F: Which college has the most CS students. No, data doesn't have that info.

Option G: What percent of CS students receive financial aid. No.

Option H: What percent of students in a certain state are CS. No.

So the correct answers are only B.

Wait, but earlier I thought B is correct.

Wait, but wait, what about option H? The data doesn't have information about the state's students, so H can't be answered.

So, the only correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me think more carefully about option B.

Option B: How many states have a higher percentage of female CS majors than male.

The data includes, for each state, the number of female and male CS students. So for each state, I can compute the percentage of female CS students, then compare it to the percentage of male CS students. Then, for each state, determine if female > male.

So for each state, I can compute the percentage, and then count how many states have female percentage higher than male.

So yes, the data is sufficient to answer this.

So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but the user's initial options include option B and others.

So the correct choice is option B.
</think>

The correct answer is **B**. 

### Explanation:
The data includes information about each student's gender, state, and gender point average (GPA). To answer option B, we can calculate the percentage of female CS students in each state and compare it with the percentage of male CS students. This comparison can then be made across all states, allowing us to determine how many states have a higher percentage of female CS majors than male CS majors.

### Analysis of Other Options:
- **A**: We cannot determine the percentage of CS students who participate in sports because the data lacks information on this topic.
- **C**: We cannot answer this question because the data does not include information about students in other subjects.
- **D, E, F, G, H**: None of these questions can be answered with the provided data. For example, option D requires the average age of CS students, which is not available, and option H asks about the percentage of students in a certain state who are CS, which is also not provided.

Thus, the only question that can be answered with the given information is **B**.

ANSWER: B
