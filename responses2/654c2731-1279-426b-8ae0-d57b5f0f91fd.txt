Okay, so I have this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which ratio can't form a proportion with 8 over 18. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that two ratios form a proportion if their cross products are equal. So, for example, if I have 8/18 and another ratio a/b, they form a proportion if 8 * b = 18 * a.

So the plan is to check each option to see if the cross products are equal. Let's list out the options:

A: 60/135
B: 46/108
C: 12/27
D: 4/9

Starting with option A: 60 and 135.

I need to see if 8 * 135 equals 18 * 60. Let me calculate both sides.

8 * 135 = 1080
18 * 60 = 1080
They are equal, so A forms a proportion. So A is out.

Option B: 46/108.

Check 8 * 108 vs 18 *46.

8 * 108 = 864
18 *46 = 828
Wait, 864 is not equal to 828, so this doesn't form a proportion. Hmm, but wait, did I do the math right?

Wait, 18 × 46: 10×46=460, 8×46=368; 460+368=828. Yes, that's correct. And 8×108: 8×100=800, 8×8=64; 800+64=864. So 864 ≠ 828. So B doesn't form a proportion. But wait, the question is which cannot form a proportion. So B is a candidate. But I need to check all options to be sure.

Option C: 12/27.

Check 8 *27 and 18 *12.

8 *27 = 216
18 *12 = 216
They are equal. So C forms a proportion. So C is out.

Option D:4/9.

Check 8 *9 and 18 *4.

8 *9=72
18 *4=72
They are equal. So D is a proportion. So D is out.

So the only option that doesn't form a proportion is B. So the answer should be option B.

The correct answer is B: 46 over 108 cannot form a proportion with 8 over 18 because the cross products do not equal (8*108 ≠ 18*46). 

Answer: B
