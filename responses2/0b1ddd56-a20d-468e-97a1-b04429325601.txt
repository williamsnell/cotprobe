Question:

A car manufacturer produced a car that was sold nationwide. Problems with the car's brakes allegedly caused several accidents and injuries. Two individual buyers of the car each filed a class action, in different states, against the manufacturer, asserting the same products liability claims on behalf of all buyers nationwide. One class action was filed in federal court and the other was filed in state court. The parties in the federal action reached a court- approved settlement, and the court entered judgment dismissing the action with prejudice. The manufacturer's attorney has moved to dismiss the state court action on the basis of res judicata (claim preclusion). Should the state court look to federal or state law to decide the effect of the judgment?

Options:

A: Federal law, because the judgment was the result of a nationwide action governed by the federal class action rule.
B: Federal law, due to the nationwide scope of the car manufacturer's operations.
C: State law, because there is no general federal common law and preclusion is a common law doctrine.
D: State law, because the claim involves product liability, a matter of state law.
E: Federal law, because the judgment was entered in federal court.
F: Federal law, because the manufacturer's attorney filed the motion.
G: Federal law, because the claim involves a product that was sold nationwide.
H: State law, because the accidents and injuries happened in multiple states.
I: State law, because the second class action was filed in state court.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it again and break it down.

There's a car manufacturer that made a car sold nationwide. Two buyers each filed class actions against them, one in federal court and one in state court. The federal action settled with a court, and it dismissed the action with prejudice. Now the manufacturer's attorney is arguing to dismiss the state action based on res judicata, which is the claim preclusion rule. The question is whether the state court should look to federal or state law to determine the effect of the judgment.

Hmm, res judicata is when a court action cannot be dismissed because it's a matter of state law, so the state's law applies. But wait, the federal action was dismissed with prejudice, which means the state action can be dismissed because it's a state matter.

Wait, so the federal court dismissed the action, so the state court's action isn't subject to res judicata. Because the issue is about state law, not federal. So the state court can proceed under its own state laws.

Wait, but the manufacturers' attorney is trying to dismiss the state action on the basis of res judicata. So the question is whether the state court should look to either federal (which the federal action was dismissed, so maybe state can't) or state law.

Wait, no. The state action is a state matter, so any state action is subject to its own state law. So the federal action being dismissed doesn't affect the state's claim.

So the motion to dismiss should be based on state law. Because the state action is about state law, and under res judicata, the state's law is the one that applies.

Alternatively, if the state action was dismissed with prejudice, then the state court can't proceed, but the question is whether the state court should look to the federal or state law. So, the state court's legal basis is its own state law.

Wait, but the options include F: Federal law, because the manufacturer's attorney filed the motion. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says the manufacturer's attorney moved to dismiss the state court action on res judicata grounds. The issue is whether the state court should look to federal or state law.

Wait, res judicata applies to state matters, so the state court's action is subject to state law. So the state court can proceed under its own state law. The fact that the federal action was dismissed doesn't affect the state action's preclusion.

So, the state court should look to state law, which is option H: State law, because the accidents and injuries happened in multiple states.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the entire situation is a state action. The state's court action is about state matters, so the judgment from federal court would affect the state's case. But the question is whether the state court can dismiss because of res judicata.

Wait, the issue is whether the state court should look to federal or state law. So the state's answer would be based on state law, because the action in question is a state matter. So the motion should be based on state law.

So the answer is option H: State law, because the claim involves product liability, a matter of state law.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option H: State law, because the accidents and injuries happened in multiple states.

Wait, but the question is about the effect of the judgment. The judgment was from the federal court, but res judicata in the state action is about state law. So the state court's decision should be based on their own state law, not the federal court's result.

So the correct answer should be H. Because the state action is a state matter, so the state court can proceed under their own laws. The federal action's judgment may affect the state's claim, but the state's action is subject to state law.

But wait, the question is whether the state court should look to federal or state law. So the state's legal basis would be state law. So the motion should be based on state law, so the answer is H.
</think>

The correct answer is H: State law, because the claim involves product liability, a matter of state law.

**Explanation:** 
The issue revolves around whether the state court should look to federal or state law to determine the effect of the judgment. The state action is governed by state law, not federal law, even though the federal action was dismissed. Res judicata applies to state matters, meaning the state court's action is subject to its own state laws. Therefore, the state court should proceed under its own state law, not federal law. 

ANSWER: H
