Okay, so I've got this problem about the impedance of an inductor at different angular frequencies. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about a 1-henry inductor. I remember that inductors have an impedance that depends on their inductance and the angular frequency. Oh right, impedance is the product of the inductance and the reactance. Reactance for an inductor is Lω, where ω is the angular frequency.

So, the formula for impedance (Z) of an inductor should be Z = L * ω. Since the inductance L is 1 henry, it simplifies to Z = ω. Wait, that's interesting because for an inductor, the impedance increases with frequency. So higher frequency, higher impedance.

The question gives three different frequencies: 100 rad/s, 1000 rad/s, and 10,000 rad/s. So I'll plug each into the formula.

For 100 rad/s: Z = 1 * 100 = 100 ohms.
For 1000 rad/s: Z = 1 * 1000 = 1000 ohms.
For 10,000 rad/s: Z = 1 * 10,000 = 10,000 ohms.

Looking at the options, let me check. 

Option B lists 100, 1000, 10,000 ohms. That seems to match exactly what I calculated.

Wait, wait, but let me make sure. Another thought: Oh, wait, sometimes inductors are measured in ohms, but I don't see any in the options that match my calculated values. Let me check the options again.

Option B: the numbers are 100, 1000, 10,000. Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the answer should be option B.

To determine the impedance of a 1-henry inductor at angular frequencies of 100, 1000, and 10,000 rad/s, we use the formula for impedance of an inductor:

\[
Z = L \cdot \omega
\]

Where:
- \( L = 1 \, \text{H} \) (inductance),
- \( \omega \) is the angular frequency.

Calculations:
1. For \( \omega = 100 \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   Z = 1 \cdot 100 = 100 \, \Omega
   \]

2. For \( \omega = 1000 \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   Z = 1 \cdot 1000 = 1000 \, \Omega
   \]

3. For \( \omega = 10,000 \, \text{rad/s} \):
   \[
   Z = 1 \cdot 10,000 = 10,000 \, \Omega
   \]

The calculated impedance values (100, 1000, 10,000 Ω) match **Option B**.
