Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about international market research equivalence. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT one of the equivalences. The options are A to D: Functional equivalence, Translation equivalence, Conceptual equivalence, and Market equivalence.

Hmm, I remember that equivalence in research is about ensuring that the target market is comparable to the source market. There are a few types, like conceptual, functional, and translation equivalence.

Wait, conceptual equivalence is when the target and source markets are structurally similar. That makes sense because you want the same kinds of products or services. So option C would be correct, so it's not the answer.

Functional equivalence is when the target and source have the same functions and users. Like, both are in the same industry and operate in the same way. So A is a valid equivalence, so it's not the wrong one.

Translation equivalence is about the same product or service in different languages and countries. That's definitely functional, so B is a correct equivalence, so not the answer.

Now, the question is which one is NOT one of the equivalences. The options are the ones listed. So looking at the options, the one that's not any of these would be the answer.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. So the question is which is not an equivalence. Since all except one are valid, I need to find the wrong one.

Wait, another thought: maybe the options are differing. Let me think again. The question says which is NOT one of the equivalences. So the correct answer is the one that's not any of the equivalences.

So option D is Market equivalence. Wait, isn't that a type of functional equivalence? Or is it a different concept?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. There are three types: conceptual, functional, and translation. So all three are valid. So the question is which one is not any of these. So the options are A, B, C, D. D is Market equivalence.

Wait, but wait, is Market equivalence the same as functional? Or is it a different type. Alternatively, maybe the fourth type is being considered here.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try to recall. I think the four types are:

1. Conceptual equivalence: the same product and service across cultures.
2. Functional equivalence: same functions, same users, same markets.
3. Translation equivalence: same product in different languages, same markets, same countries.
4. Market equivalence: same market structure but in different locations.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the options are just three types, and the fourth is not considered.

Wait, the question says there are three types of equivalence, so the options are the three. So the question is which of the four is not one of them. But the options are A to D, which are four. So perhaps the options are four, but only three are valid. Alternatively, maybe the options are incomplete.

Wait, the question lists four options, but the question states that three are types. So perhaps the four options are four, but the correct answer is one that's not any of the three.

Wait, the question says the three types, so the fourth option is not one of the equivalences.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the options wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are:

A: Functional
B: Translation
C: Conceptual
D: Market

The question is asking which is NOT one of the equivalences. So, if all the options except one are valid, then the one that is not a type is the answer.

Wait, but the four types are conceptual, functional, translation, and market equivalence. So the options don't include that fourth. But the question says that the correct answer is one of the four, so the answer is the fourth type.

Wait, no. Because the question says that there are three types, so the four options probably include the third type, but one of them is the fourth.

Wait, wait, the question says that three types are there. The options are four, so one of them is not. So which one is it?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is a multiple-choice question where the options are four, but three are the correct equivalences.

Wait, the question is: which is NOT one of the equivalences? So the answer is the one not in the three types.

If the three types are functional, conceptual, translation, then D (market equivalence) is not one of the three. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of it this way. The options are four, but three are correct. The wrong one is the fourth type.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the four types and the options are four, but only three are correct. So the options given are four, but the correct answer is the one that's not any of the three.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if the question's options include four possibilities, but only three are valid, then the fourth is the correct answer.

So looking at the options, the four options are A, B, C, D. But the question says there are three types. So the fourth type is not one of the equivalences.

Wait, I'm getting myself stuck. Let me think: the three types are functional, conceptual, translation. So the correct answer is D, which is Market equivalence, because it's not an equivalence. So the answer is D.

To determine which of the options is NOT one of the equivalences in international market research, we first identify the three types of equivalence: functional, conceptual, and translation. These are the valid equivalences listed in the options (A, B, and C). 

The fourth option, D (Market equivalence), refers to a concept that may not be considered a distinct equivalence in this context. Therefore, it is the one that is NOT one of the equivalences.

**Answer: D**
