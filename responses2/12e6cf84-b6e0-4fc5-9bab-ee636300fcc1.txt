Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about octet and Lewis structures. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which of the given compounds or ions has an octet of electrons around the central atom. The options are A to E.

Wait, what's a Lewis structure octet? Oh right, in a Lewis structure, the central atom should have eight electrons around it. That's the octet rule, right? So each of the central atoms in the molecule should have eight electrons in its valence shell.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: BF3. So Boron trifluoride. Boron is in group 3, so it can have up to three bonds. If each F is a single bond, then each F contributes one electron, and Boron contributes three. So Boron has three bonds with F, and each F has three bonds (so three bonds each). Boron's valence: B typically has three valence electrons, but wait, in BF3, each F contributes one, so Boron's valence would be 3 (from F) + its own valence? Wait, no. Wait, the central atom is Boron. Boron has a valency of 3 (since it can form 3 bonds). Each F is a Lewis electron donor. So Boron has three F atoms attached. Boron's valency is three, so the central atom would have 3 (from F) + 3 (from itself?) Wait, no. Wait, Lewis structures for central atoms focus on bonding. Boron has three bonds, each F has three lone pairs perhaps? Or maybe each F donates one, so Boron has three bonds, which is its valency. So Boron's valence would be three, but in the structure, it's connected to three F atoms. Wait, but Boron's valence electrons: Boron has 3 valence electrons. The F atoms each have 7. So in BF3, Boron is in the center.

So the Lewis structure would be Boron connected to three F atoms. Boron's valence is 3 (from F) plus any lone pairs. Boron can have three bonds, so each F can contribute one. Boron would have three lone pairs? Wait, no, because Boron's valency is three, so it would have three bonds. Boron's valence electrons: 3 (from itself, but wait, no, wait: Boron is in group 3, so it can take three bonds. Each F is taking one, so Boron has three bonds, and each F has three lone pairs. Boron's valence electrons are 3 (from itself, assuming Boron is in group 3) but wait no, group 3 has valence 3. So for Boron in BF3, the Lewis structure would have Boron with three bonds (each F contributes one), Boron would have three lone pairs because it's 3 valence electrons (since it's in group 3, maybe it's 3 valence? Wait, group 3 has 3 valence electrons, but in a Lewis structure, the central atom's valence is its group number. So Boron has 3, and each F has 7.

So Boron:

B: 3 valence electrons. Each F: 7. Each bond is one electron. So Boron uses three electrons (three bonds), so Boron's valence electrons in the Lewis structure are 3 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Boron has three lone pairs (6 electrons) because 3 (from bonds) + 6 (from lone pairs) = 9 electrons? Wait, no, because Boron is the center. Let me think. Boron's valence electrons: 3. Each F contributes one, so Boron uses 3 (3 bonds). Boron's valence in the structure: 3 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. So Boron has 3 (from bonds) + any lone pairs. Boron has 6: 3 (from bonds) + 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) → total 9? No, wait, that can't be right because Boron can't have 9 electrons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Boron in BF3 has a Lewis structure where it has three bonds, each F has three lone pairs. Boron's valence is 3 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Boron's valence electrons in the Lewis structure: 3 (from bonds) + any lone pairs. Boron's group is 3, so it can have 3 bonds. So Boron's valence is 3. So in the Lewis structure, Boron has three lone pairs (6 electrons) plus the three bonds, so 3 +6= 9? That can't be. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Boron is the central atom. So, the Lewis formula would be BF3. Boron is in the center, with three F atoms attached. Boron has three bonds (each F contributes one). Boron's valence for the Lewis structure is 3 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Boron can have three lone pairs → so 3 (bonds) + 6 (lone pairs) = 9 electrons. But Boron can only have 3 + 6 = 9. Wait, but Boron's valence is 3. So the Lewis structure would have Boron with 3 (from bonds) plus 6 (lone pairs) → that's 9. But Boron's valency is 3, so perhaps it only has 3 electrons in the Lewis structure. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think again. Boron has 3 valence electrons. It forms three bonds, each with F. So each F contributes one, Boron contributes one each. So Boron's valence electrons in the Lewis structure: 3 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Wait, but Boron's valence electrons are 3 (group 3). So in the Lewis structure, Boron is connected via three bonds, so Boron's valence is 3 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Boron can have 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) because 3 +6=9. Wait, but Boron's original valence is 3. So the Lewis structure would show Boron with three lone pairs, which is 6 electrons, plus 3 bonds, making 9. But wait, Boron's valence electrons in the Lewis structure should be 8. Oh wait, because the Lewis structure is about the central atom's valence. Boron has 3 bonds, which is part of its valence. So Boron's total valence is 3 (from bonds) plus the lone pairs. Boron's valence is 3, so if it has three lone pairs, that's 3 (from bonds) + 6 (lone pairs) → 9, which is impossible. So my mistake must be elsewhere. Perhaps Boron has only three electrons in the Lewis structure? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the Lewis structure.

Wait, perhaps in BF3, Boron has 3 lone pairs. Boron's valence is 3 (from bonds) plus 6 (lone pairs) =9. That's more than 8, which violates the octet rule. So BF3 doesn't have an octet. Hmm, but the question is about which option has an octet. Wait, perhaps it's the other way: the central atom has 8 electrons in its valence shell. So Boron's valence is 3 (from bonding) plus any lone pairs. Boron can have 3 lone pairs (6) → 3 +6 =9 → which is more than 8, so it's not an octet. So BF3 doesn't have an octet. So option A is out.

Option B: BeF2. Beryllium difluoride. Beryllium is Be, atomic number 4. It's in group 2, so it can have 2 bonds. Each F is 7. So BeF2. So the Lewis structure would be Be connected to two F atoms.

So Be has a valency of 2. Each F brings one. So Be has two bonding pairs. Be's valence electrons in the Lewis structure: 2 (bonds) + any lone pairs. Be has 2 valence electrons. So if it has two lone pairs (4 electrons), then 2 +4=6. But wait, no, because Lewis structures focus on the central atom's valence. Be has 2 valence electrons in the central atom. So in the Lewis structure, Be has two bonding pairs (so two electrons from Be) and any lone pairs. So Be's valence electrons in the Lewis structure is 2 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. But Be can have a valence of 2. So if it has two lone pairs (4) → 2 (from bonds) +4 (lone) =6. But wait, that's 6 electrons, which is less than 8. So does BeF2 have an octet? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, wait. The Lewis structure for BeF2 would be Be in the center, two F atoms attached. Each F contributes one electron, so Be uses two. So Be is in the center with two bonds. Each F has three lone pairs. So, the Lewis structure would show Be with two single bonds to F, and Be would have two lone pairs (4 electrons). So the total valence electrons around Be would be 2 (bonds) + 4 (lone) =6. That's less than 8, so no octet. So option B does not have an octet. Hmm, but the question is which has an octet, so maybe I'm wrong.

Option C: PF5. Phosphorus pentachloride. Phosphorus is group 15, so it can have 5 bonds (assuming it's in a structure that forms a trigonal bipyramidal shape). Let me think about the Lewis structure. PF5 has five F atoms attached to P. So each F contributes one electron. But wait, phosphorus has 5 valence electrons. It forms five single bonds with F, so each bond uses one P electron. So P has 5 bonds (5 electrons from bonds) and any lone pairs. Wait, P's valence electrons in the Lewis structure would be 5 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. But phosphorus can have 5 lone pairs (10 electrons) → 5+10=15. That's way more than 8. So P is in a higher oxidation state; perhaps it's using 5 valence electrons? No, wait, the central atom is P.

Wait, let me think again. The Lewis structure for PF5: each F takes one bond. P has 5 bonds, so 5 electrons used (as bonds). Each F has 7 valence electrons. So each F contributes one, so P uses 5. Now the lone pairs on P: P has 5 valence electrons, but in the Lewis structure, it's used in 5 bonds. So P has 5 valence electrons used in bonds. So how many lone pairs? Each bond uses one P electron. So P has 5 electrons used in bonds, but that's not right. Wait, no. Each bond is a single pair. So P has 5 bonds, so 5 P atoms (each contributing one) used. So P's valence in the Lewis structure is 5 (bonds) plus any lone pairs. But phosphorus can have 5 lone pairs (10 electrons) → so P has 5 (bonds) +10 (lone) =15 electrons. That's way more than 8. So PF5 does not have an octet for the central P. So C is out.

Option D: NH4+. Ammonium ion. NH4+ is a common ion. The Lewis structure. ammonium has NH4+.

Ammonium: N is the central atom. It has four bonds. So each H is bonded to N. So N has four bonds (each H contributes one). N's valence electrons in the structure: four bonds (four electrons) plus any lone pairs. N's valence is 5 (from group 15). So N uses four electrons in bonds. So N has 5 -4=1 lone pair. So N has two lone pairs, which is 4 electrons. So N's valence is 4 (from lone pairs) +4 (bonds) =8? No, wait, the Lewis structure is about the central atom's octet. So N has four bonds, each H contributes one, making four electrons from N. N's valence electrons in the Lewis structure: 4 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. So N's valence electrons are 5 (since it's in group 15). So if N has four electrons in bonds, then it has one lone pair (two electrons). So total: 4 (bonds) + 2 (lone) =6, which is less than 8. So N doesn't have an octet. Wait, but the central atom's octet? So, yes, N's valence is 6, which is not 8. So NH4+ doesn't have an octet. So option D is out.

Option E: SF6. Sulfur hexafluoride. Sulfur is the central atom. Each F is bonded to S. So six F atoms. Each F contributes one electron. Sulfur has six valence electrons, but in the Lewis structure, it's using six bonds, each with one S electron. So S uses six electrons in bonds. Sulfur's valence in the structure: six (bonds) + any lone pairs. S can have 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) → 6 (bonds) +6 (lone)=12. That's more than 8. So sulfur doesn't have an octet. So E is out.

Wait, but wait. I thought some of these have octets. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in some cases. Let me think again.

Option B: BeF2.

Be has a valency of 2 (as it's group 2). Each F brings one.

So, Be has two bonds (each F contributes one). So Be has two electrons from bonds, and any lone pairs. Be's valence electrons in the Lewis structure: 2 (from bonds) + any lone pairs. Be can have 2 lone pairs (4 electrons) → 2 +4=6. So that’s 6 electrons around Be, which is less than 8. So no octet. So option B doesn't have an octet.

Wait, but perhaps in the Lewis structure, the central atom's octet is considered. So, in Beryllium difluoride, Be is the central atom. Its valence electrons in the Lewis structure: 2 (from two bonds) plus any lone pairs. So if Be has two lone pairs (4) → 2 +4=6 → that's 6 electrons. So no octet. So option B doesn't have an octet.

Wait, but what about the other options? I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, I'm going through all options again. Let me check each again.

Option A: BF3. Boron has three bonds, each F contributes one. Boron's valence: 3 (bonds) + any lone pairs. Boron can have 3 lone pairs (6 electrons) → 3+6=9. Which is more than 8 → no octet.

Option B: BeF2. Be has two bonds, each F contributes one. Be's valence is 2 (bonds) + lone pairs. Be can have two lone pairs → 2 +4=6 → doesn't have octet.

Option C: PF5. P has five bonds. Each F contributes one. So P has five bonds → five electrons. P can have 5 lone pairs (10 electrons) → 5 +10=15. So no octet.

Option D: NH4+. N has four bonds. Each H contributes one. N has four bonds → four electrons. N can have two lone pairs → 4 +4=8. Oh wait! Wait, N's valence in the Lewis structure is N's valence electrons (4 from bonds) plus any lone pairs (4) → 8. So yes, N has an octet here. So option D's central atom N has an octet.

So, the correct answer is D.

To determine which compound or ion has an octet of electrons around the central atom, we analyze each option as follows:

### Option A: BF₃  
Boron trifluoride (BF₃) consists of Boron as the central atom, bonded to three fluorine atoms. Boron has a valency of 3, so it forms three bonds with fluorine. Each fluorine contributes one electron to the bond. Boron's valence electrons in the Lewis structure are 3 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Boron can have three lone pairs (6 electrons), giving a total of 9 electrons around it. This exceeds the octet rule, so BF₃ does not have an octet.

### Option B: BeF₂  
Beryllium difluoride (BeF₂) has beryllium as the central atom, bonded to two fluorine atoms. Beryllium has a valency of 2, so it forms two bonds with fluorine. Each fluorine contributes one electron to the bond. Beryllium's valence electrons in the Lewis structure are 2 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Beryllium can have two lone pairs (4 electrons), giving a total of 6 electrons around it. This does not satisfy the octet rule, so BeF₂ does not have an octet.

### Option C: PF₅  
Phosphorus pentachloride (PF₅) has phosphorus as the central atom, bonded to five chlorine atoms. Phosphorus has a valency of 5, so it forms five bonds with chlorine. Each bond uses one phosphorus electron, and all five bonds are single bonds. Phosphorus's valence electrons in the Lewis structure are 5 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Phosphorus can have five lone pairs (10 electrons), giving a total of 15 electrons around it. This exceeds the octet rule, so PF₅ does not have an octet.

### Option D: NH₄⁺  
Ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) has nitrogen as the central atom, bonded to four hydrogen atoms. Nitrogen has a valency of 3, so it forms three bonds with hydrogen. Each bond uses one nitrogen electron, and all three bonds are single bonds. Nitrogen's valence electrons in the Lewis structure are 3 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Nitrogen can have two lone pairs (4 electrons), giving a total of 8 electrons around it. This satisfies the octet rule, so NH₄⁺ has an octet.

### Option E: SF₆  
Sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆) has sulfur as the central atom, bonded to six fluorine atoms. Sulfur has a valency of 6, so it forms six bonds with fluorine. Each bond uses one sulfur electron, and all six bonds are single bonds. Sulfur's valence electrons in the Lewis structure are 6 (from bonds) plus any lone pairs. Sulfur can have three lone pairs (6 electrons), giving a total of 12 electrons around it. This exceeds the octet rule, so SF₆ does not have an octet.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, only NH₄⁺ has an octet of electrons around the central atom.
