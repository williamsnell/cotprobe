Question:

Research on explicit (intentional) and implicit (automatic) memory indicates that

Options:

A: both forms of memory fluctuate in capacity throughout the adult life span
B: neither forms of memory are affected by age, only by a disease process like Alzheimer’s
C: both forms of memory show a fairly consistent, gradual decline over the adult life span
D: both forms of memory remain stable, except when affected by a disease process like Alzheimer’s
E: explicit memory capacity remains stable, while implicit memory capacity declines with age
F: implicit memory capacity declines with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable
G: both forms of memory increase their capacity with age
H: implicit memory capacity increases with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable
I: explicit memory capacity increases with age, while implicit memory capacity declines
J: explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable

Okay, so I have this question about explicit and implicit memory and what they do with age. Hmm, I remember from my studies that both types of memory are important but function differently. Let me think through this.

So, the question is asking which statement is correct regarding how explicit and implicit memory capacities change with age. The options are A to J, each making a claim.

First, let me recall what explicit and implicit memory are. Explicit memory is the conscious, deliberate storage of information, like when you remember a class example. Implicit memory is automatic, without conscious effort, like when you recognize someone's face quickly. 

I think about how these memories develop over time. I remember that both types of memory are usually stable in their capacity until a certain age. But their capacity might decline as people age. Wait, but which one is which?

Wait, I think both are usually stable in their capacity. That is, their ability to store information doesn't change as a group much until later in life. So maybe both are stable. But does that mean their capacity remains the same?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I think some sources say that explicit memory is usually more stable than implicit. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: I remember that explicit memory is often more robust, maybe more stable. Because the brain has to process the information through the prefrontal cortex, which might support explicit memory. But how does this affect their capacity with age?

Wait, perhaps both become less stable as people age. Or maybe they both get less capacity? No, I think their capacity isn't affected too much. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option A says both fluctuate (so both go up and down) throughout the adult life. That doesn't sound right. I thought both are stable, so their capacity doesn't go up or down much. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says neither is affected by age like Alzheimer's. No, because both types of memory are affected by age. So B is wrong.

Option C: Both show a gradual decline. But wait, I think both maybe decline, but maybe not as much as one. So I'm not sure C is correct.

Option D: Both remain stable, except diseases. So if both stay the same, except for certain conditions, then D would be correct. But I think both have capacity changes, so D is probably wrong.

Option E: Explicit increases, implicit declines. I don't think that's right. Both tend to decline, not increase.

Option F: Implicit declines but explicit remains. Hmm. So if that's correct, then F would be right. But I'm not sure.

Option G: Both increase with age. I don't think so. I thought both remain stable, so G is wrong.

Option H: Implicit increases, explicit remains. I think implicit might decrease more, so H is probably not correct.

Option I: Explicit increases, implicit declines. So explicit increases, which I don't think is the case.

Option J: Explicit declines, implicit remains. So J says explicit decreases, which I think is correct, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I should clarify. I think both types of memory have capacity changes. Explicit memory capacity might decrease with age. Because as we age, the brain's ability to process and store explicit memories may decline. For example, older adults might have trouble with explicit tasks that require conscious attention.

But about implicit memory, I think it's more stable. People don't have as much trouble with implicit tasks as they do explicit ones. So maybe implicit memory capacity doesn't change as much with age, but explicit does.

Wait, but some sources say that both have capacity changes. So both are affected by age, and their capacity decreases as people get older. So that would mean that explicit is declining, and implicit is stable.

Looking back at the options, which one matches that. Option F says implicit declines, but explicit remains. That sounds right.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think: when I think of memory, I remember that both explicit and implicit are affected. So their capacity changes. But perhaps explicit is more about conscious storage and declines, while implicit is automatic and remains stable.

So if that's the case, option F would be correct: implicit declines, explicit remains stable.

Wait, but earlier I thought that both form of memory show a gradual decline. So both would decline. So option C says both decline, which would be correct. Alternatively, maybe both increase. Maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Another angle: I've heard that explicit memory capacity is more robust and stable, but I'm not sure about age effects. Alternatively, I've read that both are affected by age, but implicit memory capacity is more stable.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: implicit memory declines, explicit stays stable.

So looking at the options, option F is: "implicit memory capacity declines with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable."

Yes, that aligns with the idea that both are affected, and explicit is stable, implicit declines.

The question concerns the behavior of explicit (intentional) and implicit (automatic) memory as age progresses. Here's the analysis:

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. Both types of memory are generally stable in their capacity throughout life, so their capacity does not fluctuate randomly.

2. **Option B**: Incorrect. Both types of memory are influenced by age, contrary to the claim that neither is affected by age.

3. **Option C**: Incorrect. While both types of memory show changes over time, their capacity does not decline gradually but is more stable.

4. **Option D**: Incorrect. Both types of memory experience capacity changes, so neither remains stable.

5. **Option E**: Incorrect. Both types of memory experience changes, so neither increases with age.

6. **Option F**: Correct. Implicit memory capacity declines with age, while explicit memory capacity remains stable.

7. **Option G**: Incorrect. Both types of memory are affected by age.

8. **Option H**: Incorrect. Implicit memory capacity does not increase with age; it declines.

9. **Option I**: Incorrect. Explicit memory capacity also declines with age.

10. **Option J**: Incorrect. Explicit memory capacity does not decline with age; it remains stable.

The correct answer is **F**, as it accurately reflects the known behavior of memory types: implicit memory declines, while explicit remains stable.

Answer: F
