Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a curling stone. Hmm, let's see. Let me try to figure this out step by step. So the stone has a mass of 1 slug. I remember that slug is a unit of mass used in the English system, right? So, the stone is moving along the ice and comes to rest after 100 feet. The kinetic friction is 1/2 lb. I need to find the initial velocity and the time it took to stop.

Wait, I think kinetic friction is the force opposing the motion. So, the frictional force is 1/2 lb. Oh, but wait, I need to convert that into a force because Newton's laws probably require force in terms of mass and acceleration. Oh right, Newton's second law is F=ma, so I need to find the acceleration first.

Frictional force is 0.5 lb. But wait, I should convert that into pounds-force. Since 1 lb is a force. Oh, but wait, in the English system, the unit of force is pounds (lb), but for mass, it's slugs. So, the formula is F = μ * m * g, but wait, no, because in the English system, F in pounds is equal to mass in slugs multiplied by acceleration due to gravity in ft/s². Because F (lb) = m (slug) * g (ft/s²). So, since g is 32 ft/s², then for 1 lb, that would mean 1 lb = 1 slug * 32 ft/s². So yeah, F = μ * m * g.

Wait, but in this case, the frictional force is given as 0.5 lb. So, F_friction = 0.5 lb. So substituting into F = μ * m * g, 0.5 = μ * 1 * 32. So μ is 0.5 / 32, which is 1/64. But wait, I'm not sure if μ is needed here. Because maybe I don't need the coefficient of friction because I have the frictional force directly. Wait, no, because F = μ * N. If I'm on ice, the normal force N is equal to the weight of the stone, which is m * g. So N = m * g = 1 slug * 32 ft/s² = 32 lb. So the frictional force is μ * 32 lb. But the problem says the kinetic friction is 1/2 lb. So 1/2 = μ * 32. Thus μ = (1/2)/32 = 1/(64). So the coefficient is 1/64.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe I can proceed without it. Because I know the frictional force is 0.5 lb, and I can relate that to the acceleration.

Wait, frictional force is equal to mass times acceleration of the stone. Because F = ma. Wait, but that's only if the acceleration is constant. Wait, but in this case, the stone is slowing down, so the acceleration is negative. So frictional force is acting opposite to the motion, so F_friction = - (mass) * a. So the magnitude is mass times acceleration. So 0.5 lb = 1 slug * a. Wait, but wait, units! Because 0.5 lb equals 1 slug times acceleration. But I need to think about the units carefully. Since F is in lb, which is a force, and slug is a mass. So when I do F = ma, F is in lb, m is in slug, a is in ft/s². So 0.5 lb = 1 slug * a. So a = 0.5 ft/s². But wait, since the stone is slowing down, the acceleration is negative. So a = -0.5 ft/s².

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Let me double-check. F = ma. F is 0.5 lb. m is 1 slug. So a = F/m = 0.5 /1 = 0.5 ft/s². But since it's opposite to the direction of motion, I think the acceleration is negative. So a = -0.5 ft/s². So the stone is decelerating at 0.5 ft/s².

But wait, another approach. Since I know the initial velocity (v0), final velocity (v=0), the distance traveled (s=100 ft), and the acceleration (a = -0.5 ft/s²), I can use the kinematic equation: v² = u² + 2 a s.

Wait, yes. So v is 0. u is the initial velocity (what we're solving for). a is -0.5. s is 100. So substituting:

0 = u² + 2*(-0.5)*100

Simplify: 0 = u² - 100

So u² = 100 → u = 10 ft/s.

Wait, so the initial velocity is 10 ft/s. So looking at the options, option A says initial velocity 10 ft/s, time 20 s. But wait, what about the time?

Hmm, I need to find the time it took to stop. So I can use the equation: v = u + a t.

0 = 10 + (-0.5) t → 

0 = 10 -0.5 t → 0.5 t =10 → t= 20 s.

So the time taken is 20 seconds. So option A says "Time of motion: 20 s", which matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So initial velocity is 10 ft/s. Acceleration is -0.5 ft/s². So time to stop: t = (0 -10)/ (-0.5) = 20 s. Correct.

Looking at the options, option A is initial velocity 10 ft/s, time 20 s, which matches. So the answer is A.

But wait, let me think again. What if I made a mistake in calculating acceleration?

Alternative approach: The work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy.

Work done by friction: F_friction * distance = (0.5 lb) * 100 ft.

But wait, I need to convert lb to newtons. Because in the work formula, I'd better have everything in consistent units.

Wait, 1 lb is equal to approximately 4.44822 N. So 0.5 lb is 0.5 * 4.44822 ≈ 2.224 N.

So the work done by friction is 2.224 N * 100 ft.

But wait, 1 ft is approximately 0.3048 meters. So 100 ft is 100 * 0.3048 = 30.48 meters.

So work done by friction: force * distance in meters. So 2.224 N * 30.48 m ≈ 67.74 J.

The work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy. Initially, the stone has kinetic energy (1/2) m v0². After stopping, it has zero kinetic energy.

So 67.74 J = (1/2) *1 slug * v0².

Wait, but 1 slug is a unit of mass, kg is kg, but the unit of force is pound-force. So perhaps this approach is getting a bit complicated. Let me proceed.

So 67.74 = 0.5 * 1 * v0² → v0² = 67.74 * 2 = 135.48 → v0 = sqrt(135.48) ≈ 11.64 ft/s. Wait, this is about 11.64 ft/s. But earlier, using kinematic equation, I got 10 ft/s.

Hmm, discrepancy here. Why is that?

Wait, let's think about the units. The frictional force is 0.5 lb. In the work approach, I converted lb to newtons, but maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should have worked in imperial units, let me try that.

Wait, applying the work-energy principle:

The work done by friction (which is negative, since friction opposes motion) equals the change in kinetic energy.

Work = ΔKE = KE_final - KE_initial.

KE_initial = (1/2) m v0².

KE_final = 0.

So Work = - (1/2) m v0² = F_friction * s.

But wait, the work done by friction is F_friction * distance × cos(theta), where theta is the angle between force and displacement. Since friction acts opposite to displacement, theta is 180 degrees, cos(theta) is -1. So work done is F_friction * s * (-1).

So the work done is -F_friction * s.

Now, F_friction is 0.5 lb, but the units here are a problem because F is in lb and s is in ft. So I need to convert 0.5 lb into force in slugs ft/s², because F = ma, and m is in slugs. So 1 lb = 1 slug * 32 ft/s². So 0.5 lb = 0.5 lb = 0.5 lb = 0.5 lb. Wait, no, let's express 0.5 lb in terms of force.

Wait, since 1 lb = 1 slug * 32 ft/s², then 0.5 lb = 0.5 * 32 * slug * (ft/s²) → 0.5 *32 = 16 slug ft/s². So 0.5 lb =16 slug ft/s².

Wait, but force is mass times acceleration, so F = m a. So F is in lb (which is force) is equal to m (slug) times a (ft/s²). Because 1 slug is a unit of mass, and 1 ft/s² is the acceleration unit. So, 1 lb = 1 slug * 32 ft/s². So 0.5 lb is 0.5 slug * 32 ft/s² = 16 slug ft/s². So force is 16 slug ft/s².

Wait, but in the work equation, F is 0.5 lb, which is the same as 16 slug ft/s².

So the work done is W = F × d × cos(180 degrees) = - (0.5 lb) × 100 ft × 1 = -50 lb ft. But wait, the work done by friction is negative because it's opposing the direction. 

Work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy. The initial KE is (1/2) m v^2 = (1/2)(1 slug)(v0^2). The final KE is zero. So the change is - (1/2) v0².

So W = - (1/2) v0² = - (0.5 lb) × 100 ft.

Wait, but wait, the work done by friction is W = -50 lb ft. So:

- (1/2) v0² = -50 → (1/2) v0² = 50 → v0² = 100 → v0=10 ft/s. So initial velocity is 10 ft/s. Which matches the previous result.

So earlier, when I tried using the work-energy approach, I thought I got 11.64 ft/s, but that was probably a mistake because I messed up the unit conversion. So the correct initial velocity is 10 ft/s.

So the initial velocity is 10 ft/s, time is 20 s. So the answer is option A.

To determine the initial velocity and time taken for the curling stone, we analyze the problem using the principles of kinematics and the work-energy theorem.

### Key Information:
- Mass of the stone: \( m = 1 \, \text{slug} \)
- Frictional force: \( F_f = 0.5 \, \text{lb} \)
- Distance traveled: \( s = 100 \, \text{ft} \)
- Goal: Find the initial velocity \( u \) and the time \( t \) taken to stop.

### Step 1: Determine the acceleration
The frictional force is given by \( F_f = \mu m g \), where \( \mu \) is the coefficient of friction. However, since the frictional force is directly provided, we use Newton's second law:
\[
F_f = m a \implies a = \frac{F_f}{m} = \frac{0.5 \, \text{lb}}{1 \, \text{slug}} = 0.5 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]
Since the stone is slowing down, the acceleration is negative: \( a = -0.5 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \).

### Step 2: Use kinematic equation to find initial velocity
The stone comes to rest after traveling \( s = 100 \, \text{ft} \). Using the kinematic equation:
\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s
\]
where \( v = 0 \, \text{ft/s} \) (final velocity), \( a = -0.5 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), and \( s = 100 \, \text{ft} \):
\[
0 = u^2 + 2(-0.5)(100) \implies u^2 = 100 \implies u = 10 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time taken to stop
Using the kinematic equation:
\[
v = u + a t
\]
where \( v = 0 \, \text{ft/s} \), \( u = 10 \, \text{ft/s} \), and \( a = -0.5 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \):
\[
0 = 10 + (-0.5)t \implies t = \frac{10}{0.5} = 20 \, \text{s}
\]

### Verification Using Work-Energy Theorem
The work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy:
\[
W = F_f \cdot s = -0.5 \, \text{lb} \cdot 100 \, \text{ft} = -50 \, \text{lb-ft}
\]
The work done is also given by:
\[
W = \Delta KE = -\frac{1}{2} m u^2
\]
Substituting \( W = -50 \, \text{lb-ft} \), \( m = 1 \, \text{slug} \), and \( u = 10 \, \text{ft/s} \):
\[
-50 = -\frac{1}{2}(1)(10)^2 \implies -50 = -50
\]
This confirms the initial velocity is \( 10 \, \text{ft/s} \).

### Final Answer
- Initial velocity: \( 10 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Time of motion: \( 20 \, \text{s} \)
