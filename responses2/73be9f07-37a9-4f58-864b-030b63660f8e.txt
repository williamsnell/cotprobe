Okay, so I have this economics question here about price changes and demand. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a product with inelastic demand. I remember that inelastic demand means that when the price changes, the quantity demanded doesn't change much. So, it's not very responsive to price changes.

The question is asking which option best describes the situation after the price is raised. The options are A through J, each describing a different outcome. I think I need to remember what happens when demand is inelastic when the price increases.

First, let's recall what inelastic demand means. If demand is inelastic, the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. So, for example, if the price goes up by 10%, the quantity demanded might only decrease by 5%, or maybe even less.

When the price of a product increases, and demand is inelastic, the quantity demanded will decrease, but the revenue (which is price times quantity) might change. Because the quantity only decreases slightly, the total revenue might actually increase. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. If price goes up and quantity goes down, but the quantity decrease is less than the percentage price increase, then total revenue (price times quantity) increases. For example, if price goes from $10 to $11 (10% increase), and quantity goes down by 2% (so from 100 to 98 units), then total revenue before was $1000, now it's $1078, which is an increase.

So, if the price increases on an inelastic good, the total revenue would increase. So looking at the options, option I is "Total revenue will decrease." That's not right. Option H is "Total revenue will decrease." So that's incorrect. Option C is "Total revenue will increase," which is correct.

But wait, let me look at the options again. So the options are about what happens after the price is raised. So the correct response would be that total revenue increases.

So the options are:

A: Consumers will demand more. No, because inelastic demand, so quantity doesn't increase much.

B: Complementary goods' price increases. I don't think this is relevant here. Unless the product is a complement, but the question doesn't specify that. So probably not.

C: Total revenue increases. Correct, as inelastic demand would lead to higher total when price goes up.

D: Quantity decreases. Correct, because demand is inelastic, so Q will decrease.

E: Total revenue doesnâ€™t change. No, because inelastic demand, raising price leads to a rise in total revenue.

F: Quantity increases. No, because demand is inelastic. So quantity decreases.

G: Quantity drastically decreases. Maybe, but I think in reality, it's only a little bit. So "fractally" is too strong. Probably it's not that drastic.

H: Total revenue decreases. No, because it's increasing.

I think option C is correct. So the answer would be C: Total revenue will increase.

Wait, but let me check if any other options are correct. Let's see the other options. Option D says quantity decreases. That's correct. So both C and D are correct in a way. But I think the question is asking for the best description. Let me re-read the options.

The question is: "Which of the following best describes the situation after the price is raised on a product that has an inelastic demand?"

So the options are:

C: Total revenue will increase.

D: Quantity demanded will decrease.

Which is the best description? Both are correct, but the options are separate. So perhaps the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, the options are presented as separate choices, so which is the correct one.

Wait, the question is about "the situation after the price is raised." So after the price is raised, what happens.

In inelastic demand, when price goes up, quantity demanded goes down (so D is correct). And the total revenue (price * quantity) would go up because the quantity change is less than the price change.

So, option C says "Total revenue will increase." That's correct.

What about option E? It says total revenue doesn't change. No, because inelastic demand would cause total revenue to change. So E is incorrect.

Option H says total revenue decreases. No, that's incorrect.

So the correct answers would be C and D.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is asking which of the following best describes the situation. So both C and D are correct. But the options are single-answer.

Wait, let me think again. The options are A to J.

So, in the options, both C and D are correct, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

A:Consumers will demand more. No.

B: Complementary prices increase. No, unless it's about another factor, but the question doesn't mention anything about that.

C: Total revenue increase. Correct.

D: Quantity decreases. Correct.

E: No change. Incorrect.

F: Quantity increases. No.

G: Quantity drastically decreases. Probably not.

H: No change. Incorrect.

I: Revenue decreases. No.

J: Substitute prices decrease. No, unless the product is a substitute, but it's not specified.

So both C and D are correct, but in the options, only one can be selected.

Wait, but maybe the question is about what's the best description. So, which statement is the best.

C says total revenue increases. It's a correct statement. D says quantity decreases, which is also correct.

But the question is asking which best describes the situation after the price is raised. So, the best answer would be C or D.

Wait, let me think again. Let's get the definitions straight.

Price elasticity of demand is inelastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price.

So when price increases, quantity demanded decreases.

Price increase: 10% --> quantity decreases by 5% or less.

Total revenue (TR) = price * quantity.

So, if price increases by x% and quantity decreases by y% (y < x), then TR increases.

So, in this case, TR increases.

So option C is correct.

Thus, the correct answer should be option C: Total revenue will increase.

But looking at the options, option C is there, and option D as well.

Wait, but the options don't have 'Both C and D are correct,' but each option is a choice. So, in the question, only one option is correct. So, which is the best description.

Wait, the question is about 'the situation after the price is raised.' So, in this scenario, the correct answers are that TR increases and quantity decreases.

So the options are possibly both correct. But in the given options, only one is correct.

Wait, this is a multiple-choice question, so only one option is correct. So why are both C and D correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another way to think: in inelastic demand, the price change leads to a proportionally smaller quantity change. So, when you raise price, the quantity demanded goes down, but not as much as the price increase. So, TR increases.

Thus, the best answer is C: Total revenue will increase.

Wait, but the options are separate. So, looking at the options again, the correct answer is C and D are both correct statements.

But the question is about which 'best describes the situation.' So, both C and D are correct statements about the situation.

Wait, but in the options, each is a separate choice, so I can't choose both. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether the demand is elastic or inelastic, and not the revenue.

Wait, but the question states it's inelastic.

So, in this case, after raising price, quantity demanded decreases, TR increases. So, the correct options are C and D. But perhaps the question is only about what happens to TR, not the quantity.

Wait, but the question asks which best describes the situation. I think both C and D are correct, but perhaps the options are such that only one is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, the question is which best describes the situation. So, the correct answer is C and D. But the options are each a separate choice, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but perhaps the question is which of the following statements is correct. So, both C and D are correct, but perhaps the options don't include 'both C and D are correct.' So, perhaps the correct option is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken and in elastic demand, the opposite happens, but for inelastic, it's TR increases.

Wait, but the options are: the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the quantity. So perhaps the question is only about the quantity change, but the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the options are structured so that the correct answer is C. Because, for example, the best answer is C: 'total revenue will increase.'

But in reality, both statements are correct. However, the options are single choice, so the correct answer is C and D. But perhaps the question is testing for the quantity change as a result of the price change.

Wait, but the options don't have 'quantity decreases' as an option. Oh, no, option D is 'quantity demanded will decrease.'

So D is correct, and C is also correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options don't allow for that; each is a separate option. So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the situation after the price is raised. So, two things happen: quantity decreases and TR increases.

But the options are separate, and the question is which one is the best description.

So, both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the options are in a way that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the possible answers. So, when demand is inelastic, raising price causes TR to increase, and quantity demanded falls. So, the correct statement is that total revenue increases (option C) and quantity decreases (option D).

But the options are all separate, so the correct answer would be both C and D. But since the options are presented as single choices, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the quantity. So, the correct answer is D, and C is also correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach. The question is, 'which of the following best describes the situation after the price is raised?'

In an inelastic demand scenario, the quantity demanded will decrease, and because the demand is inelastic, the price increase will cause the total revenue to increase.

So both C (TR increases) and D (quantity decreases) are correct.

But in the options, each is a separate choice, so the correct answer must be one of them. Wait, perhaps the options are such that both C and D are correct, but perhaps the question is about the quantity change, and the options are given.

Wait, another way: the question is about 'best describes the situation.' So, both C and D are correct, but perhaps the answer is C because it's the only option that describes the change in TR.

Wait, but the question is about what happens 'after the price is raised.' Both changes (quantity and TR) occur, but each option is a separate statement.

So, perhaps the correct answers are both C and D, but in the options, I can only choose one. So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, as it directly describes the change in TR.

But let me think again. Let's take an example. Suppose you have a product with a price of $10, and quantity demanded is 100 units. So TR is 1000.

Suppose the price is raised by 10% to $11, and quantity demanded drops by 5% to 95 units. TR becomes 11 *95 = 1045, which is higher than before. So, TR increases.

So, in this case, option C is correct.

But what about option D? It says quantity demanded decreases. Which is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options are presented as separate choices, so perhaps the correct answer is both C and D, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the answer options again.

The options are A to J. So the question is about the best description. So, both C and D are correct. But looking back at the options, the correct answer must be either C or D. Since the question is about which best describes the situation, perhaps the best answer is C because it directly relates to the change in TR, which is a key aspect of this scenario.

Wait, but what about the options? C says TR increases, which is correct. D says quantity decreases, which is also correct.

So, both C and D are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer must include both. But since the options are single-choice, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D and C, but that's not the case. I think I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the question asks which best describes the situation after the price is raised. So, the only correct statements are C and D. But since the options are separate, perhaps the best answer is both, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the quantity change, so D is correct, and C is also correct.

Wait, but given that, I think the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question asks which option best describes the situation after the price is raised on a product with inelastic demand. In this scenario, the quantity demanded will decrease (option D is correct), and the total revenue (TR) will increase because the decrease in quantity demanded is less than the percentage increase in price (option C is correct). However, the question is about the best description of the situation, and both C and D are correct. Since the options are separate, the best answer is likely C, as it directly addresses the change in total revenue, which is a key aspect of the scenario.
