Question:

Marx prided himself on his 'scientific' analysis of capital-ism. Through this analysis, he felt he had proved how the problemsfacing the nineteenth century were intimately re-latedto the capitalist mode of production. Modern radical economistshold the similar view that the problems of modernWestern society are inherent in capitalist production. Give the orthodox rebuttal to this viewpoint.

Options:

A: Elimination of capitalism can resolve all societal problems.
B: Many non-capitalist societies suffer from the same problems as Western, capitalist countries.
C: The capitalist mode of production is the only system that has consistently reduced poverty worldwide.
D: Problems in Western society are solely due to individual moral failures, not the economic system.
E: Capitalism naturally corrects any societal problems through market forces without the need for intervention.
F: Non-Western capitalist societies do not encounter any social or economic problems.
G: Capitalism is the sole cause of problems in modern Western society.
H: The problems of modern Western society are a result of technological advancement, not the capitalist production mode.
I: Only capitalist societies face issues such as exploitation, pollution, and economic inequality.
J: Capitalist societies have the best track record for solving social and economic problems.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Marx and his scientific analysis of capitalism. Let me read it again.

Marx praised his scientific approach to capitalism and used it to argue that the problems of the 19th century are tied to capitalist production. Then, radical economists agree that the same issues in today's Western societies are inherent in capitalist production. The question asks for the "orthodox rebuttal" to this viewpoint.

So, the options are A through J. I need to think about what Marx really thought, and what the radical economists might counter. Marx's idea was that capitalism's problems, like exploitation, class struggle, inequality, and so on, are deeply connected to the economic system. So, the radical economists are claiming that the problems in today's Western societies are the same as those in the past.

An orthodox rebuttal would likely argue that Marx's view was too absolute. Marx's analysis was based on his time, not just the West. He might have thought that capitalist practices led to certain types of inequalities and exploitation, but maybe he didn't realize that other societies, non-Western, might also face similar issues.

Looking at the options, let's evaluate each.

Option A: Elimination of capitalism can resolve all societal problems. Hmm, that's a possible rebuttal, but I'm not sure if it's the most orthodox. It's more of an economic argument, not necessarily directly addressing Marx's scientific approach.

Option B: Many non-capitalist societies suffer from the same problems as Western, capitalist countries. This seems like a strong rebuttal. It directly challenges the idea that capitalist systems inherently cause the same problems. It's pointing out that even if a society isn't capitalist, it might still face similar issues, so Marx's analysis isn't entirely universal.

Option C: The capitalist mode of production is the only system that has consistently reduced poverty worldwide. Wait, that's more of an anti-Marxist statement. It suggests that capitalism is the only way to reduce poverty, which might not be a proper rebut. It's more of a negative stance, not directly refuting the idea that capitalism's problems are tied to the system itself.

Option D: Problems in Western society are solely due to individual moral failures, not the economic system. That's a statement about causation, rather than directly addressing the critique that the problem is due to the system. It doesn't refute the idea that the system is part of the problem.

Option E: Capitalism naturally corrects any societal problems through market forces without the need for intervention. This is more of a positive statement about capitalism's efficiency. It doesn't directly address the critique that the problems are caused by the system.

Option F: Non-Western capitalist societies do not encounter any social or economic problems. That's a strong negative statement. It directly contradicts the idea that capitalist systems are inherently problematic. It's a strong rebut.

Option G: Capitalism is the sole cause of problems in modern Western society. This is similar to option D, focusing on causation. It doesn't directly counter the cause-effect argument.

Option H: The problems of modern Western society are a result of technological advancement, not the capitalist production mode. This is about the cause, not the analysis. It's more of an argument about the root cause, not the analysis.

Option I: Only capitalist societies face issues such as exploitation, pollution, and economic inequality. This is a strong statement, but it's a bit too narrow. It suggests that only capitalist societies have these problems, which is not necessarily true. It's more of an absolute claim about the nature of capitalism.

Option J: Capitalist societies have the best track record for solving social and economic problems. This is a positive statement about the effectiveness of capitalism. It doesn't address the critique that there are other issues rooted in capitalist systems.

So, the best options are B and F. Let me think again.

The question is about the "orthodox rebuttal." The problem is that Marx's scientific analysis showed that capitalist systems have inherent problems, such as exploitation. The radical economists' view is that the same issues in Western societies, which are capitalist, are real.

The traditional (orthodox) response to Marx's work is to argue that his analysis was based on historical conditions and not necessarily universally applicable. So, Marx's view isn't absolute but rather shows that the same kinds of problems exist in different contexts.

Option B says many non-capitalist societies suffer the same problems. That's a strong denial of the idea that capitalism is the only cause. It's a direct refutation.

Option F says non-Western capitalist societies don't have problems. That's a stronger statement. It's saying that capitalist societies in other parts of the world aren't facing the same issues, which directly contradicts the idea that capitalism is inherently bad.

So, both B and F are correct in their own ways, but the question is looking for the correct answer.

Wait, the options are exclusive, so which one is the best.

Marx's analysis was that capitalism leads to specific problems, like exploitation. The radical economists say that the same problems exist in other capitalist systems. The traditional response is to say that Marx's view is not universal. So, the argument is that it's not that all capitalist societies have these problems, but that they have similar problems.

Looking for the 'orthodox' rebuttal, which is the most direct.

Option B says many non-capitalist societies suffer the same problems as Western. That's a direct attack on the idea that capitalism is the main cause of the problems.

Option F is even stronger, saying non-Western capitalist societies don't face these issues. So, both B and F are correct, but F is a more direct denial of the idea that capitalism causes the issues.

Wait, but the question is about the 'orthodox' rebut. The 'orthodox' would be the more direct and widely accepted response. So, perhaps F is a stronger statement.

Wait, another angle: The original question says that Marx's view was that the 19th-century problems are due to capitalism. The radical economists agree that same issues exist in modern Western societies. The traditional rebut is that Marx's analysis was only applicable to Western societies and not to others.

So, the argument is that his view is too narrow. So, the traditional answer is that the capitalist mode is not the only cause. So, the 'orthodox' rebut is that his analysis was too narrow.

Which of the options reflects that.

Option B is a strong denial, but option F is a more direct denial.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Because the question is about the 'orthodox' rebut, which is the traditional response. The traditional response is that Marx's analysis was only applicable to Western societies and not others.

So, the correct answer is B: Many non-capitalist societies suffer from the same problems. That's a direct refutation.

The question asks for the orthodox rebuttal to the view that Marx's scientific analysis of capitalism revealed how 19th-century problems are tied to capitalist systems, and that modern Western societies face similar issues. The traditional response to Marx's work is that his analysis was too narrow, only applicable to Western societies and not others.

**Option B** is a strong and direct rebut. It asserts that many non-capitalist societies suffer from the same problems as Western capitalist countries, directly contradicting the idea that capitalism is the sole cause of these issues. This aligns with the traditional view that Marx's analysis was too narrow and only applicable to Western societies.

**Option F** is also a strong rebut, but it is a stronger statement. It claims that non-Western capitalist societies do not encounter social or economic problems, directly denying the idea that capitalist systems in other parts of the world are facing the same challenges. This is a more direct denial of the universal nature of capitalism's problems.

Between the two, **Option B** is the more traditional and widely accepted rebut, as it reflects the broader context and denial of the universality of capitalism's inherent problems. It is the most direct and widely accepted answer.

**Answer: B**
