Question:

Explain the development of an individual who is not psychologically well-adjusted, according to Rogers.

Options:

A: Rogers posits that consistent positive reinforcement leads to maladjustment as it prevents the development of a realistic self-concept.
B: Rogers believes that personal evaluations by others, especially during childhood, result in a distancing or incongruence between the experiences of the self and the experiences of the organism, leading to psychological maladjustment.
C: According to Rogers, the primary factor in psychological maladjustment is the individual's failure to achieve their full economic potential.
D: Rogers suggests that well-adjustment is hindered when an individual adopts the values of others as their own without question.
E: Rogers believes that evaluations by others have no impact on a child's psychological adjustment
F: Rogers believes that a lack of discipline and structure in childhood is the main contributor to psychological maladjustment.
G: Rogers asserts that psychological maladjustment arises primarily from an individual's inability to engage in abstract thinking.
H: Rogers believes that psychological well-being is determined solely by genetic factors, with environmental factors playing no role.
I: Rogers believes that the child's self-concept is always in congruence with the experiences of the organism
J: Rogers believes that the child's self-regard is always conditional

Okay, so I've got this question about the development of an individual according to James R. Rogers' theory. Hmm, I remember Rogers' theory of psychological well-being, so I should think about that.

The question asks about the development of a person who isn't well-adjusted. The options are A to J, each making a different claim. I'll need to go through each option and see which one fits with what I know about Rogers.

Rogers thought that psychological adjustment is influenced by several factors, including reinforcement, disengagement, and the role of the self. He talked about the self-concept being crucial. So, let's look at each option.

Option A: Positive reinforcement leads to maladjustment because it prevents a realistic self-concept. Wait, I thought positive reinforcement works by reinforcing behaviors that lead to positive outcomes, helping the self-actualization. If it prevents a realistic self, maybe that's not right. Also, I think Rogers said that reinforcement can either enhance or diminish maladjustment. Not sure if this specifically points to maladjustment.

Option B: Personal evaluations by others cause incongruence between self and organism. That rings a bell. Rogers said that when people evaluate the self, especially during childhood, their evaluations can make the self and the organism seem different. This might lead to maladjustment because the self thinks it's experiencing different things than it's really experiencing.

Option C: Failures in economic potential lead to maladjustment. I'm not sure about that. Rogers thought that a person's potential is more about individual ability and personality, not just economic factors. So maybe this isn't correct.

Option D: Adherence to others' values causes maladjustment. I don't remember Rogers specifically saying this. His main focus was on self-concept and how it needs to align with experiences, not just values.

Option E: Evaluations by others have no impact. That doesn't sound right. I remember something about evaluations playing a role, especially in development.

Option F: Lack of discipline causing maladjustment. I'm not sure about this. Rogers didn't focus on discipline; he was more about self-concept.

Option G: Ability to engage in abstract thinking is a cause. I'm not sure if that's part of his model. His model was more about self-concept and reinforcement.

Option H: Genetic vs environment. I think Rogers thought that environment contributed a lot, not just genetic factors. He believed that environment is the primary factor.

Option I: Self-concept congruent with organism's experiences. I think this is correct. Rogers suggested that a healthy self-concept should match what the person is experiencing.

Option J: Self-regard is conditional. I'm not sure about this. I think self-regard is more about how one's self-perception is formed, not necessarily being conditional.

So, putting it together: Option B seems to fit. Rogers believed that personal evaluations (like from others) cause a disconnect between the self and the actual experiences, leading to psychological maladjustment. The self doesn't really match what it's experiencing.

The correct answer is **B**: Rogers believed that personal evaluations by others, especially during childhood, result in a distancing or incongruence between the experiences of the self and the organism, leading to psychological maladjustment.

**Answer: B**
