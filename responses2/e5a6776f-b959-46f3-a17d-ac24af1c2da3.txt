Okay, so I have this question about a logical fallacy, and I need to figure out which one it is. The question says that someone responds to an argument with a sarcastic statement like, "Yeah, right. Like that's ever going to happen." And I have to choose the fallacy that this person committed.

Hmm, I remember that fallacies are errors in reasoning, so I need to think about what kind of fallacy this sarcastic statement fits into. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Tu quoque. That's a defense of the argument from a single counterexample. Like, "You must accept it because I said so, and the rest isn't relevant." I don't think that's what this statement is about.

Option B: Appeal to ignorance. That's when someone says because the other side doesn't know something, so you can just assume it's wrong. The sarcastic statement here is more about agreement rather than ignoring someone's lack of knowledge.

Option C: Argumentum ad populum. This is when someone assumes that because a large number of people believe something, it must be true. The sarcastic statement doesn't seem to be about the popularity of a proposition.

Option D: False cause. That's when someone assumes that one event caused another, without proper evidence. The sarcastic response here doesn't indicate any cause and effect.

Option E: Appeal to indignation. That's when someone uses the person's discomfort or indignation to argue for their point. The statement doesn't mention anything about discomfort or discomfort being the reason.

Option F: Appeal to spite. This is when someone uses someone else's lack of knowledge or the difficulty of convincing them to believe something. It's about using the audience's attitude to make a point. The sarcastic statement here doesn't necessarily involve the audience's attitude.

Option G: Horse laugh. That's when someone uses a humorous or exaggerated response to imply that their opponent is being too serious. This fits because the sarcastic statement is playful and implying that the opponent is being too firm.

Option H: slippery slope. This is a situation where each step is taken to lead to a bad outcome. The statement doesn't seem to be about a chain reaction; it's just a single, light-hearted response.

Option I: straw man fallacy. This is when someone Argues for a weak case by presenting a stronger, irrelevant argument. The sarcastic response here doesn't present a weaker case; instead, it supports the original argument directly.

Option J: Argumentum ad hominem. This is when someone attacks the person's character rather than the argument. The sarcastic statement doesn't attack the character of the person; it's a response to the argument itself.

So, putting it all together, the sarcastic statement here is about supporting the original argument by agreeing with it, which doesn't fit straw man (I) or argumentum ad hominem (J). It's more about a light-hearted, sometimes humorous, response rather than attacking the person's character or presenting an irrelevant argument. So, that points to option G, horse laugh.

The sarcastic statement "Yeah, right. Like that's ever going to happen" is best explained by the fallacy of **argumentum ad populum** (G), but wait, that doesn't fit. Let me reevaluate. The correct fallacy here is **horse laugh** (G), as it uses humor to imply that the opponent is being too firm. 

Answer: G
