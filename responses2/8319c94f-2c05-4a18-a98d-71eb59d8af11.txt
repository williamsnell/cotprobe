Okay, so I have this question about finding the capacitance of a single isolated conducting sphere with radius 'a'. Hmm, I remember that capacitance is related to the ability of a conductor to hold electric charge. I think the formula involves the permittivity of free space, which is ε₀.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, for a spherical conductor, the capacitance is C = 4πε₀a. Oh wait, no, wait a second. No, wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confused. Because I think the formula is C = (4πε₀ a )? Or is it something else. Let me think. 

I recall that the capacitance of a sphere is given by C = 4πε₀ a. So the formula is C equals 4 pi times epsilon zero times the radius. That makes sense because the bigger the sphere, the higher the capacitance. So for a radius a, it's 4 pi epsilon zero a.

Looking at the options, option I says C = 4πε₀a. So that would be the correct answer.

The capacitance of a single isolated conducting sphere of radius \( a \) is given by the formula \( C = 4\pi\epsilon_0 a \). This formula arises because a conducting sphere behaves like a parallel plate capacitor with both plates being the same size, leading to a capacitance proportional to the radius of the sphere. 

Among the provided options, the correct expression is:

**A: \( C = \pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**B: \( C = 10\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**C: \( C = 2\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**D: \( C = 12\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**E: \( C = 6\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**F: \( C = 3\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**G: \( C = 7\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**H: \( C = 8\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**I: \( C = 4\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

**J: \( C = 5\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**

The correct answer is **I: \( C = 4\pi\epsilon_0 a \)**.
