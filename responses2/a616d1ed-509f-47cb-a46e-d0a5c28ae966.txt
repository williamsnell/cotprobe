Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Carruther's views on why moral criticism applies to animals. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in biology, especially ethology, people often talk about behaviors and their underlying reasons. Like, why do certain animals behave a certain way. I think there's a theory about intrinsic motivation. So, maybe it's about the animal's internal drive or reason behind their actions.

Carruther's work I think is related to ethology. Oh wait, I've heard he discussed how behaviors are explained by the animal's own nature. So, for example, if a bird builds a nest, it's because of the nest's function, not just a social need. So, the justification for moral criticism would be about the animal's intrinsic reasons, not external factors like our actions.

Looking at the options, option F says "the bad qualities of character that our actions evince." That sounds more like something we might think is about our own actions and whether they contribute to harmful behavior. But I think it's about the animal's own reasons, not ours.

So, another option is B: the animal's direct moral standing. Direct moral standing would imply that the animal's character is its own moral worth. But I'm not sure if that's the same as the animal's inherent reason for doing certain things.

Option C is societal norms and expectations. Well, humans do have social norms, but the question is about animals. So, maybe it's a factor, but I think the focus is on the animal's own behavior.

Option E: the animal's inability to defend itself. That's about self-defense, which is more about safety, not moral justification. So probably not relevant here.

Option D: the animal's role in the ecosystem. So, if an animal contributes to the ecosystem, that could influence its behavior, but not directly about the moral justification of its actions.

Wait, the question is about the justification for moral criticism. So, it's about why certain actions or behaviors are considered wrong. So, it's about the animal's reason for the action, not just our actions.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer should be B: the animal's direct moral standing. Because it's about the animal's inherent moral reasons, not our own actions.

The correct answer is B: the animal's direct moral standing. This refers to the animal's inherent reasons for its behaviors, distinguishing it from our actions which are not directly about the animal's moral justification. 

Answer: B
