Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Federal Reserve actions and how they affect the money supply. I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking which list contains only Fed actions that will increase the money supply. The options are A through H, each listing three actions. I remember that the money supply is influenced by the reserve requirements and the discount rate, among other factors. Also, buying and selling bonds are important for monetary policy.

Let me break it down. The main Fed tools for money creation are the discount rate and reserve requirements. When the Fed lowers the discount rate, it makes borrowing cheaper, which encourages people to borrow more, increasing the money supply. Similarly, lowering reserve requirements makes it easier for banks to lend, which also increases the money supply because banks can create more money by lending out more and holding less in reserves.

On the flip side, when the Fed raises the discount rate, it makes borrowing more expensive, so people and businesses are less likely to borrow, which should reduce the money supply. Raising reserve requirements would do the oppositeâ€”make it harder for banks to lend, so money supply decreases.

Now, buying bonds by the Fed would increase the money supply because it injects money into the economy. Selling bonds would reduce the money supply because it takes money out of the economy.

The question is about which options only have actions that increase the money supply. Let's look at each option:

Option A: Lower reserve requirements; lower discount rate; buy bonds. All three actions increase money supply. So this is a possible correct answer.

Option B: Lower reserve; lower discount; sell bonds. Sell bonds reduces the money supply. So this list includes an action that decreases money supply. So B is incorrect because it includes an action that decreases it.

Option C: Raise reserve; lower discount; buy bonds. Buy bonds increase money. Raise reserve would decrease money. Lower discount increases. So this mix includes a decrease. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Raise reserve; raise discount; sell bonds. Both increases in reserves and discount rates decrease money. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Lower reserve; raise discount; buy bonds. Lower reserve increases, raise discount decreases, buy bonds increases. So this list has some decreases. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Lower reserve; raise discount; sell bonds. Lower reserve increases, raise discount decreases, sell bonds decreases. So the list includes a decrease, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Raise reserve; lower discount; sell bonds. Raise reserve decreases, lower discount increases, sell bonds decreases. So this list has two decreases. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Raise reserve; lower discount; sell bonds. All three actions: raise reserve decreases, lower discount increases, sell bonds decreases. So this list has two decreases. So H is incorrect.

Wait, I just realized. Let me check again. The question is which option has only actions that increase the money supply. So any option that doesn't include any decrease actions would be correct.

Looking again:

Option A: All three actions increase. So A is a candidate.

Option B: Includes sell bonds, which decreases. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Raise reserve (decrease), lower discount (increase), buy bonds (increase). So one decrease. So C is wrong.

Option E: Lower reserve (increase), raise discount (decrease), buy bonds (increase). So one decrease. So E is wrong.

Option F: Lower reserve (increase), raise discount (decrease), sell bonds (decrease). So multiple decreases. So F is wrong.

Option G: Raise reserve (decrease), lower discount (increase), sell bonds (decrease). Two decreases. So G is wrong.

Option H: Raise reserve (decrease), lower discount (increase), sell bonds (decrease). Again, two decreases. So H is wrong.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait another approach: For the money supply to increase, the Fed needs to take actions that either lower reserve requirements, lower the discount rate, or buy bonds, but not raise reserve requirements, raise the discount rate, or sell bonds.

Wait, but in option A, all three actions increase the money supply. So A is correct.

Wait, but the question is which list is correct. So I need to identify which option includes only actions that increase the money supply.

Wait, let me go through each option again, because I might have miscounted.

Option A: Lower reserve requirements (yes, increases); lower discount rate (yes, increases); buy bonds (yes, increases). So all three actions in A increase the money supply. So this is correct.

Option B: Same as A except the third action is sell bonds. Sell bonds reduces money supply. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Raise reserve (no, that's bad), lower discount (yes), buy bonds (yes). So two actions decrease. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Both reserve and discount rates are raised, so both decrease. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Lower reserve (yes), raise discount (no), buy bonds (yes). So two actions: one correct, one incorrect. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Lower reserve (yes), raise discount (no), sell bonds (no). So only one correct. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Both reserve and discount rates are raised (nope), and sell bonds (no). So all are bad. Incorrect.

Option H: Reserve raised (nope), discount lowered (yes), sell bonds (no). So two nope actions. Incorrect.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when you lower the discount rate, it's a tool that increases money supply. Similarly, lowering reserve requirements increases the money supply. But when you raise reserve requirements, it's a bad move. Similarly, raising the discount rate is bad. But when you buy bonds, that is a good move.

So looking at the options, the correct one must only have actions that increase the money supply.

Option A: All three actions are correct.

Option E: Lower reserve (correct), raise discount (incorrect), buy bonds (correct). So that's two correct and one incorrect. But the question is about actions that increase the money supply. So E includes an incorrect action, so E is wrong.

Wait, but what about option F: Lower reserve (correct), raise discount (incorrect), sell bonds (incorrect). So only one correct. So F is incorrect because it includes two incorrect actions.

So the only option where all three actions are correct is option A. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine which options list only actions that increase the money supply, we analyze each option based on how the Federal Reserve's tools influence the money supply. The key tools are the discount rate and reserve requirements. Lowering the discount rate and lowering reserve requirements both increase the money supply, while raising these rates or selling bonds decrease it. Buying bonds is the correct tool for increasing the money supply.

- **Option A:** Lower reserve requirements (increase), lower the discount rate (increase), buy bonds (increase). All actions increase the money supply. **Correct.**
- **Option B:** Includes selling bonds (decrease). **Incorrect.**
- **Option C:** Includes raising reserve requirements (decrease). **Incorrect.**
- **Option D:** Includes raising the discount rate (decrease). **Incorrect.**
- **Option E:** Includes raising the discount rate (decrease). **Incorrect.**
- **Option F:** Includes selling bonds (decrease). **Incorrect.**
- **Option G:** Includes raising reserve requirements (decrease). **Incorrect.**
- **Option H:** Includes raising the discount rate (decrease). **Incorrect.**

Only **Option A** includes actions that increase the money supply.
