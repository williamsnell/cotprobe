Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about stakeholder theories. The question is asking what the three differing types of stakeholder theory are according to Donaldson and Preston (1995), and the options are A to J with various combinations.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that there are different theories about stakeholders. I think the main ones are about how stakeholders are defined and assessed. I've heard terms like normative, descriptive, and instrumental theories. But wait, maybe I should think more carefully.

I recall that Donaldson and Preston have written about this. I think the three main types are based on how stakeholders are viewed. Oh right, the three types are: 

1. **Normative Theory**: This focuses on what stakeholders should be. It's more about the ideal characteristics of stakeholders. Like, stakeholders should be individuals who can contribute to the organization's success, not just any group. So, this would be based on rules or principles that guide stakeholders.

2. **Descriptive Theory**: This is about how stakeholders are actually perceived and assessed. It's more factual, like the actual behavior of stakeholders. It describes the behavior or characteristics observed in reality.

3. **Instrumental Theory**: This is an applied approach, where stakeholders should behave in a certain way so that the organization can achieve its objectives. It's more about the actions or norms that should be followed.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What's the correct order or combination of these terms? The options are different groupings. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Normative, Political, Economic. Hmm, that doesn't ring a bell. I don't think political or economic are part of the standard theory types I remember.

Option B: Political, Descriptive, Economic. Again, political and economic might be related to specific theories, I don't think this is the standard.

Option C: Normative, Moral, Instrumental. No, I don't think moral is part of the standard stakeholder theories. I think the main theories are normative and descriptive, but I might be mixing up concepts here.

Option D: Normative, Descriptive, Political. Oh, wait, I think the third one might be the instrumental approach, not the political. So this might be incorrect.

Option E: Normative, Moral, Economic. Again, moral isn't a standard term here.

Option F: Normative, Instrumental, Economic. No, because economic is a component of the operational theory, perhaps. Or maybe economic theory is part of the normative.

Option G: Moral, Descriptive, Instrumental. No, as I thought before, moral is not a standard type.

Option H: Normative, Descriptive, Instrumental. That sounds familiar. Let me think. Oh yeah, I think that's it. Because Donaldson and Preston (1995) probably classified stakeholders into these three types.

Option I: Political, Descriptive, Instrumental. That's not right; political is more about structure or hierarchy, not a theory type.

Option J: Normative, Descriptive, Economic. But economic is part of the operational or instrumental approach, not the standard descriptor.

Wait, but I should make sure. I remember that the three main types are normative, descriptive, and instrumental. So the correct option should match that.

Looking back, option H says "Normative, Descriptive and Instrumental." That's exactly what I thought. So H is the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is H: **Normative, Descriptive and Instrumental**.

**Explanation:**
Donaldson and Preston (1995) outlined three main types of stakeholder theory: **Normative**, **Descriptive**, and **Instrumental**. These theories differ in their focus and approach:
- **Normative Theory** emphasizes what stakeholders should be, focusing on ideal characteristics.
- **Descriptive Theory** looks at how stakeholders are perceived and assessed in reality.
- **Instrumental Theory** applies behavioral or normative insights to guide stakeholders' actions for organizational success.

Option H correctly captures these three types of stakeholder theory.

Answer: H
