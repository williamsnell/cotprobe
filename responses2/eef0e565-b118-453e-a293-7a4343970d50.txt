Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about immunization and contraindications for Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DtaP). Let's break it down.

The question is asking what the parents should be questioned about when determining if there are contraindications for the DtaP immunization. The options are A to H, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that DtaP is the immunization for diphtheria, which is a bacterial infection. I think that immunizations are usually given to children before they have a certain age, but there are specific guidelines. I'm trying to recall if there are any contraindications for DtaP.

I remember that DtaP is given to prevent接种 with Diphthera, which is a bacterial infection. But wait, I think that DtaP is only given to individuals who are under a specific age. The recommended age is 2 months. That's because Diphthera is a severe and life-threatening infection, and giving it to a child until they're older than 2 months might lead to complications or prevent the necessary vaccines from being administered.

So, for immunization, especially DtaP, the parents should probably be questioned about the child's age. Because if the child is older than 2 months, that's when DtaP is recommended. If the child is older, DtaP isn't recommended. 

Looking at the options, option D is gestational age at birth. That's exactly the age they're asking about. So the parents should be questioned about their child's gestational age. 

Other options: A is allergy to eggs. Those are common but not specific to immunization contraindications for DtaP. B is previous seizures; that's about the child's medical history, not immunization. C is dietary habits, which aren't directly relevant. F is family history of diabetes—no, that's unrelated. G is history of heart disease; again, unrelated. H is heart disease; not relevant here. E is diabetes, same reason. 

So the right answer is D: gestational age at birth because that's the key age determining whether DtaP is recommended.

The parents should be questioned about the child's **gestational age at birth** to determine if DtaP immunization is contraindicated. This is because DtaP is recommended only for children under 2 months of age. 

Answer: D
