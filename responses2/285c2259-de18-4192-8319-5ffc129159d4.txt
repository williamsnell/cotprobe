Okay, so I've got this problem here where Molly got a haircut for $25 and left a 15% tip. I need to find out what her final cost was. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, the question is straightforward: calculate the total cost including the tip. So, the original cost is $25, and then a 15% tip is added. I remember that to calculate a percentage tip, I can convert the percentage to its decimal form and multiply it by the original amount.

So, 15% is the same as 0.15 in decimal. Multiplying that by $25 would give the tip amount. Let me do that math: 0.15 * 25. Let me think, 0.1 times 25 is 2.5, and 0.05 times 25 is 1.25. Adding those together, 2.5 + 1.25 equals 3.75. So, the tip is $3.75.

Now, to find the total cost, I add the original amount plus the tip. That's $25 + $3.75. Let me add those together. $25 plus $3 is $28, and then plus another 50 cents is $28.50. So the total should be $28.50.

Looking at the options provided, option J is $28.50. So that must be the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Original price: $25. Tip is 15%: 0.15*25=3.75. Total: 25+3.75=28.50. Yep, that looks right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So the correct choice is J.

The final cost includes the $25 haircut and a 15% tip. Calculating the tip: 0.15 * 25 = $3.75. Adding to the original price: $25 + $3.75 = $28.50. The correct answer is J.

Answer:
\boxed{J}
