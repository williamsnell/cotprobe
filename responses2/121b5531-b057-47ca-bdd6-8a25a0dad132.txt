Okay, so I've got this problem about a concave shaving mirror. Hmm, concave mirrors are converging mirrors, right? They have a focal length, and they form images based on whether the object is inside or outside the focal point. Wait, the question says it's a concave mirror, so it's a converging mirror, which means it's a positive focal length. Oh wait wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the focal length is 20 inches. Oh wait, wait, no, the focal length is the radius of curvature divided by two, but for a concave mirror, it's actually negative. Oh wait, but in the formula, I think the sign is important. So wait, the focal length for a concave mirror is positive, I think. Because the mirror is converging. So if it's a concave mirror, the focal length is positive. But wait, the problem says the focal length is 20 inches. So for a concave mirror, the focal length is positive. So that's something to keep in mind.

The question asks how far the mirror should be held from the man's face to get an image of two-fold magnification. So the magnification is -2. Wait, because magnification is negative for mirrors. So the image is virtual and upright, but wait, the magnification being -2 indicates a virtual image? Wait, no, wait. The magnification formula is m = -di/do. So if m is negative, that means the image is inverted. But for a concave mirror, the image can be real or virtual. Since it's a concave mirror, if the object is inside the focal point, the image is virtual and upright, but if the object is outside, the image is real and inverted. Wait a minute, but the question is about a two-fold magnification. So the magnification is -2, so the image is virtual and upright?

Wait, but wait, for a concave mirror, if the object is inside the focal point, the image is virtual and upright. If the object is outside, the image is real and inverted. Because when the object is inside the focal length, the image is on the same side as the object (virtual) and upright. So the magnification is negative. But the question is about a two-fold magnification. So perhaps the image is virtual, upright, and magnified by a factor of two.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, the magnification is the image height over the object height, and the sign depends on whether it's upright or inverted. So if m is -2, that means the image is inverted relative to the object. But wait, for a concave mirror, if the object is inside the focal point, the image is virtual and upright. So I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the magnification formula is m = -di/do. So when m is positive, the image is upright, negative is inverted. So if the magnification is -2, that's a virtual, upright image. So that suggests that the object is located beyond the focal point, because when the object is beyond the focal point, the image is real and inverted. Wait, but then why is the magnification positive? Hmm, no, wait, no. Because when the object is beyond the focal point, the mirror produces a real image, but the image is inverted. So the magnification would be negative. Wait, but the question says the magnification is two-fold. Wait, but the two-fold is a magnification, so positive. But that would imply that the image is upright, not inverted. So that would mean that the image is virtual and upright, which would occur if the object is within the focal point. Because when the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual and upright.

Wait, so the magnification being -2 would indicate a virtual, upright image, which is possible only when the object is within the focal length. But wait, for a concave mirror, the focal length is where the object is located at the focal point, the image is at infinity. So when the object is between the focal point and the mirror, the image is in front of the mirror, virtual, upright, and magnified. So the magnification here would be positive two, but wait, the formula m = -di/do. So if m is positive, then di is negative. Because di is the image distance. So di is negative in a virtual image. So m = - di/do. Let's say m is 2. Then 2 = - di/do. So di = -2 do. So the image is behind the mirror, and its distance is twice as far as the object, but negative because it's a virtual image.

Wait, that makes sense. So the object is at a distance do, and the image is at a distance di, which is -2 do. Because the magnification is -2, so m = -2 = - di/do. So solving for di, we get di = 2 do. So the image is twice as far as the object, but in the same direction (since di is negative, the image is on the opposite side of the mirror from the object).

So, the formula for mirrors is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Since it's a concave mirror, f is positive. So substituting di = 2 do: 1/f = 1/do + 1/(2 do) = (2 + 1) / (2 do) = 3/(2 do). So 1/f = 3/(2 do) → do = (3 f) / 2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I think I might have gotten the formula wrong. Another approach: using the mirror equation, 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Since di is 2 do, substitute that in: 1/f = 1/do + 1/(2 do) → which is (2 + 1)/(2 do) → 3/(2 do). So 1/f = 3/(2 do) → do = (3 f) / 2. But wait, f is the focal length, which is 20 inches. So do = (3 *20)/2 = (60)/2 = 30 inches. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 30. Oh wait, looking back, the options are A: 8, B:25, C:10, D:40, E:5, F:12, G:30, H:35, I:15, J:20.

So 30 inches is option G. But wait, wait, I thought for a concave mirror, if the object is inside the focal length, the image is virtual and upright, and magnified. So the magnification is positive and greater than 1. So 2-fold magnification would fit this scenario. So does that mean the correct answer is 30 inches? Option G.

But wait, let me double-check. So if the image is two-fold magnified, then m = 2. So m = -di/do = 2 → di = -2 do. Because m is positive 2, the image is upright, virtual. So di is negative, do is positive. So using mirror formula: 1/f =1/do + 1/di → 1/20 = 1/do + 1/(-2 do) → 1/20 = (1 - 1/2)/do → 1/20 = (1/2)/do → 1/20 = (do)/2 → do = 2 * 20 / 1 → do = 40 inches. Wait, that's different from earlier. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting results now.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me go through it again.

So, using m = -di/do. We have m = 2. So 2 = - di/do → di = - 2 do.

Substitute into the mirror equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/20 = 1/do + 1/(-2 do) → 1/20 = (1 - 1/2) / do → 1/20 = (1/2)/do → multiply both sides by do → do/20 = 1/2 → do = 20 * (1/2) = 10 inches? No, wait: 1/20 = (1/2)/do → 1/20 = (do)/2 → do = 2 * (1/20) → do = 1/10? That can't be. Wait, maybe I'm getting the algebra wrong.

Wait, let's do it again. So 1/20 = (1/do) + (1/di). And di = -2 do. So substituting:

1/20 = (1/do) + (1/(-2 do)) → 1/20 = (1 - 1/2)/do → 1/20 = (1/2)/do → solving for do: do = (1/2) *20 → do=10 inches.

Wait, so that suggests the object is 10 inches in front of the mirror. But earlier I thought for a magnification of two, the object was 30 inches. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between m and whether the image is real or virtual. Let me clarify.

Wait, another approach: the magnification formula is m = hi/ho = - di/ do. So m = 2 → 2 = - di/ do → di = -2 do. But the image distance di is negative because it's a virtual image. So di = -2 do.

Substituting into mirror equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/20 = 1/do + 1/(-2 do) → 1/20 = (1 - 1/2 ) / do → 1/20 = (1/2)/do → 1/20 = 1/(2 do) → 2 do =20 → do =10 inches.

Wait, so the object should be 10 inches from the mirror. But wait, according to the options, option C is 10 inches. So why the confusion earlier?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier assumption. Because in the first approach, I thought when the object is inside the focal length, the magnification is positive, and then the image is virtual and upright. So when di is -2 do, and f is positive, that leads to do being 10 inches. So the magnification is 2, which is correct. So the correct answer would be 10 inches, which is option C.

Wait, but why did I get 30 inches earlier? Because perhaps I inverted the magnification formula.

Wait, let me think: I think I mixed up m = hi/ho and m = -di/do. Oh wait, the magnification is m = - di/do. So when m is 2, that's a positive number, so di is negative. So di = -2 do. Substituting into the mirror equation gives us do = 10 inches.

Hmm, but the options have option C as 10 inches. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but why did I get a different answer earlier when I thought a magnification of 2 would imply a certain distance? Because I was using the formula m = di/do, which is incorrect. The correct formula is m = - di/do, which includes the negative sign for virtual images.

So the correct approach is to use m = - di/do. So m is positive 2 → di = -2 do.

Putting into mirror equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/20 = 1/do + 1/(-2 do) → 1/20 = (1 - 1/2)/do → 1/20 = (1/2)/do → do= (1/2) *20 → do= 10 inches.

So the answer is 10 inches, which is option C.

To determine the distance at which the concave mirror should be held from the man's face to produce an image of two-fold magnification, we analyze the problem using the mirror equation and magnification formula. The focal length of the concave mirror is given as \( f = 20 \, \text{in} \). The magnification \( m \) is \( 2 \), indicating a virtual, upright image. For a virtual image, the magnification is positive, and the image distance \( d_i \) is negative.

### Step 1: Magnification Formula
The magnification formula for mirrors is:
\[
m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]
Given \( m = 2 \), we have:
\[
2 = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} \implies d_i = -2d_o
\]

### Step 2: Mirror Equation
The mirror equation is:
\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]
Substituting \( d_i = -2d_o \) and \( f = 20 \, \text{in} \):
\[
\frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{-2d_o} \implies \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{d_o} - \frac{1}{2d_o}
\]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{20} = \frac{2 - 1}{2d_o} \implies \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{2d_o}
\]
Solve for \( d_o \):
\[
2d_o = 20 \implies d_o = 10 \, \text{in}
\]

### Step 3: Verification and Interpretation
The object is located \( 10 \, \text{in} \) in front of the mirror. Since the magnification is positive and the image is virtual, the image is upright and magnified by a factor of 2. This corresponds to the case where the object is within the focal length of the concave mirror, resulting in a virtual, upright image. The calculations confirm that the distance of \( 10 \, \text{in} \) satisfies the conditions for a two-fold magnification.

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **10 inches**, which corresponds to option C.
