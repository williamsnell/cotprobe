Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Aztec Empire. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the Aztec details, but I'll think it through.

The question is asking about what systematically expanded the Aztec Empire. The options are A to J. I remember that the Aztec were known for their vast network of trade routes, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the main one that expanded. Let me go through each option.

Option A: a vast network of roads and trade routes. I think the Aztecs did have extensive trade routes, but they were more about controlling them, moving goods, and possibly managing resources. I'm not sure if that's the one responsible for their expansion.

Option B: expansion and control of waterways for transportation and irrigation. Waterways were crucial for trade, especially for agriculture. The Aztecs built massive systems of canals and reservoirs, which allowed them to control vast areas. They needed to move goods and water efficiently, so this seems like a key area they expanded.

Option C: cultivation and trade of cacao and maize. The Aztecs were famous for their crops, especially maize. They used it to make various products. However, their main focus was more on trade and expanding their empire, not just domestic production.

Option D: religious beliefs requiring extensive and escalating human sacrifice. I remember the Aztecs had a lot of religious beliefs, especially about deities like Yohu and Tlacopahu. Their society was very religious, and their rulers, the Tlaxcing, were involved in a lot of violence and religious wars. But this more relates to their religious practices than the expansion of their empire.

Option E: tribute in the form of gold, jade, feathers, cloth, and jewels. I think the Aztecs were a big landowner, and their rulers, the Tlaxcing, imposed tribute. This was part of their way of life, but I'm not sure if it directly caused their empire expansion.

Option F: the establishment of colonies in unexplored territories. This sounds familiar. The Aztecs were known for establishing colonies in other Aztec ruins, like the Yucat√°n, Tenochtitlan, and Pachacuti. They used these colonies to expand their empire across Central America. This seems like a key point.

Option G: ceramic production, a distinctive architectural style, and artistic expression. While the Aztecs did produce many items, like pottery and art, their main focus was on their empire's expansion and trade. So this might not be the correct answer.

Option H: farming techniques like terracing and irrigation. I think they had terracing to control water flow and manage soil. Also, they used irrigation for water distribution, which was essential for their vast expansion.

Option I: a strict caste system promoting social stratification. I don't think the Aztecs had a caste system. They were more about hierarchy based on class and occupation, not strict social stratification.

Option J: oppressive social and religious control based on military conquest. The Aztecs were quite powerful, and their conquests were often based on their religious beliefs and military campaigns. This was a key reason for their rule, but the question is about what expanded, not how they were controlled.

So, going back, the question is about what systematically expanded. The expansion of their empire must be due to their ability to control resources and resources allowed them to expand their territories. Waterways were crucial for that, allowing them to transport goods and water across vast areas, which they needed for their empire's expansion. So option B makes sense.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that the Aztecs were known for their vast trade networks. The initial expansion might have been facilitated by their ability to control resources, which included waterways. So B seems correct.

The Aztec Empire's systematic expansion was primarily due to their ability to control resources, particularly waterways for transportation and irrigation, allowing them to expand their empire across vast territories. 

Answer: B
