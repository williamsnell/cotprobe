Okay, so I've got this question about finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 10. Hmm, I remember that LCM is the smallest number that both numbers divide into without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably list the multiples of each number and see where they first coincide. Let's start with 4. The multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, and so on.

Now, for 10. Its multiples are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, etc.

Looking at the two lists, I see that 20 is in both. Then 40, 60, etc. But the first common multiple is 20. So that should be the LCM. Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way without listing all the multiples.

Wait, another method I remember is using prime factorization. Let me try that. 

The prime factors of 4 are 2 x 2, which is 2². For 10, the prime factors are 2 x 5, so that's 2¹ x 5¹.

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of either number. So for 2, the highest power is 2², and for 5, it's 5¹. Multiplying these together gives 2² x 5¹ = 4 x 5 = 20. Yep, that matches what I found earlier.

So the least common multiple of 4 and 10 is 20. Looking at the options, option B is 20. So the correct answer should be B.

The least common multiple of 4 and 10 is found by identifying the smallest number that both divide into. Listing multiples or using prime factorization both confirm that 20 is the LCM.

Answer: B: 20
