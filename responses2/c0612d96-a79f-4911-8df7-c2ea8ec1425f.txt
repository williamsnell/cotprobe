Okay, so I've got this graph theory question here. The question is about finding the smallest number of vertices in a graph that guarantees either a clique of size 3 or an independent set of size 2. Hmm, let me think about this.

I remember some theorems related to cliques and independent sets. Oh right, Ramsey's theorem comes into play here. From what I recall, Ramsey's theorem gives a condition under which a certain structure is unavoidable. Specifically, R(s, t) is the smallest number of vertices such that any graph of that size contains either a clique of size s or an independent set of size t.

Wait, so in this case, the problem is asking for the smallest number of vertices that guarantees either a clique of size 3 (s=3) or an independent set of size 2 (t=2). So I'm looking for R(3,2). 

Let me think about the values of Ramsey numbers. I think R(3,3) is 6. That's the classic Ramsey number. So that's for when you can't avoid either a triangle or a triangle in the complement. But wait, is the question about R(3,2)?

Wait, R(s,t) is the smallest n such that any graph of n vertices contains a clique of size s or an independent set of size t. So R(3,2) would be the smallest number where any graph of that size has either a 3-clique or a 2-independent set.

Let me think. For R(3,2), I believe it's 5. Because with 5 vertices, any graph will have either a triangle or an independent set of size 2. Let me try to reason why.

Wait, maybe I should approach it more systematically. The Ramsey number R(s,t) for small s and t is known. For example, R(3,3)=6. So R(3,2) must be less than or equal to 5 because if you have 5 vertices, any graph must have either a triangle or an independent set of size 2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the possibilities. Suppose a graph has 5 vertices. What's the maximum number of edges it can have without containing a triangle? That's Turán's theorem, perhaps. Turán's theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size.

The Turán number for triangles (K3) is given by the formula (n^2)/4, but for n=5, it's (25)/4, but since edges are integers, it's 6. But wait, 5 choose 2 is 10, so the Turán number for triangle-free graphs is floor(n²/4). Wait, n=5, n²=25, 25/4 is 6.25, so floor is 6. So a triangle-free graph on 5 vertices can have at most 6 edges.

Wait, but in a graph of 5 vertices, if it has 6 edges, it must contain a triangle. Because Turán's theorem says that a triangle-free graph on 5 vertices can have at most 6 edges. So if a graph on 5 vertices has more than 6 edges, it must contain a triangle. But wait, a graph with 5 vertices can have up to 10 edges; 10 edges is a complete graph, which obviously has a triangle. So that's not the way to think about it.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the complement graph. Wait, the question is about a graph that must have either a clique of size 3 or an independent set of size 2. So if the graph is such that it doesn't have a triangle, then its complement must not have an independent set of size 2. Because an independent set in the original graph is a clique in the complement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Ramsey numbers. So for R(3,2), the Ramsey number is 5. Because in any graph of 5 vertices, you can't avoid having either a triangle or an independent set of size 2. Let me try to see why.

Suppose I have 5 vertices. Let's pick any vertex, say A. It can be connected to four others. If A is connected to at least two of them, let's say B and C. Now, if B and C are connected, then together with A, they form a triangle. So in that case, the graph has a triangle. But if B and C are not connected, then in the complement graph, the two vertices B and C are connected. So in the original graph, the edges between B and C are missing, meaning in the original graph, they form an independent set of size 2. Because if the original graph doesn't have an edge between B and C, then B and C are independent.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. The independent set in the original graph would be a set of vertices with no edges between them. So if B and C are not connected in the original graph, that's exactly an independent set of size 2. So in either case, the graph either contains a triangle or an independent set of size 2.

Hence, R(3,2) is 5. So the smallest number of vertices needed to guarantee either a triangle or an independent set of size 2 is 5. Looking back at the options, option C is 5. So the answer should be C.

The problem requires determining the smallest number of vertices in a graph that guarantees either a clique of size 3 or an independent set of size 2. Using Ramsey theory, specifically Ramsey's theorem, we find that the Ramsey number R(3,2) is 5. This means that any graph with 5 vertices will necessarily contain either a triangle (clique of size 3) or an independent set of size 2. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: 5

Answer: C
