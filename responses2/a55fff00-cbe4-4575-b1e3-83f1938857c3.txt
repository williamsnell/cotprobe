Okay, so I've got this question about grand jury proceedings. Hmm. I remember that grand juries are a specific type of jury, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The question is asking which statement is not true about grand juries. The options range from A to I, each making a different claim. I'll go through each one to see which is false.

Option A says the proceedings are conducted in secret. I think that's right. Grand juries are usually conducted in secret to protect the integrity of the hearing. So A is true, so the answer can't be A.

Option B claims the proceedings are conducted by a judge. Wait, no, that's not correct. Grand juries are administered by a jury, not a judge. So B is false, which would make it the correct answer if B is the one that's not true. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure.

Option C says the defendant has a right to present evidence. I remember that in most cases, especially in the US, the defendant is not allowed to present evidence during a grand jury. Instead, it's the judge or the jury that makes the decisions, which means the defendant doesn't have the right to speak. So C is a true statement, so it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option D states there's a right to Miranda warnings. Miranda rights are typically for criminal cases under the Fourth Amendment. Grand juries are for trials, which are usually in civil cases rather than criminal. So D is false, meaning it's not true about grand juries. Wait, but I'm not sure if all grand juries require Miranda rights. Maybe some do? I think in some cases, like in criminal proceedings, but generally, it's not a right for grand juries. So D is a false statement, meaning this is a possible answer.

Option E says the proceedings are open to the public. I remember that grand juries are usually held in secret. So E would be false, making it the correct answer. Wait, but I thought some might be open to the public. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. In the U.S., grand juries are conducted in secret, so E is false.

Option F: There's no right to have evidence excluded. That's a common hearsay issue. Grand juries require the judge to decide evidence's admissibility, so they can't exclude anything. So F is true, so not the answer.

Option G: The jury's decision must be unanimous. Wait, I thought grand juries don't require a majority vote. They can be any number, but the majority is the judge. So G is false, making it the correct answer.

Option H: There's no right to counsel. That's true because in the U.S., grand juries don't allow the defense to present evidence. So H is true, so not the answer.

Option I: The jury is made up of 12 people. I'm pretty sure that's not the case. Grand juries are usually larger, maybe 12, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, I think the size varies by case. Some might have 12, others more. But the statement is that it's made up of 12, which may not always be the case. So I'm not sure about I being true or not. But it's possible that the answer is about another option.

Wait, let's go back. The question is asking which statement is not true. So I need to find the false statement.

Let me go through each option again.

A: Conducted in secret. Correct. So not the answer.

B: Contest by a judge. No, it's the jury. So B is the false statement. Wait, but earlier I thought D was the false statement because it's about Miranda rights, which are for criminal cases. So if grand juries don't require Miranda, then D is a false statement as well.

C: Right to evidence. Yes, but only in criminal cases, so not for grand juries. So C is a false statement.

D: Miranda rights. No, so D is false.

E: Open to the public. No, it's secret. So E is false.

F: Evidence exclusion. Yes, so F is true.

G: Unanimous decision. No, so G is false.

H: Right to counsel. Yes, so H is true.

I: 12 people. Not necessarily, so I is false.

Wait, so all options except one are false. But the question says which is not true, so the false statement is the answer.

Looking back, the options:

A: True (proceeds in secret). So A is correct, so not the answer.

B: False (judges don't conduct juries). So B is false. So if B is the false statement, it would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought D was also a false statement, but perhaps I should check the exact law.

In the U.S., grand juries are conducted in secret except in cases where the defendant is not present. But in general, they are administered by a jury, not a judge. So B is false.

Similarly, D is about Miranda rights, which are not applicable to grand juries.

So both B and D are false.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is not true. So the incorrect statements are B, D, E, G, I.

Wait, no, let's think again.

Option A: Proceeds are conducted in secret. Yes, correct. So A is true.

B: Conducted by a judge. No, it's the jury. So B is false.

C: Right to evidence. Yes, in criminal cases. So C is false.

D: Miranda rights. No, grand juries don't require them. So D is false.

E: Open to the public. No, it's secret. So E is false.

F: No evidence exclusion. Correct. So F is true.

G: Unanimous decision. No, so G is false.

H: Right to counsel. Correct. So H is true.

I: 12 people? Not necessarily. So I is false.

Wait, that would mean all options except one are false. But the question is asking which is not true, i.e., the false one.

Wait, but looking back, I should check the options again.

Wait, another point: In some jurisdictions, grand juries may require a majority vote, but in others, they don't. So I'm not sure about the exact number. But that's a side point.

So the options are A to I, and the question is which is not true.

So the incorrect statements are B, C, D, E, G, I. The correct answer is the one that's not true.

Wait, the question is, which is not true about grand juries? So the false statement.

Looking at the options, the answer is B, C, D, E, G, I.

Wait, but the options are A to I.

Wait, the options are:

A: Conduct in secret.

B: Conduct by a judge.

C: Right to evidence.

D: Miranda rights.

E: Open to public.

F: No evidence excluded.

G: Unanimous.

H: Right to counsel.

I: 12 people.

So which of these is not true.

Wait, the correct answer is likely B, C, D, E, G, I.

But the question says "which is not true", so the false statement.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "is not true", so the incorrect statement.

Wait, let me think again.

Option A is correct, so not the answer.

Option B: Conducted by a judge. No. So B is false.

Option C: Right to evidence. Yes, in criminal cases. So C is false.

Option D: Miranda rights. No, so D is false.

Option E: Open to public. No, so E is false.

Option G: Unanimous. No, so G is false.

Option I: 12 people. Not necessarily, so I is false.

Wait, so all options except A are false. But the question is about which is NOT true. So the answer would be the one that's false.

Wait, but I'm getting a lot of statements that are false.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about each option again.

A: Conduct in secret. Yes. So A is true. So not the answer.

B: Contest by a judge. No, it's the jury. So B is false. So B is a possible answer.

C: Right to evidence. In criminal cases, yes. So C is true. So not the answer.

D: Miranda rights. Not applicable. So D is false. So D is another possible answer.

E: Open to the public. No, so E is false. So E is another.

G: Unanimous. No. So G is false.

I: 12 people. Not necessarily. So I is false.

Wait, that's six options that are false. But the question asks which is not true. So any of these is not true, but the question is about which one is false.

Wait, but the question is about which is not true. So all except one are not true. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Wait, the question is about grand juries. So, in the U.S., the grand jury is a specific type of jury, and they are conducted in secret. So A is true.

Grand juries don't have a right to present evidence, so C is true.

Option D is about Miranda, which is for criminal cases. Grand juries are for civil cases, so D is not true.

Option E: Grand juries are open to the public? No, they're secret, so E is not true.

Option G: Grand juries don't require a majority. So G is not true.

Option I: Grand juries are not 12 people. So I is not true.

So that's six options (B, C, D, E, G, I) that are not true. But the question is which is not true. So the answer is any of these. But that can't be right because the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake and some are true.

Wait, let's think again.

Option A: Conduct in secret. Correct. So A is true.

Option B: Conducted by a judge. No, it's the jury. So B is false.

Option C: Right to evidence. Yes, in criminal cases. So C is true.

Option D: Miranda rights. No, so D is false.

Option E: Open to public. No, so E is false.

Option F: No evidence excluded. Correct. So F is true.

Option G: Unanimous. No, so G is false.

Option H: Right to counsel. Yes, so H is true.

Option I: 12 people. Not necessarily, so I is false.

So the options that are not true are B, D, E, G, I.

Wait, that's five options. But the question is asking which is not true, so any of these would be acceptable. But that's impossible as the answer must be one letter.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the fact that in the U.S., grand juries are not required to be 12 people. So I is false.

But the question is, which is not true. So the answer could be any of these.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the question is:

Which is not true about grand juries?

So the incorrect statement is the answer. So which of the options is false.

Wait, considering the answer options, the correct answer is likely option B, because it's not true that grand juries are conducted by a judge. Alternatively, it could be option C.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I'm not sure which options are true or false.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, another approach: In the U.S., the grand jury is conducted in secret, so A is correct.

Grand juries do not have the right to present evidence, so C is correct.

They don't have the right to Miranda warnings, so D is correct.

They are not open to the public, so E is correct.

They don't have a right to a majority vote, so G is correct.

They don't have a right to have evidence excluded, so F is correct.

They are not required to be 12 people, so I is correct.

So the only option that is not true is B, which says they are conducted by a judge. They are not; they are administered by the jury.

Therefore, the answer is B.
