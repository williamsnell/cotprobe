Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25. Hmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that Z_30 is the group of integers modulo 30 under addition. So it's like the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 29} with addition modulo 30.

Now, a cyclic subgroup generated by an element 'a' in Z_n is just all the multiples of 'a' modulo n. So in this case, the subgroup generated by 25 in Z_30 would be {0, 25, 50 mod 30, ...} etc. Wait, but maybe a better way to think about it is to find the order of the element 25 in Z_30.

The order of an element 'a' in Z_n is given by n divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 'a' and n. So the formula is |a| = n / gcd(a, n). Oh right, because the order is the smallest positive integer k such that k*a is congruent to 0 mod n. That makes sense.

So in this problem, n is 30, and a is 25. Let's compute gcd(25,30). Let's see, the factors of 25 are 1,5,25 and factors of 30 are 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. The common factors are 1 and 5. So the gcd is 5.

Then the order of 25 in Z_30 is 30 divided by 5, which is 6. So the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 has 6 elements.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because, in Z_30, adding 25 six times: 25*1=25, 25*2=50 mod30 is 20, 25*3=75 mod30 is 15, 25*4=100 mod30 is 40 mod30 is 10, 25*5=125 mod30 is 25*5=125, 125-4*30=125-120=5. 25*6=150, 150-5*30=150-150=0. So yeah, the elements are 0,25,20,15,10,5, then back to 0. So that's six distinct elements. So the subgroup has six elements.

The cyclic subgroup generated by 25 in Z_30 has 6 elements.
