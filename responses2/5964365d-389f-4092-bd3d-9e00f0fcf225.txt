Okay, so I've got this problem about a gravity fed lock and a model study. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question says it's about scaling in a model and prototype. I remember something about model theory and similarity laws.

The problem is split into two parts. Part (a) asks about the time the prototype takes to fill, given that the model takes 0.8 minutes. And part (b) is about the ratio of mass flow rates between the model and prototype. Both are on the same scale of 1/100, so the geometric similarity.

Wait, geometric similarity implies that all linear dimensions are scaled by a factor, right? So, for a model to prototype, the scale factor (let's say k) is 1/100. So, all linear dimensions are 1/100 of the prototype. But for area and volume, it would be the square and cube of that.

Oh right, because area is two-dimensional and volume is three-dimensional. So, area scales with k squared, and volume with k cubed.

But wait, the lock is a container, so I'm guessing its volume is what's being filled. So, if the model's lock has a certain volume, the prototype's would be scaled by k^3.

But wait, the question is about the time to fill. So, the flow rate is volume over time. But what's the relationship between the model and prototype in terms of flow rate?

Wait, flow rate depends on the area of the opening and the velocity. Oh, but in a lock, the flow rate is probably related to the volume flow. But since we're dealing with a model and prototype, which are geometrically similar, I think the flow rates scale with the volume flow rate, which scales with (k)^3 for volume.

Wait, but the time taken to fill also depends on the flow rate. Because flow rate is volume per unit time. So, if the model takes t1, then the prototype t_p would be (volume_p / volume_m) * (t1 / flow rate_p / flow rate_m)? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, since the locks are similar, the flow rates would scale with the volume flow rate. So, if the model's flow rate is Q_m, the prototype's Q_p would be (k)^3 times Q_m. Because Q is proportional to (A * v), and A is k^2, v is k times the prototype velocity, so overall Q is k^3 * Q_p prototype.

Wait, no, wait: A is area, which scales with k^2. Velocity, if the lock is similar, probably scales with k as well, because the flow rate is proportional to the product of area and velocity. So, volume per time for flow rate is (k^2) * (k) ) = k^3.

So, Q_p = (k)^3 * Q_m.

But flow rate is also volume over time. So, if the model's flow rate is Q_m = V_m / t_m, then the prototype's Q_p = V_p / t_p.

But since V_p = k^3 V_m, and Q_p = (k^3 V_m) / t_p.

So, (k^3 V_m) / t_p = (k^3) (V_m / t_m).

Wait, because Q_p = (k^3) Q_m. And Q_m is V_m / t_m.

So substituting, Q_p = k^3 (V_m / t_m).

So, (k^3 V_m) / t_p = k^3 (V_m / t_m)

Cancel k^3 V_m from both sides (assuming they're non-zero), so 1/t_p = 1/t_m → t_p = t_m.

Wait, that can't be right because that would mean the time to fill is the same, but the options have varying times.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see. If the locks are geometrically similar, then the flow rate scales with (k)^3. So, Q_p = Q_m * (k)^3.

But t = V / Q. So, for the model, t_m = V_m / Q_m. And for the prototype, t_p = V_p / Q_p.

But V_p = k^3 V_m, and Q_p = k^3 Q_m.

So, t_p = (k^3 V_m) / (k^3 Q_m) ) = V_m / Q_m = t_m.

So, the time is the same. But that can't be right, because if the model takes 0.8 minutes, the prototype would take the same time. But the options don't say that. Let me look again.

Wait, in the options, option G is 8 min. But wait, the options for part (a) include 5,9,7, etc. Wait, the first part (a) says the model takes 0.8 minutes, so if according to this, the prototype takes the same time, 0.8 minutes. But the options don't have 0.8. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the acceleration or something. Maybe the model isn't exactly similar in all aspects. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scaling for flow rates.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the lock model isn't just a scaled model in terms of flow rate, but perhaps the time to fill depends on the flow rate.

Hmm, perhaps the model and prototype have different filling times because the flow rate in the model is not the same as the prototype. So, if the model's flow rate is higher or lower, the time could change.

Wait, maybe the model isn't scaled in the same way as volume. Or perhaps the lock's filling time depends on other factors.

Wait, let me think about the scaling laws again. Since the locks are geometrically similar, all linear dimensions scale by 1/100. So, the area scales by (1/100)^2, and the volume scales by (1/100)^3.

Wait, but the time to fill might be related to the flow rate. Since flow rate is volume per time, if the model's flow rate is lower than the prototype's, the time would be longer.

But how does the flow rate scale between model and prototype?

Flow rate Q is the volume flow rate, which is the volume per unit time. For a lock, the volume flow rate is the product of the cross-sectional area of the opening and the velocity of the water. So, Q = A * v.

If the model's lock is 1/100 scale, then both A_m and v_m would be scaled by 1/100. So, Q_m = (1/100)^2 * (1/100) * Q_p = (1/1e6) Q_p.

Wait, no, because A scales as (1/100)^2, and v scales as (1/100), so Q scales as (1/1e6) Q_p. So, Q_p = 1e6 * Q_m.

So, Q_p is a million times larger than Q_m.

But what about the volume of the lock? The model's lock has volume V_m = (1/100)^3 V_p, which is 1/1e6 V_p.

So, the prototype's volume is 1e6 times the model's.

Now, the time to fill is V / Q.

So, t_p = V_p / Q_p = (1e6 V_m) / (1e6 Q_m) ) = V_m / Q_m = t_m.

So, again, same time. So, that would mean the prototype takes 0.8 minutes, which isn't an option. So, either I'm doing something wrong, or perhaps the problem is considering other factors.

Wait, perhaps the lock's shape is such that the model isn't just a scaled version, but maybe it's a different shape. Or perhaps I'm missing something about how the time to fill scales when the flow rate changes.

Wait, another approach: If the model is scaled, then the time to fill is inversely proportional to the flow rate. So, if the flow rate increases, the time decreases, and vice versa.

If the model's flow rate is lower, the prototype's flow rate would be higher.

Wait, let me think. If the model's lock is scaled down, then the area is smaller. Suppose the model's lock has a smaller opening, so it takes longer to fill. Or, if the model's lock is faster, the prototype would be slower.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the scaling of time when the flow rate changes.

In a lock, the time to fill is V / Q.

But if the model's lock has a smaller Q, then the prototype would have a larger Q. Because Q_p = (1/100)^3 * Q_m = Q_m / 1e6.

So, Q_p = Q_m / 1e6.

So, V_p = (1/100)^3 V_m = V_m / 1e6.

So, t_p = V_p / Q_p = (V_m / 1e6) / (Q_m / 1e6) ) = V_m / Q_m = t_m.

Hmm, same time again. So, that suggests that the time remains the same, but the options don't have 0.8. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the model is not just a scaled model in terms of volume and area, but perhaps the velocity is different because of the shape. Or perhaps the model isn't geometrically similar in all aspects, but the problem states they are studied with a 1/100 scale model. So, they are geometrically similar.

Wait, so if the model is scaled down by 1/100, then the time to fill should be the same as the prototype.

But according to the options, the only option that has the same time as the model is 8 minutes, which is option G. So, perhaps the answer is G, 8 min.

Wait, but then why are the other options not matching? Let's look at part (b) first. Part (b) asks for the ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in the model and prototype locks. So, Q_p / Q_m.

As I calculated earlier, Q_p = (k)^3 Q_m. So, the ratio is (1/1e6) Q_m / Q_m = 1/1e6. So, Q_p is 1e-6 times Q_m.

Wait, but that's the mass flow rate. So, mass flow rate in the model is much less than the prototype. So, the ratio is 1e-6, which is λ^6, because 1e-6 is (1e-3)^2. Wait, wait: 1e-3 is 1/1000, so (1/1000)^2 is 1e-6.

So, the ratio is λ^6. Because λ = 1/100, so λ^6 is (1/100)^6 = 1e-12, which doesn't match. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the model's Q is 1/1e6 times the prototype's Q. So, Q_p is 1e6 times Q_m. So, Q_p/Q_m = 1e6. So, the ratio is 1e6, which is (10^3)^2 = 1e6. So, λ is 1/100, which is 0.01, so λ^7/2 is (0.01)^(3.5) = (1e-2)^3.5 = 1e-7 * sqrt(1e-2) )= appx 3.16e-8, which doesn't match 1e6.

Alternatively, 1e6 is (10^3)^2, which is (λ^2)^2 = λ^4. So, 1e6 is λ^4. But λ is 1/100, so λ^4 = (1/100)^4 = 1e-8. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the scaling. Let me think again.

If the model is scaled by k=1/100, then the flow rate Q_p = (k)^3 * Q_m.

So, Q_p = (1/100)^3 * Q_m = 1e-6 Q_m.

So, Q_p / Q_m = 1e-6.

So, the ratio is 1e-6, which is (1e-3)^2. But 1e-3 is λ. So, λ^2 = 1e-6. So, the ratio is λ^2.

Wait, that's from λ = 1/100. So, λ^2 is (1/100)^2 = 1e-4, which is 0.0001, not 1e-6. So, perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, what if the lock's shape is being considered? Maybe the model's lock is scaled, but the velocity is different. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the time to fill the lock. If the lock's volume is scaled by k^3, and the flow rate is scaled by k^3, then the time would be the same. But if the flow rate is scaled by k^2, the time would be scaled by k^(-2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try another approach. If the model is scaled by 1/100, all linear dimensions. The area of the opening is scaled by (1/100)^2, and the velocity would be scaled by (1/100) because the flow rate is the product of area and velocity.

So, velocity in model is v_m = (1/100) v_p.

Flow rate Q_m = A_m * v_m = (1/100)^2 * (1/100) v_p = (1/1e6) v_p.

So, Q_p = v_p.

Q_p is 1e6 times Q_m.

So, Q_p = 1e6 Q_m.

So, the time to fill the prototype is V_p / Q_p = (1e6 V_m) / (1e6 Q_m) ) = V_m / Q_m = t_m.

Wait, so the time remains the same. Thus, the prototype would take 0.8 minutes, which isn't an option. So, perhaps the answer for part (a) is 0.8 min, but the options don't have that. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the scaling.

Wait, perhaps the lock's volume isn't just scaled by k^3. Maybe the model is a scaled model with a different lock shape. But the problem states that it's a 1/100 scale model. So, the volume would scale by (1/100)^3.

Hmm. So, if the model takes 0.8 minutes, the prototype would take the same time. But the options don't have 0.8. The closest option is G:8 min. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the lock's shape is such that the model's time is different. For example, if the model's lock is a square, the prototype's lock is a cube. But in that case, the area and volume scaling would be different. But the problem states it's geometrically similar, so all linear dimensions scale by the same factor.

Wait, perhaps the model isn't scaled in the same way. Maybe the flow rate is inversely proportional to the scaling factor. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking at part (a), the model takes 0.8 min. The options are all about the prototype time.

Options are:

A:5, λ^7/2

B:9, λ^3/2

C:11, λ^4

D:12, λ^5/3

E:7, λ^4/2

F:6, λ^6/2

G:8, λ^5/2

H:4, λ^2

I:10, λ^3

J:15, λ^7/3

Wait, since the model's volume is (1/100)^3, the prototype's volume is 1e6 times larger. If the flow rate in the model is Q, the flow rate in the prototype is 1e6 Q. Because Q_p = (1e6) Q_m.

So, the time for the prototype t_p = V_p / Q_p = (1e6 V_m) / (1e6 Q_m) ) = V_m / Q_m = t_m.

So, same time. But none of the options have 0.8. Hmm. So, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Oh wait, perhaps the lock's shape isn't just a scaled model. Maybe the model's lock is a different shape, but I think the question states it is geometrically similar.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the flow rate is not directly scaling with the model's lock, but perhaps the prototype's lock has a different shape. But the problem says it's a 1/100 scale model, so I think the flow rate is scaled by (1/100)^3.

In that case, the time to fill remains the same, but the options don't have that. So, perhaps the model's lock isn't scaled in the same way as volume, but perhaps in terms of area or velocity.

Wait, maybe the time to fill the lock is inversely proportional to the flow rate. So, if the model's flow rate is lower, the prototype's is higher, so the time is shorter.

But according to my earlier calculations, the time would be the same. So, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the model's lock is a different lock, not scaled, but that can't be because the problem says it's a 1/100 scale model.

Wait, perhaps the model's lock is a scaled model where the lock's shape is such that the prototype takes longer. But again, I'm not recalling any such scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's time is 0.8 min, and the prototype's time is 0.8 * (1e3)^3. Because time scales with the inverse of flow rate and volume.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

If Q_p is 1e6 times Q_m, then t_p = V_p / Q_p = (V_m / 1e6) / (Q_m / 1e6) )= V_m/Q_m = t_m.

So, same time.

But the options don't have 0.8. So, perhaps the correct answer is G, which is 8 min, but that's not matching the time calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the scaling. Let's re-calculate.

Volume scales as (1/100)^3 = 1e-6.

Flow rate scales as (1/100)^3 = 1e-6.

So, flow rate in the prototype is 1e6 times that of the model.

So, Q_p = 1e6 Q_m.

So, t_p = V_p / Q_p = (V_m * 1e3^3) ) / (Q_m * 1e3^3) ) = V_m / Q_m = t_m.

So, again, same time. So, the answer would be the model's time, but none of the options have that. So, perhaps the problem is about the prototype's time, but in that case, the time would be 0.8 minutes, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the model is scaled, the prototype's time is inversely proportional to the flow rate ratio.

So, t_p = t_m * (Q_p / Q_m).

But since Q_p / Q_m = 1e6, t_p = t_m * 1e6.

So, 0.8 * 1e6 = 8e5 minutes, which is way too long. So, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the time scales with the inverse of the flow rate. So, t_p = t_m * (Q_m / Q_p).

Which is t_p = t_m * (1 / 1e6) ) = 0.8e-6 mins, which is way too small.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The correct answer for part (a) is 8 min, which is option G. But according to our analysis, the time would remain the same, so the answer should be the same as the model's, which is 0.8 min. But that's not an option. So, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but that implies the time is 8 min, which is option G, but why?

Wait, maybe the scaling is not for volume but for area. Maybe the model's lock is scaled by 1/100 in area, not volume. So, the prototype's lock is scaled by 1/100 in area and perhaps 1/100 in velocity. So, the flow rate Q_p = (1/100)^2 * (1/100) ) = (1e-6) Q_m.

So, Q_p is 1e-6 Q_m.

So, Q_p = 1e-6 Q_m.

Then, t_p = V_p / Q_p.

But V_p = (1/100)^3 V_m = 1e-6 V_m.

So, t_p = (1e-6 V_m) / (1e-6 Q_m) ) = V_m / Q_m = t_m.

Again, same time.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the model's lock is scaled by 1/100, but the prototype's lock is scaled by 1/100 as well, but the model's lock is a different lock, like a different shape, which would affect the flow rate. But the problem doesn't mention that.

Wait, perhaps the model's lock isn't scaled in terms of volume but in terms of something else, like width or length, and the model's lock's flow rate is lower, so the prototype's time is shorter.

But without knowing the relationship between the model's and prototype's flow rates, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the prototype's time in terms of the model's time. If the model's lock is scaled by 1/100, then the prototype's lock is scaled by 1/100. So, the time to fill the prototype would be the model's time multiplied by the ratio of the flow rates.

But the flow rate scales as (1/100)^3, so the ratio of flow rates Q_p/Q_m is (1/100)^3.

So, t_p = t_m * (Q_p/Q_m) )= t_m * (1e-6).

So, t_p = 0.8 * 1e-6 = 8e-7 minutes, which is way too small.

Hmm, I'm getting nowhere. Maybe I should just accept that the model's time is 0.8 min, and the prototype's time is same, but the options don't have 0.8. So, perhaps the answer is option G, 8 min.

But why? Because maybe I'm missing a factor where the model's lock is scaled in a way that the prototype's time is 0.8 * (1e3)^3.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the model's lock's volume is 1e6 times smaller, so the prototype's lock is 1e6 times larger. So, the time would be 0.8 * (1e6)^3. Which is way too big.

Hmm, I'm stuck. But the options have G as 8 min, which would be correct if the time remains the same. So, I'll go with option G.
</think>

The problem involves analyzing the scaling of time to fill a lock and the ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in a 1:100 scale model. Here's the breakdown:

### Part (a): Time to Fill the Prototype Lock
1. **Scaling Factor**: The model is scaled by a factor of \( \lambda = \frac{1}{100} \). For geometrically similar models, the volume scales by \( (\lambda)^3 = \lambda^3 \).
2. **Flow Rate Scaling**: The flow rate depends on volume and velocity. If the model's lock is scaled by \( \lambda \), both its volume and cross-sectional area are scaled by \( \lambda \), and its velocity is scaled by \( \lambda \). Thus, the flow rate scales as \( \lambda^3 \).
3. **Time to Fill**: The time to fill is inversely proportional to the flow rate. If the flow rate increases by a factor of \( \lambda^3 \), the time decreases by the same factor. Hence, the prototype takes the same time as the model.

### Part (b): Ratio of Mass Flow Rates
1. **Flow Rate Ratio**: The model's flow rate is \( Q_m \), and the prototype's flow rate is \( Q_p \). Using scaling:
   \[
   Q_p = \lambda^3 Q_m
   \]
2. **Ratio**: The ratio of the prototype's flow rate to the model's flow rate is:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \lambda^3
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda = \frac{1}{100} \):
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^3 = \lambda^3
   \]

### Analysis of Options
From the analysis:
- The prototype takes the same time as the model, which is \( 0.8 \, \text{minutes} \), but this is not an option.
- The ratio of mass flow rates is \( \lambda^3 \), which corresponds to option **G: 8 min**. However, this assumes the time remains constant, which contradicts the calculations.

### Conclusion
Given the scaling analysis, the prototype's time remains the same as the model's time. However, the closest matching option, despite potential discrepancies, is **G: 8 min**.

ANSWER: G
