Okay, so I have this economics question about monetary policy. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a contractionary monetary policy and how it affects nominal interest rates, aggregate demand, output, and the price level. I need to figure out the correct option from A to J.

First, what do I remember about contractionary monetary policy? Oh right, contractionary policies are used to reduce the economy's output and reduce inflation. They usually involve increasing interest rates. So, when the central bank loosens monetary conditions, the nominal interest rate goes up. That makes sense because when the economy is struggling, people might demand more expensive loans to borrow money, which increases the interest rate.

Now, how does this affect aggregate demand? Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services. With higher interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive. So, people might save more instead of borrowing, which reduces their spending. That would cause a decrease in aggregate demand. So, the nominal interest rate goes up, and aggregate demand decreases.

Next, what about output? Output is the total production of goods and services. If people are spending less because of higher interest rates, it might lead to less economic activity. So, output probably decreases. That's why the economy isn't producing as much as before.

Finally, the price level. If aggregate demand is down and the economy isn't producing enough, prices might go up. So, the price level increases.

Now, looking at the options, each option has a combination of changes for each aspect. Let's go through them.

Option A: Decrease, Decrease, Decrease, Increase. Wait, I'm thinking the interest rate goes up, so A's first part is wrong. So A is out.

Option B: Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Increase. Oh, the interest rate is up, so B's first part is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Increase, Increase, Decrease, Decrease. Wait, the interest rate is up, so the first is wrong. No, C's first part is wrong. So C is out.

Option D: Decrease, Increase, Increase, Increase. First, the interest rate goes up, so D's first part is wrong. So D is not correct.

Option E: Decrease, Increase, Decrease, Increase. Wait, interest rate increases (correct). Aggregate demand decreases (correct, because AD is spending less). Output decreases (correct). Price level increases (correct). So E's first three parts are correct, but the last part is also correct. So E looks promising.

Wait, let me check what each option says. The question is: "will cause the nominal interest rate, aggregate demand, output, and price level to change in which of the following ways?" So each option lists four changes. So all four must match.

Looking at option E: all four are correct. So yes, E says: Decrease, Increase, Decrease, Increase. Wait, but I thought the output should decrease, not increase. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if AD decreases, output might decrease as well. So E's third part is output decreases, which matches. So E is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. When the central bank increases the interest rate (contractionary policy), people's real balances might change, leading to lower spending. So AD decreases, which leads to lower output. So option E says: interest rate decreases? No, wait, no. Wait, the first part of option E is 'Decrease' for the interest rate. Wait, no, wait: if the central bank is doing a contractionary policy, the interest rate increases. So option E's first part is 'Decrease' for the interest rate? No, that's not right. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question is, the contractionary policy causes changes. So, when a central bank uses contractionary policy, the interest rate increases. So in the options, the interest rate's change depends on the policy.

Looking at the options, option E's first change is 'Decrease' for the interest rate. That would mean the central bank is causing the interest rate to decrease, which is incorrect. So option E is wrong because the interest rate should increase.

Wait, but I thought the options might have correct changes. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The question is about the contractionary policy, so what happens? The nominal interest rate increases. So the first change should be 'Increase' not 'Decrease'.

So looking at the options, looking for which option has the first part as 'Increase'.

Looking at the options: options B, D, E, and perhaps others. Let's see:

Option B: Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Increase. So first part is correct.

Option E: Decrease, Increase, Decrease, Increase. So first part is incorrect.

Option B: So the first part is correct. Let's check the other parts.

If contractionary policy increases interest rates, then:

Aggregate demand (AD) decreases. So second part is correct.

Output decreases. Third part correct.

Price level increases. Fourth part correct.

So option B's changes are: Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Increase.

Wait, but I thought the output would decrease, so option B's third part is correct.

So option B says:

Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Increase.

So interest rate up (correct), AD down (correct), output down (correct), price level up (correct). So option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option E was correct, but that might be wrong because the first part was 'Decrease' which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, option E is: Decrease, Increase, Decrease, Increase. So the first part is 'Decrease' for interest rate, which doesn't match a contractionary policy. So E is wrong.

So option B is correct.

But wait, another thought: the effect on AD. If interest rates go up, spending decreases, so AD decreases. So AD is the total demand for goods and services. If people choose to save more, they spend less, so AD decreases. So that's correct.

Wait, so the correct option is B: Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Increase.

Wait, but I thought output would decrease, so option B's third part is correct.

Wait, but another way to think: when the economy is in a recession and the central bank wants to reduce output, they might lower the interest rate. But in this case, it's the opposite: they are using contractionary policy, which increases the interest rate. So yes, output decreases, which matches B's third part.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The question involves analyzing the effects of a contractionary monetary policy on the nominal interest rate, aggregate demand, output, and the price level. Contractionary monetary policy typically involves increasing the nominal interest rate to reduce aggregate demand, shift output downward, and raise the price level.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Contractionary Monetary Policy**: This policy aims to reduce economic activity by increasing the nominal interest rate. It lowers borrowing costs and discourages spending, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand.

2. **Impact on Aggregate Demand (AD)**: With higher interest rates, people may prefer to save more rather than borrow, reducing their spending. Thus, AD decreases.

3. **Impact on Output**: Lower AD can lead to insufficient demand for goods and services, causing output to decrease.

4. **Impact on Price Level**: Lower AD can result in higher prices, as the economy struggles to meet demand, leading to an increase in the price level.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The nominal interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option B**: Correct. The interest rate increases, AD decreases, output decreases, and the price level increases.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The interest rate increases, not decreases.
- **Option B** is the only correct choice, as it accurately reflects the effects of contractionary monetary policy on the specified variables.
