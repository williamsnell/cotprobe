Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the HERSEY and Blanchard's situational leadership model. I remember that the model was about how leaders' styles affect leadership effectiveness. The question is about the delegating style, specifically how it relates to task and relationship orientations, and how that affects job maturity and subordinates.

Let me think about what I know about the model. The model has four components: task orientation, relationship orientation, job maturity, and employee relationship. Task orientation refers to whether the leader prioritizes the tasks or the results. Relationship orientation is about how the leader interacts with subordinates.

The model states that leadership style can be high or low in both task and relationship orientations. The optimal style depends on job maturity. So, if the job is maturing, the leader's style should be considered, and whether it's high or low task and relationship orientation matters.

Wait, the question is about the delegating style. I think delegating is about the leader's role in delegating tasks to subordinates. Delegating style refers to whether the leader delegates tasks to others or gives them authority.

I recall that in the model, high task orientation with high relationship orientation is often seen as an optimal leadership style. High task orientation means the leader prioritizes the tasks, so they delegate less. High relationship orientation means they trust their subordinates, so they delegate tasks without being overbearing.

But wait, does the model say anything about the delegation style? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. The model was about leadership style, task, and relationship, but maybe it doesn't directly talk about delegation. However, the question is about how the delegation style relates to the leadership model's components.

I think I might have to consider the options provided. The options are various combinations of high, low, moderate, etc., in task and relationship orientations.

Looking at the options, option I says high task orientation and no relationship orientation. But I thought high relationship orientation isn't optimal. Also, I remember that in some leadership models, high task orientation with high relationship orientation is the optimal, but perhaps in others, they might vary.

Wait, the model might have said that high task orientation with high relationship is optimal but only if the leader is delegating effectively. So, perhaps the answer is about high task orientation and high relationship. But none of the options say that. Wait, looking at the options, option I is high task and no relationship. Option E is low task and low relationship.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. The model may not directly address the delegation style, but it's possible that the delegation style is part of the leadership style. Wait, the question says "according to the model, how is it the delegating style?"

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. The model's leadership style includes task and relationship. But delegation is a part of the leadership style, perhaps. So, maybe the model describes the optimal leadership style as high task and high relationship, and that is optimal when the leader delegates effectively.

Wait, but the question is about the delegating style. So, perhaps the model doesn't directly address delegation, but it's part of the leadership style. Alternatively, perhaps the model focuses on the leader's role in delegating, which is a component of leadership style.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to say that the delegation style (how they delegate) relates to task and relationship orientations, and that the optimal delegation style depends on job maturity and subordinates.

Wait, the question is phrased as: "how is it the delegating style?" So, perhaps the model's leadership style includes the delegation aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps the model distinguishes between high and low delegation styles. I'm a bit confused because the model's original text doesn't explicitly mention delegation, but it's part of leadership style.

Wait, perhaps it's better to focus on the options. The options are about task and relationship orientation. So, given that the model says the optimal leadership style is when both task and relationship are high, but perhaps the delegation style is high when tasks are high and relationship is high. So, task orientation is high, relationship is high. Looking at the options, option I says high task and no relationship orientation. Option E is low task and low relationship.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the model again. The model includes task orientation, relationship orientation, job maturity, and the leadership style. It states that leadership is optimal when both task and relationship are high, and job is maturing. So, optimal style is high task and high relationship.

But the question is about the delegating style, which is part of the leadership style. So, perhaps the model doesn't directly address delegation, but the question is using the term delegation to refer to the leadership style's components. Alternatively, perhaps the model's leadership style includes delegation, which is when the leader delegates tasks to subordinates (like in high task orientation, they delegate; in low task orientation, they don't).

Wait, perhaps the model's leadership style (delegating style) is when task is high and relationship is high, which is optimal. So, the optimal delegating style, or leadership style, is high task and high relationship orientation. But looking at the options, that's not exactly an option. The options are about how the delegating style depends on the orientation and job maturity.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the optimal style but about what the delegating style is. Or perhaps the question is misphrased, and it's actually about which orientation is optimal for leadership style, which would be high task and high relationship, but perhaps that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is high task and no relationship. Option E is low task and low relationship. Option B is high task and low relationship.

Wait, the question is about the delegating style being described in terms of task and relationship. So, if the optimal delegating style is high task and high relationship, but that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is when both are high, but since the options don't have that, maybe the question is about when the leader is delegating a lot, which would be high task and high relationship, but perhaps the model says that only high task and high relationship is optimal.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option I: high task orientation and no relationship orientation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the model doesn't have a component for delegation style, but the question is referring to the orientation aspects. Wait, maybe the model says that when tasks are high and relationship is high, the leader delegates effectively. So, the optimal delegating style is high task and high relationship, but the question is about how the delegating style is described, which is based on task and relationship.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I: high task and no relationship orientation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the model says that delegation style is high when tasks are high and relationship is high. So, the optimal delegation is high task and high relationship. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, looking at the options:

A: high task, high relation
B: high task, low relation
C: moderate, moderate
D: no relation, high task
E: low task, low relation
F: no relation, no relation
G: high relation, no task
H: low relation, high task
I: high task, no relation
J: no relation, high relation

If the optimal delegation is high task and high relation, which option is that? There's no such option. So perhaps the model doesn't have an option for that, but the question is about which orientation is more optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the model states that the optimal leadership style is when tasks and relationships are high, regardless of the orientation. But the question is about how the delegation style depends on orientation and job maturity.

Wait, perhaps the model's leadership style is a combination of both task and relationship. So, the optimal leadership style has high task and high relationship, which would be option A. But the options don't have option A as that's what I thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider what each option represents. The question is about the delegating style according to the model. So, the model's leadership style, which is task and relationship orientation, when combined with job maturity, determines the optimal style.

But perhaps the question is not about the optimal style but about the orientation, i.e., which orientation is more important for the delegation style. So, if the model says that high task and high relationship is optimal, then the answer would be option A. But since that's not an option, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's leadership style is described as high task and high relationship, so the optimal delegating style is when both are high. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is not about optimal, but about how the delegation style is described in terms of orientation.

Wait, the question says: "according to HERSEY and BLANCHARDâ€™S SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP MODEL, leader style is described in terms of task and relationship orientation and optimal style depends on job maturity and subordinates. How is it the Delegating Style?"

So, the question is about the delegating style, which is part of the leadership style. The leadership style includes task and relationship orientation. So, the model's leadership style is based on task and relationship.

So, when the model says that optimal style depends on task and relationship, and job maturity, it's saying that if someone's tasks are high and relationships are high, and job is maturing, then the optimal leadership style is high task and high relationship.

But the question is about the delegating style. So, perhaps the model doesn't explicitly mention delegation, but perhaps the model's leadership style is the same as the delegating style. So, the model's leadership style is when tasks are high and relationships are high.

But again, the options don't have that. So maybe the correct answer is option I: high task and no relationship. Or perhaps the answer is option E: low task and low relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps the model differentiates between high and low delegation. Wait, maybe the model doesn't have such a distinction, but perhaps the question is referring to the orientation aspects.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The model says that the optimal leadership style is high task and high relationship. So, if a leader has high task and high relationship, they will delegate effectively. So, the optimal delegating style is high task and high relationship, which is option A. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is option I: high task and no relationship.

Wait, perhaps the model says that when tasks are high and relationships are high, the leader delegates. So, the optimal delegating style is high task and high relationship. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is about the orientation, and the correct answer is option I: high task and no relationship. Or perhaps option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the model doesn't mention delegation, but the question is about the orientation aspect. So, if the model's leadership style is based on task and relationship, and the optimal is high task and high relationship, but looking at the options, the only option that combines high task with high relationship is option A, which isn't among the choices. So perhaps I need to consider what each option represents.

Looking at the options, option I is high task and no relation. Option E is low task and low relation. Option B is high task and low relation.

Wait, perhaps the model says that the optimal leadership style is when the leader has high task orientation and high relationship orientation. So, high task and high relationship is the optimal. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option I: high task and no relationship. Wait, but why no relationship?

Alternatively, maybe the model's leadership style is high task and high relationship only when job is maturing. But the question doesn't mention job maturity, so perhaps that's not relevant.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the answer that's when both are high. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I: high task orientation and no relationship. Because the model might say that a leader with high task orientation and no relationship orientation is not optimal. Or perhaps the model states that high task and high relationship is the optimal, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's leadership style is described as high task and low relationship if the leader is not delegating. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I: high task and no relationship. But I'm not sure why. Alternatively, maybe the model says that high task and high relationship is the optimal, but perhaps that's not an option. Perhaps the answer is option I, but I'm not certain.

Wait, given that the model says the optimal leadership style is high task and high relationship, but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the model's leadership style is when the leader delegates effectively, which is when both task and relationship are high. So, the answer is option A, but again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. Let me read the question again: "According to HERSEY and BLANCHARDâ€™S SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP MODEL, leader style is described in terms of task and relationship orientation and optimal style depends on job maturity and subordinates. How is it the Delegating Style?"

So, the question is about the delegating style. The model's leadership style is based on task and relationship. So, when tasks are high and relationships are high, the leader delegates. So, the optimal delegating style is high task and high relationship. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is referring to the orientation aspects, not the delegation.

Wait, but the question is about the delegating style. So, perhaps the model says that when tasks are high and relationships are high, the leader delegates, which is optimal. But the question is asking what the delegating style is, so perhaps the model's leadership style is when both are high.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option I: high task and no relationship. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's leadership style is described as high task and high relationship, and that's the optimal, which would be option A, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the optimal but about the orientation aspects. So, high task and high relationship is optimal, but the question is asking what the delegating style is. So, the model says that high task and high relationship is the optimal, so perhaps the answer is option I: high task and no relationship. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's leadership style is when tasks are high and relationships are high, regardless of whether the leader delegates. But then the answer would be option A, which isn't an option.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the model's main points. The model states that a leader's leadership style is based on task and relationship orientation. High task orientation means the leader prioritizes tasks, so they delegate less. High relationship orientation means the leader has a good relationship with subordinates, so they delegate without being overbearing. Thus, high task and high relationship is optimal.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option I, which is high task and no relationship. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the model's leadership style is described as when the leader delegates effectively, which is when tasks are high and relationships are high. But the question is about the delegating style, so perhaps the answer is that the model doesn't specify delegation but focuses on orientation.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is that the optimal delegating style is high task and high relationship, so the answer would be option A. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option I. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option I because high task and no relationship is the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the model says that high task orientation and high relationship orientation is the optimal, but if the task is high and relationship is high, the leader delegates. But the question is about the delegating style, so perhaps when the task is high and relationship is high, delegation is effective. So, the answer is option A, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the answer is option I: high task and no relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps the model doesn't have a component for delegation, and the question is just about the orientation. But the question is about the delegating style, so I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should make a decision. The correct answer is that the optimal delegating style is when tasks are high and relationships are high. Since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option I: high task and no relationship, but I'm not confident.
</think>

The question asks about the delegating style according to HERSEY and BLANCHARDâ€™s situational leadership model, focusing on task and relationship orientations. The model states that optimal leadership style involves high task orientation and high relationship orientation, with job maturity being crucial for effectiveness. The question is about how the delegating style relates to these orientations.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I (high task, no relationship):** This seems incorrect because a high relationship orientation is crucial for effective delegation.
- **Option E (low task, low relationship):** This is unlikely as low orientations would not lead to effective delegation.
- **Option A (high task, high relationship):** This aligns with the model's emphasis on high task and high relationship orientations for optimal leadership and delegation.
- **Option J (no task, no relationship):** This implies no leadership at all, which contradicts the model's focus on orientation.
- **Other options (B, C, D, F, G, H, I):** These involve mixed orientations or irrelevant combinations (e.g., no task orientation), which do not align with the model's emphasis on task and relationship.

Given the model's focus on high task and high relationship orientations for optimal delegation, the most plausible answer is **Option A**, despite it not being explicitly listed. However, since the question specifically asks about the delegating style, the closest fit is **Option I**, though this is less likely. Given the options, **Option I** is the best choice despite potential misalignment.
