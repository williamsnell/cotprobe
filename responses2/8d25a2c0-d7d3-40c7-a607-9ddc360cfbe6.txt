Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies three different remainder conditions when divided by 8, 3, and 11. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. The number we're looking for, let's call it N, should leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 8. So mathematically, that means N ≡ 5 mod 8. Similarly, when N is divided by 3, the remainder is 1, so N ≡ 1 mod 3. And when divided by 11, the remainder is 7, so N ≡ 7 mod 11. 

I think the best approach here is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact conditions. Let me see. The Chinese Remainder Theorem applies when the moduli are coprime. Let's check if 8, 3, and 11 are coprime. 

- 8 and 3: Their GCD is 1, so coprime.
- 8 and 11: GCD is 1, so coprime.
- 3 and 11: GCD is 1, so coprime.

Since all pairs are coprime, the Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us there's a unique solution modulo 8*3*11 = 264. So the solution will be the smallest positive integer within this range that satisfies all three conditions.

But since the options given are all much smaller than 264, I don't need to worry about the unique solution being beyond the options. However, it's possible that the answer is one of these, so I should find the smallest N that meets all three conditions.

Let me try to find N step by step. Starting with the first condition: N ≡5 mod8. That means N can be written as 8k +5, where k is an integer. Let's list some possible N's: 5,13,21,29,37,45,53,61,69,77,85,93,101,109,117,125,133,141,149,157,165,173,181,189,197,205,213,221,229,237,245,253,261,269, etc.

Now, from these, we need to find which number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. Let's check each N mod3.

- 5%3=2 → not 1.
- 13%3=1 → this is good. So N could be 13, 41, 69, 97, 125, 153, 181, 209, 237, 265, etc. But wait, 265 is larger than 264, which is the modulus. But since 8*3=24, and 24*11=264, the modulus is 264, so 265 is beyond that. So perhaps 13 is the first candidate, but let's see if it also satisfies the third condition.

Wait, N=13: 13 divided by 11 gives remainder 2 (since 11*1=11, 13-11=2). But we need a remainder of 7. So 13 doesn't work. Next in the list is 41. Let's check 41 mod3. 3*13=39, 41-39=2 → remainder 2. Not 1. Next is 69. 69 mod3 is 0, which is not 1. Next is 97. 97 divided by 3 is 32*3=96, so 97-96=1 → remainder 1. So 97 is a candidate. Now check if 97 mod11 is 7. Let's calculate: 11*8=88, 97-88=9, which is 9 mod11. But wait, the remainder is 9, not 7. So 97 doesn't satisfy the third condition.

Next candidate: 125. 125 mod3. 3*41=123, 125-123=2 → remainder 2. Not 1. Next is 153. 153 mod3 is 0. 181: 181 mod3: 1+8+1=10, 10 mod3 is 1? Wait, 10/3 is 3*3=9, remainder1. So 181 mod3=1. So 181 is a candidate. Now check mod11: 11*16=176, 181-176=5 → remainder5, which is not 7. So no.

Next: 209. 209 mod3: 2+0+9=11 →11 mod3=2. Not good. Next is 237. 237 mod3: 2+3+7=12 →12/3=4 → 0. So mod3=0. Not 1.

Next is 265, but that's beyond 264, so modulus 8*3*11=264, so 265 is not in the range. So the next possible candidates after 97 would be 265, which is beyond the modulus, so we can't use it. So perhaps the next number after 97 that satisfies the first two conditions would be 97 + lcm(8,3) = 97+24=121. But 121 mod3 is 121-3*40=121-120=1 → mod3=1. So 121 satisfies the first two conditions. Now, check mod11: 121 /11 is exactly 11, so remainder 0. But we need 7, so no.

Next candidate: 121 + 24=145. 145 mod3: 1+4+5=10 →10 mod3=1. So 145 mod3=1. Now mod11: 145 /11 is 13*11=143, remainder 2. So 2 mod11. Not 7. Next, 145 +24=169. 169 mod3:1+6+9=16 →16 mod3 is 1. So mod3=1. mod11: 169-154=15 →15 mod11 is 4. Not 7.

Next: 169+24=193. mod3:1+9+3=13 →13 mod3=1. mod11: 193-176=17 →17 mod11 is6, which is not 7. Next candidate: 193+24=217. mod3:2+1+7=10→1 mod3. mod11:217/11=19*11=209 →217-209=8→8 mod11. Not 7.

Next:217+24=241. mod3:2+4+1=7→7 mod3=1. mod11:241-231=10 →10 mod11. Not 7.

Next:241+24=265. But that's beyond 264, so we can't use it. So we have to look beyond that, but since the modulus is 264, perhaps 265 is the first, but it's beyond the modulus. So, none of the candidates beyond 97 and 265 satisfy all three conditions. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier and there's a smaller number than 97 that satisfies all three. Let me check my earlier list again.

Wait, earlier I thought of 41, which was not good. Let me go back. At N=5: 5 mod3=2 → no. 13: 1mod3. So N=13 is a candidate but doesn't satisfy mod11. Next, 41: 41 mod3=2 → no. 69: 69 mod3=0 → no. 97: mod3=1. Then mod11: 97/11=8*11=88, 97-88=9. So 9 mod11, which is not 7. So 97 is out.

Wait, maybe I should try another approach. Let's try to find N such that:

N ≡5 mod8 → N=8k+5

Now, also N ≡1 mod3. So substituting N=8k+5 into this:

8k +5 ≡1 mod3 → 8k ≡-4 mod3 → since 8 mod3 is 2, this becomes 2k ≡ (-4) mod3 → which is the same as 2k ≡2 mod3 (because -4 mod3 is 2). So 2k ≡2 mod3 → divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 3 are coprime, this is allowed). So k ≡1 mod3 → k=3m +1, where m is an integer.

So substituting back into N: N=8*(3m+1) +5=24m +8 +5=24m +13. So N=24m +13.

Now, this N must also satisfy N ≡7 mod11. Let's set up the equation:

24m +13 ≡7 mod11 → 24m ≡-6 mod11.

24 mod11 is 24-22=2, so 2m ≡-6 mod11 → 2m ≡5 mod11 (since -6 mod11 is 5).

Now, solve for m: 2m ≡5 mod11 → multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod11. The inverse of 2 mod11 is 6, since 2*6=12≡1 mod11. So m≡5*6 mod11 →30 mod11 is 8 (since 11*2=22, 30-22=8). So m≡8 mod11 → m=11n +8, where n is an integer.

Substituting back into N: N=24*(11n +8) +13=264n +192 +13=264n +205.

Now, the smallest positive integer N is when n=0 → N=205.

Wait, but looking at the options, 205 is one of them (option E). But wait, earlier I thought that 97 was the candidate, but according to this calculation, the smallest N is 205. Let me check where I went wrong earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me check the first calculation again. Let me see: when N=205, does it satisfy all three conditions?

205 ÷8: 8*25=200 →205-200=5 → remainder5. Good.

205 ÷3:3*68=204 →205-204=1 → remainder1. Good.

205 ÷11: 11*18=198 →205-198=7 → remainder7. Perfect. So 205 is indeed a solution.

But looking at the options, 205 is option E, which is one of the choices. However, the options given don't include 205 as the correct answer because I might have made a miscalculation in the initial steps. Let me check.

Wait, looking back, when I found N=205, is that the smallest? Because the first approach where I started with N=8k+5 and found that after 97, the next was 205, which is the smallest in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if there is a smaller N that satisfies all three conditions, but according to the modulus, 205 is the first after 97, but perhaps I have to see if there's a smaller number in the options that meets all three conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine my first approach to see where I might have made a mistake. Let me try another approach using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

The system is:

N ≡5 mod8 → N=8k+5

N ≡1 mod3 → substituting, 8k+5 ≡1 mod3 → 8k ≡ -4 mod3 → 2k ≡2 mod3 → k ≡1 mod3 → k=3m+1

Thus, N=8*(3m+1)+5=24m +13

Now, N ≡7 mod11 → 24m +13 ≡7 mod11 → 24m ≡-6 mod11 → 2m ≡5 mod11 → m≡8 mod11 → m=11n +8

So N=24*(11n +8)+13=264n +192 +13=264n +205

So the smallest positive integer is N=205 when n=0.

Looking at the options, 205 is option E. So the answer should be E:205.

Wait, but the options include 103, 100, 123, etc. Let me see if any of these satisfy the conditions.

Check 103: 
Divided by8: 103/8=12*8=96 → remainder7. But we need remainder5. So no.

100: 
100 mod8: 100-12*8=4 → remainder4. Not 5.

100 mod3: 100/3=33*3=99 → remainder1. Good for mod3. But mod8 is 4, which is not 5. So no.

123: 
123 mod8: 15*8=120 →3 → mod8=3. Not 5.

123 mod3: 1+2+3=6 → mod3=0. Not 1.

123 mod11: 11*11=121 →123-121=2 → mod11=2. Not 7.

175: 
175 mod8: 175-21*8=175-168=7 → mod8=7. Not 5.

175 mod3: 1+7+5=13 →13 mod3=1 → good. mod11: 175/11=15*11=165 →175-165=10 → mod11=10. Not 7.

233: 
233 mod8: 233-29*8=233-232=1 → mod8=1. Not 5.

233 mod3: 2+3+3=8→8 mod3=2 → not 1.

260: 
Wait, 260 is beyond the modulus of 264, but let's check:

260 mod8: 260-32*8=260-256=4 → mod8=4. Not 5.

260 mod3: 260/3=86*3=258 →260-258=2 → mod3=2. Not 1.

260 mod11: 260/11=23*11=253 →260-253=7 → mod11=7. So mod8=4, which is not 5. So no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Looking back, the options are A through J: A:103, B:100, C:123, D:123, E:205, F:400, G:175, H:233, I:77, J:205.

Wait, 205 is option E. So the correct answer is E:205.

But wait, earlier when I calculated using the CRT approach, I found N=205 as the minimal solution. But looking at the options, 205 is there. So why is option D:123 also present in the options? Let me check 123 again.

Wait, 123 mod8: 123-15*8=123-120=3 → mod8=3. Not 5.

So 123 is out. So the correct answer is E:205.
</think>
