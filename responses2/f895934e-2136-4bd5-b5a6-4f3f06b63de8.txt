Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about price elasticity of demand. I need to figure out which option makes the demand more elastic, meaning the quantity demanded responds more to a change in price.

Let me start by recalling what price elasticity of demand means. It's a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in price. The formula is usually used, but I'm more interested in the factors that affect it.

The question is asking which factor makes the price elasticity of demand greater. So, factors that cause the demand to be more responsive to price changes.

Looking at the options:

A: If the proportion of the good in the consumer's budget is high, that might mean that the good is a luxury. Luxury goods have more elastic demand because they're considered a big part of the consumer's budget. So, when price goes up, people might buy more of it. So, higher proportion would make elasticity higher.

B: Limited substitutes. If there are fewer substitutes, consumers have fewer options, so they might be more price-sensitive. So, this would lead to higher elasticity. For example, if there's only one brand, a price increase would lower demand more.

C: If the product is unique and has no substitutes, that's similar to B. A unique product without substitutes would make demand more elastic because there's no other option, so any price change would significantly affect quantity demanded.

D: High income. That relates to the income elasticity of demand. If the product is a luxury, demand is elastic when income rises. But if income is high, maybe the product is a necessity. Wait, if income is high, people might buy more, but that's about income level, not price. So, high income doesn't directly affect price elasticity; it affects the quantity demanded at a given price.

E: Short time to respond. That's related to price sensitivity in the short run vs. long run. Shorter time to adjust means more elastic. So, if a product's demand takes time to respond, the elasticity is higher. So, a short time would increase elasticity.

F: High brand value. Higher brand value might mean that consumers are willing to pay more, which could reduce the price sensitivity. So, higher brand value would make demand less elastic. So, this is the opposite of what the question is asking.

G: Perishable. Perishables have limited stock, so demand is more elastic because consumers might buy it quickly and not care much about price changes. So, yes, this would make demand more elastic.

H: Luxury product. Luxury goods are more elastic because they're considered a big part of the budget. So, higher elasticity here.

I: If product is a necessity, then changes in price have a smaller effect on demand. Necessities are inelastic. So, if the product is a necessity, demand is less elastic. So, not this option.

J: Low cost. Lower cost affects supply, not directly elasticity. Lower cost might make the product more affordable, but elasticity is about responsiveness to price, not cost. So, this probably doesn't make demand more elastic.

Now, looking at the options, I'm trying to find which factors make the elasticity higher.

Option B: Limited substitutes. If there are few substitutes, a price change will have a big impact on quantity. So, demand becomes more elastic.

Option C: Unique product. Also, without substitutes, any price change would make quantity more responsive. So, this would also make demand more elastic.

Wait, but option C is more about uniqueness. What's the difference between B and C?

Option B is about the number of substitutes. If there are a lot of substitutes, then consumers might switch to another product, making the demand less elastic. So, fewer substitutes (option B) would make demand more elastic.

Option C says the product is unique. Unique products don't have substitutes, so their price sensitivity is higher. So, that would also make demand more elastic.

But wait, the question is asking which makes the price elasticity greater. So, both B and C could contribute. But wait, in the options, B is about the number of substitutes being limited, and C is about the product being unique.

Alternatively, maybe C is a broader category. For example, a unique product is a subset of limited substitutes? Not exactly. Wait, the number of substitutes being limited means that when the price changes, consumers can easily switch to another product. If substitutes are limited, then the demand is more elastic. So, if you have a unique product, no substitutes, so that's another way to get higher elasticity.

So, which of these options is correct?

Looking again, the options are A to J, and the question is which option makes the demand more elastic.

So, which of these factors make demand more elastic.

Option B: Limited substitutes. So, if there are few substitutes, a change in price would lead to more substitution, hence higher elasticity.

Option C: Unique product. So, a product without substitutes is more elastic because any price change would have a significant impact.

Wait, but both B and C seem to be correct. But the options are separate.

Wait, the options are given as A to J, each as separate choices.

Looking at the options again:

B is about the number of substitutes limited. So, fewer substitutes would make demand more elastic.

C is about the product being unique with no substitutes. So, in that case, the product is unique, so any change in price would make that product the only one available, thus higher elasticity.

So, both B and C are correct. But the options are presented as single choices, and the question is which one.

Wait, the question says: The price elasticity of demand for a product is greater if.

So, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but looking at the options, each is a separate choice.

Wait, but the options are presented as A to J, so likely each option is a possible correct answer. But the question is asking which one makes it greater. So, multiple options may be correct, but the options are given as single choices, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is multiple-choice, and each option is a possible correct answer. So the correct options are the ones that make the demand more elastic.

So, let's go back.

Option C: If the product is unique and has no substitutes. So, if the product is unique, there are no substitutes. So, when the price changes, consumers can't find any other product to buy. So, the quantity demanded would be very responsive. So, demand is more elastic.

Option B: if the number of substitutes is limited. So, if there are few substitutes, then when price increases, consumers can switch to others, so demand is more elastic.

So, both B and C could make the price elasticity higher. But looking at the options, the question is asking which choice makes it greater. So, perhaps both are correct, but the options are given as A to J, each as separate options.

Wait, the question is phrased as "The price elasticity of demand for a product is greater if..." and the options are A to J.

So, each option is a possible reason. So, the correct answers are the ones that are true.

So, for example, if the product is a luxury (option H), then the demand is more elastic because luxury items are considered high-priced and have good substitutes, so the elasticity is high.

Wait, but H is about luxury. Luxury goods are considered to have more substitutes. So, if the product is a luxury, the elasticity is high.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if the product is unique, it's more elastic. So, which is more correct?

Hmm, perhaps H is correct because luxury goods have high elasticity because when price goes up, people buy more.

But let me think again.

The four options I'm considering are B and C.

Wait, the question is about the price elasticity. So, for each option, which factors contribute to higher elasticity.

Option C: If the product is unique, then any change in price would result in a high elasticity because there are no substitutes. So, this is correct.

Option B: Limited substitutes. For example, if there are only 2 substitutes, then the demand is more elastic. So, when the price increases, consumers can easily switch to another product, so quantity is highly responsive. So, this is correct.

So, both B and C could be correct, but perhaps in the options, both are present.

Wait, looking back at the options:

The options are:

A: Proportion in budget.

B: number of substitutes limited.

C: unique and no substitutes.

D: consumer income high.

E: short time to respond.

F: brand value high.

G: product is perishable.

H: luxury.

I: necessity.

J: low cost.

So, the question is asking which of these makes the demand more elastic.

So, for each option, is it a correct reason.

Option C: If the product is unique and has no substitutes, then any change in price would cause a very large change in quantity. So, yes, this makes demand more elastic.

Option B: Limited substitutes. So, if there are few substitutes, then any price change leads to a lot of substitution, so demand is more elastic.

So, both B and C are correct reasons.

But the options are separate, so the correct answers would be both B and C. But perhaps the answer expects only one correct option.

Wait, looking at the options, the question is looking for "the last character of your response must be the letter you’ve chosen."

Wait, so perhaps the correct options are a combination of B and C. But the options are given as separate letters, so I think the correct answer is both B and C, but the options are presented as separate letters, so perhaps the correct options are B and C.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the user must put one letter as the final answer.

But in the options, both B and C are correct. Let me see the options again.

Wait, perhaps the correct options are B and C, but the question's options are presented as a single letter. So, perhaps the correct answer is B and C. But the options are presented as A through J, each a separate possibility.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but the options are presented in a way that requires choosing all that apply. But since the user is asking to choose one, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me reevaluate.

The question is asking which of the following makes the price elasticity greater.

So, for each option, decide if it makes demand more elastic.

So:

A: Proportional budget is high → not directly about elasticity. It affects budget share but not elasticity.

B: Limited substitutes → yes, as in when there are few substitutes, quantity changes more with price.

C: Unique product with no substitutes → yes, any change in price leads to more substitution, so higher elasticity.

So, both B and C are correct.

But the options are presented as individual letters, so the user must select all that apply. But the question is presented as a single answer. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. The question is whether the product is unique, which is a subset of limited substitutes. If the product is unique, then there are no substitutes at all, so it's a more specific case of limited substitutes. So, if the product is unique, then it's also limited substitutes, but the converse isn't true.

So, for the purpose of the question, both B and C are correct.

But perhaps the options are presented as where each option is a possible correct answer, and the answer is a letter that is correct.

But in the given options, B and C are both correct reasons. So, perhaps the correct options are B and C.

But the options are presented as separate letters, so perhaps the correct answers are B and C.

Wait, but the options are given as the choices, so the correct answer must be the letter(s) that are correct.

Wait, but the user says, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, perhaps the correct answer is just the letter for the correct option.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the options (A-J) makes the demand more elastic, and each is a possible correct answer.

So, in that case, the correct answers are B and C. But the options are presented as single letters, so perhaps the answer expects both, but I can't select multiple letters.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering C. Unique products are a subset of limited substitutes, but not the same. So, for example, a unique product has zero substitutes, so the number of substitutes is zero, which is a subset of limited substitutes (number less than 5, say). So, in that case, if the number of substitutes is limited (say, 2 or 3), the product is unique. So, both B and C are correct.

But looking back, perhaps the correct answer is B and C, but the options are presented as separate letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both options B and C. But the options are presented as multiple-choice, each with a single letter. So, perhaps the correct options are B and C, but the way the question is phrased, the correct ones are B and C.

Wait, the problem is that I can't select multiple letters in this format. So, perhaps I need to determine which of the options A to H make the demand more elastic.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option B: number of substitutes is limited. So, lower number of substitutes → more elastic.

Option C: product is unique with no substitutes. So, unique → no substitutes → more elastic.

So, both B and C are correct. So, which of these is the answer?

But the options are each a separate letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but I'm supposed to select the correct letter(s). But in the given format, each option is a single letter, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but I can select two letters.

Wait, but the user is asking to put the final answer as a single letter. So, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but that's not possible because each letter is a single option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

In the options, the correct answers are B and C. So, the correct letter would be options B and C. But the options are presented as multiple-choice, each with a single letter. So, perhaps the correct letter is B and C, but the way the question is structured, it's expecting to choose all correct letters, but the user instruction is to only put the final letter, so perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the options as follows:

Only option C is correct. Because unique products have no substitutes, thus making them very elastic. Option B is also correct because limited substitutes would increase elasticity.

Wait, but in the options, option C is "the product is unique and has no substitutes." So, that's a correct reason.

Option B is "the number of substitute products is limited." That's another correct reason.

So, both B and C are correct. But perhaps the options are presented as a single letter, so the correct answer is both B and C, but that's not possible in this format.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about which options are correct.

The question asks, "The price elasticity of demand for a product is greater if..." So, which of the options is true.

So, for example, when a product is a luxury, its own price elasticity is high. So, that's another reason. So, option H is correct.

Also, when a product is unique, it's even more elastic.

So, the correct options are B and C.

Wait, but perhaps the options are presented as separate letters, so the correct answer would be both B and C.

But in the problem, only one letter can be chosen. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option C is the correct answer because unique products have no substitutes, making them very elastic. Option B is also correct because limited substitutes would make demand more elastic.

But wait, perhaps the question is only looking for one correct option, but I'm told to choose all that are correct.

But the user's instruction is, "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but the letters are part of the response. But I can't select multiple letters in this format.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard factors affecting price elasticity.

I think that luxury goods are a good example, as their elasticity is high. So, if the product is a luxury (option H), then the correct answer is H.

But wait, the options are separate letters, so perhaps H is correct, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when the number of substitutes is limited, the product is more elastic.

So, the options are B and C.

But perhaps the correct answers are B and C.

Wait, but the options are presented as separate letters, so the correct answer is B and C. But the user can only select one letter.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is only C, because unique products have no substitutes, making them highly elastic.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is only B, because limited substitutes make it more elastic.

Wait, perhaps the correct options are both B and C. So, the correct letters are B and C. But since I can only choose one letter, perhaps the intended correct answer is both B and C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B and C. But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps looking at the options again.

Option C: product is unique and no substitutes. So, that's a subset of B. So, if a product is unique, it's also limited by substitutes, but not the other way around. So, for the purpose of the question, which options are correct.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to proceed with the answer being B and C, but I can only select one. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is only C because unique products have no substitutes, making them highly elastic.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B because limited substitutes make demand more responsive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is C and B.

But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended correct answer is both B and C, but that's not possible here.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm not really sure. Let me think again.

The question is: the price elasticity is greater if.

Looking at each option:

A: Proportional budget is high. Not directly related to elasticity.

B: Substitute products limited. So, more responsive.

C: Unique. So, more responsive.

D: Income high. Not directly.

E: Short time to respond. So, less elastic.

F: Brand. High elasticity.

G: Perishable. Low elasticity.

H: Luxury. High elasticity.

I: Necessity. Low elasticity.

J: Low cost. Not directly.

So, the correct options are B, C, H, and F.

But the question is presented as "The price elasticity of demand for a product is greater if...", so the correct answer is the option that states a factor that increases elasticity.

So, for each of these options, is the statement correct?

Option B: Correct. Limited substitutes make demand more elastic.

Option C: Correct. Unique product makes demand more elastic.

Option H: Correct. Luxury goods have high elasticity.

Option F: Correct. Luxury is high elasticity.

So, the correct options are B, C, H, F.

But the user expects only one letter as the final answer, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because unique products have no substitutes. If the product is unique, then any price change would have a significant impact on quantity. So, yes, it's correct.

Similarly, option B is correct because limited substitutes make quantity more responsive.

But the options are presented as separate letters, so the correct answer must be the letters that are correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is both B and C, but I can't select both.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B and C, but I'm to choose all that apply.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the answer as 'both B and C' but the options are given as separate letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 'B and C' but that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is only option C, as unique products have no substitutes, making them highly elastic.

Wait, but then why would limited substitutes also be correct.

I think I'll proceed with the answer being option C, but I'm not entirely sure.
</think>

To determine which factors make the price elasticity of demand greater, we analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Proportional budget is high. This relates to consumer spending but doesn't directly affect price elasticity.
- **Option B**: Limited substitutes. If there are few substitutes, consumers are more responsive to price changes, increasing elasticity.
- **Option C**: Unique product. A unique product has no substitutes, making it highly responsive to price changes, thus increasing elasticity.
- **Option D**: Consumer income high. Income affects demand, not elasticity.
- **Option E**: Short time to respond. A shorter time frame reduces responsiveness, decreasing elasticity.
- **Option F**: Product is a luxury. Luxury goods have high elasticity because consumers are more responsive to price changes.
- **Option G**: Product is perishable. Perishable products have limited substitutes, increasing elasticity.
- **Option H**: Luxury. Luxury goods have high elasticity.
- **Option I**: Necessity. Necessity has low elasticity.
- **Option J**: Low cost. Low cost affects supply, not elasticity.

The factors that make demand more elastic are **B** (limited substitutes), **C** (unique product), **F** (luxury), **G** (perishable), and **H** (luxury). However, since the question requires a single letter, the most accurate answer is **C** because a unique product inherently has no substitutes, maximizing price elasticity.

ANSWER: C
