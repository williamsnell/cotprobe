Okay, I need to solve this problem where ABC Trucking charges $0.084 per pound for transporting equipment. I have to find out how much it would cost to ship a 275-pound washing machine.

Hmm, let's think. The cost should be the price per pound multiplied by the weight. So, I'll calculate 0.084 multiplied by 275.

Wait, let me do the math step by step. 275 pounds times 0.084. Let's break it down. Maybe multiply 275 by 0.08 first. 275 * 0.08 is 22. So that's 22 cents. Then, 275 * 0.004 is 1.10. Adding those together, 22 + 1.10 equals 23.10. But wait, that's only 23.10 dollars. Let me double-check that calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should do it more accurately. 275 * 0.084. Let me consider that 0.084 is 84 thousandths. So, 275 * 84 thousandths. Let me compute 275 * 84 first. 275 * 80 is 22,000, and 275 * 4 is 1,100. Adding those gives 23,100. Since it's thousandths, I move the decimal three places to the left, making it 23.10. So the total is $23.10.

Looking at the options, option E is $23.10. That should be the answer.
