Alright, let's tackle this genetics problem. Hmm, the question is about heritability and variance components in guinea pig coat color. Okay, I remember from my studies that heritability refers to the proportion of variance in a particular trait that is due to genetic factors. 

So, the problem states that the total variance is 0.573. The inbreeding coefficient, I think, is the fraction of variance due to inbreeding. But wait, the question says that the heritability is 38% of the total variance. Oh right, heritability (h²) is the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be attributed to genetic variance. So h² is 0.38 here.

Wait, the question asks for (a) variance due to gene effect and (b) due to epistasis and dominance. Wait, wait, no, I think the question actually describes the heritability as the proportion of the total variance due to epistasis and dominance. Or does it? Wait, the question says, "from correlations between relatives in the randomly mating population the heritability was determined to be 38 percent of the total variance." So, heritability (h²) is 0.38. 

But wait, the question also says that the total variance was 0.573, and the inbreeding coefficient is 0.340. Hmm. So, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

Wait, the problem is about variance components. The total variance (V) is given as 0.573. The variance due to inbreeding (Vf) is calculated as the inbreeding coefficient multiplied by the total variance. Oh wait, no, I think the inbreeding coefficient is the fraction of genes that are homozygous. So, the formula is Vf = h² * V. But wait, if h² is the heritability, which is 38% of the total variance, then Vf would be h² * V. Let me check.

Wait, no, wait. The heritability (h²) is the proportion of variance due to genetic factors. So, Vg = h² * V, where Vg is the genetic variance. The remaining variance is due to other factors like epistasis, dominance, and environmental factors.

Wait, the problem says that from correlations between relatives, the heritability (gene effect) was determined to be 38% of the total variance. So, h² is 0.38. So, Vg = 0.38 * 0.573. Let me calculate that: 0.38 * 0.573. Hmm, 0.38 times 0.5 is 0.19, 0.38 times 0.073 is about 0.02774. So adding them gives approximately 0.21774. So that's part (a), variance due to gene effect is approximately 0.218. 

But wait, the options are given, so I'll need to look at the options for part (a). The options for (a) are A: 0.217, C: 0.218, etc. So, part (a) is 0.218.

Now, part (b) is the variance due to epistasis and dominance. Hmm, the total variance is V = 0.573. The variance due to inbreeding is Vf = h² * V. So Vf is 0.38 * 0.573 ≈ 0.2177. So the remaining variance (which would be Vg + Vep + Vdom) is 0.573 - 0.2177 = 0.3553.

Wait, but part (b) is the variance due to epistasis and dominance. So if the question is asking for the sum of these two, then it's 0.3553. Looking at the options, let's see what's available. 

The options are:

A: 0.217, 0.356 → So part (a) is 0.217, part (b) is 0.356.

C: 0.218, 0.015 → No, that's way too low.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Another approach: the variance due to epistasis and dominance would be the remaining variance after subtracting the variance due to inbreeding. So, Vg + Vep + Vdom = V - Vf. So Vg + (Vep + Vdom) = 0.573 - 0.2177 ≈ 0.3553.

But the question is phrased as (b) "variancedue toepistasisand dominance." So, is that adding them together, making it 0.3553? Looking at the options, option A for (a) is 0.217, and option A for (b) is 0.356. So that would match. 

Wait, but perhaps the question is more about the variance due to epistasis (Vep) and dominance (Vdom) as separate components. So they're asking for the sum of Vep and Vdom. So, the remaining part after inbreeding is 0.573 - 0.2177 = 0.3553, which would be the sum of Vep and Vdom. 

Wait, but 0.3553 is approximately 0.355. Let me check the options again. Option A is 0.356. So, if the question is asking for the sum (epistasis and dominance), then option A fits (a=0.217, b=0.356). 

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: (a) 0.217, (b) 0.356 → So 0.217 + 0.356 = 0.573. But that's the total variance. That doesn't make sense because part (a) is the variance due to gene effect, and the rest is due to other factors. So, the (b) part is 0.356, and the other is 0.217, which adds to 0.573. But the question is asking for the variance due to epistasis and dominance, which is 0.356, so option A's (b) is 0.356. 

But wait, looking again at the options, option A says (a) 0.217 and (b) 0.356. So, that would be correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the variance due to epistasis and dominance is not the sum but the specific part of that. But the question says, "variancedue toepistasisand dominance." That sounds like the sum. 

Wait, but another angle: If the heritability is only the variance due to epistasis and dominance, then the variance due to epistasis and dominance would be 0.38 (h²) times the total variance. But that can't be, because that would make Vep + Vdom = h² * V = 0.38 * 0.573 ≈ 0.21774. But that would make option A (b) 0.217 again, which is part (a). So that's conflicting.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me restate the problem. The question states that the heritability (h²) is 38% of the total variance. So, h² is 0.38. So, variance due to heritability is 0.38 * 0.573 ≈ 0.217. That's part (a). 

Then, the remaining variance (0.573 - 0.217 = 0.356) is due to other factors like epistasis and dominance. So the variance due to epistasis and dominance is 0.356. So option A's (b) is 0.356. That would make option A the correct choice for (a) and (b).

Looking at the options again, option A is (a) 0.217, (b) 0.356 → which matches.

Wait, but the options I'm looking at are options A through J, with each option having two numbers. So option A is (a=0.217, b=0.356). So that's the correct one. 

Hence, the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given data:

1. **Total variance (V):** 0.573  
2. **Heritability (h²):** 38% of the total variance, which is 0.38.  
3. **Variance due to inbreeding (Vf):** This is calculated as \( Vf = h² \times V \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   Vf = 0.38 \times 0.573 = 0.21774 \approx 0.218
   \]

4. **Variance due to epistasis and dominance (Vep + Vdom):**  
   This is the remaining variance after accounting for the inbreeding variance:  
   \[
   Vep + Vdom = V - Vf = 0.573 - 0.21774 = 0.35526 \approx 0.355
   \]

Now, we compare the calculated values with the given options:

- **Part (a):** Variance due to gene effect (h² × V) is approximately 0.218.  
- **Part (b):** Variance due to epistasis and dominance is approximately 0.355.  

Looking at the options, **option A** provides (a) 0.217 and (b) 0.356, which are the closest matches to the calculated values.
