Question:

What roles does glucose play in cellmetabolism ?

Options:

A: Glucose is only used for energy production in cells
B: Glucose is used in cells primarily to form cell wall components
C: Glucose is not used by cells but is instead excreted as waste
D: Glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen for storage, and can be converted into fat for storage.
E: Glucose is utilized exclusively for the synthesis of amino acids in cells
F: Glucose can only be stored as fat
G: Glucose serves only as a signaling molecule to regulate cellular functions
H: Glucose is only stored as glycogen in cells
I: Glucose is only used to produce nucleic acids in cells
J: Glucose is converted to protein directly within cells

Alright, so I'm looking at this question about glucose's role in cell metabolism. Okay, let me think through this step by step. I remember that glucose is a fundamental energy source for most cells. 

The question lists several options, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says glucose is only used for energy. That doesn't sound right. I know cells have various uses for glucose beyond just energy. Like, it can be for other processes too, like building cell walls or excreting as waste.

Option B says glucose is used mainly to form cell walls. I'm not sure about that. I remember that cell walls are made by other molecules like cellulases or proteins, maybe. So B might not be correct.

Option C claims glucose isn't used by cells but is excreted as waste. That doesn't make sense either. Cells use glucose for energy, and waste products are byproducts of metabolism, but not the primary source.

Option D states that glucose is the primary energy source, can be converted into glycogen and fat. That's a standard statement I've heard before. I think the body uses glucose as the main energy, and cells convert it into other forms like glucose-6-phosphate to glycogen for energy storage, and to fat for energy needs. So D seems correct.

Option E says glucose is only used for amino acid synthesis. Wait, I remember that amino acids are broken down into glucose and other nutrients, so E is probably wrong.

Option F: glucose can only be stored as fat. No, that's not right. Cells store glucose as glycogen, which is a longer chain form, not fat.

Option G: glucose is a signaling molecule. I don't recall that. I know that hormones like insulin and glucagon are involved, but glucose itself isn't a signaling molecule. So G is likely incorrect.

Option H: only used for producing nucleic acids. No, that's not true. Nucleic acids are synthesized from glucose via enzymes, so H is wrong.

Option I: only used to make proteins. No, that's not right. Proteins are made from amino acids, not directly from glucose. So I's incorrect.

Option J: glucose is converted to protein. No, that's not correct. I think it's made into amino acids which are then processed into proteins.

So reviewing, the correct statement is D. Glucose is the main energy source, can be converted into glycogen and fat for storage and energy. So the answer should be D.

The correct answer is D. Glucose is the primary energy source for most cells, and it can be converted into glycogen for storage and fat for energy needs. This is a well-established fact in cell metabolism.

Answer: D
