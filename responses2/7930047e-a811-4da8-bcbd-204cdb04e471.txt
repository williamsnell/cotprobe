Question:

A customer is suing a car dealer for selling him a salvaged vehicle that the car dealer had represented as being brand new. A few weeks before trial, the car dealer approached his sister and said, "Sis, I need some sympathy. I sold a salvaged vehicle to a customer, and now he's suing me. I didn't mean any harm by it. I inspected the vehicle and everything. " Unknown to either the car dealer or his sister, the sister's boyfriend was at the front door and overheard this conversation. When the time for trial came around, the car dealer left the country and refused to attend the trial, telling his attorney to handle it. The customer's attorney attempted several times to secure the car dealer's attendance at trial, but was unsuccessful. At trial, the sister's boyfriend is called to testify about the conversation he overheard. On objection by the car dealer's attorney, the court will most likely rule the testimony

Okay, so I'm looking at this legal question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The situation is about a customer suing a car dealer for selling a salvaged vehicle. The dealer, before the trial, approached his sister and said he sold a salvaged vehicle to someone and that person is suing him. The dealer inspected the vehicle and said it wasn't harmful. The sister's boyfriend at the time heard this conversation. After the trial, the dealer left the country and didn't attend. The customer's attorney tried to get the dealer to appear but failed. Now, the sister's boyfriend is called to testify about the conversation, and the dealer's attorney asked why he didn't attend trial. The question is about whether the testimony is admissible.

So, the options are A to J, and I need to pick which one is correct. Let me think about the hearsay rule here. Hearsay is when a statement is made by someone other than the party in the case, and it's not made with the intent to establish its truth for the purpose of the case. But there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, like the statement of fact exception, which allows statements made under oath, declarations of fact that are clear and unambiguous, declarations against interest, declarations against liability, and declarations against harm. There's also the excited utterance exception and the availability exception.

Looking at the situation, the dealer's attorney tried to get him to appear, but he said he didn't mean any harm. The dealer inspected the vehicle and said it was clean. The sister's boyfriend is trying to testify about this conversation. The dealer didn't attend trial, but now he's being called.

So, what's the nature of the statement? It's about what the dealer said when the sister's boyfriend heard the conversation. The dealer's attorney is objecting because he didn't mean any harm. But the dealer didn't make any mistake, just a statement.

Wait, the dealer's attorney is objecting, so the dealer is being called, but the claim is about the statement he made. But wait, the question is about whether the statement is admissible. So, let's see.

The dealer's statement is a statement of fact. It's about what he said in a conversation. He made it under the circumstances, without intending to harm. So, is this a valid statement under any exception?

The statement of fact exception requires the statement to be clear and unambiguous, and that the declarer (the party making the statement) intended to establish the truth for the purpose of the case. Here, the dealer made the statement without any claim of harm, so he might have intended to establish that he sold a salvaged vehicle without harm. But is it clear and unambiguous? The dealer inspected the vehicle and said it was clean, so the statement seems clear. So, is it a valid statement under the statement of fact exception?

Alternatively, the dealer's attorney tried to get him to appear, but he didn't, so the court has to consider whether the statement is admissible even if the declarer didn't appear.

Wait, but the dealer's attorney is objecting, so he's not allowed to present evidence. So the statement might be hearsay because the dealer made it, and the witness is the declarer. But if the statement is clear and unambiguous, maybe it's admissible under the statement of fact exception.

But wait, the dealer's attorney is objecting. So does that affect the admissibility? Hearsay exceptions are about the statement's nature, not about the declarer's intent. So the dealer's attorney's objection might be a defense, but it's not part of the statement itself. So the statement is still hearsay unless an exception applies.

So the key is whether the statement is admissible. Since the dealer made it in a way that doesn't indicate any intent, and the statement is clear and unambiguous, perhaps it's admissible as a statement of fact under the statement of intent exception. But wait, the dealer didn't intend any harm, but he might have intended to establish that the vehicle was salvaged without any issue. So the statement is about the dealer's actions, which are under the circumstances, but without any indication of intent beyond what the facts show.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is admissible as a statement of fact because it's clear. So the dealer's attorney's objection might be a defense, but it's not an exception. So the statement is admissible as a statement of fact because the facts are clear and unambiguous.

Alternatively, the statement is hearsay because the dealer's attorney is objecting. But if the statement is clear and unambiguous, the exception might apply. Or maybe the statement is hearsay because the declarer didn't appear, but the fact that he didn't appear is a defense.

Wait, but the dealer didn't make the statement. He made it about what he did. So the statement is about the dealer's actions, which he did. So it's a statement by the declarer, so it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

So, the statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. Since the statement is clear and unambiguous, perhaps it's admissible as a statement of fact under the statement of fact exception.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Hearsay requires the statement to be made by someone other than the party in the case, and it's not made with the intent to establish the truth for the purpose of the case.

In this case, the dealer made the statement. The customer's attorney is objecting because the dealer's attorney isn't present. So, the statement is hearsay because the dealer is the declarer. But the statement is clear and unambiguous, so under the statement of fact exception, it's admissible.

Wait, but the dealer's attorney tried to get him to appear but failed. So the court could object on hearsay grounds, but the exception applies if the statement is clear and unambiguous. So the dealer's statement is admissible as a statement of fact.

Wait, but the dealer's attorney asked why he didn't attend trial. So perhaps the court is considering whether the statement is hearsay because the declarer didn't appear. But the statement is under a hearsay exception if it's clear and unambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is not admissible because the dealer's attorney is objecting, which is a defense, so the exception doesn't come into play. So the statement is hearsay and thus inadmissible.

Wait, but no. The statement is made by the declarer. So unless an exception applies, the statement is hearsay.

So, the dealer's statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. Since the statement is clear and unambiguous, the statement of fact exception applies. So the statement is admissible as a statement of fact.

Wait, but the dealer's attorney is trying to get him to appear. So if the court rules that the statement is admissible, then the statement is not hearsay. But if the court objects because the declarer didn't appear, the statement is not hearsay. So I'm getting confused.

Wait, the statement is hearsay because it's being made by the declarer. But if the statement is clear and unambiguous, then it's admissible as a statement of fact under the statement of fact exception.

So the answer would be A: admissible as a statement of intent. Wait, no, the statement is about what the dealer said, not about intent. So option A is about statement of intent, which doesn't fit here.

Wait, the dealer's attorney is objecting, so the court may not grant the testimony. But if the statement is admissible as a statement of fact, then the court would grant it.

Wait, but let me think about the excited utterance exception. That happens when a statement is made under oath, but that's not the case here. The dealer's attorney is objecting, so he's not present.

So, the statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. Since the statement is clear and unambiguous, the statement of fact exception applies. So the statement is admissible as a statement of fact.

Wait, but the dealer's statement is a declaration against interest. Or is it a declaration against harm? The dealer inspected the vehicle and said it was brand new. So, he said it was new, so perhaps he intended to sell it as new. But the dealer's intent isn't about harm but about the condition of the vehicle. So, maybe it's a declaration against interest.

Wait, no, the statement is about what he did, not about his intentions. So the statement is about his actions, which he made without any intent beyond what the facts show.

So, the statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. Since it's clear and unambiguous, the statement is admissible as a statement of fact.

Wait, but the dealer's attorney is objecting, so that would be a hearsay exception. So I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to recall: hearsay exceptions include statement of fact, declaration against interest, etc.

The dealer's statement is a clear and unambiguous declaration. So it's admissible as a statement of fact. But the dealer's attorney is objecting, which is a defense. So the statement is admissible as a statement of fact under the statement of fact exception.

Wait, but is the statement about the intent? No, it's about the facts. So the correct exception would be statement of fact, which is option A: admissible as a statement of intent. Wait, no, option A is statement of intent. Option D is statement of present sense impression.

Wait, another angle: the dealer's statement is a declaration against interest. So the statement is about what he did in a way that would protect his interest. So, it's a statement of fact, because it's about the facts, not his intentions. So, it's admissible as a statement of fact under the statement of fact exception.

But the dealer's attorney is objecting, which would be a hearsay exception. Wait, so the exception is applied regardless of the attorney's objection. So, the statement is admissible as a statement of fact because it's clear and unambiguous, so option A is admissible as a statement of intent. No, option A is admissible as a statement of fact, which is correct.

Wait, but the statement is about the dealer's actions, which is a statement of fact. So the correct exception is statement of fact. So the court would rule the statement admissible under the statement of fact exception, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The statement is a declaration against interest. So it's a declaration against interest, which is an exception under hearsay. So the court would rule it admissible under that exception. So, the correct answer would be D: admissible as a statement of present sense impression.

Wait, no, the statement is about the dealer's actions, which is a declaration against interest, which is an exception for declarations against interest. So, the court would allow the statement because it's a declaration against interest.

Wait, but the dealer's statement is clear and unambiguous, so the statement of fact exception applies. So the answer would be A: admissible as a statement of fact. Or D?

Wait, no, the statement of fact exception is about making a declaration that is clear and unambiguous. So, the dealer's statement is clear, so the exception applies. Therefore, the statement is admissible as a statement of fact, which is option A.

But I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think of another angle. If the statement is made by the declarer, and it's clear, then the statement is admissible as a statement of fact under the statement of fact exception. So, the court would rule it admissible, and the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but the dealer's attorney is objecting, which is a defense to the statement. So the exception applies, and the court would grant the testimony. So the correct answer is A: admissible as a statement of fact.

Wait, but I thought the excited utterance exception was when the statement is made under oath. Here, it's not. So the excited utterance exception doesn't apply. So the correct exception is statement of fact.

So, the answer is A: admissible as a statement of fact.

Wait, but then the dealer's attorney is objecting, which is a defense. So, the statement is admissible under the statement of fact exception. So the court would grant the testimony.

So, the answer is A: admissible as a statement of fact.

The question revolves around whether a statement made by a dealer, which the dealer's attorney attempted to refute, is admissible under the hearsay rule. The dealer's statement is clear and unambiguous, and it does not involve any intent beyond what the facts reveal. The statement is made by the declarer (the dealer) and is not made under oath, so the statement of fact exception applies. The dealer's attorney's objection is a defense, but the statement is still admissible as a statement of fact under the exception. 

The excited utterance exception and the availability exception do not apply here. The statement is clear and unambiguous, making it admissible as a statement of fact. 

ANSWER: A
