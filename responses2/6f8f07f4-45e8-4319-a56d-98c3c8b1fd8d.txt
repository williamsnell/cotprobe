B: 1750 mph
C: 1320 mph
D: 1200 mph
E: 1800 mph
F: 1650 mph

Okay, so I've got this question about the speed of a jet plane based on the Mach number. Hmm, I remember that Mach number is a measure of how fast something is going compared to the speed of sound. Oh wait, right, the speed of sound at sea level is given as about 750 miles per hour. So if the plane is moving at Mach 2.2, that means it's going 2.2 times the speed of sound.

Wait, let me think. So if the speed of sound is 750 mph, then multiplying that by the Mach number should give me the speed of the jet. So 2.2 times 750. Let me calculate that. 2 * 750 is 1500, and 0.2 *750 is 150. So adding them together, 1500 + 150 equals 1650 mph. So the speed is 1650 mph.

Looking at the options, the choices are A through J. So let me check. Option F is 1650 mph. Oh, yes, that's exactly what I got. So the right answer should be F.

The speed of the jet plane at Mach 2.2 is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound (750 mph) by the Mach number (2.2), resulting in 1650 mph. The correct option is F.

Answer: F
