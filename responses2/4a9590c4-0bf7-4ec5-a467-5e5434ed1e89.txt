Okay, so I'm faced with this question about ethical psychology and how to handle a situation where a person wants therapy based on their political views. Hmm, let me break this down.

Alright, the scenario is that Hermann, who's 28, is really unhappy because of his breakup and he wants to start therapy with me. The first session is when I find out his political views are completely repugnant to me. I'm an ethical psychologist, so I need to decide the best way to handle this.

I remember that ethical psychology often emphasizes respecting the patient's autonomy and making informed decisions. So, the key here is not just about what's right from the patient's perspective but also about respecting their right to make their own choices.

Let me read the options again:

Option A: Discuss discomfort in the first session. That's probably too early. It could lead to a negative interaction if he's uncomfortable, but maybe too soon for a sensitive issue.

Option B: Ignore personal feelings and continue without discussing. I'm not sure. Even if he's unhappy, if I don't address the political views, he might not realize the impact. It's possible that he's aware but feels it's off-limits, so maybe ignoring it is better.

Option C: Discuss political views only if they become relevant during psychotherapy. That seems reasonable. Until the issue is crucial in the treatment plan, discussing his views might be premature. Therapy can help him process and understand his feelings, so discussing early might be better.

Option D: Suggest him find a psychologist with his political views. That sounds like an intervention. But Hermann is unhappy; suggesting another psychologist might not be appropriate unless he has a valid reason. I'm not sure if that's ethical here.

Option E: Decline therapy because of differences. If I decline, he might feel worse, which could be bad. It's better to address his feelings first before making a decision.

Option F: See him in therapy until crisis ends, then refer. That's a proactive approach. Therapies can help him manage the situation and find a way to move forward, which might be better than refusing early.

Option G: Tell him his views are repugnant and continue. That's a clear action, but is it appropriate? He's unhappy, so telling him outright might make him feel worse, which isn't good for him. Maybe not ideal.

Option H: Offer only if he changes views. But I'm not sure why he would change. If he's stuck on his political views, maybe it's better to let it go.

Option I: Referrals. That's more about external help, but I don't think that's part of the decision-making here.

So, thinking about the ethical implications: I should respect his rights to make his own decisions. Discussing his views early (option C) could help him understand them better and process his feelings. Therapy can also provide him with tools to manage his anxiety or frustration without being forced to listen to his political stance. If I decline (option E), he might not feel better, and it could escalate his situation. On the other hand, if I continue (G), he might feel more comfortable, but his feelings are strong, so that could make him worse. 

If I offer him referrals (I), that's an external help, but it's not part of the decision. So maybe that's not the best approach.

Between C and F: C suggests discussing until relevant, which makes sense. F is about waiting until crisis is over, which might not be feasible. F could be a proactive approach but might be more about waiting, which isn't the best for him.

Alternatively, H is offering only if he changes, which isn't helpful because he's unhappy. So, H might not be a good option.

So, the best approach is to discuss his political views early in the session if they're relevant to the psychotherapy. That way, he can process his feelings and the views are part of the therapy process. So, option C seems correct.

The appropriate approach is to discuss Hermann's political views in the first session if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process. This allows him to process his feelings and views as part of the therapy, ensuring he feels heard and understood.
