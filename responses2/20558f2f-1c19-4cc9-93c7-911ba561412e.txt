Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about a proton falling from rest near the Earth and converting its gravitational potential energy into the energy of a single photon. I need to find the frequency of that photon. The options are given from A to J, each with a different frequency value. 

Hmm. So first, I should probably recall the relevant formulas. I remember that gravitational potential energy (PE) is mgh, and the kinetic energy (KE) when it hits the Earth would be that potential energy. But wait, since the proton is far away initially, the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it falls. 

Wait, but wait: the Earth is a massive object, so the gravitational potential energy is mgh, where h is the height the proton falls. But since it falls a long way away, h is quite large. Oh wait, but no, that's not right. The question says it's falling under Earth's gravity, but it's a proton, which is a very light particle. So the potential energy change is mgh where h is the distance it falls. 

Wait, but the potential energy (PE) is given by mgh. When the proton falls, this PE is converted into kinetic energy (KE). So the KE would be (1/2)mv², and when it hits the Earth, all the KE is converted into a photon's energy. So the photon's energy E equals KE.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the kinetic energy would be the work done by gravity, which is mgh. So E_photon = mgh. But another approach: when a particle falls from rest, the gravitational potential energy change is m g h, and equals the kinetic energy, which is (1/2) m v². So maybe I can find the velocity at the Earth's surface, then find the kinetic energy, which would be the energy of the photon.

But wait, maybe I should think about the gravitational potential energy relative to the Earth's surface. Let me think about the potential energy when the proton is very far away. At infinity, the potential energy is zero, so the proton's initial potential energy is mgh, where h is the height it falls. Then, when it hits the Earth, its potential energy is approximately -m g R (since at the surface, it's R distance from the center, so PE is -m g R), and the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². 

Wait, wait, but the gravitational potential energy (U) is U = - (G M_e m)/(r), where r is the distance from the center. So, when the proton is far away, r is much larger than Earth's radius (which is about 6.4e6 meters), so U approaches zero. So when it falls, it converts that potential energy into kinetic energy. 

So the change in potential energy is U_initial - U_final = - (G M_e m) / (R + h) - [ - (G M_e m)/ R ] = (G M_e m)(1/R - 1/(R + h)).

But since h is large, maybe I can approximate h as being much larger than R. Then, 1/(R + h) ≈ 1/R * (1 - h/(R)). So 1/R - 1/(R + h) ≈ 1/R [1 - (1 - h/(R)))] = 1/R (h/R) )= h / R². So the change in potential energy is approximately (G M_e m) * h / R². 

Wait, but when the proton falls a distance h, it's moving from infinity (U=0) to the Earth's surface (U=-m g R, but maybe I should use the formula). Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the potential energy change as m g h. 

Wait, wait, actually, let me clarify. The gravitational potential energy at a height h above the Earth's surface is U = - m g h (I think this is assuming that U=0 at the surface). Alternatively, when you're at height h above Earth's surface, the potential energy relative to the Earth's surface is U = - m g h. So the change in potential energy when the proton falls from infinity (U=0) to height h would be ΔU = - m g h. 

But wait, when the proton falls under gravity, its potential energy decreases by m g h. So the kinetic energy gained is m g h. 

So that KE = m g h. 

But wait, another approach: the gravitational potential energy near Earth's surface is U = m g h. So when the proton falls a distance h, its gain in kinetic energy is m g h. 

So the photon's energy E is m g h. 

Now, the energy of a photon is E = h f, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. So f = E / h.

But wait, I'm getting confused because I'm not sure about the exact value of h. The question says the proton falls from a distance "far away" but doesn't give any numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the proton falls a distance h which is equal to the radius of the Earth, R. Because sometimes in problems like this, h is taken as the Earth's radius. Let me think: if the proton falls a distance h equal to the Earth's radius, that would make sense. 

So h = R = 6.4e6 meters. 

But in that case, the gravitational potential energy change would be m g R, and the kinetic energy would be m g R. Then, that energy would equate to the photon's energy. 

Wait, but I should make sure about the exact setup. Alternatively, maybe the question is saying that the proton falls a significant distance, but the exact calculation will take into account the gravitational potential energy loss. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the gravitational potential energy near Earth's surface, which would be U = m g h, with h as the height. But since the proton is moving from a very high point, maybe h is considered to be equal to the Earth's radius. 

Another thought: perhaps we can use the escape velocity formula. The escape velocity from Earth is v_esc = sqrt(2 G M_e / R). And the kinetic energy of a projectile escaping would be (1/2) m v_esc². 

Wait, wait. Let's compute that. 

Escape velocity: v_esc = sqrt(2 G M_e / R). So KE at escape is (1/2) m (2 G M_e / R) = m G M_e / R. 

That would be the kinetic energy when the proton is at the Earth's surface and has escaped. But in our case, the proton is falling from a high point, so perhaps it's not escaping, but just falling a certain distance. So the kinetic energy when it hits the Earth's surface is less than the escape kinetic energy. 

Wait, but the problem states that after falling, the proton's kinetic energy is converted into the energy of a single photon. So the total energy is the photon's energy. So E_photon = (1/2) m v². 

But without knowing the height h, how can I calculate this? Oh wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the proton falls from an extremely high point, such that h is equal to the Earth's radius. Because that's a standard setup in these problems. For example, in the problem where a satellite is in orbit, the potential energy is considered relative to the Earth's surface. 

Wait, but in the case of a satellite, the potential energy is taken as U = - (G M_e m) / R. So if the satellite is at height h above Earth's surface, its potential energy is U = - (G M_e m) ( R / (R + h) ) ≈ - (G M_e m)/ R (1 - h/R) ) ≈ - (G M_e m)/ R + ( G M_e m h ) / R². So the change in potential energy is (G M_e m)/ R² * h. 

In that scenario, the kinetic energy is (G M_e m h) / R². So if the satellite is in circular orbit, the kinetic energy is (G M_e m h )/( 2 R² ). 

But the problem here is about a proton falling from rest. So perhaps I can model it similar to a satellite. Alternatively, perhaps the height h is equal to the Earth's radius, R. 

Wait, but when the proton falls a distance h = R, the gravitational potential energy change would be m g R. So KE = m g R. 

So E_photon = m g R. 

Now, the frequency f is given by E = h f. So f = E / h. 

Wait, but what are the units here? Let me think. 

The gravitational acceleration near Earth's surface is about 9.8 m/s². So g = 9.8 m/s². 

So E_photon = m g R.

Wait, but the mass of the proton is m = 1.67e-27 kg. 

So E = (1.67e-27 kg) * (9.8 m/s²) * (6.4e6 m) 

Let me compute that. 

Compute m g R: 

m g R = 1.67e-27 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 6.4e6 m 

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 1.67e-27 * 9.8 = approx 1.64e-26.

Then, 1.64e-26 * 6.4e6 = (1.64 * 6.4) * 1e(-26 +6) )= approx 10.496e-20 = 1.05e-19 J.

So energy E_photon ≈ 1.05e-19 J.

Then, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

So f = E_photon / h = (1.05e-19 J) / (6.626e-34 J·s) = (1.05 / 6.626) * 1e(15) ≈ approx 0.1587 * 1e15 ≈ 1.587e14 Hz.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.6e14, which is close to this. So the frequency would be around 1.587e14, which is option G.

But wait, option G is 1.6e14, which is about 1.6 × 10^14. So that's the closest option. 

Alternatively, perhaps the height h is not R but h = 6.4e6 m (the Earth's radius). Or perhaps the question is considering the potential energy from h = R. 

Wait, another approach: the potential energy near Earth's surface is considered as U = m g h. So h is the height the proton falls. If the proton falls a distance h, then the change in potential energy is m g h, which equals the kinetic energy.

So the photon's energy would be E = m g h.

But let me think about the gravitational potential energy near the Earth's surface. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the proton falling from a very high point, and the potential energy loss is m g R, so E = m g R. 

Wait, but I think I should compute it correctly. Let me recheck the numbers.

E = m g R = (1.67e-27 kg) * (9.8 m/s²) * (6.4e6 m) 

Let me compute each step:

1.67e-27 kg * 9.8 m/s² = (1.67 *9.8 )e-27 = approx 16.366e-27 kg·m/s² = 1.6366e-26 J.

Then, multiply by 6.4e6 m: 1.6366e-26 * 6.4e6 = 

1.6366 *6.4 = approx 10.46.

So 10.46e-20 J = 1.046e-19 J.

So E = 1.046e-19 J.

Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So f = E / h = (1.046e-19) / (6.626e-34) = (1.046 / 6.626) * 1e15 ≈ 0.158 * 1e15 = 1.58e14 Hz. 

Which is approximately 1.6e14, so option G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the conversion of gravitational potential energy (PE) into the energy of a photon. The proton falls from rest near the Earth, converting its gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy (KE). When it reaches the Earth, all KE is converted into the photon's energy. The energy of the photon is related to its frequency by the equation \( E = h f \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant.

### Key Steps:
1. **Gravitational Potential Energy (PE):**  
   The potential energy change is approximately \( \Delta U = m g R \), where \( m \) is the proton's mass, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( R \) is the Earth's radius. Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta U = (1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \times (9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2) \times (6.4 \times 10^6 \, \text{m})
   \]  
   Calculating this gives:  
   \[
   \Delta U \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Photon Energy:**  
   The energy of the photon is equal to the proton's kinetic energy at Earth's surface, \( E = \Delta U \). Thus,  
   \[
   E = 1.05 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Frequency of the Photon:**  
   Using \( E = h f \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we solve for \( f \):  
   \[
   f = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-19}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying this gives:  
   \[
   f \approx 1.587 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options:**  
   Among the given options, the closest value to \( 1.587 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \) is \( 1.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \), which corresponds to option G.

### Conclusion:
The frequency of the photon is approximately \( 1.587 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \), making the correct answer **G: \( 1.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{sec}^{-1} \)**.
