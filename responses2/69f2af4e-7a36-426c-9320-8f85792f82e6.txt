Okay, so I have this question about the benefits of exercise in people with diabetes. The options are A to G, and I need to find which one isn't a good effect. Let me think through each option.

First, I remember that diabetes affects insulin sensitivity and blood sugar levels. Exercise is supposed to improve things related to blood sugar. Like, it lowers blood sugar, which makes sense because when you exercise, your body uses glucose from food, which helps the pancreas get rid of it, leading to lower blood sugar.

Looking at the options:

A: Decreased muscle mass. Hmm, does exercise increase muscle mass? I think exercise can enhance muscular function, maybe improve strength and endurance, but I'm not sure if it directly decreases muscle mass. Or maybe it's the opposite? I'm a bit confused here. I think muscle mass is more about factors like genetics and diet, but maybe some exercises like weightlifting can increase it. But I'm not certain.

B: Impaired digestion. That sounds like it's the opposite of what I thought. With diabetes, high blood sugar from food can lead to hyperglycemia, which might cause digestive issues. So maybe exercise doesn't impair digestion, but helps manage blood sugar, which could lower blood sugar levels, making it harder to digest. So this might not be a beneficial effect.

C: Worsening of vision. I don't think exercise helps with vision. It's more about physical health. So this might not be a correct answer either.

D: Increase in blood sugar levels. Yes, exercise lowers blood sugar, so this is a beneficial effect. So D is not the correct answer.

E: Reduction of bone density. I remember that exercise can improve bone density because it increases muscle mass, which in turn releases calcium more efficiently. So E is a beneficial effect, so E is not the correct answer.

F: Increase in body fat percentage. Wait, that's counterintuitive. If exercise helps lower blood sugar, which might help manage diabetes, but I thought exercise can actually increase body fat. Or does it? I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's because exercise releases fat stores? Or perhaps it's not a direct effect. I'm not sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

G: Hypoglycaemia. No, that's the opposite of what exercise helps. It would make blood sugar higher, not lower. So G is not a beneficial effect.

Wait, let's go back to B and F. The question is which is NOT a beneficial effect. So the options are:

The question is asking for the effect that is NOT beneficial. So I need to find the one that's not achieved by exercise.

So options: B is impaired digestion. If exercise helps manage blood sugar, perhaps the body can't digest better. So impaired digestion would be bad, meaning B is a beneficial effect. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Impaired digestion is bad, so it's not a beneficial effect. So the effect that is not good would be impaired digestion.

Wait, but according to the question, the correct answer is the one that's not beneficial. So which option is not a positive result of exercise in people with diabetes.

Let me check each option again:

A: Decreased muscle mass. I'm not sure. Maybe it's an effect of other factors, or maybe some exercises can increase muscle mass. Hmm.

B: Impaired digestion. That's probably not a positive effect. So B is not a beneficial effect.

C: Worsening of vision. That's incorrect, so not a good answer.

D: Increase blood sugar. Yes, it's a positive effect.

E: Reduction in bone density. Yes, it's a positive effect.

F: Increase in body fat. I'm not sure. I thought exercise can increase body fat, but maybe it's more about muscle gain. Alternatively, high blood sugar from diabetes might help with weight loss, so maybe it's a positive effect. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

G: Hypoglycaemia. That's bad, so not a good effect.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a beneficial effect. So the options that are not beneficial are B, C, F, G.

Wait, the answer options are A to G, and the question is which is not a beneficial effect. So the correct answer would be B, C, F, or G.

Wait, the question is asking which is not a beneficial effect. So the incorrect effect is B (impaired digestion). Because exercise actually lowers blood sugar, which can make the body worse at digesting food. So impaired digestion is not a beneficial effect.

Wait, but wait a second. When you exercise, your body metabolizes the food you eat, which lowers blood sugar. So high blood sugar from diabetes can make it harder to digest properly. So impaired digestion (B) would be a negative effect. So B is not a beneficial effect.

So the question is which is not a beneficial effect. So the answer would be B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about F, which says increase in body fat. I thought that exercise can increase body fat, but maybe in the context of diabetes, it's not as direct. Alternatively, some people might gain weight through exercise, but that's a different effect. However, the question is about diabetes. So perhaps F is not a beneficial effect.

Wait, I'm getting a little stuck. Let me try to think again.

The options are:

A: Decreased muscle mass. Not sure.

B: Impaired digestion. Not a beneficial effect.

C: Worsening of vision. Wrong.

D: Increase in blood sugar. Yes.

E: Reduction of bone density. Yes.

F: Increase in body fat. Maybe not a good effect.

G: Hypoglycaemia. No.

So the question is which is not a beneficial effect.

Looking at the options, the question is asking which is NOT a beneficial effect. So the wrong answer is which one isn't beneficial.

So the not-beneficial options would be B, C, F, G.

Wait, but the question asks for the one that's not a beneficial effect, so the correct answer must be the one that's not helpful.

Wait, but let me think about each option again.

Option B: impaired digestion. I don't think exercise helps with that. Because exercise lowers blood sugar, which can make it harder to digest. So impaired digestion (bad) is not a beneficial effect. So B is the correct answer to the question.

Alternatively, F: increase in body fat. I'm not sure. Maybe some exercises cause fat gain, but in the context of diabetes, perhaps it's not a common or beneficial effect. So F could be the answer, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question is about diabetes. So perhaps the effects are more related to managing blood sugar, muscle, bone, etc.

So B is impaired digestion— exercise makes blood sugar lower, leading to poor digestion. So impaired digestion is bad, so B is not a beneficial effect.

Wait, but I thought that exercise can help with weight loss, which might help in managing diabetes. So if someone is losing weight, they might have less body fat. But the question is about increased body fat. So maybe F isn't a good effect.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to list all the options as possible correct answers and see which is the one not beneficial.

The correct question is which is not a beneficial effect.

So:

- A: Decreased muscle mass. Not sure if exercise decreases muscle mass. Maybe it's more about strength rather than mass. Or perhaps muscle mass can be increased through exercise. So A might be a beneficial effect.

- B: Impaired digestion. No, exercise lowers blood sugar, making it hard to digest. So B is a bad effect, so not a beneficial one. So B is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is which is not a beneficial effect. So B is not a positive result, so it's the answer.

The other options: D, E, G are positive effects. F is not clear, but perhaps it's not a positive effect either.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think again.

The question is about diabetes, so the focus is on diabetes-related effects. So:

A: Decreased muscle mass. Maybe not directly related to diabetes, but some exercises can increase muscle mass. So it's possible that exercise might have a beneficial effect on muscle mass. So A could be a positive effect, but the question is about which is not.

B: Impaired digestion. So exercise lowers blood sugar, which is bad for digestion. So B is a negative effect, so not a beneficial one.

C: Worsening of vision. Definitely not helpful.

D: Increased blood sugar. Yes, beneficial.

E: Reduced bone density. Yes, beneficial.

F: Increased body fat. I'm not certain, but maybe exercise can increase body fat, but maybe in the context of diabetes, it's not a major effect. Alternatively, maybe the answer is F.

G: Hypoglycaemia. That's the opposite of what exercise helps, so it's not a beneficial effect.

So the options that are not beneficial are B, C, F, G.

But the question is asking which is not a beneficial effect. So the answer could be B, C, F, or G.

Wait, but the question is which is not a beneficial effect. So the correct answer is the one that the question is looking for.

Looking back, the question is: "Which of the following is not a beneficial effect of exercise in people with diabetes?"

The options are A to G, and I need to pick the one that is not good.

So the options that are not beneficial are:

B: impaired digestion → Not good.

C: Worsening of vision → Not good.

F: Increase in body fat → Maybe not a good effect.

G: Hypoglycaemia → No.

So the question is which one is not a beneficial effect.

Wait, but the question is asking for which is not a beneficial effect. So the correct answer is the one that is not a positive outcome.

So the options that are positive effects are D, E, and G. The ones that are not are B, C, F.

But the question is multiple-choice, and the options are from A to G, each being a possible answer.

The correct answer is B, C, F, or G. But looking at the options, the choices are four letters, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's think again about each option:

Option B: Impaired digestion. So exercise lowers blood sugar, which makes it harder to digest. So impaired digestion is not a positive effect. So it's a negative one, so it's not a beneficial effect.

Option C: Worsening of vision. Definitely not helpful. Not a beneficial effect.

Option F: Increase in body fat. I think exercise can cause weight gain, but it's not directly related to diabetes. However, perhaps the question is considering the effect on body fat as a side effect. Alternatively, maybe the answer is F because it's a negative effect.

Wait, but the question is about diabetes, so the effects should be diabetes-related. So F could be a non-diabetes effect, so perhaps not the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the effect of exercise on blood sugar levels. Then, F is bad.

Wait, the question is about beneficial effects. So the correct answer is B, C, F, or G.

But let me think again about the options.

The question is: Which of the following is not a beneficial effect.

So, the options that are harmful are B, C, F, G.

But the question is looking for the option that is not a beneficial effect, so among the options, which is incorrect.

Wait, but let me think about each option again.

Option B: impaired digestion. As exercise lowers blood sugar, it's hard to digest food properly. So the effect is impaired digestion, which is not a positive one. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but another thought: Impaired digestion could mean that the body can't digest food properly, which would be a negative effect, not a positive one. So B is not a beneficial effect.

Option C: Worsening of vision. Definitely not helpful. So C is not a beneficial effect.

Option F: Increase in body fat. Not sure. Maybe exercise can cause body fat gain, but perhaps it's not a direct effect of managing diabetes. Alternatively, perhaps in the context of exercise and diabetes, it's not a benefit.

Option G: Hypoglycaemia. That's the opposite of exercise's effect. So it's not a beneficial effect.

So the options that are not beneficial are B, C, F, G.

But the question is which is not a beneficial effect, so the correct answer is the one that is not helpful.

Looking at the options, the question is looking for which is not a positive outcome. So the answer would be B, C, F, or G.

But the options are all single letters. So perhaps the question is looking for one of these.

Wait, the question asks which effect is not beneficial. So perhaps the answer is B, because it's impaired digestion, which is bad.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each effect in the context of diabetes.

Exercise helps lower blood sugar, which can help with managing diabetes. So D and E are positive effects.

For B, impaired digestion: exercise lowers blood sugar, which would make it harder to digest. So impaired digestion is a negative effect.

So B is the answer.

Wait, but I'm also considering F: increase in body fat. Maybe it's possible that some people with diabetes have a higher body fat, but I'm not sure if that's a positive or negative effect of exercise.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but the question is about the effects of exercise in people with diabetes. So the effects would be related to diabetes. So F is a non-diabetic effect, so perhaps it's not intended as an answer.

So the options that are not beneficial are B, C, F, G.

But the question is which is not a beneficial effect. So the answer would be B, because it's impaired digestion, which is bad.

Wait, but the options are A to G, and the question is which one is not. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

But wait, looking again, the options are:

A: Decreased muscle mass → Probably not a direct benefit.

B: Impaired digestion → Not helpful.

C: Worsening of vision → Not helpful.

D: Increase in blood sugar → Yes, beneficial.

E: Reduction in bone density → Yes.

F: Increase in body fat → Maybe not helpful.

G: Hypoglycaemia → No, it's bad.

So the question is which is not a beneficial effect. So the answer would be B, C, F, or G.

But since the options are single letters, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, but another thought: Some people with diabetes might have higher body fat due to other factors, but I don't think exercise would necessarily cause that. It's more about weight management. So F is not a beneficial effect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B, because exercise lowers blood sugar, making digestion worse.

So, the answer is B: Impaired digestion.
</think>

The question asks which of the following is not a beneficial effect of exercise in people with diabetes. To determine this, each option was analyzed in the context of diabetes-related health outcomes:

- **A: Decreased muscle mass**  
  While exercise can enhance strength and endurance, muscle mass is not a direct or primary benefit of exercise in people with diabetes. It may improve through other factors, but this is not a universally recognized positive effect.

- **B: Impaired digestion**  
  Exercise lowers blood sugar levels, which can make it harder to digest food properly. This is a negative effect, not a positive one associated with exercise in diabetes management.

- **C: Worsening of vision**  
  Exercise does not impair vision. This is unrelated to the benefits of exercise in diabetes and is not a helpful or harmful outcome.

- **D: Increase in blood sugar levels**  
  Exercise lowers blood sugar, which is a positive and beneficial effect in people with diabetes. This is a correct answer.

- **E: Reduction in bone density**  
  Exercise increases bone density by enhancing muscle mass, which is a positive benefit in people with diabetes. This is a correct answer.

- **F: Increase in body fat percentage**  
  While exercise can sometimes lead to weight gain, this is not a direct or beneficial effect of diabetes management. It may be influenced by other factors and is not a universally recognized positive outcome.

- **G: Hypoglycaemia**  
  Exercise lowers blood sugar, which can lead to hypoglycaemia. This is a harmful and negative effect, not a positive one.

Among the options, **B: Impaired digestion** is the only effect that is not a beneficial one associated with exercise in people with diabetes. It is the most direct and clear answer.

**ANSWER: B**
