Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about Edward's Electronics and their open-to-buy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to recall what the term "open-to-buy" means. From what I remember, it's the amount the company is willing to purchase for the upcoming month. So it's like their projected inventory needs before sales start the month.

The question gives me some data points. Let's see:

- March 1 inventory: $42,000
- March 31 planned inventory: $36,000
- Sales planned for the month: $22,000
- Markdowns planned: $2,000
- Commitment to purchase during the month: $6,000

Wait, I think the formula for open-to-buy (OTB) is:

OTB = Opening Inventory + Purchases - (Ending Inventory + Sales)

But wait, maybe I should think again. Another way to calculate it is:

OTB = (Next Month's Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening Inventory - Ending Inventory)

Let me confirm. The opening inventory is what they have at the start of the month. The closing inventory is what's left at the end. So the amount they need to purchase is the amount they'll buy to cover the sales and any markdowns minus the closing inventory.

Wait, let me make sure. Oh, another approach: The open-to-buy is the amount they need to purchase to cover their sales and planned markdowns but not to go below their committed purchase.

So, the formula is:

OTB = (Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening Inventory - Closing Inventory)

Because they have some inventory already, so they need to cover the sales and markdowns but not go below their committed purchase.

Wait, another thought: The store already has a committed purchase of $6,000 during the month. So they have to purchase at least that. But the sales and markdowns will affect how much they can buy.

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, the sales are $22k, and markdowns are $2k. So total sales and markdowns are $24k.

The opening inventory is $42k, and closing is $36k. So the change in inventory is $6k. Because 42k -36k =6k. So from opening to closing, they used $6k.

Wait, no. Actually, the opening inventory is what they have at the beginning. The ending is what's left. So the amount they can use is the opening minus the ending. So, 42k -36k=6k. That means they have $6k less at the end than the start.

So, the amount needed to cover sales and markdowns is:

(Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening - Ending) ?

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as the amount that needs to be purchased is equal to the total sales plus markdowns minus the closing inventory plus the committed purchase. Because they have committed to buy $6k during the month, that should be part of their inventory to keep.

Alternatively, maybe another approach is:

OTB = (Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening - Closing) 

Because the company's current inventory is opening, and they need to reach closing. So, the amount they can buy is Sales + Markdowns, minus the decrease in inventory.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, the store's planned inventory at the end of March is $36k. The opening was $42k, so the inventory decreased by $6k.

Now, the sales are $22k, and markdowns $2k, totaling $24k.

The required inventory at the end is $36k. So, they need to have $36k at the end, but the sales require that they have $24k remaining after sales.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model it as:

They have to ensure that their inventory at the end is $36k. So, the amount they need to have before sales is the closing plus the amount that can be sold.

Wait, perhaps another formula I've heard before is:

OTB = (Closing Inventory + Additional Sales) - (Opening - Closing)

No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

OTB = (Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening Inventory - Closing Inventory)

Let me plug in the numbers.

Sales + Markdowns = 22,000 + 2,000 = 24,000.

Opening - Closing = 42,000 - 36,000 = 6,000.

So OTB would be 24,000 - 6,000 = 18,000. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait another approach is: the company has committed to purchase $6,000 during the month. So, they can't go below that. So, the amount they need to purchase is:

(Sales + Markdowns) + Committed Purchase - Closing Inventory.

Wait, no. Let me think. The company starts with $42k, ends with $36k. So, they used up $6k (because 42-36=6). But they also need to have enough inventory to cover sales.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

OTB = (Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening - Closing) + Committed Purchase.

Wait, that can't be right because that would add the committed purchase which may not be correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try another approach.

The store needs to manage its inventory so that they can cover their sales and markdowns while having some inventory to purchase during the month.

They have a March 1 inventory of $42k, and they plan to have $36k by March 31.

So, the change in inventory is a decrease of $6k (from 42k to 36k).

Now, during the month, they plan to sell $22k, and have $2k markdowns, totaling $24k.

So, the amount they need to purchase is equal to the amount they can sell (24k) plus the amount they can keep in inventory, minus the decrease in inventory.

Wait, I'm getting tangled. Another way: The amount they need to purchase is the amount they can use for sales and any markdowns, but they have to make sure that their inventory doesn't drop below $36k.

So, the required purchasing is:

(Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening Inventory - Closing Inventory)

Because the opening is 42k, and the closing is 36k, so the needed amount is 24k -6k =18k.

Wait, but that would mean 18k. Let me see the options. Option C is $14,000, D is 48, etc.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

OTB = (Closing Inventory + Additional Sales) - (Opening Inventory - Additional Inventory)

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

OTB = (Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening - Closing) + Committed Purchase.

But what's the committed purchase? The store has already committed to purchase $6,000 during the month. So perhaps that's part of the OTB.

Wait, no. Let me think about it differently. The open-to-buy is the amount they need to buy in anticipation of sales and markdowns.

So, the company starts with $42k. They plan to have $36k by the end.

They need to make enough to cover sales and markdowns.

So, the total they need to cover is 24k (sales plus markdowns). But since they start with 42k, they can only use some of that. Wait, no, the issue is that they have to cover the sales, but they might have to have some inventory left. Or do they manage the inventory so that they can keep the opening inventory and have enough for the sales.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

OTB = (Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening Inventory - Closing Inventory)

Which would be 24,000 - 6,000 = 18,000.

Wait, but the options don't have 18k. Let me check the options:

Options are A:30, B:6, C:14, D:48, E:8, F:60, G:18, H:12, I:20, J:10.

So, 18k isn't an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the open-to-buy is the amount that needs to be purchased in anticipation of the month's sales and markdowns, minus the committed purchase.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

OTB = (Ending Inventory + Additional Sales) - (Opening Inventory - Additional Purchase)

Wait, that might not make sense. Let me try another approach.

The store starts March with $42k in inventory. They have a committed purchase of $6k during the month. So, they need to have at least $6k in inventory at the end of March.

They plan to sell $22k and have $2k markdowns, so they need to have $24k available for sales and any markdowns. But they can only keep $36k by the end of the month.

So, the amount they can use is 36k. But they need to cover the $24k, so the OTB would be 24k - (42k -36k) = 24k -6k = 18k.

But again, 18k isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the committed purchase is part of the OTB. So, the OTB would be the required purchases for sales plus markdowns, minus the committed purchase.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the open-to-buy is the amount the company needs to purchase during the month to meet their sales and planned markdowns, but not to go below their committed purchase.

So, the required purchase would be:

(Sales + Markdowns) - (Opening Inventory - Closing Inventory) = 24k -6k=18k. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 14k, D is 48k, G is 18k. So if my calculation gives 18k, which isn't present, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think about the correct formula again. I think the correct formula for open-to-buy is:

OTB = (Ending Inventory + Additional Sales) - (Opening Inventory - Additional Purchase)

But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try another approach. The formula I recall is:

OTB = (Closing Inventory + Additional Sales) - (Opening Inventory - Additional Purchase)

Wait, but that can't be right. Alternatively, the open-to-buy is the amount needed to cover the planned sales and any markdowns, minus the decrease in inventory.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

OTB = (S + M) - (C - E).

Where S is sales, M markdowns, C is opening inventory, E closing inventory.

So, S + M =22k+2k=24k.

C -E =42k-36k=6k.

So, OTB=24k-6k=18k.

But the options don't have 18k. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

OTB = (S + M) - (C - (E + Additional Purchase)).

Wait, no, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the committed purchase is separate from the open-to-buy. The open-to-buy is the amount they need to purchase to cover the planned sales and markdowns, but not go below their committed purchase.

So, the amount they need to purchase is equal to the planned sales and markdowns minus the decrease in inventory, but they have committed to purchase a certain amount during the month.

So, the open-to-buy would be:

OTB = (S + M) - (C - E) + Committed Purchase.

Wait, that would be 24k -6k +6k =24k.

But 24k isn't an option either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the open-to-buy is the amount they need to buy to cover the planned sales and markdowns, but not to dip below their committed purchase. So:

They have a committed purchase of $6k, so they must purchase at least $6k during the month.

The amount they need to buy is the amount needed to cover the sales and markdowns, minus the decrease in inventory.

So, 24k (S+M) -6k (C-E) =18k. But this is what I had before.

But since 18k isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

OTB = (S + M) - (C - E)

Which is 24k -6k=18k. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A:30, B:6, C:14, D:48, E:8, F:60, G:18, H:12, I:20, J:10.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the store's March 1 inventory is $42k. March 31 is $36k. So, the change is 42k -36k=6k.

So, from 42k to 36k, the company used up 6k.

Now, the sales are $22k, and markdowns $2k, totaling 24k.

To cover the sales and markdowns, the company needs to have 24k. But they only have 36k left by the end, so they don't need to purchase any more. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct way to calculate it is:

They need to purchase enough to cover their planned sales and markdowns, but not to go below their committed purchase.

So, the amount to purchase is:

(S + M) - (Opening - Closing) + Committed Purchase.

Wait, that would be 24k -6k +6k=24k.

But 24k is not an option. So perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is:

OTB = (S + M) - (Opening - Closing) + Committed Purchase.

But that would give 24-6+6=24, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

OTB = (S + M) - (Opening - Closing) - (Committed Purchase).

So 24 -6 -6=12, which is option H.

Wait, 12 is option H.

Wait, if I consider that the open-to-buy is (S + M) - (Opening - Closing) - Committed Purchase, then 24-6-6=12.

So that would be 12k, which is option H.

But I'm a bit uncertain about this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

The open-to-buy is the amount needed to cover planned sales and markdowns, minus the decrease in inventory. But since they have committed to purchase, they must have that amount.

So, if planned sales and markdowns minus decrease in inventory is 18k, but they have to purchase 6k, then the open-to-buy would be 18k-6k=12k.

Wait, that makes sense because the open-to-buy is the amount they need to purchase to cover their sales and markdowns, but since they have committed to purchase, they can't go below that.

So, 18k is the amount required to cover sales and markdowns, but since they have a committed purchase of 6k, they can't purchase less than that. So, the open-to-buy is 12k.

So, 12k is option H.

But wait, let me think again. The open-to-buy is the amount of inventory the company needs to purchase during the month to cover their planned sales and markdowns but not to go below their committed purchase.

So, the required purchase is 18k (as per 24k -6k=18k). But since they have committed to purchase 6k, they need to purchase 18k-6k=12k.

So, the open-to-buy is 12k, which is option H.

Wait, but option C is 14k, which is nearby. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps another approach. The open-to-buy is the amount needed to meet planned sales and markdowns, minus the decrease in inventory. But since they have committed to purchase during the month, that amount must be covered.

So, (S + M) - (Opening - Closing) =24k -6k=18k. But they have to purchase 6k, so the open-to-buy is 18k -6k=12k.

So, the correct answer is 12k, which is option H.

Wait, but looking back at the options, H is 12k. So, I think that's the correct answer.
</think>

The question asks for the store's open-to-buy (OTB), which represents the amount the company needs to purchase during the month to cover planned sales and markdowns, minus the decrease in inventory. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Identify the relevant data points:**
   - March 1 inventory: \$42,000
   - March 31 inventory: \$36,000
   - Sales planned: \$22,000
   - Markdowns planned: \$2,000
   - Committed purchase during the month: \$6,000

2. **Calculate the change in inventory:**
   - The inventory decreased by \$6,000 (42,000 - 36,000).

3. **Determine the total planned sales and markdowns:**
   - Total planned sales and markdowns = \$22,000 + \$2,000 = \$24,000.

4. **Calculate the required purchase to meet sales and markdowns:**
   - Required purchase = Total planned sales and markdowns - Change in inventory = \$24,000 - \$6,000 = \$18,000.

5. **Account for the committed purchase:**
   - The store has already committed to purchasing \$6,000 during the month.
   - Therefore, the open-to-buy is the amount needed to cover sales and markdowns minus the committed purchase: \$18,000 - \$6,000 = \$12,000.

6. **Match the result to the options:**
   - The correct answer is \$12,000, which corresponds to option H.
