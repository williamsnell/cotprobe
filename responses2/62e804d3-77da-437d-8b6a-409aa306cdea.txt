Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about financial statements and accounting policies. I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that an entity prepares its financial statements on its income tax basis. The accompanying notes include a summary of significant accounting policies. These policies discuss the basis of presentation, which is different from GAAP. The question is about the dollar amount of the effects of the difference between income tax basis and GAAP.

The options are A through J, each describing where this difference is included in the financial statements. I need to determine which option is correct.

First, I'll recall what I know about financial statements and tax policies. Financial statements are reports that show a company's financial position, performance, and cash flows. The basis of presentation refers to how assets and liabilities are recorded and measured. GAAP, on the other hand, is the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles set by the U.S. GAAP.

The question is about the difference in the basis of presentation between the company's income tax method and GAAP. So, the company is using a different basis for accounting (maybe tax basis, which is different from GAAP's accounting rules) and this affects how they report their financial statements for tax purposes.

The dollar amount of the effects would depend on the specific basis. For example, if the company is using a tax basis higher than GAAP, then the income would be higher on the tax return, but under GAAP it might be lower. The difference would be the difference between the two amounts, which is a monetary value.

Now, regarding where this difference is included:

- The balance sheet: Typically, the basis of accounting affects how assets and liabilities are recorded. So if the basis changes, the balance sheet would reflect that. But the question is about the difference in the basis affecting the financial statements, not just the balance sheet.

Wait, no. The question is about the effect on the financial statements. The basis of presentation is how assets and liabilities are recorded, but the income statement's income is based on tax basis. So the difference in basis affects the basis accounting, which is part of the financial statements as presented.

Wait, but the question is about the dollar amount of the effect. So the effect is a difference in the amount, which is a certain dollar amount. For example, if the company's tax basis is $100 higher than GAAP, then the income statement would report higher income under tax than GAAP. But when it comes to the financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, etc.), the basis is reflected in the accounting for assets and liabilities.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things. The basis is how assets and liabilities are recorded. So the basis affects the balance sheet because assets and liabilities are reflected in the same financial statements. However, the income statement reflects the income based on the tax basis.

So the difference in basis between the income tax basis and GAAP's accounting would affect the balance sheet and the income statement, I think.

Wait, but the question is about the dollar amount's effect. So the company's basis (income tax basis) vs GAAP's basis would cause a difference in their reported income. The difference would be the amount of the tax benefit versus GAAP. For example, if under the company's tax basis, they have higher expenses or lower revenues, leading to higher income tax expense. But under GAAP, they have different expenses or revenues. The difference in the basis would result in a difference in the reported income.

But the question is about the dollar amount of the effect, which is the actual amount. So the difference between what the company reports under their basis and what GAAP reports would be a specific amount. The question is asking whether this difference is included in the notes or something else.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP. So the basis is different. The amount difference (like $100, $200) is the dollar amount.

So what is this difference included in? It's a difference in the basis of accounting. The basis is how assets and liabilities are recorded. So the basis affects the balance sheet because the assets and liabilities are shown. But the income statement reflects the income based on the basis.

So the difference in basis would be included in the balance sheet (since it's part of the financial statements) as it's part of how assets and liabilities are recorded. But the income statement would also show a difference because the basis is used to calculate the income.

Wait, but the options are about where the dollar amount is included. The options are about whether the difference is included in the balance sheet, income statement, or auditor's report.

Wait, the question is about the effect of the difference between these two methods on the financial statements. The basis difference affects both the income statement (how income is calculated) and the balance sheet (how assets and liabilities are recorded).

So the effect is a difference in both income statement and balance sheet. But the options don't directly state this. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: Balance sheet only.

B: Income statement only.

C: Not quantified and included elsewhere.

D: Balance sheet and auditor report.

E: Included only in notes and auditor report.

F: All three?

G: Balance sheet and auditor report.

H: Only in auditor's report.

I: Income statement and notes.

J: Both in notes and auditor.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, the basis of presentation is the method used to record assets and liabilities. The basis also affects the income statement, as the income is based on that basis. So the basis is part of the financial statements. So the difference in basis would be reflected in the balance sheet, income statement, and the notes. However, the question is about the dollar amount of the difference between the two methods.

Wait, but the question is about the effect on the financial statements. The difference in the basis (GAAP vs tax basis) would affect the income statement (because it's how income is calculated) and the balance sheet (because it's how assets and liabilities are recorded). So the effect is a difference that would be included in both the income statement and the balance sheet.

But I thought each of these is a different part. So if the question is about where the dollar amount is included, it would be in the notes because the basis is part of the accounting policies. Alternatively, the difference in the basis is a part of the basis of accounting, which is part of the financial statements.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the difference is included in the notes or in the income statement or balance sheet. The options are about where the difference is included.

The question says, "the dollar amount of the effects of the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP." So the difference is between the two methods, which affects the basis of accounting. The basis of accounting is part of the financial statements as presented. So the basis is included in the balance sheet and the income statement.

Wait, but the basis is part of the accounting policies, which are in the notes. So the dollar amount would be reflected in the notes because it's about the basis of presentation.

Wait, but the options are about where the difference is included. Let me read the options again.

Option J says is required to be included in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report.

So the options are considering where the dollar effect is reported. If the difference is in the basis, which is part of the accounting policies and thus in the notes, and also affects the balance sheet and income statement. But the question is about the dollar amount's effect on financial statements.

Wait, no. The question is about the dollar amount being included in the financial statements. So, if the entity is using a different basis, the difference would be in the notes because the basis is part of the policies.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of an example. Suppose a company uses the tax basis for assets, while GAAP uses the fair value basis. The difference in the basis (e.g., $100 difference) would be in the notes because it's part of the accounting policies. But the dollar amount is $100, so it's required to be included in the notes. But the question is whether this difference is included in the balance sheet, income statement, or notes.

Wait, perhaps the basis is included in the balance sheet and the income statement. Because the basis affects how assets and liabilities are reported, so the balance sheet. And the basis affects the income statement, as it's how income is calculated.

But the options are not about that. Let's see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J: Included in the notes and the auditor's report.

Option G: Included in the auditor's report and the balance sheet.

Wait, the question is about the effect on the financial statements. The basis is part of the financial statements, so the difference is included in the notes and the balance sheet. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the difference in basis is reflected in the balance sheet because it's about how assets and liabilities are recorded, and in the income statement because it's about how income is calculated. But the question is about what part of the financial statements the dollar amount is included in.

Wait, the options are:

A: Balance sheet only.

Wait, but that can't be right because the basis is also part of the balance sheet.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about where the difference is presented in the financial statements. The basis is part of the financial statements. So, the difference would be in the balance sheet (as it affects the assets and liabilities) and the income statement (as it affects the income). But the question is about the effect on the financial statements.

Wait, but the options are about where the dollar amount is included. So, the difference is part of the basis of the financial statements, so it's in the notes. Alternatively, the difference is part of the balance sheet because it affects the presentation of assets and liabilities, and it's also part of the income statement because it affects how income is reported.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the dollar amount is required to be included in the balance sheet and the notes. Because the basis of presentation affects the balance sheet (how assets and liabilities are recorded), and the basis is part of the notes (accounting policies).

Wait, but the options are about where the dollar amount is included in the financial statements. So, perhaps the options are about whether it's in the balance sheet, income statement, notes, or auditor's report.

Wait, perhaps the difference is considered part of the notes and the balance sheet. But looking at the options again:

Option J: Included in notes and auditor report.

Option G: Included in auditor report and balance sheet.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the basis. The basis is part of the financial statements, so the difference is in the notes because it's about the basis. But when reporting the difference, is it included in the balance sheet, the income statement, or the notes.

Wait, I think the difference in the basis is part of the basis of presentation. So, the basis is part of the accounting policies, which is in the notes. Also, the basis affects the balance sheet and the income statement. But the question is about the dollar amount's effect on financial statements.

Wait, no, the question is about the effect on the financial statements. So, the difference is part of the basis, which is included in the notes, but is it reflected in the balance sheet and income statement? So, perhaps the answer is J: notes and auditor's report.

Wait, but that's not making sense. Because the basis is in the notes, and the effect of the basis change is part of the balance sheet and income statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the difference again. The difference is in the basis, which affects the balance sheet (through assets and liabilities) and the income statement (through income). So, the dollar amount is part of the basis that's included in the notes. But the effect of this basis on the financial statements is part of the balance sheet and income statement. So, the difference is in the notes, but the impact on the financial statements is in the balance sheet and income statement.

But looking at the options, none of them say that. Hmm.

Wait, the options are about where the difference is included. So, the difference in the basis is part of the basis of presentation, which is in the notes. But the actual effect on the financial statements would be in the balance sheet and the income statement.

So, the correct answer would be that the dollar amount is included in the balance sheet and the income statement. But looking at the options, none have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the auditor's report. The notes to the financial statements would include the basis, and the auditor's report would include it as well. So, the difference is in the notes to the financial statements, and the difference is also part of the audit report. So, the dollar amount is included in the notes and the auditor's report.

Alternatively, the question is about whether the basis is part of the financial statements. The basis affects the balance sheet and the income statement, so the difference is presented in both. But the options are about where the dollar amount is included, not about the effect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the question is asking. The question is about the dollar amount of the effect of the difference between the two methods. The effect is a difference in the basis, which is part of the notes to the financial statements. But the actual effect is reflected in the balance sheet and the income statement.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that the difference is included in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report.

Looking at the options, option J says it's required in the notes and the auditor's report.

Alternatively, perhaps the difference is in the notes because it's part of the basis of presentation, but the actual effect is in the balance sheet and income statement.

Wait, the question is about the effect on the financial statements. So, perhaps the effect is part of the balance sheet and income statement, but the basis is in the notes.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that says the effect is in the balance sheet and income. So perhaps the answer is that the difference is included in the notes and the balance sheet and the income statement.

Wait, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J: included in notes and auditor's report.

Because the basis is part of the notes, and the dollar amount's effect is also part of the notes. Alternatively, the basis is part of the notes, but the actual effect is in the balance sheet and income statement.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the difference being part of the notes because it's about the basis. So, the correct answer is J: included in notes to financial statements and the auditor's report.

Wait, but the options are about where the difference is included. So, if the difference is part of the notes, but the effect on the financial statements is in the balance sheet and income, then J would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J: included in the notes and auditor's report. Because the basis is included in the notes, and the effect is in the balance sheet and income statement, but the question is about where the dollar amount is included. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about where the effect is, but where the basis is presented. The basis is part of the notes, and the effect of the basis change is part of the balance sheet and income statement.

So, the dollar amount of the effect is part of the balance sheet and income statement. But the question is about the inclusion of the dollar amount in the financial statements. So, the option that says the dollar amount is included in the balance sheet and the income statement would be correct. But looking at the options, none have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J. Because the basis is included in the notes to the financial statements, and the difference is also reflected in the auditor's report. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the basis is part of the notes, and the effect is part of the balance sheet and income statements. So the correct answer would be that the difference is in the notes and the balance sheet and income statement. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the question is asking. The question is about the dollar amount of the effect. So the difference in the basis between the two methods is a specific amount. The difference is part of the basis of presentation, and the basis is part of the notes. So the dollar amount is required in the notes.

But the options don't mention just the notes. Wait, looking at the options again:

A: Balance sheet only.

B: Income statement only.

C: Not quantified and included in either the notes or the auditor's report.

D: Balance sheet and auditor's report.

E: Included in notes and auditor's report.

F: All three.

G: Balance sheet and auditor's report.

H: Only in auditor's report.

I: Included in income statement and notes.

J: Included in notes and auditor's report.

So, if the difference is part of the basis, which is in the notes, and the effect is in the balance sheet and income statement, but the question is about where the dollar amount is included. So perhaps the correct answer is J: the dollar amount is required to be included in the notes and the auditor's report.

Wait, but the dollar amount is part of the basis, which is in the notes. The effect is in the balance sheet and income statement. So, the correct answer would be that the difference is included in the notes, and the effect is in the balance sheet and income. But the question is about where the dollar amount is included, so perhaps the answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the basis is part of the notes and the effect is in the balance sheet and the income statement. So the question is about where the dollar amount is included in the financial statements. So, the basis is in the notes, but the effect is in the balance sheet and income.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the difference is included in the notes to the financial statements and is also included in the auditor's report. So, option J.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about what the options are saying. The question is about whether the difference is included in certain sections.

The options are about where the dollar amount is.

So, if the difference is part of the notes, then the answer would be J: notes and auditor's report.

Alternatively, perhaps the basis is included in the notes, and the effect is in the balance sheet and income. So the correct answer is that the effect is in the balance sheet and income, but the question is about where the dollar amount is.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the difference is included in the notes, and the effect is in the balance sheet and income. So, the question is about where the difference is presented, which is in the notes, but the effect is elsewhere.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think of it another way. The difference is in the basis of accounting. The basis is part of the notes to the financial statements. The effect of the basis change is in the balance sheet and the income statement.

So the dollar amount is part of the basis, which is in the notes. The effect is part of the balance sheet and income. So, the correct answer is that the dollar amount is included in the notes and the balance sheet. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the effect. The effect is a specific amount, so it's part of the notes. But I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I should think about what the options are saying. The question is about where the dollar amount is included.

So, the options are about where the difference in the basis is included. The basis is part of the notes, so the difference is in the notes. But the effect of the basis change is in the balance sheet and income statement.

So, the correct answer is that the dollar amount is required to be included in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report.

Wait, I think that's option J. So, the answer is option J.
</think>

The correct answer is **Option J: Included in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report.**

### Explanation:
The entity prepares its financial statements using the fair value method, which affects the basis of the financial statements. The basis of accounting is part of the notes to the financial statements, reflecting the differences in basis calculations. The dollar amount of the effect is included in the balance sheet and the income statement. However, the question specifically asks where the dollar amount is included. Since the basis of presentation is part of the notes and the effect of the basis change is included in the auditor's report, the correct answer is **Option J**.
