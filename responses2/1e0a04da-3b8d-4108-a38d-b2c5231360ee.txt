Okay, so I've got this problem here about partners investing in a fast-food store and sharing profits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So, the question says that Ike Waterman and Sean Cole invested $20,000 and $10,000 respectively. Each partner gets 6% of their investment as their share. The rest of the profit is split equally. The total profit last year was $10,400. We need to find out each partner's share.

First, I should calculate each partner's share from their initial investments. Ike's share is 6% of $20,000. Let me do 6% of 20,000. 6% is 0.06, so 20,000 * 0.06 = $1,200. So, Ike gets $1,200 from his investment.

Similarly, Sean's share is 6% of $10,000. That's 0.06 * 10,000 = $600. So, Sean gets $600 from his investment.

Adding those together: $1,200 + $600 = $1,800. So together, they get $1,800 from their initial investments. Now, the total profit is $10,400. So, the remaining profit after their share is 10,400 - 1,800 = $8,600.

But wait, the remaining profit is to be split equally. So, each partner gets half of $8,600. Half of 8,600 is 4,300. So, each gets $4,300 from the remaining profit.

Now, adding this to their initial shares:

Ike: $1,200 (initial) + $4,300 (remaining) = $5,500.

Sean: $600 (initial) + $4,300 (remaining) = $4,900.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options, and I'm trying to see which one matches. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E says Waterman's share was $5,500 and Cole's was $4,900. That matches what I just calculated. So, that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the math because sometimes I might make a mistake. 

Total investment: 20k + 10k = 30k. Each gets 6%: 20k * 0.06 is 1.2k, 10k *0.06 is 0.6k. Total 1.8k. Profit is 10,400, so 10,400 - 1,800 = 8,600. 8,600 / 2 = 4,300 each. So, totals are 1,200 +4,300=5500 and 600+4300=4900. So option E is correct. So the answer should be option E.

The correct answer is E, where Waterman's share is $5,500 and Cole's share is $4,900.
