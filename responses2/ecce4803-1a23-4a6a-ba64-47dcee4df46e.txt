Question:

A teacher believes that giving her students a practice quiz every week will motivate them to study harder, leading to a greater overall understanding of the course material. She tries this technique for a year, and everyone in the class achieves a grade of at least C. Is this an experiment or an observational study?

Options:

A: An observational study, because the teacher merely observed the students' progress
B: An observational study, because there was no use of a control group
C: An observational study, but a poorly designed one because randomization was not used
D: An experiment, thus making cause and effect a reasonable conclusion
E: An observational study, but the results cannot be generalized to other classes
F: An observational study, but a well-designed one because all students were observed
G: An experiment, but the outcome cannot definitively be attributed to the quizzes
H: An experiment, but a poorly designed one because there was no control group
I: An experiment, but with no reasonable conclusion possible about cause and effect
J: An experiment, because the teacher was actively manipulating the environment

Okay, so I've got this question about whether a teacher's method is an experiment or an observational study. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the teacher tried giving her students a practice quiz every week for a year and noticed everyone got at least a C. The question is whether this is an experiment or an observational study.

Hmm, I remember that an experiment involves actively manipulating variables to observe the effects. In this case, the teacher is actively changing somethingâ€”introducing the practice quizzes. She's trying a new technique. So she's actively changing the condition for the students, which is a key element of an experiment.

On the other hand, observational studies are when the researcher just observes and measures variables without actively changing them. They look for associations, not causation. So if the teacher didn't actively change the quizzes but just let the students study, it's an observational study. But here she's actively changing them.

Wait, but wait. The question is whether it's an experiment or not. So the fact that the teacher was actively manipulating the environment makes it an experiment. So options that say it's an experiment would be D, H, I.

Looking at the options:

Option D: An experiment, making cause-effect conclusion. That makes sense because the teacher is actively changing the variable (the quizzes) and seeing the effect.

Option H: experiment but no reasonable conclusion. But that's about the study's design. If she designed it well, maybe the conclusion is plausible. But the question is about whether it's an experiment.

So the main point is whether the teacher was actively changing variables. Since she was actively changing, it's an experiment. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that it's an observational study? If she just observed the students' grades without changing the quizzes, but here she actively changed them, so it's more of an experiment.

So the answer should be option D.

The teacher's approach involves actively changing the practice quizzes to observe their effect on student grades, which is a key feature of an experiment. Therefore, the study is an experiment.

ANSWER: D
