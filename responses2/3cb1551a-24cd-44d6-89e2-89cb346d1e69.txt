Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about circular motion, I think. It's about a plane turning around a pylon, and we're dealing with centripetal acceleration. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the maximum centripetal acceleration a pilot can withstand is about 6g. For a plane traveling at 150 m/s, what's the turning radius when the acceleration is 6g? The options are from A to J, all different values in meters.

Hmm. I remember that centripetal acceleration is given by the formula a = v² / r, where a is acceleration, v is velocity, and r is the radius. So I need to rearrange this formula to solve for r.

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure. The formula for centripetal acceleration is a = (v²) / r. So if I need to find r, I should rearrange it to solve for r, which would be r = v² / a. Right.

But wait, what is 'a' in this context? Oh wait, the question says the maximum centripetal acceleration is 6g. So I need to calculate 6 times Earth's gravity. G is approximately 9.8 m/s². So 6g would be 6 * 9.8, which is 58.8 m/s².

So now, plugging into the formula: r = (150)^2 / 58.8. Let me compute that.

150 squared is 22,500. Dividing that by 58.8. Hmm, let me do this division.

I can break it down: 22,500 divided by 58.8. Let's see, 58.8 is approximately 58.8, so 22,500 / 58.8.

Let me compute 22,500 ÷ 58.8. Let me see, perhaps it's easier to multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal. So that's 225000 ÷ 588.

Now, let's approximate. 588 * 383 = Let's see, 588 * 383. Let me compute 588 * 300 = 176400, 588 * 80 = 47040, 588 * 3 = 1764. So 176400 + 47040 = 223440; plus 1764 is 225,204. But wait, 383 * 588 is 225,204. Our numerator is 225,000. So 383 * 588 is 225,204, which is a bit more than 225,000.

So 225,000 would be about 383 minus a little bit. Let's say approximately 383 minus (204/588). 204 ÷ 588 is about 0.347. So 383 - 0.347 is approximately 382.653 meters. Wait, but wait, I think I made a miscalculation here. Let me think.

Wait, no: 225,000 divided by 588. Since 588 * 383 is 225,204, which is 204 more than 225,000. So 588 * 383 = 225,204. Let me see, 225,204 is 204 more than 225,000. So 225,000 = 588 * (383 - (204/588)).

So 204/588 is approximately 0.347. So 383 - 0.347 is approximately 382.653. So r is approximately 382.653 meters. But wait, wait, that doesn't match any of the options given.

Wait, looking at the options: Let me see. The options are in hundreds of meters. Option F is 4.5e2, G is 5e2, etc. So I'm getting around 383 meters. That would be option I (2e2) or maybe none. Wait, no, the options are A: 1.5e2 (150 m), B:420 m, C:680, D:383, E:250, F:450, G:500, H:750, I:200, J:300.

Wait, wait, I thought my calculation was about 383 meters. So in the options, D is 383 × 100 m? No, wait, the options are all in meters, just written as 1.5e2 m is 150 meters, etc.

Wait, no, the options are written as:

A: 1.5 × 10^2 m → 150 m

B: 4.2 × 10^2 m → 420 m

C: 6.8 × 10^2 →680 m

D: 3.83 × 10^2 → 383 m

E: 2.5 ×10^2 →250 m

Wait, but in my calculation, I got approximately 383 meters. So D would be the correct answer. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute r. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check the steps.

The formula is a = v²/r. So solving for r:

r = v² / a.

v is 150 m/s, a is 6g, which is 6 * 9.8 = 58.8 m/s².

So v squared is 150^2 = 22,500.

So r = 22,500 / 58.8.

Let me compute that using a calculator. 22,500 ÷ 58.8 is equal to:

Compute 58.8 × 383 = ?

58.8 × 300 = 17,640.

58.8 × 80 = 4,704.

58.8 × 3 = 176.4.

Adding them together: 17,640 + 4,704 = 22,344; plus 176.4 is 22,520.4.

So 58.8 × 383 = 22,520.4.

But our numerator is 22,500, which is 20.4 less than 22,520.4.

So each 1 in 383 gives about 58.8. 20.4 / 58.8 is approximately 0.347.

So 383 - 0.347 ≈ 382.653.

So approximately 382.65 meters. Rounding to two significant figures, it's 3.8e2 meters, which is 380. So 4.2e2 is 420, which is higher. So the correct option would be D (3.83e2 m), but wait, my calculation gives approximately 382.65 m, which is about 3.83e2. So option D.

Wait, but looking back, the options are given as:

A:150, B:420, C:680, D:383, E:250, F:450, G:500, H:750, I:200, J:300.

So D is 383 m, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but I think another way to approach the problem is to calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 22,500 divided by 58.8.

58.8 × 383 = 58.8 × 380 + 58.8 ×3.

58.8 ×380: Let me compute 58.8 × 300 = 17640, 58.8 ×80=4704 → 17640 +4704=22344.

58.8 ×3=176.4.

So 22344 + 176.4 =22520.4.

Now, 22500 is 20.4 less than 22520.4.

Each additional 1 in 383 adds 58.8 meters.

So 58.8 × 0.347 ≈ 20.4.

So 383 - 0.347 = 382.653.

So 382.653 meters is approximately 3.83e2 meters, which is option D.
</think>

To determine the turning radius for a plane traveling at 150 m/s with a centripetal acceleration of 6g, we use the formula for centripetal acceleration:

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
\]

Rearranging for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{v^2}{a}
\]

Here, \( v = 150 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( a = 6g \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Thus:

\[
a = 6 \times 9.8 = 58.8 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
r = \frac{150^2}{58.8} = \frac{22500}{58.8} \approx 382.653 \, \text{m}
\]

This value is approximately \( 3.83 \times 10^2 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **D**.
