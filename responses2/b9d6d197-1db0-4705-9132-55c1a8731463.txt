Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract assignment question. Let me read it again.

So, the scenario is a homeowner and a painter enter into a contract. The painter is to paint the homeowner's home for $10,000. The contract says payment is due within one week after the painting is completed. Also, the rights are not assignable, meaning the painter can't assign the rights to the painter's nephew. 

The painter started painting on June 1, and on June 10, he assigned his rights to his nephew. Now, the question is about what validates this assignment.

The options are A to H, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm. So, what's the law here? I remember that contracts have certain terms about assignability. I think that certain types of contracts, like personal service contracts, are typically nonassignable. So, if this is a personal service contract, the painter can't assign his rights.

Wait, the contract here says the rights are not assignable. So, the painter can't assign them. That means the assignment is invalid. So, if the painter assigns to his nephew, that's not allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The assignment would be a novation, which would relieve the homeowner of liability. But since it's nonassignable, that's invalid. So A is incorrect.

Option B: The assignment is valid only if the homeowner consents. I don't think that's correct. Assignability is usually a general rule, regardless of the parties' consent. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The assignment would be effective only after completion. No, because the contract states the rights are not assignable. Assignability usually happens before the contract is completed. So C is wrong.

Option D: The assignment would be revocable even if reduced to writing and signed. I don't think so. Revocability is about whether the contract can be canceled. Assignability is about whether the parties can transfer rights. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The assignment is irrevocable if reduced. Again, no. Assignability doesn't affect revocability. So E is wrong.

Option F: The assignment wouldn't relieve the homeowner of liability. Wait, no. Since the contract states the rights are not assignable, the painter can't assign them. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Since the contract is personal service, the homeowner isn't liable. Wait, I thought nonassignable contracts are for personal services. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The homeowner is obligated because the contract is assignable. But the contract says the rights are not assignable, so H is wrong.

Option I: The homeowner is obligated because the contract is assignable. Wait, the contract explicitly says the rights are not assignable. So I is wrong.

Wait, but let me think again. The contract said the rights are not assignable. So the painter can't assign the rights. So assigning it to his nephew is invalid. So the assignment doesn't do anything. So the homeowner would still have to pay. So the options A-F are all incorrect. Then, the correct answer must be I or D.

Wait, looking at the options again, option I says the homeowner would be obligated to pay. Since the contract states the rights are not assignable, the painter can't assign. So the assignment is invalid, so the painter can't take the payment. Thus, the homeowner would have to pay the painter. So, the option I is correct. Let me check the options.

Wait, option H says the assignment would be irrevocable even if written and signed. I thought that the irrevocability depends on whether the contract can be canceled. Assignability is about transferring rights, not revocability. So H is incorrect.

So the correct answer is I. So the options are I: The homeowner would be obligated to pay the nephew, because the contract was assignable. But wait, the contract says the rights are not assignable. So I think that's incorrect.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The contract says the rights are not assignable. So the painter cannot assign them. So the assignment is invalid. Thus, the painter can't take the payment. Therefore, the painter's assignment to his nephew is invalid, so the homeowner must pay the painter. So, what's the correct statement? The options.

Looking back, the options are:

A: assignment is a novation, which means the painter takes the payment. But the contract says it's not assignable, so no valid novation. So A is incorrect.

B: assignment valid only if the homeowner consents. No, it's always invalid. So B is incorrect.

C: effective only after completion. No, earlier, so C is wrong.

D: assignment is revocable even if reduced to writing and signed. No, assignment is not about revocability. So D is wrong.

E: assignment is irrevocable if reduced. No, it's not about revocability. So E is wrong.

F: assignment doesn't relieve liability. Correct, since the contract says so.

G: personal service contract, so no liability. Correct.

H: irrevocable if reduced. Wrong.

So the correct statements must be F and G. But the question is about what's correct regarding the assignment.

The question is which statement is most accurate regarding the painter's assignment.

The options are A-I.

So, the correct option is I: the assignment would be obligated to pay. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the painter cannot assign the rights. So the assignment would be invalid. So the painter can't get the payment. So the painter's nephew (the other party) would be the one to pay. Therefore, the painter's assignment is invalid, so the painter must pay the homeowner. So the correct statement would be that the painter is obligated to pay.

Looking at the options, which of the statements is correct.

Looking again, option I says the assignment would be obligated to pay, implying the painter must pay the homeowner. Which is correct.

Alternatively, option H says the assignment would be irrevocable, but wait, the contract says the rights are not assignable, so the painter cannot assign. So the assignment is invalid. So the painter can't take payment, so the painter must pay. So the correct statement is that the painter is obligated to pay, which is option I.

Wait, but let me check the options:

Option I: The homeowner would be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was assignable.

But if the contract says the rights are not assignable, the contract is invalid, so the painter can't assign. So the option I is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again.

The contract says the rights are not assignable. So the painter cannot assign the rights to his nephew. So the assignment is invalid. Therefore, the painter's nephew cannot take payment. So the painter must pay. So the correct statement is that the painter is obligated to pay. Looking at the options, which are:

Looking for statements that reflect this.

Option G says "Since personal service contracts of this nature are nonassignable, the homeowner would be under no duty to pay the nephew." Wait, the painter is the one who started the contract, and the painter assigned to his nephew. So the painter's contract is to the painter's nephew. So if the contract is nonassignable, the painter can't assign, so the painter's nephew can't take the payment. Therefore, the painter must pay. So the correct statement would be that the painter is obligated to pay.

Looking at the options, I think option H is incorrect because the contract says the rights are not assignable, so the painter can't assign. So the painter's assignment is invalid, so the painter must pay.

Wait, but the options are:

I: The homeowner would be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was assignable.

But the contract states the rights are not assignable, so the painter cannot assign. So I is incorrect.

So, which option is correct? Let's go through the options again.

Option A: The assignment would constitute a novation, relieving the homeowner. But since the contract says the rights are not assignable, the painter can't assign. So A is wrong.

Option B: Valid only if the homeowner consents. No, it's not conditional.

Option C: Only effective after completion. No, because the contract says it's not assignable, so the assignment is invalid before completion.

Option D: Assignment is revocable even if written. No, revocability is about cancellation, not transfer. So D is wrong.

Option E: Assignment irrevocable. No, irrevocable is about the contract's ability to be canceled. So E is wrong.

Option F: Assignment doesn't relieve liability. Correct. So F is correct.

Option G: Homeowner is under no duty. Incorrect. Because the contract says the rights are not assignable, so the painter can't assign. So G is wrong.

Option H: Assignment irrevocable. Incorrect. It's not about revocability.

So the correct answer is F: The assignment would not relieve the homeowner of liability, so the painter assignment is invalid, and the painter must pay. But looking back, the options say:

Which statements are correct?

Wait, the question is: "Which of the following statements is most accurate with regard to the painter's assignment?"

Wait, wait, the options are A to H, and the question is about which option is correct regarding the assignment.

So, the correct statement is F: The assignment would not relieve the homeowner of liability, since the contract says the rights are not assignable. So F is correct.

Wait, but the options are:

F: The assignment would not relieve the homeowner of liability, since the contract was nonassignable.

So F is correct. So the correct answer is F.

But let me make sure. The contract says the rights are not assignable, meaning the painter can't assign them. So the painter's nephew can't get payment. So the painter is obligated to pay the homeowner. So F is correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as statements. So the correct answer is F, which says the assignment doesn't relieve the homeowner's liability. So the correct statement is F.

But earlier, I thought that the painter's assignment is invalid, so the painter is obligated to pay. So the correct statement is F, which is correct.

The question revolves around a contract where the painter is to paint the homeowner's home for $10,000, with payment due within one week after completion. The contract states that the painter's rights are nonassignable, meaning the painter cannot transfer them to his nephew. The painter started painting on June 1 and on June 10, he assigned the rights to his nephew. The task is to determine which statement is most accurate regarding this assignment.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The assignment is not a novation because the rights are nonassignable, so no novation occurs.
2. **Option B**: Incorrect. The validity of the assignment is not conditional on the homeowner's consent.
3. **Option C**: Incorrect. The assignment is not effective until the painting is completed, as per the contract.
4. **Option D**: Incorrect. Revocability refers to the ability to cancel the contract, not transfer rights.
5. **Option E**: Incorrect. The assignment is not irrevocable; it depends on whether the contract can be canceled, not on assignable rights.
6. **Option F**: Correct. The contract explicitly states the rights are nonassignable, so the painter's assignment does not relieve the homeowner's liability.
7. **Option G**: Incorrect. Personal service contracts are typically nonassignable, but the homeowner's duty arises from the contract's terms, not their nonassignability.
8. **Option H**: Incorrect. The irrevocability of the assignment is not determined by whether the contract is assignable.
9. **Option I**: Incorrect. The contract does not state that the assignment is unassignable, so the painter must pay the homeowner.
10. **Option F** is the correct answer.

ANSWER: F
