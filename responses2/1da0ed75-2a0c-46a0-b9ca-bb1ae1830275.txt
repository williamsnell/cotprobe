Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which foods are traditionally considered kosher. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.

The question lists eight options: apples, lamb, barley, citrus fruits, beef, shellfish, chicken, and cheese. I need to find out which one isn't considered kosher. I remember that many foods have specific restrictions on what they're allowed to be. 

Starting with apples, I think they're usually considered kosher. I've heard that dairy products like apples are included in the kosher list, but wait, the question is about the specific foods here. So apples are kosher. 

Next, lamb. I'm pretty sure lamb is excluded from kosher meals because it's considered a live animal. So B is not kosher, which might be the answer. But I should check the other options to be sure.

Barley is a type of grain, also known as barley. I recall that grains are typically allowed in kosher meals except for certain ones like sheep's feet. Barley is a common grain, so it's definitely kosher. So C is kosher.

Citrus fruits—like oranges, lemons, etc.—are usually allowed in kosher meals because they're fruits, not animals. So D is kosher.

Beef, I think, is excluded. I've heard that beef is a live animal and is not allowed in kosher. So E is not kosher. But wait, the question is which is not considered, so if E is not kosher, but I need to check the others to make sure.

Shellfish are excluded from kosher. Common ones are salmon, tuna, and shrimps. So F is not kosher.

Chicken is usually allowed in kosher meals. I think it's part of the standard list. So G is kosher.

Cheese—most cheeses are kosher, including goat cheese, Swiss cheese, etc. So H is kosher.

So reviewing the options, the only one that's not considered kosher is E: beef. Even though it's not explicitly mentioned in the other options, I'm pretty confident that beef isn't allowed. 

Wait, but I thought lamb was excluded as well. So B and E both are excluded. But the question asks for which is not considered, so any of them would be correct if the question is about which one is not considered. But looking back, the question is in the context of which is not considered, so if B and E are both excluded, but the question asks for which is not considered, perhaps the answer is E. Wait no, the question is "which of these foods is not traditionally considered kosher?" So the options are all possible choices, and I need to pick one that's not.

Wait, but the options are A to G. The question is which of these is not. So I need to pick the one that's not in the list.

Wait, no, the options are A to G, but the question is about which one is not, so it's possible that the answer is E: beef, because it's not allowed.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. Are all the others allowed except E and B? So the question is asking for which is not considered. So the answer would be E: beef because it's excluded, whereas B: lamb is also excluded. So both B and E are excluded. But the question is which one is not considered, so any of them could be the answer, but perhaps the question implies any one. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is E because it's the one that's explicitly excluded from the list.

Wait, but in the question, the options are A to G, and the question is, which is not considered. So the answer is E: beef because it's not allowed. Alternatively, B: lamb is excluded, but perhaps the question is about which is not considered, and both B and E are correct. But the options are letters A through G, and the answer must be one. So I think the intended answer is E: beef because it's a live animal and isn't allowed. But wait, the question is about which is not considered, so all others are allowed except for E and B, but the question is asking which is not considered, so the answer is E: beef because it's excluded.

Wait, no. Let me check again. Are lamb and beef both excluded? Yes. So both B and E are excluded. But the question is, which is not considered. So the answer could be either B or E. But the options are given as separate letters, and I have to choose one. So perhaps the answer intended is E, because it's explicitly excluded in the list.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the user is asking which is not considered, meaning any of the options except one. But looking at the list, which one is not considered. I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is E: beef because it's excluded from kosher. But wait, I thought the question is about the options given. Let me look again.

The options are A to G. The question is, which is not considered. So the answer is E: beef because it's excluded. Or B: lamb, which is also excluded. So perhaps both B and E are correct, but the options are single letters. Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, so I have to choose one. The options given are A to G, and the question is which is not considered. So the answer is E: beef because it's excluded. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is B: lamb because it's not typically considered. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The question is which of these is not traditionally considered kosher. So all except one. So which one is the exception. Apple is allowed, so A is allowed. Barley is allowed, C is allowed. Citrus is allowed, D is allowed. Beef is not allowed, E is not. Chicken is allowed, G is allowed. So the exception is E: beef. So E is the answer.

The correct answer is E: beef, as it is traditionally excluded from kosher meals due to being a live animal.
