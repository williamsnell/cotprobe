Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which task women typically perform better than men on, based on the question. The question is asking which task, on average, men outperform women, except for one. I remember that there's a lot of research on this, especially in areas related to cognitive performance.

First, I'll go through each option one by one. Let's start with the options. The tasks mentioned are in the options A to J. The question is about which one is the exception. 

Option A: Mental rotation. I think that men generally have better mental rotation skills. I've heard that men are faster and more accurate in these tasks. So, perhaps this is the exception.

Option B: Visual-spatial tasks. I'm not so sure. I've read that women might perform better in certain visual-spatial tasks, but I'm not certain if men outperform women universally. It's possible that women have an advantage in some areas, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Abstract reasoning tests. Hmm, I've heard that women's performance is often better in these tests. For example, studies suggest that women score higher on abstract reasoning tests. So this might be the exception.

Option D: Emotional intelligence. I don't think women generally outperform men on this. Emotionally, men are often more confident and can handle emotional intelligence well, but women might have specific areas where they excel, but it's not a general rule.

Option E: Simultaneous processing. I'm less sure about this. I think both men and women do this well, but it's not the main exception.

Option F: Spatial reasoning. This seems familiar. I remember reading that men perform better in spatial reasoning tasks. Women might have an edge in some areas, but it's not the main exception.

Option G: Memory recall. Men seem to perform better here, especially when it comes to tasks that require holding information in mind. But is this the exception?

Option H: Mathematical problem solving. Men are generally better at this, but again, I'm not sure if it's the exception.

Option I: Target-directed motor skills. I think this is where women might be better, especially in things like hitting targets or precise movements. Men might have an advantage in other motor tasks, but I'm not certain.

Option J: Physical strength tests. I don't think the question is referring to physical strength, especially since the focus is on cognitive tasks. So this is probably not the exception.

So, the options that are the exception are A, C, F, G, I, J. But the question says "on average, men perform better than women on all the following tasks with the exception of". So only one of these is the exception.

I'm trying to remember which is the correct answer. I think the answer is A, C, F, G, I, J, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is asking which task is the exception. I think the most common exception is that men outperform women on spatial reasoning and abstract reasoning. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I'm trying to recall a study. Oh, right, spatial reasoning tasks are often cited as a task where men outperform women. So that would be F: Spatial reasoning.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: in spatial reasoning, both men and women have shown some variation, but I think women sometimes score higher in some subtests, but not universally. So the exception would be when women outperform men on spatial reasoning. So the question is which one is the exception where men are better, so the exception is the task where women are better than men. So the answer is F: Spatial reasoning.

Wait no, wait. The question is which task is the exception where men perform better than women. So the answer is the task where women outperform men. So I think the correct answer is F: Spatial reasoning.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident. Let me double-check. I remember that spatial reasoning is a task where men generally do better than women. So the exception is F.

The task where men outperform women is spatial reasoning. 

Answer: F
