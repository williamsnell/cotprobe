Question:

The hormone which brings about metamorphosis of the cecropia moth is secreted by a gland in the thorax. However, no metamorphosis takes place if the head is cut off, even though the larva continues to live. Explain.

Options:

A: The gland in the thorax is the only gland involved, but it requires a signal from the head to start metamorphosis.
B: Only the gland in the head is necessary for metamorphosis.
C: The gland in the head secretes a different hormone necessary for the initiation of the metamorphosis process.
D: The gland in the thorax secretes the hormone, but the head must be present to activate it.
E: Metamorphosis is triggered by environmental factors, not by hormones secreted by glands.
F: Metamorphosis is controlled by a gland in the abdomen, not the thorax or the head.
G: The head contains an inhibitor that prevents the gland in the thorax from inducing metamorphosis.
H: Neither the gland in the head nor the gland in the thorax are necessary for metamorphosis.
I: Both the gland in the head and the gland in the thorax of the cecropia moth are necessary for the process of metamorphosis.
J: Only the gland in the thorax is necessary for metamorphosis.

Alright, so I've got this question about the cecropia moth and the hormones involved in their metamorphosis. Let me try to break it down.

Okay, the question says that a hormone is secreted by a gland in the thorax, but if the head is cut off, even though the larva lives, no metamorphosis happens. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that some insects undergo metamorphosis, like turning from a larva into a larva of a different stage when their head is removed. But I'm not exactly sure why the head's presence is necessary.

I recall that metamorphosis often involves some sort of signal or trigger. So maybe the molecular pathway isn't just relying on the existing gland. Let me think about the structure of the moth. The head probably has some key parts, like certain structures that might secrete a hormone. The thorax is the area above the head, so that's where the main glands are for development.

Wait, I think I remember from biology that when the head is missing, the process can't proceed. So the head must have some signals. Oh right, the head contains an inhibitor that prevents the development. So the head has a structure that inactivates the necessary signals from the thorax. If the head is there, those signals work; without it, the process fails.

Looking at the options, option E says that the head's presence is necessary to activate the hormone from the thorax. That sounds right. So the hormone is secreted by the thorax, but the head must be present to activate it. Without the head, even though the hormone is there, it can't trigger the transformation because the head serves as an inhibitor.

Let me cross-check the options. Option A says the only gland involved but needs a signal from the head. No, because the head is also necessary. Option B is only the head needed, but the question says the head is not needed. Option C suggests the head secretes a different hormone. I don't think that's what's happening here. Option D says the thorax secretes the hormone and the head is necessary. Option E is the one I thought. Option F, G, and others don't fit. So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: "Metamorphosis is triggered by environmental factors, not by hormones secreted by glands." 

**Explanation:** The cecropia moth undergoes metamorphosis, but this process fails when the head is removed. This is because the head contains an inhibitor that prevents the thorax gland from initiating the transformation. Without the head, the necessary signals from the thorax cannot be activated, leading to no metamorphosis. 

**Answer:** E
