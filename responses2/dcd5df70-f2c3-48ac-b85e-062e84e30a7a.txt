Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about targeted advertising. Let me read the question again carefully. 

The question says it's a form of targeted advertising on websites where advertisements are selected and served by automated systems based on what's displayed to the user. The options are labeled from A to J, each representing a different marketing strategy.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that targeted advertising is a specific type of online advertising where companies select which ads to show based on the user's actions or what they've viewed. This is different from just buying ads as a product.

Let me think about each option:

A: Social media marketing. That's about using social platforms to reach users, but I don't think it's about automated selection based on the user's content. It's more about the platform itself.

B: Display advertising. This sounds like it's where ads are shown in a specific location, like online stores or websites. But again, it's not about automated selection based on user interactions, though I might be mixing up concepts here.

C: Mobile advertising. I know some companies do mobile-specific marketing, targeting devices like phones or tablets. But again, the selection is based on the user's content, not their device.

D: Search engine marketing. That's about using the search engine results to promote products. It's more about the search engine's optimization and not about selecting ads based on user behavior.

E: Contextual advertising. This rings a bell. Contextual ads show content that's relevant to the user's specific situation, like what they've seen before. So I think this is the right answer.

F: Email advertising. That's a different approach, where companies send out emails with ads. But the question mentions automated systems based on what the user is displayed, so email isn't the right choice.

G: Direct marketing. This is about directly buying products from the customer, not using automated systems for selection.

H: Affiliate marketing. That's when a company sells products and others pay to have the links or ads on their site, not based on user targeting.

I: Interactive marketing. Hmm. I'm not sure about this one. It might relate to interactive elements like user engagement, but I can't recall it being the primary form here.

J: Internet advertising. That's a general term, but the question specifies it's targeted, so it's more specific than a general term.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be E: Contextual advertising. It fits because it's about selecting ads based on the content a user is displayed, not the device or other factors.

The correct answer is E: Contextual advertising. This is because contextual advertising involves selecting ads based on the user's displayed content, not other factors like device or time of day. 

Answer: E
