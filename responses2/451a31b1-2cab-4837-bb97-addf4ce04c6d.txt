Question:

A buyer purchased a gallon of nonfat milk from a market. The milk, which was sold in a plastic container, had been processed and packaged by a dairy. That evening, the buyer was preparing dinner and poured himself a glass of milk from the container purchased at the market. He then sat down to eat his meal and proceeded to take a mouthful of milk. As he did so, the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth. He immediately spat out the furry object and saw that it was a dead mouse. The buyer suffered severe emotional distress but did not suffer any physical illness or injury. If the buyer asserts a claim against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing, he will most likely

Options:

A: not recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.
B: recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
C: not recover, because the dairy cannot be proven to have been the source of the mouse.
D: recover, under the theory of strict liability.
E: recover, because he suffered severe emotional distress.
F: recover, because the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to properly package the milk.
G: not recover, because the buyer's proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.
H: recover, because the dairy failed in its duty of care.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a buyer suing a dairy company for negligence. Let's go through the details step by step.

The buyer got a gallon of nonfat milk from the market. It was processed and packaged by a dairy. He then drank it for dinner and later found a dead mouse in his mouth after spitting it out. He had severe emotional distress but no physical problems. Now he's suing the dairy for negligence.

The question is asking which legal principle the buyer will most likely use to recover from the dairy. The options are A to H, each suggesting a different legal theory.

First, I remember that for negligence claims, the key is to determine whether the breach was `strict liability` or if it was `res ipsa loquitur` (the effect of the law). Strict liability means that the plaintiff is immune from liability for their own actions because their actions are inherently negligent. Res ipsa loquitur is when the plaintiff was the cause of their own injury, so their own negligence is liable.

In this case, the buyer's primary harm was severe emotional distress. Emotional distress can't be held to be a strict liability offense because it's not a natural consequence of the action. So, the buyer's claim isn't for strict liability. So options D and G, which suggest strict liability, are probably incorrect.

Next, the buyer is suing the dairy because of their negligence in manufacturing the milk. So, the question is about whether the dairy's breach of duty is the direct cause of the buyer's injuries.

Res ipsa loquitur applies when the plaintiff was the cause of their injury, which would mean that their own negligence is liable. But here, the buyer was not the one negligent. He was injured after his own actions. So, the question is whether the dairy's negligence caused the injury.

I think that the buyer's breach of duty would be considered negligent if the dairy failed to properly package or handle the milk. So, the dairy's breach would be the cause of the injury. That would fit under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. So, if the buyer was the cause of his own injury, then the dairy's negligence is the direct cause.

Looking at the options, E says "recover, because he suffered severe emotional distress." That's a common ground for recovery. But the analysis is about whether the breach of duty caused the injury, not whether the plaintiff was negligent.

Option H says "recover, because the dairy failed in its duty of care." This seems like it's pointing to strict liability, which we already determined isn't the case.

Another point is whether the buyer's proper cause of action is for negligence. The buyer's proper claim is for negligence, but that doesn't automatically make it strict liability. So, E is a possible correct answer.

Wait, but if the buyer was negligent, then it's strict liability if they are the cause of their own harm. But in this case, he wasn't negligentâ€”so it's not strict liability. So option E is about the emotional distress being a cause of action. That's a valid ground, but it's not about being held strictly liable.

So, the buyer's claim is based on negligence. The defense could argue that if the milk was improperly packaged, that's negligence, and that's the cause of the injury. Under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, that's when the plaintiff was the cause of their own injury.

Wait, another thought: The buyer's proper cause of action is negligence. So, if the buyer's own negligence caused his injury, then E would be correct. But the question is about whether the buyer can recover when he is injured after his own actions.

So, the buyer isn't negligent, so strict liability doesn't apply. Then, the issue is whether the buyer's negligence caused his injury, which would support E.

But I also recall another point: The buyer's claim is for negligence, which is a direct cause of his injury. So, the breach of duty is the direct cause.

So, the options are:

E: recover because suffered severe emotional distress. This is a valid cause of action, but again, because it's not strict liability, it doesn't automatically make it a valid claim. But this is more about his own claim, not necessarily about the negligence.

So, the correct answer would be E if the buyer is suing for negligence, but the question is about the theory of negligence.

Wait, the question is about what the buyer will most likely do. The buyer's claim is for negligence. The options are about which theory applies.

So, the correct approach is to analyze the possible theories.

The buyer's claim is that the dairy's failure to properly package (or handle) the milk caused his injury. So, the buyer's negligence is about the packaging. So, the failure of the dairy to package properly is the breach.

Under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the buyer's actions (not negligence) caused his injury. So, the buyer's negligence is the cause of his own injury. So, E is correct.

But wait, another point: Strict liability applies only when the plaintiff is the one injured. Here, the plaintiff was not negligent, so strict liability doesn't come into play. So E doesn't apply.

So, the buyer's proper cause of action is negligence, and the breach of duty is the cause of his injury. So, that would support the E option.

But the question is about the most likely option. The options are:

E: recover because of severe emotional distress.

H: recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care.

H refers to negligence, but the question is about the theory. So, if the buyer's claim is for negligence, and the theory is that the breach caused his injury, then the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but another angle: The buyer's claim is based on negligence. The question is about which theory would make the claim work. So, if the buyer's claim is negligence, and the question is about the reason, then the reason is that the dairy breached its duty.

Wait, the buyer is suing on the basis of negligence, and the question is about which theory he uses.

So, the buyer's claim is negligence, so if the breach of duty is the cause, then E is correct.

But the options are about the reason for recovery. So, the reason is the breach of duty of care.

So, the answer is E because he suffered severe emotional distress as a result of his negligence, which is a valid cause of action.

Wait, but I think E is a valid cause of action, but it's not about the theory of negligence. The question is about what he will most likely recover on, which points to the theory.

The buyer's claim is for negligence. The question is about the reason for recovery. So, if the buyer's claim is based on negligence, and the cause of his injury is the breach of duty, then he can recover under the theory of strict liability only if his claim was for strict liability.

But in this case, his claim is for negligence, so the answer is that the breach of duty caused his injury. So, he can recover under the theory that the breach of duty is the cause.

Wait, but let me think again. If the buyer's claim is based on negligence, then the claim is for negligence, and the reason is the breach of duty. So, the reason is option H, which is "recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care."

But H is about the reason for recovery, not the cause of the injury. The buyer's proper cause is negligence, which is the basis of the claim. So, the reason for recovery would be that the breach of duty is the cause of his injury.

So, in that case, the reason for recovery would be the failure to package properly (option H) as the cause.

Wait, but the options for the reason are presented as separate options. So, the options are:

A: not recover, because dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.

B: recover under res ipsa loquitur.

C: not recover, dairy can't be source.

D: recover under strict liability.

E: recover because of severe emotional distress.

H: recover because of breach of duty.

So, the buyer's claim is for negligence, so the breach is the cause. So, the reasoning is that the breach of duty is the cause of his injury.

So, option H is the cause, but the question is about the reason for recovery. Because the buyer is suing on negligence, the reason for recovery is that the dairy breached its duty of care. So, option H is correct.

Wait, but if the buyer's claim is for negligence, then the reason for recovery is the breach of duty. So, the correct answer is H.

Wait, but no. Because the buyer's claim is based on negligence, the proper cause is negligence. The reason for recovery is the breach of duty. So, the reason is option H.

But I'm getting a bit confused here.

So, the buyer's claim is negligence. The reason for recovery is that the breach of duty is the cause. So, the correct answer is E: because of severe emotional distress, but that's the cause, not the reason for recovery. Alternatively, the reason is H (breach of duty).

Wait, the question is what the buyer will most likely use as the reason for recovery. So, if the claim is based on negligence, the reason is that the breach of duty is the cause.

So, the correct answer is H: recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care.

Wait, but the buyer's claim is that the dairy's failure caused his injury. So, the cause of his injury is the breach of duty. Therefore, the reason is H.

So, the answer should be E or H.

Wait, no. Because the buyer's claim is for negligence, and the reason is the breach of duty. So, the correct answer is H.

But wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let's recap:

The buyer's claim is negligence. The cause of his injury is the breach of duty by the dairy.

So, the reason for recovery is that the breach of duty is the cause of his injury.

So, the answer would be H.

But looking at the options, the choices are about the reason for recovery. So, the buyer's claim is based on negligence, so the reason for recovery is that the breach of duty is the cause. So, option H is the correct reason.

But wait, the buyer's proper cause is negligence, which is the basis for the claim. So, the reason is the breach of duty. So, H is correct.

Alternatively, the buyer's claim is for negligence, which is a valid cause of action. So, E is a correct cause of action, but the question is about the reason for recovery, which is H.

So, the correct answer is H.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. The buyer is suing because he made a mistake (poured milk) leading to injury. The buyer's claim is for negligence. The reason for recovery is that the breach of duty is the cause. So, the answer is H.

But another angle: The buyer's claim is for negligence. The buyer's proper cause of action is negligence. So, the reason for recovery is that the breach of duty is the cause of his injury, making the answer H.

Alternatively, the buyer's claim is for negligence, so if he can prove that his actions were negligent, then he can recover. But in this case, he's suing on negligence, so E is a possible cause of action.

Wait, but the question is about the reason for recovery. The options E and H are about the reason being either emotional distress or breach of duty.

So, the answer is H: because the dairy failed in its duty of care.

Wait, but the buyer's claim is for negligence. So, the reason for recovery would be that the breach of duty is the cause.

So, the answer is H.

Wait, but the buyer's claim is negligence, so he can recover under strict liability if his claim was for strict liability. But that's not the case here. So, the buyer's claim is negligence, so the reason is that the breach of duty is the cause.

So, the correct answer is H.

Wait, but another thought: If the buyer was negligent, then he can recover under strict liability. But in this case, he wasn't negligent. So, the buyer's claim is negligence, not strict liability.

So, the buyer can't recover under strict liability, so E is incorrect. So, the correct reason is that the breach of duty is the cause. So, the answer is H.

So, going through the options:

A: Not recover, due to negligence only cause mental disturbance. Incorrect, because strict liability applies if the claim is strict, but here the claim is negligence.

B: Recover under res ipsa loquitur. Incorrect, because res ipsa loquitur is when the plaintiff is the cause of their own injury, which isn't the case here.

C: Not recover because dairy couldn't be source. Incorrect, because negligence can be shown by breach of duty.

D: Recover under strict liability. Incorrect, because the buyer's claim isn't for strict liability.

E: Recover because of severe emotional distress. This is a valid cause of action, but the reason isn't the negligence.

F: Recover because of breach of duty. This is correct, but E is a cause of action.

G: Not recover because buyer was not negligent. Incorrect, because the buyer can still recover for negligence.

H: Recover because of breach of duty. This is correct.

So, the buyer will most likely claim on the basis of negligence, and the reason is that the dairy failed in its duty of care (option H).

The buyer purchased gallon nonfat milk from a dairy and later suffered severe emotional distress after spitting out dead mouse from his mouth. The buyer asserts a claim against the dairy based on negligence. The question asks which legal theory the buyer will most likely use to recover.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Strict Liability (Option D):** The buyer's claim is for negligence, not strict liability. Strict liability applies only when the plaintiff is immune from liability for their own actions, which is not the case here. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.

2. **Res ipsa Loquitur (Option B):** This doctrine states that the plaintiff was the direct cause of their injury. However, the buyer is not negligent; his injuries resulted from his own actions. Thus, Option B is incorrect.

3. **Not Recover (Option C):** The buyer's claim is valid under the doctrine of negligence because they suffered severe emotional distress, which is a valid cause of action. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.

4. **Not Recover (Option A):** The buyer is not immune to recovery for negligence. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.

5. **Not Recover (Option F):** The buyer's claim is valid under the doctrine of negligence, so they can recover. Therefore, Option F is incorrect.

6. **Recover (Option E):** The buyer's claim is for negligence, and severe emotional distress is a valid cause of action. However, the reason for recovery is not negligence but the breach of duty by the dairy. Therefore, Option E is incorrect.

7. **Recover (Option H):** The buyer's claim is based on negligence, and the breach of duty by the dairy is the direct cause of his injury. Therefore, Option H is correct.

### Conclusion:
The buyer will most likely recover under the doctrine of negligence, with the reason being that the dairy failed in its duty of care.
