Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to use Stokes' Theorem to evaluate a surface integral. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from my vector calculus class.

Stokes' Theorem relates a surface integral over a surface S to a line integral around its boundary curve C. The theorem says that the double integral of the curl of F over S is equal to the line integral of F around C. So, mathematically, it's ∫∫_S curl F · dS = ∮_C F · dr.

Alright, so the problem gives me the vector field F = z² i -3xy j + x³ y³ k. And the surface S is part of the paraboloid z =5 -x² - y² above z=1. So, I need to find the curl of F first.

Calculating the curl. The curl formula is ( ∂Fz/∂y - ∂Fy/∂z ) i - ( ∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x ) j + ( ∂Fy/∂x - ∂Fx/∂y ) k.

Let me compute each component:

For the i component: ∂Fz/∂y. Fz is x³ y³. So, derivative with respect to y is 3x³ y².

Minus ∂Fy/∂z. Fy is -3xy. Its derivative with respect to z is 0, since it's independent of z. So, the i component is 3x³ y².

For the j component: -( ∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x ). Fx is z². Its derivative with respect to z is 2z. Fz is x³ y³, so derivative with respect to x is 3x² y³. So, putting it together: -( (2z) - (3x² y³) ) = -2z + 3x² y³. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The j component is - ( ∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x ). So, ∂Fx/∂z is derivative of z² w.r. to z is 2z. ∂Fz/∂x is derivative of x³ y³ w.r. to x, which is 3x² y³. So, ∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x is 2z - 3x² y³. But it's negative of that, so -(2z - 3x² y³) = -2z + 3x² y³. So, the j component is (3x² y³ - 2z).

Now the k component: ∂Fy/∂x - ∂Fx/∂y. Fy is -3xy. Derivative w.r. to x is -3y. Fx is z², derivative w.r. to y is 0. So, the k component is (-3y) - 0 = -3y.

So putting it all together, curl F is (3x³ y²) i + (3x² y³ - 2z) j + (-3y) k.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the j component. Let me recheck. The curl j component is -( ∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x ). So, that's - ( 2z - 3x² y³ ). So, it's -2z +3x² y³. So, the j component is (3x² y³ - 2z).

But wait, I think I might have messed up the signs. Let me recompute the curl step by step.

The curl F is calculated as:

First component: ∂F_z/∂y - ∂F_y/∂z.

F_z is x³ y³, so ∂F_z/∂y is 3x³ y².

F_y is -3xy, so ∂F_y/∂z is 0. So first component is 3x³ y².

Second component (j) is -( ∂F_x/∂z - ∂F_z/∂x ).

F_x is z², so ∂F_x/∂z is 2z.

F_z is x³ y³, so ∂F_z/∂x is 3x² y³.

So, second component becomes -( (2z) - (3x² y³) ) = -2z + 3x² y³.

Third component (k) is ∂F_y/∂x - ∂F_x/∂y.

F_y is -3xy, so ∂F_y/∂x is -3y.

F_x is z², so ∂F_x/∂y is 0.

So, third component is (-3y) - 0 = -3y.

So, curl F = (3x³ y²) i + (3x² y³ -2z) j + (-3y) k.

Okay, that seems correct.

Now, according to Stokes' Theorem, I can compute the surface integral by computing the line integral around the boundary curve C of F.

The surface S is the paraboloid z=5 -x² -y² above z=1. So, the boundary curve C is the intersection of this surface with the plane z=1.

Setting z=1 in the paraboloid equation: 1 =5 -x² -y² → x² + y² =4. So, the boundary is a circle of radius 2 in the plane z=1, centered at the origin.

So, the curve C is the circle x² + y²=4, z=1. To parameterize this, I can use polar coordinates.

Let's parameterize C as r(t) = 2 cos t i + 2 sin t j + k, where t goes from 0 to 2π.

So, the parameterization is:

x = 2 cos t

y = 2 sin t

z = 1

The tangent vector dr/dt would be (-2 sin t, 2 cos t, 0).

Alternatively, I can write it as r(t) = (2 cos t, 2 sin t, 1), and dr/dt = (-2 sin t, 2 cos t, 0).

Now, I need to compute the line integral ∮_C F · dr, where F is given.

F at any point (x, y, z) is z² i -3xy j + x³ y³ k.

So, on the curve C, z=1, so F becomes (1)^2 i -3xy j + (x³ y³) k.

Which is i -3xy j + x³ y³ k.

So, F = (1, -3xy, x³ y³) along C.

Now, the line integral is the integral from t=0 to t=2π of F(r(t)) · dr/dt dt.

So, let's compute F(r(t)) · dr/dt.

F(r(t)): x=2 cos t, y=2 sin t.

So,

F_x = 1,

F_y = -3*(2 cos t)*(2 sin t) = -3*4 cos t sin t = -12 cos t sin t.

F_z = (2 cos t)^3 (2 sin t)^3 = 8 cos^3 t * 8 sin^3 t = 64 cos^3 t sin^3 t.

Wait, wait: (2 cos t)^3 is 8 cos³ t, (2 sin t)^3 is 8 sin³ t. So, F_z is 8*8 * cos³ t sin³ t = 64 cos³ t sin³ t.

So, F is (1, -12 cos t sin t, 64 cos³ t sin³ t).

Now, dr/dt is (-2 sin t, 2 cos t, 0).

So, the dot product F · dr/dt is:

(1)*(-2 sin t) + (-12 cos t sin t)*(2 cos t) + (64 cos³ t sin³ t)*0.

Compute each term:

First term: 1*(-2 sin t) = -2 sin t.

Second term: (-12 cos t sin t)*(2 cos t) = -24 cos² t sin t.

Third term: 0.

So, the total is -2 sin t -24 cos² t sin t.

Factor out -2 sin t:

= -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t).

Wait, wait: 1 is multiplied by -2 sin t, and 12 cos² t multiplied by -2 sin t.

So, (1)*(-2 sin t) + (12 cos^2 t)*(-2 sin t) = -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t).

Wait, no: the second term is (-24 cos² t sin t) = -24 cos² t sin t.

Which is -24 sin t cos² t. So, factoring out -2 sin t:

= -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t).

Wait, because 1 + 12 cos² t is 1 + 12 cos² t → if I factor out -2 sin t:

= -2 sin t [1 + 12 cos² t]? Wait, no, no.

Wait, the expression is -2 sin t (1) from the first term, and -24 cos² t sin t (from the second term). Factor out -2 sin t:

= -2 sin t [1 + 12 cos² t] ?

Wait, because -24 cos² t sin t = (-2 sin t) * 12 cos² t.

So, factor as -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t).

So, the integrand is -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t).

So, the line integral is the integral from 0 to 2π of [ -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t) ] dt.

Let me write that as ∫₀^{2π} -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t) dt.

Hmm. That's the integral to compute.

Let me simplify the integrand.

First, factor out the constants:

-2 ∫ sin t (1 + 12 cos² t) dt.

= -2 ∫ [ sin t (1) + 12 sin t cos² t ] dt.

So, split into two integrals:

= -2 [ ∫ sin t dt + 12 ∫ sin t cos² t dt ].

Let me compute each integral.

First integral: ∫ sin t dt from 0 to 2π.

The integral of sin t is -cos t. Evaluated from 0 to 2π.

- [ cos(2π) - cos(0) ] = - [1 - 1] = 0.

Second integral: ∫ sin t cos² t dt.

Let me use substitution. Let u = cos t → du = -sin t dt.

So, the integral becomes ∫ u² (-du) → -∫ u² du = -(u³/3) ) + C.

Evaluated from t=0 to t=2π:

But wait, let's see. The integral is from 0 to 2π of sin t cos² t dt.

Which is ∫ u² (-du) = - [ u³/3 ] from u=cos 0=1 to u=cos 2π=1.

So, it's - [ (1)^3/3 - (1)^3/3 ] = 0.

Wait, because u starts at 1 when t=0, and ends at 1 when t=2π. So, it's 1 -1 =0.

So the integral of sin t cos² t from 0 to 2π is zero.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Wait, let me double-check that substitution.

Let me do it step by step.

∫ sin t cos² t dt from 0 to 2π.

Let u = cos t → du = - sin t dt → -du = sin t dt.

So, the integral becomes ∫ u² (-du) → - ∫ u² du = - (u³/3) + C.

Evaluated between t=0 and t=2π: u at t=0 is 1, at t=2π is also 1.

So, [ - (1³/3) ] - [ - (1³/3) ] = (-1/3) - (-1/3) = 0.

So, ∫ sin t cos² t dt from 0 to 2π is zero.

So, the second integral is 12 * 0 = 0.

So, putting it together, the line integral is -2 [ 0 + 0 ] = 0.

Wait, but that's the result. So, according to Stokes' Theorem, the surface integral is equal to this line integral, which is zero. So the answer is zero.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with line integrals, it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, let's see: when I parameterized C, I had r(t) = (2 cos t, 2 sin t, 1), so dr/dt is (-2 sin t, 2 cos t, 0).

F(r(t)) is (1, -12 cos t sin t, 64 cos³ t sin³ t).

Dot product F · dr/dt:

1*(-2 sin t) + (-12 cos t sin t)*(2 cos t) + 64 cos³ t sin³ t *0.

So, -2 sin t -24 cos² t sin t.

Factor as -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t).

Then, the integral over 0 to 2π becomes ∫-2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t) dt.

Which splits into -2 [ ∫ sin t dt + 12 ∫ sin t cos^2 t dt ].

The first integral is zero. The second integral is zero, as we found. So the entire line integral is zero.

So, according to Stokes' Theorem, the surface integral is zero. So the answer is E: 0.0.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the parameterization correct?

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without computing the line integral, perhaps noticing symmetries or something else.

Wait, perhaps using a vector field which is conservative, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using a potential function, but I think it's more straightforward to compute the line integral, which we've done, and it's zero.

Alternatively, another approach: maybe the curl of F is zero, making the surface integral zero. But let's check the curl.

Wait, wait, let me compute the curl again, maybe I made a mistake.

Original F is z² i -3xy j + x³ y³ k.

Compute curl F:

i component: ∂(x³ y³)/∂y - ∂(-3xy)/∂z.

= 3x³ y² - 0 → 3x³ y².

j component: ∂(z²)/∂z - ∂(x³ y³)/∂x → 2z - 3x² y³ → but wait no, the j component is -( ∂F_x/∂z - ∂F_z/∂x ), which is ∂F_x/∂z is 2z, ∂F_z/∂x is 3x² y³. So j component is -(2z - 3x² y³) → -2z +3x² y³.

k component: ∂(-3xy)/∂x - ∂(z²)/∂y → -3y -0 → -3y.

So, curl F is (3x³ y²) i + (3x² y³ - 2z) j + (-3y) k.

Wait, not zero. So, the curl is not zero, so the surface integral is not necessarily zero. So why is the line integral zero?

Wait, but according to Stokes' Theorem, the integral over the surface S is equal to the line integral around C. So, if the line integral is zero, the surface integral is zero as well.

But let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the parameterization of C.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a different parameterization of C. Alternatively, maybe the surface integral is zero because the vector field is such that the curl is zero along some symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I found that the line integral is zero, so the surface integral must be zero.

Wait, but the problem gives options including 0.0, which is option E. So perhaps the answer is E:0.0.

Wait, but let me think again, perhaps I made an error in the line integral calculation. Let me recheck.

The integrand was -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t) dt, integrated from 0 to 2π.

The integral of sin t from 0 to 2pi is zero. The integral of 12 sin t cos^2 t dt from 0 to 2pi is zero because cos^2 t is symmetric over 0 to 2pi, and multiplied by sin t.

So, the integrand is an odd function in t? Wait, not exactly, but the integral over a full period of sin and cos terms may cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral of sin t (1 + 12 cos² t) dt from 0 to 2π is zero.

Wait, since the integrand is an odd function in t, but let's think about the period.

Wait, consider the function f(t) = sin t (1 + 12 cos² t).

Let me make a substitution u = t - pi.

Wait, perhaps f(t) is an odd function around t=pi. Let me see:

f(pi + s) = sin(pi + s) * [1 + 12 cos²(pi + s)].

sin(pi +s) = -sin s.

cos(pi + s) = -cos s.

So cos²(pi +s) = cos² s.

So, f(pi + s) = (-sin s) [1 + 12 cos² s ].

Which is -sin s (1 +12 cos² s ) = -f(s).

So f(pi +s ) = -f(s). So for the integral from s=0 to s=pi, it's (1/2) ∫ f(s) ds from 0 to pi, and similarly for the other half.

Wait, but perhaps the integral over 0 to 2pi is zero, because the function is symmetric in a way that the positive and negative areas cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps because the integral is from 0 to 2pi, and the function is symmetric, the overall integral is zero.

So, the line integral is zero, hence the surface integral is zero.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: 0.0.
</think>

To evaluate the surface integral ∫∫_S curl F · dS using Stokes' Theorem, we first compute the curl of F.

Given F = z² i -3xy j + x³ y³ k, the curl is calculated as:

- i component: ∂Fz/∂y - ∂Fy/∂z = 3x³ y² - 0 = 3x³ y².
- j component: -(∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x) = -(2z - 3x² y³) = -2z + 3x² y³.
- k component: ∂Fy/∂x - ∂Fx/∂y = (-3y) - 0 = -3y.

Thus, curl F = (3x³ y²) i + (3x² y³ - 2z) j + (-3y) k.

Next, we identify the boundary curve C of the surface S, which is the intersection of the paraboloid z = 5 - x² - y² with the plane z = 1. This gives the circle C: x² + y² = 4, z = 1.

We parameterize C as r(t) = (2 cos t, 2 sin t, 1), where t ∈ [0, 2π]. The tangent vector dr/dt is (-2 sin t, 2 cos t, 0).

We compute F(r(t)) at the parameterized point:

- F(r(t)) = (1, -12 cos t sin t, 64 cos³ t sin³ t).

The line integral is then:

∫₀²π F(r(t)) · dr/dt dt = ∫₀²π [1*(-2 sin t) + (-12 cos t sin t)*(2 cos t) + (64 cos³ t sin³ t)*0] dt.

Simplifying the integrand:

= ∫₀²π (-2 sin t - 24 cos² t sin t) dt
= ∫₀²π -2 sin t (1 + 12 cos² t) dt.

Splitting the integral:

= -2 [ ∫₀²π sin t dt + 12 ∫₀²π sin t cos² t dt ].

- The first integral, ∫₀²π sin t dt, evaluates to 0.
- The second integral, ∫₀²π sin t cos² t dt, evaluates to 0 due to the periodic nature of the functions.

Thus, the line integral is 0, and by Stokes' Theorem, the surface integral ∫∫_S curl F · dS is also 0.
