Question:

A package of paper towels has 12 rolls of paper towels in it. Mr. Kelly wants to put an equal number of rolls of paper towels into 4 rooms. He uses the number sentence below to find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room. 12 ÷ t = 4 Which number sentence shows another way Mr. Kelly can find the number of rolls of paper towels, t, he should put into each room?

Options:

A: 12 – t = 4
B: 4 ÷ 12 = t
C: 4 × t = 12
D: t – 4 = 12
E: 4 + 12 = t
F: 4 – t = 12
G: t + 4 = 12
H: t ÷ 4 = 12

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about Mr. Kelly distributing paper towel rolls into rooms. He has 12 rolls and wants to put an equal number into 4 rooms. The initial equation given is 12 ÷ t = 4, and they're asking which other number sentence can show another way to find t.

Hmm, let me think. So, the original equation is 12 divided by t equals 4. That makes sense because if you have 12 rolls and you divide them into t rooms, each room gets 4 rolls. So, 12 divided by the number of rooms (t) gives you the number of rolls per room (4).

Now, they're asking for another way to find t. So, I need to find an equation that's equivalent but perhaps rearranged. Let me think about the different ways to solve for t in this problem.

The original equation is 12 ÷ t = 4. To find t, I can rearrange it. Let's see, when you have an equation like a/b = c, you can solve for b by multiplying both sides by b and then dividing by c. So, rearranging 12 ÷ t = 4, if I multiply both sides by t, I get 12 = 4t. Then, dividing both sides by 4 would give t = 12 ÷ 4, which is 3. So, 12 ÷ t = 4 leads to t = 3.

Looking at the answer options, option C is 4 × t = 12. Let me see if that's another way. If 4 multiplied by t equals 12, then solving for t gives t=3, which is the same as before. So t=3 is the solution.

Alternatively, maybe other options can lead to the same solution. Let's check each option:

A: 12 – t = 4 → solving for t gives t=8. But that's not correct because 12 ÷8 would be 1.5, not 4. So no.

B: 4 ÷ 12 = t → 4/12 is 1/3, so t=1/3. That's wrong because we can't have a fraction of a roll in this context.

C: 4 × t = 12 → t=3. Correct.

D: t –4 =12 → t=16. No, 16 ×4 is 64, which is not 12.

E: 4 +12 = t → t=16. Which is same as D. So that's incorrect.

F: 4 – t =12 → t= -8. Negative rolls don't make sense.

G: t +4 =12 → t=8. Which is same as A. So 8×4=32, which is not 12. So incorrect.

H: t ÷4=12 → t=48. Which is way too big.

So the only correct equation is option C: 4 × t = 12.

The correct equation is C: 4 × t = 12. This represents the same relationship as the original equation, allowing t to be found by rearranging to t = 12 ÷ 4 = 3.

Answer: C
