Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find how many different 6-letter arrangements can be made from the letters in the word BANANA. Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, I should probably think about the letters in BANANA. Let me write them out: B, A, N, A, N, A. Wait, that's B, then three A's, and two N's. Oh right, so the word BANANA has 6 letters with repetitions. 

So, the letters are B, A, A, A, N, N. Or more accurately, the counts are: B appears once, A appears three times, and N appears two times. So when we're trying to arrange these letters, we have to account for the repetitions because letters can't be distinguished from each other beyond their count.

The question is about 6-letter arrangements, but the original word is 6 letters long. So, I think the task is to find all possible anagrams of the word BANANA, but considering that some letters are repeated.

Wait, but BANANA is 6 letters. So the question is about how many unique 6-letter arrangements can be made from these letters. But since BANANA is exactly 6 letters, the arrangements would just be all permutations of BANANA. But wait, that's not exactly right because some letters are repeated. So the formula for permutations of multiset comes to mind.

I remember that the formula for permutations when there are duplicates is n! divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each duplicated item. In this case, n is 6. The letters are B, A, A, A, N, N. So, the counts are B:1, A:3, N:2.

So the total number of unique arrangements should be 6! divided by (3! * 2! * 1!). Let me compute that.

6! is 720.

3! is 6, 2! is 2, and 1! is 1. So denominator is 6 * 2 * 1 = 12.

So 720 / 12 = 60. So the total number of unique arrangements is 60.

Wait, but the options given are A:240, B:120, C:20, D:60, E:180, F:30, G:360, H:720, I:450, J:90.

So D is 60, which matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be D.

The number of unique 6-letter arrangements is determined by the permutations of the multiset {B, A, A, A, N, N}. The formula is 6!/(3!2!) = 720/(6*2) = 60. 

Answer: D: 60
