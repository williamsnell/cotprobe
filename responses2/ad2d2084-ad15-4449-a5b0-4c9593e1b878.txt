Okay, so I've got this question about finding the mode or modes of a sample. The sample given is 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. So, I need to check how many times each number appears. Let's list them out and count.

Looking at the numbers: 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9.

Let's count each one:

- 6 appears once.
- 7 appears twice.
- 3 appears twice.
- 8 appears once.
- 5 appears once.
- 9 appears once.

So, the counts are: 6:1, 7:2, 3:2, 8:1, 5:1, 9:1.

Wait, so 7 and 3 each appear twice, which is more than the others. So, in this data set, both 7 and 3 appear most frequently. So the modes are 7 and 3.

Looking at the options, option F is "6, 7, and 3." Wait no, because 6 only appears once. So that's not the case. Option G says 5 and 9, which doesn't make sense because they only appear once. Option B says 6,7,8. No, those are all single counts except 7 and 3. Option C is 7 only. But 3 also appears twice, so C is incorrect. Option D is 6 and 9—same problem. Option E is 6 and 8—still single counts. Option I is 3 and 7, which is exactly what I found. So the correct answer should be I: 3 and 7.

Wait a minute, but I thought the correct answer was E or I? Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in the sample, numbers 3 and 7 each appear twice, while 6 and 8, 5, and 9 appear once. So the modes are 3 and 7. So the correct mode is both 3 and 7. Looking at the options, option I says 3 and 7, so that's the correct one.

But wait, looking back, the options are A to J. Option I is 3 and 7. So the answer should be I. But I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought option F was the answer, but that's not correct. Let's see: option F is "6, 7, and 3". Wait, no, 6 appears once, so it's not a mode. So F is incorrect.

Wait, the correct answer is 3 and 7, which is option I. So I think the correct choice is option I.

The sample provided is 6, 7, 7, 3, 8, 5, 3, 9. To find the mode, we count the frequency of each number:

- 6: 1
- 7: 2
- 3: 2
- 8: 1
- 5: 1
- 9: 1

Both 7 and 3 appear twice, which is more than any other number. Therefore, the modes are 7 and 3. Among the options, the correct one is **I: 3 and 7**. 

Answer: I
