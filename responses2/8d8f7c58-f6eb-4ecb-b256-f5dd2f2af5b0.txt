Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the volume of a rectangular tank. The question gives me the dimensions in meters, centimeters, and millimeters, and I need to find the volume in liters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but I think I can figure this out step by step.

Alright, let's break it down. The dimensions are 2.0 meters, 50 centimeters, and 200 millimeters. Wait, all these units are in different metric prefixes. Oh right, meters, centimeters, and millimeters. I remember that 1 meter is 100 centimeters, and 1 centimeter is 10 millimeters. So maybe I can convert all these to a single unit to make it easier.

Let's choose centimeters because it's in the middle. So, 2.0 meters is how many centimeters? Oh, right, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 2.0 m is 200 cm. Then, 50 cm is already in centimeters, so that stays the same. And 200 mm is how many centimeters? Oh, 1 cm is 10 mm, so 200 mm is 20 cm. Wait, no, wait. 200 divided by 10 is 20. So, that's 20 cm.

Wait, let me double-check. 200 mm is 20 cm? Because 1 cm is 10 mm, so 200 mm is 200 / 10 = 20 cm. Oh right, so that part's correct.

So now all the dimensions in centimeters are 200 cm (length), 50 cm (width), and 20 cm (height). Now, the formula for the volume of a rectangular tank is length × width × height. So I'll multiply these three together.

Calculating that: 200 cm * 50 cm * 20 cm. Let's compute that step by step. 

First, 200 * 50 is 10,000. Then, 10,000 * 20 is 200,000. So the volume is 200,000 cubic centimeters. Wait, because volume is in cm³.

But the question asks for liters. I remember that 1 liter is equal to 1000 cubic centimeters. So to convert cm³ to liters, I divide by 1000. So 200,000 cm³ divided by 1000 equals 200 liters.

Looking at the options, option C is 100 liters, G is 200 liters, so it's G.

Wait, wait a second. Did I convert all the units correctly? Let me check again. 2.0 m is 200 cm, correct. 50 cm is 50 cm. 200 mm is 20 cm. Multiplying 200 * 50 = 10,000, then *20=200,000 cm³. 200,000 / 1000 = 200 liters. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be G, 200 liters.

The volume of the rectangular tank can be calculated by converting all dimensions to centimeters and then using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism. The dimensions are 200 cm (length), 50 cm (width), and 20 cm (height). The volume is 200 cm × 50 cm × 20 cm = 200,000 cm³. Since 1 liter equals 1000 cm³, the volume is 200,000 / 1000 = 200 liters. 

Answer: G
