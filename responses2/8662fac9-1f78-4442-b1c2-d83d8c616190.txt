Okay, so I've got this problem about the half-life of radon. Hmm, I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. The question says the half-life of radon is 3.80 days. I need to find out after how many days only one-sixteenth of the radon sample remains.

Wait, right. So when a substance decays, each half-life reduces the quantity by half. But how does the number of half-lives relate to the remaining quantity? Oh right, it's an exponential decay process.

So the formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where N is the remaining amount, N0 is the initial amount, t is the time, and T is the half-life. I think I can rearrange this to solve for t.

But wait, in this case, I want to find the time when only 1/16 remains. That means N = N0 / 16. So let's plug that into the formula.

1/16 = (1/2)^(t / 3.80)

Taking natural logs might help here. Remember ln(a^b) = b*ln(a). So taking ln on both sides:

ln(1/16) = (t / 3.80) * ln(1/2)

I can solve for t. Let me compute the logarithms.

ln(1/16) is ln(0.0625), which is ln(16) * (-1). Because 1/16 is 0.0625, and ln(1/16) = -ln(16). Similarly, ln(1/2) is -ln(2).

So substituting:

- ln(16) = (t / 3.80) * (- ln(2))

The negatives cancel out, so ln(16) = (t / 3.80) * ln(2)

Then, t = (ln(16) / ln(2)) * 3.80

Wait, ln(16) is ln(2^4) which is 4 ln 2. So substituting:

t = (4 ln 2) / ln 2 * 3.80 â†’ The ln2 terms cancel, so t = 4 * 3.80 days.

4 times 3.80 is 15.2 days. So the answer should be 15.2 days.

Looking at the options, option H is 15.2 days. So the correct answer is H.

To determine after how many days only one-sixteenth of the radon sample remains, we use the concept of half-life. The formula for radioactive decay is:

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{T}}
\]

Here, \( N = \frac{N_0}{16} \), and the half-life \( T \) is 3.80 days. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{16} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{3.80}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{16}\right) = \frac{t}{3.80} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(16) = \frac{t}{3.80} \cdot \ln(2)
\]

Since \( \ln(16) = 4\ln(2) \), the equation becomes:

\[
4\ln(2) = \frac{t}{3.80} \cdot \ln(2)
\]

Canceling \( \ln(2) \) from both sides:

\[
t = 4 \cdot 3.80 = 15.2 \, \text{days}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **15.2 days**, which corresponds to option **H**.
