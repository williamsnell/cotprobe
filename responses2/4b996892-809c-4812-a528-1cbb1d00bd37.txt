Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.
â€”Voltaire, in a letter, 1755

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is for this multiple-choice question about Voltaire and Enlightenment intellectuals. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about what Voltaire's quote indicates about the characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals. The options are A to J, each describing different aspects. Voltaire's quote is about the suffering and disaster caused by human life, which is a pretty intense and serious statement. The idea is that the laws of movement and survival are so harsh that such events are inevitable.

Looking at the options:

A: They believed in preserving traditional religious doctrines. Well, Voltaire wasn't a religious person. He was more about the idea of man as a species and the moral implications of such events. So maybe this isn't the main point.

B: They rejected religion and went for atheism. Again, Voltaire wrote about the moral and ethical implications rather than rejecting religion outright. So probably not B.

C: They were disconnected from the common people. Well, this seems a bit off. Voltaire did care about the common people, but his focus was on the moral and philosophical aspects of their existence, not the social disconnect. So this might not be the best fit.

D: They believed in monarchies and aristocracies. Voltaire doesn't seem to express any particular stance on politics or governance. His main focus was on the moral and philosophical ideas, not the political structure.

E: They believed human suffering is inevitable. Voltaire explicitly mentions that in his quote. He's talking about the consequences of human actions and the suffering caused by them. So this seems directly related.

F: They rejected scientific impacts on social issues. Voltaire didn't support science, but his quote is more about the moral and ethical implications. So I don't think F is correct.

G: They advocated for abolishing governance. Voltaire's views aren't about abolishing governance; he's more about the moral and philosophical aspects. So G is unlikely.

H: They used salons and pamphlets. That's more about the media communication methods. Voltaire was involved in political and scientific circles, but his primary focus was on the philosophical and moral side, so H doesn't fit.

I: They believed new discoveries justify a more open approach. Voltaire's quote is about the inevitable consequences of human actions, not necessarily on how to handle them. So I might not agree with I.

J: They were accomplished scientists. Voltaire's work was more philosophical and scientific, but I'm not sure if he was a scientist themselves. He did write about scientific discoveries, but his focus is on the moral implications, not the scientific methods. So J might not be correct either.

Wait, but the question is about characteristics, not about Voltaire's own beliefs. The options are general characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals. 

Voltaire's quote suggests that he was seeing the consequences of human actions. So the characteristics might relate to people being aware of the impact of their actions, not necessarily their beliefs.

Looking back, option E says they believed human suffering is inevitable. Voltaire's quote does mention that, so that's likely the answer.

So the correct answer is E.
</think>

The correct answer is **E: They believed that human suffering and disasters are inevitable and justified.**

Voltaire's quote reflects his awareness of the consequences of human actions, particularly the suffering caused by them. This aligns with the Enlightenment's emphasis on the inevitability of suffering and the moral justification of such events. 

**Answer: E**
