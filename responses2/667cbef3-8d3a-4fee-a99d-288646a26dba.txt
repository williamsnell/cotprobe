Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the mass and volume of an atom. Hmm, let me think about it.

The question is asking what contributes most to the mass and most to the volume of an atom. The options are A to J, each pairing different particles. I remember from my chemistry class that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

Wait, protons have a positive charge, neutrons are neutral, and electrons are negative. Electrons orbit the nucleus and contribute to the atom's mass because they have mass as well. So the mass of the atom should mainly come from the protons and neutrons because they make up the core.

Now, for the volume part. The nucleus is where most of the atom's mass is because it's really dense. The electrons are in the outer shell, so their volume doesn't contribute much to the overall size of the atom. So the volume comes mostly from the nucleus, which is made up of protons and neutrons.

Let me look at the options again. Option C says protons; neutrons. That makes sense because protons are in the nucleus, neutrons are there too. So the mass comes from protons and neutrons, and volume from the nucleus which is made of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the question says "mass" and "volume from". So for mass, it's the sum of protons and neutrons. For volume, it's the size of the nucleus, which comes from protons and neutrons as well. So the volume is due to the nucleons (protons and neutrons together) because they are the ones contributing to the dense core.

Looking at the options:

A: neutrons; electrons → No, electrons don't contribute much to mass or volume.
B: protons; electrons → No, electrons don't contribute to mass, and the volume is from nucleus.
C: protons; neutrons → Both are in the nucleus, so this fits.
D: electrons; electrons → No, electrons don't contribute to mass.
E: nucleons; electrons → nucleons are protons and neutrons; electrons don't contribute to mass. So E is not correct.
F: nucleons; nucleons → That would mean mass and volume are both from nucleons, which is correct. But the question says mass comes from... which is the sum of protons and neutrons. Oh wait, nucleons are the actual particles in the nucleus. So nucleons would include both. But the options for the first part are protons and neutrons. Wait, the question's first part says, mass comes from, and options are A: neutrons; B: protons; C: protons and neutrons.

Wait, the first part: "mass comes mostly from its..." So the correct answer for mass is protons and neutrons. For volume, the nuclear density, which comes from the number of nucleons (protons + neutrons), so the volume is due to nucleons.

Looking at the options, option E says nucleons for both. But the options C and E have different first parts.

Wait, the options C says protons and neutrons are the mass contributors, and option E says nucleons contribute to both. But the question says, the mass comes from _ ; volume from _.

Wait, the options are paired: each option pair gives what contributes to mass and what to volume.

So the correct answer is C: protons; neutrons for mass, volume from nucleons (which is both protons and neutrons). Wait, no, the second part of the question is, "and its volume from its _." So, the second part is the volume contributed by something.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The question is: the mass comes from, and volume comes from. So looking for the first blank (mass) to be either protons, neutrons, or nucleons, and the second blank (volume) as the part that contributes to the volume.

So the options are each pair. For example, option E says nucleons for mass, electrons for volume. So that can't be right because I thought the volume comes from the nucleus (protons and neutrons).

Option C: mass from protons and neutrons, volume from nucleons. That's correct because the volume is due to the number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) in the nucleus.

But wait, looking at the options, option E says volume is electrons. So that's not correct. Option C says the second part is nucleons, which is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

The mass of an atom primarily comes from its protons and neutrons, which are located in the nucleus. These particles contribute significantly to the atom's mass. For the volume, the nucleus is where the majority of the atom's volume resides, and this volume is determined by the number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the nucleus.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C**: Protons and neutrons are the contributors to mass, and nucleons (which include both protons and neutrons) are the contributors to volume. This matches the correct understanding.
- Other options either incorrectly attribute contributions to mass or volume or mix the concepts.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: protons; neutrons**.
