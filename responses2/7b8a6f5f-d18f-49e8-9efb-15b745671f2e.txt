Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: -17.02 equals -2.3 times y. Hmm, I need to find what y is. Let me think about how to approach this.

So the equation is -17.02 = -2.3y. I remember that to solve for y, I need to isolate it. Since y is being multiplied by -2.3, I should divide both sides by -2.3 to get y by itself. 

Wait, but dividing both sides by a negative number will change the signs. Let me write this out step by step. 

So, if I have -17.02 = -2.3y, I'll divide both sides by -2.3. That would look like:

y = (-17.02) / (-2.3)

Now, when you divide two negative numbers, the result is positive. So the negatives cancel out, and I'm left with a positive number.

Let me do the division. I need to divide 17.02 by 2.3 to find the value. To make this easier, maybe I can adjust the numbers to make division simpler. 

Alternatively, I can think about how many times 2.3 goes into 17.02. Let me try that. 

2.3 times 7 is 16.1, because 2.3 * 7 = 16.1. Then, subtracting that from 17.02 gives me 0.92. So after the 7, there's 0.92 left. 

Now, how much is 0.92 divided by 2.3? Well, 2.3 goes into 0.92 exactly 0.4 times because 2.3 * 0.4 = 0.92. 

So adding that together, 7 plus 0.4 gives me 7.4. So y equals 7.4.

Wait, but I should check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me plug 7.4 back into the original equation.

-2.3 times 7.4 equals what? Let me calculate that. 

2.3 * 7 is 16.1, and 2.3 * 0.4 is 0.92. Adding those together gives 16.1 + 0.92 = 17.02. But since both are negative, it's -17.02. 

Which matches the left side of the equation, so yes, y equals 7.4 is correct. 

Looking at the options, option E is 7.4. So the answer should be E.

The solution involves isolating y by dividing both sides by -2.3, resulting in y = 7.4. Checking this, -2.3 * 7.4 equals -17.02, confirming the solution.

Answer: E: 7.4
