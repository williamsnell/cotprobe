Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question in front of me. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question is about designing an electrochemical cell using Li and Cl2. I remember that electrochemical cells involve spontaneous redox reactions and the calculation of cell potential. 

Wait, the materials are Li and Cl2, so I think this has to do with electrolysis or oxidation. Oh right, because Li is a metal and Cl2 is diatomic, so maybe it's a displacement reaction where Li is oxidized and Cl2 is reduced.

The cell notation is Li | LiCl(fused salt) | Cl2. So, the first part is the anode and the anode is where oxidation happens. The cathode is where reduction occurs. So, in this case, since Li is the metal, it's likely being oxidized. So the anode reaction would be Li → Li+ + e^- (oxidation). But wait, LiCl is a salt solution, so maybe it's Li+ and Cl- ions.

Wait, but since Li is a metal, when it dissolves, it's going to lose electrons. But Cl2 is a diatomic gas, so in the cathode, it's being reduced. The reduction of Cl2 would be Cl2 + 2e^- → 2Cl^-.

So the cell reaction would involve the transfer of electrons. Let me think about the overall cell reaction. The anode is oxidation, producing electrons, and the cathode is reduction, accepting those electrons.

So for the anode: Li → Li+ + e^-
But since it's a positive electrode, maybe it's better to write it as Li → Li+ + e^- (oxidation, losing electrons). For the cathode, Cl2 + 2e^- → 2Cl^-.

So combining the two, Li (oxidized) + Cl2 (reduced) → LiCl. But wait, how about the stoichiometry? Let me balance the electrons.

Each Li loses one electron. Each Cl2 gains two electrons. So for the overall reaction, the number of electrons should be the same. Let's see: 

Anode: Li → Li+ + e^- (each Li loses 1e^-)
Cathode: Cl2 + 2e^- → 2Cl^- (each Cl2 gains 2e^-)

So to balance, the number of electrons lost should equal electrons gained. So for each mole of Li, 1 mole of electrons are lost. For each mole of Cl2, 2 moles are gained. So the ratio would be based on these numbers.

So the overall cell reaction is Li + Cl2 → 2LiCl. Let me check the electrons: 1 Li gives 1 e^-, and Cl2 gives 2 e^- per mole. So in the reaction, 1 mole of Li contributes 1 e^-, and 1 mole of Cl2 contributes 2 e^-. Wait, but the way the electrons flow is that the electrons from Li (oxidation) go to Cl2 (reduction). So the electrons from Li (1 per Li) go to Cl2 (2 per Cl2). So to balance, we need 2 electrons from Li to go to Cl2.

So 1 mole of Li gives 1 mole of e^−. To have 2 e^−, we need 2 Li atoms. So the reaction would be 2 Li → 2 Li+ + 2e^−. Then 2 Cl2 + 2e^- → 4 Cl^−. So combining, 2 Li + 2 Cl2 → 2 LiCl + 2 Cl^−? Wait, no, wait: LiCl is Li+Cl^−, so when you mix 2 Li and 2 Cl2, you get 2 LiCl.

Wait, that makes sense. So the balanced reaction is 2 Li + Cl2 → 2 LiCl.

Wait, but wait, the LiCl is a salt solution. So in the cell, the Li metal is in contact with the LiCl solution. So the anode is Li metal, and the cathode is Cl2 gas.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Li weight to Cl2. So what's the molar ratio? Let me think about the molar masses. 

The atomic weight of Li is 6.94 g/mol, and Cl is 35.5 g/mol. So Cl2 is 71 g/mol.

So in the reaction, 2 moles of Li (6.94 *2 = 13.88 g) reacts with 1 mole of Cl2 (35.5 *2=71 g). So the weight of Li per mole of Cl2 is 13.88 grams per 71 grams.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Li weight to Cl2 weight. So that would be (13.88 / 71) = approx 0.196. So looking at the options, B is 0.196.

Wait, but wait. The cell reaction is 2 Li → 2 Li+ + 2 e^− (oxidation), and Cl2 + 2e^- → 2 Cl^- (reduction). So each Li atom loses one electron, and each Cl2 gains two electrons. So the electrons are balanced by 2 Li and 1 Cl2.

So the ratio of moles of Li to Cl2 is 2:1. But the question is about the ratio of their weights. So weight of Li per mole of Cl2 is (2 * 6.94) / (71) = (13.88)/71 ≈ 0.196.

So the ratio is 0.196 per mole of Cl2. So the weight of Li is 0.196 times the weight of Cl2.

Alternatively, if the ratio is Li : Cl2, it's 2:1. So the Li is twice the Cl2 in moles, but in terms of weight, Li is lighter, so the weight of Li per mole of Cl2 is (2* atomic weight Li) / (atomic weight Cl *2) )= (2 *6.94)/(35.5 *2) )= 6.94 /35.5 ≈ 0.196. So the weight of Li is 0.196 times the weight of Cl2.

Wait, but the question is, what is the optimum ratio of Li weight to Cl2? So the weight of Li per gram of Cl2 is 0.196.

So the ratio is 0.196, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The cell reaction: 2 Li + Cl2 → 2 LiCl. So per mole Li, you get 0.5 mol LiCl, and per mole Cl2, 1 mole LiCl. So weight wise, per mole LiCl, it's (6.94 +35.5)/2 ≈ 21.24 g/mol. But that's not directly relevant.

Alternatively, the moles of Li per Cl2 in the cell reaction is 2:1. But when considering mass, the weight of Li is 2*(6.94) = 13.88, Cl2 is 71. So the ratio is 13.88 :71, which is 0.196 approximately.

So the ratio would be 0.196 per Cl2. So the weight of Li is 0.196 times the weight of Cl2. So the ratio of Li to Cl2 is 0.196. So the correct answer is B, 0.196.

To determine the optimum ratio of Li weight to Cl2 in the electrochemical cell, we analyze the reaction:

1. **Cell Reaction**: The reaction involves Li (metal) being oxidized at the anode and Cl2 (gas) being reduced at the cathode. The balanced reaction is:
   \[
   2 \, \text{Li} + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{LiCl}
   \]
   Here, 2 moles of Li react with 1 mole of Cl2 to produce 2 moles of LiCl.

2. **Atomic Weights**:
   - Li has an atomic weight of 6.94 g/mol.
   - Cl has an atomic weight of 35.5 g/mol, so Cl2 has a molar mass of \( 35.5 \times 2 = 71 \, \text{g/mol} \).

3. **Weight Ratio Calculation**:
   - For 2 moles of Li, the total weight is \( 2 \times 6.94 = 13.88 \, \text{g} \).
   - For 1 mole of Cl2, the total weight is \( 71 \, \text{g} \).
   - The ratio of Li weight to Cl2 weight is:
     \[
     \frac{13.88}{71} \approx 0.196
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   The optimum ratio of Li weight to Cl2 is **0.196**, which corresponds to option B.
