Question:

What is the source of the material that causes meteor showers?

Options:

A: Large meteorites disintegrate in the Earth's atmosphere, creating smaller particles that cause a meteor shower.
B: Near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an asteroid we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower.
C: Asteroid impacts elsewhere in the solar system throw sand-sized particles into space and occasionally the Earth passes through a cloud of these particles which burn up in our atmosphere and cause a meteor shower.
D: Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through a cloud of dust and debris left behind by the disintegration of planets in our solar system.
E: The gravitational pull of the moon causes rocks on its surface to be ejected into space. These rocks then enter Earth's atmosphere and cause a meteor shower.
F: Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through the tail of a comet, where dust and ice particles are left behind.
G: Meteor showers are caused by the Earth passing through a cloud of dust and debris left behind by the disintegration of distant stars.
H: Near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere creating hundreds of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a single location in the sky.
I: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of satellites and space debris as they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere.
J: The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital paths. When the Earth passes through the orbit of an comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles that cause a meteor shower.

Okay, so I have this question about meteor showers and their sources. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking what causes the meteor material that causes meteor showers. The options are A through J. I remember that meteor showers are a collection of meteors from various directions, like a shower of lights.

Option A says large meteorites cause disintegration, creating smaller particles. That doesn't sound right because I don't recall meteor showers being caused by meteorites. They're more about the Earth's atmosphere.

Option B mentions near-Earth asteroids disintegrating and spreading. That sounds relevant. I think asteroids in our solar system can cause meteor showers because they might pass through Earth's atmosphere. When they hit, they're broken into smaller pieces, which might be enough to create a shower.

Option C talks about asteroid impacts elsewhere in the solar system throwing particles into space. But I'm not sure if that's the primary source. Also, I thought the primary cause is earth being hit by asteroids, not other planets.

Option D says the Earth passes through dust from planet disintegration. That makes sense too. Because the Earth is a planet, as other planets' debris (like asteroids) pass through, they might leave dust in the way. So when Earth comes through that dust, it gets hit by particles, causing a shower.

Option E is about the moon's gravity ejecting rocks. That sounds more like a solar wind or something from the moon's gravity, but I don't think that's a major source for meteor showers. They’re more likely from Earth itself.

Option F suggests comets. Comets have tails, and their dust can scatter meteors. But I thought the main reason is asteroids, not comets. So F might not be the right choice.

Option G is about distant stars' debris. I don't think that's the primary source because meteor showers are from closer in objects like asteroids and comets.

Option H says near-Earth asteroids disintegrate and create meteors. That sounds familiar. Because as they enter Earth's atmosphere, they break into smaller pieces. Like, when a large asteroid passes through Earth, it's broken into smaller pieces, and those might collide with Earth's surface. So this could create a meteor shower.

Option I is about satellite debris. I'm not sure, but satellites are man-made and are rare, so I don't think they cause meteor showers. They're more about space debris from natural objects.

Option J talks about the nuclei of comets spreading out. I think the primary cause is the movement of comets, not their nuclei. So J isn't correct.

So now, looking back, the two main possibilities are B and H. B says asteroids disintegrate and spread. H says near-Earth asteroids cause them. Wait, wait, no—H says near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere. So H is correct because as the asteroid breaks apart, the smaller pieces go into space and hit Earth, causing a shower.

So the correct answer is H. Because that's the one that directly explains the process.

The correct answer is **H: Meteor showers are caused by the disintegration of near-Earth asteroids as they enter Earth's atmosphere, creating small particles that collide with Earth's surface and cause a meteor shower.**

**Explanation:**  
H correctly identifies that meteor showers result from near-Earth asteroids disintegrating in Earth's atmosphere, breaking them into smaller pieces. These smaller particles, often referred to as meteors, collide with Earth, leading to the observed meteor showers. This process directly explains the source of the meteor particles responsible for the meteor showers.
