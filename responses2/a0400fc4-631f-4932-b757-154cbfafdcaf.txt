Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. The function given is f(x, y) = x² - 2xy + y³. The question is about finding which of the statements A to J is true regarding the relative and absolute extrema of this function. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on multivariable calculus, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that to find extrema for a function of two variables, I need to find the critical points by setting the partial derivatives equal to zero. Critical points are where the gradient is zero or undefined, but since this function f is a polynomial, the derivatives will be defined everywhere, so we only need to set them to zero.

So, let's compute the partial derivatives.

The partial derivative with respect to x, f_x, would be 2x - 2y. Because the derivative of x² is 2x, the derivative of -2xy with respect to x is -2y (since y is treated as a constant when taking the partial derivative with respect to x), and the derivative of y³ with respect to x is zero.

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y, f_y, is -2x + 3y². The derivative of x² is zero, derivative of -2xy is -2x, and derivative of y³ is 3y².

So, setting f_x = 0 and f_y = 0, we get the system of equations:

1) 2x - 2y = 0 --> x = y
2) -2x + 3y² = 0

Wait, from equation 1, x = y. So substitute x for y in equation 2.

Equation 2 becomes: -2x + 3x² = 0.

Factor that: x(-2 + 3x) = 0.

So, either x = 0 or -2 + 3x = 0. Solving -2 +3x=0: 3x=2 --> x=2/3.

So, the critical points are at (x=0, y=0) and (x=2/3, y=2/3).

So that gives us two critical points: (0,0) and (2/3, 2/3).

Now, the next step is to determine whether each critical point is a relative minimum, maximum, or a saddle point. We can do this using the second derivative test.

The second derivative test for functions of two variables involves computing the Hessian matrix. The Hessian matrix H is:

[ f_xx  f_xy ]
[ f_xy  f_yy ]

Where f_xx is the second partial derivative with respect to x twice, f_xy is the mixed partial derivative, and f_yy is the second partial derivative with respect to y twice.

Compute these:

f_xx = derivative of f_x with respect to x. Since f_x = 2x - 2y, the derivative is 2.

f_yy = derivative of f_y with respect to y. Since f_y = -2x +3y², derivative is 6y.

f_xy = derivative of f_x with respect to y. f_x is 2x -2y, so derivative is -2.

So the Hessian at any point (x, y) is:

[ 2       -2 ]
[ -2    6y ]

The determinant of the Hessian is (2)(6y) - (-2)(-2) = 12y -4.

The second derivative test says:

- If determinant >0 and f_xx >0: local min.
- If determinant >0 and f_xx <0: local max.
- If determinant <0: saddle point.
- If determinant =0: test is inconclusive.

Let's apply this to each critical point.

First, (0,0):

Compute the determinant: 12*0 -4 = -4.

Since determinant is negative, the test is inconclusive. Hmm, that complicates things. So we can't determine if it's a maximum or minimum just from the determinant. We might need to examine the function values or use another method.

Alternatively, maybe we can look at the function along the line y=0 and y=x to see the behavior.

Wait, but another approach is to use the second derivative and maybe the function's value at these points.

Wait, at (0,0), let's compute f(0,0): 0 - 0 + 0 = 0.

At (2/3, 2/3): f(2/3, 2/3) = (2/3)^2 - 2*(2/3)*(2/3) + (2/3)^3.

Calculate each term:

(2/3)^2 = 4/9.

2*(2/3)*(2/3) = 8/9.

(2/3)^3 = 8/27.

So f = 4/9 - 8/9 + 8/27.

Compute 4/9 is 12/27, 8/9 is 24/27, 8/27 is 8/27.

Wait, 4/9 = (4 * 3)/(27) = 12/27.

8/9 = (8 *3)/(27) = 24/27.

So 12/27 -24/27 +8/27 = (12-24+8)/27= (-4)/27.

So f(2/3,2/3) is -4/27, which is negative.

Hmm, but wait, when I thought the determinant for (0,0) is -4, which is negative, so it's a saddle point.

So (0,0) is a saddle point.

So the function has relative extrema at (2/3, 2/3) only, and that's a relative maximum or minimum? Wait, since the determinant at (2/3,2/3) is 12*(2/3) -4 = 8 -4=4>0. And f_xx=2>0. So it's a local minimum.

So (2/3,2/3) is a local minimum.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should double-check the determinant. Let's recalculate the Hessian at (2/3,2/3):

f_xx=2, f_xy=-2, f_yy=6y=6*(2/3)=4.

So Hessian determinant is (2)(4) - (-2)^2 =8 -4=4>0.

And f_xx=2>0. So yes, it's a local minimum.

So, the first critical point (0,0) is a saddle point, and the second critical point (2/3,2/3) is a local minimum.

So now, the statements to evaluate:

A: f has all of its relative extrema on y=x². Well, the relative extrema are at (2/3,2/3), which is on the line x=y. So statement A is saying that all relative extrema are on y=x². But (2/3,2/3) is on x=y, which is a line, not x=y². So A is false.

B: f has all of its relative extrema on x=y. Well, only (2/3, 2/3) is a relative extremum, and that's on x=y. So statement B is true.

C: f has all relative extrema on x=2y. (2/3,2/3) is on x=y, which is not x=2y. 2y for (2/3) is 4/3, but x is 2/3, so no. So statement C is false.

D: f has a relative maximum at (0,0). But we found that (0,0) is a saddle point, so this is false.

E: f has an absolute maximum at (2/3,2/3). The function at that point is -4/27, which is negative. If the function's maximum is at that point, but whether it's the absolute maximum depends on the behavior of the function elsewhere. Since f approaches infinity as x or y increases, I don't think (2/3,2/3) is an absolute maximum. So E is false.

F: f has an absolute minimum at (0,0). Wait, f(0,0) is 0. But (2/3,2/3) is a local minimum at -4/27, which is less than f(0,0). So (0,0) is a local maximum, not the absolute minimum. So F is false.

G: f has an absolute minimum at (2/3,2/3). Wait, that's a local minimum, but is it the absolute? Well, function values elsewhere: as x and y approach infinity, x² dominates, so f tends to infinity. But for negative values, y³ can be negative. For example, if x is large negative, but let's see, perhaps the function can attain lower values elsewhere.

Wait, let's consider when x is negative. Suppose x is some large negative number, say x = -M (M>0). Let's see f(x,y) = x² -2xy + y³. If x is negative, then -2xy would be positive if y is positive. So if x is large and negative, then x² is positive and large. So f would be positive plus something else. But maybe for y positive, but specific values, the function could dip lower.

Wait, but let's think about whether (2/3,2/3) is the absolute min. Since f at that point is -4/27, which is about -0.148. If the function can take lower values, like more negative than -4/27, then it's not the absolute minimum. For example, what's f(1,1)? Let's compute.

f(1,1) = 1 - 2*1*1 +1 = 1-2+1=0. So that's 0.

What about f(-1, -1): (-1)^2 -2*(-1)(-1) + (-1)^3 = 1 - 2*(1) + (-1) = 1-2-1= -2. So f(-1,-1) is -2, which is lower than -4/27. So definitely, the function has an absolute minimum somewhere else, perhaps at (some point). So statement G is false.

H: f has a relative minimum at (0,0). As previously determined, (0,0) is a saddle point, not a minima. So H is false.

I: f has a relative minimum at (2/3,2/3). Which we've established is a local minima, yes. So I is true.

J: f has all relative extrema on the parabola x=y². Let's see, the relative extrema are at (2/3,2/3), which lies on x=y, but not x=y². Because y² is 4/9, and x=2/3 which is less than 4/9. So (2/3, 2/3) is not on x=y². So statement J is false.

So, which statements are true?

B: correct.

I: correct.

Wait, let me double-check each statement.

Looking back at the options:

A: All relative extrema on y=x². Since (2/3,2/3) is on y=x, but not on y=x². So A is false.

B: All relative extrema on x=y. The only relative extrema is at (2/3,2/3), which is on x=y. So B is correct.

C: All relative extrema on x=2y. (2/3,2/3) is not on x=2y because 2y is 4/3, which is not equal to 2/3. So C is false.

D: Relative max at (0,0). Wrong; it's a saddle point.

E: Absolute max at (2/3,2/3). Wrong; it's a local min, and the function tends to infinity elsewhere.

F: Absolute min at (0,0). Wrong, because the function has lower values elsewhere.

G: Absolute min at (2/3,2/3). Wrong, because function can go lower, as shown earlier.

H: Relative min at (0,0). Wrong.

I: Relative min at (2/3,2/3). Correct.

J: All relative extrema on x=y². Wrong, (2/3,2/3) is not on x=y² (since x=2/3, y=2/3, x=y² would imply 2/3 = (2/3)^2 =4/9, which is not true).

So the correct options are B and I.

To determine which statements about the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^3 \) are true, we first find the critical points by setting the partial derivatives to zero.

### Step 1: Compute Partial Derivatives
The first partial derivatives are:
\[
f_x = 2x - 2y, \quad f_y = -2x + 3y^2.
\]
Setting these equal to zero gives the system:
\[
1) \quad 2x - 2y = 0 \implies x = y.
\]
\[
2) \quad -2x + 3y^2 = 0.
\]
Substituting \( x = y \) into the second equation:
\[
-2y + 3y^2 = 0 \implies y(-2 + 3y) = 0.
\]
Thus, \( y = 0 \) or \( y = \frac{2}{3} \). Correspondingly, \( x = 0 \) or \( x = \frac{2}{3} \).

The critical points are:
1. \( (0, 0) \)
2. \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \)

### Step 2: Second Derivative Test
The second partial derivatives are:
\[
f_{xx} = 2, \quad f_{yy} = 6y, \quad f_{xy} = -2.
\]
The Hessian matrix is:
\[
H = \begin{bmatrix}
f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
f_{xy} & f_{yy}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -2 \\
-2 & 6y
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The determinant of the Hessian is:
\[
\text{det}(H) = (2)(6y) - (-2)^2 = 12y - 4.
\]

#### At \( (0, 0) \):
\[
\text{det}(H) = 12(0) - 4 = -4 < 0.
\]
Since the determinant is negative, \( (0, 0) \) is a saddle point.

#### At \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \):
\[
\text{det}(H) = 12\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4 > 0.
\]
\[
f_{xx} = 2 > 0.
\]
Since \( \text{det}(H) > 0 \) and \( f_{xx} > 0 \), \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \) is a local minimum.

### Step 3: Evaluate Statements
- **A**: "f has all of its relative extrema on the line \( y = x^2 \)."  
  The only relative extremum is at \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \), which lies on \( x = y \), not \( x = y^2 \). Hence, **A is false**.

- **B**: "f has all of its relative extrema on the line \( x = y \)."  
  The only relative extremum is at \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \), which lies on \( x = y \). Hence, **B is true**.

- **C**: "f has all of its relative extrema on the line \( x = 2y \)."  
  The only relative extremum is at \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \), which does not lie on \( x = 2y \). Hence, **C is false**.

- **D**: "f has a relative maximum at \( (0, 0) \)."  
  \( (0, 0) \) is a saddle point, not a local maximum. Hence, **D is false**.

- **E**: "f has an absolute maximum at \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \)."  
  The function tends to infinity as \( x \) or \( y \) increases, so \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \) is not an absolute maximum. Hence, **E is false**.

- **F**: "f has an absolute minimum at \( (0, 0) \)."  
  \( (0, 0) \) is a saddle point, not a local minimum. Hence, **F is false**.

- **G**: "f has an absolute minimum at \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \)."  
  The function can take lower values elsewhere, so this is not true. Hence, **G is false**.

- **H**: "f has a relative minimum at \( (0, 0) \)."  
  \( (0, 0) \) is a saddle point, not a local minimum. Hence, **H is false**.

- **I**: "f has a relative minimum at \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \)."  
  \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \) is a local minimum. Hence, **I is true**.

- **J**: "f has all of its relative extrema on the parabola \( x = y^2 \)."  
  \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \) does not lie on \( x = y^2 \). Hence, **J is false**.

### Final Answer:
The true statements are **B** and **I**.
