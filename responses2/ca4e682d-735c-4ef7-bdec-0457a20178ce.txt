Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about Marguerite's test scores. Let me try to break it down. 

The question says Marguerite earned a score between 75 and 89 on all her previous spelling tests. Then she got a 100 on her next test. I need to figure out which statement about her scores is true. The options are A to H, each talking about different statistical measures—like median, mode, mean, or range.

First, let's recap what each term means. The median is the middle value when all the numbers are arranged in order. The mode is the most frequent number. The mean is the average, calculated by summing all scores and dividing by the number of tests. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores.

So, Marguerite's previous tests are all between 75 and 89. Let's say she took N tests before the 100. Now she has N+1 tests.

Let me think about how adding a 100 affects each measure.

Starting with the mean. The mean is the average. Since all previous scores are between 75 and 89, the current mean is probably somewhere in that range as well. Adding a 100, which is higher than the previous maximum of 89, would increase the total sum. The number of tests increases by one, so the mean would increase. For example, suppose she had three tests: 85, 85, 85. The mean is 85. Adding a 100 gives a total of 270 /4 = 67.5. Wait, no, that can't be right. Oh, wait, no, 85*3 is 255 plus 100 is 355. Divided by 4 is 88.75. So the mean goes up from 85 to 88.75. So yes, the mean will increase. So option D says the mean will increase, which seems correct.

But wait, let me check other options too. Let's see.

Option E says the range will decrease. The range is max - min. All previous scores are 75-89. The new score is 100, so the new max is 100, and the new min is still 75 (assuming all previous tests are at least 75). So range was 89-75=14. Now it's 100-75=25. So the range increases. So E is false.

Option F: Mean will decrease. No, because adding a higher score would raise the mean. So F is wrong.

Option G says mode will increase. The mode is the most frequent. If all previous scores were unique, but after adding 100, if 100 occurred once, it's still the mode. So if before 100, each score appeared once, then mode is all the same. Adding 100 once, it's still mode. So mode doesn't change. So G is wrong.

Option H says mode will increase. So H is not true if the mode didn't change.

Option A: The median will decrease. The median is the middle value. Let's say she had 2 previous tests (so N=2, previous tests 75,89). Now N+1=3. The previous scores were, say, 75, 85, 89. The median was 85. After adding 100, the new list is 75,85,89,100. The median is 85. So the median didn't change. So the median remains the same. So A is wrong.

Option B: Mode will decrease. No, the mode is still the most frequent. If all were unique except for 100, but if 100 is added once, the mode would still be the same. So B is wrong.

Option C: The median will remain the same. In the example, the median was 85 and remains 85. So C is correct in that case. But wait, what if the previous scores had a mode? Like say, previous tests were 85,85,85. Then the median was 85. Adding 100, the new list is 85,85,85,100. The median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd, which is (85+85)/2 =85. So the median remains same. So C is correct in this case. But does it always happen?

Wait, the question says all previous scores were between 75 and 89. But it's possible that some scores are the same as 100. But 100 is higher than 89, so no. So all previous scores are <=89, and adding 100, which is higher than any previous. So the new score is higher than any previous, so it's a new maximum.

Wait, but what about the previous scores? For example, if all previous tests were 89, then the previous median was 89. Adding a 100: the new list would have 89 appearing N times, and 100 once. The median would be the middle one, which is 89. So the median remains same. So in that case, the median doesn't change.

So in general, adding a score higher than all before, the new score is the maximum, so the median will be the middle value. Since the previous median was <=89, the new median is either the same as before or perhaps higher. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's take another example. Suppose she had 1 test: 89. Then adding 100. Now the scores are 89 and 100. The median is (89+100)/2=94.5, which is higher than before (89). So the median increases. So in that case, the median increases.

Wait, but in a previous example, when all previous were 85, adding 100: new median was 85. So the median stayed the same. So the median may or may not change. Therefore, statement C is not always true.

So, for some cases, the median remains same, others increase. So C is not necessarily true.

So the correct statements would be D and H, but let's see.

Wait, before, I thought that adding a higher score would increase the mean but what about the median? In the case where the previous median was 89, adding 100 makes the new median (89 and 100)/2=94.5. So the median increases.

Wait, but if the previous median was lower, say 85, adding 100, the new list has 3 elements:85,85,100. The median is 85. So it's same.

So in some cases, the median remains same, in others it increases. So statement C is not necessarily true.

So looking back at the options, the possible correct statements are D (mean increases) and H (mode increases). But wait, can the mode increase?

If all previous scores were unique, adding a new score that is unique would not change the mode. So mode remains same. But if one of the previous scores was same as 100, but that's impossible because 100 is higher than 89.

Wait, no, 100 is higher than 89. So all previous scores are <=89, so adding 100, which is higher than any previous. So the new score is higher than any previous, hence it's a new maximum.

So the previous mode was probably not 100, as all previous tests were between 75-89. So the mode depends on what was the prior distribution.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether the previous test scores were all unique or had a mode. So perhaps we can't say for sure.

But for the options, let's see which are correct.

D: mean will increase. This is correct, as adding a higher score increases the average.

H: mode will increase. The mode was perhaps the highest score. If 100 was not the highest, but wait, 100 was higher than previous. So the mode is now 100, but if all previous scores were unique, then 100 would become the new mode. So if before, all previous scores were unique, mode is none or not applicable, but after adding 100, if it's unique, the mode becomes 100. So in that case, the mode increases.

Wait, but the question says that in all previous tests, the score was between 75 and 89. So 100 is outside that range. So if in the previous tests, the mode was, say, 89, then adding 100 would make 100 the new mode, as it's the only new score. So the mode would increase.

But if in the previous tests, the mode was 75, then adding 100 wouldn't change the mode unless another 75 was added. But the problem doesn't say anything about the frequency of previous scores. So we can't be certain about the mode.

Wait, but the question is about which statements are true. So H says the mode will increase. Whether that's the case depends on the previous data.

But the question doesn't provide specific information about the previous scores. So perhaps H is not necessarily true. For example, if all previous scores were 85, then adding 100 would make the mode increase from none (if no previous 100) to 100. So the mode increases. But if the previous scores had a mode at 85, adding 100 would still have mode at 85, because 100 isn't a previous score. So, in that case, the mode would remain the same, not increase.

So the statement H is not always true. Therefore, we can't conclude that the mode will always increase.

So the only statement that is always true is D: the mean will increase.

Wait, but earlier when I considered a case where previous median was 85 and 100 was added, the median was same. So the median could stay same or increase. So C is not always true.

So the correct statements are D and H? Or is D the only correct one?

Wait, the question asks which of the statements is true. So multiple could be correct? But the options are A to H, each a separate statement.

So looking back, the options are individual statements. So the correct statement is D. Because the mean will definitely increase. The other options may or may not be correct, but since the question is a multiple-choice, and only one option is correct, D is the correct statement.

So the correct answer is D: The mean will increase.
</think>

The correct answer is D: The mean will increase. 

**Explanation:**
- **Mean:** Adding a higher score (100) than all previous scores (75–89) will increase the average. For example, if previous scores were 75, 85, 89 (mean 85.33), adding 100 increases the sum to 359 over 4 tests, giving a mean of 89.75, which is higher.
- **Other options:** 
  - **B, C, F, G, H:** These options can vary depending on the distribution of previous scores. The median may or may not remain the same, the mode could change or not, and the range increases.
- Only **D** is always true.
