Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about cat food brands and their claims. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question is asking which brand is so popular that cats ask for it by name. The options are A through J. I'll need to recall which brands are known for their high-quality, loved-for cats.

First, I'll list out the brands and think about what each is known for. Purina One rings a bell as a well-known brand. Hill's Science Diet is another brand I've heard about a lot. 9-Lives is a well-known brand, maybe for its taste. Cat Chow, I'm not as sure about. Iams is another one I've heard of, perhaps for its high-quality ingredients.

Royal Canin is another big name, I think. Meow Mix is also popular, maybe for its high-quality ingredients. Blue Buffalo comes to mind too, I believe. Whiskas is another brand I've heard of, perhaps for its high-quality ingredients too.

Wait, the question is looking for a brand that cat owners ask for by name. I remember that Hill's Science Diet is known for its high-quality ingredients, especially for dogs, but maybe specifically for cats. Also, Hill's is famous for being a good source of protein, which cats need. 

Wait another thought: I remember that Hill's is often cited for its high-quality ingredients, which can make the cats happy. So maybe they are the right answer. 

Looking back at the options: Hill's Science Diet is option B. The question is about the brand that's so tasty that cats ask for it by name. Hill's is a brand that's been praised for its high-quality ingredients and is a favorite among cat owners. So the answer should be B.
