Okay, so Iâ€™ve got this question about treaties and whether they bind non-State parties, which are referred to as third states. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that treaties are agreements signed by countries, and they usually involve the consent of both the signatory countries. But sometimes, this might not be the case. The question is about whether treaties bind third states without their consent.

I think about the concept of bindingness of treaties. Treaties are generally considered to be acts of international law, and they are not automatically binding on all parties. For example, they must be signed by both the states involved. But what about third parties?

Wait, I recall that some treaties might have provisions that apply to non-state actors. But I'm not entirely sure. Do treaties create obligations or rights for third states without their consent?

Let me look at the options. Option A says treaties do no create obligations or rights for third states without consent. That sounds familiar. I think that's the case. Treaties are usually created with the consent of the signatory states, but third parties might have their own obligations or rights based on the treaty.

Option B says treaties create both obligations and rights for third states. I'm not sure if that's correct. I think some states might have obligations, but third states might not have rights unless the treaty specifically gives them. Not sure, but I think A might be correct.

Option C: Treaties don't create rights even when consent comes in. That doesn't sound right because I think the consent is necessary for some extensions, but maybe not for all rights.

Option D: Treaties create only obligations for third states. I'm not sure. I think the obligation might come from the signatory states, but for the third states, maybe the treaty creates rights instead.

Option E: Treaties create obligations without consent. No, because they have to consent.

Option F: Treaties create only rights. I don't think so; the obligation is more likely from the signatories.

Option G: No obligations or rights. That doesn't make sense because some states would have obligations.

Option H: Treaties create rights without consent. Also incorrect, since the consent is necessary for obligations from the signatories, but maybe for some rights from the third states.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Treaties are generally formed with the consent of both signatories. But do they have any obligations or rights for non-signatory countries? I think they might create obligations for the signatory countries, but not necessarily for third states.

But the question is about whether they bind third states. So, do they create obligations or rights for third states without consent? I think they don't create any rights or obligations for third states. Because the consent is only for the signatory states, not for non-signatory ones. So the correct answer would be option G: Treaties do not create any rights or obligations for third States, even when consent comes in.

Wait, but option A says no obligations or rights. So option A would be correct. Let me check again. The question is about whether the treaties bind third states. For example, if a treaty is signed by two states A and B, and a third state C wants to do something, can C benefit without A and B's consent?

I think the answer is no. The consent is needed for obligations from A and B, but not necessarily for rights from C. So the correct option is A: Treaties do no create obligations or rights for third States without their consent.

So the answer should be A.
