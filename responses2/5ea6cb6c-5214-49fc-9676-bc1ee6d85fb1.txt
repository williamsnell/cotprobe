Okay, let's try to figure out how much Maria spends on lunch during a 5-day work week. So, the question says she spends $9 each day. I need to multiply 5 days by $9 per day to find the total. Hmm, 5 times 9. Let me think, 5 multiplied by 9 is 45. So, $45 would be the total for 5 days. Looking at the options, option G is $45. That must be the right answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The multiplication is straightforward.

To find the total amount Maria spends on lunch during a 5-day work week, multiply the daily expense by the number of days:

\[
\text{Total} = 5 \times \$9 = \$45
\]

**Option G: \$45**

Answer: G
