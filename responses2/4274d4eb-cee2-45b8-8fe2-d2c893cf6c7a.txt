Okay, so I have this question about comparing older adults' memory for recent events versus those that happened a long time ago. The question is about a problem in this comparison, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that memory fade effects are a big topic. fade means that old memories fade over time, right? So when you try to remember something that's been a while, it's harder because all the recent memories interfere with it. 

The question is saying that comparing older adults' memories of recent events with those of events that happened a long time ago has a problem. So the issue is why older adults can't remember recent events as well as younger ones can. 

Looking at the options, option A says recent events can be verified while older ones can't. Wait, isn't that the opposite? I thought that older events can be more difficult because they're harder to verify. So A might not be correct because older events can't be verified, not the other way around.

Option B says they're influenced by current mental state. Yeah, that makes sense. If someone's current state affects their memory, they might forget recent events. Like, if they're stressed or anxious, they might forget recent news. So B sounds like a valid issue.

Option C: May be very well rehearsed. Wait, if something is well rehearsed, it means it's been memorized before and is easy to recall. So if recent events were already well rehearsed, older adults might not need to verify them as much. But the question is about the problem in comparing, so I'm not sure if C is the main issue here.

Option D: Are more likely to be distorted or embellished. I thought distortions happen when people think something's different from it is, but I'm not sure if that's a problem in comparing old and new events. Maybe it's used in another context, like when someone tries to make a story fit their memory rather than just remembering the facts. Wait, but I'm not certain about this one.

Option E: Are often less significant than older events. That's the opposite of what I remember. I thought older events are usually more significant because they influence our current state more. So E doesn't fit.

Option F: Have a different emotional impact. Hmm, I'm not sure. I know that recent events might evoke more emotions because they're more immediate, but older events don't necessarily do the same. However, I'm not sure if this is a direct comparison issue or more about the nature of the events themselves.

Option G: Have no denominator to help in computing an average. That doesn't seem relevant to the question about memory.

Option H: Can be easily confused with older events. Oh, that's interesting. Because older events might be more familiar or have similar patterns, confusing them with recent ones could happen. So H is a valid point.

Option I: Are more likely to be forgotten. Yes, that's a classic issue. Recent events are harder to remember because they're more recent and thus more likely to be forgotten. So I is correct.

Option J: Are far more meaningful. That's the opposite of what the question is asking. The question is about the problem in comparing, not the result of the comparison.

So, back to the options. The question is about the problem in comparing. So the correct issues would be about difficulty in remembering recent events because they're harder to verify, influenced by current mental state, or perhaps confusing with older events.

Wait, looking again. The options are:

A: Can be verified while older events often cannot.

Wait, that says older events can't be verified, which I think is the opposite of what I remember. Because recent events are easier to verify, not harder. So A is incorrect because it's the opposite of the idea.

B: Are influenced by current mental state.

That's correct. Because if someone is fatigued or stressed, they might forget recent news, making older events seem more difficult to remember.

C: May be very well rehearsed.

Well, if recent events are well rehearsed, they can be remembered easily. So if someone can't remember recent events, it's because they're not well rehearsed, but this option is about being well rehearsed. So if recent events were already well rehearsed, this would be a problem. But I'm not sure if this is the main issue the question is pointing out.

D: Are more likely to be distorted or embellished.

I'm not sure about this. I think distortions are when people think something is different when it's not. Maybe this applies more when trying to reconstruct a narrative, but not sure.

E: Are often less significant than older events.

No, I think older events are more significant. So E is incorrect.

F: Have a different emotional impact.

I'm not sure about this. Recent events can have strong emotional impacts, but older events might not be as emotionally charged. So maybe this isn't a problem in comparison but more about the nature of the events.

G: No denominator for computing an average. Not relevant.

H: Can be easily confused with older events.

Yes, this is a valid point. Because older events might be more familiar or similar, leading to confusion.

I: Are more likely to be forgotten.

Yes, this is a well-known issue. Recent events are harder to remember because they're more recent, so H and I are both correct. Wait, but the question is about the problem in comparing, so which one is more directly the issue.

Wait, the options are A to I. The question is, which is the problem in comparing older adults' memory for recent events with older events. So the correct answer should be about why recent events are harder to remember.

So B is about being influenced by current mental state, which is correct because mental state can affect memory.

H is also correct because recent events are more likely to be forgotten.

But the question is about the problem in comparing. So I'm thinking that the issue is that recent events can't be verified, so the problem is that you can't verify recent events as easily as older ones. So the correct answer would be A's opposite.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine. The question is, what is the problem in comparing.

The problem is that older adults can't remember recent events as well because they're harder to verify. So the issue is that recent events are harder to remember, making comparison difficult.

So the correct answer would be the issue that recent events are harder to remember. So which options relate to that.

A says older events can't be verified. So this is the opposite of what's happening, so A is incorrect.

B says influenced by current mental state. That's correct, as mental state affects recall.

H says recent events are more likely to be forgotten. That's correct.

I think the options are about the issue in comparing, so which one is the main problem.

Wait, the question says, "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

So the correct answer's last letter must be the chosen letter.

Looking back at the options:

Let me rephrase the options:

A: Can be verified while older events often cannot. → Incorrect because older events are harder to verify.

B: Are influenced by current mental state. → Correct.

C: May be very well rehearsed. → I'm not sure, but this is about ease of recall.

D: Are more likely to be distorted or embellished. → Not sure.

E: Are often less significant than older events. → Incorrect.

F: Have a different emotional impact. → Not sure.

G: Have no denominator to help in computing an average. → Irrelevant.

H: Can be easily confused with older events. → Correct.

I: Are more likely to be forgotten. → Correct.

J: Are far more meaningful. → Incorrect.

So the options that are correct are B, H, and I.

But the question is about comparing older adults' memory for recent events with older events. So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember because they're more recent and thus more likely to be forgotten.

So the correct answer would be A's opposite, but in the options, which one is the issue.

Wait, the options are about the problem in comparison. So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember, making it difficult to compare.

So the correct answer is the issue that recent events are harder to remember.

So the options that address that are B (mental state), H (being forgotten), and I (confusion).

But the question is about the problem in comparing, which likely refers to the difficulty in remembering recent events, hence the issue is that recent events are harder to remember.

So the correct answer is either B, H, or I.

But looking back at the options, the question asks which option is the problem in comparing.

So the correct answer is B, H, or I. But I need to pick the best fit.

Wait, the question is about why older adults can't remember recent events as well as older ones. So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember because of their recent age.

So the options that address this are B, H, and I.

But the question is about the problem in comparing, so which one is the main issue. The problem is that recent events are harder to remember, making it difficult to compare.

So the options that address this are options B, H, and I.

But the question is asking which option is the problem. So the correct answer is B, H, or I.

Wait, looking at the options again: the correct answer is which of the following is a problem in comparing. So the options that are correct are B, H, and I.

But the problem is that recent events are harder to remember. So the issue is that older adults find it hard to remember recent events, perhaps due to being more recent and thus more likely to be forgotten.

So the correct answer would be B, H, or I.

Wait, but the options are about what is the problem. So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember, making comparison difficult. So the correct answer is about the difficulty in remembering recent events, which is addressed by B, H, and I.

But the options are the choices, and the correct answer must be one of them. So the question is to select which is the problem, so the correct answer is B, H, or I.

Wait, but the options are:

A: Older events cannot be verified → incorrect.

B: Influenced by mental state → correct.

H: Forgotten → correct.

I: More likely to be forgotten → correct.

So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember because they're more recent and thus more likely to be forgotten.

So the correct answer is B, H, or I.

Wait, but the question is about the problem in comparing, so the correct answer is that recent events are harder to remember. So the correct option is B, H, or I.

Wait, but the options are: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J.

The options are the possible answers, and I need to choose one.

So, the problem is that recent events are harder to remember, making it difficult to compare. So the correct answer is B: Are influenced by current mental state. H: Are more likely to be forgotten. I: Are more likely to be forgotten.

So which one is correct.

Wait, the question is not about why recent events are harder to remember, but the problem in comparing. So perhaps the correct answer is H, because recent events are more likely to be forgotten. Or B, because mental state affects memory.

But the correct answer would be the one that addresses the issue of difficulty in remembering recent events.

So the options are:

B: Influenced by current mental state.

H: Are more likely to be forgotten.

I: Are more likely to be forgotten.

So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember, so the correct answers are B, H, and I.

But the question is about the problem in comparing, which is about why recent events are harder to remember. So the correct answer would be the issue that recent events are harder to remember, which is addressed by B, H, and I.

But the options are given as single letters. So the answer must be one of them.

Looking at the options, perhaps B is the best answer because it directly relates to how recent events are influenced by mental state, which affects their recall. H and I are both about the difficulty of remembering recent events, but I think B is more about the mental state influencing their memory.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that recent events are harder to remember because they're more recent, making it harder to verify. So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember because they're more recent.

So the correct answer would be A's opposite (the issue is that recent events are harder to remember).

But the options are about the problem in comparing. So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember, making comparison difficult. So the correct answer is B, H, or I.

Wait, but the question is asking which of the options is the problem in the comparison. So the correct answer is the one that's a reason why recent events are harder to remember.

Looking for the correct answer, perhaps the best fit is option A: Because older events can't be verified, making comparison difficult. But wait, option A is the opposite. Because older events can't be verified, which is not the issue. So A is incorrect.

Another approach: Looking at the options, the correct answer is B, which is about being influenced by mental state. Wait, no, because mental state affects their ability to remember, not the difficulty.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B because it's about the mental state affecting their memory, making recent events harder to remember.

Alternatively, the problem is that recent events are harder to remember, making comparison difficult. So the correct answer is B.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is B: Are influenced by current mental state.

Wait, but another thought: recent events are harder to remember because they're more recent, so recent events are more likely to be forgotten. So I is correct.

So the problem is that recent events are harder to remember. So the correct answer is B, H, or I.

But the question is about the problem in comparing, so perhaps the best answer is B.

Wait, no. The question is phrased as "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen."

So, for example, if I choose B, the last character is B. If I choose I, it's I, etc.

In any case, the options I'm considering are B, H, and I. But the issue is that recent events are harder to remember because they're more recent. So the correct answer is B, H, or I.

But looking at the options, the problem is that recent events are harder to remember. So the correct answer is B: influenced by current mental state.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the correct answer is B because it's about how recent events are influenced by mental state, making them harder to remember.

Alternatively, the problem is that recent events are harder to remember, making it difficult to compare. So the correct answer is I.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: Are influenced by current mental state.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: The correct answer is B because when people are fatigued or have low mental state, they're more likely to forget recent events, making it harder to remember them.

So I think the correct answer is B.
</think>

The question asks about the problem in comparing older adults' memory for recent events versus those that happened a long time ago. The correct issue is that recent events are harder to remember because they are more recent and thus more likely to be forgotten. This makes comparison difficult. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Older events can be verified, not the other way around.
- **B**: Correct. Recent events are influenced by current mental state, which affects their recall.
- **C**: Incorrect. It's about being well rehearsed, not the issue of forgetting.
- **D**: Incorrect. Distortion or embellishment is more about reconstruction, not memory difficulty.
- **E**: Incorrect. Older events are more significant than recent ones.
- **F**: Incorrect. Emotional impact is unrelated to memory difficulty.
- **G**: Incorrect. No denominator helps in computing averages doesn't apply here.
- **H**: Correct. Recent events are more likely to be forgotten.
- **I**: Correct. Recent events are harder to remember.
- **J**: Incorrect. Far more meaningful isn't the issue.

The problem is that recent events are harder to remember, making comparison difficult. Both **H** and **I** address this issue, but the question is about the problem in comparison, so the best fit is **H**, as it directly refers to the difficulty of forgetting recent events.
