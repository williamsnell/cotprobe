Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many push-ups Michelle did in January. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The question says that there are 31 days in January, and Michelle did 45 push-ups each day. The expression given is 31 multiplied by 45, which is 31 × 45. The options are labeled A through J, each with a different number of push-ups. My task is to determine which option is correct.

Hmm, I think I can approach this in a couple of ways. One way is to just calculate 31 multiplied by 45 directly. Alternatively, maybe I can break it down into smaller parts to make it easier. Let me try both methods to make sure I get the right answer.

First, let's do the straightforward multiplication. 31 times 45. I can break 45 into 40 and 5, so 31 × 40 and 31 × 5, then add them together.

31 × 40: Well, 30 × 40 is 1200, and 1 × 40 is 40, so 1200 + 40 = 1240.

Then 31 × 5: That's 155.

Now add those two results together: 1240 + 155. Let's see, 1240 + 100 is 1340, and then +55 is 1395. So 31 × 45 equals 1395 push-ups.

Let me check if that's one of the options. Looking at the options, I see option C is 1,395 push-ups. So that's the one I'm looking for.

Wait, but I remember that sometimes when multiplying two numbers, you can also add them in a different way. Let me try another method to confirm. Maybe using the distributive property differently.

Alternatively, I can think of 45 as 50 - 5. So 31 × 45 = 31 × (50 - 5) = (31 × 50) - (31 × 5).

31 × 50 is 1550, and 31 ×5 is 155. Subtracting, 1550 - 155 is 1395. Yep, same result. So that confirms it.

Wait, another way to check: 45 × 30 is 1350, because 45 × 3 is 135, so ×10 is 1350. Then 45 ×1 is 45. Adding 1350 + 45 gives 1395. So that's consistent too.

So I'm pretty confident now that the answer is 1,395 push-ups, which is option C.

Let me quickly glance at the other options to make sure none of them match. Options A is 1500, which is way higher than 1395. B is 1450, which is also higher. Options D, E, F, G, H, I, J are all lower than 1395 except for option E, which is 1350, and that's close but not correct. So yeah, C is definitely the right answer.

The number of push-ups Michelle did in January is calculated by multiplying the number of days (31) by the daily push-ups (45). 

31 × 45 = 1395.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.

Answer: C: 1,395 push-ups.
