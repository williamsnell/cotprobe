Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the work done by a cable lifting coal. Hmm. I remember that work is force times distance, but since the force isn't constant—because the cable is being extended as you lift—the force changes. So I think I need to model this with a Riemann sum and then turn it into an integral.

Alright, let me break it down. The cable weighs 2 lb per foot. So for every foot you lift, the weight of the cable changes. Wait, no, actually, as you lift the coal, you're lifting the cable as well. But since the coal is 800 lb, that's a constant weight. So maybe the cable's weight is being lifted along with the coal? Or is it that the cable's weight is being pulled up as you lift the coal?

Wait, the problem says a cable is used to lift the coal. So when you lift the coal, you also have to lift the cable. But wait, no, the cable is part of the system. So the total weight being lifted is the weight of both the coal and the cable. But wait, the cable's weight is 2 lb/ft, so when you lift the shaft, you have to consider both the coal and the cable. But that might complicate things because the cable isn't being lifted in addition to the coal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is about lifting 800 lb of coal up a mine shaft that's 500 ft deep. The cable weighs 2 lb per foot. So when you lift the coal, you also have to lift the cable up to that point. So the cable is initially at the bottom, and as you lift the coal, you're adding more cable to the total weight. So the total weight being lifted at any height x is the weight of the coal plus the weight of the cable up to that height.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the cable is 500 ft deep, so when you lift the coal to a height x, you have to lift the entire 500 ft of cable, but only up to x. So the cable's weight is being lifted as you go up. But wait, no, the cable is a fixed weight. So for the entire lift, the cable's weight is 2 lb/ft * 500 ft = 1000 lb. But as you lift the coal, you also have to carry the cable. So the total force at any point x is the weight of the coal (800 lb) plus the weight of the cable that's being lifted up to x. But wait, no—when you lift up 800 lb of coal, you're also lifting the cable, which is 500 ft. So the total weight you're lifting at any moment x is 800 lb (coal) + 2 lb/ft * x ft (cable). Because as you lift x feet, the cable you've pulled up weighs 2x lb. So the total force at any x is 800 + 2x lb.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because that would mean the total force increases linearly. But when you lift up 800 lb, the cable's weight would be 2x lb for x feet. But since the entire 500 ft is being lifted, the maximum x is 500. So the total force at x is 800 + 2x lb.

So the work done would be the integral of this force over the distance from 0 to 500. So W = ∫ (800 + 2x) dx from 0 to 500.

Let me compute that. The integral of 800 is 800x, and the integral of 2x is x². So evaluating from 0 to 500:

W = [800*(500) + (500)^2] - [0 + 0] = 800*500 + 250,000.

800*500 is 400,000. Adding 250,000 gives 650,000 ft-lb. So the work done is 650,000 ft-lb.

Looking at the options, option F is 650,000 ft-lb. So that's the answer.

To calculate the work done in lifting 800 lb of coal up a 500 ft deep mine shaft using a cable that weighs 2 lb/ft, we model the problem using a Riemann sum and an integral. The total force at any height \( x \) is the sum of the coal's weight (800 lb) and the cable's weight (\( 2x \) lb). Thus, the force function is \( F(x) = 800 + 2x \) lb. The work done is the integral of this force over the distance from 0 to 500 ft:

\[
W = \int_{0}^{500} (800 + 2x) \, dx
\]

Evaluating the integral:

\[
W = \left[ 800x + x^2 \right]_0^{500} = (800 \times 500) + (500)^2 = 400,000 + 250,000 = 650,000 \, \text{ft-lb}.
\]

The correct answer is \( 650,000 \, \text{ft-lb} \).
