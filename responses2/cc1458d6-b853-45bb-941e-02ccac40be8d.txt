Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about general partnerships and their profit-sharing relationships. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

The question says, "Which statement best describes the profit sharing relationship of a general partnership where the partners have agreed only on voting percentage and the voting shares are unequal?" Oh right, general partnerships don't have to deal with individual contributions or experience; they're more about profit sharing based on their actions.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Experience and expertise. Wait, that's more of an accounting concern, like a partnership with stock or something else. I don't think that's how profit shares work in general. Profit sharing is usually about ownership or voting, not past performance.

Option B: Contributions to capital and assets. That's more about ownership based on their ownership in the business, not voting. So voting percentage is about their share, not their actual contributions.

Option C: Voting percentage. Oh, yes, this sounds familiar. In a general partnership, each partner has a voting interest, and the partners' shares are based on how much they vote. If they vote more, they get a larger share. So this seems correct.

Option D: Unanimous agreement. No, that's more about how the partnership is formed. Profit sharing isn't determined by a majority vote, especially in general partnerships where you can't just pass a profit and take it all.

Option E: Role in the partnership. Again, voting is based on role, not their role in the business. So this is about voting, not their actual business involvement.

Option F: Predetermined ratio. That's more about a specific agreement at the start, like a 50-50 split. The question says the voting shares are unequal, so this doesn't fit.

Option G: Time spent. No, that's not how profits are split either. It's based on their voting, which is a percentage.

Option H: Third-party arbitrator. No, I don't think so. Profit sharing is about the partnership's agreement, not a third party deciding it.

Option I: Equal share. That's not the case here, since the question states unequal shares.

Option J: Individual profits. Profit shares relate to the actual profit, not individual profits. So this is about how profits are distributed, not their ownership share.

So the correct answer should be option C. The profit shares are determined by their voting percentage.
</think>

The correct answer is:

**C: Partners share in proportion to their voting percentage.**

In a general partnership, profit shares are determined by voting percentage, as each partner has a voting interest proportional to their contribution. This ensures that profits are distributed based on their ownership, not their contributions to capital or assets.
