Okay, so I have this problem here about a hydraulic press and the decrease in oil volume. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through. Alright, the volume of oil is 5 ft³. The pressure is 2000 lb/in². And the compressibility is given as 20 × 10^-6 per atm. I need to find the decrease in volume. 

Wait, compressibility... I remember that compressibility is how much a material decreases in volume under pressure. The formula I think is delta V over V equals -k delta P. Oh right, because when you compress a material, its volume decreases, so delta V is negative.

So let me write that down. Delta V = -k * delta P * V. Wait, but wait, I think the equation is delta V = -k * delta P. Because k is the compressibility, which is a volume change per pressure change. So yeah, it's a negative because volume decreases.

Wait, but wait, what's the unit here? The given pressure is in lb/in². I remember that compressibility is usually given in terms of pressure units. Oh, and the standard unit for compressibility is per atm. So I need to convert the given pressure into atmospheres.

So first, pressure in lb/in². Let's convert that to atm. I think 1 atm is about 14.703 lb/in². Let me double-check: yes, 1 atm is approximately 14.7 psi. So 2000 psi is how many atm? So 2000 / 14.703. Let me compute that. 2000 divided by 14.703 is approximately 135.686 atm. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, 2000 / 14.703 is about 135.686? Let me compute: 14.703 * 135 ≈ 1999.995, almost 2000. So 2000 / 14.703 ≈ 135.686 atm. So approximately 135.686 atm.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 14.7 psi is 1 atm. So 2000 psi is 2000/14.7 ≈ 135.686 atm. So k is 20e-6 per atm, right? The compressibility is given as 20 × 10^-6 per atm. So we have k = 20e-6 atm^-1.

So delta P is 135.686 atm.

Now, plugging into delta V = -k * delta P * V.

Wait, but wait, the original volume is 5 ft³. So let me calculate.

So delta V = (-20e-6 atm^-1) * (135.686 atm) * (5 ft³).

Let me compute the numbers step by step.

First, 20e-6 is 2e-5. Multiply that by 135.686: 2e-5 * 135.686 = approx 0.00271372.

Then multiply that by 5: 0.00271372 * 5 = 0.0135686.

So delta V is approximately -0.0135686 ft³. But wait, looking at the options, option D is -0.0136 ft³, which is very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculations because I might have messed up somewhere.

Wait, another way: the formula is delta V = -k * delta P * V.

delta V = - (20e-6) * (2000) * 5.

Wait, wait! Wait a second. Wait, no: 2000 lb/in² is the pressure. So that's correct. But 20e-6 per atm. So 20e-6 * 2000 = 0.04 per atm? Wait, no. Oh no, wait, 20e-6 atm^-1 multiplied by 2000 atm equals 0.04. So delta V = -0.04 * 5 = -0.20. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier calculation.

Wait, no, no, wait again. Let me make sure. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting pressure to atm. Let me recheck that. 

2000 lb/in² is equal to how many atm? Since 1 atm = 14.703 lb/in². So 2000 / 14.703 is approximately 135.686 atm. So 135.686 atm.

Wait, wait, but the units in the formula for delta V are such that delta V is in (volume change), so it's (compressibility in 1/ atm) * pressure in atm) * V. So delta V would be in (since volume is in ft³, and pressure is in atm, but the ratio is 1/ atm, so units-wise, it's (1/ atm) * atm * ft³ = ft³, which is correct.)

So, delta V = -k * delta_P * V.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think about the units correctly. Let me reevaluate:

k is 20e-6 per atm.

delta_P = 2000 lb/in² → which is 2000 / 14.703 atm ≈ 135.686 atm.

So, delta V = - (20e-6 atm^-1) * (135.686 atm) * (5 ft³).

Multiplying the terms: 20e-6 * 135.686 = (20 * 135.686) * 1e-6 = 2713.72 * 1e-6 = 0.00271372.

Multiply by 5: 0.00271372 *5 = 0.0135686.

So delta V = -0.0135686 ft³. So approximately -0.0136 ft³. But wait, looking at the options, option D is -0.0136. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but what about the units? Let me check: k is per atm, so the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of multiplication. Let's think again.

Wait, wait another approach: delta V = -k * (delta_P) * V.

Wait, but wait, wait, no, k is 20e-6 per atm, and delta_P is in atm. So when you multiply, the units are (1/ atm) * atm = dimensionless, so delta V is in ft³, which is correct.

So the calculation seems correct.

So the answer is option D: -0.0136 ft³.

To determine the decrease in volume of the oil under the given pressure, we use the formula for compressibility:

\[
\Delta V = -k \cdot \Delta P \cdot V
\]

### Step 1: Convert Pressure to Atm
The pressure is given as \( 2000 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \). Since \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 14.703 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \), we convert:

\[
\Delta P = \frac{2000}{14.703} \approx 135.686 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 2: Plug Values into the Formula
The compressibility \( k \) is \( 20 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{per atm} \), and the initial volume \( V \) is \( 5 \, \text{ft}^3 \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Delta V = -(20 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (135.686) \cdot (5)
\]

### Step 3: Perform the Calculations
First, calculate \( 20 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 135.686 \):

\[
20 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 135.686 = 0.00271372
\]

Then multiply by \( 5 \):

\[
0.00271372 \cdot 5 = 0.0135686
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta V = -0.0135686 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The closest option to \( -0.0135686 \, \text{ft}^3 \) is \( -0.0136 \, \text{ft}^3 \), which corresponds to option D.
