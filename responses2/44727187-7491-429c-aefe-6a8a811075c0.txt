Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the average speeds of gases in a mixture. Hmm, I remember something about the kinetic molecular theory and the distribution of speeds. Let me see.

The question is about the mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen at a given temperature. They're asking which gas has the fastest average speed. Oh wait, right, the average speed of gas molecules depends on their molar mass, not their type. Because heavier molecules move slower on average.

Wait, but wait. So in a mixture, each gas contributes to the overall average speed. But individual molecules of each gas—like their own average speed—would each have a speed based on their molar mass. But the question is about the "fastest molecules on average" in the mixture. So each gas's molecules have their own average speeds.

I think each gas's molecules have their own average speed. So for hydrogen, its average speed is higher than for oxygen and nitrogen. Because hydrogen is lighter than oxygen and nitrogen. Because lighter molecules like hydrogen move faster.

So, nitrogen has an average speed lower than hydrogen. Oxygen is in between, I think. So among the gases, hydrogen would have the highest average speed, followed by oxygen, then nitrogen.

Wait, but the question is asking which group has the same average speed. Let me look at the options.

Option A says Nitrogen and hydrogen have the same average speed, but oxygen is slower. That's not right because hydrogen is lighter than nitrogen. So A is incorrect.

Option B says nitrogen is the answer. Well, that would imply that all the gases have the same average speed, but I don't think that's true. I think each has a different average speed.

Option C says hydrogen is the answer. That would imply that all others are slower. But no, hydrogen is the fastest. So C is wrong.

Option D says the speed depends on specific temperature and can't be determined. Well, I think temperature does affect average speed. But the question says the same temperature. Oh, but wait, each gas's average speed depends on molar mass, not temperature. The temperature affects the distribution, not the individual averages. So D's statement might be incorrect, but I'm not sure.

Option E: Oxygen and hydrogen have the same average speed. No, because hydrogen is lighter. So E is wrong.

Option F: Oxygen and hydrogen have same speed. No, same as E.

Option G: Speed depends on density. Hmm, I think that's not correct. The average speed depends on molar mass, not density. Density is mass/volume, which is different from average speed.

Option H: All same speed. No, same as G.

Option I: Speed independent of type, depends on volume. No, volume affects the number of molecules, but the average speed is per molecule, which depends on molar mass.

Option J: Oxygen. Well, that's a yes. Because oxygen is a heavier gas than hydrogen, so its average speed is lower than hydrogen's. But the question is about the fastest on average. So the fastest would be hydrogen. So J can't be the answer.

Wait, but the question is about the "fastest molecules on average" in the mixture. Oh wait, wait. The question is a bit confusing. It says, "the fastest molecules on average are those of..." So it's about the average speed of each type. So in the mixture, each gas's molecules have their own average speed. So the fastest among all gases is hydrogen. So the gases' molecules have varying speeds. So which of the options states that the fastest is hydrogen?

Looking back, option C says hydrogen has higher speed than others. So, the correct answer would be C: hydrogen.

Wait, but in the options, looking again. Option C says "Hydrogen has the highest average speed, followed by oxygen, then nitrogen."

So the question is, which gas has the fastest average speed on average. So the correct answer would be option C because hydrogen's average speed is higher than the others. So the correct choice is C.
</think>

The question asks which gas has the fastest average speed among hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen in a mixture. The average speed of gas molecules depends on their molar mass, with lighter molecules moving faster. Since hydrogen is the lightest, its average speed is the highest. Oxygen is heavier than hydrogen but lighter than nitrogen, so its average speed is slower than hydrogen but faster than nitrogen. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Nitrogen and hydrogen have different average speeds.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Nitrogen does not have the same average speed as hydrogen.
- **Option C**: Correct. Hydrogen has the highest average speed.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The speed depends on temperature, not on the type of gas.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Oxygen and hydrogen have different average speeds.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Oxygen and hydrogen have different average speeds.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The average speed depends on molar mass, not density.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The average speed depends on molar mass, not volume.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The average speed depends on molar mass, not volume.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Oxygen does not have the same average speed as hydrogen.
- **Option C** is correct because it accurately states that hydrogen has the highest average speed among the gases.
