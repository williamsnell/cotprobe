Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Tolstoy. Let me think through this step by step.

The question asks: "Before his conversion, what was Tolstoy surrounded by?" The options are A through J. I remember that Tolstoy was a Russian writer, and he was known for his deep philosophical insights and his life in the Russian Revolution.

I think about the context. Tolstoy's life was marked by a lot of turmoil. He was a revolutionary, so he must have been in a lot of conflict with the state. His family was also involved in revolutions. I remember that when he was young, he was in a difficult situation, maybe even in poverty because his family was working to make it better.

Looking at the options, let's see what each one represents. Option A says "things that no one would want." That sounds a bit like what Tolstoy had to work with. He was forced to live in poverty because his family couldn't afford it, so he had to find a way to make the least of what he had. So that fits with his life during the revolution.

Option B talks about deep insight, which I'm not sure about. I don't recall Tolstoy being known for deep philosophical insights in the same way, though he did write a lot of philosophical works like "Marxism and the Communist Revolution." So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C is "a life of poverty and hardship." That's what I'm thinking about. He might have had a life of hardship because his family was working to gain more for the state, and he had to make do with what he could afford. So this could be the correct answer.

Option D is about the pressures of aristocratic society. I'm not sure if that's what he was surrounded by. His family was part of a revolution, which was a form of aristocratic society, but more like a revolutionary class. So maybe he was under the pressures of a different class, but I'm not certain. I think his life was more about individual struggle rather than the social class.

Option E is "what is considered utter despair." I don't think that's the context. Despair would be more of a feeling rather than a place or situation. So E might not be correct.

Option F is "an abundance of wealth and power." That doesn't sound right either. His family had to work for their support, so he didn't have much wealth, and he didn't have much power at the time.

Option G is "what is considered complete happiness." I'm not sure if that's a correct metaphor for his situation. His life was a struggle, so maybe he didn't have complete happiness, but it doesn't fit the context as well as the other options.

Option H is "what is considered heavenly bliss." That's more of a religious or idealistic perspective, which doesn't fit his reality.

Option I is "a world of literature and art." Probably not, as literature and art were more for his personal enjoyment, not his environment.

Option J is "the turmoil of a war." That's a bit more about his political background, not exactly his personal or family situation.

So, putting it all together, the best answer seems to be A: things that no one would want. Because during his revolutionary time, he must have been surrounded by the harsh realities of poverty and hardship, which was a form of struggle, leading him to seek a more modest existence.

The correct answer is A: things that no one would want. 

Tolstoy's life was marked by a tumultuous period of revolution, where he faced a harsh reality of poverty and hardship. This situation forced him to seek a more modest existence, leading him to explore what he had and what he could make of it. Therefore, his surroundings before conversion were filled with the challenges and struggles of poverty and hardship. 

Answer: A
