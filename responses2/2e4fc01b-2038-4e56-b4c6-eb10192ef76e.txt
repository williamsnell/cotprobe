Okay, so I've got this question about opportunity costs and Nancy's choices. Let me try to break it down.

The question says Nancy can spend one hour studying, mowing the lawn for $6, or babysitting her niece for $8. She chose to study. We need to figure out which statement is true based on that choice.

Hmm, opportunity cost is the value of what you give up to choose an alternative. So if she's studying, the next best alternative is the option she's giving up. Let me look at the options.

Option A: The opportunity cost is $6, which equals the benefit from studying. Wait, so if she's studying, she gives up mowing the lawn for $6. But she chose to study, so the opportunity cost is the benefit she gives up, which is $6. So she's studying for a benefit of $6, but that's the cost of the next best option. So the statement says the opportunity cost equals the benefit from studying. Wait, but studying gives her some benefit, which is the benefit she's getting. So the opportunity cost is the next best alternative, which is $6. The statement says the opportunity cost equals the benefit. So if her studying gives her a benefit, say B, then the opportunity cost is the next best, which is $6. So B's benefit is not stated, but the opportunity cost for studying is $6, same as the next best. So the statement says opportunity cost is $6, which equals the benefit from studying. That would mean B's benefit is $6. So the opportunity cost is equal to the benefit of the next best alternative. So that's possible. But wait, what if her studying gives her more than $6? Then the opportunity cost would be $6, and her benefit (the gain from studying) would be more than $6. So the statement in A would be incorrect. So A is saying the opportunity cost equals the benefit. But if studying gives more than $6, then opportunity cost is $6, but the benefit is higher than $6, so A would be false.

Option B: Opportunity cost is $14, which is less than the benefit. Wait, how? Wait, the available options are mowing at $6, babysiting at $8. So the opportunity cost of studying would be the next best alternative, which is mowing for $6. So opportunity cost is $6. But option B says it's $14. That can't be right because 6 and 8 are the options. Unless I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says Nancy can do one of three things: study (benefit B), mow (6), or babysit (8). She chose to study. So the opportunity cost for studying is the highest of the other options. So the next best option is mowing at $6. So the opportunity cost is $6. So looking for which option says that.

Looking at the statements again:

Option B: Opportunity cost is $14, which is less than the benefit. That can't be right because 14 is more than available options. So B is probably wrong.

Option A: Opportunity cost is $6, which equals the benefit. Wait, if the opportunity cost is $6, and studying gives a benefit, say, B. So option A is saying B is $6. If that's the case, then the opportunity cost is B, so the statement is correct. But if her studying gives more than $6, then option A is wrong. So we need to figure out the correct scenario.

Wait, the question is about what's true given that she's chosen to study. So what's the correct statement about her choice.

So she studied, mowed, or babysat. She chose to study. The opportunity cost of studying is the next best alternative, which is mowing for $6. So opportunity cost is $6.

Now let's look at each option.

Option A: opportunity cost is $6, which equals the benefit. So if the benefit of studying is $6, then A is correct. But if the benefit is more, then the statement is false. But the question is, based on her choice, which is true.

Wait, but the question is about the statement that is true given her choice. So for her to have chosen to study, the benefit she got from studying must be higher than the opportunity cost of $6. Because if the benefit was $6, she would be indifferent between studying and mowing. If her studying gives more, she would have a higher utility.

So the statement that the opportunity cost is $6 and the benefit is equal to it would be incorrect if her study's benefit is higher. But the question is, what is necessarily true based on her choice.

So, considering the options:

A: opportunity cost = $6, which equals the benefit of studying.

But we don't know the benefit yet. Let's see. The next best option is mowing for $6, so opportunity cost is $6.

But the benefit of studying could be higher or lower.

If studying gives, say, $10, then opportunity cost is $6, which is less than the benefit. So the opportunity cost is $6, which is less than the benefit. So then the statement in A would be incorrect.

Wait, but if the opportunity cost is $6, and the benefit is $10, then the statement in A is incorrect because opportunity cost is less than the benefit.

But the question is, given that she chose to study, which is the true statement.

So the opportunity cost is $6, as it's the next best option. So looking at the options, the correct statement is about opportunity cost being $6, but what about the benefit?

Wait, the question is about whether the opportunity cost is equal to the benefit. That would only be true if the benefit is $6. But we don't know that.

So another angle: if the opportunity cost is the next best alternative, then the opportunity cost is the maximum of the other two options. So in this case, the next best alternative is mowing at $6. So the opportunity cost is $6.

So statement A says opportunity cost is $6, equal to the benefit. So if studying's benefit is $6, then A is correct. But if it's more, then it's incorrect.

But the question is, of the options, which is true.

Wait, the question is what is true about Nancy's choice. So if she chose to study, the opportunity cost is $6. So the only statements that are true are those that match this scenario.

So which options are correct?

Looking at options:

A: opportunity cost is $6, which equals the benefit. So correct only if B = $6.

B: opportunity cost is $14, which is less than the benefit. No, because 14 is higher than 8.

C: No other options besides these. No, because she can choose any of the three.

D: Nancy values studying more than $6. Wait, the opportunity cost is $6, so the benefit of studying is the value. So if she studied for more than $6, then opportunity cost is $6, which is less than the benefit. So D is saying she values it more than $6, which is correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but let's see all the options.

E: Indifferent to both. No, because she chose to study, so not indifferent.

F: Indifferent to all options. No, because she chose to study.

G: Benefit of studying is less than $8. No, because she chose to study, so her benefit must be higher than the next best option, which is $6.

H: Benefit is greater than $8. No, because she chose to study. So that's not possible.

I: Opportunity cost is $8. No, because opportunity cost is $6.

J: Nancy prefers babysitting but chose study. No, she chose study, and if the benefit is higher than $6, she would prefer it.

So back to the options.

Option D: Nancy values studying more than $6. That's correct. Because opportunity cost is $6, so studying gives more than that. So yes, D is correct.

Option B: opportunity cost is $14, which is less than the benefit. No, because 14 is higher than the available options.

Option E: Indifferent to both. No.

Option G: Benefit is less than $8: No, because she chose to study, which is better than mowing for $6 and babysitting for $8. So her benefit must be higher than $6.

So the correct statement is D: Nancy values studying more than $6. Because her opportunity cost is $6, so studying gives more than that.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H says benefit is greater than $8. No, that's not correct because she chose to study, which is better than mowing for $6. So her benefit is more than $6, but not necessarily more than $8. But the statement in H is that the benefit is greater than $8. That would mean her studying is more valuable than $8, which isn't necessarily the case.

So another angle: if the opportunity cost is $6, and she chose to study, then the benefit of studying must be more than $6. So her study is at least a little more than $6.

Looking at the options, D is correct, because she values it more than $6.
</think>

The opportunity cost of Nancy's choice to study is the next best alternative, which is mowing the lawn at $6. This means the opportunity cost is $6. However, the benefit of studying could be more than $6, as she chose to study over other options. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: This is incorrect because Nancy's opportunity cost is $6, not $6 equal to the benefit unless her studying's benefit is $6.
- **B**: Incorrect because $14 is higher than available options and cannot be the opportunity cost.
- **C**: Incorrect because Nancy has multiple options available.
- **D**: Correct because the opportunity cost is $6, and Nancy values studying more than this amount.
- **E**: Incorrect because Nancy chose to study, not being indifferent.
- **F**: Incorrect because Nancy chose to study, not being indifferent.
- **G**: Incorrect because her studying's benefit is greater than $6.
- **H**: Incorrect because her studying's benefit is not necessarily greater than $8.
- **I**: Incorrect because the opportunity cost is $6, not $8.
- **J**: Incorrect because Nancy preferred studying over other options, not mowing.

The correct answer is **D**, as Nancy's studying's benefit is greater than $6, making the opportunity cost $6.
