Okay, so I've got this question here about computing the speed of sound in steel rails. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, what do I remember about the speed of sound in materials? Oh right, the speed of sound in a solid is different from in a fluid. I think the formula involves Young's modulus and the density of the material. Oh wait, from what I've studied, the formula is something like v = sqrt(Y / ρ), where Y is Young's modulus and ρ is density.

The problem gives me the weight density (which I think is the same as density) of steel, which is 490 lb/ft³. And the Young's modulus is 29 x 10^6 lb/in². Wait, units are a bit different here. I should convert the modulus into the same units as density to avoid mistakes.

Density is given in lb/ft³. Young's modulus is in lb/in². I know that 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1 ft³ is (12 in)^3 = 1728 in³. So, 1 lb/ft³ is equal to (lb/(12 in)^3) = (lb)/(1728 in³). So, 490 lb/ft³ equals 490 / 1728 lb/in³. Let me calculate that. 490 divided by 1728 is approximately 0.284 lb/in³. Oh wait, maybe I should double-check that calculation. 1728 is about 1.728e3, so 490 / 1728 is approximately 0.284 lb/in³.

Now, the Young's modulus is 29 x 10^6 lb/in². So, Y is 29e6 lb/in², and ρ is about 0.284 lb/in³.

Putting it into the formula: v = sqrt( (Y)/(ρ) ) = sqrt( (29e6) / (0.284) )

Let me calculate the division inside the square root first. 29e6 divided by 0.284. Let's see, 29e6 is 29,000,000. Divided by 0.284, so what's that number?

Hmm, 0.284 is approximately 0.284. So 29e6 / 0.284 ≈ 29e6 * (1/0.284). Let's approximate 1/0.284. 1 divided by 0.28 is about 3.57. 1/0.284 is a little higher. Let's compute 1/0.284: 0.284 * 3.5 is 0.994, which is close to 1. So approximately 3.55.

So 29e6 * 3.55 ≈ 29 *3.55e6. 29 *3 is 87, 29 *0.55 is 15.95, so total is about 102.95e6. So about 1.0295e8.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 29e6 / 0.284.

Let me compute 29e6 / 0.284:

= (29 / 0.284) * 1e6

29 /0.284 = 29 * (1/0.284) = 29 * 3.521 ≈ 102.109.

So 102.109e6, which is 1.02109e8.

So the square root of 1.02109e8 is sqrt(1.02109e8) = sqrt(1.02109) * 1e4. Because sqrt(1e8) is 1e4 (since (1e4)^2 = 1e8). Now, sqrt(1.02109) is approximately 1.0105. So multiplying that by 1e4 gives about 1.0105e4 ft/s.

Wait, that's about 10,105 ft/s. Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 1.6e4 (16,000) seems higher, option F is 1.4e4 (14,000), and option J is 2.1e4 (21,000). Wait, but I'm getting around 1.01e4, which is about 10,000 ft/s. But none of the options are that low. Wait, I must have made a mistake in my unit conversion.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me double-check the Young's modulus and density units.

Wait, the problem says the weight density (weight per unit volume) is 490 lb/ft³. Young's modulus is 29 x10^6 lb/in². Oh wait, 1 lb/in² is a very large unit. Because in the imperial system, 1 psi (pound per square inch) is a lot. But wait, Young's modulus is usually in psi, but in the formula, it's in the same units as density.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the conversion. Let's try it again.

Density ρ is 490 lb/ft³. To convert this to lb/in³, since 1ft = 12in, so 1 ft³ is (12in)^3 = 1728 in³. Therefore, 1 lb/ft³ = 1 lb / (1728 in³) = (1/1728) lb/in³.

So ρ = 490 lb/ft³ = 490/(1728) lb/in³ ≈ 0.284 lb/in³.

Young's modulus Y is 29e6 lb/in². So, let me compute Y/ρ.

Y=29e6 lb/in², ρ=0.284 lb/in³.

(Y)/(ρ) = (29e6) / (0.284) (unit is (lb/in²) / (lb/in³) ) → (lb/(in²)) * (in³/lb) ) → (in³ * lb )/(in² * lb) ) → in/in² → which is in/in²? Wait, no, let me think. Wait, 29e6 has units of lb/in², and ρ is lb/in³. So when you divide Y by ρ, the units would be (lb/(in²)) / (lb/in³) ) → (lb / in²) * (in³/lb) → (in³)/(lb) * (lb)/(in²) → wait, no, maybe I'm getting units wrong here. Let me do the calculation:

Y has units lb/in², ρ has units lb/in³.

So Y / ρ = (lb/(in²)) / (lb/in³) ) → (lb/(in²)) * (in³/lb) ) → (in³) / (in²) → in. So units are inches. Hmm, but that doesn't match the formula which should give velocity in ft/s. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the formula I used earlier was v= sqrt(Y/ρ), but units-wise, that would be (lb/in²) / (lb/in³) ) = (in³)/(in²) ) → in. But the speed should be in ft/s. So maybe I made a mistake in the units conversion. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is v = sqrt(Y * (1/(3ρ))), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is v = sqrt( (Y)/(ρ) ) * (some constant factor), but I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Another approach: Maybe I should use the formula for the speed of sound in a rod, which is v = sqrt( (Y)/(ρ) ) * (1/ (1 + (1/3) (α/γ) )) ), where α is the coefficient of linear expansion and γ is the coefficient of volume expansion. But if the temperature is the same for both, then α/γ is a constant. But wait, the problem doesn't mention temperature changes, so perhaps we can ignore the (1 + ... ) factor and use v = sqrt( Y/(3ρ) ).

Wait, no. Wait, I think the correct formula is v = (1/√(3)) * sqrt( Y/ρ )

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. I think the speed of sound in a solid is given by v = (1/√(3)) * sqrt( Y/ρ ), where Y is Young's modulus and ρ is density. Wait, but in some references, it's stated as v = sqrt( (Y)/(3ρ) ), which is the same thing.

So the formula is v = sqrt( Y / (3 * ρ) )

So let me redo the calculation with that.

Y = 29e6 lb/in².

ρ is 490 lb/ft³ = 490/(12^3) lb/in³ = 490/1728 ≈ 0.284 lb/in³.

So Y/(3 * ρ) = (29e6) / (3 * 0.284) ) = (29e6) / (0.852) ≈ 337, 883, 000.

Wait, no, 29e6 is 29,000,000. Divided by 0.852. Let me compute that.

29,000,000 / 0.852 = ?

Well, 0.852 is approximately 0.85. 29,000,000 / 0.85 = let's compute 29e6 / 0.85.

0.85 * 34,000,000 = 29,950,000. Hmm, so 34.0e6 is about 29.95e6. So 29e6 is about 34.0e6 minus a bit. So 34.0e6 - (0.95e6) = 33.05e6.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Using calculator-like approach:

Compute 29,000,000 ÷ 0.852.

Let me do this division step by step.

0.852 is approximately 0.852 = 852/1000.

So 29,000,000 ÷ 0.852 = (29e6) * (1000/852) ) ≈ 29e6 * 1.171875.

Wait, 1000/852 is approximately 1.171875.

So 29e6 * 1.171875 = ?

29e6 * 1 = 29e6.

29e6 * 0.171875 = 29e6 * (0.1 + 0.07 +0.001875) → 29e6*(0.1)=2.9e6; 0.07 is 2.03e6; 0.001875 is 51.75e3.

Wait, adding them: 2.9e6 + 2.03e6 =4.93e6 + 51.75e3=4.9815e6.

So total is 29e6 +4.9815e6 =33.9815e6.

So approximately 33.9815e6.

So the value under the square root is 33.9815e6 → sqrt(33.9815e6) = sqrt(33.9815) * 1e3.

What's the square root of 33.9815? Let's see: 5.8^2 =33.64. 5.8^2 =33.64, 5.81^2=33.7561, 5.82^2=33.8724, 5.83^2= 33.9489. 5.83^2 is 33.9489, 5.83^2 is 33.9489.

Wait, 5.83² = (5 +0.83)^2 =25 + 2*5*0.83 + (0.83)^2=25 +8.3 +0.6889=33.9889.

So 5.83² is approximately 33.9889. Our value is 33.9815, which is just a bit less than 33.9889. So the square root is approximately 5.83 - (0.0074)/(2*5.83) → using linear approximation.

Difference between 5.83² and our target is 33.9889 - 33.9815=0.0074.

So sqrt(33.9815) ≈ 5.83 - 0.0074/(2*5.83) ) → 5.83 - (0.0037)/5.83 ≈ 5.83 - 0.000634 → about 5.829366.

So sqrt(33.9815e6) = 5.829366e3 → approximately 5829.366 ft/s.

But wait, our calculation gave us about 5829 ft/s. Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 1.4e4 ft/s is 14,000, which is about 2.3 times higher than our result. Hmm, so that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the unit conversion?

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the units again. Because I think I messed up the conversion from in³ to ft³ earlier. Oh wait, no: when I converted density from lb/ft³ to lb/in³, I did 490 lb/ft³ = 490/(12)^3 lb/in³. 12^3 is 1728, so 490/1728 ≈ 0.284 lb/in³. That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted the modulus in a different way. Let me think. What is the Young's modulus in the correct units for the formula?

The formula I'm using is v = sqrt( Y/(3ρ) ), but I'm not sure about the units. Because the units of Y are lb/in², and rho is lb/in³. So Y/(rho) is (lb/in²) / (lb/in³) ) = (lb in³) / (in² lb) ) → (in³)/(in²) → in. So the units would be in. Since velocity is in ft/s, perhaps I should convert the result into ft/s.

Wait, hold on. That suggests that using the formula sqrt( Y/(3ρ) ), without a conversion factor, gives the speed in inches per second. So I need to convert inches per second to feet per second.

So, let me proceed.

So Y =29e6 lb/in².

ρ=0.284 lb/in³.

So Y/(3ρ) = (29e6) / (3 * 0.284) → 29e6 / approx 0.852 → 33.9815e6.

So sqrt(33.9815e6) is sqrt(33.9815) * 1e3 → approximately 5.83e3 in/s.

Wait, 5.83e3 in/s → 5.83e3 / 12 in/s → 5.83e3 /12 = 485.83 ft/s.

Wait, 5830 inches per second → 5830 / 12 = approx 485 ft/s.

But that's from 5830 in/s. So 5830 / 12 = 485.83 ft/s.

Hmm, but none of the options are around 485 ft/s. The closest is J:2.1e4 which is 21000 ft/s. So that's a big gap. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula isn't sqrt(Y/(3ρ)), but sqrt(Y/(ρ)), without the 1/3? Let me think again.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find another approach.

Alternative approach: The speed of sound in a rod is given by v = (1/√3) * sqrt(Y/ρ).

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Let me see. The speed of sound in a solid is given by v = (1/√3) * sqrt( Y/(ρ) )

Wait, so let me compute that.

Y = 29e6 lb/in².

ρ=490 lb/ft³ = 490/(12^3) = 490/1728 ≈ 0.284 lb/in³.

So Y/(ρ) = (29e6)/(0.284) ≈ 1.021e8. So sqrt(1.021e8) = 1e4 * sqrt(1.021) ≈ 1e4 * 1.01045 = 10,104.5 ft/s.

But again, this is not matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the formula is v = sqrt( (Y)/(3ρ) ), which would give a lower speed, but that doesn't align with the earlier result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different unit conversion. Let me try using metric units.

Density ρ =490 lb/ft³. Let's convert this to kg/m³.

1 lb = 0.453592 kg.

1 ft = 0.3048 m.

So, 490 lb/ft³ = (490 * 0.453592 kg) / (0.3048 m)^3 )

Compute the denominator: (0.3048)^3 = approx 0.0283168 m³.

So, numerator: 490 * 0.453592 ≈ 490 * 0.4536 ≈ 222.1464 kg.

So, density in kg/m³ is 222.1464 / 0.0283168 ≈ 7,821.5 kg/m³.

Young's modulus Y is 29e6 psi. Wait, what's psi? Pounds per square inch.

1 psi = 64.8048 kg/(m²) or 689.4758 Pa.

Wait, no, 1 psi is approximately 689.4758 Pa. So 29e6 psi = 29e6 * 689.4758 Pa.

So, Y = 29e6 * 689.4758 ≈ let's compute this.

But perhaps alternatively, let me compute Y in SI units.

1 psi = 689.476 Pa. So 29e6 psi = 29e6 * 689.476 Pa ≈ 29e6 * 6.89476e3 → 29 *6.89476e9 → approximately 199.5e9 Pa.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Y in terms of Pa (Pascals), since 1 psi is 689.476 Pa.

So, Y =29e6 psi =29e6 * 689.476 Pa → 29e6 * 6.89476e3 = 29 *10^6 *6.89476 *10^3 = (29 *6.89476) *10^9 ≈ 201.06 *10^9 Pa → 2.0106e11 Pa.

So, Y=2.0106e11 Pa.

Then, the formula v = sqrt( (Y)/(3ρ) )

So Y/(3ρ) = (2.0106e11 Pa) / (3 * 7821.5 kg/m³ )

Compute denominator: 3 *7821.5=23464.5 kg/m³.

So Y/(3ρ) = 2.0106e11 / 2.34645e4 ≈ 2.0106e11 / 2.34645e4 → 2.0106 / 2.34645 → approximately 0.856. So 0.856e(11-4) → 0.856e7 → 8.56e6.

Wait, no, actually 2.0106e11 / 2.34645e4 = (2.0106 / 2.34645) * 1e7 → approx 0.856 *1e7 → 8.56e6.

So sqrt(8.56e6 ) = sqrt(8.56e6) = 925.2 ft/s.

Wait, but I don't think this is correct because the answer options are 1.6e4 and 2.1e4, which are around 16,000 and 21,000 ft/s. My calculation here is 925 ft/s, which is way lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted the modulus Y into the correct units before applying the formula. Wait, perhaps I should have converted Y into Pascals, and rho into kg/m³ first, then compute Y/(3 rho), and take the square root.

Wait, let me try that approach again.

First, compute Y in Pa.

We have Y =29e6 psi.

1 psi = 689.476 Pa. So Y =29e6 * 689.476 Pa.

29e6 * 689.476 = let's compute it.

29 * 689.476 → 29 *689 = 20, 29*689.476=?

Wait, 689.476 * 29 = (689.476 *30) -689.476 → 20,684.28 -689.476 =20,  20,684.28 minus 689.476 is 19,994.804.

So 29e6 *689.476 =19,994.804e6 Pa → 1.9994804e10 Pa.

So Y=1.9994804e10 Pa.

Then, rho is 7821.5 kg/m³.

So Y/(3 rho) = (1.9994804e10) / (3 *7821.5) → (1.99948e10) / (23,464.5) → approx 8.56e6.

So sqrt(8.56e6 )= approx 925.2 ft/s.

Still way below the options. Hmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is v = sqrt( (Y)/(3ρ) ) * (1/12) or something. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different formula.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is v = (1/√(3)) * sqrt( Y/(1 + (1/3)(α/γ)) )

But this complicates things because it requires knowing the coefficient of linear expansion and volume expansion, which are temperature-dependent. Since the problem doesn't mention temperature changes, perhaps we can ignore this term.

So, perhaps the formula is v = (1/√3) * sqrt( Y/(rho) )

So, let me compute that.

Y=1.99948e10 Pa.

rho=7821.5 kg/m³.

So, Y/(rho)= 1.99948e10 /7821.5 ≈ 2.558e6.

Taking the square root: sqrt(2.558e6) = 1599.6 ft/s.

But that's still lower than the options given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion of Y. Maybe I should convert Y from psi to Pa differently. Let me check: 1 psi = 689.476 Pa. So 29e6 psi = 29e6 *689.476 Pa.

Wait, 29e6 *689.476 = 29 *689.476 *1e6 = 20,  29 *689.476 is 19,994.804 → 19,994.804e6 Pa → 1.9994804e10 Pa.

That's correct.

So, now, Y/(3 rho) = (1.9994804e10) / (3 *7821.5) ≈ 1.99948e10 /23464.5 ≈ approx 8.56e6.

So sqrt(8.56e6 )= approx 925 ft/s.

Hmm, still no match.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted rho into lb/ft³ differently. Let me double-check.

Density rho in lb/ft³: 490 lb/ft³.

Wait, 1 ft³ = 12³ cubic feet? No, wait, 1 ft³ = (12 in)^3 = 1728 in³. So, 1 lb/ft³ = 1 lb/(12³ in³) = (1/1728) lb/in³.

So, 490 lb/ft³ = 490 * 1728 lb/in³.

Wait, no, wait: 1 lb/ft³ = (1 lb)/( (12 in)^3 ) = (1 lb) / (1728 in³) = 1/1728 lb/in³. So, 490 lb/ft³ = 490 * (1/1728) lb/in³ = 490/(1728) lb/in³ ≈ 0.284 lb/in³.

That's correct.

So, I think I'm stuck. The calculations give me about 925 ft/s, but the options given are 1.6e4, 2.2e4, 3e4, 2.5e4, 1.4e4.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try using another approach.

Another approach: The speed of sound in a rod is given by v = (1/√3) * sqrt( Y/(rho) ), where Y is the modulus and rho is the density.

So, let's compute that again.

Y =29e6 psi =29e6 *689.476 Pa ≈ 1.99948e10 Pa.

rho=490 lb/ft³ =0.284 lb/in³.

So, Y/(rho) =1.99948e10 Pa / 0.284 lb/in³.

Wait, but Pa is kg/(m·s²). lb/in³ is lb/(in³). So, let me compute the units.

Wait, actually, perhaps I should express everything in consistent units, like Pa and kg/(m·s²), but this might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should avoid converting units and keep Y in psi and rho in lb/in³, to see if that approach gives the same result.

So, Y/(rho) = (29e6 psi) / (0.284 lb/in³).

Wait, but psi is in terms of Pa. Let me convert psi to Pa.

1 psi = 689.476 Pa.

So, Y/(rho) = 29e6 *689.476 Pa / 0.284 lb/in³.

Wait, but lb/in³ is a density, and Pa is a pressure. So their ratio is a unitless quantity, which is the same as (Y in Pa) / (rho in kg/m³).

Wait, but from the formula v = sqrt( Y/(rho) ), but only when Y is in Pa and rho is in kg/m³.

Wait, perhaps I can convert Y from psi to Pa, and rho from lb/in³ to kg/m³.

So, let's try that.

Y =29e6 psi =29e6 *689.476 Pa ≈1.99948e10 Pa.

rho=490 lb/in³.

We need to express rho in kg/m³. So, 1 lb = 0.453592 kg.

1 in =0.0254 m.

So, 1 lb/in³ = 0.453592 kg / (0.0254 m)^3 → kg/m³.

Compute numerator:0.453592 kg.

Denominator: (0.0254)^3 m³ = approx 0.00001638 m³.

So, 1 lb/in³ = 0.453592 / 0.00001638 kg/m³ → approximately 27,680 kg/m³.

Wait, 0.453592 /0.00001638 = let's compute:

0.453592 /0.00001638 → divide numerator and denominator by 0.000001 → 0.453592 /0.01638 → approx 27.68 kg/m³.

Wait, 0.453592 / 0.00001638 → 0.453592 / 1.638e-5 = 0.453592 * (1/1.638e-5 ) → 0.453592 * 61,130 ≈ 27,680 kg/m³.

So, 1 lb/in³ =27,680 kg/m³.

So, rho=490 lb/in³ =490 *27,680 kg/m³ =490 *27,680 = let's compute.

490 *27,680 → 490 *27,680 = 490 * (2.768e4 )= approx 490*2.768e4= let's compute 490 *2.768e4:

Compute 490 *2.768e4 = (490 *2.768) *1e4.

Compute 490 *2.768: 490 *2=980, 490 *0.768= approx 490 *0.7=343, 490*0.068≈33.32 → total 343+33.32=376.32 → 980 + 376.32=1356.32.

So, 490 *2.768e4 =1356.32 *1e4 =13,563,200 kg/m³.

So, rho=1.35632e7 kg/m³.

Now, Y/(rho) =1.99948e10 Pa /1.35632e7 kg/m³.

But Pa is kg/(m·s²), and kg/m³ is 1/s².

So, Y/(rho) = (kg/(m·s²)) / (kg/m³) ) → (kg/(m·s²)) * (m³/kg) ) → (1/(s²)).

So, the units simplify to 1/s².

Now, v = sqrt( Y/(rho) ) → sqrt( 1/s² ) → 1/s.

But 1/s is velocity in terms of 1/s. Wait, but I need to get it in ft/s.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the numerical value.

Y/(rho) =1.99948e10 /1.35632e7 → approx 1.99948e10 /1.35632e7 → 1.99948 /1.35632 → approx 1.477 → 1.477e3 → 1477 s^-1.

Wait, no, because 1/s is velocity. So, 1477 s^-1 is 1477 m/s.

Wait, but that's not right because I thought Y/(rho) would be (1/s²), and the square root of that would be 1/s, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the units again.

Wait, perhaps Y is in Pa, rho in kg/m³. So, Y/(rho) = Pa/(kg/m³) ) → (kg/(m·s²)) ) / (kg/m³) ) → (kg/(m·s²)) * m³/kg ) → m²/s².

Wait, that can't be. Let me recompute.

Pa is kg/(m·s²).

kg/m³ is kg/m³.

So, Pa/(kg/m³) ) = (kg/(m·s²)) ) / (kg/m³) ) → (kg/(m·s²)) ) * (m³/kg) ) → (m²)/s².

So, Y/(rho) = m²/s².

Then, v = sqrt( Y/(rho) ) = m/s.

So, v is in m/s.

But I'm getting Y/(rho) = (m²/s² ), so square root gives m/s.

So, let me compute that.

Y/(rho) =1.99948e10 /1.35632e7 → approx 1.99948e10 /1.35632e7 → 1.99948e10 /1.35632e7 → 1.99948 /1.35632 → approx 1.477 → 1.477e3 → 1477 s^-1.

Wait, no, because 1e10 / 1e7 = 1e3. So, 1.99948e10 / 1.35632e7 = (1.99948 /1.35632) *1e3 → approx 1.477 *1e3 →1477 s^-1.

Wait, but that can't be correct because earlier calculations gave me about 925 ft/s, which is about 280 m/s. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 1.99948e10 /1.35632e7.

1.99948e10 is 19,994,800,000.

1.35632e7 is 13,563,200.

So, 19,994,800,000 /13,563,200 = approx 1477.

Yes, so Y/(rho) =1477 s^-1.

Then, v = sqrt(1477) m/s → approx 38.43 m/s.

Wait, but earlier when I converted everything into SI units, I got about 925 ft/s, which is about 280 m/s. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests I might have made a mistake in unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have kept everything in the same units to avoid confusion.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted Y from psi to Pa, and rho from lb/in³ to kg/m³, then compute Y/(rho), and then take the square root.

So, step by step.

1. Convert Y from psi to Pa.

Y =29e6 psi.

1 psi =689.476 Pa.

So, Y =29e6 *689.476 Pa ≈1.99948e10 Pa.

2. Convert rho from lb/in³ to kg/m³.

1 lb =0.453592 kg.

1 in =0.0254 m.

So, 1 lb/in³ =0.453592 kg / (0.0254 m)^3 → kg/m³.

Compute denominator:

(0.0254)^3 = 0.0254 *0.0254 *0.0254 =0.000016384 m³.

So, 1 lb/in³ =0.453592 kg /0.000016384 m³ → kg/m³.

Compute 0.453592 /0.000016384 → 0.453592 /1.6384e-5 → 0.453592 *61,130 →approx 27,680 kg/m³.

So, rho=490 lb/in³ =490 *27,680 kg/m³ =490 *27,680 =13,563,200 kg/m³.

3. Compute Y/(rho ) =1.99948e10 Pa /13,563,200 kg/m³.

As before, 1.99948e10 /1.35632e7 =1477 s^-1.

4. Now, compute v = sqrt(Y/(rho )) = sqrt(1477) m/s ≈38.43 m/s.

Wait, but earlier when I converted everything into pounds and inches, I got around 925 ft/s, which is about 275 m/s. Which is close to 38.43 m/s? No, they don't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversions.

Wait, let me double-check the Y/(rho) calculation.

Y =29e6 psi =29e6 *689.476 Pa ≈29e6 *689.476.

29e6 is 29,000,000.

29,000,000 *689.476 = let's compute 29,000,000 *700 =20,300,000,000, but minus 29,000,000 *10.524.

Wait, 689.476 =700 -10.524.

So, 29,000,000 *700 =20,300,000,000.

29,000,000 *10.524 =305,240,000.

So, Y=20,300,000,000 -305,240,000 =20,300,000,000 -305,240,000 =20,300,000,000 -305,240,000 =20,300,000,000 -305,240,000 =20,299,694,800 Pa.

So Y≈20,299,694,800 Pa.

Rho=490 lb/in³ =490 *27,680 kg/m³ =490 *27,680.

490 *27,680 = let's compute 490 *27,680.

400 *27,680 =11,072,000.

90 *27,680 =2,491,200.

So, total rho =11,072,000 +2,491,200 =13,563,200 kg/m³.

So, Y/(rho ) =20,299,694,800 /13,563,200 ≈20,299,694,800 ÷13,563,200.

Let's compute 20,299,694,800 ÷13,563,200.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 20,299,694,800 ÷100 =202,996,948; 13,563,200 ÷100=135,632.

So, 202,996,948 ÷135,632 ≈ let's compute.

135,632 *1500 =135,632 *1000=135,632,000; 135,632 *500=67,816,000 → total 135,632,000 +67,816,000=203,448,000.

So, 135,632 *1500=203,448,000.

But numerator is 202,996,948, which is less than 203,448,000.

So, 202,996,948 -203,448,000 = -451,052.

So, 135,632 * (-1) = -135,632.

So, 203,448,000 -135,632 =203,312,368.

So, 135,632 *1500 -135,632 *1=203,312,368.

But numerator is 202,996,948, which is less than 203,312,368.

So, 202,996,948 -203,312,368 =-315,420.

So, it's about 135,632 *1499 =203,312,368 -135,632 =203,176,736.

Which is more than 202,996,948.

So, let's compute 135,632 *1499 =203,176,736.

203,176,736 -202,996,948 =180,000.

So, 202,996,948 =135,632 *1499 -180,000.

Hmm, so 202,996,948 ÷135,632 ≈1499 - (180,000 /135,632) →1499 -1.346= approx1497.654.

So, Y/(rho ) ≈1497.654 s^-1.

Then, v =sqrt(Y/(rho ))=sqrt(1497.654)= approx38.72 m/s.

Wait, now I have 38.72 m/s. But earlier, when I converted everything into pounds and inches, I got 925 ft/s, which is approximately 275 m/s. Hmm, so 38.72 is not matching 275. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier unit conversion.

Wait, let me recheck the unit conversion steps.

1. Y =29e6 psi.

1 psi =689.474 Pa.

So, Y =29e6 *689.474 Pa.

Compute 29e6 *689.474.

29e6 =29,000,000.

29,000,000 *689.474 = ?

Let's compute 29,000,000 *700 =20,300,000,000.

But 700 is 10.524 more than 689.474.

Wait, 700 -689.474 =10.526.

Wait, 689.474 =700 -10.526.

So, 29,000,000 *689.474 =29,000,000*(700 -10.526) =29,000,000*700 -29,000,000*10.526.

Compute 29,000,000*700=20,300,000,000.

29,000,000*10.526= 29,000,000 *10 =290,000,000; 29,000,000*0.526=15,260,000.

So, 29,000,000 *10.526=290,000,000 +15,260,000=295,260,000.

So, 29,000,000*689.474=20,300,000,000 -295,260,000=20,300,000,000 -295,260,000=20,000,000,000 - (300,000,000 - 295,260,000)=20,000,000,000 -48,740,000=19,951,260,000.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me compute 29,000,000 *689.474.

Another approach: 29,000,000 *689.474 =29e6 *689.474.

Compute 29e6 *689.474:

First, 29e6 *600=17,400,000,000.

29e6 *80=2,320,000,000.

29e6 *9=261,000,000.

29e6 *0.474=13,660,000.

Wait, let's compute 29e6 *689.474 as 29e6*(600+80+9+0.474).

So:

29e6 *600 =17,400,000,000.

29e6 *80 =2,320,000,000.

29e6 *9 =261,000,000.

29e6 *0.474= Compute 0.4 *29e6=11,200,000; 0.074*29e6=21,400,000. So total 11,200,000 +21,400,000=31,400,000.

So, adding all together:

17,400,000,000 +2,320,000,000 =19,700,000,000.

+261,000,000 →19,950,000,000.

+31,400,000 →19,951,400,000.

So, Y=19,951,400,000 Pa.

So, Y=19,951,400,000 Pa.

Now, Y/(rho )=19,951,400,000 Pa / rho.

We computed rho=490 lb/in³=13,563,200 kg/m³.

So, Y/(rho )=19,951,400,000 /13,563,200 = let's compute that.

13,563,200 *1,400 =13,563,200 *1,000=13,563,200,000; 13,563,200 *400=5,409,280,000 →13,563,200,000 +5,409,280,000=18,999,280,000.

13,563,200 *1,400=18,999,280,000.

Which is less than 19,951,400,000.

So, 13,563,200 *1,400=18,999,280,000.

Subtract:19,951,400,000 -18,999,280,000=952,100,000.

Now, 13,563,200 *x=952,100,000.

So, x=952,100,000 /13,563,200 ≈69.82.

So, total is 1,400 +0.6982≈1,400.6982.

So, Y/(rho )=1,400.6982 s^-1.

Then, v =sqrt(1,400.6982) ≈37.42 m/s.

So, approximately 37.42 m/s.

Wait, but earlier, when I used unit conversion from psi to Pa, I got Y=19,951,400,000 Pa, and rho=13,563,200 kg/m³.

So, Y/(rho )=19,951,400,000 /13,563,200 =1,400.6982 s^-1.

v =sqrt(1,400.6982)≈37.42 m/s.

Hmm, but earlier, when I converted everything into lb and inches, I ended up with 925 ft/s, which is approximately 275 m/s. So, from 925 ft/s, 925 /2.20107≈414 m/s. Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion steps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute Y/(rho ) in terms of Pa and kg/m³, then take the square root.

Let me compute Y/(rho )=19,951,400,000 /13,563,200 =1,400.6982 s^-1.

Then, v =sqrt(1,400.6982)≈37.42 m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Y/(rho ) in terms of Pa and kg/m³, then take the square root.

But perhaps I should compute Y/(rho ) in terms of ft·in²/(lb·in³), which would be in terms of (ft·in²)/(lb·in³) = (ft·in)/(lb).

Wait, let me calculate Y/(rho ) in terms of (ft·in)/(lb).

So, 1 psi =1 Pa =1 N/m² =1 kg/(m·s²) → Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 1 N =1 kg·m/s². So, 1 N/m² = (kg·m/s²)/m² = kg/(m·s²). But 1 kg/(m·s²) =1 Pa. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not the best.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute Y/(rho ) in terms of (ft·in)/(lb) and then take the square root to get ft/s.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Y/(rho ) in terms of (ft·in)/(lb) and then convert to m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute Y/(rho ) in terms of (ft·in)/(lb), and then take the square root to get ft/s.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute Y/(rho ) in terms of (ft·in)/(lb), then take the square root to get m/s.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to compute Y/(rho ) in terms of (ft·in)/(lb), then take the square root to get m/s.

Wait, perhaps the approach here is getting too complicated, and perhaps I should just accept the earlier calculation where Y/(rho )=1,400.698 s^-1, and v=sqrt(1,400.698)=37.42 m/s.

Wait, but earlier, when I used unit conversion from psi to Pa, I had 19,951,400,000 Pa, and rho=13,563,200 kg/m³, so Y/(rho )=19,951,400,000 /13,563,200≈1,400.698 s^-1.

Then, v=sqrt(1,400.698)=37.42 m/s.

Wait, but wait, when I calculated using the unit conversion of psi to Pa, I had 29e6 psi, which is 29,000,000 psi, which converts to 19,951,400,000 Pa.

Wait, but earlier, in the calculation, I had 29e6 psi=20,299,600,000 Pa.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial unit conversion.

Wait, let me recalculate Y=29e6 psi.

1 psi =1 Pa →1 psi=1 Pa. So, 29e6 psi=29e6 Pa.

But earlier, I had a mistake in that.

Wait, let me recalculate 29e6 psi to Pa.

1 psi is approximately 1 Pa. So, 29e6 psi=29e6 Pa.

So, Y=29e6 Pa.

Wait, that's different from the previous calculation where I had 19,951,400,000 Pa.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous calculation.

Wait, so let's recompute Y=29e6 psi *1 Pa/1 psi=29e6 Pa.

Similarly, rho=490 lb/in³=13,563,200 kg/m³.

So, Y/(rho )=29e6 /13,563,200 ≈2,000 /13,500 ≈0.1488.

Wait, but that can't be right.

Wait, let me compute 29e6 /13,563,200.

Compute 29e6 =29,000,000.

Divide 29,000,000 by13,563,200.

2.8e5 /1.35632e6 =0.1477.

Wait, so Y/(rho )=0.1477 s^-1.

Wait, then v=sqrt(0.1477)=0.3834 m/s.

Wait, that's a very low velocity. Hmm, that can't be right, since earlier I had 37 m/s.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion from psi to Pa.

Wait, 1 psi is approximately 1.9869976e-5 bar.

But 1 bar is 1 bar, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conversion factor 1 psi =6.895454e-3 kPa.

Wait, let me check.

Wait, 1 psi is about 6.895454e-3 kPa, which is 0.000689543 kPa.

But perhaps I should use a more exact conversion factor.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the conversion factor 1 psi =0.9869733333333333 Pa.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to just use a calculator to convert 29e6 psi to Pa.

Let me compute:

1 psi =1 Pa →1 psi=1 Pa. So, 29e6 psi=29e3 kPa.

Wait, but 1 kPa=1000 Pa.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of 1 psi=0.9869733333333333 Pa.

Wait, so 29e6 psi=29e6 *0.9869999999999999 Pa.

Compute 29e6 *0.9899999999999999.
