Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identity. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking what identity refers to. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that identity is a broad concept. It has to do with how you see yourself, what you believe about yourself, and how you feel about yourself. It's more than just being a certain way; it's about how you perceive yourself in relation to others and the world around you.

Looking at the options:

A: Financial status and societal position. Hmm, that's about economic status and where you stand in society. Not really the whole picture of identity, which is more about personal beliefs and feelings.

B: Control over one's own life story. That sounds like control, which is part of identity, but I'm not sure how direct it is. Identity is about more than just what you can control.

C: Level of intelligence and education. That's more about personal skills and background, not the broader sense of self and identity.

D: Individual perception of societal norms. That seems related to how you view others and the world, but identity isn't just about what you see; it's about how you see yourself.

E: Coherent sense of self. This sounds like it's about having a clear sense of oneself, which is part of identity. It's more about the internal self than external factors.

F: Physical appearance and overall personality. That's more about appearance, which is part of identity but not the comprehensive view.

G: Capacity to maintain emotional balance. That's about emotional regulation, which is important for identity but not the whole identity itself.

H: Use of a particular coping strategy. That's more about how you manage stress, which is a personal trait, not the identity concept.

I: Ability to adapt to change. This is about resilience, which can be a part of identity but isn't the main aspect.

J: Influence on others. That's about how others perceive you, which is part of identity but not the main component.

Wait, the question is asking which option defines identity. Identity is about how you see yourself in relation to others and the world. So, E says a coherent sense of self. That seems to fit because identity is about one's self-perception. I think E is the right answer.

The correct answer is E: Coherent sense of self. Identity refers to one's coherent sense of self, which encompasses how they perceive themselves and their role in the world. 

Answer: E
