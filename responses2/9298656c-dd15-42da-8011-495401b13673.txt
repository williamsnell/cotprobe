Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring a loop of 5 vertices using 3 colors. The question is asking how many ways we can do this so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Hmm, right, this sounds like a graph coloring problem. The graph here is a cycle with 5 nodes, right?

Wait, I remember something about counting colorings for cycles. Oh right, for a cycle graph with n vertices, the number of colorings where adjacent vertices are different is given by a formula involving (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1), where k is the number of colors. Or wait, no, another formula comes to mind. Maybe it's something like (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). Let me think again.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the number of proper colorings of a cycle graph is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5 and k=3, that would be (2)^5 + (1)^5 *2. Let's calculate that. 2^5 is 32, and 1^5 is 1, so 32 + 2 = 34? Wait, but that doesn't match the options given. Oh wait, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, another approach: think about the number of colorings for a line (path) and then adjust for the loop. For a path of 5 vertices, each adjacent pair must have different colors. The number of colorings is 3*2*2*2*2 = 3*16=48? Wait, no, that can't be right because for a path with n vertices, the number is k*(k-1)^(n-1). So for n=5, 3*2^4=48.

But since it's a loop, the first and last vertices are also adjacent. So we have to ensure that the first and last are different. So the total colorings without the loop condition are 48. But now we have to subtract those colorings where the first and last are the same.

Wait, no, that's inclusion-exclusion. Hmm, maybe a better way is to use the formula for the chromatic polynomial of a cycle. The chromatic polynomial for a cycle with n nodes is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So plugging in n=5, k=3: (2)^5 + (1)^5 * 2 = 32 + 2 = 34. But wait, the options don't include 34. Wait, let me check the options again.

Oh wait, the options are 60, 12, 30, 15, 36, 25, 50, 20, 24, 48. Hmm, 34 isn't an option. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Another approach: for a cycle, the number of colorings is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). Wait, but wait, when n is even, it's (k-1)^n + (k-1). So for n=5 (odd), it's (k-1)^n - (k-1). So for n=5, k=3: 2^5 - 2 = 32-2=30. Oh! That gives 30, which is option C. But why? Let me think again.

Wait, when n is odd, the number is (k-1)^n - (k-1). Wait, but wait, what's the correct formula? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, another formula I remember is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that's 32 + 2=34. But that's not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step. Let's think about the number of colorings for a cycle. Alternatively, use the recurrence for cycles. For a cycle, the number of colorings is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, k=3: (2)^5 + (1)^5 * 2 = 32 + 2 =34. But that's 34, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). Wait, but that gives 34. But the options don't have 34. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of colorings for a cycle as (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). Let me plug in n=5, k=3: (2)^5 is 32, (-1)^5 is -1, times (k-1) which is 2: so total is 32 + (-1)*2 =30. Oh, that gives 30, which is option C.

But wait, why does the formula have a plus or minus? Maybe I should think about the number of colorings for a cycle as (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, it's (2)^5 - 2 = 30.

Alternatively, another way to calculate for a cycle is to consider that it's a cycle, so for each vertex, the number of options is (k-1) for the first vertex, and for each subsequent vertex, it's (k-1) minus the color of the previous one. Wait, but that's for a path, not a cycle.

Wait, perhaps the number of colorings is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that would be 32 - 2=30, which is option C.

Alternatively, I've heard that the number for a cycle is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). Let me see for small n.

Wait, for a triangle (n=3), k=3: (2)^3 + (1)^3 *2=8+2=10. But wait, for a triangle, the number of colorings with 3 colors where adjacent are different. Each vertex must be different from the next. So for a triangle, the number of proper colorings is 3*(2)*(1) =6. Because the first can be any of 3, next 2, next 1. So 3*2*1=6. But according to the formula, it's (2)^3 + 2= 8+2=10. That's a discrepancy. So my formula must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k-1) * (k-2)^(n-1) for a cycle, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the number of colorings of a cycle is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). But when n=3, that gives (2)^3 + (1)^3 *2= 8+2=10, but the actual is 6. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula for a path and a cycle. For a path, the number of colorings where adjacent are different is k*(k-1)^(n-1). For a cycle, the formula is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=3, it's (2)^3 + (1)^3 *2=8+2=10. But when n=3 and k=3, the actual number is 3! =6. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k-1) * (k-2)^(n-1) + (-1)^n * (k-1). Let me try that. For n=3: (2)*(1)^2 + (1)*2 = 2 +2=4. Still not 6. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (k-1)*( (k-1)^(n-1) - (-1)^n ) ). Wait, for n=3, k=3: (2)*( (2)^2 - (1) )=2*(4-1)=2*3=6. That works for n=3. What about n=4, k=3: (2)* ( (2)^3 - (1) )= 2*(8-1)=14. Let me see if that's correct. For n=4, the number of colorings where adjacent are different and it's a cycle.

Possible colorings: fix the first vertex 1 color, next 2, next 3, but must not be same as previous and last must not be same as first. Let's enumerate for n=4, k=3:

First vertex: 3 options.

Second: 2 options.

Third: can't be same as second, so 2 options.

Fourth: can't be same as third and can't be same as first. Let's see. Suppose first is A, second B, third C, then fourth can't be C and can't be A. So options: 3-1 (C) and 3-1 (A) = 1 option? Wait, but A is the first, so if fourth is A, it's allowed. So fourth would have 2 options: B and C? Wait, no, if first is A, second is B, third is C, then fourth can be A or B.

Wait, for the first case, fourth is A: that's allowed. Second is B: not allowed because third is C, and fourth can't be C or A? Wait, no, the fourth has to be different from third and different from first. So for fourth, available colors are B and D? Wait, no, k=3.

Wait, let me think again. First is A. Second is B. Third is C. Fourth can't be C and can't be A. So the possible colors are B and D? But D is not an option. Oh, no, only 3 colors: A, B, C. So fourth can't be C and can't be A. So it must be B. So only 1 option. So for the first case, when first is A, second B, third C, fourth must be B.

Wait, but what about if the sequence is A, B, C, B? That's not allowed, because the last vertex B is adjacent to the first A, so that's okay. Oh, but in this case, after third is C, fourth is B, which is different from third (C) and different from first (A). So that's allowed. So how many sequences are there?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute using the formula. For n=4, the formula gives (2)*(8-1)=14. Let's see if that's correct. Let me count all possible colorings.

Alternatively, for n=4, the number of colorings is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1) = (2)^4 + (1)^4 *2 = 16 +2=18. But that's not 14. So my formula might be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the chromatic polynomial of a cycle. The chromatic polynomial for a cycle is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=3, that's 8 + 2=10, but the correct answer is 6. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the formula is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (k-1) * (k-2)^(n-1) + (-1)^n * (k-1). Wait, for n=3, that's (2) * (1)^2 + 1 * 2= 2+2=4, which is less than 6. So that's not right.

Hmm, maybe I should find another approach. Let's think about the problem again.

We have a cycle of 5 vertices. Each vertex must be colored with one of 3 colors, and adjacent ones must be different.

I recall that the number of colorings is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1) for a cycle. So for n=5, k=3: 2^5 + 2=34. But that's not an option. So perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: Let's use inclusion-exclusion. The total number of colorings where adjacent are different is equal to (k) * (k-1)^(n-1) for a path. But since it's a cycle, we have the additional constraint that the first and last are different. So the total is equal to (k-1)^(n) + (-1)^n (k-1). For n=5, that's 32 + 2=34. Which again isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, 32 + 2 = 34. But 34 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options: 60, 12, 30, 15, 36, 25, 50, 20, 24, 48. Hmm, 30 is an option. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1) only when n is even or something. Let's try for n=4, k=3: 2^4 + 1 *2=16+2=18. But earlier I thought for n=4, the actual count is 18. Wait, let me think again. Maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, for a cycle of 4, k=3. Let's list the colorings.

The number of proper colorings is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1) = 16 + 2=18. So that's correct.

But in the options, 30 is an option (option C). So perhaps for n=5, the formula gives 34, but none of the options match. Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (k-1)*(k-2)^(n-1) + (-1)^n * (k-1). For n=5, k=3: (2)*(1)^4 + (1)*2=2+2=4. Not matching.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the number of colorings is (k-1)^(n-1) * (k-2) + (k-1). For n=5, that's 4*2 +2= 10 +2=12. Hmm, 12 is option B. But when n=3, that would be 2*1 +2=4, but the correct is 6. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the formula is (k-1) * ((k-2)^(n-1) + (-1)^n). For n=5, k=3: 2*(1^4 +1)= 2*(1+1)=4. Not matching.

Another approach: I remember that for a cycle graph Cn, the chromatic polynomial is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that gives 32 + 2=34. But since the options don't have 34, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is (k-1)^n - (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that's 32 - 2=30. Option C is 30. So perhaps that's the correct formula.

But wait, why would the formula be (k-1)^n - (-1)^n (k-1)? For n=3, that would be 8 -2=6, which matches. For n=4, 16- (1)*2=14. But earlier I thought for n=4, k=3, the correct number is 18. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation when I thought for n=4, k=3, it's 18. Let me recount.

For a cycle of 4, k=3. The number of colorings is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1) = 2^4 + 2=18. But according to this formula, (2)^4 - 2=14. So discrepancy.

Hmm, maybe the formula is (k-1)^(n-1) * (k-2) + (k-1). For n=5, that's 4*2 + 2= 10 +2=12. Option B is 12. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the chromatic polynomial differently. For a cycle, the chromatic polynomial is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that's 32 +2=34. Since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is (k-1) * (k-2)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1). For n=5, that's 2 * 1^4 + 2=2 +2=4, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's model the problem as a recurrence relation.

For a cycle, the number of colorings is (k-1)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1). But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of derangements. But that's probably not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (k-1)^(n) - (k-1) * (-1)^n. Let me compute that for n=5, k=3: 32 - 2=30. That matches option C.

So, for a cycle, the number of colorings is (k-1)^n - (k-1)*(-1)^n.

Wait, let me check for n=3, k=3: 8 -2=6, which is correct.

n=4, k=3: 16 -2=14. But wait earlier I thought for n=4, the correct count is 18. So that suggests that my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula (k-1)^(n) + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=4, that's 16 + 2=18. Which matches the earlier calculation.

Wait, so for n=5, k=3: 32 + 2=34. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct formula is (k-1)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1) - something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the chromatic polynomial for a cycle is (k-1)^(n) + (-1)^n (k-1) + something else. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the number of colorings for a cycle as (k-1)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1). For n=5, that's 4*2 + 2=8+2=10. That's not matching any option either.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of permutations. For a cycle, each vertex is connected to two others, so it's a circular arrangement. So the number of colorings is (k-1) * (k-2)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the number of proper colorings of a cycle graph Cn: (k-1)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that's 4*2 + 2= 10, but again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a cycle, the number of colorings is (k-1) * (k-2)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1). For n=5, that gives 4*2 +2= 10. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula from the chromatic polynomial. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that's 32 +2=34. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct formula is (k-1)^(n) - (k-1) * (-1)^n.

Wait, for n=5: 32 - 2=30. Option C is 30.

But as I calculated earlier, for n=4, k=3, that would give 16 - 2=14, but earlier I thought it's 18. So that's a discrepancy.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find the correct formula through another approach.

Wait, I just found a resource that states the number of colorings for a cycle graph Cn is (k-1)^(n) + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that's 32 + 2=34. But 34 is not an option here.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate for n=4, k=3.

The number of colorings for a cycle of 4, k=3. Let's compute it step by step.

First vertex: 3 options.

Second vertex: 2 options (different from first).

Third vertex: 2 options (different from second), but also, since it's a cycle, it's adjacent to the first vertex. So the third vertex can't be the same as the first.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The third vertex is adjacent to the second and the fourth. So the third vertex can be the same as the first, as long as it's different from the second.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's model it.

First vertex: 3.

Second: 2 (different from first).

Third: can't be same as second. So 2 options. But also, it can't be same as first. Because it's a cycle. So let's see: for example, if first is A, second is B, third can't be B or A. So if first is A, third can be C or D (but k=3, so only C).

Wait, no, k=3, so only 3 colors. So third can't be same as second (B) or same as first (A). So third has only 1 option (C). So for each path, the third is determined.

Fourth vertex: can't be same as third (C) and can't be same as first (A). So options: B and C. But wait, can't be same as first (A) or third (C). So only B is allowed.

So for the first sequence, A, B, C, B.

Is that a valid coloring? Yes. Because A is different from B, B different from C, C different from B, and B different from A.

So that's one coloring.

But what about another sequence? Let's try A, B, C, A. Wait, but then the fourth vertex is A, which is different from third (C) and different from first (A)? No, because adjacent to first (A) is the fourth vertex. So if the fourth is A, that's same as first, which is allowed in a cycle. So that's another valid coloring.

Wait, but then for the first vertex A, the second B, third C, fourth A: that's a valid coloring.

So for this path, we have two colorings: A,B,C,B and A,B,C,A.

But wait, are there more? Let's think of another starting point.

Wait, perhaps the number of colorings is 2 for each path. But how does that align with the formula I'm using?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should try to find the correct formula again.

According to some sources, the chromatic polynomial for a cycle graph Cn is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, k=3: 32 +2=34. But that's not an option.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is (k-1)^(n) + (-1)^n (k-1). So for n=5, that gives 34.

But the options include 30, which is option C. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k-1)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1). For n=5, that's 4*2 +2= 10. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (k-1)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1). For n=4, that gives 3*2 +2= 8, which is not 18.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a recurrence and find the number of colorings.

We can think of the cycle as a line with the first and last vertices connected. So the number of colorings is the number of colorings for a line where the first and last are different.

The number of colorings for a line where adjacent are different is k*(k-1)^(n-1). But since the first and last are connected, we need to subtract the cases where they are the same.

So the number of colorings is k*(k-1)^(n-1) - (k-1) * (k-2)^(n-2).

Wait, let's test that with n=3, k=3.

k=3, n=3.

Number of colorings =3*(2)^2 - 2*(1)^1=3*4 -2*1=12-2=10. But the correct answer is 6.

So that's not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is k*(k-1)^(n-1) - (k-1)*(k-2)^(n-2). For n=5, k=3:

3*2^4 - 2*1^3=3*16 -2=48-2=46. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Let's consider each vertex and the possible choices.

The first vertex can be colored in 3 ways.

The second vertex can be colored in 2 ways (different from the first).

The third vertex can be colored in 2 ways (different from the second).

The fourth vertex can be colored in 2 ways (different from the third).

The fifth vertex must be colored in a way that it's different from the fourth and different from the first.

So, let's model this step by step.

For each possible sequence of the first four vertices, the fifth vertex has certain options.

Let's compute the number of possible sequences for the first four vertices.

Each vertex after the first must be different from the previous one.

So, the number of sequences for the first four vertices is:

3 (for the first) * 2 * 2 * 2 =24.

Wait, but wait: the second vertex can be same as the first? No, wait, no, because adjacent vertices must be different. So the second vertex must be different from the first. So the second vertex has 2 options.

Similarly, the third has 2 options, different from the second. The fourth has 2 options, different from the third.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the third vertex must be different from the second. So the third has 2 options. The fourth must be different from the third, so 2 options. So the number of sequences is 3 *2 *2 *2=24.

So, 24 possible sequences for the first four vertices.

Now, for each of these sequences, the fifth vertex must be colored in a way that it's different from the fourth and different from the first.

So for each sequence of four vertices, how many valid colors are there for the fifth vertex?

Let's consider the four vertices as A, B, C, D.

The fifth vertex must be different from D and A.

So, the number of choices for the fifth vertex depends on how many colors are available that are not D and not A.

Since there are 3 colors in total, the number of available colors for the fifth vertex is (3 - 2) =1, provided that D and A are different colors. If D and A are the same color, then the number of available colors is 2.

Wait, but in the sequences of four vertices, the first and fourth are connected. So in the fifth vertex, we have to ensure that it's different from the fourth (D) and the first (A). So if A and D are the same color, then the fifth vertex has 2 available colors. Otherwise, it has 1.

Wait, but is that the case? Let's think.

In the four-vertex sequence A, B, C, D, the fifth vertex must be different from D and from A.

So, if D and A are the same color, then the fifth vertex has 2 choices. If they are different, then the fifth vertex has 1 choice.

So, how many sequences have D and A the same color?

In the first vertex, A can be any of the 3 colors. The fourth vertex, D, can be any of the 3 colors. For the fifth vertex, to have D and A the same color, A must be equal to D. So A is fixed as D.

Wait, but in the four-vertex sequence, the first is A, the fourth is D. So when A equals D, the fifth vertex must be different from D (which is same as A) and different from A.

So the fifth vertex must be different from D (same as A) and different from A. So the number of available colors is 1.

In all other cases, where A != D, the fifth vertex must be different from D and A, so only 1 available color.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, suppose A and D are the same color. Then, the fifth vertex must be different from A and D, but since they are the same color, it can't be that color. So the fifth vertex must be different from that color. So there are 2 available colors.

Wait, but in the four-vertex sequence, the first vertex is A, and the fourth is D. If D and A are the same color, then in the fifth vertex, it can't be that color. So only 2 colors are available.

So, the number of sequences where A and D are the same color is when A equals D. So how many such sequences are there?

In the four-vertex sequence, the first is A, the fourth is D. So for the fifth vertex to have 2 choices, we need that A equals D.

In the four-vertex sequences, each sequence is determined by the first three vertices, as the fourth is determined by the third.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Let me think: For each four-vertex sequence, the number of possible fifth vertices depends on whether A and D are the same.

If A and D are same, 2 choices.

Else, 1 choice.

So, the number of four-vertex sequences where A and D are same is equal to the number of four-vertex sequences where the first and fourth vertices are same.

Which is equal to the number of four-vertex sequences where the first and fourth are same, which is equal to the number of possible colorings where the first and fourth are same.

So, the number of such four-vertex sequences is:

For the first vertex, choose any color (3 choices).

Second vertex: 2 choices (different from first).

Third vertex: 2 choices (different from second).

Fourth vertex: must be same as first.

So, for each first vertex (3 choices), second (2), third (2), fourth is fixed as first. So 3 *2 *2 *1= 12 sequences.

So, 12 four-vertex sequences where A and D are same.

For each of these, fifth vertex has 2 choices.

For the remaining four-vertex sequences, where A != D, the fifth vertex has 1 choice.

Total four-vertex sequences: 24.

Number of sequences where A == D:12.

Number of sequences where A != D:12.

Wait, but this seems off because for each four-vertex sequence, the fourth vertex is determined by the third.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express this.

Wait, the four-vertex sequences are determined by the first three vertices. The fourth is determined by the third.

So, for the first three vertices, the fourth is fixed.

So, the number of four-vertex sequences is 3 * 2 * 2=12. Because the first vertex has 3 options, the second 2, the third 2, so the fourth is fixed.

Wait, no: the first three can be any of 3*2*2=12 possibilities, and the fourth is fixed by the third.

So, the number of four-vertex sequences is 12.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 24. That's a mistake.

So, the number of four-vertex sequences is 12.

So, for each of these 12 sequences, the fifth vertex has either 1 or 2 choices.

Number of sequences where A == D: for the first and fourth to be same, the first must equal the fourth.

But the first is A, and the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the first is A, the third is B, then the fourth is B (different from third). But for the fifth vertex to be same as A, the fifth must be same as A, but the fourth is B. So, if A=B, then the fifth can be same as A or different.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of four-vertex sequences where A == D.

In such cases, the fifth vertex has 2 choices.

In the remaining sequences, the fifth vertex has 1 choice.

So, let's compute how many four-vertex sequences have A == D.

In four-vertex sequences, first is A, fourth is D.

A == D if and only if the first four vertices are such that the first and fourth are same.

But the first and fourth are determined by the first and fourth vertices.

So, for the first four-vertex sequence, the first is A, the fourth is D. For A == D, we must have D = A.

In the four-vertex sequence, the first is A, the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the fourth vertex is same as the third.

So, for the fourth vertex to be same as A, the third must be same as A.

So, in the four-vertex sequence, the first is A, the third is A, and the fourth is A.

So, the four-vertex sequence is A, B, A, A.

Now, how many such sequences are there?

For each A (3 choices), B can be 2 choices (different from A), and the fourth is A.

So, 3 *2=6 sequences where A==D.

Each of these sequences has 6 four-vertex sequences where A==D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the number of four-vertex sequences is 12. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that.

Let me think again: four-vertex sequences are determined by the first three vertices, as the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the first three can be any of 3*2*2=12 possibilities.

So, the number of four-vertex sequences is 12.

Out of these, how many have A == D?

In the four-vertex sequence, A is the first, D is the fourth.

So, for A == D, the first and fourth must be the same.

In the four-vertex sequence, the first is A, the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the fourth is same as the third.

So, for A == D, the first must be same as the third.

So, in the four-vertex sequence, the first is A, the third is A, and the fourth is A.

So, the four-vertex sequence is A, B, A, A.

So, how many such sequences are there?

A can be any of 3 colors, B can be any of 2 colors (different from A).

So, 3 *2=6 sequences where A==D.

Therefore, of the 12 four-vertex sequences, 6 have A==D, and the remaining 6 have A != D.

So, for each four-vertex sequence:

If A==D: fifth vertex has 2 choices.

If A != D: fifth vertex has 1 choice.

So, the total number of colorings is:

(6 sequences where A==D) * 2 choices + (6 sequences where A != D) *1 choice.

So, 6*2=12, 6*1=6. Total of 12+6=18.

But wait, earlier, when I thought the number of four-vertex sequences is 24, that was incorrect. It's actually 12, because the fourth vertex is determined by the third.

So, the correct number is 18.

Hmm, but according to this calculation, the total number of colorings is 18.

But earlier, I thought the formula gives 30.

Wait, so which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate.

The number of four-vertex sequences is 12.

In each of these, when A == D, fifth vertex has 2 choices.

When A != D, fifth vertex has 1 choice.

So, the total colorings are:

(6 * 2) + (6 * 1) = 12 + 6 = 18.

So, 18 colorings.

But wait, the options given are:

A: 60

B: 12

C:30

D:8

Wait, but according to this, the answer is 18, which is not among the options.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the number of colorings is 18, but the options don't include 18. So, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I counted the four-vertex sequences.

Wait, let me re-examine.

The four-vertex sequences are determined by the first three, as the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the first vertex: 3 choices.

Second: 2 choices.

Third: 2 choices.

So, the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the four-vertex sequences are 3 *2 *2=12.

Of these, when A == D, so when the first and fourth are same.

Which requires that the fourth is same as the first, which in the four-vertex sequence, the fourth is determined by the third.

So, for the fourth to be same as the first, the third must be same as the first.

So, the four-vertex sequence is A, B, A, A.

So, how many such sequences are there?

A can be any of 3 colors, B can be any of 2 colors (different from A).

So, 3 *2=6.

So, 6 four-vertex sequences where A == D.

Each of these has 2 choices for the fifth vertex.

So, 6 *2=12.

The other 6 four-vertex sequences have A != D, so only 1 choice for the fifth vertex.

6 *1=6.

Total colorings:18.

Which is not in the options.

Hmm.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I computed the number of four-vertex sequences.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me consider the problem as a graph with 5 vertices, each connected in a cycle.

So, each vertex is connected to two others, in a circular manner.

Each vertex can be colored with 3 colors, and adjacent vertices must have different colors.

We need to count the number of valid colorings.

This is a standard graph coloring problem, but the graph is a cycle of 5 vertices.

So, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of colorings of a cycle graph.

The formula is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1).

So, for n=5, k=3: (3-1)^5 + (-1)^5 (3-1) =2^5 -1*2=32-2=30.

Which is option C.

But earlier, my calculation gave 18, which is not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the four-vertex sequences.

Wait, perhaps the number of four-vertex sequences is 12, but when A == D, it's not 6, but 12.

Wait, no, no. Because the four-vertex sequences are determined by the first three vertices. The fourth is determined by the third.

So, the first three can be any of 3 *2 *2=12 possibilities.

So, the first three are A, B, C, and the fourth is C.

Wait, no, the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the fourth is same as the third.

Wait, earlier, I thought the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the four-vertex sequence is A, B, C, C.

So, in this case, when A == D, which is A == C, then it's a four-vertex sequence where the third is same as the first.

So, the four-vertex sequences where A == D are the ones where the third is same as the first.

So, the number of such sequences is 3 choices for A, 2 choices for B, and then the third is same as A, so the fourth is same as A.

So, 3*2=6 sequences.

Each of these has 2 choices for the fifth vertex.

The other sequences have 1 choice.

So, 6*2=12, 6*1=6. Total 18.

So, this approach leads to 18.

But according to the formula, it's 30.

Hmm.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the four-vertex sequences.

Wait, perhaps the four-vertex sequences are more than 12.

Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, the four-vertex sequences are determined by the first three vertices, as the fourth is determined by the third.

So, the first three can be any of 3 *2 *2=12 possibilities.

So, the first three are A, B, C, and the fourth is C.

Wait, no, the fourth is determined by the third. So, in the four-vertex sequence, the fourth is C.

Wait, no, wait. If the first three are A, B, C, then the fourth is determined by the third, which is C. So, the fourth is C.

So, the four-vertex sequences are A, B, C, C.

So, the number of four-vertex sequences is 12.

So, the earlier calculation holds.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k-1)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1).

Wait, for n=5, k=3: (2)^(4) + (-1)^5 (2) =16 -2=14.

Not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k-1)^(n) + (-1)^n (k-1).

So, for n=5, k=3: 2^5 + (-1)^5 *2=32 -2=30.

Which matches option C.

Hmm.

So, perhaps the formula is (k-1)^n + (-1)^n (k-1).

Wait, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (k-1) * (k-2)^(n-1) + (-1)^n (k-1).

But that seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps the formula is as follows: For a cycle graph Cn, the chromatic polynomial is (x-1)^n + (-1)^n (x-1).

So, for n=5, x=3: (3-1)^5 + (-1)^5 (3-1)=2^5 -2=32-2=30.

Which is option C.

But earlier, when I thought it was 18, perhaps that was incorrect.

So, perhaps the formula is correct, and the answer is 30.

Hmm.

So, perhaps I should proceed with the formula, and the answer is 30.

So, the correct answer is C:30.
</think>

The chromatic polynomial for a cycle graph \( C_n \) is given by:

\[
P(x) = (x - 1)^n + (-1)^n (x - 1)
\]

For \( n = 5 \) and \( x = 3 \):

\[
P(3) = (3 - 1)^5 + (-1)^5 (3 - 1) = 2^5 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of colorings is 30.

ANSWER: C:30
