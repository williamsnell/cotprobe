Question:

Two atoms of scandium are to combine with three atoms of oxygen. If you start with 1 gram of scandium, how much oxygen is required? Scandium has an atomic weight of 44.96 g/mole. The at. wt. of oxygen is 15.999 g/mole.

Options:

A: 0.400 g of oxygen
B: 0.800 g of oxygen
C: .444 g of oxygen
D: .623 g of oxygen
E: 0.711 g of oxygen
F: 0.360 g of oxygen
G: 0.250 g of oxygen
H: 0.675 g of oxygen
I: .290 g of oxygen
J: .533 g of oxygen

Okay, I need to figure out how much oxygen is required when two scandium atoms combine with three oxygen atoms. But wait, the question gives me grams of scandium and asks for grams of oxygen. Hmm, I think I should start by figuring out the moles of scandium from the given grams, then determine the moles of oxygen needed based on the stoichiometry, and finally convert moles of oxygen to grams.

Scandium's atomic weight is 44.96 g/mol. The problem says two atoms of scandium combine with three atoms of oxygen. Wait, that's a mole ratio? So, for every 2 moles of scandium, I need 3 moles of oxygen. So the ratio is 2:3 Sc : O.

First, let me find out how many moles of scandium are in 1 gram. Moles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol). So 1 g / 44.96 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

1 divided by 44.96 is approximately 0.02225 moles of Sc. Wait, let me do that more accurately. 1 / 44.96 is about 0.02225 mol.

But wait, the reaction uses two atoms of Sc, so it's actually two moles per mole of Sc. So the stoichiometry is 2 moles Sc : 3 moles O.

So for 0.02225 moles of Sc, the required O is (3/2) * 0.02225 mol. Let me compute that.

3/2 is 1.5. So 1.5 * 0.02225 is 0.033375 moles of O.

Now, convert moles of O to grams. Molar mass of O is 15.999 g/mol. So 0.033375 mol * 15.999 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

0.033375 * 16 is approximately 0.534 g. But wait, 15.999 is almost 16, so 0.033375 * 16 is 0.534, but let me compute it more accurately.

0.033375 * 15.999 = let me compute 0.033375 * 16 is 0.534, but since it's 15.999, it's a tiny bit less. 16 - 0.001 is 15.999. So 0.033375 * 0.001 = 0.000033375. So 0.534 - 0.000033375 = 0.5339666 g. Approximately 0.534 grams of O.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the stoichiometry? Let me think again. Two atoms of Sc combine with three atoms of O. So the mole ratio is 2 mol Sc : 3 mol O. Which is the same as 1:1.5. So yes, the calculation should be right.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says two atoms of scandium combine with three atoms of oxygen. Oh, wait, that's a mole ratio of 2:3. So the amount of oxygen needed is 3/2 times the amount of scandium.

Wait, but if scandium is 1 gram, then moles Sc is 1/44.96 ≈ 0.02225 mol. Then for O, it's (3/2)*0.02225 = 0.033375 mol. Multiply by 15.999 gives about 0.5339666 g, which is approximately 0.534 g.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.533 g. So the answer would be J.

Wait but wait, another possibility: perhaps I should think about the formula as Sc₂O₃ or something? No, the question says two atoms of Sc combine with three O atoms, meaning 2:3 ratio. So that's correct. So the calculation should be correct.

To determine the amount of oxygen required when two scandium atoms combine with three oxygen atoms, we start by calculating the moles of scandium in 1 gram. The atomic weight of scandium is 44.96 g/mol, so:

\[
\text{Moles of Sc} = \frac{\text{Mass of Sc}}{\text{Molar mass of Sc}} = \frac{1 \, \text{g}}{44.96 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.02225 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The stoichiometric ratio of scandium to oxygen is 2:3 (2 moles of Sc to 3 moles of O). Therefore, the moles of oxygen required are:

\[
\text{Moles of O} = \frac{3}{2} \times \text{Moles of Sc} = \frac{3}{2} \times 0.02225 \, \text{mol} \approx 0.033375 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Next, convert the moles of oxygen to grams using its molar mass of 15.999 g/mol:

\[
\text{Mass of O} = \text{Moles of O} \times \text{Molar mass of O} = 0.033375 \, \text{mol} \times 15.999 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 0.533 \, \text{g}.
\]

Thus, the amount of oxygen required is approximately 0.533 grams. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 0.533 g of oxygen.**
