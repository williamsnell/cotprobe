Okay, so I have this question about how adding more lamps in parallel affects the current in the power source. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when you have resistors or lamps in parallel, their behavior is a bit different from series circuits. Let me think.

In a series circuit, the current is the same through all components because they're connected end to end. But in a parallel circuit, each component is connected across the same two points. That means the voltage across each lamp is the same, right? But what about the current? Oh right, in parallel, the current splits up and takes different paths.

Each lamp has its own current, which depends on its resistance. If you add more lamps in parallel, the total resistance decreases because the current has more paths to go through. Lower resistance means more current, because I = V/R. Since the voltage (V) remains the same across the parallel combination, more lamps would mean a higher current.

Wait, but the question is about the current in the power source. The power source's current is the same as the total current in the circuit. So if more lamps are added in parallel, the total current would increase. Because each lamp contributes a bit more, but the total adds up.

So the options are A through J. The question is, as more lamps are connected in parallel, what happens to the current? Looking at the options, A says it remains the same. That doesn't make sense because adding more lamps would mean more current. C says it's not affected. No, because it's dependent on the number of lamps. D says triples—no, depends on the resistance. I think more lamps would increase it, but the options don't have an option for it increasing; but wait, option H is 'increases'. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but the options are labeled with letters. Let me check the options again. The question says, options A to J. So the correct answer is H: increases. But wait, no—wait, the options are A to J, with H being 'increases'. So the answer is H.
