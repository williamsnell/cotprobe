Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest whole number that satisfies three conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first condition is that when the number is divided by 4, the remainder is 1. So mathematically, if I call the number x, then x ≡ 1 mod 4. That means x can be written as 4k + 1 for some integer k. For example, numbers would be 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, etc.

The second condition is that when x is divided by 3, the remainder is 1. So, x ≡ 1 mod 3. Similarly, x can be expressed as 3m + 1 for some integer m. Numbers here would be 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, etc.

The third condition is that when x is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. So, x ≡ 2 mod 5. This can be written as x = 5n + 2 for some integer n. Numbers in this case would be 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, etc.

Now, I need to find the smallest x that satisfies all three. Let's find the numbers that satisfy each condition and see where they overlap.

First, let's list numbers that satisfy x ≡ 1 mod 4: 1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61,65,69,73,77,81,85,89,93,97,101,105,109,113,117,121,125,129,133,137,141,145,149,153,157,161,165,169,173,177,181,185,189,193,197,201,205,209,213,217,221,225,229,233,237,241,245,249,253,257,261,265,269,273,277,281,285,289,293,297,301,305,309,313,317,321,325,329,333,337,341,345,349,353,357,361,365,369,373,377,381,385,389,393,397,401,405,409,413,417,421,425,429,433,437,441,445,449,453,457,461,465,469,473,477,481,485,489,493,497,501,505,509,513,517,521,525,529,533,537,541,545,549,553,557,561,565,569,573,577,581,585,589,593,597,601,605,609,613,617,621,625,629,633,637,641,645,649,653,657,661,665,669,673,677,681,685,689,693,697,701,705,709,713,717,721,725,729,733,737,741,745,749,753,757,761,765,769,773,777,781,785,789,793,797,801,805,809,813,817,821,825,829,833,837,841,845,849,853,857,861,865,869,873,877,881,885,889,893,897,901,905,909,913,917,921,925,929,933,937,941,945,949,953,957,961,965,969,973,977,981,985,989,993,1000. Wait, but this list goes up to 1000, which is way too big. There's a smarter way.

Instead of listing every number, perhaps I can find a pattern or use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let me see.

We have x ≡ 1 mod 4 and x ≡ 1 mod 3. Let me find the common solutions to these two congruences.

x ≡ 1 mod 4 means x can be written as 4a + 1.

x ≡ 1 mod 3 means x can be written as 3b + 1.

So, 4a +1 = 3b +1 → 4a = 3b → 4a must be a multiple of 3. Since 4 and 3 are coprime, a must be a multiple of 3. So let a = 3k. Then x = 4*(3k) +1 = 12k +1.

So the numbers that satisfy both the first two conditions are numbers of the form 12k +1.

Now, we have the third condition: x ≡ 2 mod 5. So, 12k +1 ≡ 2 mod 5.

Let's solve for k. 12k ≡ 1 mod 5. Since 12 mod 5 is 2, this becomes 2k ≡1 mod5.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod5. The inverse of 2 is 3 because 2*3=6≡1 mod5. So, k ≡3*1 ≡3 mod5. That means k can be written as 5m +3 for some integer m.

So, substituting back into x=12k+1, we get x=12*(5m+3) +1 =60m +36 +1=60m +37.

So, the general solution is x=60m +37, where m is an integer.

Now, we need the smallest such x, so m=0 gives x=37. But wait, let me check if 37 satisfies all three conditions.

Check division by 4: 37 ÷4 is 9 with remainder 1. Yes, good.

Division by 3: 37 ÷3 is 12 with remainder 1. Correct.

Division by 5: 37 ÷5 is 7 with remainder 2. Perfect.

Wait, but looking at the options given, option E is 57, option D is 64, etc. So 37 is smaller than all of them. But wait, option E is 57, which is 57. Let me see if 37 is in the options. Checking the options:

E is 57, which is larger than 37. So 37 is the smallest. But wait, is 37 one of the options? Looking back, the options are:

A:72, B:76, C:67, D:64, E:57, F:45, G:43, H:55, I:81, J:37.

Yes, option J is 37. So, 37 is the answer. But wait, wait. Let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, according to the steps I took, x=60m +37. So for m=0, x=37. Is that the smallest?

Yes, because m has to be an integer, and m=0 gives the smallest x. So the answer should be 37, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the initial list I made for x ≡1 mod4 was up to 1000, which is way too big, but 37 is much smaller than all the options presented. So, it's correct. But let me see if 37 is indeed correct.

Wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me list the numbers that satisfy x ≡1 mod4 and x≡1 mod3, which are 12k+1. So numbers include 1,13,25,37,49,61,73,85,97,109,121,133,145,157,169,181,193,205,217,229,241,253,265,277,289,301,313,325,337,349,361,373,385,397,409,421,433,445,457,469,481,493,505,517,529,541,553,565,577,589,601,613,625,637,649,661,673,685,697,709,721,733,745,757,769,781,793,805,817,829,841,853,865,877,889,901,913,925,937,949,961,973,985,997,1009.

Now, from this list, which is the first number that also leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5?

Let's check each:

1: 1 ÷5 → remainder 1 → no.

13: 13 ÷5 → 2 rem 3 → no.

25: 25 ÷5 → rem 0 → no.

37: 37 ÷5 → 7*5=35, 37-35=2 → yes. So 37 is the first in this list that meets all conditions.

Therefore, 37 is the smallest number, which is option J.

Wait, but wait, the options include 72,76, etc., but 37 is smaller. So the correct answer is option J:37.

The smallest number that satisfies all three conditions is 37, which is option J.
