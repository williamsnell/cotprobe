Okay, I need to solve this related rates problem about water dripping out of a cone. Let me think through the steps.

So the problem says that water is dripping out from a hole at the vertex of an upside-down cone. The volume of the cone is given by V = (1/3)πr²h. The given dimensions are height h = 2 cm and radius r = 1 cm. The water is dripping at a rate of 3 cm³ per minute. We need to find the rate at which the height of the water is changing when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone. The options are all negative fractions, so we're looking for a rate of change that's negative, which makes sense because the volume is decreasing.

Wait, but I should clarify: upside-down cone? That's a cone pointing downward. But the water is draining out, so the water level is rising as it drains. Wait, no, because the hole is at the vertex (which is the point at the bottom of the upside-down cone). Oh, wait! If the cone is upside-down, its vertex is the bottom, and the water is rising towards the vertex. Wait, no, the question says the water is dripping out of the vertex. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read again.

The problem says: "Water drips out of a hole at the vertex of an upside-down cone at a rate of 3 cm³ per minute." So the vertex is the bottom of the cone, since it's upside-down. So the water is coming out from the bottom. So the height of the water is increasing as it flows out. But wait, if it's an upside-down cone, the water level would be rising towards the top, but the vertex is the bottom.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's draw a mental picture: a cone that's upside down, so the tip is at the bottom. The water is filling up from the tip? Or is it draining from the tip? No, wait, the water is dripping out of the vertex, which is the tip of the upside-down cone. So as time passes, water is leaving from the tip, causing the water level to rise (since the cone is upside-down, the water would be filling up from the tip). Wait, that's getting more confusing. Maybe I should approach this with calculus.

I think the key here is to model the volume of water in the cone as a function of time and then take the derivative. Let's denote V as the volume, h as the height of the water, and r as the radius at height h.

Since the cone is similar to the original cone, the ratio of radius to height remains constant. The original cone has height H = 2 cm and radius R = 1 cm. So r/R = h/H, which would give r = (R/H) h = (1/2) h. Because for the original cone, r/R = h/H → r = (1/2) h.

So, the radius of the water's surface at height h is half the height. Therefore, the volume of the water at height h is V = (1/3) π r² h = (1/3) π ( (1/2 h ) )² h = (1/3) π ( (1/4) h² ) h = (1/3) π (1/4) h³ = (π/12) h³.

But wait, no, because the water is spilling out of the vertex. Wait, no, the volume of the water that's in the cone is increasing as the water level rises. Wait, no, because the cone is upside-down, so the water is actually filling up from the vertex. Let me think again. Wait, no, when the cone is upside-down, the water would be filling from the tip (the vertex) upwards. So the volume of water is increasing as h increases. But the problem states that water is dripping out, so perhaps the water is being poured into the upside-down cone, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the cone is filled with water and then the vertex is removed, allowing water to flow out.

Wait, perhaps this is a classic related rates problem where the volume is decreasing as the water flows out. Wait, the water is dripping out, so the volume is decreasing. So the problem states that the volume is decreasing at 3 cm³ per minute. So dV/dt = -3 cm³/min. We need to find dh/dt when the height is h = 2 cm - 0.5 cm = 1.5 cm.

Wait, but wait, the question says: "At what rate does the height of the water change when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone?" So the top of the cone is at 2 cm, so the current height is 1.5 cm.

Wait, but let's make sure about the setup. Since the water is flowing out through the vertex, which is the tip. So as time passes, water is leaving the tip, so the height of the water (from the tip) is increasing. Therefore, the volume is increasing as h increases. Wait, that can't be because the water is dripping out. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the cone is full, and the water is spilling out from the vertex. So the height of the water is measured from the vertex—so when the vertex is the bottom, the water height h is the depth of the water from the vertex (the bottom). As the water flows out, h increases (as the water level rises towards the top of the cone). But since the cone is upside-down, the water is filling from the vertex (the bottom) upward. So the volume of water is increasing as h increases. But the problem says the water is dripping out, which would mean dV/dt is negative. So this seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the height from the vertex being the top, like a normal cone. But the question says it's an upside-down cone. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the setup is the cone is upside-down, so the vertex is the bottom. The water is filling up from the vertex, meaning that as time goes on, the water level (h) increases. However, the problem states that water is dripping out, which would mean that the volume is decreasing. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if water is filling from the vertex, then the volume should be increasing as h increases. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the water is being poured out of the cone, which is upside-down, so the water is draining from the top. So the water's surface is at the top of the cone, and as time passes, the volume decreases because the water is leaving the cone. Wait, that makes more sense. So the volume is decreasing because the water is draining out, so dV/dt is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly. Let me think: the cone is upside-down, so its point (vertex) is at the bottom. The water is filling up from the vertex, but the question says it's dripping out of the vertex. So the water is leaving the vertex, causing the water level to rise. So the height of the water would be increasing as time passes.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that the cone is full, and the water is spilling out from the vertex. So the height of the water (from the vertex) is h, and as time progresses, h increases. The volume is increasing, so dV/dt would be positive. But the problem states that the water is dripping out at 3 cm³ per minute, implying dV/dt is negative. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the water is being poured into the upside-down cone, and the cone's vertex is at the top. No, the question says the cone is upside-down, so the vertex is at the bottom. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. Let me clarify.

Let me approach this step by step.

1. Understand the setup: upside-down cone. So, the cone is pointing downward, with its tip at the bottom. The water is draining from this cone, which is at the bottom. So as the water flows out, the height of the water in the cone increases. So the volume of water in the cone is increasing as h increases. But the problem says the volume is decreasing because water is dripping out. Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine. The problem states: "water drips out of a hole at the vertex of an upside-down cone at a rate of 3 cm³ per minute." So the hole is at the vertex, which is the bottom of the cone. So if the cone is upside-down, the vertex is at the bottom. So when water flows out through the vertex, the height of the water in the cone (from the vertex) is increasing. So, the volume of water in the cone is increasing as the water level rises. But the problem says that the volume is decreasing, which doesn't make sense because water is flowing out. So perhaps I've misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps the cone is being filled with water and then the vertex is removed, allowing water to flow out. Let me read again: "water drips out of a hole at the vertex of an upside-down cone at a rate of 3 cm³ per minute." So the vertex is the bottom, and water is leaving the vertex. So the water is filling up from the vertex (the bottom), so the height of the water increases, meaning the volume increases. But the problem says the volume is decreasing, which can't be. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup or my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the cone is upside-down, so the water is filling from the top, but that's not how cones work. Let me think again. I'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as follows: The volume is decreasing as the water flows out, so dV/dt is negative. The water is draining from the vertex, so the height of the water (from the vertex) is increasing. So the volume is increasing with time, which would mean dV/dt is positive. But the problem states that the volume is decreasing at 3 cm³ per minute. So perhaps the problem is that the water is being poured into the cone, and the cone is upside-down, so the water level is rising. But the problem says it's dripping out, which is confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the cone is being filled with water, and then the vertex is removed, causing water to flow out. So the volume of the cone is fixed, and the hole at the vertex allows water to flow out. That's another scenario. But the problem says the water is dripping out of the vertex, which is the bottom of the cone. So as the water flows out, the height of the water in the cone (from the vertex) increases, and the volume increases. But the problem says the volume is decreasing. So I'm stuck because that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the given problem, assuming that the volume is decreasing as the water flows out. That would imply that dV/dt is negative. So, with that, let's model it.

So, the volume of the cone is V = (1/3)π r² h. But since the cone is similar to itself, the ratio of r to h is constant. The original cone has r = 1 cm and h = 2 cm, so r = (1/2) h. So, r = (1/2) h.

Therefore, the volume as a function of h is V = (1/3) π ( (1/2 h ) )² h = (1/3) π ( (1/4 h²) ) h ) = (1/3) π (1/4 h³ ) = π/12 h³.

Wait, but the cone is upside-down, so the water is filling from the vertex (bottom) upwards. So if the height h is measured from the vertex, then as water flows out, h increases, and the volume increases. But the problem says the volume is decreasing. So perhaps the setup is the opposite: the volume is decreasing as the water level decreases. Wait, that might be it. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the cone has a fixed volume, and water is being poured out (drain) from the vertex. But the volume of the water in the cone is decreasing as h decreases. So, if the volume is V = (1/3) π r² h, and since r = (1/2) h, substituting gives V = (1/3) π ( (1/2 h )² ) h = π/12 h^3. But if the volume is decreasing as h decreases, then perhaps the volume is being poured in, and then the hole causes it to drain, but perhaps the height is measured from the vertex as decreasing. Alternatively, perhaps the height h is measured from the vertex, but the volume is decreasing when the water level is decreasing.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the given information, assuming that the volume is decreasing at 3 cm³ per minute, and that the height is 1.5 cm (since the water level is half a cm below the top of the cone, which is 2 cm, so 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 cm).

So, the volume V is a function of h. V = (1/3) π r² h. Since the cones are similar, as the height increases, the radius increases proportionally.

Wait, if the original cone has height H = 2 cm and radius R =1 cm, then for any height h, the radius r is (R/H) h = (1/2) h. So, r = h/2.

So, V = (1/3) π (h/2)^2 h = (1/3) π (h²/4) h = (1/3) π (h³/4) = π h³ /12.

But since the problem states that water is spilling out, the volume is decreasing. Wait, but if the height is increasing, then the volume is increasing. So perhaps the volume is V = (π/3) r² h, but because the cone is upside-down, the water is filling from the vertex (bottom), so h increases as the water level rises. If the volume is decreasing, that would mean that the water is draining from the vertex, which isn't the case here. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended that the volume is increasing as h increases, but the question says it's decreasing. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the cone is being filled, and then the water level decreases as the hole allows it to drain. But I think the problem states that the water is dripping out, so the volume is decreasing. So let me proceed with the assumption that dV/dt is negative.

Wait, but in that case, if volume is decreasing, then dV/dt is negative, and the height is increasing. So let's proceed.

We can model the problem as follows: The volume of water in the cone is V = (1/3) π r² h, but since the cone is similar to itself, r = (1/2) h. So V = (1/3) π ( (h/2)^2 ) h = (1/3) π (h^3 /4) ) = π h^3 /12. So, dV/dt = (π/12) * 3 h² dh/dt = (π/4) h² dh/dt.

Wait, but if the volume is decreasing, then dV/dt is negative. However, if the problem states that the volume is decreasing at 3 cm³ per minute, then dV/dt = -3 cm³/min.

Wait, but according to the earlier model, dV/dt = (π/4) h² dh/dt. If dV/dt is -3, then setting up the equation:

-3 = (π/4) h² (dh/dt)

We can solve for dh/dt.

First, let's note the height h at which we need to evaluate dh/dt. The water level is half a cm below the top of the cone. The top is at h = 2 cm, so h = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 cm.

So, plug in h = 1.5 cm.

Then,

-3 = (π/4) (1.5)^2 (dh/dt)
=> dh/dt = (-3 * 4) / (π * (1.5)^2)
= (-12) / (π * 2.25)
= (-12) / (2.25 π)
= (-12 * 4) / (9 π)
= (-48) / (9 π)
= (-16) / (3 π)

Wait, simplifying:

Denominator: 1.5 squared is 2.25, which is 9/4.

So 1.5^2 = (3/2)^2 = 9/4.

So,

dh/dt = (-3) * 4 / (π * (9/4))
Wait, no: Let me recalculate correctly.

Wait, correct approach:

-3 = ( (π/4) * (1.5)^2 ) * (dh/dt)

So,

dh/dt = (-3) / ( (π/4) * (2.25) )

= (-3) / ( (π * 2.25) / 4 )

= (-3 * 4 ) / (2.25 π )

= (-12) / (2.25 π )

Simplify 12 / 2.25:

2.25 is 9/4, so 12 / (9/4) = 12 * (4/9) = (48/9) = 16/3.

So,

dh/dt = (-12) / ( (9/4) π ) = (-12 * 4 ) / (9 π ) = (-48) / (9 π )

Simplify 48/9 to 16/3:

48/9 = 16/3.

So,

dh/dt = (-16) / (3 π )

Looking at the options:

Option G is −16/(3π) cm/min.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but earlier I thought the cone is upside-down, so the water's height from the vertex is h, which increases as the water flows out. But according to the problem, the volume is decreasing (dV/dt = -3), which would correspond to a negative dh/dt (since dh/dt is negative when volume is decreasing). So when calculating, I get dh/dt = (-16)/(3π), which matches option G.
</think>

The problem involves a cone that's upside-down, with water draining from the vertex. We are to find the rate at which the water level is changing.

### Key Steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The cone is upside-down, so water drains from the vertex (bottom).
   - The volume of water is decreasing at a rate of 3 cm³/min.
   - We need to find dh/dt when the water level is 1.5 cm from the top (h = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 cm).

2. **Volume as a Function of Height:**
   - The original cone has height H = 2 cm and radius R = 1 cm.
   - Similar cones have proportional dimensions: r = (R/H) h = (1/2) h.
   - Volume of the cone: \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^2 h = \frac{\pi}{12} h^3 \).

3. **Differentiate with Respect to Time:**
   - \( \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{12} \cdot 3 h^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{4} h^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \).

4. **Apply Given Values:**
   - \( \frac{dV}{dt} = -3 \) cm³/min (volume decreasing).
   - \( h = 1.5 \) cm.

5. **Solve for dh/dt:**
   \[
   -3 = \frac{\pi}{4} (1.5)^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{-3 \cdot 4}{\pi (1.5)^2} = \frac{-12}{\pi \cdot 2.25} = \frac{-12 \cdot 4}{9 \pi} = \frac{-16}{3 \pi}
   \]

6. **Match with Options:**
   The calculated dh/dt matches option G.
