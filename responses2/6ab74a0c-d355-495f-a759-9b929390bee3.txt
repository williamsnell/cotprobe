The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called "cardinals"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which topic Martin Luther avoided speaking about in his letter. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. The question is about identifying the topic he didn't address. 

Looking at the text: The letter talks about the reform of the Christian estate, the effort to protect themselves by putting boundaries around themselves, and mentions various roles and activities related to the church. It also discusses the role of the Pope and the creation of cardinals. 

The options are A to J. Let me go through each:

A: Wealth of the church. The letter doesn't mention wealth or how the church is managed. It talks about cardinals creating fiefs and convents.
B: Sale of indulgences. The text doesn't talk about selling indulgences or any financial aspects of the church.
C: Political nature of the church. The letter discusses the church's structure and its role but doesn't directly state it's political.
D: Role of the Pope. Yes, the letter explicitly mentions the Pope's role.
E: Creation of cardinals. Yes, the letter details how cardinals were created.
F: Power of the clergy. The letter doesn't talk about the power or hierarchy of the clergy.
G: Reformation of the Christian estate. The letter does discuss reform and the effort to reform the church.
H: Worldly pomp of the head of Christendom. The text discusses the head's position and why he's in a bad light, but doesn't directly state it.
I: Interpretation of scriptures by the Pope. The letter mentions the Pope's role in interpreting the scriptures.
J: Corruption within the church. The text doesn't address corruption; instead, it talks about the church's structure and its role in reform.

So, the options that are not mentioned are A, B, F, H, J. But the question is which one he avoided. Looking at the options, the letter doesn't mention any of these topics. Wait, let me check again: The letter doesn't talk about wealth, sale of indulgences, power of the clergy, or the role of the Pope beyond the cardinal creation. So, which of the options are not addressed?

Looking back, the options given are A to J. The letter doesn't mention wealth, indulgences, clergy's power, the Pope's role beyond being the interpretor, the cardinal's creation, or the head's worldly position. So the topics he avoided are A, B, F, H, J. But the options given are single letters, so which one is the answer? The question says, "which of the following topics did he avoid?" So I need to pick one. Let's see the options again.

Wait, the question says "avoided" among the topics listed. Let me go through each:

A: Wealth of the church. No, the letter doesn't talk about wealth or how the church is managed.
B: Sale of indulgences. No, it doesn't mention the sale.
F: Power of the clergy. No, it's more about the structure and hierarchy.
J: Worldly pomp of the head. The letter discusses it, but in the context of the overall message, not the specific topic. Wait, the letter's focus is on reform, so maybe he didn't address the specific content of the service but the structure. Alternatively, perhaps he didn't address the sale of indulgences or the power aspect.

Wait, the letter mentions the creation of cardinals and their structures. So the topics he avoided are A, B, F, H, J.

Looking at the options, the question is which one he avoided. The options are A to J. Since the letter doesn't talk about any of these, but the options are single letters, perhaps the answer is B, F, or J?

Wait, the question is asking which topic he avoided. So in the options, the answer is the topic that's not mentioned. But the letter doesn't mention any of the options A to J except for some aspects.

Wait, the options are A to J, not including all possible topics. So the correct answer is the one he didn't address. Since the letter doesn't mention wealth, sale of indulgences, power of the clergy, role of the Pope, or the head's position, but the options are A to J, so the correct answer is the one he didn't mention. The letter doesn't address any of A to J except perhaps the role of the Pope in option D.

Wait, no, the letter does address the role of the Pope in option D. So the topics he avoided are A, B, F, H, J.

But the options are single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is B, F, or J. Wait, but the question is about the topics he avoided. The letter's content doesn't address any of them. So the correct answer would be the one he didn't address, which is any of A, B, F, H, or J. But the options are single letters, so perhaps the answer is B, F, or J.

Wait, but looking at the letter, the topics it discusses are about reform, structure, and the role of the Pope. So the answer should be the topic he didn't mention, which is one of A, B, F, H, or J. But the question is asking which one he avoided, not necessarily which he didn't mention at all.

Wait, maybe the answer is E: the creation of cardinals. No, the letter does discuss the creation of cardinals. So perhaps the answer is F: the power of the clergy. But the letter doesn't directly talk about the power of the clergy, but more about their structures. Hmm.

Wait, the options provided are A to J, and the letter doesn't mention any of them. So the correct answer is the one that's not mentioned. But all the options except G are not mentioned. Wait, no, the options are A to J, and I have to choose one.

Wait, perhaps I should read the question again. It's asking which topic he avoided. So looking for the option that is not discussed in the letter.

The letter is about reform, the structure of the church, the role of the Pope, etc. So the topics he didn't mention are the wealth (A), sale of indulgences (B), power of the clergy (F), role of the Pope (D), and the head's position (H, J). So he didn't address any of these options, but the question is which one he avoided. Since the options are single letters, perhaps the answer is B, F, or J. But the question says he avoided speaking about which of the following. So perhaps the answer is E: the role of the Pope. No, the letter mentions the role of the Pope in being the interpretor. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A: the wealth of the church, as he talks about the church's structure and not the wealth.

Wait, the letter doesn't mention wealth (A) or the sale of indulgences (B), so those are two topics he avoided. But the options are single letters. So the correct answer is either one. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: the sale of indulgences. The letter doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: the role of the Pope. Wait, the letter does talk about the role of the Pope in being the interpretor. So that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: the power of the clergy. Because the letter doesn't mention the power aspect. So I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think differently.

In the text, the letter talks about the reformation, the structures of the church, the role of the Pope, and the creation of cardinals. It doesn't mention anything about the wealth of the church, the sale of indulgences, the power of the clergy, the role of the Pope beyond just being the interpretor, or the head's position.

So the topics he avoided are A, B, F, H, J. The options are single letters, so perhaps the answer is B, F, or J. But since the question is about which he "avoided," and the options are single letters, perhaps the correct answer is B: the sale of indulgences.

Wait, no, the letter doesn't mention the sale of indulgences. It's more about the structures and the role of the Pope. So perhaps the correct answer is B because the letter doesn't address the sale of indulgences. Or perhaps it's A. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because the letter doesn't mention the sale of indulgences. Alternatively, maybe it's F: the power of the clergy. Because the letter doesn't discuss the power aspect of the clergy. But he does talk about structures and structures being crucial for the church's power, so maybe he didn't address the power aspect directly.

Wait, but the letter's focus is on reform, not on the specifics of the service. So perhaps the answer is the one he didn't mention, which is the power of the clergy. So option F.
</think>

The letter addresses several topics, but it does not discuss wealth of the church, the sale of indulgences, the power of the clergy, the role of the Pope, or the head's position. Since the question asks which topic he avoided, and the options are single letters, the best answer is F: the power of the clergy.

**Answer: F**
