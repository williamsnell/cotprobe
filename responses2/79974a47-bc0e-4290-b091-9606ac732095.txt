Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about whether decimal numbers have an exact binary representation. The options are A through H, each with a different decimal number. I remember that not all decimal fractions can be represented exactly in binary. Hmm, let's think about this.

First, I recall that in binary, each digit represents a power of two. So, for example, the first digit after the decimal point is 2^-1 (which is 1/2), the next is 2^-2 (1/4), then 2^-3 (1/8), and so on. So any number that can be expressed as a finite sum of these fractions will have an exact binary representation.

So, let's look at each option:

A: 0.8. Let's see, 0.8 is 4/5. Wait, can 5 be a power of 2? No, because 5 is 2^2 + 1. So 5 isn't a power of two. That means 0.8 in binary won't terminate. So A probably doesn't have an exact representation.

B: 0.3. 0.3 is 3/10. But 10 is 2*5. Again, 5 is not a power of two, so 0.3 can't be represented exactly in binary. So B's probably not exact.

C: 0.9. 0.9 is 9/10. 9 is 3^2, and 10 is 2*5, same issue as before. So 0.9 can't be represented exactly.

D: 0.2. 0.2 is 1/5. 5 is not a power of two. So D's binary representation is repeating and can't be exact.

E: 0.1. Oh wait, I think 0.1 in binary is exact. Because 0.1 in decimal is 1/10. But wait, 10 is 2*5, and 5 isn't a power of two. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, 0.1 in binary is 0.0001100110011..., repeating every 4 digits? Or is it exact? Let me think again. Wait, no, 1/10 in binary is a repeating fraction. So 0.1 in binary is 0.0001100110011... which is an infinite expansion. So E isn't exact.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Oh wait, 0.1 in binary is 0.1, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.1 in decimal is 0.1, but in binary, 0.1 is 0.0001100110011..., which is a repeating fraction. So it's not exact. Hmm, so E is not exact.

F: 0.7. 0.7 is 7/10. Again, denominator has 5, which isn't a power of two. So it's a repeating fraction in binary. So F isn't exact.

G: 0.6. 0.6 is 3/5. Same problem as before; 5 isn't a power of two. So G isn't exact.

H: 0.5. Oh, 0.5 is 1/2, which is exactly 0.1 in binary. So H is exact.

I: 0.4. 0.4 is 2/5. Again, 5 is a factor that can't be expressed as a power of two. So 0.4 in binary is a repeating fraction. So I isn't exact.

Wait, but wait! I thought E was 0.1 in decimal, which is 0.000110011... in binary, which is an infinite string. So it's not exact. So the correct answer would be H.

The decimal number that has an exact representation in binary is 0.5, which is 0.1 in binary. 

Answer: H
