Alright, so I've got this question about the function of receptors in the retina and the cochlea. Let me try to think this through. Okay, I remember that the retina and the cochlea both receive different types of signals, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences.

The question is asking which functional difference exists between them. The options are A to J, each describing a different aspect. The options are about things like membrane properties, cell structure, ability to regenerate, speed, ions involved, etc.

First, I should probably think about what each part of the retina and cochlea do. The retina is in the eye and has photoreceptors, which detect light. These receptors are specialized cells, right? They're arranged in the retina, and each one is responsible for a specific part of the visual field. They're connected by axons, which means they can send signals to other parts of the brain, like the visual cortex.

The cochlea, on the other hand, is part of the inner ear. It has hair cells that are highly specialized. Hair cells are very small and are most sensitive to specific frequencies of sound. They convert sound vibrations into electrical signals, which the brain then interprets as sound frequencies.

Wait, so what's the question again? It's asking about functional differences. So, the options are what's most different between the two groups.

Looking at the options: 

A) Magnitude of resting potentials. Well, both have different kinds of ion channels, but I'm not sure if that's the main difference. Maybe the magnitude isn't the most significant feature.

B) Size and structure of their cells. Oh yeah, the cells themselves are different. The photoreceptors in the retina are larger and have more specialized structures, like photoreceptor cells (rods) and cone cells. The cochlea's hair cells are tiny, specialized structures that respond to specific frequencies.

C) Ability to regenerate after damage. Both can regenerate, but I'm not sure if that's a functional difference. Maybe it's more about their specific functions rather than their structure.

D) Speed of signal transmission. Both can transmit signals, but I think the speed is different. The retina's photoreceptors might send signals faster than the cochlea, but I'm not certain.

E) Number of axons each cell possesses. The retina has many more axons than the cochlea. The retina has thousands of axons, whereas the cochlea has just a few. So this is a significant difference.

F) Ions involved in action potentials. The cells in the retina might use different ions, like calcium (for photoreceptors) and sodium (for cone cells). The cochlea uses sodium and potassium ions for its action potentials.

G) Sensitivity to external stimuli. The retina is very sensitive to light, while the cochlea responds to sound. So their sensitivity would be different.

H) Refractory periods. Both have some period they can't fire again after, but the timing and duration might be different.

I) Synapse location. The retina's cells connect to the visual cortex, whereas the cochlea's hair cells connect to the brain's auditory processing areas.

J) Types of energy. The retina converts light energy to electrical signals, while the cochlea converts sound energy into electrical signals.

So which of these is the question about? The question is about the functional difference, not just the types of energy. 

Looking back, the options that describe structural differences are B, E, G, J. But the question is about "most" functional difference.

Wait, the question says "functionally, receptors... differ most from...". So the key functional difference is probably in their responses to stimuli and how they process information.

Photoreceptors in the retina are more sensitive to light changes (like color changes) and process higher frequencies. The cochlea responds to a broader range of frequencies but is more specialized for each.

Alternatively, the main difference might be in the types of ions involved. The retina uses ions like calcium, while the cochlea uses sodium and potassium. But that's a specific case, not the most general functional difference.

Another angle: the size and structure. The retina's receptors are larger and have more complex structures, whereas the cochlea's hair cells are tiny and specialized.

Wait, the options also include E: number of axons. The retina has thousands, the cochlea has a few. That's a major structural difference.

So the answer would be E: number of axons each cell possesses.

The question asks about the functional difference between receptors in the retina and the cochlea. Both groups process different types of stimuli, but the key structural difference lies in the number of axons each cell possesses. The retina's photoreceptors have thousands of axons, while the cochlea's hair cells have just a few. This difference is significant because it affects their ability to transmit signals and respond to stimuli in distinct ways.
