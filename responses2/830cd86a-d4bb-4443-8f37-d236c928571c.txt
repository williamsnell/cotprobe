Question:

What is the value of p in 24 = 2p?

Options:

B: p = 6
C: p = 14
D: p = 16
E: p = 8
F: p = 10
G: p = 18
H: p = 12
I: p = 20
J: p = 4

Alright, so I've got this equation here: 24 equals 2p. I'm trying to find the value of p. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

Okay, the equation is 24 = 2p. So, I need to solve for p. To isolate p, I should get rid of that coefficient of 2 in front of it. How do I do that? Oh right, I can divide both sides of the equation by 2. Let me write that down.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives me 24 divided by 2 equals p. Which is 12 equals p. So p is 12.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. If I plug p back into the original equation, does it make sense? Let's see. 2 times 12 is 24, right? Yes, 2 × 12 = 24. So that checks out.

Now, looking at the options provided, I need to match p to one of them. Let me check each option:

A: 24 → No, p is 24, but that's double what I got.
B: 6 → Too small, because 2×6 is 12, not 24.
C:14 → 2×14 is 28, nope.
D:16 → 2×16 is 32, nope.
E:8 → 2×8 is 16, no.
F:10 → 2×10 is 20, no.
G:18 → 2×18 is 36, nope.
H:12 → That's what I got, 2×12=24.
I:20 → 2×20=40, no.
J:4 → 2×4=8, nope.

So, the correct answer is H: p = 12.

The correct value of p is 12, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
