Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about production possibilities frontiers and some economic theories. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question asks which statements are positive. I remember that positive economics focuses on facts and logical reasoning rather than policy implications. So I need to find which of the given statements are correct and, more importantly, positive in nature.

Looking at the options:

A: The law of increasing costs leads to a downward sloping production possibilities frontier.
Hmm. I recall that the production possibilities frontier (PPF) shows the maximum output combinations of two goods an economy can produce when all resources are fully and efficiently utilized. The law of increasing costs is about the cost of producing more goods rising. So, when costs increase, it's likely that to produce more of one good, the economy needs to sacrifice some of another. This might cause the PPF to slope downward, but wait, the law of increasing costs is a reason why the PPF has a negative slope. So A is correct. It's a positive statement because it's a fact about how costs influence the shape of the PPF.

B: Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war.
This sounds like a policy or strategy, suggesting that focusing on consumer goods might be better. But I'm not sure if this is positive. Positive statements shouldn't be based on assumptions or policies. This is more like a recommendation or a statement that could be seen as negative if it's not beneficial. It might be a negative statement because it's not necessarily proven or based on facts.

C: The production possibilities frontier is linear due to constant costs.
Wait, the PPF being linear usually implies constant opportunity costs, which would be due to constant costs. But if costs are changing, the PPF might curve. So if costs are constant, the PPF is linear. So the statement says that the PPF is linear because of constant costs. That seems correct. So C is a positive statement.

D: The production possibilities frontier is convex to the origin because of the law of decreasing costs.
Convex shape for the PPF makes sense when there are decreasing opportunity costs. If production of one good becomes easier as you produce more of another, the PPF becomes flatter as you move along. The law of diminishing returns relates to decreasing marginal returns, which leads to decreasing opportunity costs. So this statement is correct. It's a positive statement.

E: An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter.
This is comparing two different production points. If butter is on the x-axis and guns on the y-axis, producing more butter (higher x) would be better. But this doesn't necessarily tell us about the economy's efficiency. It's a statement without any logical reasoning. It's more of a fact than an implication. So this is positive because it's a correct fact, but is it a statement that's logically derived? Or is it just a descriptive statement? Wait, the question is about positive statements, which are statements that can be logically deduced from facts. So E is a true statement but doesn't necessarily follow logically from any other principles. Hmm, not sure if it's positive or not.

Wait, let's think again. Positive statements are those that can be logically derived from the given premises. So, for example, if we know that the PPF is convex, then any statement about the economy's position relative to the PPF is positive. But E is just a general statement about comparative advantages. Without more info, it's a positive statement because it's a correct fact. Alternatively, it's more of a fact rather than an implication.

F: The law of diminishing returns applies to the production of both consumer goods and weapons.
No, I think the law of diminishing returns applies only to production of goods in general, not just consumer goods. It's about the marginal returns to inputs. So F is incorrect. It's a negative statement because it's not correctly applying the law.

G: Nations ought to devote at least some of their resources to national defense.
This is a recommendation, suggesting a policy. It's more like a negative statement in the context of positive economics because it's not about the fact that the economy is better off. It's more about what the economy should do, which is a policy choice. So G is negative.

H: Nations should prioritize military production to ensure their national security.
Similar to G, H is a recommendation. It's not a fact that can be proven from positive principles. So H is a negative statement.

I: An economy that produces more guns than butter is worse off than an economy that produces more butter than guns.
This is another general statement. It's a correct fact based on comparative advantage. For example, if the economy is efficient, it produces goods where it has the lowest opportunity cost. So if it's producing more of one good, it's better off. This is a positive statement because it's a correct fact based on economic principles. But wait, the PPF convexity is about opportunity costs decreasing, so perhaps this is correct.

Wait, let me go back. The statement I is about which economy is better off. So for example, if an economy is producing more guns, it's better off than producing more butter. But that's correct. So statement I is a correct fact, but it's not necessarily derived from any other principle. It's just a general observation. So is I a positive statement? Positive statements are those that can be logically derived from the premises. So I is a correct statement, but it's not an implication of any principle. It's a factual statement, so perhaps it's positive.

Wait, but the question is asking which statements are positive. So positive statements are those that are true and can be logically inferred.

So I is a factual statement about comparative advantage and production. It's a positive statement because it's a correct fact. So is it positive? Or is it a statement that's based on assumptions?

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the statement can be logically deduced from the premises. For example, if a nation has comparative advantage in producing a good, it can produce more of that good than another nation. So statement I is correct. So it's a positive statement.

J: The production possibilities frontier is concave to the origin because of the law of increasing costs.
A concave PPF indicates increasing opportunity costs, which happens when the law of increasing costs applies. So statement J is correct. It's a positive statement because it's a logical consequence of the law of increasing costs.

Wait, let me recap:

A: Correct, because increasing costs cause the PPF to slope downward.

B: Negative, it's a policy recommendation.

C: Correct, linear PPF due to constant costs.

D: Correct, convex due to decreasing costs.

E: Fact but not positive? Or positive? It's correct, but it's a factual statement, not necessarily derived from any principle. So I'm not sure. Alternatively, E is a fact that an economy can be better off by producing more of one good, regardless of the other.

Wait, E says that an economy producing more butter is better than producing more guns. So this is a general statement. It's a correct fact, but it's not something that can be logically deduced from any principles. Positive statements are those that can be logically derived from the premises. So E is a factual statement, not a logically derived one. So E is not a positive statement.

So let's go through each option again:

A: Correct. Law of increasing costs leads to a downward sloping PPF. So A is positive.

B: Incorrect. It's a policy recommendation, not a logical statement. So B is negative.

C: Correct. Linear PPF due to constant costs. So C is positive.

D: Correct. Convexity due to decreasing costs. So D is positive.

E: Fact, but not logically derived. So E is positive? Or not. It's a correct statement, but it's not a logically derived conclusion from principles. So E is a factual statement, not positive.

F: Incorrect. Law applies only to production, not only consumer goods. So F is negative.

G: Incorrect. Nations shouldn't necessarily produce at least some resources for defense. It's a recommendation. So G is negative.

H: Incorrect. Similar reasoning to G. Nations should prioritize defense, not a recommendation. So H is negative.

I: Correct. Because nations should produce more of their comparative advantage. So I is positive.

J: Correct. Concave PPF due to increasing costs. So J is positive.

So which of these statements are positive?

Looking back:

A: Correct.

C: Correct.

D: Correct.

E: Fact, correct, not logically derived. So E is a factual statement, which is positive.

Wait, no. Positive statements must be derived from the premises, i.e., logically true. Statements like E are factual and correct, but not derived from the principles. So E is a positive statement? Or not?

Wait, the question is about positive statements, which are correct and can be logically deduced from the premises. So, for example, if the premise is that all resources are fully and efficiently used, then producing more butter (A) is better. So statement A is correct and positive.

Wait, the confusion is whether the statements are logically derived from the principles. So for example, statement E: An economy that produces more butter is better off than producing more guns. It's correct because if you are more efficient in producing butter, you can produce more. But this is not necessarily a direct logical consequence of any of the principles. So it's a general observation, not a conclusion from principles. Therefore, it's a positive statement because it's a correct fact, but it's not necessarily derived from the principles.

Wait, but positive statements are those that can be logically deduced from the premises. So if the premise is that all resources are fully utilized, then statement E is correct. But I'm not sure if E is a logical conclusion.

Alternatively, statement E could be considered as a factual statement that's correct, but it's not directly derived from the principles. So maybe it's not a positive statement.

Wait, the options are about which statements are positive. So the correct positive statements are those that can be logically derived.

Looking at the options:

A: Law of increasing costs leads to downward sloping PPF. So that's correct and a logical conclusion.

C: PPF linear because costs are constant. Correct, logical.

D: PPF convex because costs decrease. Correct, logical.

E: Fact that an economy with more butter is better off. It's correct, but it's not a conclusion based on principles, but a general observation.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. The law of increasing costs leads to a downward slope, which is correct (so A is positive). The law of diminishing returns leads to convex PPF because the opportunity costs are decreasing, so D is positive. The law of diminishing returns is about the slope of the PPF, so the convexity is because of the decreasing opportunity costs. So D is correct and thus positive.

E: That an economy can produce more butter without producing more guns. That's a fact, but it's not necessarily a conclusion based on principles. It's a factual statement, so it's correct but not derived from the principles. So E is correct but not a positive statement because it's not logically deduced from the premises. So E is not a positive statement.

So, positive statements are A, C, D, and J.

Wait, let me reevaluate each option:

A: Correct. It's a positive statement because it's a correct fact that can be logically derived.

C: Correct. Because if constant costs, the PPF is linear. So positive.

D: Convex PPF due to decreasing costs. Correct, so positive.

J: Correct. Concave because increasing costs. So J is positive.

E: Fact, correct, but not logically derived. So E is not a positive statement.

H: Negative, as it's a recommendation.

So the positive statements are A, C, D, J, and I? Wait, no. Earlier, I thought I was incorrect for E.

Wait, looking again:

Statement I: It's correct. So it's a positive statement.

Wait, let me go through each option again:

Looking at the options:

A: True. Correct.

B: Incorrect.

C: True. Correct.

D: True. Correct.

E: Correct, but not logically derived. So E is a factual statement, not positive.

F: Incorrect.

G: Incorrect.

H: Incorrect.

I: Correct. So I is positive.

J: Correct. So J is positive.

So the positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

Wait, but earlier I thought E was a positive statement, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, let me make a table:

Option | Correct? | Positive?
--- | --- | ---
A | Yes | Yes
B | No | No
C | Yes | Yes
D | Yes | Yes
E | Yes | No (not logically derived)
F | No | No
G | No | No
H | No | No
I | Yes | Yes
J | Yes | Yes

Wait, no. Because E is a factual statement, not logically derived from principles. So E is correct but not a positive statement.

So the positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

Wait, but I thought J is correct because it's a logical consequence. J: concave PPF due to increasing costs. So the statement J is correct, positive.

So the correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to list all the statements and whether they're positive:

1. A: Law of increasing costs leads to a downward sloping PPF. Correct. Positive.

2. B: Should concentrate on consumer goods. Incorrect. Negative.

3. C: PPF linear due to constant costs. Correct. Positive.

4. D: Convex PPF due to decreasing costs. Correct. Positive.

5. E: Economy with more butter is better. Fact, correct. Not positive.

6. F: Law applies only to consumer goods. Incorrect. Negative.

7. G: National defense. Negative.

8. H: Prioritize military. Negative.

9. I: Economy with more guns is better. Correct. So I is positive.

10. J: Concave because of increasing costs. Correct. So J is positive.

So the positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

Wait, but the options given in the question are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and the choices are A to J. The options are:

Options are A to J, and the question is which are positive. So the correct positive statements are the ones that are correct and can be logically derived.

So the correct answers are A, C, D, I, J.

Wait, but the question was asking which of the following statements is positive. So the options are all statements, and I need to select which are positive. But the way the question is phrased, perhaps the choices are individual options, and I need to pick all that are positive. But I can only choose one option.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, and the options are A to J, each is a statement. It asks which of the following statements is positive. So the correct answer would be the statements among A to J that are positive. But I'm supposed to pick the correct option from A to J, which is the answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is a multiple-choice where only one option is correct. But in the original question, the user says "The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." But this might not be relevant to the actual question.

Wait, the user is asking me to write the answer as a letter, like for example, the correct answer is option C, so I respond with C as the letter. But according to the initial analysis, the correct statements are A, C, D, I, J. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate which of the given options are positive. Let me think again.

Option E: An economy that produces more butter is better off than an economy that produces more guns. This is a factual statement based on comparative advantage. It's correct, but it's not a logical conclusion from the principles. So it's a factual statement, but not positive.

So the positive statements would be A, C, D, I, J. So the correct answer should be the ones that are positive. However, the initial question is presented as a multiple-choice with each statement being an option, and the user says the last character must be the chosen letter.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option as a possible correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer options are four of them. Wait, the question is presented as a multiple-choice question with options A to J, each being a statement, and the user is to choose all that apply. But in this case, the user is to select one letter as the answer, but the question may be to select all correct positive statements.

But the user instruction says to pick one letter as the answer, and the possible answers are A to J, each being a statement. So the correct statements are A, C, D, I, J. But wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can look up which of these are positive statements.

- The law of increasing costs leading to a downward sloping PPF is positive because it's a logical conclusion. So A is positive.

- The convex PPF due to decreasing opportunity costs is a positive because it's a logical consequence of the law of diminishing returns. So D is positive.

- The concave PPF due to increasing costs is positive because it's a logical result of the law of increasing costs. So J is positive.

- The statement about concave PPF because of increasing costs is correct. So J is positive.

- The statement about linear PPF due to constant costs is correct, so C is positive.

- The statement about convex PPF due to decreasing costs is correct, so D is positive.

- The statement about the economy producing more butter being better is correct, but it's a factual statement, not positive. So E is not positive.

- The statement about producing more guns being better is correct, but it's a factual observation, not a conclusion from principles. So it's not a positive statement.

- The statement about producing more butter than guns being better is correct, so I is positive.

Wait, but then the correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

But the options are from A to J, each is a statement. So the question is to select the correct ones. But the user wants me to choose among the letters.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which statements are positive, and the correct letters are A, C, D, I, J. But the original question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, and the user is to select the correct answer letter.

But perhaps the correct answer is all of them except E. However, this is a bit confusing.

But, given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in evaluating statement I.

Statement I: An economy that produces more butter than guns is better off than an economy that produces more guns than butter.

This is correct because the economy has an absolute advantage in producing butter. So statement I is correct and positive.

So the positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

But now, looking back, perhaps I'm wrong because statement I is correct, but it's not a logical conclusion from principles. It's a factual statement. So it's a positive statement because it's correct.

Wait, but the question is about positive statements. Thus, the correct ones are A, C, D, I, J. So the answer letters are A, C, D, I, J.

But the user's instruction says to select among the letters, so perhaps the correct answer is all of these except E.

But I think the correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

Wait, but let me refer back to the options. So the correct ones are A, C, D, I, J.

But since the user is to select the correct option, which is a letter, and the original options are A to J, and the question is to select the correct statements, perhaps I should choose all correct letters, but the user expects only one letter as the answer.

Wait, perhaps the user's initial question was to select one correct answer. So the correct answer is a single letter. So the correct statements are A, C, D, I, J. So the user is to choose these letters as the correct answers.

But now I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is all of these except E.

But I think the correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

Wait, but let me refer back to the options. So the question is which statements are positive.

Looking through the options, the correct ones are A, C, D, I, J.

Wait, but the user's instruction is to select the letter, so perhaps I should select all that apply, but the user expects only one letter. So perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, J. So the answer letters are A, C, D, I, J.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct statements are A, C, D, I, J. So I should select the letters that are correct.

But I'm getting stuck. To sum up: the correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, J. So the answer is A, C, D, I, J.

But the user's instruction is to select one letter, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is all of these except E.

But I'm not certain. Perhaps it's better to proceed with the conclusion that the correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, J.

So the answer should be these letters in the box.
</think>

The correct positive statements are A, C, D, I, and J. These statements are logically deduced based on the principles of economics, such as the law of increasing costs, the law of diminishing returns, and the properties of production possibilities frontiers (PPFs). Statements B, E, and G are not positive because they are either negative recommendations or factual statements that are not logically derived from the principles. 

Answer: A, C, D, I, J
