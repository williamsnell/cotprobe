Okay, so I've got this Python expression to evaluate: 4 + 3 % 2. Hmm, let me think about how Python handles the modulo operator. I remember that the modulo operator % gives the remainder when the first number is divided by the second. So, in this case, 3 % 2 is the remainder of 3 divided by 2. 

Wait, 3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 1, right? Because 2 times 1 is 2, subtracted from 3 leaves 1. So 3 % 2 equals 1. 

So the expression becomes 4 + 1. That should be 5. Let me check the options. Oh, looking at the options, option E is 8. Wait, that can't be right. Or maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait wait, no. Oh wait, I think I confused the order. Wait, 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, but the modulo operator truncates towards negative infinity for some cases, but I think in this case, since both are positive, it's straightforward. So 3%2 is indeed 1. So 4 + 1 is 5. 

Looking at the options again, option E is 8, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the order of operations here matters. Oh no, wait, in Python, the modulo operator has higher precedence than addition. So 3 % 2 is computed first, then added to 4. 

Wait, another thought: Could it be that the modulo operator is being applied to 4 and 3? Because if that's the case, 4%3 is 1, and then adding 3 would be 4. But wait, no, the expression is 4 + 3 %2. So 3%2 is 1, then 4+1=5. So the correct answer should be 5, which is option E.

Wait, but wait the options list includes E as 8. Did I miscalculate the modulo? Let me check 3 divided by 2 again. 2 times 1 is 2, so 3-2 is 1, so remainder is 1. So 3%2 is 1. So 4 + 1 is 5. So the correct answer is E. So why is there an 8 option? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Oh wait, perhaps I misread the expression. Oh wait, no, the expression is 4 + 3 % 2. So definitely 4 + 1 is 5. So the correct answer should be E, 5.
