Question:

Find the number of single rolls required to paper a room 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high, allowing for a 10% waste of paper. A single roll consists of 36 square feet of paper. Make allowance for openings, which include one window 3 feet by 8 feet and one door 4 feet by 9 feet.

Options:

A: 17 rolls
B: 20 rolls
C: 16 rolls
D: 23 rolls
E: 14 rolls
F: 19 rolls

Okay, so I've got this problem to solve about papering a room, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these calculations. But I'll try to take it step by step.

First, let's read the problem again. The room is 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high. They want to know how many single rolls are needed, each roll being 36 square feet of paper. Plus, we have to account for a 10% waste. Also, there are some openings: a window that's 3ft by 8ft and a door that's 4ft by 9ft. So I need to subtract the area of these openings from the total wall area.

Alright, let's start by calculating the total area of the walls. Since the room is rectangular, there are four walls. Two of them are 18ft long and 10ft high, and the other two are 12ft wide and 10ft high.

So, the area of one 18x10 wall is 18 * 10 = 180 sq ft. There are two of these, so 2*180 = 360 sq ft.

Then, the other two walls are 12x10, which is 120 sq ft each. Two of those would be 240 sq ft.

Adding those together: 360 + 240 = 600 sq ft. That's the total wall area without any openings.

But wait, there are some windows and doors. So I need to subtract their areas. The window is 3ft by 8ft, so that's 24 sq ft. The door is 4ft by 9ft, which is 36 sq ft. So total area to subtract is 24 +36=60 sq ft.

So, the total wall area after subtracting openings is 600 - 60 = 540 sq ft.

Now, each roll is 36 sq ft. So, how many rolls do I need? I think I should divide the total wall area by the area per roll.

540 / 36 = 15. So 15 rolls if there's no waste. But wait, the problem says to allow for a 10% waste. So I have to account for that.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total paper needed including waste first. So waste is 10%, so the total paper required is 15 * 1.10. Let me compute that.

15 * 1.10 = 16.5 rolls. But you can't have half a roll, so you'd need to round up to the next whole number, which is 17 rolls. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 17 as an option? Let me check the options again. Oh, looking back, option A is 17.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total wall area. Let me double-check.

Wait, the room is 18x12x10. So, the perimeter is 2*(18+12) = 2*30=60 feet. But the formula for the area of the four walls is 2*(length + width) * height. So that's 2*(18+12)*10 = 2*(30)*10=60*10=600. Yes, that's correct.

Then subtracting the window and door: 600 -60=540. So yes, 540.

Each roll is 36, so 540 /36=15. Including 10% waste, 15 *1.1=16.5. Since you can't buy a fraction, you round up to 17 rolls.

Wait, but wait, none of the options after checking—wait the options are from A to J, and the options include 17 (A). So the answer should be A:17 rolls.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a mistake in the calculation? Let me recount. 18x10x2=360, 12x10x2=240, total 600. Subtract window (3*8=24) and door (4*9=36): 600-60=540. Yes.

So 540/36=15 rolls without waste. But with 10% waste, we need to add 10% of 540. 10% of 540 is 54. So 540+54=594. But wait, no, that approach is not correct. Wait, because 10% waste is on the total paper you purchase. So the formula is: total paper needed = (total area)/(area per roll) * (1 + waste percentage). So 540 /36=15 rolls. Multiply by 1.1: 15*1.1=16.5. Since you can't have half a roll, you need to round up to 17 rolls.

But wait, another approach is to calculate the total paper required including waste as 540 * 1.1, but wait that would be 540*1.1=594. Then 594 /36=16.5. So same result, 17 rolls.

So the correct answer should be 17, which is option A.

The correct answer is A: 17 rolls.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Calculate Total Wall Area:**
   - The room dimensions are 18 ft (length) × 12 ft (width) × 10 ft (height).
   - Two walls are 18 ft × 10 ft: 2 × (18×10) = 360 sq ft.
   - The other two walls are 12 ft × 10 ft: 2 × (12×10) = 240 sq ft.
   - Total wall area: 360 + 240 = 600 sq ft.

2. **Subtract Windows and Doors:**
   - Window area: 3 ft × 8 ft = 24 sq ft.
   - Door area: 4 ft × 9 ft = 36 sq ft.
   - Total openings: 24 + 36 = 60 sq ft.
   - Adjusted wall area: 600 - 60 = 540 sq ft.

3. **Calculate Required Rolls Without Waste:**
   - Each roll is 36 sq ft.
   - Rolls needed: 540 / 36 = 15 rolls.

4. **Account for 10% Waste:**
   - Total paper needed with waste: 15 × 1.10 = 16.5 rolls.
   - Since you can't purchase half a roll, round up to 17 rolls.

Answer: A: 17 rolls.
