Question:

A homeowner said to a roofer, "My roof leaks. I think the old tiles are cracked. If you will replace them with all new tiles, I will pay you $5,000. " The roofer replied, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule. " The homeowner then remarked, "That's all right, but let me know soon. " Three days later, the roofer drove his pickup truck to the homeowner's home and unloaded the materials and equipment needed to perform the roofing job. When the homeowner looked out his window and saw what was transpiring, he immediately ran outside and exclaimed, "Stop! The deal's off. I decided to repair the roof myself. "In an action by the roofer against the homeowner for breach of contract, which of the following would provide the roofer with his best theory of recovery?

Options:

A: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to reject the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.
B: The roofer can recover because the homeowner breached the contract by deciding to repair the roof himself.
C: A unilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule."
D: A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule. "
E: A bilateral contract was formed when the homeowner said, "That's all right, but let me know soon."
F: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a bilateral contract, and the roofer accepted the offer by purchasing the materials and equipment needed for the job.
G: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed for the job.
H: A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed to do the job.
I: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.
J: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a bilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer unloaded the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a homeowner and a roofer's contract. The homeowner says his roof is leaking and thinks the old tiles are cracked. He offers to pay $5k if the roofer replaces the tiles. The roofer agrees and says he'll clear his schedule. Then the homeowner says it's okay but wants to know soon. Three days later, the roofer does the job, and the homeowner decides to repair himself instead.

The big question is about the contract's terms. The roofer is suing the homeowner for breach of contract, and we need to determine which option describes the best theory of recovery for the roofer.

Let me think about the elements of a contract here. There are unilateral and bilateral contracts. Unilateral is when one party makes an offer and the other has to accept. Bilateral is both sides agree to a specific performance.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Homeowner offers unilateral, roofer starts performance. So the offer was made, he starts doing work. That sounds like he's breached, so he's the one who breached. The theory here would be that the offer is unilateral, and when he starts, he's rejecting the offer. So the homeowner didn't accept, so he breached.

Option B: Homeowner breached by not accepting, but the roofer wins. But if the offer was made and the action is that the homeowner didn't accept, then the theory is that the homeowner breached. So B would say the homeowner breached, and the roofer doesn't win. But the question is about the best theory of recovery for the roofer. If the offer was made and the action is the homeowner didn't accept, then the offer was unilateral and the breach was when he refused. So the theory here is that the homeowner breached, and the offer was unilateral. So the answer might be A.

Option C: Unilateral contract was formed by the roofer's statement. But the statement was about the roofer's willingness, not about the contract being formed. The question is about whether the contract was formed, which depends on both parties' actions. Since the homeowner made an offer, and the roofer performed the work, the contract was bilateral because both agreed to perform. So C is incorrect because it's a unilateral contract formed by the roofer's statement, which doesn't form the contract itself.

Option D: Bilateral contract formed because both sides agreed. The roofer agreed to perform, the homeowner agreed to pay. So the contract was bilateral. But the question is about the best theory of recovery. If the contract was formed, then the next step is to see if either side breached.

Option E: Bilateral contract formed when the homeowner said it was okay. But the contract is formed when both agree. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Homeowner made a bilateral offer, and the roofer accepted by purchasing materials. But the homeowner didn't buy materials; he was just refusing to repair. So F is not correct.

Option G: Homeowner made a unilateral offer, and the offer became irrevocable when the materials were purchased. So if the materials were bought after the offer, the offer is irrevocable. So the contract was unilateral, and the offer was made, but it's unrevocable. So the theory here is that the offer was unilateral, and the offer became irrevocable when the materials were delivered.

Option H: Bilateral contract was formed when the roofer bought materials. But the homeowner didn't buy materials; he just refused. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Homeowner made a unilateral offer, and the roofer accepted by doing work. So the offer was made, and the action is the roofer accepted. That fits the contract being unilateral. The theory here is that the offer was made, and the acceptance is by the other side. So the offer is unilateral, and the acceptance is by the other. So the theory is that the offer was unilateral, and the acceptor (roofer) accepted, so the breach is by the homeowner. So if this is the case, the offer was unilateral, and the offer was made, and the action is that the offer was accepted by the other side.

Option J: Homeowner made a bilateral offer and the offer became irrevocable when the materials were delivered. But again, the materials weren't delivered yet. The homeowner didn't buy. So J is incorrect.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up some points. Let me re-express the facts.

Homeowner: Offers to pay $5,000 if roofer replaces tiles. The roofer agrees and starts working. Then, three days later, the roofer does the job, and the homeowner decides to repair himself. So during the three days, the homeowner didn't accept the offer, so he breached the contract.

So the contract was formed when the homeowner made an offer (unilateral, because he's the one making it). The roofer responds by performing, but the homeowner doesn't accept. So the contract was unilateral, and the offer was made, then the other party accepted by performing. But wait, no, the other side didn't accept; they just did the work. Wait, no, in a contract, the other side has to accept. So if the offer was made, and the other side (homeowner) didn't accept, then the offer is unrevocable or not?

Wait, the contract was formed when the homeowner made the offer. The roofer then did the work, but the homeowner didn't accept. So does that mean the offer is unrevocable? Or is the contract formed because both agree to perform?

Wait, the contract is formed when both parties agree to perform. So the contract was bilateral because both sides agreed to performâ€”homeowner made an offer, then the roofer accepted by performing. So the contract was bilateral.

But wait, the roofer didn't have an offer from the homeowner; the homeowner offered. The roofer then performed the work, but the homeowner didn't accept. So perhaps the contract was formed, but the offer was made, and the action is that the other side (homeowner) didn't accept.

Wait, no. Let's think: a contract is formed when both parties agree to perform. In this case, the homeowner (as the offeror) makes an offer, and then the roofer (acceptor) does the work. The contract is a bilateral contract because both sides agreed to perform.

Wait, but in this scenario, the homeowner's contract was to pay if the roofer replaces the tiles. The homeowner didn't buy the materials; the roofer did the work. So the contract is bilateral because both agreed to perform: the homeowner made an offer, and the roofer accepted by performing.

But the question is about the theory of the contract. So when the contract is formed, the offer is unilateral or bilateral.

In the scenario, the contract is formed because both parties agreed to perform. So the contract is bilateral.

But the question is about whether the contract was formed, and if the offer was unilateral or not.

Wait the options are about what the theory is for the roofer's recovery.

The scenario: the homeowner made an offer to pay $5k if the roofer replaces tiles. The roofer agrees to perform, so the contract is between the two. So the contract is bilateral.

But the question is about the best theory of recovery for the roofer. So what is the theory here? The contracts can be either unilateral or bilateral.

In this case, the contract is bilateral because both sides agreed to perform. So the contract is bilateral.

Wait, but the question is about the best theory for the roofer. Because the offer was made, and the roofer performed, the contract is bilateral. But the options are about whether the offer was unilateral or not.

Wait, looking back at the options. The options are about the theory concerning the contract.

Option G says the offer became irrevocable when the materials were bought. So the offer is made, and the contract is irrevocable. So that's a bilateral contract, because both parties agreed to perform.

Wait, but the offer was made by the homeowner. So the offer is unilateral, but the contract is bilateral because the two agreed.

Alternatively, if the contract was formed when the offer was made, the offer was unilateral, and the other side accepted by performing.

Wait, no. The contract is formed when both parties agree to perform. So the contract is bilateral.

So the contract is bilateral, but the offer was made by the homeowner. So the offer was made, and the contract is formed. So the offer was unilateral.

Wait, let me think again. The homeowner made an offer, which is an unilateral contract because he's the one making the offer. Then the roofer performs, which is an acceptance. So the contract is bilateral.

But the question is about the best theory for the roofer's recovery.

So the options are about whether the contract was formed, and the basis of breach.

Option G: Homeowner made an offer that was unilateral, and the offer became irrevocable when materials were bought. So the contract is between the two, and the offer is made, and the contract is irrevocable.

Wait, but the contract is formed when both agree to perform. So the contract is bilateral. So Option G is incorrect.

Option I: Homeowner made an offer, and the roofer accepted by doing the work. But that's about the acceptance. The contract was formed when the homeowner made the offer, so the offer is unilateral, and the contract is bilateral.

So the theory here is that the offer was made, and the other side accepted by performing the work. So the theory is that the offer was unilateral, and the acceptor (roofer) accepted, so the breach is on the offer.

So the contract is a unilateral contract because the offer was made by the homeowner, and the other side accepted by performing.

Putting it together: the contract was formed (bilateral, since both agreed), but the offer was unilateral.

Looking at the options, option A says the offer was unilateral, and the roofer manifested intent to reject. So that's the best theory. Because the offer wasn't accepted, the homeowner breached, and the contract was unilateral.

Looking at option I: the offer was made, and the other side accepted by performing. But that's about the acceptance, not the contract's form.

Wait, in the scenario, the contract was bilateral because both agreed to perform. The offer was made by the homeowner (unilateral), the roofer accepted by performing. So the contract is bilateral, but the basis was the homeowner's unilateral offer.

So the best theory is that the offer was unilateral, and the roofer didn't accept, so the contract was unilateral. Therefore, the theory is that the offer was made, and the other side accepted by performing, which is an acceptance. But the contract was formed as a bilateral agreement because both parties agreed.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option A: Homeowner offers unilateral, roofer starts performance. So the offer was made, and he starts performance. That's the case when the offer is made, and the other party starts performing. So the theory is that the offer was unilateral, and the roofer's performance is a rejection. So the offer was made, and the other party starts performing, so the contract is unrevocable (or it's the other side that's the one performing).

Wait, no. The contract is formed when both parties agree to perform. So the contract is bilateral, but the offer was made by one party, so it's unilateral.

In this case, the offer was made by the homeowner, so the contract was unilateral. The other side (roofer) performed by unconditionally doing the work. So the contract was unilateral, and the offer was made, and the other side accepted (by performing). So the theory is that the offer was made, and the other side accepted, making the contract a bilateral one. But the contract is only formed when both agree to perform. So the contract is bilateral, but the offer was made, and the other side accepted.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of it as a two-part contract.

If the contract is bilateral, both parties agree to a certain performance. If the contract is unilateral, one party makes an offer, and the other party either accepts or rejects.

In this case, the contract was bilateral because both parties agreed to replace tiles. The offer was made by the homeowner (unilateral), and the roofer performed by doing the work (acceptance). So the contract was formed, and the offer was made, but the other side accepted, making the contract's form depend on both sides.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let's consider the options again.

The correct answer should be the one that describes the theory that the offer was made, and the other party accepted, making the contract's form a bilateral one. But the offer was made by the homeowner, so the contract was a unilateral offer.

Wait, no. The contract is formed when both parties agree to perform. So the offer is made, and the contract is formed. So the offer was made, and the contract is formed as a bilateral agreement because both agreed. So the theory is that the offer was made, and the contract is bilateral, but the offer is made by one side, so it's a unilateral contract.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the correct answer is.

In the facts, the contract was between the homeowner and the roofer. The homeowner offered to pay if the roofer replaces tiles. The roofer agreed to perform, so the contract is bilateral. The offer was made by the homeowner (unilateral), and the roofer performed by doing the work, which is an acceptance.

Wait, but the contract was formed when both parties agreed to perform. So the contract was bilateral, but the offer was made by one side (homeowner), so the contract is a unilateral contract.

The best theory for the roofer's recovery is that the offer was made (unilateral), and the other side accepted (so the contract is now a bilateral agreement). So the theory is that the offer was unilateral, and the other side accepted by performing, making the contract a bilateral agreement.

Wait, but the contract is formed when both parties agree, so the contract is bilateral. Therefore, the offer was made, and the contract is bilateral because both agreed. So the contract is bilateral, and the offer was made, but it's an unilateral contract because only one side made the offer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A says the offer was unilateral, and the roofer started performance. So the offer was made, the other side starts performing, so the contract is unrevocable. So the theory is that the offer was made, and the other side accepted, making the contract a bilateral agreement.

But the contract was formed when both agreed, so it's a bilateral agreement. So in this case, the contract is bilateral, but the basis was the homeowner's offer. So the offer was made, and the contract is bilateral because both parties agreed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because when the offer was made, the contract is considered as the contract being formed when both agree. So the contract can be either, but the basis is the offer.

Alternatively, the best theory is that the offer was made, and the other side accepted by performing, so the contract is bilateral.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the contract is bilateral because both parties agreed to perform. The offer was made by the homeowner, making an unilateral contract. The roofer then performed, which is an acceptance. So the contract is now a bilateral agreement because both agreed.

But the options are about the basis of the contract. For the contract to be Bilateral, both parties must agree. So the contract is formed as a bilateral agreement, but the basis is the offer made by the homeowner.

So the best theory is that the offer was made (unilateral), and the contract is bilateral because both parties agreed. So the theory is that the offer was made, and the other side accepted, making the contract a bilateral agreement.

But looking at the options, the options don't directly address that. Let me see:

Option A: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to reject the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.

Hmm, that sounds like the offer was made, the other side (roofer) performed and decided to reject, making the contract unrevocable. So the contract was formed as a unilateral contract, but that doesn't make sense because the contract is bilateral.

Wait, no. The offer was made by the homeowner, so the contract is a unilateral contract. The roofer then performed, which is an acceptance by the other side (the roofer). So the contract is a bilateral agreement because both agreed. But the offer was made by one side, making it a unilateral contract.

Wait, but the contract can be either. So if the contract is formed when both agree, and the offer is made by one side, then the contract is a unilateral contract.

So the best theory of recovery is that the offer was made, and the other side accepted, making the contract a bilateral agreement. But the contract was formed as a unilateral contract because only one side made the offer.

Wait, perhaps the contract is considered a unilateral contract because the offer was made by the homeowner, and the other side accepted by performing. But the contract is actually a bilateral agreement because both agreed.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option G says the offer became irrevocable when the materials were bought. So the contract is bilateral, and the offer is made but becomes irrevocable. So the contract is formed, but it's now unrevocable.

Wait, no. The contract is between the two. The offer was made, and the contract is formed. If the offer wasn't made, the contract doesn't form. So the offer made here is a unilateral contract.

So the contract is a unilateral contract because only the homeowner made the offer, and the other side accepted by performing. So the contract is formed as a bilateral agreement, but the basis was the offer's unilaterality.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because when the offer was made, the other side (roofer) started performing and decided to reject. So the contract is unrevocable.

Wait, no. The contract is formed when both agree. So the contract is a bilateral agreement. The offer was made by one side, making it a unilateral contract. The other side accepted by performing, making the contract bilateral.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let's try to think of the correct answer.

The correct answer is likely option A.

Because the offer was made (unilateral), and the other side (roofer) started performing and decided to reject, making the contract unrevocable. So the theory is that the offer was made, and the other side was intent to reject, making the contract unrevocable, thus the contract was unilateral.

Wait, no. Wait, in the contract law, when one party makes the offer, and the other party does the performance, and the other party decides to reject, the contract is unrevocable. So the contract is formed as a bilateral agreement, but the basis is the unilaterality of the offer.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of it as a two-part contract.

Option G: The offer became irrevocable when the materials were purchased. So the contract is formed as a bilateral agreement, and the offer is made, but it's irrevocable. So the contract is now unrevocable, but the contract was formed as a bilateral agreement because both agreed.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because the offer was made, and the other side accepted by performing, making the contract unrevocable. So the contract is formed as a bilateral agreement, but the contract's form is because the offer was made. So the contract is formed as a bilateral agreement, but the offer was made unilaterally, making it a unilateral contract.

Alternatively, the contract is formed as a bilateral agreement, but the offer was made unilaterally, so the contract is a unilateral contract.

So looking at the options, the correct answer would be option A: the offer was made (unilateral), the other side started performing (accepting by doing), which makes the contract unrevocable.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The key here is that the contract was formed when both parties agreed to perform. But the offer is made by one side, making it a unilateral contract. The other side's performance makes the contract unrevocable. So the contract is considered as a bilateral agreement, but because the offer was made, it's a unilateral contract.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the options again.

The correct answer is option A.

Because the offer was made (unilateral), and the other side (roofer) accepted by performing, making the contract unrevocable. So the contract was formed as a bilateral agreement, but the basis was the unilaterality.

So the best theory is that the offer was made, and the other side accepted by performing, making the contract unrevocable, thus the contract is a unilateral contract.

Wait, no. The contract is formed when both parties agree to perform. So the contract is a bilateral agreement, but the offer was made by one side, making it a unilateral contract.

So the correct answer is option A: The offer was made, and the other side (roofer) accepted by performing, making the contract unrevocable.

Wait, but the contract is formed when both parties agreed to perform, making it a bilateral agreement. The basis is the offer made by one side, making it a unilateral contract.

So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct answer was option A.

So to recap, the contract was formed when both parties agreed to perform. The offer was made by one side (homeowner), making it a unilateral contract. The other side (roofer) accepted by performing, making the contract unrevocable. So the contract is considered as a bilateral agreement because both agreed, but the basis is the unilaterality of the offer.

So the best theory is option A.
</think>

The correct answer is **Option A**. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Contract Formation**: The contract was formed when both the homeowner (whoer) and the roofer agreed to perform the task of replacing tiles. This mutual agreement constitutes a bilateral contract.

2. **Offer and Contract Type**: The offer was made by the homeowner. Since only one party made the offer, the contract became a unilateral contract. 

3. **Performance and Rejection**: The roofer, upon performing the task, decided to reject the offer. This decision to reject the offer by performing the task makes the contract unrevocable.

4. **Best Theory**: The best theory of recovery is that the offer was made, and the other side (roofer) accepted by performing, making the contract unrevocable. This describes the basis of the contract as a unilateral contract, which is the correct legal outcome in this scenario.

ANSWER: A
