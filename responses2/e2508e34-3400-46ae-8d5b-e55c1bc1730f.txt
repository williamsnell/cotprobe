Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a spherical water drop suspended in calm air because of an electric field. I need to find the magnitude of the gravitational force on the drop.

Hmm, the drop has a diameter of 1.20 micrometers. I think micrometers are millionths of a meter, right? So the radius would be half of that, which is 0.60 micrometers. Let me convert that to meters. Oh wait, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so radius r is 0.60e-6 m.

Wait, the electric field E is given as 462 N/C. Oh right, because the drop is suspended, that must mean that the electric force is balancing the gravitational force. So the electric force (F_electric) equals the gravitational force (F_gravity). But the question is about F_gravity, so I can set them equal.

The electric force on a charged particle is F_electric = q * E, where q is the charge. And the gravitational force is F_gravity = m * g, where m is mass and g is acceleration due to gravity, which is about 9.8 m/s².

So, setting them equal: q * E = m * g. But wait, I don't know the charge q. Oh, wait, since the drop is suspended, the electric field must be pointing downward, so the electric force is downward as well. But the problem is about the gravitational force, so perhaps I can use the charge to find the mass.

But wait, wait. Wait a minute, I don't know the charge. Oh, but wait, the drop is a water droplet, so maybe it's charged. But the problem doesn't say anything about charge. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass directly from the gravitational force if I can find the charge.

Wait no, perhaps another approach. Since the drop is suspended, the electric force must balance the gravitational force. So F_electric = F_gravity. So F_gravity = q * E. But I don't know q. Wait, maybe I should find the charge in terms of the electric field. But that's not given, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: the drop is a water droplet, so its charge can be found if it's conducting. But the problem doesn't give any information about charge. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the gravitational force directly, as the gravitational force is m * g. But I need to find m. The mass of a water droplet can be found using the density of water and volume. The volume is (4/3) pi r^3. So, first, calculate the volume.

The radius is 0.60e-6 meters. So volume V = (4/3) * π * (0.6e-6)^3. Let me compute that.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. (0.6e-6)^3 is (0.6)^3 * (1e-6)^3 )= 0.216e-18 m³. Multiply by (4/3)π: 4/3 * π ≈ 4.1888. So 4.1888 * 0.216e-18 ≈ let's compute 4.1888 * 0.216.

Hmm, 4 * 0.216 is 0.864, 0.1888 * 0.216 ≈ approximately 0.0407. So total is about 0.9047e-18 m³.

So V ≈ 0.9047e-18 m³. Now, the mass of water is density * volume. The density of water is about 1000 kg/m³. So m = 1000 kg/m³ * 0.9047e-18 m³ = 904.7e-18 kg, which is 9.047e-16 kg. Wait, that's 9.047e-16 kg. Then, F_gravity = m * g = 9.047e-16 kg * 9.8 m/s².

Calculating 9.047e-16 *9.8: 9.047 *9.8 = approx 88.66. So 88.66e-16 N? Wait, that can't be right because the options are on the order of 1e-15.

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the volume calculation.

Wait, so let me recalculate V.

r = 0.6e-6 m. So r³ is (0.6e-6)^3. 0.6^3 is 0.216. So (0.6e-6)^3 = 0.216e-18 m³. Then, V = (4/3) π * 0.216e-18.

Wait, 4/3 π is about 4.1888. So 4.1888 * 0.216e-18 = let's compute this.

4 * 0.216 = 0.864, 0.1888 * 0.216 = let's compute 0.1888 * 0.2 is 0.03776, and 0.1888 *0.016=0.0030208. So total 0.03776 + 0.0030208 = 0.0407808. So 0.864 +0.0407808 = 0.9047808. So V ≈ 0.90478e-18 m³, which is 9.0478e-19 m³? Wait, no, wait, 0.90478e-18 m³ is 9.0478e-19 m³, because 0.9 is 9e-1, so 0.90478e-18 is 9.0478e-19.

Wait, no, 0.90478e-18 m³ is 9.0478e-19 m³? No, wait, 0.90478e-18 is 9.0478e-19? No, no, wait. Let me think: 1e-18 is 0.90478e-18 is 0.90478 * 1e-18 = 9.0478e-19. Yes, correct.

So V = 9.0478e-19 m³. So m = density * volume = 1000 kg/m³ * 9.0478e-19 m³ = 9.0478e-16 kg. So m is 9.0478e-16 kg.

Wait, but if I calculate F_gravity = m g, which is 9.0478e-16 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me compute that. 9e-16 *9.8 is 8.82e-15 N. But wait, the options don't have that. Let's look at the options:

Options are in the 1e-15 range, like 1e-15, 1e-16, etc. Wait, none of the options match exactly with 8.8e-15. Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the volume. Wait, 0.6 micrometers is 0.6e-6 meters. So radius is 0.3e-6 m? Wait, wait no, no. Wait, no, the diameter is 1.20 micrometers. So radius is 0.6 micrometers, which is 0.6e-6 m. So that's correct.

So V = (4/3)π*(0.6e-6)^3. Let me compute that again.

(0.6e-6)^3 = 0.6^3 * (1e-6)^3 = 0.216 * 1e-18 = 2.16e-19 m³. Oh wait, wait! I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Because 0.6 is (6e-1), not 0.6e-6. Wait, no, 0.6e-6 is 6e-7 meters. Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponent.

Wait, the diameter is 1.20 micrometers, so radius is 0.6 micrometers, which is 0.6e-6 meters. So (0.6e-6 m)^3 is (0.6)^3 = 0.216, and (1e-6)^3 = 1e-18, so 0.216e-18 m³. So the volume is (4/3)π * 0.216e-18 = 4/3 * 3.1416 * 0.216e-18.

Wait, 4/3 * π is about 4.1888. So 4.1888 * 0.216 = let's compute. 4 * 0.216 is 0.864. 0.1888 * 0.216 is about 0.04078. So total is approximately 0.90478. So 0.90478e-18 m³.

Wait, so V is 0.90478e-18 m³. So volume is 9.0478e-19 m³? No, wait, 0.90478e-18 is 9.0478e-19. Because 0.90478e-18 is (0.90478)*1e-18 = 9.0478e-19. So yes, correct.

Now, the mass m = density * volume. Density of water is 1000 kg/m³. So m = 1000 * 9.0478e-19 kg = 9.0478e-16 kg.

Then, F_gravity = m * g = 9.0478e-16 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me compute that.

9e-16 kg *9.8 is 8.82e-15 N. So about 8.82e-15 N.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 7.65e-15 N, option G is 6.5e-15, option F is 11.34e-15, option E is 12.21e-15, option A is 10.00e-15, etc.

So none of the options exactly match 8.82e-15 N. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the electric force instead and see if that's the case. Wait, but the problem asks for the gravitational force.

Wait, another approach: maybe the charge is not needed because the electric force is equal to the gravitational force, so perhaps I can compute the electric force directly and it should be the same as the gravitational.

Wait, but the electric force is F_electric = q E. But without knowing q, I can't compute it. So perhaps the question is expecting me to compute the electric force, but that's not what the question asks. Oh wait, the question asks for the gravitational force.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong radius. The diameter is 1.20 micrometers, so radius is 0.6 micrometers =6e-7 meters? No, wait, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so 0.6 micrometers is 6e-7 meters. So I think that was correct. So V would be (4/3)*pi*(6e-7)^3. Let me compute that.

6e-7 meters cubed is (6e-7)^3 = 216e-21 m³. (Because (6)^3=216. (e-7)^3 = e-21). So 216e-21 m³. Multiply by 4/3 pi: 4/3 * pi * 216e-21 = (4 * 216 * pi) / 3 *e-21.

Wait, 4 * 216 is 864, so 864/3 = 288. So 288 * pi ≈ 288 *3.1416 ≈ 904.778. So 904.778e-21 m³. So V ≈ 9.04778e-19 m³. Same as before. So mass is 1000 *9.04778e-19 =9.04778e-16 kg. So same as before.

So F_grav is 9.04778e-16 kg *9.8 m/s² = 8.847e-15 N. So approximately 8.847e-15 N. Looking at the options:

Option D is 7.65e-15 N. Option G is 6.5e-15, Option F is 11.34e-15, Option E 12.21e-15, Option A 10.00e-15. So none of these match.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which is close to 8.847e-15. None of the options are exactly 8.8e-15. The closest is option D (7.65e-15) and option F (11.34e-15). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume. Let's recompute the volume.

Radius is 0.6 micrometers = 0.6e-6 m.

Volume = (4/3) * π * (0.6e-6)^3.

(0.6e-6)^3 = 0.216e-18 m³.

Multiply by 4/3 pi: 4/3 *3.1416 * 0.216e-18.

4/3 is approximately 1.3333. 1.3333 *3.1416 ≈4.1888.

4.1888 *0.216 ≈0.90477.

So volume is 0.90477e-18 m³. Which is 9.0477e-19 m³. So mass is 1000 kg/m³ *9.0477e-19 m³ =9.0477e-16 kg. So F_grav is 9.0477e-16 *9.8=8.8467e-15 N.

Hmm, so none of the options match. Wait, but the options are:

A: 10.00×10^-15 → 1e-15 ×10 =1e-14? No, 10e-15 is 1e-14. So 1e-15 is 1.0e-15.

Wait, let me see all the options again:

A: 10.00 ×10^-15 → 10e-15 =1e-14. So 10^-14 → 10e-15 is 1e-14.

B:9.25e-15,

C:7.98e-15,

D:7.65e-15,

E:12.21e-15,

F:11.34e-15,

G:6.5e-15,

H:8.5e-15,

I:8.87e-15,

J:13.00e-15.

Wait, 8.847e-15 is close to option I, which is 8.87e-15. But wait, what's the correct answer?

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the electric force and set it equal to the gravitational force.

The electric force is F_electric = q * E.

The gravitational force is F_gravity = m * g.

Setting them equal: q E = m g.

We can solve for F_gravity: F_gravity = (m g) = m (g) = m (E q / E )= m E q / q?

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the charge q from F_electric = q E.

But since the drop is suspended, that's the condition. So F_electric = F_gravity → q E = m g → m = q E / g.

But without knowing q, that's not helpful. Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the gravitational force calculation, which I did.

So the gravitational force is 8.847e-15 N. Looking for the closest option: the options are:

Option G:6.5e-15,

Option F:11.34e-15,

Option I:8.87e-15.

So option I is 8.87e-15 N, which is very close to our calculated value of 8.847e-15 N.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume. Let me recompute V.

Another approach: Let me compute the volume using the formula.

Radius r = 0.6 micrometers = 6e-7 meters.

V = (4/3) * pi * (6e-7)^3.

Compute (6e-7)^3 = 6^3 * (1e-7)^3 = 216 *1e-21 = 2.16e-19 m³.

Multiply by (4/3)*pi: 4/3 * 3.1416 = approximately 4.1888. 4.1888 * 2.16e-19 = let's compute that.

4 * 2.16e-19 = 8.64e-19,

0.1888 *2.16e-19 ≈ approx 0.4077e-19,

So total is 8.64e-19 + 0.4077e-19 =9.0477e-19 m³.

Wait, but wait, that's the same as the earlier calculation. So V =9.0477e-19 m³.

Wait, or 9.0477e-19 m³ is 9.0477e-19 m³. So mass is 1000 kg/m³ *9.0477e-19 m³ =9.0477e-16 kg.

So F_gravity = m g =9.0477e-16 kg *9.8 m/s².

Calculate that:

9.0477e-16 *9.8 = (9.0477 *9.8) e-16.

9.0477 *9.8: Let's compute that.

9 *9.8=88.2.

0.0477 *9.8 =0.46746.

So total is 88.2 +0.46746 =88.66746.

So F_gravity=88.66746e-16 N.

Which is 8.8667e-15 N.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option I:8.87e-15.

So the answer would be option I.

Wait, but another thought: did the problem give the electric field, and then I have to compute the electric force? Because the problem says the drop is suspended, which implies that the electric force must balance the gravitational force.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the electric force and set it equal to the gravitational force.

So let's compute the electric force: F_electric = q * E.

But I don't know q, so I can't proceed that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the gravitational force, and the options match closely.

Wait, but in reality, the calculation gives approximately 8.87e-15 N, which is option I. So the correct answer is option I.

To determine the gravitational force acting on the water drop, we start by calculating the volume of the drop. The diameter of the drop is 1.20 micrometers, so the radius is 0.60 micrometers or \(0.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\). The volume of a sphere is given by:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Substituting \(r = 0.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\):

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.6 \times 10^{-6})^3
\]

\[
(0.6 \times 10^{-6})^3 = 0.216 \times 10^{-18} = 2.16 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (2.16 \times 10^{-19})
\]

\[
V \approx 4.1888 \times 2.16 \times 10^{-19} \approx 9.0478 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{m}^3
\]

The density of water is \(1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3\), so the mass of the water drop is:

\[
m = \rho V = 1000 \times 9.0478 \times 10^{-19} = 9.0478 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{kg}
\]

The gravitational force is then:

\[
F_{\text{gravity}} = m g = (9.0478 \times 10^{-16}) \times 9.8 = 8.8467 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{N}
\]

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option I: \(8.87 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{N}\)** is very close to the calculated value \(8.8467 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{N}\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**ANSWER: I**
