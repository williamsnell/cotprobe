Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an object floating in water and determining what percentage of its volume is above the surface. Hmm, I remember something about buoyancy and floating objects.

The object has a volume of 2e-3 m³, which is 0.002 cubic meters. Its weight is 6 Newtons. Wait, I think the formula for buoyancy is related to the weight of the displaced water. Oh right, Archimedes' principle says that the buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. Since the object is floating, the buoyant force must equal the object's weight.

So the weight of the displaced water should be 6 N. The density of water is known, right? I think it's 1000 kg/m³. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is Buoyant force equals density of the fluid times the volume displaced times gravity. So F_b = ρ_water * V_displaced * g.

Wait, the object's weight is F_weight = m * g, where m is the mass. But wait, the object's weight is 6 N, so F_weight = 6 N. So by floatation, F_b = F_weight = 6 N.

So, 6 N = (1000 kg/m³) * V_displaced * (9.8 m/s²). Let me solve for V_displaced. 

V_displaced = 6 N / (1000 * 9.8) = (6)/(9800) m³. Let me compute that. 6 divided by 9800 is 0.000612245 m³.

Wait, but I need to find the percentage of the object's volume that's submerged, but the question asks for the percentage above the surface. So if V_submerged is 0.000612245 m³, then the volume above is the total volume minus that.

Total volume is 0.002 m³. So V_above = 0.002 - 0.000612245 = 0.001387755 m³.

Now, the percentage above is (V_above / V_total) * 100%. 

So 0.001387755 / 0.002 *100% = (0.6938775) * 100% ≈ 69.38775%. Hmm, that's about 69.39%.

Looking at the options, I see option D is 60%, H is 90%, etc. Wait, 69.39% isn't one of the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the weight is 6 N. The buoyant force is equal to the weight, so F_b = 6 N. 

So V_displaced = F_b / (density * g) = 6 / (1000 * 9.81) ≈ 6/(9810) ≈ 0.0006117 m³.

So V_submerged is approximately 0.0006117 m³.

V_above is 0.002 - 0.0006117 = 0.0013883 m³.

Now, the percentage above is (0.0013883 / 0.002)*100 = 69.415%.

Hmm, none of the options are exactly 69.415%. Let's look at the options again.

Options are given as percentages, so maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's calculate it precisely.

F_b = 6 N.

V_submerged = 6/(1000 * 9.81) = 6/(9810) ≈ 0.000611628 m³.

V_above = 0.002 - 0.000611628 = 0.001388372 m³.

Percentage above is (0.001388372 / 0.002) *100 = (0.694186) *100 = 69.4186%, approximately 69.42%.

Looking at the options, none of the given percentages match exactly. The options are 60%, 70%, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another approach: since the density of water is about 1000 kg/m³, and the object's density is mass/volume. Mass is weight/g, so mass = 6 N /9.81 m/s² ≈ 0.6122 kg. So density = 0.6122 kg / 0.002 m³ = 306.1 kg/m³.

Wait, that's higher than water! Oh wait, no! Because when an object floats, its average density is less than water. Wait, but wait, 306 kg/m³ is actually higher than water's 1000 kg/m³. That can't be right. Wait, wait, that can't be correct because an object can't have a higher density than water and float. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, wait, the object's mass is 6 N / 9.81 = approx 0.612 kg. Volume is 0.002 m³. So density is 0.612 / 0.002 = 306 kg/m³. Wait, that's way higher than water. That's impossible because it would sink, not float. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute. The object is placed in water and floats. So its density must be less than water. But when I compute the density, I get higher than water. So I must have messed up in calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation for the density.

Mass is 6 N / 9.81 m/s² = 0.612 kg.

Volume is 0.002 m³.

Density = mass / volume = 0.612 kg /0.002 m³ = 306 kg/m³.

Wait, that's way higher than water's 1000 kg/m³. So the object can't float, right? But the problem says it floats. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait! Maybe I misread the problem. Let me look again.

The object has a volume of 2e-3 m³ (0.002 m³) and a weight of 6 N. So when I calculate density, it's 0.612 kg / 0.002 m³ = 306 kg/m³. That's more than water's density, which is 1000 kg/m³. So that's impossible. Hence, the object can't float. But the problem says it does. So maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let's recheck the math.

Weight is 6 N, so mass is 6 / 9.81 = approx 0.612 kg.

Volume is 0.002 m³.

Density = 0.612 kg / 0.002 m³ = 306 kg/m³. 

Wait, but water's density is 1000 kg/m³. So 306 < 1000, so it's less dense. So it should float. So why am I getting a higher density? Did I make a calculation error?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it again.

6 N / 9.81 m/s² is 6 /9.81 = 0.612244898 kg.

Volume is 0.002 m³.

Density = 0.612244898 / 0.002 = 306.122449 kg/m³. Yes, correct.

Wait, but that's much higher than water's density. So this suggests that the object can't float because it's denser than water. But the problem says it floats. So perhaps I misread the question.

Wait no, the question says it floats. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait wait, perhaps I should think that the problem is actually about an object submerged such that the buoyant force equals the object's weight. Whether it's floating or submerged, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced water. But if the object is floating, then the buoyant force equals the object's weight. So perhaps I should compute the volume submerged, not the total displaced.

Wait, maybe I confused the displaced volume with the total volume. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me approach this systematically.

The object's weight is 6 N. So the buoyant force, which is the weight of the water displaced, must equal 6 N.

So, F_b = ρ_water * V_submerged * g.

We can solve for V_submerged.

V_submerged = F_b / (ρ_water * g) = 6 / (1000 * 9.81) = 6 / 9810 = approx 0.000611628 m³.

So the volume submerged is 0.000611628 m³.

The total volume of the object is 0.002 m³.

So the volume above the water is 0.002 - 0.000611628 = 0.001388372 m³.

Now, the fraction above is (0.001388372)/(0.002) = 0.694186.

So approximately 69.42% of the volume is above water.

Looking at the options, I don't see 69.42%. The closest option is option H, which is 90%. Hmmm, no, wait. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A:80%

B:12%

C:10%

D:60%

E:20%

F:70%

G:30%

H:90%

I:40%

J:50%

Wait, none of the options have 69%. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the percentage above as (1 - (V_submerged / V_total)) *100.

Because (V_submerged / V_total) is the fraction submerged, so 1 - that is the fraction above.

So, V_submerged is 0.000611628 m³, V_total is 0.002 m³.

So, V_submerged / V_total = 0.000611628 / 0.002 = 0.305814.

So the fraction above is 1 - 0.305814 = 0.694186, which is 69.4186%. So that's 69.42%, which is approximately 69.4%.

Looking at the options, none of them match exactly. Let me reevaluate the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the percentage submerged but the percentage above. So the options given don't have 69.4%. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait another approach: maybe using the specific gravity. Specific gravity is (density of object)/(density of water). Since object's density is 0.612 kg/m³, which is way higher than water's 1000 kg/m³, so it should sink, not float. But the problem says it floats. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should consider the given data correctly. Let's recheck.

The object's weight is 6 N. So mass is 6 N / 9.81 m/s² = 0.612 kg.

Volume is 0.002 m³. So density is 0.612 /0.002 = 306 kg/m³.

Which is higher than water's density (1000 kg/m³), so it can't float. So the problem must have an error, but since it's a question, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think that perhaps the object is submerged, and the buoyancy equals the weight. Wait, but if it's floating, the buoyant force equals the weight, which is 6 N. So the volume displaced should be V = F_b / (ρ_water * g) = 6/(1000 *9.81) = 0.0006116 m³.

So, the fraction submerged is 0.0006116 / 0.002 = 0.305814, so 30.58% submerged. So the fraction above is 69.42%, which is around 69.4%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem meant the object is submerged, but it's given as floating. Or perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute using the given options. Because the options don't match the calculated 69.42%, perhaps I should consider what the object would be doing.

Wait, for instance, if the volume above is 60% of 0.002, that's 0.0012 m³. So V_submerged would be 0.0008 m³. Then, the density of the object would be 0.612 kg /0.0008 m³ = 765 kg/m³, which is still higher than water, so it can't float.

Wait, if the object's density is 700 kg/m³, then V_submerged = 6/(700*9.81) = 6/(6867) ≈ 0.000876 m³. Then, V_above is 0.002 - 0.000876 = 0.001124 m³. The percentage above is (0.001124/0.002)*100 = 56.2%, which is about 56%, not matching any option.

Alternatively, if the object's density is 900 kg/m³, then V_submerged =6/(900*9.81) =6/(8829)≈0.000679 m³. V_above is 0.002 -0.000679≈0.001321 m³. Percentage above is (0.001321/0.002)*100 ≈66%, which is closer to 66%, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the given options have a typo. Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fraction above. Let me try that again.

F_b = 6 N.

V_submerged = 6/(1000 *9.81) =6/9810 = 0.000611628 m³.

V_above = 0.002 -0.000611628 = 0.001388372 m³.

Percentage above = (0.001388372 /0.002)*100 = 69.4186%.

So the nearest option is 70% (option F), but the exact calculation gives 69.42%, which is closer to 70% than 60%.

Wait, but looking at the options, one of them is 70% (option F). So perhaps the correct answer is 70%, even though the actual percentage is about 69.42%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should round it to the nearest option, which would be 70%. So the correct answer would be option F: 70%.

To determine the percentage of the object's volume that is above the surface of the water, we use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. Since the object is floating, the buoyant force equals the object's weight:

\[
F_{\text{b}} = \text{Weight of the object} = 6 \, \text{N}.
\]

The buoyant force is also given by:

\[
F_{\text{b}} = \rho_{\text{water}} \cdot V_{\text{submerged}} \cdot g,
\]

where \( \rho_{\text{water}} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( V_{\text{submerged}} \) is the volume of water displaced. Solving for \( V_{\text{submerged}} \):

\[
V_{\text{submerged}} = \frac{F_{\text{b}}}{\rho_{\text{water}} \cdot g} = \frac{6}{1000 \cdot 9.81} = 0.000611628 \, \text{m}^3.
\]

The total volume of the object is given as \( V_{\text{total}} = 0.002 \, \text{m}^3 \). The volume of the object above the water is:

\[
V_{\text{above}} = V_{\text{total}} - V_{\text{submerged}} = 0.002 - 0.000611628 = 0.001388372 \, \text{m}^3.
\]

The percentage of the object's volume that is above the water is:

\[
\text{Percentage above} = \left( \frac{V_{\text{above}}}{V_{\text{total}}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{0.001388372}{0.002} \right) \cdot 100 \approx 69.42\%.
\]

Since the calculated value (69.42%) does not match any of the provided options exactly, the closest option is **70%**. This slight discrepancy may arise from rounding.
