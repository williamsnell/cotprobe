Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a magnifying glass and a person's vision. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. So, the question is about finding the best position for the object when using a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass has a focal length of 6 cm. The person's smallest distance of distinct vision is 25 cm. They hold the glass close to the eye.

Wait, I remember that magnifying glasses use the concept of angular magnification, but more importantly, I think it involves the focal length and the object distance. Oh right, when using a magnifying glass, you need to have the object within the focal length of the lens to form a virtual image, which then can be focused by the eye. But wait, the person's near point is 25 cm, so the image must be formed at that near point for the most relaxed eye view.

Wait, no. The formula for magnifying glass is when the object is placed within the focal length. The image is virtual and upright, but the eye must be able to focus on it. So, the image must be at the near point of the eye, which is 25 cm. But wait, is the image formed at 25 cm? Or is the image virtual and the near point is where the eye can focus. I think for the magnifying glass, the object is placed such that the image is at the near point of the eye. So, the image distance (di) would be 25 cm. 

But wait, the formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Oh right, but for a magnifying glass, the object must be placed between the lens and the focal point, so do is less than f. So, let's plug in the numbers. Focal length f is 6 cm. The image distance di is 25 cm. So,

1/f = 1/do + 1/di
1/6 = 1/do + 1/25

I need to solve for do. Let me compute 1/6 and 1/25.

1/6 is approximately 0.1667, and 1/25 is 0.04. So,

0.1667 = 1/do + 0.04

Subtract 0.04 from both sides:

0.1267 = 1/do

So, do is about 1/0.1267, which is approximately 7.89 cm. Wait, but the options given are 4.84, 5, 6, etc. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Because I thought the image is formed at the near point, but maybe I have it backward. Wait, wait. Let me think again. When you're using a magnifying glass, the object should be placed so that the image forms at the near point of the eye. So, yes, di = 25 cm. But wait, if the focal length is 6 cm, and the image is at 25 cm, which is on the same side as the object? No, because if the object is within the focal length, the image would be virtual and on the same side as the object. Wait no, wait: the object is placed within the focal length for a converging lens, so the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So, when the object is between the lens and the focal point, the image is virtual, upright, and larger than the object.

But for the eye to focus properly, the image must be at the near point of the eye, which is 25 cm. So, the image distance is 25 cm. But wait, wait a second. The image is formed on the same side as the object, so the image distance di is negative? Because in the lens equation, distances are signed. So, for a converging lens, when the object is within the focal length, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object, so di is negative. So, di = -25 cm.

Wait, perhaps that's the key here. So, let's use the lens formula again:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di

Here, f = 6 cm, di = -25 cm.

So,

1/6 = 1/do + (1/(-25))
1/6 = 1/do - 1/25

Let me compute 1/6 and 1/25. 1/6 is approximately 0.1667, 1/25 is 0.04. So,

0.1667 = 1/do - 0.04

Adding 0.04 to both sides:

0.2067 = 1/do

So, do = 1 / 0.2067 â‰ˆ 4.847 cm.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4.84 cm, which matches approximately. So the correct answer would be C.

To determine the best position of the object for viewing an object using a magnifying glass with a focal length of 6 cm, where the person's smallest distance of distinct vision is 25 cm, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Here:
- \( f = 6 \, \text{cm} \) (focal length of the magnifying glass),
- \( d_i = -25 \, \text{cm} \) (image distance, negative because the image is virtual and on the same side as the object).

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{-25}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{d_o} - \frac{1}{25}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{25}
\]

Calculating:

\[
\frac{1}{d_o} = 0.1667 + 0.04 = 0.2067
\]

\[
d_o = \frac{1}{0.2067} \approx 4.84 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the best position of the object is approximately 4.84 cm from the lens. Among the given options, this corresponds to option C.
