Question:

A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease. It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug. A total of 600 individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial. Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?

Options:

A: Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
B: Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
C: Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
D: Individuals who take Drug X have six times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
E: Individuals who do not take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
F: Individuals who take Drug X have half the risk of dying from this type of cancer
G: Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer
H: Individuals who do not take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
I: Individuals who take Drug X have five times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
J: Individuals who take Drug X have zero risk of dying from this type of cancer

Okay, so I've got this question about relative risk in a medical trial. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. The scenario is a retrospective review of a trial where Drug X is used, and it's linked with increased cancer risk. They included 600 participants, with 200 taking the drug and 400 not. Then, 100 died from cancer in each group. I need to find the relative risk of death for those who took the drug compared to those who didn't.

Relative risk is the ratio of the risk in one group to the risk in another. So, it's (Risk in Group X) / (Risk in Group Y). Here, Group X is the ones who took the drug, Group Y is those who didn't.

First, let's calculate the death rates. For Group X (took drug): 100 deaths out of 200. That's 100/200 = 0.5 or 50%.

For Group Y (didn't take): 100 deaths out of 400. That's 25% or 0.25.

So, the relative risk is (0.5) / (0.25) = 2. That means the risk for those who took the drug is twice as high as those who didn't. 

Looking at the options, option A says individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk. That matches with our calculation. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the groups. 

Wait, did I get which group is which right? So, Group X is the ones who took the drug, and their death rate is higher than Group Y. So the relative risk is Group X divided by Group Y. Correct. So 50% /25% = 2. So, option A is correct.

Other options: B is four times, which would mean 100/400=0.25, but wait, no, that's for Group X. Wait, no: the relative is Group X / Group Y. So if I think about it, relative risk is X compared to Y. So Group X's death rate is 50% and Y's is 25%, so 50/25=2. So A is correct.

Other options: C is three times, which would be 100/400=25% (which is Group Y's death rate). No, that's not correct. D would be 100/400=25% for X, which is not twice. Wait, no. Wait: the relative is X's rate over Y's. So X is 50% and Y is 25%, so 50/25=2. So relative risk is 2 times. So option A is correct.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I got the denominator and numerator wrong. Oh wait, no. The formula is (risk in X) / (risk in Y). So if X is higher, the denominator is lower. So if X has 50% and Y 25%, 50/25 is 2. So A is correct.

To determine the relative risk of death from the type of cancer for individuals who take Drug X compared to those who do not, we calculate the death rates for each group and then find the ratio.

- **Group X (took Drug X):** 100 deaths out of 200 participants = 50% death rate.
- **Group Y (did not take Drug X):** 100 deaths out of 400 participants = 25% death rate.

The relative risk is calculated as:

\[
\text{Relative Risk} = \frac{\text{Risk in Group X}}{\text{Risk in Group Y}} = \frac{50\%}{25\%} = 2
\]

This means individuals who take Drug X have a relative risk of **two times** the risk of those who do not take the drug.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A:** Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk. ✔️ Correct.
- **B:** Four times the risk. ❌ Incorrect, as the ratio is 2.
- **C:** Three times the risk. ❌ Incorrect, as the ratio is 2.
- **D:** Six times the risk. ❌ Incorrect, as the ratio is 2.
- **E:** Three times the risk of dying for those who do not take the drug. ❌ Incorrect, as this is the inverse.
- **F:** Half the risk for those who take the drug. ❌ Incorrect, as the risk is higher.
- **G:** Equal risk. ❌ Incorrect, as there is a higher risk.
- **H:** Two times the risk of dying for those who do not take the drug. ❌ Incorrect, as this is the inverse.
- **I:** Five times the risk of dying for those who take the drug. ❌ Incorrect, as the risk is higher.
- **J:** Zero risk. ❌ Incorrect, as there is a significant risk.
