Okay, so I have this complex analysis problem to solve. The integral is from |z|=2 of (5z -2)/(z(z-1)) dz, and I need to compute its value. The answer options are various numbers with some with decimal points, so it's probably a complex integral that requires some residue theorem approach.

First, I remember that when integrating complex functions around a closed contour, the residue theorem is usually the way to go. So I need to find the residues inside the contour |z|=2.

Looking at the integrand, (5z -2)/(z(z-1)). The function is a rational function, so I can factor it as (5z-2)/(z(z-1)). The poles are at z=0 and z=1. The contour is |z|=2, which is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Both poles z=0 and z=1 lie inside this circle because 0 and 1 are less than 2 in modulus.

So I need to compute the residues at z=0 and z=1 and sum them.

Residue at z=0: Since z=0 is a simple pole, the residue is the limit as z approaches 0 of (5z-2)/(z(z-1)). Let me compute that.

Wait, simplifying, (5z-2)/(z(z-1)) can be rewritten as (5z-2)/(z(z-1)). So for z approaching 0, the numerator becomes (0 - 2) = -2, and the denominator approaches 0*(0-1) = 0. So the residue is the limit of (5z-2)/(z(z-1)) as z approaches 0.

Alternatively, since it's a simple pole, the residue can be found by taking the coefficient of 1/(z - a) in the Laurent series expansion around z = a. So here, a is 0.

So, the residue at z=0 is the limit as z approaches 0 of (5z -2)/(z(z-1)). Let me compute that:

lim z→0 [ (5z - 2) / (z(z-1)) ] = [ (0 -2) ] / [0 * (-1) ] = (-2)/(0) which is undefined. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor differently.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me compute it correctly. The expression is (5z - 2)/(z(z-1)). Let me compute the residue at z=0 by expanding the function as a Laurent series around z=0.

The function can be written as (5z - 2)/(z(z-1)). Let me separate this into partial fractions to find the residues more easily.

Let me write (5z -2) / (z(z -1)) as A/z + B/(z-1).

So, (5z -2) = A(z-1) + B z.

Expanding the right side: A z - A + B z = (A + B) z - A.

Set this equal to 5z -2. So:

A + B = 5    ...(from coefficients of z)

- A = -2      ...(constant term)

From the second equation, -A = -2 → A = 2.

Substituting into the first equation: 2 + B =5 → B=3.

So the partial fractions are 2/z + 3/(z-1).

So, the residue at z=0 is the coefficient of 1/z, which is 2.

Now, the residue at z=1. Similarly, since z=1 is a simple pole, the residue is the coefficient of 1/(z-1) in the expansion. But looking at our partial fraction, the term with 3/(z-1) has residue 3 at z=1.

Alternatively, the residue at z=1 is the coefficient of 1/(z-1) in the expansion, which is 3.

So summing the residues: Res(z=0) + Res(z=1) = 2 +3 =5.

But wait, no, that can't be right. Because the function is (5z-2)/(z(z-1)), and when we apply the residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. But wait, I'm integrating from |z|=2, so both poles are inside.

But wait, the function is (5z -2)/(z(z-1)).

Wait, wait, let me think again. The integral is ∮ (5z -2)/(z(z-1)) dz over |z|=2.

So residues at z=0 and z=1. We found residues at both are 2 and 3, respectively.

So sum is 2 +3 =5.

Multiply by 2πi: 2πi *5 =10πi.

Wait, but the options don't have any with i or π. The options are all real numbers. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the residue theorem.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the process. Wait, the integral is over a real function's complex integral. So the residue theorem says that the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues.

But wait, the options given are all real numbers, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the residues.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me compute the integral using another method.

Another approach: We can perform partial fraction decomposition:

(5z -2)/(z(z-1)) = A/z + B/(z-1).

As I did earlier, and got A=2, B=3. So the function is 2/z + 3/(z-1).

The integral over |z|=2 of (2/z +3/(z-1)) dz.

The integral of 1/z dz over a contour enclosing 0 is 2πi. Similarly, the integral of 1/(z-1) over |z|=2 is 2πi, since 1/(z-1) has a pole at z=1, which is inside the contour.

So the integral becomes 2*(2πi) +3*(2πi) = (2+3)*(2πi) =5*(2πi)=10πi.

But the options don't have any multiple of π, or any complex number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the integral as a real integral. Wait, no, the question is about complex integration.

Wait, maybe I should use the Cauchy integral formula. Wait, but both residues are simple.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the integral as the sum of two integrals.

But let me think again. The integral of 2/z is 2*2πi =4πi. The integral of 3/(z-1) is 3*2πi =6πi. So total is (4πi)+(6πi)=10πi.

But none of the options are in terms of π or i. So perhaps the question is intended to have a real integral, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fractions. Let me double-check.

Starting with (5z -2)/(z(z-1)).

Express as A/z + B/(z-1).

Multiply both sides by z(z-1):

5z -2 = A(z-1) + B z.

Expand: 5z -2 = (A + B)z - A.

Set coefficients equal:

A + B =5 (coefficient of z)

-A = -2 → A=2.

So B=3. So partial fractions are correct.

Residue at z=0 is A=2, at z=1 is B=3.

So sum is 5. Multiply by 2πi: 10πi.

But the options are all real numbers, so perhaps the question is expecting the magnitude or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the integral is over the real axis, but the function is complex. Wait, but the question says |z|=2, which is a circle in the complex plane. So perhaps the problem is to compute ∮ (5z -2)/(z(z-1)) dz where |z|=2.

Wait, but that would be 10πi. But that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the method.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider expanding the integrand into a Laurent series and integrating term by term.

Wait, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the residue theorem again, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the residues.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the integral by expanding the function as a power series around each pole and integrate term by term.

For z=0, the function is 2/z +3/(z-1). Let me write 3/(z-1) as -3/(1 - z) = -3 * sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n for |z|<1. But |z|=2 is outside this radius, so this expansion isn't valid here. Thus, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, but since the contour is |z|=2, which encloses both poles, perhaps I can't use the standard expansion for |z|>1.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the residue theorem correctly.

Wait, but no, the residues are correctly calculated as 2 and 3, sum is 5. So integral is 2πi *5 =10πi. So the options don’t have any complex number. So perhaps the problem is not correctly interpreted, or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is to compute the real integral of the real part or something, but no, the integrand is complex.

Wait, perhaps the question is a typo, and it's supposed to be (5z -2)/(z(z-1)) dz over a different contour. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial fraction.

Wait, let me try another way. Let me write (5z -2)/(z(z-1)) as (A/(z)) + (B/(z-1)).

Multiply both sides by z(z-1):

5z -2 = A(z-1) + B z.

At z=0: -2 = A(-1) → A=2.

At z=1: 5(1) -2 = B(1) → 3 = B.

So residues are 2 and 3, sum 5. Integral is 2πi *5 =10πi.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is expecting the magnitude of the integral. But 10πi has magnitude 10π, which is about 31.4 (since π ≈3.1416). 10 times π is approximately 31.416. So option C is 31.4, which is that. But the options are all real numbers, not including i.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial decomposition. Let me check:

(5z -2)/(z(z-1)) = (A/z) + (B/(z-1)).

Multiplying: (A(z-1) + B z) = A z - A + B z = (A+B)z -A.

Set equal to 5z -2:

A + B =5

-A = -2 → A=2.

So B=3. Correct.

So the residues are 2 and 3, sum 5. Integral is 10πi.

But the options don’t include i. So perhaps the problem is actually to compute ∮ (5z -2)/(z(z-1)) dz, but perhaps the integral is over the real axis, but the function is complex. Wait, but that would be a different integral, but the question states |z|=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the integral as a real integral, but that doesn't make sense because the integrand is complex.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the integral ∮ (5z -2)/(z(z-1)) dz over |z|=2. So, the function has poles at z=0 and z=1, both inside |z|=2.

Residues at z=0: as per partial fractions, 2.

Residue at z=1: 3.

Sum is 5. So integral is 2πi *5=10πi. 10π is approximately 31.4159, so 31.4 is an option (option C). So the answer would be 31.4, which is option C.

But I'm a bit confused because the options are all real numbers, but the integral is a complex number (10πi). Unless I'm misapplying the residue theorem.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral as the sum of the integrals over each residue, but in terms of real and imaginary parts. But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and the integral is real, but in that case, the integrand would have to be real on the contour. But since the function is complex, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the partial fractions again. Let me compute (5z-2)/(z(z-1)) as A/z + B/(z-1).

Wait, when I set it up, I get A=2 and B=3, so (2/z) + (3/(z-1)).

So the function is 2/z + 3/(z-1). The integral is ∮ [2/z + 3/(z-1)] dz = 2∮(1/z)dz + 3∮(1/(z-1))dz.

Each integral is 2πi, so 2*(2πi) +3*(2πi) = 10πi.

So, the integral is 10πi, which is approximately 31.4159i. But the options are all real numbers. So perhaps the question is intended to have a different function, or perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the original problem was to compute the integral of the real part or the imaginary part, but that’s not what's written. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a real integral, but the function is complex, so that's not applicable.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. But given the options, and the fact that the integral is 10πi, which is about 31.4, the closest option is C) 31.4. So I think the answer is C.

The problem requires computing the integral ∮₆ |z|=2 (5z - 2)/(z(z - 1)) dz using the residue theorem. The integrand has simple poles at z=0 and z=1, both inside the contour |z|=2. 

1. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**:  
   Decompose (5z - 2)/(z(z - 1)) as A/z + B/(z - 1). Solving for A and B gives A=2 and B=3. Thus, the function becomes 2/z + 3/(z - 1).

2. **Residues**:  
   - Residue at z=0 (simple pole): The coefficient of 1/z is 2.
   - Residue at z=1 (simple pole): The coefficient of 1/(z - 1) is 3.

3. **Sum of Residues**:  
   The sum of the residues is 2 + 3 = 5.

4. **Integral Calculation**:  
   Using the residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues.  
   ∮ (5z - 2)/(z(z - 1)) dz = 2πi * 5 = 10πi.

5. **Magnitude of the Integral**:  
   The magnitude of the integral is |10πi| ≈ 10π ≈ 31.4159. Among the options, the closest match is **31.4**.
