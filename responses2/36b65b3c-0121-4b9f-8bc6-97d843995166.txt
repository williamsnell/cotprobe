Question:

A grantor conveyed his property to his son "for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs. " Two years later, the son entered into a real estate agreement for the sale of the property to his friend, whereby the son agreed to convey the premises to his friend in fee simple absolute. Prior to the settlement date, the friend contacted the son, telling him that he would not perform his part of the agreement because the son could not convey a fee simple. If the Rule in Shelley's Case is followed in this jurisdiction, the outcome of a suit by the son for specific performance of the real estate contract would result in

Options:

A: the son's succeeding, because the son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs.
B: the son's not succeeding, because his heirs have to join in the transaction in order to convey marketable title.
C: the son's succeeding, because the son's life estate merged with the contingent remainder to his heirs, creating a fee simple.
D: the son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.
E: the son's not succeeding, because he could not convey marketable title.
F: the son's not succeeding, because the Rule in Shelley's Case invalidates the remainder to his heirs.
G: the son's not succeeding, as the friend was correct in asserting that the son could not convey a fee simple.
H: the son's succeeding, as the grantor's initial conveyance was implicitly in fee simple absolute.
I: the son's not succeeding, as the property was only granted to him for life.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically about remainders and specific performance. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a grant that the son made to his father's property. The conveyance was "for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs." Then, two years later, the son signed a real estate sale agreement. He agreed to sell the property to his friend, but the son couldn't convey it because he couldn't take fee simple. So, someone sued the son for specific performance, and we have to apply the Rule in Shelley's Case to determine the outcome.

I remember that in property law, when a grantor leaves a remainder to someone's heirs, it's a remainder, which is a remainder interest. However, if the grantor can't fulfill their part, as in this case, the remainder might not take effect. 

Shelley's Case is about how remainders are treated when the grantor can't convey the remainder. The rule says that if a grantor cannot fulfill their interest, the remainder doesn't pass to the heirs. So, in this case, the son couldn't convey fee simple because he couldn't take it. So the remainder would not go to his heirs, meaning the heirs (the son's heirs) wouldn't get the property.

Wait, but the grant was for life, remainder after the son's death. So the son's life estate to his father was for life. But the remainder to the son's heirs would have been determined by whether the grantor (son) could convey the remainder.

In the deed, the son conveyed it to his friend, but the son couldn't convey fee simple. So, according to the Rule in Shelley's Case, the remainder doesn't go to the heirs. Thus, the son's heirs would not get the property.

Looking at the options, let's see what each says.

Option A: The son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs. Hmm, I'm not sure. Divesting the remainder might not be correct because the remainder is a separate interest. The son's life estate and the remainder are separate, but the remainder's interest would go to the son's heirs if the grantor couldn't convey it.

Option B: The son's not succeeding because he had to join in. That doesn't make sense. The remainder doesn't pass to the heirs unless the grantor can't perform. So the heirs wouldn't take title, so the son wouldn't get the property.

Option C: The son's success because the life estate merged with the remainder. That's probably not right. The life estate is separate from the remainder, so their interests don't merge. The remainder doesn't go to the heirs if the grantor couldn't convey it.

Option D: Son succeeded because he had fee simple. No, the fee simple was to the son. But the remainder was to his heirs, which might not pass. So the son's fee simple isn't affected, but the remainder doesn't go to his heirs.

Option E: Son not succeeding because couldn't convey. That's what the Rule in Shelley's Case says. The remainder doesn't pass, so the heirs don't get the property. So the son can't take the property, so the son doesn't succeed.

Option F: Son not because Shelley's invalid. No, the Rule applies regardless, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Son succeeded because grantor's conveyance was implicit in fee simple. But the grantor was conveying fee simple, so that's correct. But wait, the remainder to the son's heirs might not pass. So G is correct in that sense, but the outcome depends on the remainder passing.

Option H: Son succeeded because grantor's conveyance was implicitly fee simple absolute. That's correct in that the grantor conveyed fee simple, but again, the remainder might not pass. So if the remainder doesn't pass, the son can't take title, so he can't perform the contract. So the suit would fail in favor of the grantor, so the son wouldn't succeed.

Looking back at the question: the suit is by the son for specific performance. If the remainder doesn't go to his heirs, then the son can't take title, so he can't perform. Therefore, the son can't perform the contract, so the suit fails.

So the correct answer is E: the son's not succeeding, because he couldn't convey a fee simple.

Wait, but let me double-check. The grant was for life, so the son's life estate is to the son, not his heirs. The remainder is to the son's heirs if the grantor can't convey it. So in this case, the son couldn't convey fee simple, so the remainder doesn't go to his heirs. Therefore, the son's heirs don't get the property, meaning the son can't perform the contract. So the suit by the son for specific performance is unsuccessful, so he doesn't succeed.

So the answer is E.
</think>

The son's conveyance of his life estate to his friend was for fee simple, but the Rule in Shelley's Case dictates that if the grantor cannot fulfill their interest (in this case, conveying a fee simple), the remainder does not pass to the heirs. Since the son could not convey fee simple, the remainder to his heirs does not go to the son's estate. Consequently, the son's heirs do not acquire the property, and he cannot perform the contract as required. This means the suit by the son for specific performance is unsuccessful.
