Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about demand curves. Let me think through what I remember about this.

The question says that Matt's total utility from bratwurst increases at a constant rate, no matter how many he consumes. And the question is about what his demand curve would look like.

Hmm, total utility and marginal utility. Total utility is the sum of all utilities from each unit consumed. If it's increasing at a constant rate, that would mean the marginal utility is constant. Because marginal utility is the additional utility from each additional unit. So if each more bratwurst gives the same increase in total utility, then the marginal utility is the same for each unit.

Wait, so if the marginal utility is the same, then what's the demand curve like? The demand curve relates price to quantity demanded. From my notes, when marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is linear. Because when you have constant marginal utility, the slope of the total utility curve is constant, which in economics terms is a straight line. So the demand curve, which is the inverse of the marginal utility curve (since higher prices lead to lower quantity demanded), would also be a straight line.

Wait, let me think again. The marginal utility curve is the derivative of total utility. If the total utility is linear, meaning it increases at a constant rate, then the marginal utility would be constant. The demand curve is the quantity demanded at each price. For a linear demand curve (perfectly elastic), the quantity demanded doesn't change much with price, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, if the marginal utility is constant, the marginal utility curve is a horizontal line. The demand curve is the inverse of that, which would be a vertical line because as price increases, quantity demanded would drop to zero. Wait, no, that's when marginal utility is decreasing. If marginal utility is constant, then the inverse demand curve would be a horizontal line because quantity demanded doesn't change with price—so the curve would be vertical.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say the total utility function is linear, like TU = a - bQ. Then, the marginal utility (MU) is the derivative, which is -b. So MU is constant. The demand curve is Q = (a - TU)/b, because TU is a linear function. So TU = a - bQ → a = TU + bQ. So when price is p, the quantity demanded is Q = (a - p)/b. But since a and b are constants, Q = (a/b) - (p/b). So Q = (a/b) - (p/b). Wait, but if p increases, Q decreases. So the demand curve is Q = (a/b) - (p/b), which is a straight line in terms of price and quantity. That's a straight line, so it's a straight line demand curve.

Wait, but another way to think about it: if marginal utility is constant, then the price-marginal utility ratio is the same at all quantities. So for each unit, the price is higher by a fixed amount. So as the price increases, the amount demanded decreases linearly. So the demand curve is a straight line, which is a linear demand curve, which would look like a straight line. So the demand curve's shape depends on the relationship between price and quantity. If the price is inversely proportional to quantity, the curve is a straight line. 

So in this question, since the marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is linear. So the answer should be A: Linearly increasing? Wait, no. Wait, the demand curve is linear if price and quantity are inversely related linearly. So it's a straight line, which is a linear demand curve. So the correct answer would be A, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me consider another angle. The demand curve is plotted with price on the y-axis and quantity on the x-axis. If the demand curve is linear, it's a straight line. The slope could be positive or negative. But in this case, when price increases, quantity demanded decreases. So the slope is negative. But the question is about the overall shape. The options don't have a negative linear. Let's look again.

Options:

A: Linearly increasing → no, because that's a positive slope, which would mean higher prices lead to higher quantities. Not our case.

B: Inverted U-shape → U-shape suggests that demand increases, then decreases. But with constant marginal utility, demand should be zero beyond a certain point, so perhaps a horizontal curve.

Wait, no, if marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is linear, which is a straight line. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, another approach. For perfect inelasticity, demand is constant. If marginal utility is constant, then each additional unit gives the same additional utility. So the marginal utility is constant, so the demand curve is linear. So the demand curve is a straight line, which is a linear demand curve, which is option A.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the options. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: Linearly increasing → slope positive.

B: Inverted U-shape → perhaps non-linear, like convex, which would be when marginal utility is decreasing.

C: Horizontal → that's when demand is independent of price, which would require that marginal utility is zero, which is not the case here.

D: Upward sloping → slope positive, which is the opposite of what we have.

E: Vertical → when quantity demanded doesn't depend on price (perfectly inelastic), which is not the case here.

F: Zigzag → might be from perfect elasticity, which isn't the case.

G: Downward sloping → negative slope.

H: Exponentially increasing → would have a steeper curve, not the case here.

I: Parabolic → U-shaped, again for when marginal utility is decreasing.

J: U-shaped → again for when demand increases with price, then decreases.

Wait, but if marginal utility is constant, the demand curve should be a straight line, which is a linear demand curve. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait: when marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is linear. So the correct answer should be A: Linearly increasing — no, wait, option A says linearly increasing, which would have a positive slope. But in this case, the demand curve is downward sloping, so it's a straight line with a negative slope. So that would be a negative linear demand curve, which is a straight line.

Wait, but the options don't have an option for a negative linear. So perhaps the correct answer is A: Linearly increasing, but I'm getting confused about the positive or negative slope.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the demand curve is linear, but in the case of constant marginal utility, the demand curve is a straight line with a negative slope. So the answer would be a straight line, which is a linear demand curve, so option A.

Wait, but looking back, the question is about the demand curve. So the correct answer is a linear demand curve, which is option A. Or no, because when marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is linear, with a negative slope. So the answer is a straight line, which is option A. So the correct answer is A.

The question asks about the shape of Matt's demand curve when his total utility increases at a constant rate with each additional bratwurst. Since marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is linear. This is because when marginal utility is constant, the demand curve is a straight line with a negative slope, representing an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. Among the options provided, the correct description of the demand curve is a linearly increasing line, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
