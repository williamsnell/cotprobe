Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Hume's views on morality. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what Hume considers morality to be ultimately based on. The options are A through J, each with different ideas. I remember that Hume was a philosopher, probably from the Enlightenment, and he wrote a book called "The Five Laws of Morality." But I'm not too sure about all the details.

Wait, I think Hume's main arguments were about the nature of causality and ethics being a part of scientific knowledge. He believed that morality is a normative science, not something that's discovered through reason. So he probably didn't think it's based on cultural norms or social agreements. Instead, he thought about principles that could govern human behavior, like the five laws.

Looking at the options, A is cultural norms. I don't think Hume agreed with that because he was more critical of social norms as the basis of morality. B is social agreements, which I don't think he held either. C is reason. Hume's view was that reason alone can't explain morality because it's about the mind's capacity for right and wrong, not just logical deductions.

D is personal beliefs. That's more in line with Hume's later thoughts, where he believed that morality is a product of human nature, influenced by personal emotions. But the question is about his initial understanding.

E is individual experiences. Hume might have thought that morality is shaped by what we've experienced, but it's not the ultimate or most fundamental aspect.

F is scientific facts. No, because he's more about the principles than observable data.

G is God’s commands. I don't think that's Hume's point either. His work doesn't mention God or any divine authority.

H is self-interest. That's more about the pursuit of gain, not necessarily about the nature of morality itself.

I'm not sure about J, sympathy or emotional responses. Maybe Hume considered emotional responses as part of morality, but I think he's more focused on the principles than the emotional basis.

Putting it all together, Hume's main idea was that morality is a set of universal principles that guide human behavior, which can be learned and understood through reason. So the correct answer should be C: reason.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that Hume's later work did include some emotional or personal elements, but the question is about his initial understanding. So the answer should be C, right?

The correct answer is C: reason. Hume's view on morality centers around the idea that it is a normative science, governed by principles that can be learned and understood through reason. His initial understanding emphasizes reason over cultural norms, social agreements, scientific facts, or personal beliefs, aligning with the principles that could govern human behavior. 

Answer: C
