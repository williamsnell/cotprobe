Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrostatic force between two ions. Hmm, I remember that Coulomb's Law is involved for this kind of problem. Coulomb's Law says that the force between two point charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 

The formula is F = k * (q1 * q2) / r², right? Where k is Coulomb's constant, which I think is about 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². Oh wait, sometimes it's approximated as 9e9 for simplicity.

The problem says the two ions are identical. So q1 and q2 should be the same. Let me note that down: q1 = q2 = q. So the formula simplifies to F = k * q² / r². I can rearrange this to solve for q. 

So solving for q, I get q = sqrt( (F * r²) / k ). Or wait, more accurately, q = sqrt( (F * r²) / k ). Because F is given.

Let me plug the numbers in. F is 3.7e-9 N. The distance r is 5.0e-10 meters. Coulomb's constant k is about 9e9 N·m²/C².

So first, compute r squared. r is 5e-10 m, so r squared is (5e-10)^2. 5 squared is 25, and 1e-10 squared is 1e-20. So r² is 25e-20 m², which is 2.5e-19 m².

Now, plug into F * r²: 3.7e-9 N * 2.5e-19 m². Let me calculate that. 3.7 * 2.5 is about 9.25, and exponents are 10^-9 *10^-19 = 10^-28. So 9.25e-28.

Now divide by k: 9.25e-28 / 9e9. Let me compute that. 9.25 divided by 9 is roughly 1.0278. So approximately 1.0278e-37 (since 10^-28 / 10^9 is 10^-37). 

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me re-calculate. Oh no, wait, 3.7e-9 *2.5e-19 = (3.7*2.5) *1e-28. 3.7 *2.5 is 9.25. So that's 9.25e-28.

Divide by k: which is 9e9. So 9.25e-28 /9e9 = (9.25 /9 ) * (1e-28 /1e9) )= approximately 1.0278 * 1e-37 = 1.0278e-37.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me compute 3.7e-9 * (5e-10)^2. 5e-10 squared is 25e-20. 3.7e-9 *25e-20 = (3.7 *25) *1e-29. 3.7 *25 is 92.5, so 92.5e-29.

Wait, wait a second, 3.7e-9 * 2.5e-19 is 3.7 * 2.5 = 9.25, and 1e-9 *1e-19 = 1e-28. So the product is 9.25e-28.

Divide by 9e9: 9.25e-28 /9e9 = (9.25 /9) * 1e-37. 9.25 /9 is approximately 1.0278. So 1.0278e-37.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because then q squared is 1.0278e-37.

Wait, no, wait, no! Oh wait, I think the mistake is in the exponents. Let me recalculate the exponents correctly.

r = 5e-10 m. So r squared is (5e-10)^2 = 25e-20 m². So:

F * r² = 3.7e-9 N * 25e-20 m² = (3.7 *25) * 1e-29 = 92.5e-29 = 9.25e-28.

Wait, 3.7e-9 * 25e-20 is 3.7 *25 = 92.5, and exponents: 1e-9 * 1e-20 = 1e-29. So that's 92.5e-29, which is 9.25e-28.

Then, F*r²/k = 9.25e-28 / 9e9 = (9.25 /9 ) * 1e-37. 9.25 /9 is approximately 1.0278.

So q squared is 1.0278e-37.

So q is sqrt(1.0278e-37) = sqrt(1.0278) * sqrt(1e-37). sqrt(1e-37) is 1e-18.5. Because sqrt(1e-37) is (1e-37)^(1/2) = 1e-18.5 = 1e-18 * 1e-0.5.

Wait, 1e-0.5 is approximately 0.3162. So 1e-18.5 is 1e-18 * 0.3162 = 3.162e-19.

Wait, but wait, let me compute sqrt(1.0278) which is about 1.0138. So approximately 1.0138 * 3.162e-19.

Wait, 1e-18 * 3.162e-19 would be 3.162e-37, no, wait, no. Wait, sqrt(1e-37) is 1e-18.5, which is the same as 10^-18.5 = approx 3.162e-19.

So 1.0138 *3.162e-19 is approximately 3.198e-19 C.

Wait, but wait, let me get that exact calculation right. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, q squared is 1.0278e-37.

So q = sqrt(1.0278e-37). Let's compute that.

Square root of 1.0278 is about 1.0138. Square root of 1e-37 is 1e-18.5. Because 1e-37 is 10^(-37), and sqrt(10^-37) is 10^(-37/2) = 10^(-18.5).

So 10^(-18.5) is same as 1e-18 * 1e-0.5. 1e-0.5 is about 0.3162. So 1e-18 * 0.3162 = 3.162e-19.

So sqrt(1.0278e-37) = sqrt(1.0278) * sqrt(1e-37) = 1.0138 * 3.162e-19.

Wait, 1.0138 * 3.162 is approximately 3.216. Because 3.162 *1 is 3.162, 3.162 *0.0138 is about 0.0434. So total is about 3.2054.

So q is approximately 3.2054e-19 coulombs.

Looking at the options, option F is 3.2e-19 C. Which is very close to what I got.

Wait, but wait, maybe I messed up the exponents somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me recast the calculation without approximating.

F = 3.7e-9 N

r =5e-10 m

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So F = k q² / r² → q² = (F r²) / k.

Compute r squared: (5e-10)^2 =25e-20 m².

Multiply F by r squared: 3.7e-9 *25e-20 = (3.7 *25) *1e-29 = 92.5e-29 = 9.25e-28.

Divide by k: 9.25e-28 /8.988e9 = (9.25 /8.988) * 1e-37.

9.25 /8.988 is approximately 1.0278.

So q² = 1.0278e-37.

So q = sqrt(1.0278e-37) = sqrt(1.0278) * sqrt(1e-37).

sqrt(1e-37) is 1e-18.5 = approximately 3.162e-19.

So 1.0278 * 3.162e-19 = let's compute that more accurately.

1.0278 *3.162 = 1 *3.162 is 3.162, plus 0.0278 *3.162.

0.0278 *3.162 ≈ 0.0879.

So total is about 3.162 + 0.0879 = 3.2499.

So q² = about 3.25e-19. So q is sqrt(3.25e-19) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, I think I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, q squared is 1.0278e-37. So sqrt(1.0278e-37) is sqrt(1.0278) * sqrt(1e-37).

Wait, sqrt(1e-37) = 1e-18.5, which is approx 3.162e-19 (since 1e-18 * 1e-0.5 = 1e-18 * ~0.3162).

So 1.0278 *3.162e-19 = (1.0278 *3.162) * 1e-19.

Wait wait, wait, no, wait. Because 1e-18.5 is same as 1e-19 * 1e-0.5, which is 1e-19 * 0.3162.

So sqrt(1e-37) = 1e-18.5 = 3.162e-19.

So q = (1.0278) * (3.162e-19) / sqrt(1e-37) ?

Wait, no, no. Wait, sqrt(1e-37) is same as 1e-18.5, which is 3.162e-19.

So 1.0278 *3.162e-19 = let's compute 1.0278 *3.162.

I'll compute 1 *3.162 =3.162, 0.0278 *3.162 ≈ 0.0879.

So total is about 3.2499e-19.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because that would make q about 3.25e-19 C, which matches option F (3.2e-19) approximately.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is 3.2e-19. But let me get more precise.

Wait, let me compute 1.0278 *3.162.

Hmm, 3.162 *1.0278 = ?

Let me compute 3.162 *1.0278.

3.162 *1 =3.162.

3.162 *0.0278 = 0.0879 (since 3.162 *0.02 = 0.06324; 3.162 *0.0078 = approx 0.0245, so total is 0.0877).

So 3.162 + 0.0877 = 3.2497.

So 3.2497e-19 C. Wait, but the options have option F as 3.2e-19, which is 3.20e-19. So that's very close.

But wait, the options: looking back, option F is 3.2e-19. So the correct answer is F.

But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact steps.

Let me redo the calculation.

F = 3.7e-9 N.

r =5e-10 m.

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, q² = (F * r² ) / k.

Compute r squared: (5e-10)^2 =25e-20 m².

F * r² =3.7e-9 *25e-20 = (3.7 *25) * 1e-29 = 92.5e-29 =9.25e-28.

Divide by k: q² =9.25e-28 /8.988e9 = (9.25 /8.988) ) *1e-37.

9.25 /8.988 is approx 1.0278.

So q²=1.0278e-37.

Take square root: q = sqrt(1.0278) * sqrt(1e-37).

Wait, sqrt(1e-37) is 1e-18.5, which is approx 3.162e-19.

So 1.0278 *3.162e-19 = (1.0278 *3.162) *1e-19.

Wait, 1.0278 *3.162 is 3.162 + 0.0278*3.162.

0.0278 *3 is 0.0834, 0.0278 *0.162 is approx 0.0045156.

So 0.0834 + 0.0045156 = 0.0879156.

So 3.162 + 0.0879156 =3.2499156.

So q = 3.2499e-19 C ≈3.25e-19 C.

But the options are:

A:1e-19

B:4.2e-19

C:2e-18

D:3.6e-19

E:1.6e-19

F:3.2e-19

G:4.8e-19

H:2.8e-19

I:6.4e-19

J:5e-19.

So option F is 3.2e-19, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but doesn't that answer match option F? So the correct answer is F.

To solve the problem, we use Coulomb's Law, which states:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2}
\]

Since the ions are identical, \( q_1 = q_2 = q \). Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q^2}{r^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( q \):

\[
q = \sqrt{\frac{F \cdot r^2}{k}}
\]

### Step 1: Plug in the values
- \( F = 3.7 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{N} \)
- \( r = 5.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)

First, calculate \( r^2 \):

\[
r^2 = (5.0 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 25 \times 10^{-20} = 2.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Next, calculate \( F \cdot r^2 \):

\[
F \cdot r^2 = (3.7 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot (2.5 \times 10^{-19}) = (3.7 \cdot 2.5) \times 10^{-28} = 9.25 \times 10^{-28}
\]

Now, divide by \( k \):

\[
\frac{F \cdot r^2}{k} = \frac{9.25 \times 10^{-28}}{8.988 \times 10^9} = \frac{9.25}{8.988} \cdot 10^{-37} \approx 1.0278 \cdot 10^{-37}
\]

Finally, take the square root to find \( q \):

\[
q = \sqrt{1.0278 \cdot 10^{-37}} = \sqrt{1.0278} \cdot \sqrt{10^{-37}}
\]

- \( \sqrt{1.0278} \approx 1.0138 \)
- \( \sqrt{10^{-37}} = 10^{-18.5} = 10^{-18} \cdot 10^{-0.5} = 10^{-18} \cdot 0.3162 = 3.162 \times 10^{-19} \)

Thus:

\[
q = 1.0138 \cdot 3.162 \times 10^{-19} \approx 3.2499 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}
\]

### Step 2: Match with the options
The calculated value \( q \approx 3.25 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) is closest to option **F: 3.2 × 10⁻¹⁹ C**.

ANSWER: F
