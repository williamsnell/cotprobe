Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution. The solution is 0.10 M HOAc, which I think is formic acid. And it's dissolved in 0.20 M NaOAc, which I believe is sodium acetate. The dissociation constant of HOAc is given as 1.75 × 10^-5. 

Wait, wait. I should make sure I remember the dissociation. Formic acid, HOAc, is a weak acid. Its conjugate base would be OAc^- (acetate ion). Sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte, so it completely dissociates into Na+ and OAc^-.

So the solution is a buffer solution because it has both a weak acid (HOAc) and its conjugate base (acetate from NaOAc). Buffer solutions use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, right? The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]), where A^- is the conjugate base and HA is the weak acid.

First, I need to find the pKa. The dissociation constant, Ka, of HOAc is 1.75e-5. So pKa is the negative log of that. Let me calculate that. 

pKa = -log(1.75e-5) 

Hmm, I'll break it down. Log(1e-5) is 5, so log(1.75e-5) is log(1.75) -5. Log(1.75) is approximately 0.243, so 0.243 -5 is -4.757. So pKa is 4.757.

Now I can plug into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The concentrations: [HA] is 0.10 M (HOAc), [A^-] is 0.20 M (acetate) because NaOAc is 0.20 M and it dissociates completely.

So pH = 4.757 + log(0.20/0.10). 

Let's compute 0.20 divided by 0.10. That's 2. So the log of 2 is approximately 0.3010.

So pH = 4.757 + 0.3010 = 5.058. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is 5.07, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I mix up the acid and base? Henderson-Hasselbalch uses [A^-]/[HA], right. So if the acid is HOAc (HA) and the conjugate base is OAc^- (A^-), then yes, [A^-]/[HA] is 0.2/0.1 = 2. So that's correct.

Another thought: sometimes I get confused about which is which, but I think that's right. No, wait, no, the formula is [A^-]/[HA], so [0.2]/[0.1] is 2. So that's correct.

So the pH should be approximately 5.06, which is 5.07. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the pH of a 0.10 M HOAc solution containing 0.20 M NaOAc, we recognize that this is a buffer solution consisting of a weak acid (HOAc, formic acid) and its conjugate base (acetate ion, OAc⁻). The dissociation constant \( K_a \) of formic acid is \( 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \), and the pKa is calculated as:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(K_a) = -\log(1.75 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.757
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)
\]

Here, \([\text{HA}] = 0.10 \, \text{M}\) (formic acid) and \([\text{A}^-] = 0.20 \, \text{M}\) (acetate ion). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.757 + \log\left(\frac{0.20}{0.10}\right)
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 4.757 + \log(2) \approx 4.757 + 0.301 = 5.058
\]

The closest option to this calculated pH of 5.058 is **5.07**.
