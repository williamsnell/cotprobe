Okay, so I have this question about Hirschsprung's disease. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking which statement is incorrect. Let's go through each option to figure it out.

First, I remember that Hirschsprung's disease is caused by a genetic disorder. It's one of the more common genetic disorders, especially affecting children. The disease is associated with Down syndrome and can lead to developmental issues.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Recurrence risks are higher for long segment diseases than short ones. I think I read that Hirschsprung's disease has a higher risk in long segment cases. So if A says recurrence is worse for long, that would be correct. So A is correct, meaning the incorrect statement isn't A.

Option B: More common in girls than boys. I remember that girls have a higher incidence of Hirschsprung's disease. So B is correct, so the wrong statement isn't B.

Option C: Can be diagnosed through a routine blood test. No, I think Hirschsprung's is more of a genetic condition, not something easily diagnoseable. So C is incorrect. But wait, I need to check all options.

Option D: Primarily affects the digestive system. Yes, that's correct. Hirschsprung's affects the digestive tract, leading to changes in the lining of the digestive system.

Option E: Associated with Down syndrome. Yes, Hirschsprung's has a high incidence in individuals with Down syndrome. So E is correct.

Option F: Not associated with any genetic factors. No, it is associated with genetic factors. So F is incorrect. But wait, I thought F was correct because the statement says "not associated with any genetic factors". So F is incorrect, which would make it the answer if F were incorrect.

Option G: Primarily affects adults. No, Hirschsprung's is more common in children. So G is incorrect.

Option H: No difference in recurrence risks between long and short. If A is correct, H is wrong, making H the incorrect statement. But I'm getting mixed up.

Option I: Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. I think Hirschsprung's is more common in children with Down syndrome, but I don't recall if it's linked with autism. Maybe they share some genetic traits, but I don't think it's a direct association. So I'm not sure about I, but perhaps it's incorrect.

Option J: RET is a major susceptibility gene. I believe RET is a heritable susceptibility gene for Down syndrome, but Hirschsprung's is associated with a different gene. So J is incorrect.

Wait, let me try to recap. The question is which statement is incorrect.

So, let's go through each option again.

A: Recurrence risk higher for long segments. Correct. So A is correct, so the incorrect statement isn't A.

B: More common in girls. Correct. So incorrect statement isn't B.

C: Routine blood test. Incorrect. So C is the incorrect statement. But wait, let me check the other options because maybe another is incorrect.

D: Primary effect is digestive. Correct. So D is correct.

E: Associated with Down. Correct.

F: Not genetic factors. Incorrect. So F is incorrect. So F is a wrong statement.

G: Primarily affects adults. Incorrect. So G is incorrect.

H: No difference in recurrence risks. If A is correct, H is wrong.

I: Related to Autism. Not sure, but I think the link is weak. So I might be incorrect, but not sure.

J: RET is a major gene. Correct.

So looking for the incorrect statement. The options are A to J.

Which of these is incorrect?

Option C: Can be diagnosed via a routine blood test. I thought this was incorrect. Hirschsprung's is more about genetic testing rather than blood tests. So C is incorrect.

Wait, but let me think again. If the question is about which statement is incorrect, then each option is a statement.

Looking at F: It is not associated with any genetic factors. That's incorrect because it is associated with genetic factors. So F is wrong.

Wait, so F is incorrect. So if F is the incorrect statement, then which option is the answer?

Wait, the question is asking which statement is incorrect.

Looking back, the options are A to J. So the incorrect statement is F.

Alternatively, option H says there's no difference in recurrence risks between long and short. That's the opposite of A. So H is incorrect because if A is right, H is wrong.

Wait, but I thought H is incorrect.

Wait, let's reevaluate each option's correctness.

C: Can be diagnosed through a routine blood test. I thought this is incorrect. Because Hirschsprung's is a genetic disorder, not something that can be diagnosed through a blood test. So C is incorrect.

F: Not associated with any genetic factors. That's incorrect because Hirschsprung's is associated with genetic factors.

So both C and F are incorrect? But the options are single choice.

Wait, no, each option is a statement, and I have to choose one.

But the question is to select the incorrect statement. So which of them is incorrect.

Wait, the options are asking which is incorrect. So all of them are statements except none are incorrect, but the question is which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think again.

Option F: It is not associated with any genetic factors. No, it is. So F is incorrect.

Option C: Can be diagnosed via a routine blood test. I think that's incorrect because it's genetic, not a blood test. So C is incorrect.

Wait, but which is the incorrect statement? The question is which statement is wrong.

So, both C and F could be incorrect, but the question is which is incorrect among options A-F, G, etc.

Wait, no, let me think again.

The question is, which of the statements is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statement is the one that's wrong.

So, let's go through each option:

A: Correct. Long segments have higher recurrence.

B: Correct. More in girls.

C: Incorrect. Not routine blood.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Incorrect. It is associated with genetic factors.

G: Incorrect. Primarily affects adults.

H: Incorrect. Recurrence difference.

I: Incorrect. No direct link.

J: Correct.

So, the incorrect statements are C, F, G, H, I.

Which of these is the answer. The question asks for the incorrect statement.

The question is which is incorrect, so multiple may be incorrect. But the options are single letter.

Wait, but looking at the options, the question is which statement is incorrect. The options are A to J.

So, the incorrect statements are C, F, G, H, I.

But the question is only asking for one incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating F. Let me think again.

Option F: It is not associated with any genetic factors. That's false. So F is incorrect.

Option C: Can be diagnosed via a routine blood test. That's incorrect. So C is incorrect.

Wait, so the options are single answers, so the question is which is incorrect, but I have multiple incorrect options. But the question is phrased as "which of the following statements is incorrect?"

Wait, but I'm supposed to pick only one letter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check each option again.

Option F: It is not associated with any genetic factors. No, it is, because it's heritable. So F is incorrect.

Option C: Can be diagnosed via a routine blood test. No because itâ€™s genetic. So C is incorrect.

So, two incorrect statements: C and F.

But the question asks for which is incorrect, but the options are single letter. So I need to see what the actual correct answer is.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me recheck.

The options are:

A: Recurrence risks are higher for long segment disease than for short segment disease.

B: More common in girls than in boys.

C: It can be diagnosed through a routine blood test.

D: It is a disease that primarily affects the digestive system.

E: It shows an association with Down syndrome.

F: It is not associated with any genetic factors.

G: It is a disease that primarily affects adults.

H: There is no difference in recurrence risks between long segment and short segment disease.

I: It shows an association with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

J: RET is a major susceptibility gene.

So, which is incorrect.

The question is, which of these is incorrect. So the incorrect statement is F and C.

But the options are single letters. So perhaps I have to choose the incorrect one. The question is, which statement is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I need to look for the incorrect statement. So, which is incorrect? Let's see:

A: Correct.

B: Correct.

C: Incorrect. Because Hirschsprung's is genetic, not a blood test. So C is incorrect.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Incorrect, because it is associated with genetic factors.

G: Incorrect, because it's not for adults.

H: Incorrect, because recurrence risk difference exists.

I: Incorrect, but not sure.

J: Incorrect, because it's not RET.

So, the question is which is incorrect. So, it could be C, F, G, H, I.

But the options are single letter, so perhaps the correct answer is F. Or perhaps C is incorrect. But the question might have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps looking for the incorrect statement among the options.

The Hirschsprung's disease is a genetic disorder, so option C is incorrect because it's not diagnosed by blood tests. So C is an incorrect statement.

Another approach: the question is about which statement is incorrect. Let's think which one is wrong.

Option F: It is not associated with any genetic factors. That's wrong because it is. So F is incorrect.

Option C: Can be diagnosed via a routine blood test. That's incorrect.

So, perhaps both C and F are incorrect. But the question expects only one answer. So among the options, the incorrect statement is F.

Wait, the options are given as letters, so I have to choose one.

Wait, but the question is about which is incorrect. So, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I thought F is incorrect because Hirschsprung's is associated with genetic factors. So F is incorrect.

Wait, but another way: The question asks, which is incorrect, so the answer could be F.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think.

Wait, the options are A to J. The incorrect one is F.

Wait, but looking again, option F says "It is not associated with any genetic factors." The correct statement is that it is associated with genetic factors, so F is incorrect.

So, the incorrect statement is F.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following... is incorrect," so F is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but I'm also thinking about option H: "There is no difference in recurrence risks between long segment and short segment disease." So if A is correct, H is incorrect.

But wait, which of these is incorrect? The question only allows one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and one of the options is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, option H says "There is no difference in recurrence risks between long segment and short segment disease." If A is correct, then H is incorrect.

But I'm not sure about the recurrence risk difference between the two. I thought that Hirschsprung's has higher risks in long segments. So A is correct, so H would be incorrect.

But that would mean H is the incorrect statement.

But wait, the question is which is incorrect. So perhaps both C and F are incorrect. But perhaps I should think which of these options is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about H.

H: There is no difference in recurrence risks between long segment and short segment disease.

If H is incorrect because A is correct, then H is incorrect.

So, the question is which statement is incorrect. So, if H is incorrect, then it's the answer.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to find the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Hirschsprung's is a genetic disorder, so option C is incorrect because it's not a blood test. Option F is incorrect because the disease is associated with genetic factors.

So, if the options are presented as statements, then both C and F are incorrect. But the question asks which is incorrect, so the options are single letters.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is F, because I thought the statement was wrong.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is C. Because Hirschsprung's is not diagnosed via a blood test. So, if the question is, which statement is incorrect, and the options are given, then C is incorrect.

Wait, but I'm getting myself into a loop. Let me think of each option's truth.

Which of the options is incorrect.

Hirschsprung's is a genetic disorder, so option C is incorrect because it's not diagnosed via a blood test. So the answer is C.

Wait, but perhaps another perspective: the question's options are whether each statement is correct or incorrect.

So, option F is incorrect, because it's associated with genetic factors.

So, the incorrect statements are F and C. But the question is asking for one incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps the question is from a source where only one is incorrect. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because I'm wrong about Hirschsprung's being genetic. But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that Hirschsprung's is a genetic condition. So, it's not a result of a blood test. So, option C is incorrect.

Thus, the incorrect statement is C.
</think>

To determine the incorrect statement about Hirschsprung's disease, each option was analyzed as follows:

- **A**: "Recurrence risks are greater for long segment disease than for short segment disease."  
  This is correct, as Hirschsprung's disease has higher recurrence risks in long segment cases.

- **B**: "It is more common in girls than in boys."  
  This is correct, as Hirschsprung's is more prevalent in girls.

- **C**: "It can be diagnosed through a routine blood test."  
  This is incorrect. Hirschsprung's is a genetic disorder, not something that is diagnosed through blood tests.

- **D**: "It is a disease that primarily affects the digestive system."  
  This is correct, as it is known to affect the digestive tract.

- **E**: "It shows an association with Down syndrome."  
  This is correct, as Hirschsprung's is associated with Down syndrome.

- **F**: "It is not associated with any genetic factors."  
  This is incorrect. Hirschsprung's is associated with genetic factors.

- **G**: "It is a disease that primarily affects adults."  
  This is incorrect. Hirschsprung's is primarily associated with children.

- **H**: "There is no difference in recurrence risks between long segment and short segment disease."  
  This is incorrect. Hirschsprung's has a higher risk in long segment cases compared to short segment cases.

- **I**: "It shows an association with Autism Spectrum Disorder."  
  This is incorrect. While there may be some overlap, it is not a direct association.

- **J**: "RET is a major susceptibility gene."  
  This is incorrect. While RET is associated with Down syndrome, it is not a major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung's disease.

Among the options, both **C** and **F** are incorrect. However, the question asks for a single incorrect statement. Based on the analysis, **C** is the most clearly incorrect, as Hirschsprung's is not diagnosed through a routine blood test.
