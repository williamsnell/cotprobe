Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Carns's main conclusion. Hmm. I'm not exactly sure what each option refers to, but I'll try to break it down.

The question is asking about what Carens concluded. The options are A through J, each making a different statement about her views on liberal egalitarianism and its relation to immigration policies.

First, I need to recall what I know about liberal egalitarianism. From what I remember, liberal egalitarianism is a social theory that emphasizes equality and the protection of all people's rights, including the right to migrate. It often takes a more pluralistic and inclusive approach, focusing on social justice and the needs of the community rather than strict policies from the government.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Says liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism don't succeed. I think anticosmopolitanism is the belief that immigration is harmful. So, if liberal egalitarianism doesn't have objections to this, that might mean their approach isn't against it. But I'm not sure if that's their main conclusion.

Option B: Believes liberal egalitarianism supports closed borders and strict immigration policies. That doesn't sound right because liberal egalitarianism usually favors open policies, not strict. So I don't think B is correct.

Option C: Argues that liberal egalitarianism is based on anti-immigration sentiments. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they're based on anti-immigration sentiments, that would mean they support strict policies. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Egalitarianism is rooted in envy and unjustified. No, I think that's the opposite. Equality and justice are the foundation, so D is probably wrong.

Option E: Concludes liberal egalitarianism supports anti-cosmopolitanism. Again, cosmopolitanism is about the right to migrate. If liberal egalitarianism supports anti-cosmopolitanism, that would mean it's against it. But I don't recall that being their stance.

Option F: Egalitarianism is justifiable regardless of immigration policies. That doesn't seem right either. I think their approach depends on the immigration policies, not just being justifiable.

Option G: Asserts liberal egalitarianism doesn't have a clear stance on immigration. That could be it. Maybe they're more about the social justice aspect, not specifying exactly how it's done.

Option H: Suggests liberal egalitarianism should press for openness. That sounds like a possible conclusion, as they would favor more welcoming policies.

Option I: Concludes liberal egalitarianism supports anti-cosmopolitanism, which, as I thought before, might not be correct.

Option J: Suggests liberal egalitarianism supports open borders. That would mean they don't have strong anti-cosmopolitan sentiments. So J might be a possible conclusion.

Wait, the question is about the main conclusion. So, let me think about what Carns actually concluded. I think I've read that Carns, in her book "Socialism in the Age of Innovation," argued that liberal egalitarianism is a form of socialism that is justifiable. She probably thought that the key issue was the right to migrate, not about strict policies. So her main conclusion might be that liberal egalitarianism is justifiable, regardless of immigration policies. That would make option J correct.

But wait, another angle: some sources say that Carns' main conclusion was that liberal egalitarianism is justifiable, so she doesn't have strong opinions on immigration policies. Or maybe she did. Alternatively, perhaps she supported open policies, which would make option H correct.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. From what I remember, in her book, Carns believed that the right to migrate is a fundamental social principle. She argued that liberal egalitarianism, which focuses on equality and the protection of all rights, is justifiable. She didn't object strongly to the idea of closing borders, so maybe her main conclusion is that liberal egalitarianism is justifiable, which would tie with option J.

Alternatively, if she did object strongly, maybe her conclusion is that it's justifiable regardless of policies. So, which one is more likely the correct answer?

Alternatively, another approach: looking for the most likely correct answer. I think in some sources, Carns' main conclusion is that liberal egalitarianism is justifiable, so option J, which says that liberal egalitarianism always supports open borders, is her main conclusion.

So the answer is J.

The correct answer is J.
