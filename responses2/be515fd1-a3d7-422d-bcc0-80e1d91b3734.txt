Question:

Why is the division of labor an effective ingredient ofefficient production?

Options:

A: Division of labor restricts workers to a single task, which decreases their overall skill set.
B: Division of labor results in higher wages for all workers due to increased specialization.
C: Division of labor allows every worker to do every task, which increases overall knowledge and flexibility.
D: Division of labor increases efficiency by improving skills, saving time, promoting innovations and allowing use of machines.
E: Division of labor prevents the use of machines in production
F: Division of labor leads to monotony and decreased productivity
G: Division of labor discourages innovative ideas
H: Division of labor is effective because it increases competition among workers, which leads to higher quality products.
I: Division of labor leads to self-sufficiency in workers, minimizing dependence on others for completing tasks.
J: Division of labor reduces the need for communication between workers, which speeds up production.

Okay, let's tackle this question about the division of labor and its effectiveness in efficient production. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the division of labor is a fundamental concept in economics, especially in productivity and efficiency. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll need to think through this carefully.

The question asks why division of labor is effective. The options are A to J, each making a different point. I think I should go through each option and see which makes the most sense.

Starting with option A: Division of labor restricts workers to a single task. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I remember that division of labor encourages workers to specialize in what they are good at, which allows them to become more efficient. So restricting to a single task might not be effective. This option sounds incorrect.

Option B: Higher wages for all workers due to specialization. No, that doesn't make sense. Higher wages would be in specialized roles, but the base pay for everyone would probably be lower. Plus, it doesn't explain how division of labor leads to efficiency. Maybe this option is not the answer.

Option C: Every worker does every task, increases knowledge and flexibility. This seems a bit off. Division of labor breaks tasks so that workers can focus on specific areas. So every worker isn't doing all tasks. Flexibility might come from different skills, but it's not that every task is done by every worker. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Increases efficiency by improving skills, saving time, innovations, and machine use. This sounds plausible. Division of labor allows workers to become more efficient by focusing on their strengths, which reduces time spent on redundant tasks. It also allows for the use of specialized tools and machinery, leading to better products. Plus, it promotes competition, which can drive innovation. So D seems like a strong candidate.

Option E: Prevents machines from being used. No, the opposite. Machines are part of division of labor; they enhance efficiency by automating repetitive tasks.

Option F: Monotony and decreased productivity. That's the opposite of what division of labor does. It makes tasks more varied and engaging, leading to higher productivity.

Option G: Dis discourages innovative ideas. I don't think so. Division of labor doesn't prevent people from trying new ideas. It can lead to diverse skills and ideas.

Option H: Increases competition, leading to higher quality. I'm not sure if this is the best reason. The primary reason might be efficiency and specialized tasks, not necessarily competition. Plus, higher quality could be a result of better division, but the question is about why it's effective, so maybe D is the main reason.

Option I: Leads to self-sufficiency, minimizing dependence. That's more about individual productivity rather than the division's effectiveness in overall production efficiency.

Option J: Reduces the need for communication. While communication is important, division of labor can reduce reliance on others, but it's not the primary reason for its effectiveness.

So, putting it together, the division of labor allows for specialization, which leads to increased efficiency and quality. It makes tasks more varied, allowing workers to develop their skills, and reduces redundant work. This also promotes competition and innovation. Therefore, option D seems the best answer.

The division of labor is effective because it promotes specialization, allowing workers to develop their skills, reduces redundant tasks, and enhances efficiency through specialized tools and machinery. This leads to higher productivity and innovation.

Answer: D
