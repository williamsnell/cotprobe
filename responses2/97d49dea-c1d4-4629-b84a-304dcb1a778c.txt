Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about teaching new behaviors using aversive techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll take it slowly.

The question is asking why it's difficult to teach a new behavior using aversive techniques. The options are A to F, with E and G being the last two. I remember that aversive techniques involve using stimuli that are unpleasant or negative to teach behavior. 

Option A says the behavior becomes more frequent and intense. I think that's right because when you use avers, the behavior is reinforced by the avers. Like, if you show a dog a treat, they'll come back to get it. So the behavior becomes more frequent because the avers are reinforcing it. Also, if the avers are intense, the behavior stays more. So A could be a correct reason.

Option B mentions emotional reactivity is increased. I'm not sure. I know that conditioning can sometimes lead to emotional changes, but I'm not sure if that's a reason for difficulty. Maybe emotional reactivity is more about the conditioning process, not the difficulty of using avers. So not sure about B.

Option C says the frequency is often low. Wait, that doesn't make sense. A is talking about a more frequent behavior, so C would be the opposite. If you're using an avers, the behavior should be more frequent. So C is incorrect.

Option D suggests it increases motivation to learn. I remember this. A lot of conditioning techniques, including using avers, can increase motivation. People are more motivated to learn a new behavior when you're using avers because it's reinforcing. So D might be correct.

Option E: The individual develops a positive association with the aversive technique. Hmm, I'm not so sure. If you use an avers, you're trying to make the behavior associate with a negative stimulus. So the association would be negative, not positive. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: Inhibition co-conditioning is encountered. I'm not familiar with this term. I think co-conditioning is when a behavior is linked with another, like fear of spiders is linked with fear of electricity. I don't think co-conditioning is a term I've heard in the context of using avers. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G says it leads to an immediate and permanent change in behavior. That sounds right. Using avers can make the behavior more frequent and intense, and it can stick over time because the avers are reinforcing it. So G is a strong candidate.

Now, looking back at the options, the question is asking which reason makes it difficult. So the correct reasons would be A, G, or D.

Wait, the question is about why it's difficult. So maybe the behavior isn't learned because the avers aren't effective. Or perhaps the behavior doesn't stick. Or maybe the individual is resistant. But the options given are A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

So, when using avers, the behavior becomes more frequent and intense (A), which makes the behavior more likely to occur. Also, the behavior is reinforced, so the individual becomes more motivated (D). So A and D are correct reasons. But the options are singular, so let's see the options.

Looking at the options again:

A: The behavior becomes more frequent and intense. That's correct.

D: It increases the individual's motivation to learn new behaviors. Also correct.

Wait, but the question is which of the following is a reason why it's difficult. So perhaps the difficulty is that the behavior isn't learned because it's not conditioned properly. Or perhaps using avers can sometimes be ineffective. But the question is about the difficulty encountered.

Alternatively, maybe the behavior doesn't stick because the avers aren't effective. But the options don't include that. So perhaps the most correct reasons are A and D.

Wait, the options given are A to F, and G is an option. But which one is the correct answer based on the question.

The question is: "Attempting to teach a new behavior through the use of aversive techniques is difficult because of which of the following."

So the difficulty would be due to A (becoming more frequent and intense) or D (increasing motivation). Or perhaps the correct answer is A and G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the options, I can't have multiple correct. Let me think again. When you use avers, the behavior can be reinforced, making it more frequent and intense. That's A and D. So the question is which of these is a reason. So the correct answer would include both A and D, but the options are singular.

Wait, no, the options are single choices. So perhaps the answer is A, because it's about the behavior becoming more frequent and intense, which makes it difficult to learn because it's better than without avers. Or maybe D is the answer because without using avers, you can't teach, but using them makes it more difficult.

Wait, no, the question is about why it's difficult, not why it's easier. So if you're using avers, it's difficult to teach because the behavior becomes more frequent and intense. That makes it more challenging. So A is correct.

Alternatively, D says it increases motivation to learn new behaviors. That's a positive effect, so it's making it easier, not harder. So perhaps using avers is making it harder because the behavior becomes more intense and frequent, which is a positive reinforcement and makes it easier to learn. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me recall. When you use an avers, the behavior is reinforced by the avers, so it's more frequent and intense. That makes the behavior more likely to occur, so the individual becomes more motivated to learn the behavior. So using avers makes the behavior more frequent and intense (A), which helps in learning and reinforces it, making the individual more motivated (D). So both A and D are correct reasons. But the options are single choices.

Looking back at the options, I think the correct answer is A because it's about the behavior becoming more frequent and intense, which is a positive outcome that makes it easier to learn. But the question says it's difficult because of which reason. So perhaps the difficulty is that the behavior isn't learned, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. The options are about the difficulty of using avers. So perhaps the correct answer is A because the behavior becomes more intense and frequent, which is the main reason it's difficult because it's more intense than without using the avers.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of another angle. When you use an avers, the behavior is reinforced, making it more frequent and intense. That can help the individual learn the behavior more easily. So it's easier than without using avers, which means it's difficult because it's more challenging to learn. So the difficulty is due to the behavior being more frequent and intense. So A is the correct answer because it's making the behavior more frequent and intense, which is the reason why it's difficult because it's more intense and frequent than without using the avers.

Alternatively, maybe the difficulty is that it's more intense and frequent, making the behavior harder to maintain or learn. So A is the correct answer.

The question asks why using aversive techniques is difficult for teaching a new behavior. The options provided include reasons related to the behavior's behavior frequency and intensity, motivation, and association. 

- **Option A** states that the behavior becomes more frequent and intense, which is correct because avers reinforce the behavior, making it more likely to occur and more intense.
- **Option B** mentions emotional reactivity, which is not directly tied to the difficulty of using avers.
- **Option C** claims the frequency is low, which contradicts the effect of using avers.
- **Option D** states it increases motivation, which is a positive outcome of using avers but not the reason it is difficult.
- **Option E** talks about positive association, which is incorrect because avers lead to negative associations.
- **Option F** refers to co-conditioning, which is not relevant here.
- **Option G** suggests an immediate and permanent change, which is correct but does not address the difficulty specifically.

The difficulty arises because using avers makes the behavior more frequent and intense, which is the primary reason why it is challenging to learn. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: A
