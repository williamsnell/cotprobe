Question:

In an automobile accident case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by driving at an excessive speed. The defendant's attorney calls its first witness, who was standing along the side of the road when the plaintiff's and defendant's cars collided. The defendant's attorney asks the witness: "Is it a fact that in your estimation, plaintiff was traveling at a speed of 45 m. p. h. in a 35 m. p. h. speed zone at the time of the accident?" The plaintiff objects. The trial judge should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because the judge may take judicial notice of the speed limit within the jurisdiction.
B: overrule the objection if the witness has already been shown to be an experienced driver who was able to estimate the approximate speed of moving vehicles.
C: sustain the objection if the witness has not been qualified as an expert witness.
D: sustain the objection, because the witness is not an adverse witness.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about a car accident case. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The scenario is that a defendant has a claim against a plaintiff claiming contributorily negligent. The defendant's attorney is calling a witness who was standing along the side of the road when the cars collided. The witness is asked if the plaintiff was traveling at 45 mph in a 35 mph zone. The plaintiff objects, and the question is what the trial judge should do.

First, I need to recall some legal principles related to witness credibility and the elements of contributory negligence. Contributory negligence is when a defendant's failure to act reasonably contributes to the harm caused by their negligence or the defendant's negligence. Here, the plaintiff was driving at an excessive speed, which would likely be negligence on their part, contributing to the accident.

The key issue here is whether the witness's ability to estimate the speed accurately is sufficient for the witness to be considered credible and thus for the defendant's case. There are different standards for witness credibility, such as the Rule of Five, the Rule of Three, and the Rule of One, which determine how many witnesses must testify and whether they were sufficiently qualified.

In this case, the witness was standing at the time of the accident. The question is about their ability to estimate the speed. If the witness's ability to estimate speed is good, they can be considered credible, which would mean the defendant can not rely on their testimony. But the question is whether the witness's experience or qualifications are relevant.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Overrule the objection because the judge may take judicial notice of the speed limit within the jurisdiction. Wait, I'm not sure about this. Taking judicial notice is more about the judge's decision, not the witness's credibility. The judge's role is to assess credibility, not to notice specific facts. So I'm not sure if A is correct.

Option B: Overrule the objection if the witness has experience as an experienced driver who could estimate speed. That sounds plausible. If the witness is experienced, they might have good estimation skills. But I'm not certain if that's the standard required. The Rule of Three says you need three witnesses, each with at least some experience. But sometimes, a single witness can be credible if they're well-versed. However, the witness's experience might not directly affect whether they can estimate speed. So perhaps B is suggesting that the witness's experience is a factor.

Option C: Sustain the objection if the witness is not qualified as an expert. If the witness is not an expert, they might not have the expertise to estimate speed accurately. So if the witness isn't an expert, they can't be credible, so the defendant can't rely on their testimony. So if the witness isn't qualified, the court should sustain the objection because their testimony would be unreliable. That makes sense because if the witness's testimony is unreliable, the defendant's case would be based on facts they can't support.

Option D: Sustain the objection because the witness is not an adverse witness. Hmm, I remember that the standard for an adverse witness is different. Adverse witnesses are those who can show that their testimony contradicts the defendant's version. But in this case, the witness's credibility isn't about being an adverse witness. So D might not be correct.

So, in this case, the defendant is trying to show that the witness's testimony is reliable. The defendant's attorney wants to know if the witness is credible. If the witness is not an expert (option C), they can't be trusted to give an accurate speed estimate. If the witness is an expert, they might be credible. But the question states the witness is standing along the side at the time. If the witness has no experience, perhaps they can't estimate accurately, but is that a standard?

Wait, there's another angle. The issue is about whether the witness's ability to estimate speed is sufficient. If the witness's estimating accurately, that would mean their testimony is credible. But if the witness is not an expert, they might not have the necessary knowledge to estimate speed well. So if the witness isn't qualified as an expert, their testimony might not be credible, making the defendant's case weaker.

So the options are about the judge's role. The trial judge must make a judgment based on the witness's credibility. If the witness is not an expert, they can't be considered credible. So the trial judge would overrule the objection because the witness isn't credible, so the defense can't rely on their testimony.

Looking back at the options, option C says the judge should sustain the objection if the witness is not an expert. That sounds right.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what the options are presenting. Let me check again.

The options:

A) Overrule because judge can notice speed limit. Not sure about this; the judge assesses credibility, not hears facts.

B) Overrule if experienced driver. I'm not sure if this is a standard. Experience may not directly relate to their ability to estimate speed.

C) Sustain if witness is not an expert. That seems correct.

D) Sustain if not an adverse witness. No, because the admissibility of the witness doesn't depend on being an adverse witness.

So, the correct answer would be option C.
</think>

The trial judge should consider the credibility of the witness. If the witness is not qualified as an expert, their ability to estimate speed accurately would render their testimony unreliable, making the defendant's case weaker. Therefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection because the witness's credibility is in question.
