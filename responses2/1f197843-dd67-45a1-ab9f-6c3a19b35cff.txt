Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this coin tossing problem. The question says we toss a coin until we get two consecutive heads, and the probability of getting heads each time is 3/7. I need to find the average number of tosses required. Hmm, I remember something about Markov chains or recurrence relations for such problems.

Wait, let's think about it step by step. Let's define some states. The basic idea is to model the process with states based on the number of consecutive heads we've seen so far. So, state 0 would mean we haven't seen any heads yet. State 1 would mean we've seen one head. Once we reach state 2, that's the goal, so that's an absorbing state.

The goal is to find the expected number of steps (tosses) to reach state 2 starting from state 0. Let me denote E0 as the expected number of tosses starting from state 0, and E1 as the expected number from state 1.

When we're in state 0, each toss has a 3/7 chance of landing heads, moving us to state 1, and a 4/7 chance of tails, keeping us in state 0. So, the expected value E0 can be expressed as:

E0 = 1 + (3/7)*E1 + (4/7)*E0

Wait, why? Because each toss takes one step, and then based on the outcome, we either stay in state 0 (and have E0 expected steps from there) or move to state 1 (and E1 expected steps from there). The equation represents the average number of steps needed from state 0.

Similarly, when we're in state 1, another toss could give us two heads (absorbing state), or we get a tail (go back to state 0). So, for E1:

E1 = 1 + (3/7)*0 + (4/7)*E0

Wait, because if we get a head (prob 3/7), we move to state 2, which is the end, so no more steps. If we get a tail (prob 4/7), we go back to state 0 and have to start over.

Now, let's solve these equations. Let me write them again:

1. E0 = 1 + (3/7)E1 + (4/7)E0
2. E1 = 1 + (4/7)E0

Hmm, let's rearrange equation 1. Subtract (4/7)E0 from both sides:

E0 - (4/7)E0 = 1 + (3/7)E1

Which simplifies to (3/7)E0 = 1 + (3/7)E1

Multiply both sides by 7/3 to solve for E0:

E0 = (7/3) + E1

Now, equation 2 is E1 = 1 + (4/7)E0. Let's substitute E0 from equation 1 into equation 2.

E1 = 1 + (4/7)*[(7/3) + E1]

Let me compute that step by step:

(4/7) * (7/3) = 4/3.
(4/7) * E1 = (4/7)E1.

So, E1 = 1 + 4/3 + (4/7)E1.

Add 1 and 4/3: 1 is 3/3, so 3/3 +4/3 =7/3.

E1 = 7/3 + (4/7)E1.

Now, let's get all E1 terms on one side. Subtract (4/7)E1 from both sides:

E1 - (4/7)E1 = 7/3.

Left side: (3/7)E1.

So, (3/7)E1 =7/3.

Multiply both sides by 7/3:

E1 = (7/3) * (7/3) = 49/9 ≈5.44444.

Wait, that's E1. Now let's find E0.

From E0 = (7/3) + E1.

E1 is 49/9, so:

E0 = 7/3 +49/9.

Convert 7/3 to 21/9. So, 21/9 +49/9 =70/9 ≈7.77778.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 8.88889 and option I is 7.77778. So, the answer would be I:7.77778.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let's recheck the steps.

Equation 1: E0 =1 + (3/7)E1 + (4/7)E0 → E0 -4/7 E0 =1 +3/7 E1 → 3/7 E0=1 +3/7 E1 → E0= (7/3) + E1.

Equation 2: E1=1 +4/7 E0 → substitute E0:

E1=1 +4/7*(7/3 + E1) → 1 + (4/7*7/3) +4/7 E1 → 1 +4/3 +4/7 E1.

1 is 3/3, so 3/3+4/3=7/3. So, E1=7/3 +4/7 E1.

Move terms: E1 -4/7 E1=7/3 → (3/7) E1=7/3 → E1= (7/3) * (7/3)=49/9≈5.44444.

Then E0=7/3 +49/9.

7/3 is 21/9, so 21/9 +49/9=70/9≈7.77778, which is 7.77778, which matches option I.

Wait, but the options don't have I as the first choice. Wait, looking back, the options are A through J:

A:9.99999

B:10.11111

C:11.11111

D:12.22222

E:5.55556

F:13.33333

G:6.66667

H:8.88889

I:7.77778

J:4.44444

So, option I is 7.77778, which is what I got. So the average number of tosses is approximately 7.77778, which is option I.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the expected number of tosses needed to get two consecutive heads, with a head probability of 3/7. Using Markov chain states and solving the resulting equations, the expected value E0 (starting from state 0) is found to be approximately 7.77778, which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I:7.77778
