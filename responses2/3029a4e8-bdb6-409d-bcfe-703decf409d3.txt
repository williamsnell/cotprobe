Question:

A state has enacted a statute imposing a tax on the extraction of all platinum in the state. The extraction of other minerals is not taxed by the state. This is true even though there is considerable mining of silver, turquoise, sulfur, and stone within the state. As a result, the largest platinum mining company in the state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion if the mining company attacks the statute as violating the equal protection of the laws?

Options:

A: The state must convince the court that the tax is rationally related to the advancement of a compelling state interest.
B: The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is not necessary to advance a legitimate state interest.
C: The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.
D: The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is necessary to advance a compelling state interest.
E: The mining company must convince the court that the tax is not necessary to advance a legitimate state interest.
F: The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.
G: The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.
H: The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not necessary to advance a compelling state interest.
I: The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.
J: The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the most restrictive means by which to advance a legitimate state interest.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically about the Equal Protection Clause in the context of a state statute imposing a tax on extraction of platinum. Let's break this down step by step.

The question says that the state has a statute that taxes the extraction of all platinum but doesn't tax other minerals like silver, turquoise, sulfur, or stone. Even though there's a lot of mining in the state, the platinum tax exists. The largest company in the state is suing this, claiming the platinum tax is unconstitutional because it violates the Equal Protection Clause.

I need to figure out which option correctly states the burden the state must place on the mining company to prove the statute is violating the Equal Protection Clause.

First, I remember that the Equal Protection Clause, which is addressed under the Fifth Amendment, requires states to ensure that their laws are not arbitrarily restricted in a way that would harm a significant part of its citizens. The main issue here is whether the platinum tax is justified as a state action.

The statute in this case taxes platinum extraction but not other minerals. So, the state is only taxing a specific resource. Now, the Equal Protection Clause applies to all state actions that are so significant that they might reasonably be considered to affect a substantial part of the state's residents.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The state must prove the tax is rationally related to a state interest. That makes sense because the statute is a state action, so it must be tied to a legitimate state purpose.

Option B: The state needs to show the classification is unnecessary. But in this case, the classification is necessary because platinum extraction is a legitimate state interest. So, this might not be the right burden.

Option C: The mining company needs to show the classification is the least restrictive. Wait, I thought the burden is on the state, not the company. So this option might be incorrect.

Option D: The state must show the classification is necessary. That's similar to option B, but phrased differently. It's about necessity.

Option E: The state must show the tax isn't necessary. That doesn't make sense because the company is suing that it is necessary.

Option F: The state must show the classification is the least restrictive. Wait, same issue as option C, this seems to be about the company's side.

Option G: The mining company must show classification isn't related. But if the classification isn't related, that doesn't support the claim that the tax is necessary. So G might not be correct.

Option H: The company must show classification isn't related. Again, if the classification isn't related, the state's actions aren't necessary, which isn't what the company is trying to prove.

Option I: The state must show classification is related. That would make sense because the company is trying to prove the tax is necessary.

Option J: The company must show classification isn't necessary. That's the opposite of what they're trying to do.

So, the key is that the state must prove the tax is necessary under the Equal Protection Clause. Therefore, the burden is on the state. Looking at the options, option I says the state must prove the classification is related, which is correct because the company is trying to show that the platinum tax is necessary for a state interest.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the Equal Protection burden is on the state, but in some cases, it's on the defendant if the state's actions are arbitrary. But in this question, the state is trying to prove that the classification is necessary, which would tie into their own legal claim.

So, reviewing the options, the correct answer should be option I: The state must show the classification is related.

Wait, another angle: the Equal Protection burden is on the state. So the options that make the state's burden are A, I, etc. So, the options that claim the state must show the tax is related are relevant. For example, option I says the state must prove the classification is related.

Wait, but option I is worded as: The state must convince the court that the classification is rationally related. That's accurate because they need to show the tax is a state action that's justifiable.

So, the correct option is I. But wait, looking at the options again, option I is: "The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest." Yes, that's correct.

The question revolves around proving the constitutionality of a state statute that taxes extraction of platinum but not other minerals, even though significant mining exists in the state. The mining company is suing, claiming the platinum tax violates the Equal Protection Clause. To establish the state's burden, the analysis focuses on whether the tax is necessary for a legitimate state interest.

Key points:
1. **Equal Protection Clause**: The burden lies with the state to show that the tax is necessary for a legitimate state interest.
2. **Correct Option**: The state must prove the classification in the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A, D, G, J**: Incorrect. These options fail to address the necessity of the classification.
   - **B, C, E, F, H, I**: Incorrect. These options focus on the company's burden, which is irrelevant here.
4. **Conclusion**: The correct answer is **I**, as it accurately states the state's burden to demonstrate the tax is justifiable under a legitimate state interest.
