Okay, so I've got this question here about cell classification. Hmm, the question is asking which characteristic can distinguish a prokaryotic cell from an animal cell. I'm a bit rusty on my cell structures, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that prokaryotic cells are bacteria-like, right? They don't have the cell membrane or a nucleus, I think. They live in environments where they can't move like animals do, so their structure is more compact.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: Centrioles. I know that prokaryotes have centrioles, which are structures they form during cell division. Animal cells, on the other hand, don't have centrioles. So if a cell has centrioles, it's probably a prokaryote. But wait, the question is about characteristics to distinguish them, so maybe this is relevant.

Option B: Chloroplasts. Those are organelles in eukaryotic cells. Bacteria don't have chloroplasts, so that's out.

Option C: Lysosomes. These are organelles in bacteria too, part of the cell's waste disposal. So they're definitely prokaryotic.

Option D: Cell wall. Both prokaryotes and animals can have cell walls. So this isn't a distinguishing feature.

Option E: Mitochondria. These are in animals and eukaryotes, not prokaryotes.

Option F: Ribosomes. Again, only in eukaryotes.

Option G: Cell membrane. Both have cell membranes, so this isn't helpful.

Option H: Endoplasmic reticulum. That's also a cellular component in eukaryotes.

Option I: Nucleus. Prokaryotes have a nucleus, animals don't, so this is a key difference.

Option J: Golgi apparatus. Eukaryotes have it, prokaryotes don't.

Wait, the question is about characteristics that allow us to distinguish them. So looking for a feature that prokaryotes have and animals don't.

Centrioles are part of prokaryotes, but since the question is about a characteristic, maybe it's more about something that's unique. Nucleus is definitely a unique feature. Without a nucleus, prokaryotes can't function in the same way. So 'I: Nucleus' would be the right answer.

But wait, could there be other options? Let me think again. For example, does the presence of a cell wall (D) or cell membrane (G) indicate anything? No, both have them.

So the key distinguishing feature is the nucleus. So the correct answer should be I: Nucleus.

The correct answer is I: Nucleus. Prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, have a distinct nucleus where cellular processes such as protein synthesis and DNA replication occur. Animal cells, on the other hand, lack a nucleus and are therefore distinguished by this feature.

Answer: I
