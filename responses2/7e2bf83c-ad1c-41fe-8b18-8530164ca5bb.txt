Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this economics question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about how a deep prolonged recession in the Japanese economy would affect the U.S. net exports, the value of the dollar, and the value of the yen. The options are A through J, each with combinations of increases, decreases, or no change for each of the three factors.

Hmm, I remember that recessions can have various effects on different economic indicators. A deep recession in Japan's economy would likely lead to a decrease in net exports because Japan is probably not exporting as much as before. Because if the economy is struggling, people might save more and not need to buy as much goods, so U.S. exports would come from Japan in reduced amounts. So net exports would decrease.

Now, what about the value of the dollar? If the U.S. is selling more to Japan, that might affect the dollar's value. If the dollar becomes stronger, it would make more imports cheaper for the U.S. So perhaps the dollar's value would increase. But wait, if the U.S. exports are increasing (since Japan's economy is struggling, maybe they need less), does that mean the U.S. wants to buy more, which makes the dollar stronger? So yes, dollar value would increase.

What about the yen? Japan has a strong yen, right? So if the dollar value increases, because U.S. buyers are buying more yen, then the yen's value would decrease. Because more dollars can buy the same amount of yen. So the yen's value would go down.

Let me check the options. The options are:

Looking at the question, the three factors are U.S. net exports, value of dollar, value of yen.

So, based on my reasoning:

- U.S. net exports decrease.
- Dollar value increases.
- Yen value decreases.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Decreases, Increases, Decreases. That matches what I thought.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up any concepts. For instance, if Japan's economy is bad, U.S. exports from Japan would decrease, so net exports (which are exports minus imports) would decrease.

What about the exchange rate? If the dollar is stronger, it's more expensive for U.S. exports, but in this case, U.S. are selling more, so perhaps the demand for dollars increases. That would make the dollar stronger. So yes, dollar value increases.

As for the yen, since the dollar is more valuable, the yen would be weaker. So the yen would decrease in value.

So the answer should be option E.

The correct answer is **E: Decreases, Increases, Decreases**.

**Explanation:**
- **U.S. Net Exports:** A deep recession in Japan reduces U.S. exports, leading to a decrease in net exports.
- **Value of the Dollar:** Increased U.S. exports from Japan make the dollar stronger, so its value increases.
- **Value of the Yen:** With a stronger dollar, the yen weakens, so its value decreases.

**Answer:** E
