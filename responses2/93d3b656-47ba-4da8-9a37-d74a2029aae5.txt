Okay, so I have this question about calculating the abnormal return, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think through what I know.

First, the question gives me some information: the risk-free rate Rf is 4%, the market return Rm is 12%, the portfolio's beta is 1.8. The beginning value is $50,000 and the ending value is $60,000. I need to find the abnormal return.

Wait, what's abnormal return? Oh right, abnormal return is the difference between the actual return of the portfolio and the expected return. The expected return is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). So the steps are: calculate the actual return of the portfolio, calculate the expected return using CAPM, subtract expected from actual to get abnormal return.

So first, the actual return. The portfolio goes from $50k to $60k. So the return is (Ending Value - Beginning Value)/Beginning Value. That's (60,000 - 50,000)/50,000 = 10,000 / 50,000 = 0.2, which is 20%.

Wait, but usually, returns are in percentage terms. So 20% is 0.2.

Now, the expected return for the portfolio. Using CAPM: E(R) = Rf + Beta*(Rm - Rf). Plugging in the numbers: Rf is 4%, Beta is 1.8, Rm is 12%.

So Rm - Rf is 12% - 4% = 8%. Multiply by Beta: 1.8 * 8% = 14.4%. Add Rf: 4% +14.4% = 18.4%.

So the expected return is 18.4%, which is 0.184 in decimal.

Abnormal return is actual return minus expected return. So 20% - 18.4% = 1.6%.

Wait, the options are in decimal, so 1.6% is 0.016. Looking at the options, option C is 0.016, which would be 1.6%.

Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's double-check.

Actual return: (60000-50000)/50000 = 10,000/50,000 = 0.2 → 20%.

CAPM: 4% + 1.8*(12-4) = 4% + 1.8*8% → 4% + 14.4% = 18.4%. So expected is 18.4%.

Abnormal: 20% -18.4% = 1.6%, which is 0.016. So the correct answer should be option C.

The abnormal return is calculated as the difference between the actual return and the expected return. 

1. **Actual Return**: The portfolio increases from $50,000 to $60,000. The return is:
   \[
   \frac{60,000 - 50,000}{50,000} = 0.2 \, \text{or} \, 20\%.
   \]

2. **Expected Return (CAPM)**: Using the formula \( E(R) = R_f + \beta(R_m - R_f) \), where \( R_f = 4\% \), \( R_m = 12\% \), and \( \beta = 1.8 \):
   \[
   E(R) = 4\% + 1.8 \times (12\% - 4\%) = 4\% + 14.4\% = 18.4\%.
   \]

3. **Abnormal Return**:
   \[
   20\% - 18.4\% = 1.6\% = 0.016.
   \]

Thus, the abnormal return is **0.016**.
