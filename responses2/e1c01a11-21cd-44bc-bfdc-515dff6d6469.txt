Okay, so I've got this question about the energy levels of sodium. Hmm, I remember that the principal series of sodium has a first line at 5890 A°, which is the D line. This is a transition from the first excited state (which is 3p) to the ground state (3s). The question is asking for the energy difference, or the energy of the first excited state. 

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here. Oh right, energy levels in atoms are quantized, and the energy difference between states corresponds to the photon's energy. So the energy of the transition is the difference between the excited state and the ground state.

I think the energy levels for hydrogen can be calculated using the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n². But wait, sodium isn't hydrogen, right? Sodium has multiple electrons, so maybe I need to consider that. Oh, but wait, the question is about the transition in the principal series, which I think refers to the hydrogen-like series. So perhaps it's similar to hydrogen.

So, the transition is from n=2 (the 3s state) to n=3 (the 3p state). Wait no, wait. Wait, the hydrogen-like formula uses n. So for n=2 to n=3, the energy difference is E_2 - E_3, but because energy is negative, the transition energy would be E_3 - E_2? Or wait, no. The energy levels are E_2 (n=2) is higher than E_3 (n=3). So the transition emits a photon with energy E_3 - E_2, which is positive.

Wait, actually, the energy of the photon is E = E_final - E_initial. So when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, the photon's energy is the difference between the two. Since the initial state is higher, the energy comes out as E_initial - E_final.

So in this case, the transition is 3p (n=3) to 3s (n=2). So the energy of the photon is E_initial - E_final. So E_initial is E_3 and E_final is E_2.

Calculating each energy level:

E_3 = -13.6 eV / (3)^2 = -13.6 /9 = -1.5111 eV.
E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.

So the photon energy is E_3 - E_2 = (-1.5111) - (-3.4) = 1.8889 eV.

Wait, but the options are in eV, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the energy of the excited state. Oh wait, the question is asking for the energy of the first excited state. Wait, that's confusing. Oh wait, the first excited state is n=2. But wait, the transition is from 3p (n=3) to 3s (n=2). So the energy of the first excited state is the energy of n=2, which is -3.4 eV. But that's the energy of the ground state, not the first excited. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, no. The energy levels are E_n. The first excited state is n=2, so E_2 is -3.4 eV. So the first excited state is at -3.4 eV. But the options don't have that. Wait, let me look at the options:

The options A to J are all positive numbers. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Oh, wait! The question says, "What is the energy of the first excited state?" Wait, but the first excited state is n=2, which is -3.4 eV. But none of the options give that. So perhaps I'm getting the question wrong. Maybe it's not the energy of the excited state, but the energy difference for the transition, which is the energy of the photon emitted, which is 1.8889 eV.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.995 eV. Hmm, but 1.8889 is approximately 1.89 eV. But option H is 1.895 eV, which is 1.9 eV. Oh wait, perhaps they're considering the energy to the first excited state as the energy difference from the ground state.

Wait, the ground state is n=1, which is -13.6 eV. The first excited state (n=2) is -3.4 eV. The energy of the first excited state is 10.2 eV above the ground state (since -3.4 - (-13.6) = 10.2 eV). But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question isn't asking about the ground state energy but the energy of the excited state relative to something else.

Wait, the question says, "the energy ineV of the first excited state." Hmm, that's unclear. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energy of the first excited state in terms of the energy of the ground state. No, that doesn't make sense because the ground state is the lowest energy. Or perhaps, no: "the energy of the first excited state" refers to the energy of the state itself, which is the energy associated with n=2, which is -3.4 eV. But that's not an option.

Wait, let me read the question again. The question says, "What is the energy ineV of the first excited state?" Oh, perhaps it's a typo and they mean "the energy of the first excited state" in terms of the energy difference. Wait, no; the question is in the context of the energy of the transition. Because the first line of the principal series is the D line with a wavelength of 5890 A°, which corresponds to a transition from n=3 to n=2.

So the energy of the transition is 1.8889 eV, which is approximately 1.89 eV. Looking at the options, that would match option H: 1.895 eV, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correctly phrased, and I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me recalculate the energy levels.

E_n = - (13.6 eV) / n².

For n=2: E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.

For n=3: E_3 = -13.6 /9 ≈ -1.5111 eV.

The energy of the transition (energy emitted) is E_3 - E_2 = (-1.5111) - (-3.4) = 1.8889 eV = approximately 1.89 eV.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.895 eV, which is about 0.004 eV higher than 1.89. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me calculate 13.6 /9. Let's see: 9 * 1.5 is 13.5, so 13.6 /9 is about 1.5111 eV. So E_3 is -1.5111.

E_2 is -3.4 eV. So E_2 - E_3 is ( -3.4 - (-1.5111) ) = -3.4 + 1.5111 = -1.8889 eV. But the energy of the photon is E_3 - E_2, which is +1.8889 eV.

Wait, perhaps I have this backwards. The energy of the photon emitted is E_final - E_initial. So when an electron moves from higher energy level to lower, the photon's energy is positive. So E_initial is E_3 = -1.5111 eV, E_final is E_2 = -3.4 eV.

So the photon's energy is E_initial - E_final = (-1.5111) - (-3.4) = 1.8889 eV.

So the energy of the photon is 1.8889 eV, which is approximately 1.89 eV. So looking at the options, which one is closest? Looking at the options:

H is 1.895 eV. That's about 0.004 eV higher. Alternatively, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the photon emitted from the n=3 to n=2 transition is given by E_photon = (13.6 eV) (1/2² - 1/3²) )

So:

13.6 (1/4 - 1/9) = 13.6 ( (9 -4)/(36) ) = 13.6 (5/36) ) = 13.6 * 0.138888... ≈ 1.9 eV.

Wait, 5/36 is approximately 0.138888... So 13.6 * 0.138888 = let's compute.

13 * 0.138888 ≈ 1.804. 0.6 * 0.138888≈0.0833. So total ≈1.887 eV. Which is about the same as before.

Looking at the options, the closest is H: 1.895 eV, which is a bit higher. But wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energy of the first excited state, which is n=2, which is -3.4 eV. But none of the options are negative. So perhaps the question is about the energy of the transition, which is 1.89 eV.

But the options don't have 1.89. The closest is H: 1.895 eV, which is 0.004 eV higher.

Wait, but wait. Did I compute the energy correctly? Let me double-check.

Calculating E_3: 13.6 / 9 = 1.5111 eV? No, because n² is 9; 13.6 eV divided by 9 is approximately 1.5111 eV. So E_3 is -1.5111 eV.

E_2 is -3.4 eV.

So E_3 - E_2 = (-1.5111) - (-3.4) = 1.8889 eV. So 1.8889 eV is approximately 1.89 eV.

Looking at the options:

H is 1.895 eV, which is 0.004 eV higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the energy difference is E_3 - E_2, which is 1.8889 eV. Which is about 1.89 eV.

Looking at the options, none have exactly that. The closest is H:1.895 eV. But that's 0.006 eV higher, which might be significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the transition but the energy of the first excited state, which is n=2, which is -3.4 eV. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question is in the context of the first line of the principal series. The first line corresponds to the transition from n=3 to n=2. So the energy of this transition is the energy of the photon emitted, which is 1.89 eV. So the correct answer would be approximately 1.89 eV. Looking at the options, H is 1.895 eV. So that's the closest option. Alternatively, perhaps the actual value is 1.8889 eV, which is approximately 1.89 eV. 

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact value. 13.6 (1/2² - 1/3²) = 13.6 (1/4 - 1/9) = 13.6*(5/36) ≈ 13.6 * 0.138888 ≈ 1.8889 eV. So 1.8889 eV is approximately 1.89 eV. 

The options are:

A: 2.105 eV

B:2.505 eV

C:2.305 eV

D:2.405 eV

E:1.705 eV

F:1.995 eV

G:2.005 eV

H:1.895 eV

I:2.210 eV

J:1.805 eV

So the correct answer is approximately 1.89 eV, but the closest option is H: 1.895 eV. But wait, that's 0.004 higher than the correct value. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the energy of the first excited state, which is n=2, which is -3.4 eV. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: the first excited state is n=2. The energy of n=2 is -3.4 eV. The first excited state is the state after the ground state. So the energy of the first excited state is the energy of n=2. But that's -3.4 eV. However, this is not an option.

Looking at the options again, none is negative. So perhaps the question is incorrect or perhaps I'm misunderstanding what it's asking. Let me reread the question.

The question is: "What is the energy ineV of the first excited state?" The question is in the context of the principal series of sodium. Oh wait, the principal series is the hydrogen-like series. So perhaps the first excited state is the first ionization energy, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the energy required to ionize the atom, which is the energy of the first excited state. Or perhaps I'm confusing the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing the transition energy with the energy of the state. Let me think: maybe the question is actually about the energy of the first excited state (n=2), which is -3.4 eV. But the question is phrased as "energy of the first excited state," perhaps expecting the ionization energy, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy of the transition, which is the energy of the emitted photon, which is 1.89 eV. H is 1.895 eV, which is the closest. So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option H is 1.895 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute 13.6*(1/4 - 1/9) again.

1/4 is 0.25, 1/9≈0.1111. 0.25 - 0.1111=0.138888. 13.6 * 0.138888≈1.8889 eV. So 1.8889 eV is approximately 1.89 eV.

Looking again, option H is 1.895 eV, which is 0.006 eV higher. So perhaps I miscalculated somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Rydberg formula in reverse. The Rydberg formula is 1/lambda = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For hydrogen, R is about 1.097e4 m^-1.

But wait, sodium is not hydrogen, but the principal series corresponds to hydrogen-like atoms. So for sodium, the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV /n², as usual.

So the energy of the transition is 13.6*(1/2² - 1/3²) = 13.6*(1/4 - 1/9) = 13.6*(5/36) ≈1.8889 eV.

So the correct answer should be approximately 1.89 eV. Looking at the options, option H is 1.895 eV, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but let me check if I made any calculation mistakes. 13.6 * (5/36) = 13.6 * 0.138888....

Let me compute 13 * 0.1388888... = 1.8 eV, and 0.6 * 0.138888...=0.083333... So 1.8 + 0.083333 = 1.883333 eV. So approximately 1.883 eV.

So option H is 1.895 eV, which is about 0.012 eV higher. Hmm.

But wait, none of the options exactly match. So perhaps the correct answer is option H, but I'm a little confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ionization energy, which for sodium is about 5890A, which is the energy of the transition. So the energy required to ionize is the energy of the ground state, which is 13.6 eV. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the question as referring to the energy of the first excited state in the context of the principal series. The first excited state is the state with the lowest energy, which is the ground state. But that's -13.6 eV, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ionization energy, but no. The ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from the atom, which for sodium is about 5890 A, which is the energy of the transition.

But the options don't have 5890 eV. So perhaps I'm back to the energy of the transition being approximately 1.89 eV. So the correct answer is H, which is 1.895 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering hydrogen's Rydberg formula. Let's compute 13.6*(1/2² -1/3²) again.

13.6*(1/4 -1/9) =13.6*(9 -4)/(36)=13.6*(5/36)=13.6*(0.138888)=1.88888 eV, which is about 1.89 eV.

So the correct answer should be H: 1.895 eV. But wait, 1.8889 is approximately 1.89 eV. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

To determine the energy of the first excited state in the context of the principal series of sodium, we analyze the energy levels of the hydrogen-like series. Sodium corresponds to the hydrogen-like series, and the energy levels are given by:

\[
E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Energy of the Ground State (n=1)
The ground state corresponds to the most tightly bound electron, with \(n=1\):
\[
E_1 = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{1^2} = -13.6 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Energy of the First Excited State (n=2)
The first excited state corresponds to \(n=2\):
\[
E_2 = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{2^2} = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{4} = -3.4 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Energy of the Transition (n=3 to n=2)
The transition corresponds to a photon emitted with energy equal to the difference between the energy levels:
\[
E_{\text{transition}} = E_3 - E_2.
\]

First, calculate the energy levels:
\[
E_3 = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{3^2} = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{9} \approx -1.5111 \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
E_2 = -3.4 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, calculate the energy of the transition:
\[
E_{\text{transition}} = E_3 - E_2 = (-1.5111 \, \text{eV}) - (-3.4 \, \text{eV}) = 1.8889 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with the Options
The calculated energy of the transition is approximately \(1.8889 \, \text{eV}\). Comparing this value with the options provided:

- **A: 2.105 eV**  
- **B: 2.505 eV**  
- **C: 2.305 eV**  
- **D: 2.405 eV**  
- **E: 1.705 eV**  
- **F: 1.995 eV**  
- **G: 2.005 eV**  
- **H: 1.895 eV**  
- **I: 2.210 eV**  
- **J: 1.805 eV**  

The closest option is **H: 1.895 eV**, which is approximately \(0.004 \, \text{eV}\) higher than the calculated value. This small discrepancy may arise from rounding differences in the calculation.

### Conclusion
The energy of the transition corresponds to the energy of the photon emitted during the transition from \(n=3\) to \(n=2\). The closest option provided is **H: 1.895 eV**.
