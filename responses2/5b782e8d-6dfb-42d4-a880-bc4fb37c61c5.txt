Question:

Why is it that the banking system as a whole can produce a multiple expansion of deposits while a single bank within that system cannot?

Options:

A: The expansion of deposits is regulated by a central authority that dictates the exact amount each bank can lend.
B: Each bank is required to convert all deposits into long-term investments, eliminating the potential for deposit expansion.
C: Banks operate independently without any interbank transactions, so deposits in one bank do not influence another.
D: The deposit expansion only occurs within one bank.
E: Banks do not need to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves.
F: Each bank within the system retains all deposits without lending, preventing any expansion of deposits.
G: The banking system can produce a multiple expansion of deposits because when loans from one bank become deposits in other banks, these deposits are partly used to make new loans, increasing total deposits in banks taken together by a multiple of the increase in the deposits of any one of them.
H: Each bank can lend out the entire amount of its deposits.
I: Single banks can lend an unlimited amount without affecting the overall banking system's deposit levels.
J: The banking system relies on a single reserve that is shared equally among all banks, ensuring uniform deposit expansion.

Okay, so I've got this question about banking systems and why multiple banks can expand deposits even though a single bank can't. Hmm, I remember something about this from my economics class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through it.

The question is asking why the banking system's total deposits can expand multiple times while a single bank can't. I think it's related to how banks interact with each other. I remember the concept of the money multiplier. Oh right, the idea is that when one bank lends out money, those loans get deposited into other banks, which then lend out even more. This creates a chain reaction, right?

So, if there's a single bank making a deposit, it can only lend a certain percentage, probably based on the reserve ratio. Let me see, usually that's around 10%, but I think in this question it's a different scenario. Wait, the options don't have the exact 10% mentioned, but the point is the multiplier effect.

Looking at the options, option G says that when loans from one bank become deposits in others, these are partly used to make new loans, increasing total deposits in the system by a multiple. That sounds like the money multiplier concept. So, for example, if the reserve ratio is 10%, and the bank lends out 90%, those 90 units become deposits in others. Those deposits can then be lent out by multiple banks, each lending out their own portion, which adds up. So the total deposits in the system increase by a multiple of the initial deposit.

Wait, let me think again. If a single bank has a deposit of D, and the reserve ratio is r, then the bank can lend out (1 - r)D. But when that money is deposited elsewhere, each of those banks can lend out a fraction of them. So the total deposit expansion is a multiple of the initial deposit. So the multiple depends on how much each subsequent bank lends. 

So the multiple is usually 1/r, where r is the reserve ratio. For example, if r is 0.1, the multiple is 10. So the initial deposit D will lead to D*10 in the system. 

So the correct reason is option G. It says that when loans from one bank become deposits in others, these are partly used to make new loans, increasing total deposits. 

Let me check other options to make sure none of them fit. 

Option A talks about a central authority. That's more like the role of the central bank, which might control the rate of expansion. But the question is about internal operations of a banking system, so A is less likely.

Option B is about converting deposits into investments. That would prevent expansion, so that's not the reason.

Option C suggests banks operate independently, but if they don't, their deposits don't influence each other. But that doesn't explain the multiple expansion. It's more about the interbank lending.

Option D says deposit expansion only within one bank. No, because the question says multiple banks can expand.

Option E: Keeping a certain reserve. That's about the reserve requirement, which doesn't directly explain the multiple expansion.

Option F: Each bank keeps all deposits. That would prevent any expansion, so F is wrong.

Option I: Single banks can lend unlimited. No, because they have to keep some as reserves.

Option J: A single reserve. Doesn't explain the multiple expansion.

So the correct answer must be G.

The banking system's ability to produce a multiple expansion of deposits while a single bank cannot is due to the concept of the money multiplier. When a bank makes a deposit, that money is lent out, which is then deposited by other banks. These deposits can be lent out by multiple banks, each lending out a portion, which increases the total deposits in the system by a multiple of the initial deposit. This multiple depends on the reserve ratio, typically around 10%. 

Analyzing the options, option G best explains this mechanism, as it highlights the interbank transactions and the use of deposited funds to facilitate further lending, leading to the overall expansion.
