Okay, so I have this combinatorics problem here, and I need to find the sum of all integers k such that the sum of binomial coefficients C(23,4) + C(23,5) equals C(24,k). Hmm, binomial coefficients, right? I remember that there are some identities involving the sum of such terms.

Wait, isn't there a property where C(n, r) + C(n, r+1) equals C(n+1, r+1)? Let me think... Yeah, I think that's the Pascal's identity. So applying that here, if n is 23 and r is 4, then C(23,4) + C(23,5) should equal C(24,5). Because when you add C(23,4) and C(23,5), it's like adding the two adjacent terms in the 23rd row of Pascal's triangle, which would give the term directly below them in the 24th row.

So that means C(24,5) is the right-hand side of the equation. Now, the question is asking for all integers k such that C(24,k) equals this value. Since binomial coefficients are symmetric, C(n, k) = C(n, n - k). So for C(24,5), the other k's would be 24 - 5, which is 19.

Wait, but are there any other k's that satisfy this? Let me think. For binomial coefficients, each row only has one 1 at the ends. So in the 24th row, apart from C(24,5) and C(24,19), are there any other k's where C(24,k) equals this value? I don't think so because the binomial coefficients increase up to the middle and then decrease symmetrically. So for 24 choose k, if k isn't 5 or 19, it won't equal C(24,5). So the only k's are 5 and 19.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, is 5 and 19 the only solutions? Because the problem says "the sum of all integers k", so 5 + 19 would be 24. But looking at the options, 24 is option F. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the question says "the sum of all integers k", so if k can be 5 and 19, then their sum is 24. But let me think again. Wait, is there any other k that would make C(24,k) equal to C(24,5)? For example, does C(24,0) equal C(24,24) or something? No, I don't think so. Because the binomial coefficients are unique in their symmetry. So C(n, k) equals C(n, n - k), but only for one k in each pair unless n=0 or n=1, which is not the case here.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. The original equation is C(23,4) + C(23,5) = C(24,k). Using the identity C(n, r) + C(n, r+1) = C(n+1, r+1), so n=23, r=4. So that gives C(24,5) = C(23,4) + C(23,5). So that part is correct.

So then, the equation becomes C(24,5) = C(24,k). So k can be 5 or 24 - 5 = 19. Therefore, the integers k are 5 and 19. So the sum of these integers is 5 + 19 = 24. So looking at the options, 24 is option F.

But wait, the options are A:5, B:3, C:20, D:22, E:19, F:24, G:26, H:23, I:21, J:25. So 24 is option F, which would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Wait another thought: sometimes in combinatorics, the same value can be achieved by multiple k's if the binomial coefficients are the same for different k's. But as I thought before, C(24, k) is equal to C(24, 24 -k). So unless 5 = 24 -5, which is 19, which isn't the case, so 5 and 19 are the only two k's. So their sum is 24, which is option F.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Let me just compute C(23,4) and C(23,5) to see if their sum is indeed C(24,5). I can compute those values, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, I recall that C(n, r) = n!/(r!(n - r)!). So C(23,4) is 23!/(4!19!) and C(23,5) is 23!/(5!18!). So adding them together: [23!/(4!19!)] + [23!/(5!18!)].

But this might be tedious, but maybe I can factor something out. Let me factor out 23!/(5!19!) from both terms. So:

C(23,4) = (23!)/(4!19!) = [23 × 22 × 21 × 20 × 19! ] / (4! × 19!) = (23×22×21×20)/24.

Similarly, C(23,5) = (23!)/(5!18!) = [23×22×21×20×19! ] / (5! ×18!) = [23×22×21×20×19]/120.

Adding these two: [23×22×21×20]/24 + [23×22×21×20×19]/120.

Factor out [23×22×21×20]/24 from both terms.

So, let's compute the numerator:

23×22×21×20 × [1 + (19)/120] = 23×22×21×20 × (139/120).

Wait, but 23×22×21×20 × (139/120)?

Wait, this seems complicated, but perhaps I can compute it differently.

Alternatively, let's compute the sum:

C(23,4) + C(23,5) = C(24,5).

I remember that this is a standard identity: C(n, r) + C(n, r+1) = C(n+1, r+1). So if n=23, r=4, then this would be C(24,5). So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the sum of the k's is 5 + 19 = 24, which is option F.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options are given, and 24 is F, but another thought: maybe the question is asking for all possible k's, but only 5 and 19, so their sum is 24. So I think that's correct.

So the answer should be F:24.

The equation C(23,4) + C(23,5) = C(24,k) can be simplified using the identity C(n, r) + C(n, r+1) = C(n+1, r+1). Applying this with n=23 and r=4, we find C(24,5) = C(23,4) + C(23,5). Thus, k can be 5 or 19, as C(24,5) = C(24,19). The sum of these k's is 5 + 19 = 24, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
