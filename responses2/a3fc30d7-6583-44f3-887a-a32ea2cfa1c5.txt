Okay, so I have this math problem here: 1990 multiplied by 1991 minus 1989 multiplied by 1990. I need to figure out what counting number this equals. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I can rewrite the expression to make it easier to handle. I notice that both terms have a common factor of 1990. Let me factor that out. So, 1990 times (1991 minus 1989). That seems right because 1990 is a common factor in both terms.

Calculating the inside first: 1991 minus 1989. Let me subtract those. 1991 minus 1989 is 2. So now the expression simplifies to 1990 multiplied by 2. 

Wait, 1990 times 2 is straightforward. 1990 * 2 = 3980. So the result of the original expression is 3980. Let me check if that makes sense.

Alternatively, I could expand both terms to see if that confirms the result. Let's do that. 

1990 × 1991 is equal to 1990 × (1990 + 1) which is 1990² + 1990. Similarly, 1989 × 1990 is 1989 × 1990. 

Subtracting these two expressions: (1990² + 1990) - (1989 × 1990). Let's factor out 1990 from both terms. That gives 1990 × (1990 + 1 - 1989). 

Calculating inside the parentheses: 1990 + 1 is 1991, minus 1989 gives 2. So again, it's 1990 × 2 = 3980. That matches what I got earlier. 

Just to double-check, maybe I'll plug in the numbers as they are. 1990 × 1991 is a big number, but let me approximate. 2000 × 2000 is 4,000,000, so 1990 × 1991 is just a bit less, maybe around 3,980,000. Similarly, 1989 × 1990 is a bit less than 2,000,000, probably around 3,970,000. Subtracting them would give around 10,000, which doesn't make sense because 1990 × 2 is 3980. Wait, maybe my approximation isn't accurate enough. Let me do the actual multiplication.

Wait, 1990 × 1991 = (2000 - 10) × 1991 = 2000×1991 - 10×1991. 2000×1991 is 3,982,000, and 10×1991 is 19,910. So subtracting, 3,982,000 - 19,910 = 3,962,090.

Similarly, 1989 × 1990 = (2000 - 11) × 1990 = 2000×1990 - 11×1990. 2000×1990 is 3,980,000, and 11×1990 is 21,890. So subtracting, 3,980,000 - 21,890 = 3,958,110.

Now subtracting the two results: 3,962,090 - 3,958,110 = 3,980. Yep, that's the same as before. So the result is definitely 3980. 

Looking at the options, option B is 3980. So that's our answer.

The expression simplifies by factoring out 1990, leaving 2, which when multiplied by 1990 gives 3980. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 3980.

Answer: B
