Okay, so I've got this problem here. It's about dividing a set of 7 elements into 4 non-empty ordered subsets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on combinatorics, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that when you want to divide a set into subsets, it's related to something called Stirling numbers. Oh right, Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the ways to partition a set into non-empty subsets. But wait, this question says "ordered subsets," so I think that means the order matters. Oh right, that would change things. So it's not just about partitioning but about ordered partitions, which are also called "set partitions" but in different contexts.

Wait, wait. Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n,k), give the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty, unlabeled subsets. But since the subsets here are ordered, that's different. Oh right, I think the formula for that is S(n,k) multiplied by k! because each partition can be permuted in k! ways if the order matters.

So for this problem, n is 7 and k is 4. So I need to find S(7,4) and then multiply by 4! to account for the order.

I'm a bit confused about what S(7,4) is. Maybe I can recall the formula or find a way to compute it. Alternatively, I can think about it in terms of combinations.

Wait, another approach: the number of ordered partitions is equal to the number of equivalence relations on the set that have exactly 4 classes. So each element is assigned to one of 4 classes, and the order of the classes matters.

Wait, but no, that's more about the number of ordered partitions into exactly 4 non-empty subsets, considering the order. So yes, that would be S(n,k) multiplied by k!.

So first I need to find S(7,4). I'm not sure of the exact value, but maybe I can compute it using the recurrence relation for Stirling numbers.

Stirling numbers of the second kind satisfy the recurrence: S(n,k) = k * S(n-1,k) + S(n-1,k-1). Let me try to compute S(7,4) using this.

Alternatively, maybe there's a direct formula. Another way to compute it is using inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of onto functions from a set of size n to a set of size k is k! * S(n,k). So wait, no, that's the same thing. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Maybe I can compute S(7,4) using the formula for Stirling numbers:

S(n, k) = (1/k!) * sum_{i=0 to k} (-1)^(k-i) * C(k, i) * i^n}

Let me plug in n=7 and k=4.

So S(7,4) = (1/4!) [4^7 - C(4,1)*3^7 + C(4,2)*2^7 - C(4,3)*1^7 + C(4,4)*0^7]

Wait, but 0^7 is zero, so the last term is zero. So let's compute each term.

4! is 24.

Compute each term inside the sum:

Term 1: 4^7 = 16384

Term 2: C(4,1)*3^7 = 4 * 2187 = 8748

Term3: C(4,2)*2^7 = 6 * 128 = 768

Term4: C(4,3)*1^7 = 4 * 1 =4

So putting it all together:

sum = 16384 - 8748 + 768 -4

Compute step by step:

16384 -8748 = 7636

7636 +768 = 8404

8404 -4 = 8400

So sum is 8400. Now divide by 24: 8400 /24 = 350.

Wait, so S(7,4) is 350.

Then the number of ordered partitions is S(7,4) * 4! = 350 * 24.

350 *24: 350 *20=7000, 350 *4=1400 â†’ total 8400.

So the total number is 8400.

Looking at the options, option C is 8400. So the correct answer should be C.

The number of ways to divide 7 elements into 4 non-empty ordered subsets is calculated using the formula for Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n,k), multiplied by k! to account for order. S(7,4) is 350, and 350 * 24 = 8400, which is option C.
