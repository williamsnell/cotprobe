Okay, so I've got this question about interest calculation. Let's see, I need to figure out how much interest Paul will have to pay on a 60-day loan of $823 at 4% per year using the exact time method. Hmm, right.

Alright, I remember that the exact time method calculates interest based on the actual number of days the money is borrowed. So it's based on the actual days, not the number of months or anything. That makes sense because it's more accurate.

So, the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, right? Where I is interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. But since it's the exact time method, I need to calculate T based on the actual days.

The principal is $823. The rate is 4% per year. So R is 0.04. The time is 60 days. But wait, how do I calculate T?

I think T is the time in years. Since it's exact time, T = days / 365. So T would be 60 / 365. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 365... Let's see, 60 ÷ 365 ≈ 0.1644 years.

Now, I'll plug these into the formula. I = 823 * 0.04 * (60/365). Let's compute each part.

First, 823 multiplied by 0.04. 823 * 0.04 is 32.92. Then, multiply that by 60/365. So 32.92 * (60/365). Let's compute that.

Wait, 32.92 times 60 is 1975.2. Then divide by 365. So 1975.2 / 365 ≈ 5.416. Hmm, so approximately $5.42. But wait, let me double-check the calculation because I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should compute it step by step more accurately.

First, 823 * 0.04. Let's do 823 * 0.04. 823 * 4 is 3292, so 0.04 is 329.2? Wait, no, 823 * 0.04 is 32.92 because 800 * 0.04 is 32, and 23 * 0.04 is 0.92, so 32.92. That's correct.

Then, 32.92 multiplied by (60/365). Let me compute 32.92 * 60 first. 32.92 * 60 = 1975.2. Then divide by 365. 1975.2 / 365 equals approximately 5.416. So, about $5.42.

Looking at the options, option I is $5.41. So the answer should be I, $5.41. But wait, let me check if I made any calculation errors.

Wait, another approach: perhaps compute 60/365 as 0.16438356. Then 823 * 0.04 = 32.92. Multiply that by 0.16438356. So 32.92 * 0.16438356.

Hmm, 32.92 * 0.16 is 5.2672, and 32.92 * 0.00438356 is about 0.1448. Adding them gives approximately 5.412. So, about $5.41.

Wait, but the options have option I as 5.41, so that's probably correct. So the answer should be I.

The correct calculation for interest using the exact time method is approximately $5.41, which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I: $5.41
