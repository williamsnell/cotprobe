Okay, I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Let's try to figure it out. So the question is asking how many disintegrations per second occur in 100 grams of radium. The decay constant is given as 1.36 × 10^-11 per second. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the number of disintegrations per second is called the activity. Activity A is related to the decay constant λ and the number of atoms N by the formula A = λ*N. Right, so A equals lambda multiplied by N.

But wait, I don't have the number of atoms N. I know that the number of atoms in a substance is given by Avogadro's number multiplied by the number of moles. So N = N_A * n, where n is the number of moles.

Right, so I need to find n. Number of moles is mass divided by molar mass. Radium's molar mass is about 226 g/mol, I think. Let me double-check: Radium (Ra) has an atomic weight of about 226.02 g/mol. So moles n = 100g / 226.02 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

So 100 divided by 226.02 is approximately 0.442 moles. Oh wait, no, wait. 226 times 0.4 is 90.4, 0.44 would be 100.64, so 0.442 maybe? Let me do it properly. 226.02 multiplied by 0.442 is 226 * 0.442 ≈ 100. So n ≈ 0.442 moles.

So N = Avogadro's number (6.022e23) multiplied by 0.442. Let me compute that: 6.022e23 * 0.442 = approximately 2.66e23 atoms. Wait, wait, that's a lot of atoms. 

Now, activity A = λ * N. Lambda is 1.36e-11 per second. So A = 1.36e-11 * 2.66e23. Let's compute that. 1.36e-11 times 2.66e23. Let me multiply the coefficients: 1.36 * 2.66 is about 3.62 (because 1.36 * 2 is 2.72, 1.36 * 0.66 is about 0.8976, total around 3.6176). Then the exponent is 10^(-11 + 23) = 10^12. So A is approximately 3.62e12 dis/sec.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.62 × 10^12 dis/sec. So that's the answer.

To determine the number of disintegrations per second (activity) in 100 g of radium, we use the relationship \( A = \lambda N \), where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( N \) is the number of atoms. 

1. **Calculate the number of moles of radium**:  
   The molar mass of radium is approximately \( 226.02 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   \[
   n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{100 \, \text{g}}{226.02 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.442 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of atoms**:  
   Using Avogadro's number \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \),  
   \[
   N = n \cdot N_A = 0.442 \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.66 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms}
   \]

3. **Calculate the activity**:  
   The decay constant is \( \lambda = 1.36 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{s}^{-1} \).  
   \[
   A = \lambda \cdot N = 1.36 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 2.66 \times 10^{23} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{12} \, \text{dis/sec}
   \]

4. **Match the result with the options**:  
   The closest match is option **B: \( 3.62 \times 10^{12} \, \text{dis/sec} \)**.

Answer: B
