Okay, so I have this question about the least radiation frequency needed for positron-electron pair production. Hmm, I remember something from my physics class. Pair production usually refers to creating an electron-positron pair from a photon. Wait, but can a single photon do that? Oh right, I think it's a process that requires a certain energy, so the photon's frequency needs to be high enough.

I think the key here is the threshold frequency. Oh wait, the energy required for pair production must come from the photon's energy. The formula I remember is something like E = hν, where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula for pair production.

Wait, I think for pair production, the condition is that the photon's energy must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. Because each of them has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV. So the total rest mass energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV. Wait, but wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, pair production is when a photon converts into an electron-positron pair. So the energy needed is twice the rest energy of an electron. So E = 2 * (0.511 MeV). 

But wait, let me get this right. The energy of the photon must be at least 1.022 MeV. Because E = mc², and for an electron, m is 0.511 MeV/c². So two electrons would be 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the frequency, so I'll need to relate that energy to frequency. The formula is E = h * ν. So ν = E / h.

But what's the value of Planck's constant? Oh, right, h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But wait, the energy E is in Joules. But the options are given in terms of 10^20 per second, which is probably in Hz (since frequency is 1/sec). Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of MeV and frequency. Because I think the threshold frequency for pair production is often given in terms of 10^20 Hz. Let me recall some standard values.

I remember that the threshold frequency for pair production is about 1.022 x 10^20 Hz. But wait, wait, let me think. Because the rest energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So two electrons would require 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV. That's correct.

So E = 1.022 MeV. Then ν = E/h.

Wait, but h is in J·s. Let me convert MeV to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 1.602e-13 J.

So E = 1.022 MeV = 1.022 * 1.602e-13 J ≈ 1.637e-13 J.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ν = E/h = (1.637e-13) / (6.626e-34) ≈ let's calculate that.

1.637e-13 divided by 6.626e-34 is approximately (1.637/6.626) * 1e(13-34) → (0.247) * 1e21 → about 2.47e20 Hz.

Oh, wait, that's option B: 2.47 x 10^20 (1/sec).

Wait, but I thought the threshold frequency for pair production is about 1.02e20 Hz, but according to this calculation, it's 2.47e20 Hz. That doesn't make sense. Did I mix up the energy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's reconsider. Pair production requires the photon's energy to equal the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. So the total energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So yes, E is 1.022 MeV.

But wait, wait, another point: the photon's energy must be at least twice the electron rest energy. So E >= 2 m_e c^2 = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So that's correct.

But wait, the calculation of ν would be E/h. So E is 1.022 MeV which is 1.022 * 1.602e-13 J.

Wait, 1.022e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.022e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 1.637e-13 J.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ν = 1.637e-13 /6.626e-34 = let's compute this.

Divide 1.637 by 6.626 → approximately 0.247.

And exponents: 1e-13 / 1e-34 = 1e21. So 0.247e21 → 2.47e20 Hz.

So the correct answer is option B: 2.47 x 10^20 (1/sec). Because that's the threshold frequency for pair production.

Wait, but I remember that the minimum frequency needed for pair production can't be lower than a certain value because of the uncertainty principle. Oh wait, no, perhaps that's in the context of the photon having to have enough energy to produce the particles and their antiparticles without being absorbed. So the process requires the photon's energy to be at least 2 m_e c^2.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the least radiation frequency \( \nu \) capable of positron-electron pair production, we need to consider the energy required for this process. Pair production occurs when a photon's energy is sufficient to create an electron-positron pair. The total rest mass energy of the pair is \( 2m_e c^2 \), where \( m_e \) is the electron mass and \( c \) is the speed of light. For an electron, \( m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), so the total rest mass energy for the pair is \( 2 \times 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \).

The energy of the photon is related to its frequency by \( E = h \nu \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( \nu \) is the frequency in Hz. Converting \( 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \) to joules:  
\[
1.022 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \approx 1.637 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}.
\]

Solving for \( \nu \):  
\[
\nu = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{1.637 \times 10^{-13}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}} \approx 2.47 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Thus, the least radiation frequency required for positron-electron pair production is approximately \( 2.47 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz} \), which corresponds to option B.
