Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about an observer moving past a meter stick and what length they measure. Hmm, I remember something about relativity and how length contracts when measured in motion. But wait, I should think through it step by step.

The setup: the observer is moving at half the speed of light relative to the meter stick. The meter stick is at rest, I suppose. So from the observer's frame of reference, what happens?

Wait, the meter stick is 1 meter long in its own rest frame, right? Because that's what the problem states. But when someone moves past it, the length they measure should be shorter, right? Oh yeah, that's length contraction. The formula I recall is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (the rest length) and L is the measured length in another frame.

So here, the observer is moving at v = 0.5c. Let's compute the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging in v=0.5c, v² is 0.25c². So 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. The square root of 0.75 is about 0.866. So 1 over that is about 1.1547. Hmm, because sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.866, so sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) is sqrt(0.75) and the reciprocal is 1/sqrt(0.75) which is about 1.1547.

Wait, no, actually, because the formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), which is L0 multiplied by the gamma factor. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = approximately 1.1547. So the observed length is L = L0 * gamma. Since L0 is 1 m, the measured length should be about 1.1547 m, which is 115.47 centimeters.

Looking at the options, I don't see 115 cm. The options are from 50 cm up to 100 cm. Wait, the options are A to J, but their lengths are in cm. Oh wait, the options are A:60, B:90, C:80, D:95, E:65, F:86.6, G:70, H:75, I:50, J:100.

Wait, 115 cm isn't an option. Did I make a mistake?

Wait wait, perhaps I got the formula backward. Oh no, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So when the observer is moving, the length they measure is less than the rest length. Because they're the ones moving, their measurements are shorter.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let's compute the Lorentz factor correctly. For v = 0.5c, v² is 0.25c². So 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. The square root of 0.75 is approximately 0.866. So 1 divided by 0.866 is approximately 1.1547. So the measured length is L0 multiplied by gamma, which is 1.1547 m. That's approximately 115.47 cm.

But none of the options are 115 cm. The closest is option F:86.6 cm, which is approximately sqrt(0.75) because 86.6 is roughly 0.75 * (100 cm). Wait, no. Wait, 86.6 cm is the proper length, but wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula reversed.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. Let me double-check. So the length L observed is L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So indeed, the observed length is less than the proper length (the rest length). So in this case, with L0 =1 m, the observed length is about 1.1547 m, which is 115 cm. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recompute sqrt(0.75). Wait, sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So 1 / sqrt(0.75) is approximately 1.1547. So the observed length is approximately 1.1547 m, which is 115.47 cm. But the options don't include this. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A:60 cm

B:90 cm

C:80 cm

D:95 cm

E:65 cm

F:86.6 cm

G:70 cm

H:75 cm

I:50 cm

J:100 cm

So the correct calculation gives approximately 115.47 cm, but the closest option below is J:100 cm. Wait, but that's not correct because 100 cm is less than 115. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate. v = 0.5 c. So v²/c² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So 1 - v²/c² is 0.75. The square root of 0.75 is about 0.866. The reciprocal is about 1.1547. So L = 1 m * 1.1547 = 115.47 cm.

But there's no option for 115 cm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, another way to think about it: the length is contracted by a factor of gamma. So the observed length is L0 / gamma. So 1 m / 1.1547 ≈ 0.866 m, which is 86.6 cm. Oh! Oh, so I think I got confused. Because gamma is 1.1547, so L = L0 / gamma. So 1 / 1.1547 is approximately 0.866. So the observed length is about 86.6 cm, which is option F.

Ah, so that makes sense. So the correct answer is F:86.6 cm.

To determine the length measured by an observer moving past a meter stick at half the speed of light, we use the concept of length contraction from special relativity. The formula for the observed length \( L \) is:

\[
L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where:
- \( L_0 \) is the proper length (the rest length of the object, 1 meter in this case),
- \( v \) is the velocity of the observer relative to the object (0.5c),
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \)
For \( v = 0.5c \):
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2} = 0.25
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \)
\[
\sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Compute the observed length \( L \)
\[
L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 1 \, \text{m} \cdot 0.866 \approx 0.866 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Convert to centimeters
\[
0.866 \, \text{m} = 86.6 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the observer measures the meter stick to be approximately **86.6 cm long**. Among the given options, the closest match is **F: 86.6 cm**.
