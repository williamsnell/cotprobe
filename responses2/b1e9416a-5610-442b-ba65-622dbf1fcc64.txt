Okay, so I've got this question here about intelligence research and education. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is asking about what contemporary intelligence researchers like Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg are complaining about with schools. The options are A to J, each making a different point. Let me read each option carefully.

Option A: nonessential subjects like art and music. I think I've heard that schools are often criticized for focusing too much on subjects like math and science. But art and music are considered essential for creativity and emotional expression, right? So maybe this isn't what they're complaining about.

Option B: fostering collaborative learning environments. I remember reading that collaboration is important for learning. When students work together, they can share ideas and learn from each other. I think some researchers are concerned that schools are not doing enough in this area, which could lead to lower academic performance.

Option C: traditional subjects and methods. This seems more like a general criticism of schools. They might be suggesting that the way subjects are taught is outdated and not best for student development. But I'm not sure if they specifically point out collaboration as a problem.

Option D: promoting physical education and sports. I don't know much about this, but I think some studies suggest that physical education isn't as important as they believe. Maybe they're saying that schools spend too much time on physical activities, which isn't the main focus for cognitive development.

Option E: cultivating social intelligence. Social intelligence is about understanding social interactions, relationships, and teamwork. I think some researchers believe that schools are not adequately preparing students for social situations, so they want to encourage more social skills through activities like group projects and teamwork.

Option F: the development of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is about understanding and managing emotions and relationships. I'm not sure if this is something they specifically complain about, or if it's more of a separate concern. But I think emotional intelligence is important, but perhaps the focus is elsewhere.

Option G: individual learning styles and preferences. This rings a bell. Howard Gardner, the author, talked about different learning styles, like visual, auditory, kinesthetic, etc. He believed that students should be taught in ways that cater to their individual learning preferences. So if schools are focused on teaching in a way that doesn't consider these styles, that's a problem.

Option H: encouraging creative thought. Creative thinking is a big part of intelligence, especially in fields like art, music, and science. But I'm not sure if the focus is on encouraging creativity or if it's more about how it's taught.

Option I: the use of technology in education. I've heard that technology can be a double-edged sword. While it can assist with learning, there are concerns about it being used too much in the classroom and not being used effectively. So maybe schools are worried about the benefits of technology.

Option J: the environmental factors that influence the expression of intelligence. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. Environmental factors like the school environment, resources, etc., might influence intelligence, but I'm not certain this is a specific complaint cited by these researchers.

Now, the question is about what they're complaining about. So I need to think about each option and see which ones are common criticisms.

From what I remember, Howard Gardner and Sternberg are critical of traditional education, often focusing too much on certain subjects and methods. They might be concerned about the neglect of collaborative learning, teaching methods, and perhaps the lack of individualized learning approaches.

Robert Sternberg, in particular, is known for his work on intelligence as a construct and the idea that intelligence isn't fixed but can change with environment and learning. He might be advocating for more holistic education, including the development of social and emotional intelligence, which ties into options E and F.

Wait, but the question is about what they're complaining about. So looking back, option G is about individual learning styles. If they're worried that schools don't cater to different learning styles, that's a point they might make.

Option B is about collaborative learning. I think that's a common criticism. Schools often emphasize individual study, but maybe they neglect group work, which is essential for teamwork and collaboration.

So the question is which is more aligned with the researchers' complaints. Let me think about each.

The question lists 'contemporary intelligence researchers' as the focus. So if they are critical, they might point out that schools focus too much on certain subjects (like math) and not enough on others, or perhaps not enough on collaborative learning.

Option B suggests fostering collaborative learning. That seems like a problem because collaborative learning is seen as more effective for developing social skills and teamwork, which are important for overall intelligence.

Option G is about individual learning styles. That's a valid point, but I'm not sure if the question is specifically pointing to that as the main complaint. Alternatively, maybe the researchers are more concerned about the lack of collaborative learning.

Wait, the question is phrased as 'complains that schools focus too much on' which option. So the options are alternatives to the current focus. So if the current focus is on certain subjects, and they're saying schools are not doing enough, then which option aligns with that?

I think the main point is collaboration. For example, schools may not be as effective when students are working in groups rather than individually. So option B could be the answer.

Alternatively, looking at each option again. Option G is about individual learning styles. If the researchers are complaining that schools are not considering individual differences, maybe they are saying that schools don't cater to different learning styles, so they should promote more varied teaching methods. That could be a valid point, but I think the question is more about the focus being on collaboration or other areas.

Another point: the question is about what they're complaining about. So if they are concerned that schools are not fostering collaborative learning, that's option B. If they are worried about the lack of individualized approaches, it's G.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of the possible answers. The options are A to J, and the question is which is a complaint they make.

So, for example, Howard Gardner and Sternberg might be concerned about schools not encouraging collaborative learning, which is option B.

Alternatively, they might focus on individual learning styles (G). But I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, but looking back, I think that the main issue is encouraging collaborative learning, which is option B. Because, as per some sources, schools often neglect collaborative learning, which is vital for developing social skills and teamwork. So the researchers might say that schools focus too much on non-essential subjects and don't foster collaborative learning, leading to lower academic performance. So the answer would be B.

The question asks about the contemporary intelligence researchers' complaints regarding schools' focus. Analysis of the options reveals the following:

- **Option A**: Fails because art and music are considered essential, not nonessential.
- **Option B**: Focuses on fostering collaborative learning, which is a common criticism.
- **Option C**: General criticism of traditional subjects, not specifically about collaboration.
- **Option D**: Promotes physical education, which may not be the primary focus.
- **Option E**: Emphasizes social intelligence, a valid concern.
- **Option F**: Relates to emotional intelligence, which isn't the main point cited by these researchers.
- **Option G**: Concerns individual learning styles, but the question asks about collaboration.
- **Option H**: Focuses on technology's role in education, which isn't the primary issue.
- **Option I**: Risks overusing technology, which is a concern.
- **Option J**: Involves environmental factors, not specifically about intelligence focus.

The researchers are likely complaining about schools not fostering collaborative learning, as this is a critical aspect of intelligence development. Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

**ANSWER: B**
