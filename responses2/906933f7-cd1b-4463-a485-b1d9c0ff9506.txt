Question:

An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6- bit sequences?

Options:

A: 10 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
B: 2 more items can be uniquely identified.
C: 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
D: The number of uniquely identified items will remain the same.
E: 3 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
F: Half as many items can be uniquely identified.
G: 128 more items can be uniquely identified.
H: 10 more items can be uniquely identified.
I: 4 times as many items can be uniquely identified.

Okay, so I've got this question about binary sequences for an online store. Hmm, let's think through it. The question is about the difference in the number of unique items that can be identified when using 6-bit vs. 7-bit sequences. 

First, I remember that each bit in a binary number represents a power of two. So, a 6-bit sequence can represent 2^6 possible unique combinations. Let me calculate that. 2^6 is 64. So there are 64 different 6-bit numbers.

Now, a 7-bit sequence would be 2^7, right? 2^7 is 128. So, using 7 bits gives us 128 different unique sequences. 

The question is about how this affects the number of items that can be uniquely identified. If we go from 6 bits (64) to 7 bits (128), how many times as many items can we now uniquely identify? Well, 128 is double 64, so the number of unique items doubles.

Looking at the options, option I says it's 4 times as many. Wait, no. 128 is exactly two times 64. So the increase factor would be 2 times. Option C is 2 times as many, which matches. Let me double-check the other options to be sure.

Option A: 10 times. That's way too high. 64 to 128 is just a factor of 2, not 10. So A is incorrect.

Option B: 2 more items. That doesn't make sense. The number of unique items isn't increased by 2; it's multiplied by 2. So B is wrong.

Option D says the number remains the same. No, because 128 is more than 64, so D is wrong.

Option E: 3 times as many. 128 is not three times 64. 64*3 is 192, which is more than 128. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Half as many. Hmm, wait. 128 is twice 64, so it's actually double, not half. So F is wrong.

Option G: 128 more. That's not correct because the number of items is about the capacity, not the difference. So G is incorrect.

Option H: 10 more. Again, 10 is wrong. 128 is double. So H is incorrect.

Option I: 4 times. Wait, 64 to 128 is 128/64=2. So that's a two-fold increase, not four times. So I is also incorrect.

Wait, wait. Did I make a mistake here? Because 6 bits give 64, 7 bits 128. So 128 is 2 times 64, so the number of items doubles. So the correct answer should be option C: 2 times as many.

But wait, let me go back. The initial question says, "the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences." So the increase is from 64 to 128. So 128 is 2 times 64. So the number can be uniquely identified 2 times as many. So C is right.

Wait, but another thought: 6 bits can represent 64 unique items, 7 bits 128. So using 7 bits allows for twice as many. So the answer is C.

The question compares the number of unique items that can be identified using 6-bit and 7-bit binary sequences. A 6-bit sequence represents 2^6 = 64 unique items, while a 7-bit sequence represents 2^7 = 128 unique items. This means the 7-bit system can uniquely identify twice as many items as the 6-bit system. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option C (2 times)** is correct because 128 is twice 64.
- Other options either overstate the increase (e.g., 10 times for option I) or incorrectly state a different relationship (e.g., doubling but not four times for option I).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
