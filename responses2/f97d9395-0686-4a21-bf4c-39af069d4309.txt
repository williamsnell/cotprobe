Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities, especially due to work intensification and tech shifts. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I'll read the question carefully. It's asking about the employee's preferred ratio. The options include things like Work-leisure ratio, Work-life balance, etc. Let me think about each option.

Option A is Work-leisure ratio. That sounds like it's about the proportion of time spent on work vs. leisure. That directly relates to the issue of people balancing work and personal time, which fits because the question mentions intensification of work and tech shifts, making such a ratio contested.

Option B is Employee engagement. That's more about how engaged employees are in the workplace, not necessarily their time allocation between work and non-work activities.

Option C is Work-health balance. That's similar to A but maybe more focused on the health aspect, not just the ratio.

Option D is Work-stress balance. Stress can come from work, and this might be a hot topic too, but it's more about stress levels rather than the allocation between work and non-work.

Option E is Work-management. That's about how work is managed rather than the time allocation.

Option F is Work-life balance. This is a broader term that includes various aspects like work and personal life. It's about the overall balance, which could encompass both work-related and non-work activities.

Option G is Presenteeism. That's a term used in some cultures about being present at work, not necessarily about time allocation between work and non-work.

Option H is Job satisfaction. This is more about the employee's personal satisfaction in their job, not their time management.

Option I is Work-play balance. Work and play are often considered complementary. It's about balancing work with personal interests, which could relate to the time spent on non-work activities.

Option J is Absenteeism. That's about not showing up for work, which is a form of non-work activity but not the same as the ratio the question is about.

So, the question is about the ratio between work-related and non-work. Work-life balance encompasses this, but it's broader. Work-play balance is more about time allocation between work and personal time. The issue is about the preferred ratio between them.

Wait, but the options available include F: Work-life balance. That's a more general term. Alternatively, the question mentions intensification of work and tech shifts, which could mean people are working longer hours and not spending as much time on non-work activities. So, perhaps the preferred ratio is about how people currently allocate their timeâ€”could be more towards work, more towards non-work, or perhaps a preferred mix.

Looking at the options, the answer is likely F: Work-life balance. Because Work-life balance is the term that directly refers to the ratio between work and personal time. It's a hot topic because people are often more focused on work and less on personal time, especially as work intensity increases.

Wait, but another thought: Work-life balance is a broader term, encompassing various aspects. The question is specifically about the ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. So, Work-life balance might be the right term because it's the overall balance, but the question is more about the specific ratio.

Alternatively, Work-life balance could be interpreted as the idea that people should work and play their lives, which includes work-related and non-work activities. Maybe the preferred ratio is about this balance. So, perhaps F is the answer.

Alternatively, Work-leisure ratio (A) is a specific term for the proportion between work and leisure. But the question is about the employee's ratio, which might be a more general concept.

Wait, the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." So, the correct answer is F, which has the last letter as F. So, the answer is F.

The correct answer is F: Work-life balance. This term refers to the proportionate allocation of time between work and non-work activities, which aligns with the question's focus on the employee's preferred ratio.

Answer: F
