Question:

Which of the following is the proper treatment of the cost of equipment used in research and development activities that will have alternative future uses?

Options:

A: Capitalized and depreciated over the term of the research and development project.
B: Expensed as incurred, regardless of the project's term or future use.
C: Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.
D: Expensed in the year in which the research and development project started.
E: Either capitalized or expensed, but not both, depending on the term of the research and development project.
F: Capitalized but not depreciated.
G: Capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the research and development project, unless the equipment has no alternative future uses.
H: Either capitalized or expensed, depending on the potential success of the research and development project.
I: Expensed in the year in which the research and development project is completed.

Okay, so I have this accounting question here about equipment used in research and development (R&D) activities. The question is about how to treat the cost of such equipment in terms of depreciation. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that in accounting, when you use equipment for projects that could have alternative uses, you have to consider whether to depreciate it or expense it. The key here is whether the equipment will be used for more than one use or if it's meant to be sold or replaced.

I recall that the rule is that if the equipment is expected to have alternative future uses, it should be capitalized and depreciated. That is, the cost isn't expensed immediately but spread out over its useful life. If the equipment is meant to be sold or replaced, it's expensed in the year it's used.

Looking at the options:

A: Capitalized and depreciated over the term of the research and development project. That sounds right because the term suggests it's expected to have alternative uses.

B: Expensed as incurred regardless of term. That might be incorrect because if the project is part of a larger R&D, the cost should be capitalized to account for its useful life.

C: Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life. That's similar to A, but the wording is a bit different. It says "term of the project," which could be ambiguous, but I think A implies using the project's term.

D: Expensed in the year it starts. That doesn't make sense because if it's used for more than one purpose, it should be capitalized.

E: Either capitalize or expense, but not both. Hmm, I'm not sure about this. Maybe if the project is not expected to have alternative uses, it's expensed. But I'm not certain if it's either or both, or if it's only one of them.

F: Capitalized but not depreciated. No, that's incorrect because the equipment should be depreciated as it's used.

G: Capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful life. Similar to A and C.

H: Either capitalize or expense depending on success. I'm not sure about this. I thought the decision is based on whether it has alternative uses, not on the project's success.

I: Expensed when completed. No, because if it's meant to be sold, it should be depreciated.

So, the correct treatment is to capitalize and depreciate it unless it has no alternative uses. That matches option G and A. But looking at the options, option G says "capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life." Option A is similar but says "term of the project."

Wait, the question says, "the proper treatment of the cost of equipment used in R&D activities that will have alternative future uses." So the equipment is intended for more than one purpose. So the treatment is capitalized and depreciated over its useful life. That's option G.

Wait, but some sources say that if the equipment is not expected to be sold or replaced, it's expensed in the year it's used. So if it's capitalized, it's depreciated. So the correct answer is G: capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.

Looking at the options, option G is exactly that.

Wait, let me check the options again:

A: Capitalized and depreciated over the term of the project.

C: Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.

G: Capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life.

So the wording is a bit different. Option G is more precise in saying "estimated useful life," which is probably better because sometimes useful lives are uncertain.

So the correct answer should be option G.

The proper treatment of the cost of equipment used in R&D activities that will have alternative future uses is to capitalize and depreciate it over its estimated useful life. This is because the equipment is intended for more than one purpose and should be accounted for as an asset with a depreciated value.

The correct answer is:

**G: Capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the research and development project, unless the equipment has no alternative future uses.**

**Answer:** G
