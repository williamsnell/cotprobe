Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says that x is 0.3168, and I need to find the value of x multiplied by this infinite product and then divided by the sine of x. So the expression is x * [product from n=1 to infinity of (1 - (x²/(n²π²)))] / sin(x). Hmm, I remember something about infinite products and maybe it relates to some function I've heard of before.

Wait, the product looks familiar. Oh right, it's related to the sine function. I think there's a formula involving the sine of a multiple angle. Let me recall: I think the infinite product for sine can be written as something like sin(x) equals x multiplied by an infinite product of terms like (1 - (x²/(n²π²))). Oh wait, that's exactly the product in the problem! So the product is [sin(x)] / x multiplied by x. Wait, let me think again. The product is (1 - x²/(n²π²)) for n from 1 to infinity. So the product is [sin(x)] / x. Because the infinite product for sin(x) is x * product_{n=1}^\infty (1 - x²/(n²π²)). Oh right, so that means the product in the problem is sin(x)/x.

So substituting that into the expression, we have x multiplied by (sin(x)/x) divided by sin(x). Let me write that out: x * [sin(x)/x] / sin(x). Simplify this. The x in the numerator and the x in the denominator cancel out, leaving [sin(x)/x] / sin(x). Wait, that simplifies to [1/x] [sin(x)/sin(x)]? Or wait, actually, [sin(x)/x] divided by sin(x) is [sin(x)/x] * [1/sin(x)] which is 1/x. But wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 1/x as a possible answer. Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute. The expression is x multiplied by [product (1 - x²/(n²π²))], which is x * [sin(x)/x], all divided by sin(x). So it's [x * (sin(x)/x)] / sin(x). Simplify numerator: x cancels with 1/x, so you have [sin(x)] / sin(x) = 1. So the entire expression is 1. But wait, none of the options say 1. Hmm, let me check the options again.

The options are A:1.5, B:1.0, C:2.0, D:1.732, E:-1.0, F:0.5, G:0.0, H:0.3168, I:2.5, J:3.14. So option B is 1.0. So the answer would be B, 1.0.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. The product is (sin x)/x, so the expression is x * (sin x/x) divided by sin x. Let me compute numerator: x * (sin x/x) = sin x. Then divide by sin x: sin x / sin x = 1. So yes, the result is 1.0. So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves evaluating the expression \( x \cdot \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2 \pi^2}\right) / \sin(x) \) with \( x = 0.3168 \).

1. **Identify the Infinite Product**: The product \( \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2 \pi^2}\right) \) is a known infinite product related to the sine function. Specifically, the infinite product for \( \sin(x) \) is:
   \[
   \sin(x) = x \cdot \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2 \pi^2}\right)
   \]
   Rearranging this, we find:
   \[
   \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2 \pi^2}\right) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
   \]

2. **Substitute the Product into the Expression**: Replacing the product in the given expression:
   \[
   x \cdot \frac{\sin(x)}{x} / \sin(x)
   \]
   Simplify the terms:
   - The \( x \) in the numerator and denominator cancel out.
   - \( \sin(x) \) in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving 1.

3. **Final Result**: The entire expression simplifies to 1.0.
