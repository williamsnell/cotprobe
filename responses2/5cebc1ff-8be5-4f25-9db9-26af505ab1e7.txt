Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the conflict Delia faces. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand. The question says that Delia is accepted into both Harvard and Yale and is having trouble choosing which school to attend. The options given are various types of psychological conflict, like approach-avoidance or reward-punishment.

Hmm, I remember that approach-avoidance is a conflict between wanting to go for one thing and avoiding the other. Like, maybe Delia wants Harvard because she likes it, but Yale is more appealing to her, so she avoids Yale. That makes sense for a decision between two options.

Looking at the options, option G is approach-avoidance. Option E is frustration-aggression, which sounds more like a personality type conflict. Delia is probably feeling frustration because of the dilemma and maybe avoiding Yale because of it, which would be approach-avoidance.

Wait, but what about other options? Option A is cognitive-dissonance, which is more about balancing needs and satisfactions. Delia is making a choice, not necessarily balancing needs, so I think cognitive-dissonance isn't the right fit. Option B is intrinsic-extrinsic, which is about personal motivations, not a conflict choice is facing.

Option D is internal-external, which I think refers to internal rewards versus external rewards. Delia might feel internal satisfaction from Harvard but external satisfaction from Yale, so that's about internal vs external rewards, which is similar to approach-avoidance. But I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Option F is approach-avoidance, which seems to fit because she's choosing between two options, facing a conflict between wanting one and avoiding the other. Option I is passive-aggressive, which would be a style issue, not a conflict between choices.

So, Delia is making a decision, which is a choice between two options, leading to an approach-avoidance conflict. So the correct answer should be G.

Delia is facing an approach-avoidance conflict because she's choosing between two schools, which involves wanting one and avoiding the other. This aligns with approach-avoidance.

Answer: G
