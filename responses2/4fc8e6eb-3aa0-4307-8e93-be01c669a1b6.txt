Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out how many floors a building has. Let me read it again. Each story is 14.3 feet tall, and the total height of the building is 185.9 feet. I need to find out how many floors that is. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 10 to 18.

Hmm, I think I need to divide the total height by the height per story to get the number of stories. Let me do that. So 185.9 divided by 14.3. Let me calculate that.

First, I'll set up the division: 185.9 รท 14.3. Maybe I can approximate this or do it step by step. Alternatively, I can use a calculator method, but since I'm trying to do this manually, I'll think of it as multiplying both numbers to make it easier.

Wait, maybe I can estimate. 14.3 times 13 is 14.3*10=143, 14.3*3=42.9, so 143 +42.9=185.9. Oh, wait, that's exactly the total height! So 14.3 multiplied by 13 is 185.9. That means there are 13 stories. So the number of floors should be 13, which is option H.

But wait, let me make sure. Each story is 14.3 feet. So 13 stories would be 13*14.3. Let me calculate that to confirm. 14.3*10 = 143, 14.3*3=42.9, so 143 +42.9 = 185.9. Yep, matches the building's height. So 13 floors. Looking back at the options, H is 13, so the answer should be H.

The number of floors is calculated by dividing the total height by the height per story: 185.9 รท 14.3 = 13. Therefore, the building has 13 floors.

Answer: H
