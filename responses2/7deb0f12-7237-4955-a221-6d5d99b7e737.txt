Okay, so I have this question about when cyber security discourse started. Hmm, I remember that the internet was becoming more prominent in the mid-20th century. Let me think about the timeline. 

I know that in the 1980s, tech was rapidly advancing. The first personal computers and the internet started to emerge, which would be the late '70s and early '80s. Then, the 1990s would see the rise of the internet as a global phenomenon. 

Cybersecurity was definitely around during that time. There were discussions about protecting personal data, especially with the rise of personal computers. Also, the 9/11 attacks in 2001 started to highlight the importance of secure communication, which ties into cybersecurity. 

So, putting it together, the cyber security discourse likely began in the 1980s, maybe around 1984. That fits with the options given. Let me check the options again. Option C is 1980s, which would be 1984-1990. Option E is 2000s, which is 2001 onwards. But considering the mid-20th century, the 1980s seems more accurate for when cyber security started being seriously discussed. 

Wait, but some sources might say it started earlier, like in the 1980s, but others might say the 1990s. I'm a bit fuzzy. Oh wait, the question is about when it emerged, so the start of the period when the majority began talking seriously. The 1980s would be when the internet was becoming widespread, so the discussions would have started then. 

So the answer is C: 1980s.

The cyber security discourse emerged during the 1980s, specifically around 1984. This period saw the rapid rise of the internet and the beginning of discussions about data security and privacy, which are critical components of modern cybersecurity practices.
