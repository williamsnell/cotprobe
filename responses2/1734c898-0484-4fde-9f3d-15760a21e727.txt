Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is that an employee arrives at work in the morning and finds his boss on the floor, and the boss didn't breathe. The employee then does CPR to revive the boss. Two weeks later, the boss comes back to work. The boss is grateful for the employee's quick action and tells the employee, "You'll have a job with me for life." Now, the question is about the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that day.

Let me think about what each option is saying.

Option A says that the employee's action gave the boss insufficient consideration to support his promise. Hmm, I remember that for a gift, the employee's action (rendering CPR) might be considered a gift, not a contract. Gifts usually don't require consideration, but if the employee was paid for the CPR, that would be a contract. But here, the employee only provided CPR, not any money. So maybe A is not correct because the employee didn't receive anything in return.

Option B claims the boss had a duty to pay reasonable compensation based on a contract implied-in-fact. Well, if the employee was paid for the CPR, that's a contract. But if the employee didn't get paid, it's not a duty. So if the employee didn't receive anything, the boss's promise doesn't require any consideration. So B might not be right because the employee didn't get paid, so no consideration.

Option C suggests the employee had a valid enforceable contract because of the boss's promise. But if the employee didn't receive any money, this can't be the case. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says the employee's act was a legally enforceable contract. But again, since the employee didn't get paid, it's not a contract. So D is incorrect.

Option E states that the employee's action was past consideration, making the boss's promise enforceable. Wait, past consideration is when a third party paid for the service. Here, the employee is the one paying for the CPR. So yes, the employee's actions (rendering CPR) are past consideration. That makes the promise enforceable. So E sounds correct.

Option F says the promise is voidable because of no consideration. But no, the employee didn't receive anything, so consideration doesn't exist. So F is incorrect.

Option G claims the act was a gift and didn't create an obligation. Gifts don't create obligations, so G is not right.

Option H says the promise is voidable due to lack of consideration. Yes, because there was no money, the consideration is lacking. So H is correct.

Option I says the boss had an enforceable lifetime employment contract. That's a different type of contract. This is more about the employee's actions providing a service, but the boss's promise is about employment, not the employee's actions. So I's probably not correct.

Option J says the boss had no legal obligation. But the employee's action made the promise enforceable, so J is wrong.

Wait, so E and H both seem correct. But looking back, the question is about the relationship on that day.

The employee provided CPR, which was a gift. So no consideration. So the boss's promise requires consideration, which the employee didn't provide. Therefore, E is correct because the employee's past actions ( gift ) were enough consideration. But H is also correct because the promise is voidable due to lack of consideration. Hmm, wait, but which option is the best fit?

The question is about the legal relationship between the boss and the employee. So the employee's act rendered the boss's promise enforceable. So E says the employee's act was past consideration, making the promise enforceable. H says the promise is voidable due to lack of consideration. Wait, but E is correct because the employee's action was past consideration, and H is correct because the promise is voidable.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

E says the employee's action was past consideration, making the promise enforceable. So yes, E is correct.

H says the promise is voidable due to lack of consideration. That's true because the employee was not paid for the CPR. So both options E and H seem correct. But the options are exclusive, so which one is correct?

In the law, a gift can sometimes be considered a contract if the employee received something in return. But in this case, the employee didn't receive anything except for the physical act (CPR). But in some jurisdictions, the employee might have been paid, but the question doesn't mention payment. It just says the employee rendered CPR. So the employee didn't get paid, so there's no consideration. Thus, the promise is voidable because there was no consideration. So H is correct.

Wait, but is the employee's action a gift? For example, if the employee was paid for the CPR, then yes, it's a gift. But without payment, it's not. So the employee's action was a gift, which is not a contract because no consideration. So the promise is voidable because there was no consideration. Thus, H is correct.

But the question is about the relationship between the boss and the employee. So when the employee provided the CPR, the boss's promise to provide a lifetime employment became enforceable.

So which options address that?

E says the employee's past consideration made the promise enforceable. So E would be correct because the employee's act (rendering CPR) was past consideration, fulfilling the condition for the promise.

H says the promise is voidable because of lack of consideration. Both E and H are correct, but looking for which is the best answer.

Wait, I think the best answer is E because it's a direct cause. The employee's past action provided the necessary consideration, making the promise enforceable. So E is correct.

But then again, H is also correct. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the question is about the legal relationship. The employee's act rendered the promise enforceable. So the correct answer would be H because it's about the promise being voidable. Wait, no. If the promise is voidable because there was no consideration, then the employee's action was sufficient to make it enforceable. So the correct answer is E because the employee's past consideration made the promise enforceable.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about the law. The key here is whether the employee's actions constitute past consideration. The employee rendered CPR, which was a service. So yes, that's past consideration. So the promise became enforceable.

Thus, the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the relationship between the boss and the employee. So when the employee provided the CPR, the boss's promise to provide a lifetime employment became enforceable. So the employee's past actions made the promise enforceable. So E is correct.

But H says the promise is voidable due to lack of consideration. That's also correct. Because the employee didn't get paid.

Wait, but if the employee didn't get paid, then H is correct. But the question is about the relationship, which is about whether the promise is enforceable. So the answer is E, because the employee's past consideration made the promise enforceable.

Wait, but the employee's action (rendering CPR) was past consideration. So the correct answer is E.

But wait, the options are:

E: The employee's act of saving the boss's life was past consideration, making the boss's promise enforceable.

H: The promise is voidable due to lack of consideration.

So both are correct? But the options are separate. The correct answer is E.

Wait, but I thought the employee's act rendered the promise enforceable, so E is correct. So the answer should be E. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, is the employee's act considered a gift, and the boss's promise is voidable because it's a gift?

Wait, no. Because a gift isn't a contract unless there's consideration. So the employee's act (rendering CPR) was a gift, but without consideration, the promise is voidable. So both E and H are correct. But looking at the options, the choices are E and H.

Wait, but the question is about the relationship. So the correct answer would be E because the employee's past consideration made the promise enforceable.

Alternatively, the correct answer is E because the employee's actions were past consideration, making the promise enforceable.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let's think again.

When the employee provided CPR, he provided past consideration. So the boss's promise was made, but it required consideration. So the employee's action was sufficient to make the promise enforceable. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

So the employee's act was past consideration, making the promise enforceable. So E is correct and H is correct as well, but the question is about the relationship.

Wait, but what's the question exactly? It asks for the best characterizing the legal relationship between the boss and employee on that date.

So E and H are both correct statements, but the options are separate. The question is whether the employee's act made the promise enforceable, making the boss's promise enforceable.

So E is correct because the employee's action was past consideration.

H is correct because the promise is voidable without consideration.

So the correct answer would be E.
</think>

The scenario involves an employee providing CPR to their boss, which rendered the boss's promise to offer a lifetime employment contract enforceable. The question is about the legal relationship between the boss and employee on the day the employee acted.

- **Option E**: The employee's act provided past consideration, making the boss's promise enforceable. This is correct because the employee's actions (rendering CPR) were a service rendered in the past, fulfilling the condition for the contract.

- **Option H**: The promise is voidable due to lack of consideration. This is also correct because the employee did not receive any payment, creating a lack of consideration for the promise.

Both E and H are correct, but the question asks for the best characterization of the relationship. Since the employee's actions made the promise enforceable, E is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses the enforceability of the promise.

ANSWER: E
