Okay, so I've got this physics question about two infinite parallel metal plates with equal surface charge density. Hmm, I need to find the electric field in the gap between them. The options are various relationships between this field and other factors.

Wait, what do I remember about electric fields between conductors? Oh right, when you have two parallel conducting plates with charges, the electric field in the space between them depends on the charge density. I think if the plates are the same and have the same polarity, they'll repel each other, but that's more about the force between them.

But the question is about the electric field in the gap. For a single infinite plate with charge, the electric field is sigma/(2 epsilon_0), right? Because each plate contributes half of that field on either side. So if you have two plates, each contributing their own field in the gap, do they add up or cancel out?

Wait, if both are positively charged, their fields would be in the same direction. Like, each plate has a field pointing away from itself. So two plates with the same charge would have their fields adding up. So the total field would be sigma/(epsilon_0), because each plate's field is sigma/(2 epsilon_0), so two of them add to sigma/epsilon_0.

So the field in the gap would be E = sigma/(epsilon_0) because each plate contributes ½ sigma/(epsilon_0), and they add. So that's the field in the gap. Now, the question is, how does this compare to the options given.

Looking at the options, option J says it's the same as produced by one plate. Wait, no, because one plate's field is sigma/(2 epsilon_0), so two plates would give sigma/epsilon_0. So the gap field is twice that of a single plate. Oh wait, wait a second. No, wait. Let me think again.

No, wait, the field from each plate is sigma/(2 epsilon_0). So two plates would add up to sigma/(epsilon_0). So the field in the gap is sigma/(epsilon_0), which is double that of a single plate. So the field in the gap is twice as strong as that of one plate. So option J says same as one plate's. That can't be right.

Wait, another possibility: when you have two plates with the same charge, their fields in the region between them would add up. So each plate's field is (sigma)/(2 epsilon_0), but in the same direction. So adding them: sigma/(2 epsilon_0) + sigma/(2 epsilon_0) = sigma/epsilon_0. So the field in the gap is sigma/(epsilon_0) which is twice as much as a single plate's field.

So the question is, what's the electric field in the gap? So for each plate, the field is sigma/(2 epsilon_0). So two plates would have their fields add up, so E = sigma/(epsilon_0).

Looking at the options, option J says same as one plate. So that's incorrect. What about other options?

Option F says quadruple the field from one plate. No, because sigma is the same, so F is sigma/(epsilon_0) *4, not sigma/epsilon_0. So F is incorrect.

Option I is triple, which is no. Option G is double. So, that would match our calculation. So E is sigma/(epsilon_0), which is double the field from one plate. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but option J is same as one, which is wrong. So the answer isn't J.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if the plates are the same and have the same polarity, does that affect the field?

Hmm, no, I think that's correct. Because each plate's field is sigma/(2 epsilon_0), so two add up.

Alternatively, think about the field between two plates. The field is uniform and same on both sides. So yes, the gap field is sigma/(epsilon_0). So J says it's same as one plate, which is wrong.

So the options are:

A: inversely proportional — no, because it's a constant.

B: quadruple — no.

C: zero — no.

D: depends on plate thickness — no, because the thickness doesn't matter for two infinite plates.

E: depends on field point — no, because the field is same everywhere in the gap.

F: quadruple — no.

G: double — yes, that's correct.

H: half — no.

I: triple — no.

J: same as one plate — no.

So the correct answer is G.

The electric field in the gap between two infinite parallel metal plates with equal surface charge density of the same polarity can be determined by analyzing the contributions from each plate. Each plate produces a field of \( \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \), where \( \sigma \) is the surface charge density and \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space. Since both plates have the same polarity, their fields in the gap add up, resulting in a total electric field of \( \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \).

Now, evaluating the options:

- **A: inversely proportional to the distance between the plates.**  
  This is incorrect because the electric field in the gap is uniform and does not depend on the distance between the plates.

- **B: quadruple the field produced by one plate.**  
  This is incorrect because the field in the gap is twice that of a single plate.

- **C: zero.**  
  This is incorrect because the plates are charged and repel each other, but this does not affect the electric field in the gap.

- **D: dependent on the thickness of the plates.**  
  This is incorrect because the thickness of the plates does not influence the electric field in the gap, which is uniform and constant.

- **E: dependent on coordinates of field points.**  
  This is incorrect because the electric field in the gap is uniform, so it does not depend on the specific coordinates of the field points.

- **F: quadruple the field produced by one plate.**  
  This is incorrect because the field in the gap is twice that of a single plate.

- **G: double the field produced by one plate.**  
  This is correct because the field in the gap is the sum of the fields from both plates, resulting in \( \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \), which is twice the field of a single plate.

- **H: half the field produced by one plate.**  
  This is incorrect because the field in the gap is twice that of a single plate.

- **I: triple the field produced by one plate.**  
  This is incorrect because the field in the gap is twice that of a single plate.

- **J: same as that produced by one plate.**  
  This is incorrect because the field in the gap is twice that of a single plate.

Thus, the correct answer is **G**, as the electric field in the gap is double that of the field produced by one plate.
