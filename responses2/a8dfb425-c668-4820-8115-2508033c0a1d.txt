Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which member of the paramyxovirus family causes very serious croup. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about paramyxovirus. I remember that paramyxovirus is a member of the herpesviruses family. These viruses are known for their ability to cause a wide range of respiratory infections, sometimes spreading quickly through respiratory droplets.

Looking at the options provided, I need to identify which one is a member of the paramyxovirus family and causes severe croup. The options are:

A: Meta pneumo virus
B: Measles
C: Ebola
D: Nipah virus
E: Newcastle disease virus
F: Mumps
G: Hendra
H: Parainfluenza
I: Rabies
J: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

Wait, hold on. Parainfluenza is another member of the paramyxovirus family. Yes, that's correct. Parainfluenza is sometimes referred to as the paramyxovirus family's member. Now, I need to think about whether parainfluenza is associated with very serious croup.

I recall that parainfluenza can cause a variety of respiratory conditions, including croup. But wait, is that the most severe? Or is there another virus that's more known for causing severe respiratory infections?

Looking at the options again, I also see that Measles (option B) is a separate member of herpesviruses. Measles is a severe virus that causes a very serious respiratory illness, often referred to as the "influenza" virus but technically a different family. Similarly, Mumps (F) is another member, but I think Mumps is more common in the tropical regions and not as severe as parainfluenza in the African context.

RSV (Option J) is the respiratory syncytial virus, which is a member of the herpesviruses. RSV can cause bronchitis, but it's not as severe as parainfluenza. Newcastle Disease Virus (E) is another member, but I don't think it's a problem for croup. Measles and Mumps are more commonly known for their severe respiratory impacts.

So, the options left that are in the paramyxovirus family are C (Ebola), D (Nipah), H (Parainfluenza), and I (Rabies). The question is which of these causes very serious croup.

Parainfluenza is known for causing respiratory infections, including croup, but it's also known as the Spanish influenza virus. I think RSV is more commonly associated with bronchitis, which is a less severe form. Measles and Mumps are more severe but not in the same family as the one causing the question.

So, between C, D, H, and J, the correct answer is H: Parainfluenza. Because paramyxovirus includes parainfluenza, and it's known for causing severe respiratory infections, including croup. Measles and Mumps are not in the same family, and RSV is a different family.

The correct answer is H: Parainfluenza. Parainfluenza is a member of the paramyxovirus family and is known for causing severe respiratory infections, including croup. Measles and Mumps are separate members of the herpesviruses family, and RSV is a different family altogether. 

Answer: H
