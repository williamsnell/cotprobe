Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the powers of the Congress. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which of the options is an example of an implied power of the Congress. The options are A through I, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that the Congress, which is the uppermost branch of the government, has various powers. The question is about implied powers, which are powers that aren't explicitly listed in the Constitution but are inferred or implied by the other powers.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Regulation of interstate commerce. I think this is a separate power, more like a state power. The U.S. Constitution doesn't explicitly mention this as a Congress power. So probably not A.

Option B: Power to create federal laws. Oh wait, that's a key point. The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to create and pass laws. So this is an implied power because the other powers don't cover it, and this amendment adds it. So B might be the answer.

Option C: Power to impeach the President. No, that's a branch-level power, more about the executive branch. Congress doesn't have that. So C isn't it.

Option D: Borrowing money on the credit of the United States. That sounds like a state power, specifically a credit agency. The Constitution doesn't list this as a Congress power. So D isn't correct.

Option E: Declarations of war. I think this is a branch-level power as well. The President has the final authority on declaring war. So E isn't a Congress power.

Option F: Power to impose an income tax. That's a federal power, specifically a state power. Imposing taxes is a branch-level function. So F isn't it.

Option G: Oversight of executive branch agencies. Hmm, the U.S. is a federal government, and Congress has the power to oversee agencies within it. So G is an implied power because Congress has the authority to review and supervise other branches. That makes G a possible answer.

Option H: Power to regulate immigration. That's a federal power as well, more like a state power. The Constitution doesn't list it as a Congress power, so H isn't it.

Option I: Power to approve presidential nominations. That's a branch-level power, specifically a state power. The President has the authority to approve nominations, so this isn't part of Congress's powers.

Wait, so B and G are possible. Let me think again. The question is about implied powers of the Congress. Implied powers that are not directly listed but come from the structure and other powers.

Regulation of interstate commerce and oversight of executive agencies are both powers Congress has. But which one is an example of an implied power?

Oh, wait! The power to regulate interstate commerce is a state power because it's about interstate commerce which is a state matter. The 13th Amendment gives Congress that power, making it implied.

On the other hand, the power to oversee executive agencies (G) is also implied because Congress has the authority to review other branches, not just do something it doesn't have the authority to do.

Wait, but the question is about which is an example of an implied power of the Congress. So both B and G are implied powers, but the question is which one is the correct answer.

Wait, let me reconsider. The power to regulate interstate commerce is a state power, but the power to create federal laws is an implied power because it's a branch power and the other powers don't cover it. So B is the correct answer.

Alternatively, option G is about the Oversight of the executive, which is a branch power, but the question is about Congress's powers. So G is a branch power, not a Congress power.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the specific powers.

The 13th Amendment gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is a state power, so B is correct.

The power to create federal laws is an implied power because Congress has the authority to do so, even though it's not listed as a direct power.

So B and G are both implied powers. Wait, no, the power to create federal laws is a separate power that doesn't directly come from Congress, but perhaps comes from state or other powers. Wait, no, the 13th Amendment explicitly gives Congress that power, making it an implied power.

The power to oversee executive agencies is part of the U.S.一支政府的权力，不是 Congress的权力。 So G is not an implied power of the Congress.

So the correct answer is B: Power to create federal laws.
</think>

The power to create federal laws (Option B) is an example of an implied power of the Congress. This is because the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce and create federal laws. This power is not directly listed in the Constitution but is inferred from the structure and other powers of Congress.

ANSWER: B
