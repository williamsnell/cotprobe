Okay, so I need to figure out how many states were in the Confederate States of America, also known as the Confederate States of America (CSA). I remember watching a movie about it or maybe reading a book a while back. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, so the options are from A to J. Let me think about what I know. I think the CSA was established after the American Civil War. It was formed by merging the North and South states, but I'm not sure how many states were originally in each side.

The North had 13 states (Alley, Blod, Calvert, Coakley, Delmar, Fort Benning, Fort Ticonderoga, Grant, Hamilton, James, K comfort, Kosciuszy, and Lee) and the South had 12 states (Albemarle, Allen, Bell, Calvert, Calhoun, Commerce, Cooper, Davis,Dispatch, Fort Bragg, Fortoper, and Scott). So if we merge them, that would make 13 + 12 = 25 states. But wait, I've heard that some states were excluded from the CSA. For example, two states were not part of the original 25. I think those were Alabama and Georgia. So that would subtract 2, leaving 23. But wait, I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with the original number.

Wait, another memory: the original number of states in the CSA was 25, but when considering the merging, the original 13 North and 12 South states would make 25, but some were excluded. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, I think the original number was 25, but when the states were merged, including those that were part of the original 13 and 12, but some were excluded. So maybe the total is 25 minus 2 equals 23. But looking at the options, 23 isn't one of them. The options are 10,11,12,13,14,16,18, etc. So perhaps I'm misremembering.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of states in the Union after the Civil War. Because the Union had 13 Northern states and 12 Southern states, making 25. But actually, the Union was the entire United States at that time, including territories. So when the Confederacy joined, they took some states. The original 25 would have included the 13 and 12. But I think that when the Confederacy joined, they took the states from the South, which were 12 (including Georgia and Alabama). Or maybe 12 original South states and 3 from the North? Wait, no, the North had 13, South had 12, so when the Union had 25, the Confederacy would have taken all but two, which would be the states that were part of the 13 North and 12 South. So that would be 25 - 2 =23, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the confusion is between the historical period. I think the question is about the historical period of the Confederacy, which was active in the late 1800s. So maybe the number of states in the CSA is 25, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of states in the CSA is 23, but that's not an option here.

Wait, looking at the options again: the choices are A:14, B:11, C:15, D:10, E:20, F:18, G:16, H:13, I:12, J:22. So 23 isn't an option. The closest is J:22. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, another angle. The original question might be referring to the number of states in the original 25, but perhaps during the Civil War, the number was different. No, the question is about the Confederacy, which was formed in 1863 after the Civil War, so the number of states would be the same as the original 25. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. I think the correct answer is 25, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of states remaining after the Confederacy took some, but I think that's not right because the Confederacy took the Southern states, so the number of remaining states is the ones from the North. Wait, no, the North had 13 and South 12. The Confederacy took the North's 13, but that can't be right because the North had more. Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of states in the Union, which was 13 North and 12 South, making 25. So the answer would be 25, but that's not an option here. The closest is J:22, but that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to think of another approach. I think the number of states in the Confederacy during their time was 25, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's 23, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of states in the Union, which was 13 North and 12 South, making 25. But none of the options is 25.

Wait, looking at the options again, J is 22. So perhaps 22 is the correct answer. But why? Because 25 minus 3 equals 22, but I'm not sure which 3 states were excluded. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of states in the original 25, but the correct answer isn't among the options. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the number of states in the Confederacy with the number in the Union. Wait, the original 25 were in the Union, and during the Civil War, the Confederacy took the South's 12 states. So the number of states in the Confederacy would be the 13 from the North. But that doesn't make sense, because the North had more, and the Confederacy would have taken the Southern states. So the number of states in the Confederacy would be 13 (but that's not one of the options). Alternatively, maybe it's the number of states that remained after the war, but that's not how it works.

Wait, another thought: the number of states in the Confederacy is 25, but perhaps the question is referring to the number of states in the original Union, which was 25, but that's not an option either. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the answer is H:13, which is the number of original Northern states. But that doesn't make sense because the Confederacy would have taken the Southern states. Alternatively, the correct answer is 25, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm recalling this wrong. Wait, I think the actual number of states in the Confederacy is 25, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is J:22, but I'm not sure why. Maybe the correct answer is 23, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe I should select the closest option, which is J:22. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: the number of states in the Union at the time was 13 (North) + 12 (South) = 25. The Confederacy took the South's 12 states, so the number of states remaining in the Union would be 13. But that's not what the question is asking; the question is about the number of states in the Confederacy, not the Union.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and need to pick J:22 as the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbers. Let's think differently. The original number of states in the Confederacy would be 25, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is J:22, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 23, but that's not an option. So I'm stuck between options J (22) and perhaps another.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the number. Let me think about the process of the Confederacy. The North had 13 states, the South had 12. The Confederacy took the South's 12 states, so the number of remaining North states would be 13. But the question isn't about the remaining states in the Union; it's about the number in the Confederacy. So the confusion is whether the question is about the number in the Union or in the Confederacy.

Wait, the question says, "How many states were in the Confederate States of America?" So that's the number in the Confederacy, which was 25 (13 North, 12 South), but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the original 25, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is 25, but that's not an option, so the closest is J:22.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is referring to the number of states in the original 25, but the correct number is actually 23, which would make the answer H:13, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of states in the original 25, but the answer isn't among the options. So in that case, perhaps the correct answer is J:22, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm remembering this wrong. Let me think. I think the correct answer is 25, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is J:22, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 23. But again, that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of states in the original 25, but the answer isn't given. So the closest is J:22.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct number of states in the Confederacy during their time was 25, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is 22, which is J. So I'll go with J:22.

The question asks how many states were in the Confederate States of America (CSA). The Union had 13 Northern states and 12 Southern states, totaling 25. However, the Confederacy took the Southern states, leaving 13 Northern states. Since the options provided do not include 25, the closest option is J:22.

Answer: J:22
