Okay, so I have this question about Fred Lowes' commission. Let me read it again. He sells typewriters and gets $15 for each one. If he sells 12, what's his commission? The options are A to J.

Hmm, right. So commission is the money he earns, and it's based on the number sold. Each typewriter is $15, and he sold 12. So I think I just need to multiply 15 by 12.

Wait, let me calculate that. 15 times 12. Let me think, 10 times 12 is 120, and 5 times 12 is 60. So adding those together, 120 plus 60 is 180. So his commission should be $180.

Looking at the options, option I says $180. So the answer must be I.

The commission is calculated by multiplying the number of typewriters sold by the commission per typewriter. 

**15 Ã— 12 = 180**

**Answer: I: $180**

The correct option is I.
