Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a researcher growing ferns and observing some phenotypes. The key points are about reproduction and the traits of these plants. She notices a new variant that stands out. When she tries to breed the original phenotype with the new one, no offspring are produced. But when she breeds the new variants, the offspring look like the new variant. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me break this down.

So, the original phenotype: she has some kind of fern. The new variant is a different one. When she tries to breed them—like crossbreeding—she gets no offspring. But if she crosses the new variants, the offspring look like the new variant. Hmm. 

Wait, so if she's crossing the original and the new, no offspring. But crossing the new with themselves gives similar look. Oh, this must be about reproductive isolation or hybridization. 

I remember that when two species produce offspring that look like either parent, they're called hybrid zones. This is a phenomenon where two species have isolated their own populations so that they can't interbreed. The offspring resemble one parent or the other. 

Ferns are a good example. Some species of ferns are native to different regions. For example, some are found in Europe and others in Asia. When you cross a European fern with an Asian one, you get hybrid plants that look like the European variety in parts and the Asian in others. But if you cross two European ones, you get plants that look more European. Similarly, cross two Asian ones, you get similar look.

So the researcher is growing a population of ferns, and she notices a new variant that stands out. When she tries to breed the original (maybe a different species) with the new, no offspring are produced. But when she crosses the new variety with itself, the offspring resemble the new.

Wait, but the question says the original phenotype is being used. So the scenario is that she's trying to breed two populations of the same species but different phenotypes. If she crosses them and no offspring result, that suggests that they can't interbreed. But if she crosses the new variants among themselves, the offspring are like the new.

Wait, no—let me rephrase. The researcher is growing a population of a certain type of fern. She notices a new variant that has a distinct phenotype. So maybe she's looking at two different species within the same genus or something. When she tries to breed the original (maybe another species) with the new variant, no offspring. But when she crosses the new variants together, they produce offspring that look like the new.

Wait, but if they can't interbreed, that's hybridization, but in this case, the offspring don't look like either parent when crossed. So maybe the new variant is a hybrid, but when crossed between themselves, they look like the new. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the question is about which plant exhibits this process. So it's about hybridization leading to hybrid zones where offspring resemble one or the other species.

Looking at the options, let's think about plants that have hybrid zones. Options include Dalmatians, but those are animals. Grass, orchids, fruit flies, etc. Let me think.

Dalmatians are animals. Grass is a plant. Fruit flies are insects. orchids are plants. Wheat is a grain plant.

Wait, the question is about plants. So options are C, D, E, F, H, I, J.

Wait, the question says the researcher is growing a population of "ferns" and notices a new variant. So maybe she's looking at two distinct plant species, or perhaps a population within a species.

So the question is about which plant species would exhibit this hybrid zone phenomenon. If she's trying to cross the original (maybe another species) with the new variant and no offspring, but the new with themselves produce similar phenotypes.

Wait, but in reality, when two species produce hybrid offspring, they look like one or the other. But in this case, the offspring don't resemble the parents. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the new variant is a hybrid, but when you cross the new with another of the same species, you get the new phenotype.

Wait, but the question says when she tries to breed the original with the new, no offspring. So that suggests that the original and new species are unable to interbreed. But when she crosses the new with itself, the offspring look like the new. So the new variety is a hybrid. But how can a hybrid have offspring that are the same as itself?

Wait, perhaps she's looking at two distinct plant species, and the new variant is a hybrid between them. But when you cross the original (maybe a different species) with the new, no offspring. But when you cross the new species with itself, the offspring resemble the new.

Alternatively, perhaps the new variant is a hybrid between the original and another species. No, the question says that when she tries to breed the original with the new, no offspring. So if the original is species A and the new is species B, then A and B cannot interbreed, but species B and B can (they produce offspring that look like B).

Wait, but the scenario in the question is that the researcher is growing a population of a certain variety. Let me think again.

The researcher notices a new variant. So perhaps she's looking at the original and the new as different species. When she cross them, no offspring. But when she crosses the new with the new, they produce the new's look.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the new is a hybrid between the original and another, then cross original with new would produce a hybrid that's similar to the original. But the question says that when she tries to breed the original with the new, no offspring. So that suggests that the original and new can't interbreed. But when she crosses the new with itself, they produce similar look.

Wait, perhaps the new is a hybrid of two different species. So the original is species X, new is a hybrid between X and Y. Then, when you cross X (original) with the hybrid (new), no offspring. But when you cross the hybrid (new) with itself, the offspring look like the new.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the hybrid is between X and Y, then X and Y can't interbreed. So when you cross X and Y, you get the hybrid. But when you cross the hybrid with itself, it can produce offspring that look like the hybrid, which is a mix of X and Y. But the question says that when she crosses the new variants, the offspring look like the new variant. So perhaps the new variant is the hybrid.

Wait, but then when she crosses the original (X) with the new (Y hybrid), the offspring don't look like either. But that contradicts the scenario because the original and new can't interbreed, so they shouldn't produce any offspring. But in the question, when she crosses the original with the new, she gets no offspring. But when she crosses the new with the new, she gets offspring that resemble the new.

Wait, but in reality, when two species produce hybrid offspring, their offspring resemble one or the other. So if the new is a hybrid between X and Y, then X and Y cannot interbreed. But when you cross the new (which is a hybrid) with itself, you get offspring that are similar to the hybrid. But the question says that the offspring look like the new. So perhaps in this case, the new is a hybrid, and when you cross the new with an original, you get something that doesn't look like either? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the new variant is a hybrid, but when you cross the new with itself, you get the new's phenotype. So the new is a hybrid between two species, and when you cross it with itself, you get similar look. But the original and the new can't interbreed. Wait, no, the original and new can't interbreed, so no offspring. But the new can interbreed with itself, so the offspring look like the new.

Wait, but in reality, for two different species, the hybrid can't interbreed, but the hybrid of a species with itself can. So in the scenario, the researcher has a population with two different phenotypes, like two species, which can't interbreed, but when you cross the new with itself, you get the new's phenotype.

So the question is asking which plant exhibits this. So the correct answer is a plant that can't interbreed with another species, but can interbreed with itself. So the answer would be a hybrid that can't interbreed with another species but can interbreed with itself.

Looking at the options, let's see which plants fit that.

The options are:

A: Goldfish (fish, so not relevant)
B: Spotted toads (toads are frogs, perhaps. Spotted toads are an extinct species, so maybe not relevant)
C: Dalmatians (animals)
D: Grass
E: Orchids (flowers)
F: Wheat (corn, plant)
G: Garden snails (snails)
H: Fruit flies (insect)
I: Fallow deer (maybe a rodent)
J: House cats (mammal)

Wait, the question is about a plant.

So options D, E, F, H, I, J.

But wait, the question is about a population of a single type of plant, so the species is a plant.

So the correct answer must be a plant that can't interbreed with another species but can interbreed with itself.

So which plants are like that?

Well, an example is the hybrid of wild and cultivated plants. For example, wild roses and cultivated daisy. The wild roses and daisies can't interbreed, but the hybrid of wild and cultivated can't interbreed with wild or cultivated, but when you cross wild and cultivated, you get the hybrid. But in this scenario, the researcher is using two different phenotypes.

Wait, but the question says when she tries to breed the original with the new, no offspring. So that suggests that the original is one species, the new is another. They can't interbreed, so no offspring. But when she crosses the new with itself, the offspring look like the new.

Wait, but that would be the case if the new is a hybrid of the original and another species. So the original is X, the new is a hybrid between X and Y. Then, when you cross X and new, no offspring. But when you cross new with new, they produce offspring that look like the new.

So, in the question, the researcher is crossing the original (X) with the new (Y hybrid), no offspring. But when she crosses the new (Y hybrid) with itself, the offspring look like Y.

So which plants are like this?

Dalmatians (animals), I think. Dalmatians are found in Europe and Asia. They're hybrid plants between wild and wild-type species. When you cross a European dalmatian with an Asian dalmatian, you get hybrid plants that look like European or Asian. But when you cross two European dalmatians, you get plants that look more European. Similarly, crossing two Asian dalmatians would give Asian.

So in this case, when you breed the original (say, European) with the new (Asian), you get hybrid plants that look like both. But if the researcher is using two different plant species (like two different dalmatian varieties), then crossing them would produce hybrid offspring that look like either, but not both. Wait, but the question says that when she crosses the original with the new, no offspring are produced. Hmm. Or maybe the scenario is that she's trying to breed two populations of the same species but different phenotypes. Wait, but the question says she's growing a population of a single species, but the new variant is another phenotype.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the new variant is a hybrid that can't interbreed with the original, but can interbreed with itself.

In that case, the answer is likely a hybrid, such as dalmatians or garden snails or orchids. But looking at the options, the question is about plants.

Wait, the options are:

D: Grass

E: Orchids

F: Wheat

H: Fruit flies

I: Fallow deer

Wait, but orchids and garden snails are plants. Fruit flies are insects.

So, the correct answer is likely a plant. So options D, E, F, H, I, J. But wait, the initial options listed J as house cats, which are mammals. So probably the answer is a plant.

So from the options, the plants that can't interbreed with another species but can interbreed with themselves are the dalmatians (animals) and garden snails (animals), but the question is about a plant. So perhaps the answer is D: Grass?

Wait, no. Grass is a single species. So if she has two grass varieties that can't interbreed, then when she crosses them, no offspring. But when she crosses a grass variety with another of the same species, she gets grass plants that look like the other. But in that case, the new variety would be a hybrid. The question is about which plant exhibits the process, so it's a plant that can't interbreed with another species but can interbreed with itself.

Wait, so the correct example is a hybrid that can't interbreed with another species but can interbreed with itself. So the answer is a hybrid that can't interbreed with another species but can interbreed with itself.

So which of the options are hybrid plants that can't interbreed with another species?

Dalmatians (animals), but they're not plants. So perhaps the answer is not among the options given. But wait, the options include F: Wheat (a plant), H: Fruit flies (insect), which are different.

Wait, but the question is about a plant. So from the options, the answer is probably F: Wheat, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another example is an army ant (hexapod), but that's a taxon, not a plant.

Wait, the question is about plants, so let's look for plants that can't interbreed with another species but can interbreed with themselves. For example, wild and cultivated plants can't interbreed, but their hybrids can't interbreed with wild or cultivated. So if a population has two different plant species (like wild and cultivated), then the hybrid can't interbreed with either. But if you cross two wild plants, they can interbreed, and the offspring are wild. Similarly, two cultivated plants can interbreed, but their offspring are cultivated. But the hybrid can't interbreed with either.

Wait, no, the question says that when she crosses the original (say, wild) with the new (cultivated), no offspring. But when she crosses the new with itself, the offspring look like the new.

Wait, that's the case for the hybrid between wild and cultivated plants. So in that example, the researcher has wild and cultivated plants as the original and new. When she crosses wild and cultivated, no offspring. Wait no, that can't happen because wild and cultivated can interbreed.

Wait, perhaps the original and new are two different species, and when you cross them, no offspring. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about hybrid zones in a single species. For example, if you have two different phenotypes in the same species, like two different varieties of a plant, then when you cross the original variety with the new, no offspring. But when you cross the new variety with itself, the offspring resemble the new.

Wait, but that's not possible because the new is a hybrid. So perhaps the question is referring to a phenomenon where a population of a single species has two distinct phenotypes that can't interbreed. But that's not realistic because that would require the two phenotypes to be incompatible. However, in reality, when two species produce hybrid offspring, the hybrid can't interbreed with either parent. But when you cross a hybrid with itself, you can get the hybrid again.

Wait, but the question states that when she crosses the original with the new, no offspring. So that suggests that the original and new can't interbreed. But in reality, the original and new (hybrid) can't interbreed.

Wait, perhaps the original and new are both species of the same plant, but different varieties. So when you cross them, no offspring. But when you cross one with itself, you get the same variety.

Wait, but that's not possible because if they are the same species, you should be able to interbreed. But if they are different species (like two different varieties of the same plant), then they can't interbreed.

Wait, the question says she notices a new variant (so the original is another species, and the new is the hybrid). So when she crosses the original with the new, no offspring. But when she crosses the new with itself, the offspring look like the new.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If the new is a hybrid between original and another species, then the original and new can't interbreed. But when you cross the new with itself (hybrid), you can get the same phenotype. 

But the question says that when she crosses the original with the new, no offspring. So perhaps the original and new are two different species, and when you cross them, no offspring. But when you cross the new with the original, you get the hybrid which doesn't look like either. But that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the scenario is that the researcher is crossing two different populations of the same species but different phenotypes. So she has two populations: X and Y. When she crosses X with Y, no offspring. Because they can't interbreed. But when she crosses Y with Y, the offspring are Y, which are similar to the new. Wait, but the new is the hybrid. So perhaps when she crosses Y (new) with Y (same as new), she gets Y, which is the new's phenotype.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is likely a hybrid that can't interbreed with the original but can interbreed with itself. The only plant in the options that fits this is F: Wheat. Wait, but wheat is a plant. So when you cross two wheat plants, the offspring are still wheat. So if she's crossing the original (another species) with wheat, no offspring. But if she's crossing wheat with wheat, the offspring are wheat, which are the same as the original (if the original is not wheat). Wait no, the original and new can't interbreed, but the new can interbreed with itself.

Wait, perhaps the original is a different plant, and the new is a hybrid of two plants. So the researcher has a population that includes two different plants. For example, species A and species B. When she crosses A with B, no offspring. But when she crosses B with B, the offspring are B, which is the new. But the original and new can't interbreed.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if B is a hybrid, then B can interbreed with itself. So the researcher's population has two species that can't interbreed, but when she crosses one with itself, the offspring are the same.

Wait, no, the researcher is treating a population of a single species as having two different phenotypes. So she's crossing the original (another species) with the new, getting no offspring, implying they can't interbreed. But when she crosses the new with itself, she gets the new's phenotype.

Wait, that would occur if the new is a hybrid of two species. So when you cross the new with the original, no offspring because they can't interbreed. But when you cross the new with itself, the offspring are the same as the new, which is a hybrid. But the question says that the offspring look like the new. So perhaps the new is a hybrid between two species, but when you cross the new with itself, the offspring are similar to the new.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the question again. It's about a hybrid zone where two species can't interbreed, but when you cross the hybrid with itself, the offspring look like the hybrid, which is a mix of the two parents. But in the scenario given, the researcher is trying to breed the original with the new, and no offspring are produced. So the original and new can't interbreed, but when you cross the new with itself, the offspring look like the new. But that's not possible because the new is a hybrid.

Wait, perhaps the researcher is using two different plant populations, such as wild and cultivated, which can't interbreed. So when she crosses wild with cultivated, no offspring. But when she crosses cultivated with cultivated, the offspring are cultivated, which is the same as the new. So perhaps the new is the cultivated plant, and when you cross cultivated with cultivated, the offspring are cultivated, which is the same as the new. But the original was wild. So the new variant is the cultivated one. So when she crosses wild (original) with cultivated (new), no offspring. But when she crosses cultivated (new) with cultivated (new), the offspring are cultivated, which is the new. But the question says that the offspring look like the new. So it fits.

So the researcher is using a population of wild and cultivated plants. When she crosses wild (original) with cultivated (new), no offspring. But when she crosses cultivated (new) with cultivated (new), the offspring resemble cultivated, which is the new. So the new is the hybrid between wild and cultivated.

In that case, the answer is the hybrid that can't interbreed with wild or cultivated, but can interbreed with itself. So the question is about which plant exhibits this process. The answer is a hybrid of wild and cultivated plants. But looking at the options, none of them are animals. So perhaps the question is about a hybrid of two different plant species, but the options don't include that.

Wait, the options are:

D: Grass

E: Orchids

F: Wheat

H: Fruit flies

I: Fallow deer

J: House cats

So the options are plants. So perhaps the correct answer is F: Wheat, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another example is the hybrid of wild and cultivated plants. So if the researcher has a population of wild plants and cultivated plants, then the hybrid can't interbreed with either. So when she crosses wild and cultivated, the offspring don't resemble either. But when she crosses the hybrid with the hybrid, the offspring are the hybrid. But the question says when she crosses the original with the new, no offspring. So perhaps the original is wild, the new is cultivated. So when she crosses wild and cultivated, no offspring. But when she crosses cultivated (new) with cultivated (new), the offspring are cultivated, which is the same as the new. So it fits.

So in that case, the answer is the hybrid of wild and cultivated plants. But the options don't include any animals. So perhaps the question is about a hybrid that can't interbreed with the original, but can interbreed with itself. So the correct answer would be a plant that exhibits this phenomenon.

Looking at the options, F: Wheat is a plant. So perhaps the answer is F: Wheat.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another example is the hybrid of wild and cultivated plants, but since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct answer is F: Wheat, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question is about which plant exhibits the process. The process is when two species can't interbreed, but their hybrids can interbreed with themselves. So the answer is a hybrid that can't interbreed with the original but can interbreed with the original. So the correct answer is a hybrid of two plant species.

In that case, the correct answer is F: Wheat, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is D: Grass, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another example is the hybrid of wild and cultivated plants. So the answer is a hybrid, which is not one of the options, but the question asks about the plant.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: Wheat, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the correct answer is E: Orchids, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options.

The options are:

D: Grass

E: Orchids

F: Wheat

H: Fruit flies

I: Fallow deer

J: House cats

So the correct answer is likely F: Wheat.

Wait, no. Another example is the hybrid of wild and cultivated plants, which can't interbreed but can interbreed with themselves. So the answer would be a hybrid of two plant species, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is about a hybrid of two plant species, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F: Wheat because wheat is a common plant, and it's a hybrid that can't interbreed with wild plants but can interbreed with itself. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the correct answer is F: Wheat. Because when you cross wild plants with cultivated plants, no offspring result. But when you cross cultivated plants with themselves, you get cultivated plants, which are the same as the new.

Wait, but in reality, when you cross two different plant species, their hybrids can't interbreed with either parent. So when she has wild and cultivated plants, the hybrids can't interbreed with wild or cultivated plants. But when she crosses the hybrid with itself, the offspring are the hybrid again.

So in that case, the answer is the hybrid, which is not among the options. But the question is about which plant exhibits this process. So perhaps the correct answer is D: Grass. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E: Orchids. No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F: Wheat. So I'll go with F: Wheat.
</think>

The correct answer is **F: Wheat**. 

In the context of hybrid zones, when two plant species cannot interbreed, their hybrids cannot interbreed with either parent species. However, when the hybrid is crossed with itself, it can produce offspring that resemble itself. This phenomenon is exemplified by wheat, where the hybrid cannot interbreed with wild or cultivated plants but can interbreed with itself, producing offspring resembling the hybrid. 

ANSWER: F
