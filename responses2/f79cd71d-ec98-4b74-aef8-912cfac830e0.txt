Question:

TencerInc. has estimated its revenue function to be r(x) = 3x^2, where x is the number of years the company has been in business and r(x) is the total revenue earned up to year x in millions. The profit function is f(x) = 2x^2 - 5x +1, f(x) is the total profit earned up to year x. What is the cost accrued over a three year period? What is the rate of change of cost of production by the end of the third year?

Options:

A: $25 million, $12 million
B: $23 million, $11 million
C: $27 million, $13 million
D: $19 million, $10 million
E: $24 million, $13 million
F: $21 million, $9 million
G: $26 million, $14 million
H: $20 million, $10 million
I: $22 million, $11 million
J: $22 million, $12 million

Okay, so I've got this problem here about TencerInc.'s revenue and profit functions. The question is asking for the cost accrued over a three-year period and the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year. Hmm, I remember that profit is calculated as revenue minus cost. So, profit function f(x) is equal to revenue r(x) minus cost c(x). 

Wait, right. So, f(x) = r(x) - c(x). So, if I rearrange that, then c(x) must be r(x) minus f(x). That makes sense.

The problem gives me r(x) as 3x², and f(x) as 2x² -5x +1. Oh, and x is the number of years. Since we're looking at the three-year period, I think x would be 3 because at the end of the third year, that's when we're considering the cost up to those three years.

So first, I need to find the cost function c(x). Let's plug in x=3 into both r(x) and f(x).

Calculating r(3): 3*(3)² = 3*9 = 27 million. So, revenue after 3 years is 27 million.

Calculating f(3): 2*(3)^2 -5*(3) +1. Let's compute each term: 2*9 is 18, 5*3 is 15, so 18-15 is 3, plus 1 is 4. So f(3) is 4 million.

So, c(3) = r(3) - f(3) = 27 -4 = 23 million. So, the cost accrued over three years is 23 million dollars. That's the first part of the answer.

Now, the second part is the rate of change of cost by the end of the third year. Rate of change, I think that refers to the derivative of the cost function at x=3. Because the derivative gives the instantaneous rate of change, which in this case would be the marginal cost at that point.

So, first, I need to find the derivative of c(x). Since c(x) = r(x) - f(x), the derivative c’(x) would be the derivative of r(x) minus the derivative of f(x).

Given that r(x) = 3x², the derivative dr/dx is 6x.

f(x) is 2x² -5x +1, so df/dx is 4x -5.

Thus, c’(x) = 6x - (4x -5) = 6x -4x +5 = 2x +5.

Now, evaluating at x=3: 2*3 +5 = 6 +5 =11 million dollars per year. So, the rate of change of cost at the end of the third year is $11 million.

Putting it together, the cost over three years is 23 million, and the rate of change is 11 million. Looking at the options, option B is 23 million and 11 million. So, the correct answer should be option B.

The cost function is derived by subtracting the profit function from the revenue function: c(x) = r(x) - f(x). At x = 3, r(3) = 27 million and f(3) = 4 million, so c(3) = 23 million. The derivative of the cost function, c’(x) = 2x +5, evaluated at x=3 gives 11 million. Thus, the cost over three years is 23 million, and the rate is 11 million, which corresponds to option B.
