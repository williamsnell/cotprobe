Okay, so I have this Python question in front of me. The question is asking what the output of the statement "a" + "ab" is in Python 3. The options are labeled from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this step by step.

Hmm, right, in Python, when you use the + operator with strings, it concatenates them. Like, if I have 'x' + 'y', it gives me 'xy'. So the example here is "a" + "ab". So each string is a single character, and "ab" is two characters. So adding them together should give "aab".

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. So "a" is a string of length 1, and "ab" is length 2. When you add them, the result should be "aab"—so three characters in total. Looking at the options, option D is "aab", which fits that. Let me check the options again.

Option A: aaab. That's four 'a's. No, that's not right because each string is separate. So adding them would mean the 'a' from the first string and the 'a' from the second. So the combined string would have 'a' + 'a' from the two strings. So the first 'a' is from the first string, the next 'a' comes from the second string. Then the 'b' comes from the second string. So total of 'a' + 'a' + 'b' = 'aab', which is option D.

Other options: Option B is 'aab'—wait, option B is written as 'aab', but that's the same as 'aab'. So option D is the correct one. Option H is 'a+ab'? No, that's not a string, that's a Python expression but not evaluated. So probably not the answer. Option E is 'ab', which is just the second string, but that's not right because the first string's 'a' is also part of the result.

Wait, another thought: in Python, the strings are concatenated without any issues. So "a" + "ab" should produce "aab". So the correct output is option D: "aab". 

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: aaab
B: aab
C: "a" + "ab" 
D: aba
E: ab
F: abab
G: a ab
H: a+ab
I: Error
J: a aab

So option C is the string itself, not the result. So the correct answer is D.

The correct output of the statement "a" + "ab" in Python 3 is "aab". 

Answer: D
