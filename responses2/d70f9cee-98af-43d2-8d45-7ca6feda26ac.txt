Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cache memory, specifically a 3-way, set-associative cache. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking what's true about such a cache. The options are A through G, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's break down each option.

First, what's a 3-way set-associative cache? I remember that in set-associative caches, the cache lines are organized into a hierarchy, determined by a set tag. The set tag is made up of bits that determine which set the cache line belongs to. For a 3-way set-associative, each set can have up to 3 lines, I think. 

So for a 3-way, set-associative, each tag (or set) can have 3 lines. The main memory is divided into these sets, and each main memory word is stored at one of these lines. 

Now, looking at the options:

Option D: possible only with write-back. Hmm, no, I think write-back is a different concept. Write-back is when the cache is replaced when a block is written, whereas write-through replaces when a block is read. So D might not be correct.

Option F: one in which each cache can store 3 main memory words. Wait, each cache line can hold multiple words, not just one. So F seems incorrect because each line can hold more than one word.

Option C: each main memory word can be stored at any of 4 cache locations. No, wait, that's 4, but a 3-way set-associative would have 3 possible lines per tag. So 4 isn't matching.

Option E: effective only if 3 or fewer processes are running. Wait, I'm not sure about this. The number of processes running alternately on the CPU might affect how the cache is used, but I don't recall the exact reasoning. Maybe it depends on cache line size and associativity.

Option B: possible only with write-through. No, write-through is when the cache is replaced when a block is read, not when written. So B seems incorrect.

Option G: each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations. Oh, wait! That makes sense. Because in a 3-way set-associative, each tag (set) can have 3 lines. So when a main memory word is loaded, it goes into one of those 3 lines. So each memory word is stored at any of the 3 cache locations. So G sounds correct.

Option A: only effective when more than 3 processes are running. Hmm, I'm not sure. The number of processes running could affect cache usage, but I don't think that's a strict requirement for a 3-way set-associative. Maybe if it's a 4-way, because each set would have 4 lines, but for 3-way, it can handle up to 3 processes. Or maybe the number of processes affects how often the cache needs to be refilled. But I'm not certain about this option.

Option C: each main memory word can be stored at any of 4 cache locations. No, because it's 3-way, so 3.

Option D: possible only with write-back. No, that's not right.

So the correct answer seems to be G because each main memory word is stored at any of 3 cache locations.
</think>

The correct answer is G: "one in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations."

**Explanation:**
In a 3-way set-associative cache, the main memory words are stored across multiple cache lines, determined by a set tag. Each set can hold up to 3 lines. Therefore, each main memory word can be stored in any of the 3 cache lines available in a 3-way set-associative configuration. This aligns with option G. 

Other options are incorrect because they either describe scenarios not applicable to 3-way set-associative caches or misstate the characteristics of the cache. 

Answer: G
