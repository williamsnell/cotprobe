Question:

A college student owns an expensive sports car. His friend called him up one afternoon and asked to borrow his car for a date he had that night. The college student generously lent the car to his friend. On his way home from the date, basking in the memories of a beautiful evening, the friend lost control of the car and hit a pedestrian. As a result of the accident, and after learning that the friend had no money and no insurance, the pedestrian brought suit against the college student to recover for his injuries. He asserted a claim against the college student for negligent entrustment of a vehicle. During his case, the pedestrian introduced evidence that the friend had been in several previous accidents. In his defense, the college student offered the testimony of his girlfriend that the college student frequently lent his car to his friend. The girlfriend further testified that the college student gave his friend permission to use his car only after determining that the friend was a careful and attentive driver. The girlfriend's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as evidence of the friend's driving skill.
B: inadmissible, because it's irrelevant to the case.
C: admissible as a present sense impression.
D: inadmissible, because it's hearsay.
E: inadmissible, because it's opinion testimony.
F: admissible as a past recollection recorded.
G: admissible as character evidence.
H: admissible as evidence of habit.
I: inadmissible, because she is biased.
J: inadmissible, because it goes to the college student's character.

Alright, so I've got this legal question in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The scenario is about a college student who lent his car to a friend for a date night. The friend lost control of the car, hit a pedestrian, and the pedestrian suing the student for negligent entrustment. 

The key here is understanding what kind of evidence the student presented. The student had a witness testimony from his girlfriend that the college student frequently lent the car to his friend. The girlfriend explained that the college student gave permission only after ensuring the friend was careful and attentive.

So, the question is about whether this testimony is admissible. I remember that evidence of a person's past conduct is usually hearsay. But wait, there are exceptions. One exception is when the conduct was a previous accident, and the defendant had a prior relationship with the same person. Or maybe it's a previous accident and the defendant had a prior relationship.

Wait, in this case, the college student lent the car to his friend, and the friend was in several previous accidents. So the friend was involved in a previous accident. The college student's girlfriend testified that the college student gave permission only after the friend was a careful and attentive driver. So maybe the friend was in an accident before, and the student ensured the friend could use the car because the friend was careful.

Hold on, I think this falls under a hearsay exception. The exception for previous conduct in negligence cases? Or perhaps the previous accident exception. Alternatively, it might be about a claim for negligent entrustment, which is a defense. But in this case, the evidence is about how the student lent the car, so perhaps the previous accident exception applies.

Wait, the previous accident exception allows you to use an accident that was a previous accident as evidence of the defendant's behavior. But in this case, the student is the defendant, and the friend is the plaintiff. The student's statement about giving permission only after the friend was careful might relate to the defendant's conduct toward the plaintiff.

Wait, no, the friend is the one who was in several previous accidents. The student is lending the car, which is a previous accident. So the student's statement about the friend being attentive might be an exception to the previous accident rule. Or perhaps it's about the defendant's actions towards the plaintiff.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The previous accident exception applies when the defendant made the statement in the context of a previous accident that was a relevant event. So if the defendant lent the car because the friend had a previous accident, perhaps. Wait, but the friend was in several previous accidents, and the student lent the car which was part of those. So the friend's previous accident could serve as a basis for the student's statement.

Alternatively, maybe the student's statement about the friend's previous accident is hearsay. But if the friend was a previous party, then he could have a claim against the student for negligence. But in this case, the student is lending the car, so perhaps it's about the defendant's conduct toward the plaintiff.

Wait, the friend was in several previous accidents. The student lent the car to the friend because the friend was a careful driver. So maybe the friend's conduct in those previous accidents was the issue. But the defendant's statement about the friend's conduct when lending the car may relate to the defendant's prior conduct.

Hmm. Alternatively, the scenario might involve the previous accident exception. The defendant (student) lent the car to the friend because the friend was in a previous accident. So the previous accident is a relevant event, and the defendant's statement about the friend's conduct (like being attentive) could be used as evidence, perhaps as a defense.

Wait, but the defendant is the one lending the car, and the plaintiff is the friend. So maybe the previous accident exception doesn't apply because that's about the defendant's conduct towards the plaintiff. Alternatively, the defense could be that the student's statement is a previous conduct statement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the previous accident exception applies to the defendant's actions towards a third party because of a prior accident that was relevant to the defendant's conduct. So if the defendant lent the car because of a previous accident, and that accident was a relevant event, then the defendant's statement about the friend's conduct would be admissible as a defense. But in this case, the statement is not about the defendant's conduct towards the plaintiff but about the defendant's action of lending the car.

Wait, the friend was in several previous accidents. The student gave permission to use his car only after the friend was a careful driver. So the friend's conduct in those previous accidents was relevant. So perhaps the student's statement about the friend's conduct when lending the car could be used as evidence of the defendant's conduct towards the plaintiff, which is the friend.

So the previous accident exception allows you to use the events of a previous accident as evidence of the defendant's conduct towards a third party. So if the defendant lent the car to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was involved in a prior accident, the defendant can use that prior accident as evidence of the behavior towards the plaintiff.

But in this case, the defendant is lending the car to the friend, and the friend was in several previous accidents. So the friend's conduct in those previous accidents is a previous accident, and the defendant lent the car to him because of that. So the defendant is using the friend's conduct in a previous accident as evidence of his conduct towards the friend.

But wait, the friend was the plaintiff here. So the defense would be that the defendant's statements about the friend's conduct towards the student's car (when the car was lent) are based on the friend's conduct in a previous accident. So the previous accident exception applies, and the defendant's statement is admissible.

Alternatively, the previous accident exception applies when the defendant's statement was made in the context of a previous accident that was a relevant event for the defendant's conduct towards the plaintiff. If the student lent the car to the friend because of the friend's previous accident, then the student's statement about the friend's conduct is an admission to a previous accident, making it admissible as a defense.

Wait, the previous accident exception allows using the facts of a previous accident as evidence of the defendant's conduct towards a third party. So if the defendant lent the car to the friend because the friend was in a previous accident, the student's statement about the friend's conduct (like being careful) is admissible as a defense.

So the defendant's statement would be an admission to a previous accident, and that's allowed as evidence. So the friend's statement is a defense because the student's statement is admissible.

But wait, the question is about the friend's testimony. The friend's testimony was about the student's actions. So the friend would not be necessarily admissible. The question is about the evidence presented by the pedestrian. The pedestrian introduced the friend's testimony, but the friend's own statement is about the student's actions, which is an admission.

Wait, but the question is whether the evidence that the friend gave is inadmissible. The friend's testimony is about the student's actions, but the question is about the evidence presented. So the friend's statement is an admission to a previous accident and would be admissible if the previous accident exception applies.

Wait, but the previous accident exception requires that the previous accident was a relevant event. In this case, the friend was in several previous accidents. The scenario says that the friend hit a pedestrian after losing control of the car, and the friend lost control because the car was in a previous accident. So the previous accident is relevant.

Therefore, the previous accident exception applies. So the student's statement that the friend was a careful driver when lending the car would be admissible as a defense, but in this case, the friend's statement is about the student's actions, not the student's conduct. So the friend's testimony is about the student's actions, but the question is about the evidence presented by the friend.

Wait, but the question is about the evidence presented by the pedestrian. So the pedestrian introduced the friend's testimony, which is about the student's actions. The defense is the friend's statement. So the friend's testimony is not evidence that the student was negligent, but rather the student's actions.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

The defense offered the friend's testimony that the student gave permission to use his car only after the friend was a careful and attentive driver. That testimony is about the student's actions towards the friend, not about the student's conduct towards the friend.

So the friend's statement is about the student's conduct (to use the car), not about the student's conduct towards the friend. Therefore, the friend's statement is not evidence of the student's conduct, but rather evidence of the student's conduct in a previous accident.

Wait, but the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. The friend's testimony is about the student's conduct, not the student's conduct towards the friend. So the friend's statement is an admission, which is allowed by the previous accident exception.

Wait, but the defense is the friend's statement, which is about the student's conduct. So the friend's statement is about the student's conduct, not about the student's conduct towards the friend. So in that case, the friend's statement is not evidence that the student was negligent, but rather that the student had a previous accident that was relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the elements of the negligence claim. The defendant (student) lent the car to the friend, and the friend was in several previous accidents. The student gave permission only after the friend was careful. So the student's conduct of lending the car to the friend was based on the friend's ability to drive, which was a factor in the previous accident.

So the previous accident exception applies, and the student's statement about the friend's conduct (being careful) is an admission to a previous accident. Therefore, that statement is admissible as evidence. So the friend's statement, which is about the student's conduct, is not evidence of negligence but rather the student's conduct. So the friend's testimony is not evidence of negligence but rather a defense.

Wait, but in the question, the pedestrian is suing for negligent entrustment. So the evidence presented by the friend is about the student's conduct, not the student's conduct towards the friend. So the friend's testimony is not evidence of negligence against the student, but rather against the student's conduct towards the friend.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. The question is about the friend's statement, which is about the student's actions, not about the student's conduct. So the friend's statement is about the student's conduct, so it's not evidence of negligence against the student. Therefore, the friend's statement is not evidence of negligence, so the evidence is not admissible.

Wait, but the question is about the evidence presented by the pedestrian. The pedestrian introduced the friend's testimony. So the friend's testimony is about the student's conduct, not about the student's conduct towards the friend. So the friend's statement is about the student's actions, not the student's conduct. Thus, the friend's statement is not evidence that the student was negligent. Therefore, the evidence is not admissible.

Wait, but I'm getting the opposite. Let me try to clarify.

The defense is that the friend was a careful driver, allowing the student to use the car. So the student's statement about the friend's conduct is evidence that the student was negligent. But the friend's statement is about the student's actions. So the friend's statement is about the student's conduct, which is the defendant's conduct towards the plaintiff. So the friend's statement is not evidence of negligence against the student; it's about the student's conduct towards the friend.

Wait, but in this case, the friend was in a previous accident, so the student's statement that the friend was careful is an admission to a previous accident. Therefore, that statement is admissible as evidence. So the friend's statement is not evidence of negligence against the student.

Wait, but the question is about the evidence presented by the pedestrian. The pedestrian introduced the friend's testimony, which is about the student's conduct. The defense is that the student lent the car to the friend, and the friend was careful, allowing the student to use the car. So the defense is using the friend's conduct (being careful) to show that the student was negligent in lending the car. But the friend's statement is not evidence against the student; it's about the student's actions. So the friend's statement is not evidence against the student, but rather against the student's conduct towards the friend.

Therefore, the evidence presented by the friend is about the student's actions, not about the student's conduct. So the friend's statement is not evidence of negligence against the student. Therefore, the evidence is not admissible.

Wait, but the question is whether the evidence is admissible. The pedestrian introduced the friend's testimony, which is about the student's actions. The defense is that the student's statement about the friend's conduct is admissible as evidence of negligence. But the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. The friend's statement is about the student's actions, so the friend's testimony is not evidence of negligence. Therefore, the evidence is not admissible.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the friend's testimony is about the student's conduct, so it's not evidence of negligence against the student. Therefore, the evidence is not admissible. So the answer would be B: inadmissible, because it's irrelevant to the case.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The defense is that the friend, after being in a previous accident, was a careful driver, allowing the student to use the car. So the student's statement about the friend's conduct (being careful) is evidence of negligence. So the friend's statement is not evidence of negligence, but that the student lent the car to the friend because the friend was careful. But the friend's statement is not against the student but against the student's conduct towards the friend.

Wait, no, the friend's statement is about the student's actions. So the friend's statement is not evidence against the student. Therefore, the evidence introduced by the pedestrian is not admissible, making the evidence inadmissible. So the correct answer would be B: inadmissible, because it's irrelevant to the case.

Wait, but the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. The pedestrian introduced the friend's testimony. The defense is the student's statement about the friend's conduct. So the friend's statement is not evidence of negligence against the student; it's about the student's conduct. So the friend's statement is not evidence against the student, making it inadmissible. Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible, so the answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the friend's statement is admissible as an admission. But that's about the student's actions, not the student's conduct. So the friend's statement is not evidence against the student. Therefore, the evidence is not admissible. So the answer would be B.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the friend's testimony regarding the student's conduct. The pedestrian introduced the friend's testimony that the student gave permission to use the car only after the friend was a careful and attentive driver. The defense, on the other hand, argues that this testimony is admissible as evidence of the student's conduct towards the friend, thereby establishing negligence.

The analysis hinges on the principles of evidence, particularly the previous accident exception and the previous conduct exception. The previous accident exception allows evidence of a previous accident to be used as evidence of the defendant's conduct towards a third party. In this case, the friend was in several previous accidents, and the student lent the car to the friend, which could be viewed as an admission to a previous accident. This exception applies when the defendant's statement is made in the context of a previous accident that was a relevant event for the defendant's conduct towards a third party.

The friend's testimony is about the student's actions, not the student's conduct towards the friend. Therefore, the friend's statement is not evidence of negligence against the student but rather an admission to a previous accident. Since the previous accident exception applies, the friend's statement is admissible as evidence of the student's conduct towards the friend.

However, the pedestrian's introduction of the friend's testimony is irrelevant to proving negligence against the student. The evidence introduced by the pedestrian is not admissible because it does not address the issue of negligence. Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible, and the correct answer is:

ANSWER: B
