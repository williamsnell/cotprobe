Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read it again. The question is about a sister and brother owning a ranch as joint tenants. If the sister transfers her interest by a quitclaim deed to her friend without the brother's knowledge, what interest does the friend have?

Hmm, I remember that joint tenants have some specific rights. They're supposed to divide the property equally unless there's a joint tenancy. Wait, but wait—this is a joint tenancy, right? So if the sister and brother are joint tenants, each owns an equal share, which would be a half interest each. But wait, no, wait—no, that's for a tenancy in common. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, no. Joint tenants don't have the right to divide the property. Instead, they share the ownership. So each joint tenant has an undivided interest in the property, each owning a half. But what happens when one joint tenant sells their interest?

So the situation here is that the sister is a joint tenant with her brother. She sells her quitclaim interest to her friend, who doesn't know. I think a quitclaim deed transfers the interest to the grantee without taking ownership. So the friend would have a quitclaim interest in the property, right? But wait, in a joint tenancy, if one joint tenant sells their interest, does the other take the remaining? Or does the transfer affect the joint tenancy?

Wait, let me think about what a quitclaim deed does. A quitclaim deed transfers ownership but doesn't take ownership, so the grantee doesn't own the property. So if the sister sells her quitclaim interest (which is half the property) to the friend, then the friend would have a quitclaim interest. But wait, no—because the sister was a joint tenant. So the sister's quitclaim interest would be in a half of the ranch as a joint tenant. So when she sells her half, the friend gets the other half.

Wait, but the friend was a joint tenant as well. So when the sister sells her interest, the friend would have the other half. So the friend gets an undivided interest in the property. But that would be a one-half interest. But wait, no, because the sister was a joint tenant, the transfer would affect both. Let me try to outline.

In a joint tenancy, all four parties (the two joint tenants and the two other joint tenants) share the property. So each joint tenant owns a 50% interest. So when the sister sells her 50% interest via quitclaim deed, the friend would have the other 50%, but this is through a quitclaim deed. Wait, but wait—does the transfer of a quitclaim deed affect the joint tenancy? Or does the joint tenancy still hold, and the transfer creates a new joint tenancy?

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what happens when one joint tenant sells their interest. In a joint tenancy, each joint tenant has an undivided interest. So the sister's quitclaim deed would transfer her 50% to the friend. But since the sister was a joint tenant, the friend would then have a joint tenancy as well, but with a 50% interest. Or does the transfer break the joint tenancy?

Wait, no, in a joint tenancy, the transfer of an interest doesn't necessarily create a new joint tenancy. Instead, each member holds an undivided interest. So the friend now owns a 50% interest as part of the joint tenancy. But because the transfer was made by the sister, the friend would also have a joint tenancy interest, but does that mean the friend now holds a 50% interest? I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: in a joint tenancy, each joint tenant has an undivided interest in the property. If one joint tenant sells their interest, the other joint tenant takes the remaining interest. So if the sister sells her 50% interest, the brother would take the other 50% as his interest. So the friend now owns 50% as his interest, but is that a one-half interest or a quitclaim?

Wait, no. Because the quitclaim deed means that the friend does not own the property. Wait, but in a joint tenancy, each member holds an undivided interest. So if the sister sells her 50% via quitclaim, the friend gets a quitclaim interest. But wait, no—because the sister was a joint tenant, the quitclaim deed would be in her interest. But in a joint tenancy, the transfer of one member's interest would leave the other member with an undivided interest. Or does it?

Wait, another thought: in a joint tenancy, each member owns an undivided interest. So if the sister sells her interest (50% as a joint tenant), the friend would have the other 50% as his interest, but he doesn't own the property. Wait, but that's not right, because when you transfer a quitclaim interest, the grantee does not take ownership. So if the sister sells her 50% via quitclaim, the friend owns a quitclaim interest in the 50% she sold. But the friend is still part of the joint tenancy; so the friend's interest is 50% as part of the joint tenancy. So the friend owns a 50% interest as a member of the joint tenancy but doesn't own the property. So the friend's interest is a vested remainder? Or a life estate?

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about what each term means.

Vested remainder: ownership that doesn't vest until a certain period. So if the friend has a vested remainder, it's tied to a future event.

Life estate: the right to use the property for a specific period, then the estate passes away. But if the friend took a life estate as part of the joint tenant, would that change? Wait, no, because the transfer is a quitclaim, so the friend's interest is a quitclaim, not a life estate.

Wait, but in a joint tenancy, when one member sells their interest, they don't take ownership. So the friend would have a quitclaim interest in the 50% that the sister sold. But since the sister was a joint tenant, the friend's interest is 50% as a member but not ownership.

Wait, but in a joint tenancy, each member holds an undivided interest. So if the sister sells her 50% via quitclaim, the friend would own 50% as a member, but without ownership. So the friend's interest is an undivided one-half. But does that make it a vested remainder? Because vested remainder requires that the interest vests in the future. If the friend has a 50% interest now, which is part of the joint tenancy, but doesn't take ownership yet, then it's not a vested remainder. Wait, but perhaps it's a vested remainder because it's tied to a specific time.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about what the options are. The options are A to H.

Option D: An undivided one-half interest with right of survivorship.

Option E: An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.

So in a joint tenancy, each member holds an undivided interest. When one member sells their interest, the other member takes the remaining undivided interest without the right of survivorship. So the friend would have a one-half interest without the right of survivorship.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship is a right of the other member to take the remaining interest. So in this case, the friend would have an undivided one-half interest but can't claim it again because the sister's interest is gone.

So the friend has a one-half interest, but without the right of survivorship. So the answer would be E: A leasehold interest in the property? Wait, no, that's not right. Because the friend is a member of the joint tenancy, so they have an undivided interest, not a leasehold.

Wait, no, the friend is a member, so they have an undivided one-half interest. But they don't take ownership unless they sell. Wait, but in the transfer, the friend takes the interest but doesn't own it.

Wait, no, the way a joint tenancy works is that each member holds an undivided interest. So when a member sells their interest, the other member takes the remaining undivided interest. So the friend would have an undivided one-half interest, but as a member, they don't own the property. So the friend's interest is an undivided one-half, but since the sister sold her interest, the friend's interest is the other half. But because it's a joint tenancy, the friend doesn't take ownership, so the right of survivorship doesn't apply because the other member (sister) is still alive. Wait, but in a joint tenancy, the right of survivorship is a right to take the remaining interest. So in this case, the friend has the right of survivorship, but no, because the sister is not the survivor anymore. Wait, no, the right of survivorship is to take the remaining interest. So if the sister is the one who's selling, the friend is the survivor and thus has the right of survivorship.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me restate. In a joint tenancy, if one member sells their interest, the other member (the survivor) takes the remaining undivided interest. So the friend (who is the survivor) would have the right of survivorship. But since the transfer was made by the sister, the friend's interest is an undivided one-half. So the friend has a vested remainder? Or an undivided one-half with the right of survivorship.

Wait, no. The right of survivorship is a feature of the joint tenancy. So the friend would have the right. So the friend's interest is an undivided one-half interest with the right of survivorship. But that's not one of the options. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: vested remainder
B: life estate
C: full ownership
D: undivided one-half with right of survivorship
E: undivided one-half without right of survivor
F: lien against the property
G: tenancy in common with brother
H: leasehold interest

So option D says undivided one-half with right of survivorship. Option E is undivided one-half without right of survivor. So in this case, the friend has an undivided one-half interest, and they have the right of survivorship because the sister is the one selling, so the friend takes the remaining. So the correct answer would be D: an undivided one-half interest with the right of survivorship.

Wait, but I thought the right of survivorship is a feature that the member holds. So the friend has the right of survivorship. So the answer is D.
</think>

In a joint tenancy, each member holds an undivided interest in the property. When one member sells their interest, the other member takes the remaining undivided interest, and they acquire the right of survivorship. In this case, the sister sells her 50% interest via a quitclaim deed to her friend. This transfer leaves the friend with a 50% undivided interest in the property, which is now owned by the friend as part of the joint tenancy. However, the friend does not own the property itself, as the quitclaim deed does not transfer ownership. Therefore, the friend has an undivided one-half interest in the property, but they do not possess the property, and they retain the right of survivorship, as they are the surviving member of the joint tenancy.

**Correct Answer: D: An undivided one-half interest with the right of survivorship.**
