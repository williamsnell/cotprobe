Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is asking which of the given options is not a TV cartoon duo. The options are A through H, each pairing two characters from different shows. 

First, I'll list out the options again for clarity:

A: SpongeBob and Patrick
B: Phineas and Ferb
C: Tom and Jerry
D: Chip and Dale
E: Beavis and Butt-head
F: Pinky and the Brain
G: Scooby and Shaggy
H: Simon and Garfunkel

Hmm, okay, I remember that some of these are classic TV shows. Let me think about each pair. 

SpongeBob and Patrick: I think that's a real TV show. They're best friends, so that's a duo. That's option A, so not the answer.

Phineas and Ferb: Definitely a TV show. They're known for their characters. Option B is correct, not the answer.

Tom and Jerry: That's an animated series from 1998. So, that's a TV show as well. Option C is a pair, so not the answer.

Chip and Dale: I believe this is a TV show. I remember it being from the 80s, maybe on ABC or something. So, option D is a pair, not the answer.

Beavis and Butt-head: That's an animated TV show, known for the "Beavis and Butthead" character. Option E is a pair, so not the answer.

Pinky and the Brain: I'm not sure about this one. Pinky is a character from the show "Pinky and the Brain," but is he paired with someone else? Wait, no, the question is about pairs. So, wait, is Pinky and the Brain a TV show? I think maybe it's not. Or perhaps another option is the correct one.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are given as pairs. So, for example, F is Pinky and the Brain. I think that's a TV show. Or maybe it's not. Alternatively, maybe one of the options is not a TV show.

Wait, what about option G: Scooby and Shaggy. That's definitely a TV show. So, G is a pair.

Option H: Simon and Garfunkel. Oh, I think that's a TV series. Simon and Garfunkel are known for the TV show "Simon and Garfunkel," but wait, is that a TV show? I'm a bit confused. Wait, Simon and Garfunkel is a TV series from the 90s, right? So H is a pair, not the answer.

Wait, waitâ€”Hold on. Let me think again. The question is which one is NOT a TV cartoon duo. So, looking for the pair that doesn't consist of two TV shows.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to eliminate each option.

Option A: Both are TV shows. So, it's a pair. Not the answer.

Option B: Both are TV shows. So, pair. Not the answer.

Option C: Both are TV shows. Pair. Not answer.

Option D: Both are TV shows. Pair. Not answer.

Option E: Both are TV shows. Pair. Not answer.

Option F: Pinky and the Brain. I'm not certain if this is a TV show or not. Wait, I think Pinky and the Brain is a TV show from the 90s. So, F is a pair. So, F is a possible correct answer.

Option G: Both are TV shows. Pair. Not answer.

Option H: Simon and Garfunkel. I remember that's a TV series from the 90s. So, it's a pair. Not the answer.

Wait, so all the options except maybe F are TV show pairs. So F is the one that's not a TV show duo. So the answer would be F.

The correct answer is F: Pinky and the Brain. This pair is not a TV cartoon duo because Pinky and the Brain is a TV show, not a TV cartoon duo. The others (A to H) are all TV show pairs. 

Answer: F
