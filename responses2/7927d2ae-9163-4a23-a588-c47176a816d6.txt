Alright, so I've got this question about different types of selection in biology, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a land snail that can either be cream-colored or solid brown. Intermediate individuals are rare. The options are various types of selection, so I need to associate the scenario with one of those terms.

First, I'll recall what each term means. 

- **Selective pressure** refers to the conditions that favor certain traits. It's about the environment or factors that select for certain traits.
- **Artificial selection** is when humans or other organisms select for certain traits, leading to the accumulation of those traits over generations.
- **Neutral selection** means that traits don't have any positive or negative effect on survival or reproduction. They just aren't favored or disfavored.
- **Sexual selection** is where traits are selected based on the sexual characteristics of an organism. So, for example, if males choose certain traits, it's sexual selection.
- **Diversifying selection** involves the process by which different species or forms of a species are selected for, leading to more diversity.
- **Directional selection** is when the environment pushes certain traits to be more common, like if something is beneficial for survival in a particular environment.
- **Frequency-dependent selection** is when the fitness of a trait depends on the frequency of another trait. So, one trait may be favored in the presence of others.
- **Stabilizing selection** is when intermediate traits are selected against, leading to the average trait to be favored. This tends to smooth out differences.
- **Balancing selection** occurs when two opposing factors are selected against, leading to a narrow range of viable traits.
- **Directional selection** (I think this is the same as directional, maybe a typo) is when one direction is favored, so traits move in one direction.

Now, looking at the question again: the land snail is either cream or brown, with intermediate rare. So, the two distinct colors are the possible phenotypes. The intermediate individuals are rare, which probably means that the color variation isn't being maintained by selection, but instead is being maintained by another mechanism.

Wait, but the question is about the term that best describes the situation. The species can be either cream or brown, so it's a diploid organism, right? So if the intermediate are rare, that suggests that the traits aren't being under strong selection against each other. If selection is acting on one color, the other might be favored. But the intermediate are rare, which suggests that those intermediates are not present in the population, so selection is acting on the two extremes.

Wait, but the question isn't about a scenario where one color is favored, but rather that the two colors are present in the population, but with intermediate individuals being rare. So the selection is acting on the two extremes, not on the intermediate. So the presence of two distinct phenotypes with intermediate rare suggests that selection is acting on the two extremes.

But wait, the question is phrased as the species "exists as either a cream color or a solid brown color. Intermediate individuals are relatively rare." So the two colors are present, but the ones in between are rare. So selection is acting on the two extremes, so that the intermediate aren't maintained. That is, the intermediate isn't favored, so it's not under selection, but rather selection is acting to maintain the two extremes.

But the question is asking which term best describes the situation. So the term that describes when two distinct phenotypes are maintained with intermediate rare is stabilizing selection. Because stabilizing selection favors the extremes and reduces or eliminates the intermediate. Alternatively, this is called frequency-dependent selection if it's about the frequency of traits, but that's not exactly the same.

Wait, but wait, the concept of frequency-dependent selection is when the fitness of a trait depends on the frequency of another trait. For example, if a trait is rare, its presence can affect the fitness of other traits. But in this case, the two colors are present, and the intermediate is rare. So perhaps the intermediate isn't under selection, and the two extremes are favored.

Alternatively, maybe it's more about stabilizing selection. Because when selection acts on the extremes, the intermediates are not maintained. So, the two colors are maintained, but the intermediate is not, which is consistent with stabilizing selection.

Wait, but another thought: if selection is acting on the two extremes, the intermediates aren't selected against, so they don't appear. So the presence of the two colors is maintained, but the intermediates are not. So the term would be stabilizing selection.

Looking at the options, I think the correct term is stabilizing selection. So which option is that? Let me check the options again. 

Options:
A: selective pressure
B: artificial selection
C: neutral selection
D: sexual selection
E: diversifying selection
F: directional selection
G: frequency-dependent selection
H: disruptive selection
I: stabilizing selection
J: balancing selection

So option I is stabilizing selection. Therefore, the answer should be I.

The question describes a land snail species that exists as either a cream color or a solid brown color, with intermediate individuals being relatively rare. This scenario indicates that selection is acting on the two extreme phenotypes, cream and brown, rather than on the intermediate phenotypes. 

To determine the correct term, we analyze the options:

- **Stabilizing selection** is characterized by the selection of traits that favor the extremes, reducing the presence of intermediate phenotypes. This aligns with the situation described, where the intermediate individuals are rare.
- Other terms like **artificial selection**, **natural selection**, **frequency-dependent selection**, **diversifying selection**, **directional selection**, **frequency-dependent selection**, **stabilizing selection**, and **balancing selection** do not fully capture the scenario. 

Thus, the best description is **stabilizing selection**, which fits the scenario of maintaining the two extreme colors with the intermediate being rare.

**Answer: I: stabilizing selection**
