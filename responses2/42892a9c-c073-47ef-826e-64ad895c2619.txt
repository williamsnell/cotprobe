Hmm, okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about nations and their characteristics. Let me try to think through each option carefully. 

The question asks which statement does not describe nations. So, I need to find the option that's incorrect about what nations are.

Option A: Nations may be difficult to distinguish from societies. Wait, I remember that nations are often considered a higher level than societies. Societies are more fragmented, while nations are more cohesive. So, I think A is correct because nations are distinct from societies, but maybe not the same. Alternatively, I'm not entirely sure. I'll come back to this.

Option B: Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state. I know that nations are often divided by borders, like countries, so this seems correct. So B is a correct statement, so it can't be the answer.

Option C: Nations may be made up of different ethnic-identity groups. That makes sense. Nations often have multiple ethnic groups, especially in places like Africa or Latin America. So C is a correct statement, so it's not the answer.

Option D: Nations may contain multiple religious identity groups. That's also true. Many nations have various religious backgrounds, especially in places like Asia or in countries with diverse religious practices. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement must be option A. Because nations are distinct from societies, but societies themselves are more fragmented. So A is correct, meaning the incorrect statement is A. Therefore, the answer is A.
