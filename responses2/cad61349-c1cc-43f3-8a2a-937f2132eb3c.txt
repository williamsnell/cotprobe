Okay, so I've got this economics question here about why in a perfectly competitive market, firms paying higher wages cause their workforce to be more demanding. Let me think through this.

Alright, the question is asking why, as a group, when a firm hires more workers, the wage rate goes up. The options are A to J, each giving a different reason.

I remember that in a perfectly competitive market, each firm is a price taker, meaning they can't influence the market price. But when they hire more workers, they have to adjust their wages. So, let's break it down.

In a perfectly competitive labor market, the demand for labor comes from multiple firms. Each firm is hiring workers to produce goods, and the market determines the wage rate. Now, if a firm wants to hire more workers, they have to offer a higher wage. If they don't, they might not attract enough workers because the market can't easily change the wage without affecting profits.

Wait, but in a perfectly competitive labor market, workers are price-takers too. So, each firm's decision isn't just about their own costs but also how it affects the market. If a firm wants to hire more workers, they have to set a higher wage. Otherwise, they might lose workers because the market price for their product doesn't change, so their cost (wage) doesn't justify their profit.

So, the initial thought is that when the number of workers increases, the demand for labor goes up. But the supply of labor is also affectedâ€”each firm wants to hire more, so the supply increases. But in a competitive market, the equilibrium wage is determined by the intersection of supply and demand. If the number of workers increases, the demand for labor increases, which, if supply remains the same, would lead to a higher equilibrium wage.

Alternatively, maybe the question is more about the firm's own motivation. Firms are trying to maximize profits. The marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker. If the wage is too low, the firm might not cover the cost of the additional worker. So, to get workers, the firm must at least match the wage rate. If the wage is higher, the firm can cover more of the MRP and still make a profit.

Wait, but the question is about why the wage must go up. So, if a firm wants to hire more workers, it's because the market wants to have more workers. The equilibrium is where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. If the number of workers increases, the demand for labor increases, leading to an increase in the wage. So, the firms, as a group, are forced to pay higher wages to attract the additional workers.

Looking at the options, option C says, "Firms must raise wages to attract more workers." That seems to fit. Because if the industry's demand for labor increases, each firm has to set a higher wage to meet that demand.

Alternatively, option E is "Firms have a surplus of workers." That would mean the supply exceeds demand, which would lead to lower wages because the surplus workers can be hired at a lower rate. But the question is about why wage rates increase when more workers are hired, so that would mean the demand for workers is higher, not the supply.

Wait another thought: If the market is perfectly competitive, the number of workers is determined by the demand (firms want more workers) and the supply (firms want to hire as many as they can). So, when the number of workers increases, the demand for them increases. If the supply remains the same, the equilibrium wage must increase to allow firms to hire more. So, each firm, as a group, must raise their wages.

So, the correct reasoning is that when firms hire more workers, the demand for labor goes up, which requires higher wages. So the correct answer should be option C.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms hire more workers, increasing the demand for labor. This higher demand leads to an increase in the wage rate because the market adjusts to equilibrium, where the quantity supplied of labor equals the quantity demanded. Firms, as a group, must raise wages to attract more workers, which aligns with option C.

Answer: C
