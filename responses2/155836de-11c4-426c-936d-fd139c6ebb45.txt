Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question. So, the question is about two statements regarding machine learning models, specifically ResNets and their performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: "As of 2020, some models attain greater than 98% accuracy on CIFAR-10." Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second—did I get that right? I think I might be confusing ResNets with some other models. Oh yeah, ResNets are a type of deep neural network. So in 2020, what was the situation? I remember reading that ResNets had some limitations. Oh right, like the " Commonsense dataset" problem. Wait, but wait, another point: in 2017, it was said that ResNets couldn't reach 99% accuracy on CIFAR-10. But in 2020, maybe the community found a way around that. Or perhaps another model, like ResNet-50 or others, achieved higher. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh, perhaps the statement is incorrect because I think ResNets didn't surpass 98% until later. So maybe Statement 1 is false because as of 2020, some models (maybe others like ResNet-50 or others) can achieve over 98% accuracy. Or perhaps the statement is correct because ResNets themselves couldn't do it that well. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: maybe Statement 1 is correct because, as of 2020, some models, perhaps including ResNets, achieved very high accuracy. Or perhaps the statement is incorrect because I've heard that ResNets from the 90s couldn't achieve that, and models after that (like 2017-2020) have improved a lot, but maybe not that high. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is correct, and the current state is higher than 98%. Hmm.

Now, Statement 2: "The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer." Oh, right, because the original ResNets were designed with different optimizers. The original ResNets used the momentum optimizer, like Adam, but the implementation might have been different. Wait, no, the original ResNets were optimized with the Adam optimizer. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe the original ResNets used a different optimizer like SGD. Or perhaps the initial version of ResNets used a different optimizer. Wait, I think the original ResNets were optimized with the Adam optimizer. Because Adam was introduced in a later paper. So, Statement 2 is false because the original ResNets were optimized with Adam.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The original ResNet paper from 1992 was the foundation. But for the optimization, I think in the 90s, people used different optimizers. The Adam optimizer was introduced in a 2015 paper. So if the original ResNets were using Adam, then Statement 2 is false. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again: the original ResNets (like 1992) were implemented in a way that didn't use Adam. Or were they? Or perhaps the original ResNets were implemented with the AdaProp optimizer, which is similar to Adam. So, perhaps the original ResNets didn't use Adam, making Statement 2 correct.

Wait, but the original ResNets paper used the Adam optimizer. I think that's right. So Statement 2 is false if the original ResNets were optimized with Adam. So Statement 1: does ResNets reach over 98% in 2020? I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to models that are optimized with Adam. Wait, I'm confused now.

Wait, perhaps Statement 1 is correct. Because in 2020, other models like ResNet-50 or others achieved higher than 98% on CIFAR-10. So, maybe the original ResNets (1992) couldn't reach that, but other models after that did. So Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but the question says "some models attain greater than 98% accuracy." So maybe the original ResNets (from 1992) couldn't, but others (like ResNet-50 in 2015) did. So Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: Original ResNets used Adam? Or not. I think the original ResNets were implemented with the AdaProp (Adaptive Propagation) optimizer, which is similar to Adam but was different. Alternatively, perhaps the original ResNets used a different optimizer. Wait, the original ResNets paper from 1992 used the AdaProp algorithm, which is similar to Adam. So, I think Statement 2 is true because the original ResNets were not optimized with Adam. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Because in some contexts, I've heard that the original ResNets were optimized with Adam. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the original ResNets were not optimized with Adam, but in 2020, maybe the community found better models that do. So if Statement 1 is about some models (like ResNet-50) achieving over 98%, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false because the original ResNets were optimized with Adam.

So, Statement 1: true.

Statement 2: false.

But wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to find a clear answer.

Statement 1: Correct or incorrect? As of 2020, some models (like ResNet-50) have over 98% accuracy on CIFAR. So Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: Original ResNets were not optimized with Adam. Well, the original ResNets (1992) used AdaProp, which is similar to Adam. So Statement 2 is true because the original ResNets were optimized with Adam.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because in some sources, I've read that the original ResNets were not optimized with Adam, but maybe they used AdaProp, which is sometimes referred to as Adam in practice.

Alternatively, perhaps the original ResNets were implemented without Adam and were optimized with a different approach. So, perhaps Statement 2 is correct as well.

Wait, but the wording is: "The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer." So, if the original ResNets used Adam, then Statement 2 is false. If they didn't, then Statement 2 is true.

So, the confusion arises on whether the original ResNets used Adam.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of famous models. The first ResNet (1993) used AdaProp (Adaptive Propagation), which is similar to Adam. So, perhaps the original ResNets were optimized with Adam. Alternatively, maybe the original ResNets were optimized with AdaProp, which is considered a version of Adam.

So, if Statement 2 is claiming that the original ResNets were not optimized with Adam, but in reality, they were, then Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait. Another point: different sources might have different perspectives. For example, a 2020 paper might say that the original ResNets didn't perform well, but then another paper found that ResNets with certain optimizations (like layer normalization) could get higher. So, perhaps the original ResNets (like 1992) didn't reach 98%, but 2020's models like ResNet-50 did.

So, Statement 1 is true because some (like ResNet-50) achieved above 98% in 2020.

Statement 2 is false because the original ResNets were optimized with the Adam optimizer.

So, Statement 1 is true (T), Statement 2 is false (F). So, what does that mean? Let's see the answer options.

Looking at the options, I need to find the pair where Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.

Looking at the options:

A: False, False → both wrong.

B: Both somewhat true → not likely.

C: False, True → Statement 1 wrong, statement 2 correct. So if Statement 1 is correct, this can't be.

Wait, but according to our analysis, Statement 1 is correct, Statement 2 is incorrect.

So which option has (True, False)? Looking at the options:

Looking back at the options: 

Wait, let me review the options.

Options:

A: False, False → both wrong.

B: Both somewhat true → probably not.

C: False, True → Statement 1 is wrong, 2 is correct.

D: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is somewhat false → Hmm, but according to our analysis, Statement 2 is false. So D says Statement 2 is somewhat false, which would make Statement 2 incorrect.

Wait, but no. Because in my analysis, Statement 2 is false. So looking for a pair where 1 is true and 2 is false.

Looking back at the options, the only option with 1: true and 2: false is option D: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is somewhat false. Wait, no, because I think statement 2 is definitely false.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is, which option correctly represents the truth of the statements.

So, Statement 1: Some models (maybe ResNet-50) attain >98% in 2020.

Statement 2: Original ResNets (1992) were not optimized with Adam. So, wait, if the original ResNets used a different optimizer, then statement 2 is true. But I'm more confident now that the original ResNets used Adam, making statement 2 false.

So, if statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false, which option is that?

Looking at the options, what's option D: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is somewhat false. So that's not it. Because D says statement 2 is somewhat false, but our analysis says statement 2 is definitely false.

Wait, let me check each option again.

Option D: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is somewhat false. "Somewhat false" would mean it's not completely false, but maybe false in a way that's not strongly incorrect. But according to our analysis, statement 2 is definitely false. So option D is not correct.

Wait, then look for option where statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Statement1 is true, Statement2 is somewhat false. So statement 2 is somewhat false, but according to our analysis, it's false. So this option is incorrect.

Option E: Statement1 is false, Statement2 is mostly true. So both are wrong, which can't be.

Option B: both somewhat true. So both statements are somewhat true. Are either true? I think statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false. So no.

Option G: True, True → both true. No, because statement 2 is false.

Option H: Both are somewhat false. No, because statement 1 is true.

Option F: Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false. So 1 is true, 2 is false. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the statements. So if statement1 is true and statement2 is false, which option has that?

Looking at the options again:

Option F: Statement1 is mostly true, Statement2 is false. So it's correct.

Wait, but the options are:

A: F,F

B: both somewhat true

C: F, T

D: T, somewhat F

E: T, mostly F → but statement1 is true, statement2 is somewhat false.

Wait, but I think statement 2 is definitely false. So, which options have statement1: true and statement2: false.

Looking again:

Option F: Statement1 is mostly true, Statement2 is false. → So, statement1 is true, statement2 is false.

But the options don't have an option with that. Wait, looking at the options given:

Options:

A: False, False → both wrong.

B: Both somewhat true → no.

C: False, True → statement1 is false, statement2 is true. So statement1 is false, 2 is true. So both are wrong. So not correct.

D: Statement1 is true, statement2 is somewhat false. → So, statement1 is true, statement2 is not completely false. But according to our analysis, statement2 is definitely false. So statement2 is false, not 'somewhat false'. So option D is incorrect.

E: Statement1 is false, statement2 is mostly true. → Both are wrong.

F: Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false. → So statement1 is true, statement2 is not true. So statement2 is false. So this could be correct if the statement2 is false, but the option is that statement2 is mostly false. So, but in our analysis, statement2 is definitely false. So option F is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about statement 2.

Statement 2: "The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer."

I think the original ResNets used the AdaProp optimizer, which is similar to Adam. So, if the original ResNets were not optimized with Adam, statement 2 is true. But I'm not certain.

If statement 2 is true, then the correct option would be D: Statement1 is true, Statement2 is somewhat false. But statement2 is not somewhat false; it's definitely false. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option.

Which option has statement1 as true and statement2 as false?

Looking:

D: Statement1 is true, Statement2 is somewhat false. → statement2 is not false. So option D is incorrect.

F: Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false. → statement1 is true, statement2 is false. So this fits. But I'm not sure if statement1 is mostly true.

Wait, maybe statement1 is false. Because as of 2020, some models do not exceed 98% accuracy. Or perhaps the statement is about the original ResNets not surpassing 98% in 2020, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe statement1 is correct, and statement2 is false.

So, the correct answer is option D: Statement1 is true, Statement2 is somewhat false. No, because statement2 is definitely false, so option D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me try to approach this differently.

Statement 1 is true because some models (like ResNet-50) achieve >98% accuracy in 2020.

Statement 2 is false because the original ResNets used Adam. So, the correct option is which one has statement1 as true, statement2 as false.

Looking at the options:

Looking for option F: Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false. So if statement1 is true (as it is), then option F is correct.

But the options don't have "mostly true" and "false." Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

The options are:

A: False, False → both wrong.

B: Both somewhat true → unlikely.

C: False, True → statement1 is false, statement2 is true. So statement1 is false, statement2 is true. So both are wrong.

D: Statement1 is true, Statement2 is somewhat false. So statement2 is not completely false. Which is incorrect.

E: Statement1 is false, statement2 is mostly true. So both are wrong.

F: Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false. So statement1 is true, statement2 is false. So that's correct.

Wait, but the options don't have "mostly true" for statement1. So, perhaps it's a typo and they mean "correct" or "false." So, if statement1 is correct, and statement2 is false, the correct option is F.

But wait, according to the options, option F is "Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false." So, if statement1 is correct, that would fit, but the option is "mostly true." Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps statement1 is false. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the 2020 accuracy of some models wrong. Maybe some models didn't reach 98% in 2020, but others did.

Wait, perhaps statement1 is true because in 2020, ResNet-50 and others achieved 99.5% and above. So, statement1 is correct.

So, the correct option is one where statement1 is true, statement2 is false. The only option that fits this is option D: Statement1 is true, statement2 is somewhat false. But wait, no. Because statement2 is definitely false. So option D is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again about statement 2.

Statement 2: The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer.

The original ResNets used the AdaProp optimizer. So statement2 is false.

So, the correct answer is the option where statement1 is true, statement2 is false. Looking at the options, the only option that meets this is option F: "Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false." But the wording in option F says "mostly true," which is not exactly correct because statement1 is definitely true.

Hmm, but the options don't have an option where statement1 is true and statement2 is false. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking again:

The options are:

A: False, False → both wrong.

B: Both somewhat true → unlikely.

C: False, True → statement1 is wrong, statement2 is correct.

D: Statement1 is true, statement2 is somewhat false → statement1 is correct, statement2 is not correct.

E: Statement1 is false, statement2 is mostly true → both wrong.

F: Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false → statement1 is correct (if "mostly true" is how it's worded), statement2 is false.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confused about the options' wording. Let me re-examine the options:

Option F says "Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false." So statement1 is true (mostly true is correct), statement2 is false.

So in this case, the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but earlier I thought statement2 is definitely false, so option F is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the analysis, statement1 is true, statement2 is false.

So the correct option is F, but that's not the case because statement2 is definitely false.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the options. Let me read them again.

Option F: Statement1 is mostly true, statement2 is false. So statement1 is true (as it is), statement2 is false.

So, if statement1 is true (as it is) and statement2 is false (as it is), then option F is correct.

But according to the options, none of them have statement1 as true and statement2 as false. Only option F has statement2 as false. So, perhaps option F is correct.

Wait, but in reality, statement2 is definitely false. So, the correct answer is the option where statement1 is true and statement2 is false. But the options don't have such an option. Wait, the options are:

A: False, False

B: Both somewhat true

C: False, True

D: Statement1 true, statement2 somewhat false

E: Statement1 false, statement2 mostly true

F: Statement1 mostly true, statement2 is false.

Wait, perhaps the options are meant to be read as:

A: Both statements are false

B: Both statements are somewhat true (e.g., both are somewhat correct but not completely true)

C: First statement is false, second is true.

D: First is true, second is somewhat false.

E: First is false, second is mostly true.

F: First is somewhat true, second is false.

G: Both are true.

H: Both are false.

So, according to this, option F is correct because statement1 is "mostly true" (which is correct, since it's true) and statement2 is "false."

But according to our analysis, statement2 is definitely false. So, option F would be correct.

Wait, but the options don't have "mostly true" for statement1. So perhaps the options are intended to be read as:

option F: Statement1 is true, statement2 is false.

So, even if the options are written differently, the correct option is F.

Wait, but the options as given don't have option F. Let me check the options again.

The user provided:

The options are:

A: False, False

B: Both somewhat true

C: False, True

D: Statement1 is true, Statement2 is somewhat false

E: Statement1 is false, Statement2 is mostly true

F: Statement1 is mostly true, Statement2 is false

G: Both are true

H: Both are false

So, according to this, the correct option is F. Because statement1 is true (as it is) and statement2 is false.

So, the answer is F.
</think>

The correct answer is **F: Statement1 is mostly true, Statement2 is false**.

### Breakdown:
- **Statement 1**: Some models (e.g., ResNet-50) achieve >98% accuracy in 2020. This is correct.
- **Statement 2**: The original ResNets were not optimized with Adam. This is incorrect, as the original ResNets used the AdaProp optimizer, which is similar to Adam.

Thus, the correct option is **F**, as it reflects the truth of Statement 1 and the falsity of Statement 2.
