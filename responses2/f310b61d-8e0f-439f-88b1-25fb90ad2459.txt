Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a silvered glass sphere. The sphere has a radius R and an index of refraction of 1.50. It's silvered over one hemisphere, meaning that the curved part is now a mirror. There's a small object located on the axis of the sphere at a distance 2R from the unsilvered surface. I need to find where the image forms after considering both the refracting and reflecting surfaces.

Hmm. Silvered surfaces are like mirrors. So the glass sphere is now a spherical mirror. The object is at 2R from the non-silvered surface. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup here. Because the sphere is silvered over one hemisphere, so the curved part is a mirror. The flat part is the other hemisphere, but it's not silvered. So the object is placed somewhere relative to the sphere.

The object is on the axis of the sphere. That probably means it's aligned along the mirror surface. So the distance from the object to the non-silvered (flat) surface is 2R. Wait, but the sphere's radius is R, so the total length from the center to the flat surface must be R. So if the object is 2R from the flat surface, that would place it 2R + R = 3R from the center of the sphere. So the object is on the same side as the flat part, right? Or wait, maybe the object is on the same side as the flat part. Or perhaps on the opposite side? Wait, no. The sphere's flat part is at a distance R from the center. So the non-silvered part is on one side of the sphere's center, and the silvered (mirror) part is the other side. So the flat surface is at a distance R from the center of the sphere.

Wait, no. The sphere's radius is R, so the center is at the midpoint between the two hemispheres. So the flat part is at a distance R from the center. So the non-silvered surface is at a distance R from the center towards one direction, and the silvered surface is at the other side, another R from the center. So if the object is 2R from the non-silvered surface, that is, it's on the other side of the flat part from the silvered surface.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me imagine the sphere. The flat part is a flat surface, say, the left side. The silvered part is the right side. The center is in between. So the flat surface is at x = -R, and the silvered part is at x = +R. The object is on the axis of the sphere. So it's somewhere along the x-axis. The question says it's located at a distance 2R from the unsilvered surface. So the distance from the object to the non-silvered surface (the left flat part) is 2R. That would put the object at x = 2R. But since the flat part is at x = -R, the distance from the object to the flat surface is 2R. That would mean the object is 2R away from the flat side, so it's 2R + R = 3R away from the center. Because the flat surface is at -R from the center, so 2R from it is 3R from the center. So the object is at x=3R on the right side (since the flat part is at x=-R, which is -R from center, and the silvered part is at +R, which is R from the center, so the object is at 3R, which is beyond the silvered part on the right side).

Wait, but the object is on the axis of the sphere. The axis is the line from the center to the circumference. So if the sphere's flat part is on one side (say left) and the silvered part on the right, the object is on the same side as the silvered part. So the object is 3R from the center. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the sphere is silvered over the curved part, so it's a concave mirror (since the curved part is the mirror surface). Wait, wait. Silvering a glass sphere over one hemisphere makes the surface a concave mirror. Because the curved surface is acting like a mirror. So when a wave hits the curved surface, it reflects as if it's a mirror. So the object is placed 3R from the center, which is 3R - R = 2R from the flat surface (non-silvered), and 3R - R = 2R from the opposite end, which is the silvered surface.

Wait, but wait, the object is 2R away from the non-silvered surface. So 2R away from the flat part, which is at x=-R. So the object is at x= 2R (since the flat part is at x=-R, so 2R from that is at x= (-R) + 2R = R. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

If the flat surface is at x=-R (left), then the distance from the object to the flat surface is 2R. So the object is 2R from x=-R. So, x = (-R) + 2R = R. So the object is at x=R (right side of the sphere). Because the flat surface is at x=-R, so the object is 2R away from there. So x= (x of flat surface) + 2R = (-R) + 2R = R. So the object is at x= R.

But wait, the object is on the axis of the sphere. The sphere's radius is R, so the center is at x=0. The flat surface is x=-R, and the silvered surface is x=R. So the object is at x=R, which is exactly at the edge of the silvered surface. So the object is placed right at the point where the silvered surface is. Hmm, that's interesting. So the object is right at the edge of the mirror.

Now, the question is, what's the image formed by the refracting and reflecting surfaces of the sphere. Wait, the sphere is a concave mirror. So the object is placed at x=R, which is exactly on the mirror. So when an object is placed at a distance equal to the radius of the mirror, which is the focal point, the image forms at infinity. But wait, let me think. For a concave mirror, the focal length f is R/2. Because the focal length is half the radius for a spherical mirror.

So for a concave mirror, the focal length f is R/2. So if the object is at a distance equal to f (R/2), then the image is at infinity. But here, the object is at x= R, which is 2f (since f= R/2, 2f= R). So the object is placed at twice the focal length. So what happens then?

Wait, for a spherical mirror, the object distance u = 2f. The image distance v can be found using the mirror equation: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

Plugging in u=2f, 1/f = (1/(2f)) + (1/v).

Multiply both sides by f:

1 = (1/2) + (f/v) → (f/v) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 → v = 2f.

Wait, but wait, that's the case for a real image (if the object is between f and infinity, the image is real and at 2f). Oh wait no, wait. For a concave mirror, when the object is placed at twice the focal length (u=2f), the image is formed at the same distance on the other side (v=2f). But wait, that's only if the object is placed beyond 2f. Oh wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the mirror equation is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

So if u is positive for a concave mirror when the object is on the same side as the incoming light (the usual convention), but wait, for a concave mirror, which is a positive curvature, the usual sign conventions are that the object is placed in front of the mirror (u is positive), the focal length is positive, and the image distance is positive if the image is real, negative if virtual.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of sign conventions. Let me recall: For a spherical mirror,

u is negative if the object is on the same side as the incoming light (the object side), and positive if on the opposite side.

Wait, no, wait. In the standard setup, the object is placed in front of the mirror, so u is positive. The focal length f is positive for concave mirrors. The image distance v is positive for real images (on the same side as the object), and negative for virtual images (on the opposite side).

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. If the object is on the same side as the incoming light (like in a convex mirror), the object distance is positive. The image distance for a convex mirror is negative because the image is virtual and behind the mirror.

Wait, no, perhaps the sign conventions are as follows:

- For a spherical mirror, the object is on the same side as the incoming light (object side), so u is positive.

- The focal length is positive for concave mirrors (since the center of curvature is on the same side as the incoming light).

- The image is formed on the opposite side if it's real (v positive), or on the same side if it's virtual (v negative).

Wait, no, that can't be right because images formed by mirrors are always on the opposite side, whether real or virtual. So perhaps the correct sign for the image distance is positive for real images (same side as the object) and negative for virtual images (opposite side).

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me look for a standard approach.

The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

For a concave mirror, f is positive. So for u = 2f (which is positive), 1/f = 1/(2f) + 1/v.

Multiply both sides by f:

1 = (1/2) + (f/v) → (f/v) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 → v = 2f.

So v is positive, which means the image is in front of the mirror, same side as the object. So it's a real image. But wait, if the object is placed at u=2f, which is in front of the mirror, the image is formed at v=2f on the same side. Wait, that would imply that the image is at the same distance, but on the same side as the object. That's possible only if the object is on the same side as the image, which would require a real image. But in that case, the image is at 2f.

Wait, for example, if the object is at u=2f (which is beyond the focal length), the image forms at v=2f, which is on the same side as the object. So the image is in front of the mirror, same side as the object. So in this case, the image is a real image.

Wait, but in the case of a concave mirror, if the object is placed beyond the focal length (u > f), the image is real and located at a distance v=2f on the same side. So the image is real, located at 2f from the mirror.

So in this problem, the object is at u = 2R, which is 2R = 2 * (R/2) = 2f. So u=2f, and so v=2f.

So the image is located 2f from the mirror surface, on the same side as the object. So in terms of the sphere, what's the location?

The mirror is the curved part, the silvered surface. The object is at a distance of 2R from the non-silvered surface (the flat part), which is located at x=-R. So the object is at x= R (distance from the center). The image is at 2f = R from the mirror.

Wait, the mirror is the silvered part, so the mirror's surface is at x=R. So if the image is 2f = R from the mirror, but in which direction? Since the object was to the left of the mirror (x=-R for flat, x=R for mirror), and the image is on the same side, the image is at x = R - (2f - R) ? Hmm, no. Let me think in terms of the mirror's position.

Wait, the mirror is located at x=R. The object is at x=R as well. Because earlier calculation said the object is at x=R. Wait, that can't be right. Because if the object is at x=R, but the mirror is at x=R, then the object is exactly at the mirror's surface. But wait, the mirror is the silvered part. So the object is located at x=R. The mirror is at x=R. So the object is on the surface of the mirror. So the image would be at 2f = R from the mirror, but on the same side as the object. So at x= R - (2f) = R - R = 0. Wait, no, because 2f = R, so the image is at x= R + 2f? Wait, no, the image is at v=2f, which is on the same side as the object, which is at x=R. So the image is at x = R + 2f? But wait 2f is R, so x would be R + R = 2R.

Wait, but for the mirror, the image is at v=2f, which is to the right of the mirror. So if the mirror is at x=R, the image is at x=R + 2f. Since f=R/2, 2f=R, so x = R + R = 2R.

Wait, but wait, the mirror is the silvered part. So the object is at x=R, and the image is at x=2R. So the image is at 2R from the center, which is 2R - R = R from the mirror's surface. Because the mirror is at x=R, so the image is at x=2R. So 2R - R = R. So the image is R from the mirror's surface.

But wait, in the options, let me look.

The options are about the position from the spherical glass surface and the mirror surface.

The options are:

A: 4R from the mirror surface.

B: R from the spherical glass surface.

C: 2R from the mirror surface.

D: 2R from the glass surface.

E: 4R from the glass surface.

F: R/2 from the glass surface.

G: 5R from the glass surface.

H: R from the mirror surface.

I: 3R from the glass surface.

J: 3R from the mirror surface.

Wait, so the image is at 2R from the mirror surface. So the answer should be C? Because the image is 2R away from the mirror surface.

But wait, let me double-check.

The object is at x=R (mirror surface). The image is at x=2R (mirror surface). So from the mirror surface, the image is at 2R.

But wait, the options mention either the mirror surface or the glass surface. Wait, the sphere's surface is a combination of flat and curved. The flat part is at x=-R, the glass (mirror) part is at x=R. So the image is at 2R from the mirror surface (x=R). The options say "from the spherical glass surface", which is the curved part. So the image is 2R from the spherical glass surface. So option C is 2R from the mirror surface. But the question says "from the spherical glass surface", which is the curved part, so it's 2R.

Wait, but wait, the image is at x=2R (spherical glass surface). So option C is 2R from the spherical glass surface. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I got the mirror equation wrong, but in this case, the object is placed exactly at the mirror surface. So the image is at v=2f, which is 2*(R/2)= R. So the image is 2f from the mirror, but wait, no, 2f is R. So the image is R from the mirror surface on the same side as the object.

Wait, but wait, the object is at x=R, and the image is at x=2R. So the image is 2R from the mirror's surface, on the same side as the object. So the image is 2R from the mirror surface. So the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, let me think about it another way. The object is at u=2R from the flat surface, which is at x=-R. So the object is at x=R. The mirror is at x=R as well. So the object is on the mirror's surface. So the image is at x=2R, which is on the mirror's surface. So the image is 2R from the mirror's surface, which is option C. So I think option C is the correct answer.

The problem involves a silvered glass sphere of radius \( R \) and refractive index \( 1.50 \), with one hemisphere silvered over the curved surface. The flat surface is \( R \) units away from the center of the sphere. A small object is placed on the axis of the sphere, \( 2R \) units away from the unsilvered (flat) surface, which places the object \( R \) units away from the center of the sphere. The object is located on the surface of the silvered (curved) part of the sphere, \( x = R \), since the flat surface is at \( x = -R \).

The mirror equation for a spherical mirror is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v},
\]

where \( f \) is the focal length, \( u \) is the object distance, and \( v \) is the image distance. For a concave mirror, the focal length \( f \) is \( R/2 \). Substituting \( u = 2R \) (which is \( 2f \) for a concave mirror), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{2f} + \frac{1}{v}.
\]

Multiplying through by \( f \), we get:

\[
1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{f}{v} \implies \frac{f}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \implies v = 2f.
\]

Since \( f = R/2 \), this gives \( v = 2(R/2) = R \). Therefore, the image is located \( R \) units away from the surface of the mirror (silvered part of the sphere). 

The options provided describe the position of the image relative to the spherical glass surface (the curved part of the sphere). The image is \( R \) units away from the spherical glass surface, which corresponds to **option C**.
