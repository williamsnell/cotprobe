Question:

How has the role of internal body secretions in behavior been demonstrated in silk worms?

Options:

A: Silk worms spin cocoons based on the phase of the moon
B: Silk worm behavior is controlled by external stimuli
C: Silk worms only spin cocoons in the presence of light
D: Silk worms spin cocoons based on their age
E: Silk worms spin cocoons when they sense vibrations
F: Silk worm cocoon spinning is triggered by the silk worm's diet
G: Silk worm larvae spin cocoons in response to changes in temperature
H: Silk worms spin cocoons when juvenile hormone levels are high
I: Cocoon-spinning behavior of silk worm larvae is controlled by hormones
J: Cocoon spinning is a learned behavior in silk worms

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about silk worms and their behavior involving internal body secretions. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question asks how the role of internal body secretions in behavior has been demonstrated in silk worms. The options are A through J, each describing different behaviors based on internal factors like diet, age, or stimuli.

Hmm, I remember that in biology, internal body functions are often regulated by hormones. So, for example, when a silk worm's diet changes, it might alter the release of hormones, which in turn affects its behavior. That makes me think about option B and H.

Option B says, "Silk worm behavior is controlled by external stimuli." Wait, that doesn't sound right because if it's controlled by external stimuli, it's more about responses to things like light or sound. But I'm not sure if the question is about external stimuli or internal factors. The question specifically mentions internal body secretions, so maybe it's about what's internal.

Option H says, "Silk worms spin cocoons when juvenile hormone levels are high." Juvenile hormones, like gonadotropins, are indeed involved in various behaviors, including reproductive responses. So if the spin of the cocoons depends on hormone levels, that would involve internal mechanisms. That seems to fit.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let's think again. Option A talks about spinning cocoons based on the moon's phase. I'm not sure if that's a known behavior of silk worms. I think more commonly, behavior is tied to external stimuli, like light or other signals. So perhaps A isn't the right choice.

Option B is about external stimuli, so that might not be the role of internal secretions. So H seems more about internal responses.

Other options: G talks about temperature changes, which I'm not sure are part of the usual behaviors. D is age-related, which is possible but less common. F is about diet, which could involve internal factors, but the question is about how internal secretions are demonstrated, so that's more about external cues.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H, because it directly links the spinning of cocoons to the level of juvenile hormones, which are internal. Thus, the answer is H.

The correct answer is H. Silk worms spin cocoons when juvenile hormone levels are high, demonstrating how internal body secretions influence their behavior through hormone regulation.

Answer: H
