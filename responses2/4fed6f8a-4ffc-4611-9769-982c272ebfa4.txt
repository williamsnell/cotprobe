Okay, so I have this Python question here. The question is, what is x << 3 when x is 1 in Python 3? The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 1 to 16, and some others. Hmm, I remember that the << operator is a bitwise shift operator. Let me think about how it works.

Wait, in Python, the left shift operator shifts the bits of the number to the left by a certain number of positions. So, for example, 1 shifted left by 1 would be 2, right? Because 1 in binary is 1, shifting left once gives 10, which is 2.

But wait, wait, what's the base here? Oh, right, in Python, integers are of arbitrary length, so shifting just 1 doesn't change much. So for x << 3, where x is 1, I should compute 1 shifted left by 3 positions.

Let me break it down. The binary form of 1 is 1. Shifting it left by three positions would make it 1000. So in decimal, that's 8. So x << 3 is 8, which would correspond to option C.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh right, in Python, shifting 1 left by 3 gives 8. So the correct answer should be option C: 8.

To determine the value of `x << 3` when `x = 1` in Python, we use the left shift operator `<<`, which shifts the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of positions. Shifting 1 (binary `1`) left by 3 positions results in binary `1000`, which is 8 in decimal. Therefore, the answer is **8**.
