Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about order statistics. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says: We have eight independent observations from a continuous distribution, and we're looking at their order statistics Y1 < Y2 < ... < Y8. The 70th percentile of the distribution is given as π_{0.7} = 27.3. We need to find P(Y7 < 27.3).

Hmm. Order statistics. I remember that order statistics are the values that would be obtained when you sort the data from smallest to largest. So Y1 is the smallest value, Y2 is the next, and so on, up to Y8, the largest.

The 70th percentile means that 70% of the data is less than or equal to 27.3. So 27.3 is the value where 70% of the distribution is below it. Now, the question is about the 7th order statistic, Y7, being less than 27.3.

Wait, so P(Y7 < 27.3) is the probability that the 7th smallest observation is less than 27.3. But wait, the 7th smallest would be the value that is greater than or equal to the 7th and 8th order statistics. So if Y7 is the 7th order statistic, that would mean at least seven of the observations are less than or equal to 27.3.

Wait, no, let me think again. Order statistics are arranged from smallest to largest. So Y1 is the smallest, Y2 is next, etc., up to Y8 being the largest. So Y7 is the 7th smallest. So if Y7 is less than 27.3, that would mean that 7 or more observations are less than 27.3. Because the 7th smallest would be the point where at least seven are below it.

Wait, wait a second. Let me clarify this. In general, for order statistics, P(Y(k) < x) is the probability that at least k of the observations are less than x. So in this case, Y7 is the 7th order statistic. So P(Y7 < x) is the probability that at least seven of the eight observations are less than x.

Wait no, perhaps I'm getting it mixed up. Let me think again. For example, Y1 is the smallest, Y2 the second smallest, etc. So Y7 is the 7th smallest. So if Y7 is less than x, that means that the 7th and all higher order statistics (Y7, Y8) are less than x. So that would imply that at least seven observations are less than x.

Wait, wait, no. Because Y7 is the 7th smallest. So the first seven are less than or equal to Y7. So if Y7 is less than x, that means all seven of the first seven are less than x, and the eighth could be greater or equal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the probability that the 7th order statistic is less than x. That is, P(Y7 < x). For that to happen, at least seven of the eight observations must be less than x. Because if only six are, then the 7th order statistic would be less than or equal to x, but wait no, the 7th would come after six. Hmm, maybe I should think about it as the 7th smallest is the value that, when you order the data, is the 7th one. So if x is 27.3, which is the 70th percentile, then:

If P(Y7 < 27.3) is what we're looking for. So, P(Y7 < 27.3) is the probability that the 7th smallest observation is less than 27.3. That would mean that at least seven of the eight observations are less than 27.3. Because the 7th smallest would be the first one that's above 27.3 if seven are below.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. If all eight were less than 27.3, then all order statistics Y1 to Y8 would be less than 27.3. If exactly seven are less than 27.3, then Y7 would be equal to 27.3, because the 7th smallest would be that value. So, for Y7 to be less than 27.3, that would mean that all seven of the first seven are less than 27.3, and the eighth is greater than or equal to 27.3.

Wait no, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Suppose that seven of the eight observations are less than 27.3, then when you order them, the first seven are the smaller ones, and the last one (the eighth) is the largest. So the 7th order statistic is the largest among the first seven. So if all seven are less than 27.3, then Y7 would also be less than 27.3. So that would be a case where Y7 < 27.3.

Alternatively, if exactly seven are less than 27.3, then Y7 would be 27.3. Because the 7th would be the point where seven are below and one above. So, in that case, Y7 = 27.3, so P(Y7 < 27.3) would be less than 7/8? Or perhaps more precisely, the probability that at least seven of the eight observations are less than 27.3.

Wait, let me rephrase this. For the 7th order statistic to be less than 27.3, it must be that at least seven of the eight observations are less than 27.3. Because if only six or fewer were less than 27.3, then the 7th would have to be 27.3 or higher. Let me think about it with examples.

Case 1: All eight are less than 27.3. Then Y7 is the 7th smallest, which is less than 27.3. So, in this case, P(Y7 <27.3) includes this scenario.

Case 2: Exactly seven are less than 27.3. Then Y7 is the 7th smallest, which is equal to 27.3 because the eighth is the largest and it's greater than or equal to 27.3. So in this case, P(Y7 <27.3) would be less than 1, because Y7 would be 27.3.

Wait no, in this case, Y7 is exactly 27.3. So that would be a point where Y7 is equal to 27.3, not less. So in this case, P(Y7 <27.3) is 0. So in this scenario, the probability is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because if seven are less than 27.3, then the eighth is the largest, so Y8 >=27.3. So the 7th order statistic is the 7th smallest, which would be 27.3 only if all seven are less than 27.3 and the eighth is equal to 27.3. But if all seven are less than 27.3 and the eighth is higher, then Y7 would be less than 27.3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of probability.

P(Y7 <27.3) is the probability that the 7th order statistic is less than 27.3. For that to happen, the 7th smallest must be less than 27.3. That implies that there are at least seven observations less than or equal to 27.3. Because if seven are less than 27.3, then Y7 is the smallest among the seven, which would be less than 27.3. Alternatively, if all eight are less than 27.3, then Y7 is also less than 27.3.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if all eight are less than 27.3, then Y7 is the 7th smallest, which is still less than 27.3. But if exactly seven are less than 27.3, then the 7th would be exactly 27.3 because the eighth is higher, so Y7 >=27.3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the probability that the 7th order statistic is less than x. That is, the probability that at least seven of the eight observations are less than x.

Wait, no, because the 7th order statistic is the smallest of the seven in the first seven. So if seven are less than x, then the 7th order statistic is less than x. If exactly seven are less than x, then the 7th order statistic would be the 7th smallest, which is less than x. Wait, no, if seven are less than x, then the 7th is the smallest among them, which is less than x. So, if seven are less than x, then Y7 (the 7th order statistic) is less than x.

So in that case, the probability that Y7 is less than x is the probability that seven or more of the eight observations are less than x. Because if seven are less than x, then Y7 is the 7th smallest, which would be less than x. If all eight are less than x, then Y7 is also less than x.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the case when seven are less than x and one is greater. Then Y7 is the 7th smallest, which would be less than x, because the first seven are all less than x, and the eighth is greater. So in that case, Y7 would be less than x.

But if six are less than x and two are greater, then Y7 would be the 7th smallest, which would be the first of the seven that are less than x. Wait, no, because in eight observations, if six are less than x, then Y7 would be the 7th smallest. Let's see:

Imagine eight observations: six are less than x, and two are greater. Then the order is: [Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5, Y6] (all less than x), Y7 and Y8 (both greater than x). So Y7 would be the 7th smallest, which is greater than x because Y7 is among the two greater than x. So in this case, Y7 is greater than x.

So if exactly six are less than x, then Y7 is greater than x. So only when seven or more are less than x, Y7 is less than x.

Therefore, P(Y7 < x) = P(at least seven of the eight observations are less than x).

So for our problem, x is 27.3, which is the 70th percentile. So 70% of the distribution is below 27.3. So P(Y7 <27.3) is the probability that at least seven of the eight observations are less than 27.3.

So, we can model this using the binomial distribution. Since each observation is independent and the probability of being less than 27.3 is 0.7, the number of successes (i.e., observations less than 27.3) in eight trials is a binomial random variable with parameters n=8, p=0.7.

So, P(Y7 <27.3) = P(K >=7), where K ~ Binomial(8, 0.7).

Because for each observation, the probability it's less than 27.3 is 0.7. So K is the count of such observations.

So, P(K >=7) = P(K=7) + P(K=8).

Calculating each:

P(K=7) = C(8,7) * (0.7)^7 * (0.3)^1.

C(8,7) is 8.

(0.7)^7 = approximately 0.0823543.

(0.3)^1=0.3.

So 8 * 0.0823543 * 0.3 = 8 * 0.02470629 ≈ 0.19765032.

P(K=8) = C(8,8) * (0.7)^8 * (0.3)^0.

C(8,8)=1.

(0.7)^8≈0.05764801.

So 1 * 0.05764801 * 1 = 0.05764801.

Adding these two together: 0.19765032 + 0.05764801 = 0.25529833.

So approximately 0.2553, which is option C.

So the answer should be option C: 0.2553.
</think>

To determine \( P(Y_7 < 27.3) \), we recognize that \( Y_7 \) is the 7th order statistic of eight observations. \( Y_7 < 27.3 \) implies that at least seven of the observations are less than 27.3. This is modeled using the binomial distribution with parameters \( n = 8 \) and \( p = 0.7 \) (since 70% of the data is less than 27.3). 

We calculate the probability of \( K \geq 7 \), where \( K \) is the number of observations less than 27.3:

\[
P(K \geq 7) = P(K=7) + P(K=8)
\]

\[
P(K=7) = \binom{8}{7} (0.7)^7 (0.3)^1 \approx 8 \cdot 0.0823543 \cdot 0.3 = 0.19765032
\]

\[
P(K=8) = \binom{8}{8} (0.7)^8 (0.3)^0 = 1 \cdot 0.05764801 \cdot 1 = 0.05764801
\]

Adding these:

\[
P(K \geq 7) \approx 0.19765032 + 0.05764801 = 0.25529833
\]

The closest option is **0.2553**.
