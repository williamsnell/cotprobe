Question:

Tired after a long, hard day at school, Cyrus decides to take a nap. An hour later, his Dad wakes him to let him know it's time for dinner. Cyrus feels worse than when he went to bed and can hardly drag himself to the table. An EEG of Cyrus right before he was awoken would most likely have shown a preponderance of

Options:

A: sleep spindles.
B: epsilon waves.
C: theta waves.
D: alpha waves.
E: beta waves.
F: zeta waves.
G: delta waves.
H: lambda waves.
I: mu waves.
J: gamma waves.

Okay, so I have this question about what the EEG of a person who's tired and after a nap would show. Let me try to figure this out. 

First, I remember that electroencephalogram (EEG) measures the electrical activity in the brain. There are different types of waves in the brain, each associated with different brain functions. The question is about the last character in the answer, so I need to pick the correct wave type.

The person is tired and after a nap. When someone is tired, their brain activity tends to be more relaxed and has lower energy. I think that's related to alpha waves. Alpha waves are typically found in the lower frequency range, around 8-12 Hz, and are associated with deep, calm states. They're thought to be linked to relaxation and rest, which fits with the tired state.

So, the EEG would show a preponderance of alpha waves. The other options: beta waves are higher frequency, often associated with attention and thought, zeta and gamma are higher than beta, but they're more for higher brain activity. Theta waves are the ones I'm focusing on. 

Wait, are there any other signals that might be present? The person is tired, which could have some mild signals, but alpha waves are the main ones. So the correct answer should be D: alpha waves.

The correct answer is D: alpha waves. This is because alpha waves are associated with relaxation and rest, which aligns with the person being tired after a nap. 

Answer: D
