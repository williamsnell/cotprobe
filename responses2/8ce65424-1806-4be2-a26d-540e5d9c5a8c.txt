Okay, so I've got this question about x-ray tubes and impurities. Hmm, let me think. The question says that an x-ray tube with a copper target is emitting lines other than those from copper. I remember that when elements are present in the tube, they produce different X-ray emissions, called characteristic X-rays. The K-alpha line is the most intense one emitted by a material, right? So if the tube isn't emitting lines beyond the K-alpha of copper, that suggests some other elements are present.

Wait, the K-alpha of copper is given as 1.5405 Å. The other two K-alpha lines are 0.7092 Å and 1.6578 Å. Wait, but wait, the K-alpha lines for different metals are different. I think copper's K-alpha is around 1.54 Å. So if our sample is emitting lines that are not from copper, perhaps other elements are contributing.

I remember that when you have impurities in the tube, they produce their own K-alpha lines. The K-alpha wavelengths depend on the atomic number of the element. For example, elements with higher atomic numbers have higher K-alpha wavelengths because the binding energy increases.

So let's think about the possible elements. Let me recall the approximate K-alpha wavelengths for various metals. Copper (Z=29) is about 1.54 Å. Zinc (Z=30) is around 1.45 Å, I think. Copper's K-alpha is 1.54, so any element with a higher Z (like Z=31) would have a longer wavelength. For example, iron is Z=26, maybe K-alpha around 1.05 Å? Not sure. Let me think about the periodic table.

Wait, another approach: the K-alpha line for a material is given by the formula: λ = 1.23 × 10^6 Å / √(Z), where Z is the atomic number. Wait, no, is that right? Or was it based on the Compton equation or something else. Alternatively, the general formula for the K-alpha line is λ = 1.236 Å / √(Z) for the first transition. So higher Z means shorter λ.

But wait, that might be an approximation. Alternatively, another source I remember says that the K-alpha line wavelength is approximately λ = 1.23 × 10^6 / √(Z) Å. So let me compute this for some Z values.

For example, Copper (Z=29): √29 ≈ 5.385, so 1.23e6 /5.385 ≈ about 228, 000 Å? Wait, that can't be right because 1.54 Å is much smaller. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is λ = 1.23e6 Å / √Z, where Z is the atomic number. Let me try that.

So for Z=29 (Copper): 1.23e6 / sqrt(29) ≈ 1.23e6 /5.385 ≈ approximately 228,000 Å. That's way too big. Wait, that's not right because I know that copper's K-alpha is around 1.54 Å. So perhaps that formula is incorrect. Maybe I'm mixing up the units or the formula.

Wait, another thought. The K-alpha line is determined by the energy difference between the K (first) and L (second) peaks. The energy levels are determined by the atomic structure. The relation between the wavelength and the atomic number is complex, but perhaps for this problem, it's enough to know that higher Z elements have longer λ.

So, let me think about the given K-alpha lines:

1.5405 Å (copper)
0.7092 Å (maybe Z=31)
1.6578 Å (maybe Z=30 or 29?)

Wait, wait, another approach: the K-alpha lines for metals are known. For example, let me think about the K-alpha lines for the metals:

- Copper: ~1.54 Å
- Zinc: ~1.45 Å
- Iron: ~1.05 Å (but I'm not sure about exact values)
- Silver: around 0.709 Å?
- Platinum: about 0.90 Å?
- Gold: around 1.44 Å (not sure)
- Cobalt: ~1.18 Å
- Nickel: ~1.39 Å
- Tungsten: ~1.41 Å (maybe higher than copper)
- Chromium: ~1.35 Å
- Molybdenum: ~1.025 Å
- Copper is about 1.54, so what about other metals.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the K-alpha lines for other elements. So, for example:

- Gold (Au): Z=79. Using the formula, 1.23e6 / sqrt(79) → sqrt(79)=8.888, so 1.23e6 /8.888 ≈ 137,900 Å. That's way too big; I must have confused the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The K-alpha wavelength is inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic number. So higher Z means shorter λ.

Wait, so let's compute for some elements:

- Z=31: √31≈5.567 → 1.23e6 /5.567 ≈ 221, 000 Å. That's way too big. No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the formula is not correct. Maybe I remember the approximate wavelengths for various metals:

Alternatively, perhaps the K-alpha wavelengths for some metals:

- K Line:

If I remember correctly, the K-alpha lines for some metals are:

- Iron (Fe): 1.0598 Å
- Copper (Cu): 1.5405 Å
- Zinc (Zn): 1.451 Å
- Nickel (Ni): 1.398 Å
- Silver (Ag): 0.7092 Å
- Platinum (Pt): 0.9028 Å
- Gold (Au): 1.441 Å
- Palladium (Pd): 1.097 Å
- Tungsten (W): 0.9960 Å
- Chromium (Cr): 1.342 Å
- Manganese (Mn): 1.433 Å
- Constants (like K for others, like K for others? Not sure.)

Wait, that's a lot. Let me list these:

Let me make a table:

Metal   K_alpha (Å)
Copper: 1.5405
Zinc: 1.451
Silver: 0.7092
Gold: 1.441
Nickel: 1.398
Palladium: 1.097
Tungsten: 0.9960
Chromium: 1.342
Manganese: 1.433
Copper again? Or another constant? Maybe I have some errors.

Wait, so the given data is:

Copper's K-alpha is 1.5405 Å.

Other lines are 0.7092 and 1.6578.

Wait, 1.6578 is longer than copper's, so perhaps another metal is present.

Wait, but 1.6578 is longer than 1.5405? No, wait, 0.7092 is shorter than 1.54. 1.6578 is longer than 1.54, so maybe 1.6578 is from another metal.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the given K-alpha lines again. The question says other lines are due to impurities, so perhaps the other K-alpha lines are from other elements.

So, the first K-alpha line is 1.5405 (copper), and the other two are 0.7092 and 1.6578.

Wait, but the question says that the K-alpha lines other than those from copper are present. Oh wait, perhaps the tube has other elements. So the K-alpha lines from those impurities are 0.7092 and 1.6578.

So, what elements have these K-alpha lines?

Let me list the K-alpha wavelengths for various metals:

- Silver: 0.7092 Å. (Yes, I think Silver has a K-alpha line of about 0.7092 Å.)

- For example, let me see if 1.6578 is another metal. Let's compute the Z for 1.6578.

Using the formula λ = 1.23e6 / √Z → so Z = (1.23e6 / λ)^2.

Wait, for 1.6578 Å:

Z = (1.23e6 / 1.6578e-10) → Wait, no, wait, let me redo this.

Wait, the formula is λ = 1.23e6 / sqrt(Z) → so Z = (1.23e6 / λ)^2.

So for 1.6578 Å, Z = (1.23e6 / 1.6578e-1) )^2 → Wait, no, 1.6578e-10 meters? Oh wait, no, the formula is in Angstroms. So 1.6578e-10 meters is 0.16578 nm or 165.78 Å. Wait, no. Wait, no, 1 Å is 1e-10 m. So 1.6578e-10 m is 16.578e-11 m, which is 16.578 Angstroms. Wait, no, 1e-10 m is 1 angstrom, so 1.6578e-10 m is 16.578e-11 m, which is 1.6578 Angstroms. Oh, no, I see a mistake. The given wavelength is 1.6578 Å, so that's 16.578e-10 meters, which is 16.578 Angstroms. Wait no, wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 1.6578e-10 m is 0.16578 nm. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units here.

Wait, the formula is λ (in Angstroms) = 1.23e6 / sqrt(Z). So if λ is 1.6578 Angstroms, then:

Z = (1.23e6 / 1.6578) )^2.

Wait, let's compute that:

1.23e6 is 1,230,000.

1,230,000 / 1.6578 = approximately 742,000.

Wait, that can't be right because Z is the atomic number, which can't be that high. Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is λ (in Angstroms) = 1.23e6 / sqrt(Z) → so Z = (1.23e6 / λ)^2.

Wait, for λ =1.6578 Angstroms:

Z = (1.23e6 / 1.6578)^2 → 1.23e6 is 1,230,000; 1,230,000 / 1.6578 ≈ 742,000.

Wait, that's way higher than any known metal. So perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Z = (1.23e6 / λ)². So for λ=1.6578 Å:

Z = (1,230,000 /1.6578 )^2 → (742,000)^2 ≈ 5.5e11. Way too high. That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the approximate K-alpha wavelengths for metals again. Let's list some:

- Copper: 1.5405 Å
- Zinc: 1.451 Å
- Silver: 0.7092 Å (as per the question)
- Gold: 1.441 Å
- Nickel: 1.398 Å
- Tungsten: 0.9028 Å
- Iron: 1.0598 Å
- Iron's K alpha is about 1.06 Å.

Wait, so 1.6578 is longer than copper's 1.5405, which doesn't make sense because if that were a K-alpha line, it would have a shorter wavelength. So perhaps that's a typo, but let's proceed.

So, we have K-alpha lines at 0.7092 (Silver) and 1.6578 (if that's a typo, perhaps it's another metal, but I'm not sure). Or perhaps it's another element.

Wait, perhaps let me think: the K-alpha lines from impurities must have wavelengths shorter than those of copper.

No, wait, impurities would emit their own K-alpha lines, which can be longer or shorter than copper's. But wait, wait, the K-alpha line is the most intense line. So if the tube has impurities, their K-alpha lines should be present in the spectrum, but the question says the lines are other than those from copper. So perhaps the impurities have K-alpha lines that are either higher or lower than copper's.

Wait, but when a sample has impurities, the presence of their K-alpha lines can be either higher or lower than the original. For example, if a pure material has a certain K-alpha, impurities can have lines either in the same series (higher or lower).

Alternatively, think about the possible wavelengths. Let's see.

Given the K-alpha lines are:

- Cu: 1.5405 Å
- 0.7092 Å (Silver)
- 1.6578 Å (but I'm not sure about this)

Wait, 1.6578 is longer than copper's, which would suggest that it's a higher energy transition, so maybe a lower Z (since Z and lambda are inversely related). But 1.6578 is longer than Cu's 1.5405, so let me see: if another metal has a K-alpha longer than Cu, that would require a lower Z.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The K-alpha line wavelength is inversely proportional to the square root of the atomic number. So, for the same series (like the K series), a higher Z (higher atomic number) would have a shorter λ.

So if a metal has a higher Z than Cu, its K-alpha would be shorter than Cu's. If a metal has lower Z, its K-alpha would be longer.

But wait, wait—wait, no. The formula is λ = 1.23e6 / sqrt(Z). So higher Z → shorter λ.

So, for example, if Z=31 (like Ga), then λ = 1.23e6 / sqrt(31) ≈ 1.23e6 /5.567 ≈ 221,600 Å. That's way longer than 1.5405, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong, leading to confusion here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is λ = 1.23e6 / (Z^(1/2)). So higher Z would produce a smaller λ. So if a sample has a metal with Z=31 (like Ga), then its K-alpha would be λ=1.23e6/(√31)= about 221,600 Å, which is longer than Cu's 1.5405, which isn't possible because our sample is Cu. So perhaps the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is λ = 1.23e6 / (Z^(1/2)). So for Z=29 (Cu), 1.23e6/sqrt(29)=~1.23e6/5.385≈228,000 Å, which is way larger than Cu's 1.5405. That can't be right.

Wait, that's a problem. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Perhaps the correct formula is λ = 1.23e6 / Z^(1/2). Wait, then for Z=29, λ=1.23e6/5.385≈228,000 Å. That's longer than Cu's, which can't be, because Cu itself has a K-alpha at 1.5405, and impurities would have their own.

This suggests that perhaps the formula is different, or perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is λ = 1.23e6 / (Z^0.5), but that would give longer wavelengths for higher Z, which is opposite to what we want.

Wait, maybe the formula is λ = 1.23e6 Å / Z^(1/2). So for Z=29: 1.23e6 /5.385 ≈ 228,000 Å → longer than Cu's 1.5405. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the formula is λ = 1.23e6 Å / Z^(1/2). So for Cu, λ=1.23e6 / 5.385 ≈ 228,000, which is longer than 1.5405. So if the sample has another element, its K-alpha line would be shorter than Cu's. That would make sense.

So, the impurities' K-alpha lines would be shorter than Cu's, meaning their Z is higher than Cu's (since Z higher → shorter λ).

Wait, but Cu's K-alpha is 1.5405 Å. If another metal has a K-alpha shorter than that, that would imply a higher Z than Cu. But that's impossible because metals with higher Z have higher energy K-alpha, which would lead to shorter wavelengths. So, for example, if there's an element with higher Z (like Z=30), its K-alpha would be shorter than Cu's.

Wait, but wait, if the impurities have a K-alpha line shorter than Cu's, that would suggest that their Z is higher than Cu's. So for example, if an element has Z=30, its K-alpha would be shorter than Cu's.

So, what's a K-alpha line shorter than Cu's? Let's think of elements with higher Z than Cu, but whose K-alpha is shorter than Cu's. That would imply that the element is present in the sample. 

But wait, in reality, most impurities present in x-ray spectra have K-alpha lines in the same series as the sample but with higher or lower energy (which depends on their position in the series). For example, when a metal is present, impurities with same group (like same series) would have their K-alpha lines in the same series but higher or lower energy. However, for the K series (the first transition), the K-alpha lines are more closely grouped, and impurities would have their own lines in the same series.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible K-alpha wavelengths.

Given that, let's think about the impurities.

The given data is:

- Cu: 1.5405 Å
- One K-alpha line: 0.7092 Å → Silver (Ag)
- Another K-alpha line: 1.6578 Å → Hmm, that's longer than Cu's 1.5405. So this can't be a K-alpha line of Copper, but perhaps of another metal.

Wait, but if this impurity's K-alpha line is longer than Cu's, that would imply that its Z is lower than Cu's, because Z higher would mean shorter λ.

Wait, but if the impurity's K-alpha line is longer, that would mean Z is lower. So perhaps the impurity is a metal with lower Z but a longer K-alpha.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong and the impurity's K-alpha is in the same series as the sample but with higher Z.

Wait, perhaps the impurity has a K-alpha line longer than the sample's. So, for example, if a sample has Cu, and impurities include a higher Z metal, then their K-alpha lines would have a shorter wavelength. But in this case, the impurity's K-alpha is longer than Cu's. That suggests that the impurity is a metal with a higher Z than Cu, which would have a K-alpha shorter than Cu's. But that's not happening. So maybe this is a mistake in the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the impurity has a K-alpha line in the same series as Cu but with a longer wavelength. For example, perhaps the impurity is a higher Z metal, so their K-alpha would be shorter than Cu's, but the question says it's longer than Cu's. So this is conflicting. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the impurities have K-alpha lines that are in the same series as the sample but with longer wavelengths. For example, if a sample has Cu (1.5405 Å), impurities may include higher Z metals, which have shorter K-alpha. But the question states the K-alpha lines are longer than Cu's, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the impurities are lower-Z metals, so their K-alpha lines are longer than Cu's. Because lower-Z would have a longer λ.

Yes! That makes sense.

So, if the impurities have K-alpha lines longer than Cu's, that suggests their Z is lower than Cu's (since Z lower → lambda longer).

So, given that, the impurities must have lower Z than Cu, which would result in their K-alpha lines being longer than Cu's.

So, in the given data, the impurity K-alpha lines are 0.7092 (Silver) and 1.6578 (which is longer than Cu's 1.5405).

So, let's see: 

- Silver (Ag) has a K-alpha line at 0.7092 Å.

- What about 1.6578 Å? That's longer than Cu's, which would imply that this impurity is a metal with a lower Z than Cu. Because lower Z → longer λ.

Wait, but is there any metal with lower Z than Cu (Z=29) that has a K-alpha longer than Cu's? Let me think.

Wait, no. Because higher Z would have a shorter λ, and lower Z would have a longer λ. So for a metal with Z lower than Cu, its K-alpha would be longer than Cu's.

For example, Z=28 would have a K-alpha longer than Cu's, right?

But wait, let's think about the approximate K-alpha wavelengths.

Wait, another approach: let's list all the possible K-alpha lines in the K series, and see which ones could fit.

The K series includes transitions with the same n (like the K transition in the X-ray tube). For a sample, the K series would have lines corresponding to the same n but different Z.

So, the K-alpha line of a sample is determined by the same n but a different Z. The formula for the K-alpha line wavelength is:

λ = (1.23e6 Å) / (Z^(1/2)).

So, the K-alpha line of a sample is longer for lower Z and shorter for higher Z.

So, if a sample is Cu (Z=29), its K-alpha line is 1.5405 Å.

If another metal has a K-alpha line longer than 1.5405, it must have a lower Z.

For example, let's find a metal with Z=28.

λ = 1.23e6 / sqrt(28) ≈ 1.23e6 / 5.2915 ≈ 2.33e5 Å. Wait, that's 233,000 Å, which is longer than 154,000 Å, which is 1.54e5. Wait, no, 1.23e6 is 1,230,000 Å. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the formula is λ = 1.23e6 / (Z^0.5). So for Z=29, λ=1.23e6 /5.385≈ 228,000 Å. So that's longer than 154,000 Å (Cu's K-alpha). So, for a lower Z, the K-alpha is longer.

So, to have a K-alpha longer than Cu's (1.54e5 Å), the metal must have Z < 29.

So, let's see if the impurities have Z < 29.

Looking at the given data, one of the impurities is Silver (Ag), Z=47 → which is higher than 29 → so its K-alpha is shorter. So that's not the impurity.

Wait, but the question says that the impurities have K-alpha lines at 0.7092 and 1.6578. So, the 0.7092 is Silver (Z=47). So that's not an impurity. The other is 1.6578 Å.

Wait, perhaps 1.6578 is a typo. Let me check some metals.

Wait, for example, let's see if any metal has a K-alpha line of about 1.66 Å.

Wait, let me think about the approximate K-alpha wavelengths again. What about for other metals.

Wait, let me think of the K-alpha line of another metal, say, for example, Silver (Ag) is 0.7092 Å, as given. So, the other impurity must have a K-alpha line longer than 1.5405 Å, but shorter than 1.6578? Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the impurity with K-alpha 1.6578 is a higher Z metal, which would have a shorter wavelength. But in that case, 1.6578 is shorter than Cu's 1.5405, which would imply higher Z than Cu, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps that's a mistake, and the correct value is shorter than 1.5405. For example, maybe 1.6578 is a typo for 1.451 (Zn), but that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the impurity's K-alpha line is longer than the sample's, but that's not possible because higher Z would have shorter λ. So perhaps the given data is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the given K-alpha lines are 0.7092 (Ag) and 1.6578 (another metal). But wait, 1.6578 is longer than Cu's. So, the other metal must have a lower Z, which would mean its K-alpha is longer than Cu's.

Wait, but 1.6578 is longer than Cu's. So that would imply that the other metal has a lower Z than Cu. So, for example, consider a metal with Z=28.

λ=1.23e6 / sqrt(28) ≈ 1.23e6 /5.2915 ≈ 2.33e5 Å → which is 233,000 Å, which is longer than 154,000 Å. So, that's not matching. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is λ = 1.23e6 Å * Z^(-1/2). So, for Z=29, λ=1.23e6 / sqrt(29) ≈ 1.23e6 / 5.385 ≈ 228,000 Å. Which is longer than 154,000 Å (Cu's), which can't be correct. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the options given.

The question says that the last tube's tube is missing, but the question is about which impurities are present.

The options are: A) Zinc and Chromium; B) Copper and Silver; C) Chromium and Manganese; D) Iron and Nickel.

Wait, but the impurities present are Silver (Ag) and another metal with K-alpha longer than Cu's. Wait, but 1.6578 is longer than Cu's, which can't be, unless it's a higher Z metal.

Wait, perhaps the impurity's K-alpha is 1.6578, which is longer than Cu's, which would imply that the impurity is a higher Z metal. But higher Z would have shorter λ, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the impurities have K-alpha lines that are longer than the pure element's K-alpha line, which would imply that they have a lower Z, hence their λ is longer.

So, in this case, the impurities must have a lower Z than Cu, so their K-alpha is longer than Cu's.

But looking at the options, let's see if any of them have lower Z than Cu.

Looking at the options:

A) Zinc (Zn=30) and Chromium (Cr=24) → Zinc has higher Z than Cu, so its K-alpha would be shorter than Cu's.

B) Copper and Silver (Ag) → Silver is higher Z than Cu, so its K-alpha is shorter.

C) Chromium (Cr=24) and Manganese (Mn=25) → Both have lower Z than Cu. So their K-alpha lines would be longer than Cu's.

D) Iron (Fe=26) and Nickel (Ni=28) → Both have lower Z than Cu. So their K-alpha lines would be longer than Cu's.

So, the impurities present have K-alpha lines longer than Cu's, which implies that their Z is lower than Cu's.

So, looking at the options, both C and D have lower Z than Cu, so their K-alpha lines are longer.

But the question says that the impurities have two K-alpha lines: 0.7092 and 1.6578. So, 0.7092 is Ag (Z=47), which is higher than Cu's Z=29, so its K-alpha is shorter. So the other K-alpha line, 1.6578, must be from a metal with lower Z than Cu.

So, from the options, the correct pair is one where one is a lower Z than Cu, and the other is higher. But since option C and D are both lower Z than Cu, but have different metals, perhaps the correct answer is option B or C or D.

Wait, but in the question, the impurities have K-alpha lines at 0.7092 and 1.6578. So, the 1.6578 must be a metal with lower Z than Cu. So, which metals are in the options with lower Z than Cu?

Option C: Cr (24) and Mn (25). Both have lower Z than Cu (29). Option D: Fe (26) and Ni (28) → both lower. So both are possible.

But wait, the impurities have K-alpha lines at 0.7092 and 1.6578. So, 0.7092 is Ag (Z=47), higher than Cu, so its K-alpha is shorter. So, the other impurity must be a metal with lower Z than Cu, which has K-alpha longer.

So, from the options, the correct pair must include a metal with lower Z than Cu and another with higher.

Looking at the options:

A) Zinc (30) and Chromium (24). Zinc is higher Z than Cu, so its K-alpha is shorter. Chromium is lower Z than Cu, so its K-alpha is longer. So, this pair fits.

But wait, the question says that the impurities have K-alpha lines at 0.7092 and 1.6578. So, 0.7092 is Ag (Z=47) → higher Z, K-alpha shorter. 1.6578 → must be a metal with lower Z than Cu.

So, which option has a metal with lower Z than Cu, and another with higher Z than Cu?

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Zinc (30) and Chromium (24). Zinc is higher than Cu, so its K-alpha is shorter. Chromium is lower than Cu, so its K-alpha is longer. So this pair would have K-alpha lines at shorter and longer, which matches our impurities.

Option B: Copper and Silver. Silver is higher Z, so K-alpha shorter. Copper's K-alpha is longer, so this doesn't match.

Option C: Cr (24) and Mn (25). Both lower than Cu. So their K-alpha lines would be longer than Cu's, which matches the impurities. But the impurities have 0.7092, which is Ag, not Cr. So this option would not fit.

Option D: Fe (26) and Ni (28). Both lower than Cu. So their K-alpha would be longer than Cu's. But the impurities have 0.7092 (Ag), which is higher than Cu, so this would not fit.

Wait, but the impurities have a K-alpha line at 0.7092 (Ag) and 1.6578. So, 0.7092 is Ag, which must be a metal with higher Z than Cu, which is not the case. Because Cu's K-alpha is 1.5405, which is longer than Ag's 0.7092. So, Ag's K-alpha is shorter than Cu's. Thus, this impurity must be a metal with lower Z than Cu.

So, the impurities have K-alpha lines at 0.7092 and 1.6578. 0.7092 is Ag, which is higher Z than Cu, so its K-alpha is shorter. 1.6578 must be a metal with lower Z than Cu, so its K-alpha is longer.

So, which option has a metal with lower Z than Cu and another with higher Z than Cu?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Zinc (30) and Chromium (24). Zinc is higher than Cu, so K-alpha is shorter. Chromium is lower than Cu, so K-alpha is longer. So this pair would have K-alpha lines shorter and longer, which matches our impurities.

Option B: Copper and Silver. Silver is higher than Cu, so K-alpha shorter. Copper's longer. Doesn't match.

Option C: Cr (24) and Mn (25). Both lower than Cu. So their K-alpha lines are longer than Cu's. But impurities have 0.7092, which is Ag, so this option doesn't fit.

Option D: Fe (26) and Ni (28). Both lower than Cu. So their K-alpha lines are longer than Cu's. Again, impurities have Ag, not Fe.

So, the correct pair is option A: Zinc and Chromium. Because their K-alpha lines are 0.7092 (Zinc) and 1.6578 (Chromium). So, zinc has higher Z than Cu, so its K-alpha is shorter. Chromium has lower Z than Cu, so its K-alpha is longer. This fits the impurity's K-alpha lines.

But wait, the impurities have K-alpha lines at 0.7092 and 1.6578. So, 0.7092 is Ag, which is higher than Cu's Z=29, so its K-alpha is shorter. 1.6578 must be a metal with lower Z than Cu, so its K-alpha is longer.

So, the option with a metal that has lower Z than Cu and another with higher Z than Cu would be the correct one.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Zinc (30) and Chromium (24). Zinc is higher than Cu, so K-alpha shorter. Chromium is lower than Cu, so K-alpha longer. This fits.

But wait, the impurities have K-alpha lines 0.7092 and 1.6578. So, 0.7092 is Ag, which is higher than Cu, so K-alpha shorter. 1.6578 is a metal with lower Z than Cu, so K-alpha longer. So the correct option is option A: Zinc and Chromium.

But wait, looking at the possible options, do any pairs include a metal with lower Z than Cu and another with higher Z than Cu?

Yes, option A includes Cr (24) which is lower than Cu (29), and Zn (30) which is higher than Cu.

So, the correct option is A.
</think>

The impurities present in the sample have K-alpha lines at 0.7092 Å (Silver) and 1.6578 Å (a metal with lower Z than Cu). Since 0.7092 Å corresponds to Silver (Ag), which has a higher Z (47) than Cu (29), its K-alpha line is shorter. Therefore, the other K-alpha line, 1.6578 Å, corresponds to a metal with a lower Z than Cu, and its K-alpha line is longer than Cu's. 

Among the options provided, the pair that includes a metal with lower Z than Cu and another with higher Z than Cu is:

**A) Zinc and Chromium**

- Zinc (Zn, 30) has a higher Z than Cu (29), so its K-alpha line is shorter.
- Chromium (Cr, 24) has a lower Z than Cu (29), so its K-alpha line is longer.

This pair fits the observed K-alpha lines of the impurities.
