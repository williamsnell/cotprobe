Question:

A farmer purchased a new pickup truck from a local automobile dealership. A few weeks later, the farmer was using the truck to haul a load of supplies to his farm. As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.
B: Yes, if the manufacturing company had issued a recall for the defect.
C: No, if the farmer was speeding and therefore could not stop in time.
D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.
E: No, if the pedestrian was crossing the street illegally.
F: No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.
G: Yes, if the auto dealer was aware of the defect but did not inform the farmer.
H: No, because the farmer should have had the truck inspected before using it for heavy duty work.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this negligence question. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is a farmer buys a new pickup truck. He drives down a hill towards an intersection. The brakes failed, the truck didn't slow down. He couldn't stop, so he saw a pedestrian crossing the street. He tried to steer around but couldn't. The truck struck the pedestrian, seriously injuring him. The pedestrian is suing the auto dealership for negligence. The question is whether the dealership will prevail. It's given that the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect in the car.

So the key points are: the defect was in the car, which led to the truck's failure. The farmer tried to use the truck for heavy duty work, but the truck failed to slow down. He couldn't stop, so saw pedestrian.

Now, the question is about negligence. So the dealership is suing for negligence. I need to determine if the plaintiff can win.

Option A says no because the pedestrian wasn't a purchaser or user. Wait, the truck was purchased by the farmer, so the truck is a user. If the truck was used for heavy duty, that's a duty. If the truck failed to slow down, that's a breach of duty. But the problem is the failure was due to a defect in the car, not the truck. So even though the truck was used for heavy duty, the defect in the car is the cause. So the failure itself isn't negligence from the car's defect. The truck is the one that failed to stop. So the failure was caused by the car's defect. But the car's defect was in the car, not the truck. So maybe the assumption is that the truck's failure is the cause of negligence. So if the truck was used as a heavy duty, which requires stopping, then failure to stop is negligence.

But the question is whether the negligence claim can be made by the dealership. The question is about the manufacturer's liability.

So the issue is whether the failure of the truck is a defect in the car that the manufacturer can be held responsible for. Because the truck was purchased, the manufacturer is responsible for the truck's condition. If the truck failed to stop, that's a defect in the truck itself. But the question says the failure was because of a manufacturing defect in the car. That might mean that the truck's failure is not a defect in the truck but in the car. So the failure isn't a defect in the truck, so the dealership's liability for the truck's failure is questionable.

Wait, but the question states the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect in the car. So the truck itself doesn't have that defect. So the truck's failure is a failure to stop, which is a defect in the truck, but the truck's manufacturer is responsible for the truck's condition. So if the truck's failure is due to a defect in the car, then the manufacturer is not liable for the truck's failure because the defect is in the car, not the truck.

Alternatively, maybe the implications of the car defect extend to the truck. If the car had a defect that could lead to the truck failing, then the manufacturer might be liable. But that's a stretch. Typically, the manufacturer is responsible for the truck as it was purchased, not the car.

So the failure was a defect in the truck, not the car. So the dealership can't be held responsible for the truck's failure because the defect was in the car. Therefore, the failure isn't a defect in the truck, so the negligence claim isn't valid. So the answer would be option A, which says no because the pedestrian wasn't a purchaser or user. Wait, the pedestrian was a user of the truck, so that's a user. So if the failure was due to the car's defect, the truck's failure isn't a defect in the truck, so the failure isn't a defect in the truck, so the dealership isn't liable. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but what about the auto dealership's liability? The auto dealership is the seller of the truck. If the truck's defect is in the manufacturer, then the manufacturer isn't liable. So the question is whether the manufacturer can be held responsible for the truck's failure. The problem is, the failure was caused by a defect in the car, so the truck isn't a product of that defect. So the failure isn't a defect of the truck, so the manufacturer isn't liable.

Alternatively, maybe the manufacturer can be held responsible for the truck's failure because the truck was purchased and is a user. But that's not the case. The manufacturer is responsible for the truck's condition, not the car's. So the failure isn't a defect of the truck, so the dealership can't be liable for the truck's failure.

So the first part of the answer would be that the truck's failure isn't a defect in the truck, so the seller can't be held responsible for the truck's failure. So the plaintiff can't win, so the dealership won't prevail. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but another angle: maybe the manufacturer could be liable if the defect was known by the dealer. If the dealer discovered the defect and informed the customer, then the dealer is liable because they have reasonable knowledge and could have known. But in this case, the question states that it's conclusively proven that the brake failure was due to a defect in the car. So the dealer didn't have the defect, and the failure wasn't the result of the dealer's fault. So the dealer can't be held responsible for the truck's failure because the defect is in the car, not the truck.

So the key point is that the failure was a defect in the truck, but the manufacturer is responsible for the truck's condition. So the failure isn't a defect of the truck, so the dealership isn't liable. So the answer would be option A: No, because the pedestrian wasn't a purchaser or user.

Wait, the question is whether the pedestrian is a purchaser or user. The pedestrian is a user of the truck. So the answer is A because the failure isn't a defect in the truck, so the seller isn't liable. So the answer is A.

The question revolves around whether the auto dealership will prevail in a negligence claim against the injured pedestrian. The key points are:

1. **Failure of the Truck**: The farmer's truck failed to stop due to a manufacturing defect in the car, not the truck itself.
2. **Negligence and Liability**: The failure to stop is a defect in the truck, not the car. Therefore, the manufacturer is not liable for the truck's failure.
3. **Purchaser/User Status**: The pedestrian was a user of the truck, so the manufacturer's liability for the truck's failure does not apply.
4. **Answer Analysis**: 
   - **Option A**: Correct. The failure is a defect in the truck, not the car, and the manufacturer is not liable. The pedestrian wasn't a purchaser or user in this context.
   - **Options B, C, D, E, F, G, H**: Incorrect for reasons related to the reasoning above.
   - **Option A** holds because the failure is a defect in the truck, not the car, and the manufacturer isn't liable for the truck's failure.
