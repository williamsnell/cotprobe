Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The problem says that a number x equals 2 to the power of 15 multiplied by 3 to the power of 6. And the question is, what number's cube equals x? The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I think I need to find a number y such that when I cube it (y cubed), I get x. So y^3 = x. Since x is given as 2^15 * 3^6, I should probably express this in terms of exponents to see what y would be.

Wait, I remember that when you take a cube root, it's like dividing the exponents by 3. Because cube root of a number is the same as raising it to the power of 1/3. So if y^3 = x, then y = x^(1/3). Let me apply that to x.

So x is 2^15 * 3^6. Taking the cube root would mean each exponent is divided by 3. So for the 2^15 term, 15 divided by 3 is 5. And for 3^6, 6 divided by 3 is 2. So y would be 2^5 multiplied by 3^2.

Calculating those exponents: 2^5 is 32, and 3^2 is 9. So 32 * 9 is 288. Let me check the options. Looking at the choices, J is 288. So the answer should be J.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify: 288 cubed should equal x. Let me compute 288^3. But wait, maybe I don't need to compute the entire number because the options are given. Alternatively, since y is 2^5 * 3^2, and y^3 is (2^5)^3 * (3^2)^3 = 2^15 * 3^6, which is indeed x. So yes, y is 288. So the correct option is J.

The correct answer is J: 288.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Given \( x = 2^{15} \times 3^6 \).

2. We need to find a number \( y \) such that \( y^3 = x \).

3. Express \( y \) as \( y = x^{1/3} \).

4. Substitute \( x \): \( y = (2^{15} \times 3^6)^{1/3} \).

5. Apply exponent rules: \( y = 2^{15/3} \times 3^{6/3} = 2^5 \times 3^2 \).

6. Calculate: \( 2^5 = 32 \), \( 3^2 = 9 \).

7. Multiply: \( 32 \times 9 = 288 \).

8. Verify that \( 288^3 = x \), which it does.

**Answer:** J: 288
