The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East–West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective—a new world order—can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.
—President George Herbert Walker Bush, Speech to a Joint Session of Congress, September 11, 1990
President Bush's "new world order" most directly resembles which of the following?

Options:

A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points
B: The Truman Doctrine
C: The Monroe Doctrine
D: Theodore Roosevelt's "Big Stick"
E: The Marshall Plan
F: The Roosevelt Corollary
G: The Domino Theory
H: Containment policy toward the Soviet Union
I: Richard Nixon's "Peace with Honor"

Answer:

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a historical event and which policy it resembles. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that President George Herbert Walker Bush made a speech to Congress in 1990 about a new world order. The speech was about ending east-west confrontation as a way to counter aggression, starting a new partnership among nations. He mentions the crisis in the Persian Gulf as a rare opportunity for cooperation. The new world order is described as having more freedom from terror, a stronger pursuit of justice, and a secure future for peace.

The options are various world history policies or concepts. I need to match this to one of the listed options.

Let me list the options again:

A: Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points
B: The Truman Doctrine
C: The Monroe Doctrine
D: Theodore Roosevelt's "Big Stick"
E: The Marshall Plan
F: The Roosevelt Corollary
G: The Domino Theory
H: Containment policy toward the Soviet Union
I: Richard Nixon's "Peace with Honor"

I remember that the Monroe Doctrine was a statement by the United States that the US government cannot interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, especially the Gulf states. This was a response to the Persian Gulf crisis, which Bush referred to as a "crisis of opportunity." The Monroe Doctrine is a key part of international relations theory, advising against US intervention in other countries' internal affairs.

The other options: Wilson's Fourteen Points were a set of international agreements he proposed in the early 20th century, aimed at reducing world poverty and inequality. The Big Stick was a policy from the 1940s aimed at stopping the Soviet Union's expansion. The Marshall Plan was a major international program in the late 20th century for dealing with the Cold War, involving the US and other nations. The Domino Theory was an idea that suggested a chain reaction caused by the fall of the Soviet Union, leading to the collapse of the US and others. The Roosevelt Corollary was part of the New Deal, focusing on economic recovery. The containment policy, like the US's approach to the Soviet Union, was part of the Marshall Plan.

So, the speech mentioned the Monroe Doctrine as a response to the Persian Gulf crisis. That makes sense because the Monroe Doctrine was Bush's criticism of US intervention, which was a significant part of the crisis that led to the new partnership. The other options don't fit as well. For example, the Big Stick was about stopping the Soviet expansion, but that's more about the Cold War response, not necessarily the current crisis. The Marshall Plan was for the post-WWII response to the Cold War. The US's approach to the Soviet Union wasn't exactly a policy but a strategy part of the Marshall Plan.

So the correct answer should be C: The Monroe Doctrine.
</think>

The correct answer is C: The Monroe Doctrine.

**Explanation:**
The Monroe Doctrine, proposed by the United States, states that the US government is not allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, particularly the Gulf states. This was a direct response to the Persian Gulf crisis mentioned in George Herbert Walker Bush's 1990 speech, highlighting the importance of cooperation and avoiding intervention. The other options refer to different historical strategies, such as the Big Stick, Marshall Plan, or containment policies, none of which align as closely with the context of the speech.
