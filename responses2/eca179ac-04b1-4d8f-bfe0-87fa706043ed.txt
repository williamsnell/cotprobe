Okay, so I have this question about ice hockey and penalties. The question is asking which of the listed options is not a penalty. The options are A through J, with each being a different term.

I remember from my hockey training that there are a few common penalties in ice hockey. First, I think about the most basic ones. I remember that a player can get a penalty if they hit the puck in front of the net, which is called a "puck-handling" mistake. I think that's option J. Or maybe it's another term? Hmm.

Then I recall that a player might get a "hooking" penalty. Hooking is when a player hits the puck with their hook, which is when they hit it at a 45-degree angle. That's option H. So H is a penalty.

Another term I think about is a "charging" penalty, which is hitting the puck behind the net, so that's option B. So B is a penalty.

Wait, what about "cross-passing"? I'm not sure. I think cross-passing might not be a penalty at all, but I'm not certain. I might need to think more about that. Alternatively, maybe cross-passing is a skill rather than a penalty.

Let me think about the others. "Burttending" is a term I've heard before. I think that's when a player hits the puck in front of the net, which is a penalty. So that's J again. So J is a penalty.

"Sliding" might refer to hitting the puck behind the net, which is charging, so B is a penalty.

"Capracepsis" isn't one of the options here, so I can probably ignore that. 

" butt-ending" — I'm not sure if that's a penalty. Maybe it's when a player hits the puck behind the net, which would be charging. So maybe it's a penalty. Or perhaps it's a different term. I'm a bit confused here.

"Stuck" isn't an option, so that's not relevant.

"Skating" is a broad term that's not a specific penalty. So I can probably ignore that.

"Hooking" is definitely a penalty, so H is a penalty.

"Puck-handling" is a penalty, so J is a penalty.

"Shooting" isn't one of the options, so no.

Wait, the question is which is not a penalty. So I need to find the one that isn't a penalty.

Let me list each option:

A: cross-passing — I think this isn't a penalty. Because cross-passing is more about the player's movement, not hitting the puck in front.

B: charging — definitely a penalty.

C: carving — maybe not a penalty. I think carving is when you hit the puck behind the net, which is charging. So C is a penalty.

D: butt-ending — perhaps hitting behind the net, which is charging, so D is a penalty.

E: stick-checking — I think that's when the puck is hit to the side, which is a penalty, so E is a penalty.

F: goal-tending — hitting the puck toward the goal, which is a penalty, so F is a penalty.

G: sliding — hitting behind the net, which is charging, so G is a penalty.

I: skating — no, not a penalty.

J: puck-handling — yes, hitting in front, penalty.

So now looking at the options:

A is cross-passing — not a penalty.

B is charging — penalty.

C is carving — which is hitting behind net, charge. So C is penalty.

D is butt-ending, hit behind net, so D is penalty.

E is stick-checking, hit to side, penalty.

F is goal-tending, hit toward goal, penalty.

G is sliding, hit behind net, penalty.

H is hooking, penalty.

J is puck-handling, penalty.

So the options A, I, and E are not penalties. Wait, no, option I is skating, which is not a penalty. But perhaps I need to check the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are A through J, and the question is which is not a penalty. So the non-penalty would be any of them that does not involve hitting the puck in front.

So the non-penalty options are A, I, and E. Wait, no, the question is asking which is not a penalty. So the ones that are not penalties would be A, I, E. But the question is multiple-choice, so the options are single letters, but the answer is supposed to be one letter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are:

A: cross-passing — not a penalty.

I: skating — not a penalty.

E: stick-checking — a penalty.

Wait, no, stick-checking is a penalty because it's hitting the puck to the side. So E is a penalty.

So the non-penalty options are A, I, and E.

Wait, but the question is asking which is not a penalty. So the answer is any of those that is not a penalty.

But the options are single letters, so I'm probably supposed to pick one, but that can't be right because multiple options are correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is which of the options is not a penalty. So the correct answer would be the one that's not a penalty.

Looking back, which of the given options is not a penalty.

Wait, perhaps the options are:

A: cross-passing — not a penalty.

B: charging — penalty.

C: carving — charge, penalty.

D: butt-ending — charge, penalty.

E: stick-checking — charge, penalty.

F: goal-tending — charge, penalty.

G: sliding — charge, penalty.

H: hooking — penalty.

J: puck-handling — penalty.

So the only one that's not a penalty is A, I, and E. But the question is asking which is not a penalty, implying one option.

Wait, but the options are listed as A through J, each being a possible answer. So the correct answer is which one is not a penalty. So all except one are penalties.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again.

Cross-passing — I think that's allowed, it's more about the player's movement. So no, it's not a penalty.

Skating — not a penalty.

Stick-checking — a penalty.

So the options that are not penalties are A, I, and E.

But the question is asking which is not a penalty. So the correct answer is any of A, I, E. But the options are presented as individual letters, and the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Wait, but perhaps in the question, the options are the possible answers (A-J), and the correct answer is one of them. So the question is, which of the options is not a penalty.

So all the options except one are penalties. So which one is not?

Looking at the list:

A: cross-passing — not a penalty.

I: skating — not a penalty.

E: stick-checking — a penalty.

So A and I are not penalties. So I'm confused because the question is multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with my earlier analysis. Let me double-check each option.

Let me think about each penalty:

- Charging is when you hit behind the net (B is a penalty).

- Carving is hitting behind net (C is a penalty).

- Stick-checking is hitting to the side (E is a penalty).

- Hooking is hitting at a 45-degree angle (H is a penalty).

- Puck-handling is hitting in front (J is a penalty).

-滑动 (sliding) is hitting behind net (G is a penalty).

-滑动 — same as G.

- Carve — C is charge.

- Butt-ending — hitting behind net, so charge.

- Cross-passing — not a penalty.

- skating — not a penalty.

- goal-tending — charge.

So the only non-penalty would be cross-passing (A) and skating (I). But the options are given as single letters.

Wait, but the question is: which of the following is not a penalty? So the answer must be one of them, but the options are individual letters, so perhaps the intended answer is A, I, or E.

Wait, but the options are all single letters. So perhaps the correct answer is cross-passing (A), skating (I), or stick-checking (E). But the question is which is not a penalty, so all except one are penalties.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in considering if skating is a penalty. Let me think again.

Is skating considered a penalty? Or is it just a skill? Hmm, skating is a skill, but not a specific penalty. Wait, in ice hockey, when a player skates, it's part of their movement, not a penalty. So skating is not a penalty.

Wait, but in the options, skating is I. So that's not a penalty. So A and I are not penalties.

But the question is which is not a penalty, implying one option is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps cross-passing is a penalty? Or is it not?

Wait, I think cross-passing is not a penalty. It's a skill, not a specific action. So cross-passing (A) would not be a penalty.

But earlier, I thought cross-passing is not a penalty. So the options are A, I, and E as non-penalties.

But the question is asking which is NOT a penalty, so all except one are penalties. So the answer would be the option that is not a penalty. So looking for the one that is not a penalty.

So the options are:

A: cross-passing — not a penalty.

I: skating — not a penalty.

E: stick-checking — penalty.

So both A and I are not penalties. Hmm, but the question is a multiple-choice; perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the question again: "which of the following is not a penalty?"

Looking at each option:

A: cross-passing — Is this a penalty? I think it's not. Because it's more about the movement, not the specific action of hitting the puck.

B: charging — yes, penalty.

C: carving — yes, penalty.

D: butt-ending — yes, penalty.

E: stick-checking — yes, penalty.

F: goal-tending — yes, penalty.

G: sliding — yes, penalty.

H: hooking — yes, penalty.

J: puck-handling — yes, penalty.

So the only options that are not penalties are A and I.

But the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe there's another way to think about it.

Wait, perhaps cross-passing is a penalty. I thought it wasn't. Let me confirm.

Yes, cross-passing is when a player passes the puck in front of the net, which is a penalty. So cross-passing (A) is a penalty.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. So I must have made a mistake earlier. So cross-passing is a penalty, so A is a penalty.

Wait, then the options that are not penalties would be I: skating. Because skating is not a penalty.

So the non-penalty options are I.

Wait, but then in the options, I: skating — is that a penalty? Or is it not?

Hmm, well, skating is a movement, not a specific penalty. So it's not a penalty. So I is not a penalty.

So the answer would be I, skating.

Wait, but I'm now confused because earlier I thought cross-passing was a penalty, but now I'm rethinking.

Wait, perhaps another approach: in ice hockey, which are penalties and which are not.

Puck-handling (J) — yes, hitting in front is a penalty.

Cross-passing (A) — hitting in front is a penalty.

So these are penalties.

So the options that are not penalties are:

B: charging — penalty.

C: carving — charge, penalty.

D: butt-ending — charge, penalty.

E: stick-checking — charge, penalty.

F: goal-tending — charge, penalty.

G: sliding — charge, penalty.

H: hooking — penalty.

I: skating — not a penalty.

J: puck-handling — penalty.

So the only option that's not a penalty is I: skating.

Wait, but when I first thought, I thought cross-passing wasn't a penalty, but upon rethinking, it is.

So the correct answer is I: skating.

But wait, in the initial analysis, I thought cross-passing was a penalty. But upon further consideration, perhaps it's not. So the answer would be skating (I) as not a penalty.
