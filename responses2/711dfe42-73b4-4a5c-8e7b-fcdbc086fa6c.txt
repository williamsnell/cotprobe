Okay, so I've got this question about anatomical structures and homologs. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is asking which of the listed structures is homologous to a bird's wing. I remember that homologous structures are similar in structure but evolved independently, usually in different species. So, the wings of birds and similar animals would share similar structures.

Looking at the options, each option is a different animal's body part. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Flipper of a cetacean. Acetacean is another group that includes birds and some other marine animals like whales. The flipper is similar to a bird's wing but in the marine realm. So, maybe this is relevant, but are they homologous? I think flipper is a similar structure, so maybe.

Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Antennae are part of the butterfly's body, not their wings. So this doesn't make sense. They're not wings but part of the body. So probably not the answer.

Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Oh wait, that's exactly what the question is about. The wing of a butterfly is homologous to a bird's wing. So C seems correct. But wait, let me check the others to make sure.

Option D: Hindlimb of an elephant. Elephants have a hindlimb, which is part of their body, not a wing. So no, not this one.

Option E: Forelimb of a crocodile. Forelimb is part of the crocodile's body, so no.

Option F: Dorsal fin of a shark. Sharks have fins and fins are part of their body structure, not wings.

Option G: Shell of a turtle. Turtle shells are protective and not related to wings.

Option H: Horn of a rhinoceros. Horns are part of the animal's mouth and not wings.

Option I: Hindlimb of a kangaroo. Kangaroos have hindlimbs, but again, not wings.

Option J: Tail of a beaver. Beavers have tails, but not wings.

So, the only one that directly relates to wings is the butterfly's wing, which is option C. But wait, wait a secondâ€”wait, the question is about homologous structures. The wings of birds are similar structures to the wings of other birds. So, the wings of an animal are homologous to the wings of another species. So, the correct answer is the option that is a similar structure to a bird's wings. So, the butterfly's wings are homologous to the bird's wings. So option C is the correct answer.

The structure that is homologous to the wing of a bird is the wing of a butterfly, as homologous structures are similar in structure but evolved independently. The correct answer is C.

Answer: C
