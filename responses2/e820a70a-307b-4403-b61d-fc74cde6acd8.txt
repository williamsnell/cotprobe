Okay, so I have this question about Adam Smith and the concept of the division of labor. I remember that the division of labor was a key idea in his theories. Let me think about this step by step.

First, the question is asking how Smith developed this concept. So I need to recall what Smith's work was about. I think Smith wrote about how dividing labor among workers can increase productivity. He probably believed that having workers specialize in certain tasks could lead to more efficient production because each worker is good at their job.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says the division suggests workers rotate between tasks to increase satisfaction. Smith probably thought that if workers could vary their tasks, they'd be more satisfied. But wait, Smith's theory was about how division of labor led to increased productivity, not necessarily about rotation. So A might not be the correct answer.

Option B says the division is a plan to separate tasks for specialization. That sounds right. Smith did propose such a plan, and I think he was referring to dividing tasks so that each worker could become more efficient. So B could be the right answer.

Option C claims the division was first by Marx. I remember that Smith was one of the first to discuss the division of labor, and Marx's ideas were later developed, but Smith's concept came first. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D says it's a term for dividing economic classes. No, that's not right. The division of labor is about dividing tasks, not classes. So D isn't correct.

Option E is about government branches. That's more about the structure of government rather than the concept of labor division. So E isn't the right answer.

Option F says it's distributing workforce evenly. That doesn't align with Smith's idea. His focus was on specialization, not equal distribution. So F is incorrect.

Option G talks about geographical separation. That's part of the division of labor's structure, like specialization in different industries. But Smith's concept itself was about the division of labor itself, not its geographical implications. So G might not be the best fit.

Option H refers to physical division of labor. Again, that's part of the organizational structure, not the division of labor concept. So H isn't correct.

Option I says it's a process of machines replacing workers. That's more about automation rather than the division of labor Smith was talking about. So I can eliminate that.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be B. It's a plan to separate tasks, which aligns with Smith's concept of the division of labor. He was thinking about how dividing labor into specialized tasks would lead to more efficient production.

The correct answer is:

**B: The division of labor is a plan of production that separates work into many different tasks to take advantage of the specialization of labor.**

Smith's concept of the division of labor was about structuring production into specialized tasks to increase efficiency, with workers specializing in different tasks. This aligns with his idea of dividing labor to enhance productivity. 

Answer: B
