Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the Evan and Freeman (1993) paper on corporate liability and rights. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about identifying the two principles mentioned and the term they're applied to. The options are a bunch of combinations and names like corporate liability, rights, etc. I remember from my studies that this paper is about corporate social responsibility, but I'm not entirely sure.

I think the two principles are corporate rights and corporate effect. Wait, or is it corporate liability and corporate effect? I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the terms. Corporate rights are about the rights that a company has to take on the public or its stakeholders. Corporate liability refers to the legal obligation a company has to meet certain standards.

Wait, the paper by Evan and Freeman probably discusses the dual roles a company can have. Like, both corporate rights and corporate responsibility. But the specific terms might be corporate rights and corporate effect. Wait, no. I'm getting mixed up. 

Another approach: think about the structure of the answer. The question says the two principles are used in a specific situation to determine who constitutes a stakeholder. Or shareholder? Or maybe another term.

In the paper, Evan and Freeman discuss the dual responsibilities of a company, such as both rights and obligations. Oh wait, one of the key concepts is the 'stakeholder' but I'm not certain. Or maybe the term is 'stakeholder' in some contexts.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are combinations like Corporate rights and corporate effect, etc. I think the correct pair is corporate rights and corporate effect, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the paper differentiates between corporate rights and corporate responsibility. Oh, wait, wait. The question says the two principles can be used in a specific situation to determine who constitutes a stakeholder. Or perhaps it's about stakeholders.

Alternatively, I think in the paper, they talk about corporate rights and corporate effect. But I'm not certain. Also, the term could be 'stakeholder' or 'shareholder'. 

Wait, another thought. The paper might refer to corporate rights and corporate effect as the two principles, and the category is 'stakeholder'. So looking at the options, let's see what's possible.

Looking at the options, option E is corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder. Hmm, no. Or option J is corporate deniability, corporate effect, stakeholder. No. Option E is corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder. Wait, no. The question says the two principles are used in a specific situation to determine who constitutes a stakeholder.

Wait, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The paper probably discusses both corporate rights and corporate responsibility. Oh right, because the paper is about the dual roles and responsibilities a company has. 

So the two principles are corporate rights and corporate responsibility. Wait, but looking at the options, option I is corporate responsibility and corporate liability, and it's about stakeholder. Hmm. Or option E is corporate rights and corporate liability, stakeholder. That might fit. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: Evan and Freeman's model. From what I remember, they outline corporate rights and corporate responsibility as the two principles. These determine the scope of liability and responsibility. The paper discusses how a company's rights influence its liability.

Looking at the options, option I is corporate responsibility and corporate liability, and it's about stakeholder. But I'm not sure if the term is stakeholder or shareholder. Another thought: The term 'stakeholder' is a general term, but in some contexts, like corporate liabilities, it's referred to as a party.

Wait, the question says 'the specific situation' determines who constitutes a stakeholder. So the term is 'stakeholder'. So looking for an option where both principles are corporate rights and corporate liability, and the category is stakeholder.

Looking at the options, option E is corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder. That seems promising.

Wait, but wait. I thought the two principles were corporate rights and corporate responsibility. Let me double-check. In the paper, they discuss corporate rights and corporate responsibility. Or was it corporate rights and corporate effect?

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option I: corporate responsibility and corporate liability, stakeholder. Or option E: corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Maybe I should think of the structure. The paper is about determining the liability and responsibility of corporations. The two principles are corporate rights and corporate responsibility. So the correct pair is corporate rights and corporate responsibility. But looking at the options, option I is corporate responsibility and corporate liability, which might not fit. Or the correct pair would be corporate rights and corporate responsibility.

Looking at the options again, option I is corporate responsibility and corporate liability, stakeholder. Hmm, that would fit if the principles are corporate responsibility and liability. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E: corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder. Or maybe option J. Wait, another thought: the paper might discuss corporate rights and corporate effect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Another way: the correct answer is option E: corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder. Because I remember that Evan and Freeman discuss the duals of corporate rights and corporate responsibility, which leads to liability and responsibility. But the category is stakeholder in some contexts.

Alternatively, the term is 'stakeholder', which is the third part. So options with the third part 'stakeholder' are options E and J. 

Option E: corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder.
Option J: corporate deniability, corporate effect, stakeholder.

If the principles are corporate rights and corporate liability, then option E fits. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the term is 'stakeholder', then both options E and J are possible.

Another angle: the paper's title is "Evaluating corporate social responsibility: A dual perspective of corporate rights and corporate responsibility". So the two principles are corporate rights and corporate responsibility. But in the answer options, option I is corporate responsibility and corporate liability, and it's about stakeholder. So perhaps the correct answer is option I.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the structure again. The question says the two principles are used in a specific situation to determine who constitutes a stakeholder. So the two principles probably are corporate rights and corporate responsibility, and the category is stakeholder.

Looking at the options, option I is corporate responsibility and corporate liability, stakeholder.

Alternatively, another approach: the two principles are corporate rights and corporate responsibility. The term would be 'stakeholder'. So the correct answer would be option I. Wait, but option I is corporate responsibility and corporate liability, and it's about stakeholder. So if the principles are corporate responsibility and liability, that would fit.

Wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: perhaps the term is 'shareholder', but I don't recall that being the term. I think 'stakeholder' is more commonly used.

So, putting it all together, the correct combination would be corporate rights and corporate responsibility, and the category is stakeholder. Looking for an option with those, option I is corporate responsibility and corporate liability, stakeholder. That seems to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct pair is corporate rights and corporate effect, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's corporate rights and corporate liability.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the paper's title again. It's about corporate social responsibility, so it's discussing corporate rights and corporate responsibility. So the two principles are corporate rights and corporate responsibility. The paper determines who constitutes a stakeholder in a specific situation.

Looking at the options, the only ones that have corporate responsibility and corporate liability are options I and E. E) corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder. Hmm, no, option E doesn't include corporate responsibility. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: corporate responsibility and corporate liability, stakeholder.

Wait, but wait. I think the correct answer is option E: corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder. Because the paper discusses corporate rights and corporate responsibility, which leads to liability and responsibility. The specific situation determines who is a stakeholder.

Alternatively, I'm not certain. I think I need to make a decision. Based on what I remember, the correct answer is option I: corporate responsibility and corporate liability, stakeholder.

Wait, no. Another thought: the paper is about corporate rights and corporate responsibility. So the two principles are corporate rights and corporate responsibility. The term used is 'stakeholder'. Looking at the options, I'm not finding an option that exactly says that. So perhaps the correct option is I, as it's corporate responsibility and corporate liability, and the category is stakeholder.

I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. The correct answer is option E: corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The correct options are:

The question says: the two principles can be used in a specific situation to determine who constitutes a stakeholder.

So among the options, the third part is 'stakeholder'. So the options with the third part 'stakeholder' are option E and J.

Option E is corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder.

Option J is corporate deniability, corporate effect, stakeholder.

If the two principles are corporate rights and corporate liability, and the category is stakeholder, then option E is correct.

Alternatively, if the principles are corporate rights and corporate responsibility, the correct option would be I, but I don't see any option with that. So perhaps option E is the correct answer.

The question asks for the two principles from Evan and Freeman (1993) that determine who constitutes a stakeholder in a specific situation. Based on the analysis:

1. **Understanding the Paper**: The paper discusses corporate rights and corporate responsibility as the two principles.
2. **Identifying the Term**: The specific term used is "stakeholder."
3. **Evaluating Options**: Among the options, only those with "stakeholder" as the third part are considered. The relevant options are E (corporate rights, corporate liability, stakeholder) and J (corporate deniability, corporate effect, stakeholder).
4. **Conclusion**: The correct combination of principles is corporate rights and corporate liability, with "stakeholder" as the category. This matches option E.
