Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why a comet's plasma tail always points away from the Sun. Let's see, the question gives me 10 options, from A to J. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll think this through step by step.

First, let's recall what I know about comets. A comet's tail, or plasma tail, is a trail of ionized gas that comes from the tail end of the comet. This tail is a result of the solar wind, which is a stream of particles from the Sun's active corona. But wait, the question is about why the tail points away from the Sun, not necessarily how it's formed.

Hmm, the options are A through J. Let me go through each.

Option A: The ions are following Keplerian orbits that lead away from the Sun. Keplerian orbits are circular orbits around the Sun, but they're not directed away. The direction depends on their velocity. But the ions in the tail are following the Sun's gravity, which is why they spiral inward. But does that explain their direction? Probably not. Because Keplerian orbits are about the path, not about direction, so this might not be the right reason.

Option B: Conservation of angular momentum keeps it pointing away. Angular momentum is a conserved quantity, but how does that apply here? Angular momentum is about the direction of the orbit. If the tail is moving away, is there a reason for that? I'm not sure. I think that the tail's direction might be due to something else, like the solar wind pushing the ions in a particular direction.

Option C: The solar wind electromagnetically blows the ions away. The solar wind is a stream of particles (like protons and electrons) that emanate from the Sun. They carry energy and momentum. Electromagnetic radiation would push ions, but I'm not sure how that makes them point away. Or maybe the solar wind is what propels the particles, but I'm not sure that's the reason the tail points away.

Option D: The ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field. I know that the Sun's magnetic field plays a role in the formation of the solar wind. But does it cause the ions in the tail to point away? Or is it more about the solar wind being directed towards the Sun? Wait, the solar wind is directed towards the Sun, but the ions in the tail are coming from behind, so perhaps the magnetic field affects their direction. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe D isn't the right answer.

Option E: Other bodies pull the ions away. The Sun's gravity is strong, but comets don't get pulled away. So this might not be it.

Option F: The tail is a reflection of the Sun's light. I don't think that's how comets work. The tail is more about the solar wind and the ions' movement, not reflecting sunlight. So F is unlikely.

Option G: Ionized towards the colder space. I'm not sure about this. The solar wind should be directed towards the Sun, but I don't know why the ions in the tail would be directed away. Maybe because the Sun's magnetic field has a certain influence, but I'm not certain this is the reason.

Option H: Sun's radiation causes a chemical reaction. Well, the solar wind is mostly ionized gas, but there's also neutral hydrogen and other particles. I think hydrogen is more affected by radiation, but how does that make the ions point away? Maybe the radiation causes some ionization but I'm not sure.

Option I: Heat causes ions to move. I know that the Sun's thermal emission can cause ionization, but again, I'm not sure how that makes the ions point away.

Option J: Radiation pressure from light pushes them away. Radiation pressure is the effect of electromagnetic radiation on matter. So, the Sun's light would exert pressure on the ions. That pressure might have a component that pushes the ions away from the Sun. But wait, the tail is moving towards the Sun, so if the radiation pressure is pushing away, that would be counterintuitive. Unless the radiation is coming out, but maybe not. Wait, the tail is moving away, so if radiation pushes them away, that would make sense. But how does radiation pressure from sunlight push ions away? I think that's a possibility.

Wait, but when a comet's tail is formed, it's because of the solar wind. The solar wind is directed towards the Sun. So the ions in the tail are moving towards the Sun. But why would radiation pressure push them away? Alternatively, maybe the tail is moving away because the Sun's radiation is somehow carrying the ions away. I'm a bit confused about this.

Alternatively, could radiation pressure from the Sun's light push the ions away? That would mean that the Sun's radiation is providing a force that's pushing the ions out. But the tail is a result of the solar wind, which is a stream of particles directed towards the Sun. So why does it point away?

Wait, maybe the question is about the direction of the solar wind. The solar wind is directed towards the Sun, but comets have tails that point away from the Sun. But why? I think the direction of the solar wind is towards the Sun, but the tail is actually a result of the solar wind being deflected by the Sun's magnetic field. So perhaps the magnetic field is causing the ions in the tail to be deflected away.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

The key point here is why the tail points away. The question is why the ions in the tail are moving away from the Sun.

So, the options are about what causes that.

Option B: Conservation of angular momentum. The solar wind comes from the Sun, so the ions in the tail should follow the Sun's gravity. But if the solar wind is pushed by the Sun, perhaps the ions have some angular momentum that keeps them moving away.

Wait, the angular momentum in the solar wind. The solar wind is a stream of particles emitted with certain velocities, so they have angular momentum. When they enter the solar system, their angular momentum might cause them to spiral in, but the tail is moving away. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the ions in the tail are part of the solar wind. The solar wind has a certain angular momentum. So as the ions move away from the Sun, their angular momentum is carried away. But that would cause them to spiral outward, but the tail is moving away, not perhaps spiraling. So maybe the angular momentum is in a direction that makes them move away.

Wait, but the angular momentum of the solar wind is directed outwards, maybe? Or is it directed in a certain way. Alternatively, the solar wind is directed towards the Sun because of the magnetic field. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions in the tail are deflected away by the Sun's magnetic field, but then why would the tail point away? Because the Sun's magnetic field can deflect the particles. So the tail is the ions that are deflected, so they point in the opposite direction of the solar wind's direction.

Wait, but that would require the Sun's magnetic field to deflect the solar wind, but the tail is the direction the ions are moving. If the ions are coming from behind, perhaps they're deflected by the magnetic field, so the tail points away.

So, if the Sun's magnetic field is causing the ionized gas in the tail to be deflected, then the tail would point away. So option D says the ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field. But I thought that the Sun's magnetic field is what causes the solar wind, not that it repels the ions. Alternatively, perhaps the ions in the tail are being pushed away by the magnetic field.

Wait, but the Sun's magnetic field is responsible for the formation of the solar wind, not the ions in the tail. The solar wind is a stream of particles moving towards the Sun. The ions in the tail are the ones that got deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, so they're moving in the opposite direction.

So the ions are being pushed away by the Sun's magnetic field. So option D is about the ions being repelled by the Sun's magnetic field. That would make sense.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I thought the Sun's magnetic field is responsible for the direction of the solar wind. The solar wind is a stream of protons and electrons, and the ions in the tail are being affected by the Sun's magnetic field. So they are being pushed away, which would cause them to point in the opposite direction of the solar wind.

Alternatively, maybe the tail points away because the ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the tail points away because the ions are moving in a direction opposite to the solar wind, which is directed towards the Sun. If the ions are being deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, then they would be moving in the opposite direction. So the magnetic field is repelling the ions, causing them to move away.

So if the Sun's magnetic field is repelling the ions, then the tail would point away. So option D.

But wait, I'm not certain. Some sources say that the Sun's magnetic field causes the solar wind to be deflected, but the ions in the tail are moving away. So, the magnetic field is causing the ions in the tail to be deflected from the path of the solar wind.

Hmm, but the Sun's magnetic field is not the cause of the ions in the tail's direction. It's more about the ions being deflected by the field. So the Sun's magnetic field is acting on the ions, causing them to be pushed away, which makes the tail point away.

So option D: The ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field.

Another consideration: option J says radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away. So radiation pressure is the push from the Sun's radiation on the ions. How does that affect the ions?

I think that the Sun's light is a high-energy radiation field. The solar wind is ionized, so free electrons and ions. When high-energy photons (like X-rays and gamma rays) collide with electrons, they can ionize the ions and produce radiation pressure. But I'm not sure how that affects the direction of the ions.

Wait, radiation pressure from the Sun's light is a force that tends to push the ions away. So if the ions are being pushed away by the radiation, that would make them move away from the Sun. But the tail is a result of the solar wind. So if the radiation is causing the ions to move away, then the tail would point away.

But I'm not sure if this is the case. I thought the Sun's magnetic field is the main reason for the direction of the solar wind. The radiation might influence the ions, but the main cause is the magnetic field.

So, the question is, why does the tail point away? The options are about the reasons. The correct answer is likely B, because the angular momentum is involved.

Wait, another angle: The angular momentum of the solar wind. The solar wind is a stream of particles, each with a certain angular momentum. As they enter the solar system, their orbital angular momentum might be carried away, causing them to spiral into the Sun. But the tail is moving away, not spiraling. So perhaps the solar wind's angular momentum is directed in a way that causes the ions to move away from the Sun.

Wait, but the solar wind is directed towards the Sun. So the ions in the tail are from behind, so their angular momentum might be in the direction of the Sun, causing them to spiral out. But that's not what the tail is. The tail is moving away, which is opposite to the direction the solar wind is coming from.

I'm getting stuck. Let's think about each option again.

Option B: Conservation of angular momentum keeps it pointing away. So if the solar wind's angular momentum is conserved, that would mean the ions carry that angular momentum away. But the solar wind is directed towards the Sun, so the ions are being pulled in, but their angular momentum is conserved, which might not explain why they're moving away.

Option D: The ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field. If the Sun's magnetic field causes the ions to be pushed away, then the tail would point away. That's a possible scenario.

Alternatively, the tail is the result of the solar wind being deflected by the Sun's magnetic field. The magnetic field of the Sun is a dipolar field, which causes the solar wind to be deflected, not the ions. So the ions in the tail are being pushed in the direction opposite to the solar wind's direction, hence pointing away.

So, for instance, the Sun's magnetic field causes the solar wind to curve around the Sun, but the ions would be pushed away from that curve, causing the tail to point away.

But wait, the solar wind is a stream of particles moving in a generally outward direction. The Sun's magnetic field causes it to curve in a path that is, for example, a circle. So the ions are moving along that path, but the tail is the part that comes from behind, so they are deflected into the opposite direction.

So the tail is moving away from the Sun because the ions are deflected by the Sun's magnetic field. So the tail's ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field.

So option D would be correct.

Alternatively, option J says radiation pressure pushes them away. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the solar wind is a high-energy particle stream. The Sun's light can ionize the ions, but the radiation pressure from the Sun's light is a force that would push the ions away. However, I don't think the primary cause for the direction of the tail is radiation pressure from the Sun's light. The Sun's magnetic field is more significant in shaping the solar wind's direction.

So, the correct answer is likely option J — radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

The Sun emits a lot of high-energy radiation, including X-rays and gamma rays. When these photons interact with the ions in the solar wind, they can ionize them and produce radiation pressure. But how does that affect their direction? Maybe the radiation pressure causes the ions to be pushed outwards.

But I'm not sure. I think that's not the main reason the ions are in the tail. The main reason is the Sun's magnetic field causing the solar wind to be deflected, which results in the ions being in the tail and directed away.

So, given all this, I think the correct answer is option B — conservation of angular momentum. Wait, but wait. The solar wind's angular momentum is directed away from the Sun. So the ions in the tail have angular momentum that's away from the Sun, which could cause them to follow the Sun's gravity. But if the solar wind is coming from behind, their angular momentum might carry them away.

Alternatively, the angular momentum of the solar wind is conserved, which would mean that the orbit of the ions is such that they follow the Sun's gravity. But the tail is a spiral path, not a straight line, so that's not matching.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the best choice among the options is B or D.

Wait, another approach: the options that are about the Sun's magnetic field. Option D says the ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field. That would cause the ions to be pushed away. So why wouldn't the ions be repelled by something else?

Alternatively, the tail is the result of the solar wind being deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, so the ions are deflected, hence pointing away. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought option J is radiation pressure. So which is it?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think about the physics of the solar wind and the magnetic field.

The Sun's magnetic field is responsible for the solar wind's direction. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles (protons, electrons, He ions) that is deflected by the Sun's magnetic field. This deflection causes the ions in the tail to be pushed away from the path of the solar wind.

So, the solar wind is coming from behind the Sun, and the Sun's magnetic field bends it so it curves around the Sun. The ions in the tail are part of this deflected solar wind and hence are deflected outward, so the tail points away.

So, the main reason is the Sun's magnetic field causing the deflection of the solar wind, which pulls the ions away from the Sun. So the correct answer is D.

But wait, I thought that option J is about radiation pressure. Another angle: the Sun's light is a high-energy radiation field that can ionize the solar wind. The ions are accelerated by the radiation, and radiation pressure might push them away. But again, I'm not sure if that's the main reason.

Wait, the Sun's light does cause ionization, but the main cause for the direction of the solar wind is the magnetic field. So the correct answer is D. Because the ions are being deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, causing the tail to point away.

So, the correct answer is option D.
</think>

The question asks why the plasma tail of a comet always points away from the Sun. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed based on the physical principles governing the solar wind and the Sun's magnetic field.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: The ions following Keplerian orbits away from the Sun is incorrect because Keplerian orbits describe circular paths around the Sun, not the direction of ionized gas like the tail. The tail's direction is not directed away from the Sun.

2. **Option B**: Conservation of angular momentum keeping the tail away from the Sun is unlikely. While angular momentum is conserved, the solar wind's direction is not solely determined by this principle, and the tail's observed direction is not explained by this reasoning.

3. **Option C**: Solar wind electromagnetically blowing the ions away is incorrect. The solar wind is not described as "blowing" the ions; instead, it is deflected by the Sun's magnetic field.

4. **Option D**: The ions being repelled by the Sun's magnetic field is plausible. The Sun's magnetic field bends the solar wind, causing the ions in the tail to be deflected away from the Sun. This deflection explains the observed direction of the tail.

5. **Option E**: Sun's heat causing ionization and deflection is incorrect. While the Sun's high-energy radiation can ionize ions, the primary cause of the tail's direction is the Sun's magnetic field.

6. **Option F**: The tail as a reflection of sunlight is incorrect. The tail is a result of the solar wind being deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, not a reflection of sunlight.

7. **Option G**: Natural repulsion by the Sun is incorrect. The Sun's magnetic field is the primary factor, not a natural repulsion.

8. **Option H**: Radiation pressure from sunlight pushing the ions away is plausible. However, the Sun's magnetic field is the main cause of the tail's direction, not radiation pressure.

9. **Option J**: Radiation pressure from sunlight pushing the ions away is incorrect. While radiation pressure can influence ion motion, it is not the primary reason for the tail's direction.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the Sun's magnetic field bends the solar wind, causing the ions in the tail to be deflected away from the Sun. This is best captured by **Option D**.
