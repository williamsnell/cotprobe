Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about the oxidation number of chlorine in perchlorate ion, ClO4⁻. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my oxidation numbers, but let's try to think this through.

Wait, what's a perchlorate ion again? Oh right, it's ClO4⁻. So the formula is Cl followed by O4, and a negative charge. I need to find the oxidation number of Cl in that.

Right, oxidation numbers are a way to determine the charge of an element in a compound. The rules are that the sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral molecule is zero, and for polyatomic ions, the sum is equal to the charge of the ion.

So, for ClO4⁻, the charge is -1. Each O is usually -2, right? So four O's would be 4 * (-2) = -8.

So, let's set up an equation. The sum of oxidation numbers equals the charge of the ion. So Cl + (O's) = charge.

That gives Cl + (-8) = -1.

Wait, solving for Cl: Cl equals (-1) + 8. Which is 7. So Cl has an oxidation number of +7.

Looking at the options, which one is 7? The options are A:7, B:2, C:-2, D:5, E:-3, F:1, G:6, H:-1, I:3, J:4.

So option A is 7. That must be the right answer.

To determine the oxidation number of chlorine in the perchlorate ion, ClO4⁻, we start by noting that the overall charge of the ion is -1. Each oxygen atom typically has an oxidation number of -2, so four oxygen atoms contribute a total of 4 × (-2) = -8. 

Let the oxidation number of chlorine be represented as \( x \). The sum of the oxidation numbers in the ion must equal its charge, so:

\[
x + (-8) = -1
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = -1 + 8 = 7
\]

Thus, the oxidation number of chlorine in ClO4⁻ is +7. Among the given options, the correct answer is **A: 7**.
