Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about radioactive isotopes and their uses in biological research. I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's think through this step by step.

The question is asking how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research, specifically in tracing the pathways of compounds made in living cells. Hmm. I remember that radioactive isotopes are used for labeling things, which helps track where things go in the cell and organism.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Labeling with radioisotopes is powerful for studying metabolic pathways and other areas. That sounds familiar. I think in biology, labeling substances helps track their movement, which is crucial for understanding pathways. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Option B: Radioactive isotopes improve food flavor and texture. I don't think that's right. Radioactive isotopes are used for labeling, not to enhance taste.

Option C: Stimulate immune system? No, that doesn't fit. I don't recall using radioisotopes for immune stimulation.

Option D: Oxygen-carrying capacity. That's more about metabolism, maybe, but I don't think that's the primary use of radioisotopes in biological studies. Maybe in cell studies or something else.

Option E: Enhance agricultural crops. Not sure, but I don't remember this as a major application. Maybe in some specific cases, but not the primary.

Option F: Direct nutrient supplement. No, that's more about food, not biological processes.

Option G: Glow-in-the-dark materials. I think glow-in-the-dark materials are made using light-sensitive isotopes, like those in certain plastics or chemicals. So this isn't about radioactive isotopes for that purpose.

Option H: Energy for spacecraft. That's more about nuclear power and space exploration, but not the primary use of radioisotopes in biology.

Option I: Kill cancer cells. I'm not sure if that's a main application. Maybe in cell therapy or something, but I don't recall radioisotopes being the main tool for that.

Option J: Dating samples. Oh, right! Radioactive isotopes are used in radiometric dating. For example, carbon-14 is used to date organic materials. So this is a legitimate application in biological research and archaeology.

Wait, but the question is about biological research, like tracing pathways in living cells. So J is about dating, which is a different use case, perhaps.

So, which options tie directly to tracing pathways?

Looking back, option A says labeling is used for metabolic pathways. That makes sense because labeling helps map where things go, which is crucial for understanding chemical pathways in living organisms.

So the correct answer should be A.

Radioactive isotopes are powerful tools in biological research for tracking changes in compounds synthesized in living cells. Among the options provided, option A accurately describes their use in tracing metabolic pathways, which is essential for understanding cellular processes. While option J, about dating, is also an application of radioactive isotopes, it pertains more broadly to scientific use rather than specifically tracing pathways. Therefore, the best answer is:

ANSWER: A
