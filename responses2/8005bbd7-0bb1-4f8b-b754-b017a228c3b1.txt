Okay, I have this math problem in front of me, and I need to find the value of (2^20 + 2^20 + 2^20 + 2^21) divided by 2^17. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

Wait, let me read it again. The numerator is 2^20 plus 2^20 plus 2^20 plus 2^21. So that's four terms of 2^20 each plus another 2^21. And then I have to divide that by 2^17. 

I think I should first simplify the numerator. Let me count how many 2^20 terms there are. There are three 2^20s and then one 2^21. So that's 3*(2^20) + 2^21. 

Wait, but 2^21 is the same as 2*2^20, right? Because 2^21 = 2^20 * 2. So maybe I can express everything in terms of 2^20 to make it easier.

So substituting that, the numerator becomes 3*(2^20) + 2*(2^20). Because 2^21 is 2 times 2^20. So that's (3 + 2) * 2^20, which is 5*2^20.

Wait, but wait a second. That can't be right because 2^20 + 2^20 is 2*2^20, and then adding another 2^20 makes it 3*2^20. Then adding 2^21 which is 2*2^20, it's 3*2^20 + 2*2^20 = 5*2^20. Oh, so numerator is 5*2^20.

So the expression becomes (5*2^20) divided by 2^17. So that's 5 multiplied by (2^20 / 2^17). 

Now, when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So 2^20 divided by 2^17 is 2^(20-17) = 2^3 = 8. So, 5 * 8 = 40.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out 2^17 from 2^20 and 2^21.

So 2^20 is 2^17 * 2^3, because 2^20 = 2^(17+3) = 2^17 * 8. Similarly, 2^21 is 2^17 * 2^4 = 2^17 * 16.

So substituting back, the numerator becomes:

3*(2^17 * 8) + 1*(2^17 *16) = 2^17*(3*8 + 16) = 2^17*(24 +16) = 2^17*40.

Then the entire expression is (2^17 *40) /2^17. The 2^17 cancels out, leaving 40.

So the answer is 40, which is option C.

To solve the expression \((2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{21}) \div 2^{17}\), we start by simplifying the numerator:

- \(2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} = 3 \times 2^{20}\)
- \(2^{21} = 2 \times 2^{20}\)
- Combining these, the numerator becomes \(3 \times 2^{20} + 2 \times 2^{20} = 5 \times 2^{20}\)

Now, divide by \(2^{17}\):

\[
\frac{5 \times 2^{20}}{2^{17}} = 5 \times 2^{20-17} = 5 \times 2^3 = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

The answer is 40, which corresponds to option C.
