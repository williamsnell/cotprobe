Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Hume's arguments in natural law. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question is asking what Hume's argument is based on regarding natural law. The options are A to D. Hume was a philosopher and someone who contributed a lot to epistemology and ethics. I remember that natural law theory is a big topic in legal and moral philosophy, especially from Hume's time.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong. Hmm, I think Hume's perspective was that moral and ethical principles are not innate or universal, and we can't know them because they are subjective. But wait, is this the foundation of his argument? I'm not sure. I think he might have argued that the law is based on custom or social norms, not necessarily on universal principles. So maybe he's saying it's not about our objective knowledge, but more about the nature of the law itself.

Option B: Natural law is backward-looking. Backward-looking laws involve future consequences. Hume didn't think that natural law (which is based on present and past) is backward, because he believed that these laws are the result of human actions and are therefore forward-looking. So this might not be the correct answer.

Option C: There is no such thing as a social contract. A social contract refers to agreements among people, like in contracts. Hume might have thought that natural law doesn't rely on contracts. In fact, I think he might have argued that natural law is based on the principle of justice, which is about fairness and equality, not contracts. So this could be correct, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Natural law fails to protect the state against attacks. I'm not too sure about this one. From what I recall, Hume's natural law theory was about creating a system of justice and preventing crimes. So maybe D is not the correct answer.

Wait, let me think again. Hume's natural law theory is based on the idea that all actions are inherently right unless they violate certain principles. He argued that natural law is a system of justice based on social contracts, but he didn't necessarily believe in backward-looking laws or that it fails to protect the state. Oh wait, perhaps he didn't see a problem with natural law in protecting the state. So maybe D is not the correct answer.

Alternatively, let's focus on the main points. Hume's natural law is about the law being based on the principle of justice and fairness. He believed in the law as a rule of conduct, not something that could be created by humans. So he might have argued that natural law is not backward-looking because it's based on present and past actions, not future consequences. 

But wait, the question is about the argument that Hume made. Let me recall: Hume's arguments against natural law were about the existence of moral laws being not universal and not capable of being established through reason. So perhaps the answer is about the nature of the law, not about its effectiveness in protecting the state.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me look at the options again. The question is about the argument Hume made about natural law. So the correct answer would be about what Hume's argument was regarding natural law.

In the context of natural law, Hume might have argued that natural law is based on the principle of justice, which is a rule of conduct, but he might not necessarily deny the effectiveness of natural law in protecting the state. Instead, he might have focused on the nature of the law itself.

Alternatively, I think Hume's natural law theory is often contrasted with divine law. Hume's natural law is based on the idea of a social contract, where people agree to act in certain ways. But he didn't think that natural law is backward-looking because it's based on the present and past events.

Wait, another angle: Hume's argument. I remember that in his work "An History of Philosophy," he discusses how natural law is based on the principle that people are meant to be beneficial and not harmful. So maybe he's arguing that natural law is not backward because it's about the present actions and future consequences, but that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A: We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong. Because, as I thought earlier, Hume believed that moral principles are not innate and that we don't have an objective way to know them. So he might argue that natural law is based on these subjective principles, which we can't know or establish objectively. So option A would be the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: I thought that Hume didn't believe you can know what's right and wrong. Instead, he thought it's about the actions and consequences. So maybe the argument he made is that natural law is based on the principles of justice, which are subjective and not something we can know objectively. So the correct answer would be A.

The correct answer is A: We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong. Hume's argument is based on the belief that moral principles, such as justice, are not innate and are subjective. He suggests that natural law is rooted in these subjective principles, which we cannot objectively determine. This aligns with his emphasis on the role of custom and social contracts in creating a system of justice, rather than claiming effectiveness in protecting the state.
