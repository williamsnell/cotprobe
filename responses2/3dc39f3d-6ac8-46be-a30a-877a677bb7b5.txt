Okay, so I've got this problem about a Speedway Racing Set, and I'm trying to figure out the net price after successive discounts. Let me think through it step by step.

The original price is $84. The discounts are 20% and then 10%. I need to calculate the net price after applying both discounts.

First, I should calculate the first discount. 20% off of $84. To find 20%, I can multiply 84 by 0.20. Let me do that: 84 * 0.20 = 16.80. So the first discount is $16.80. 

Subtracting that from the original price: 84 - 16.80 = $67.20. That's the price after the 20% discount.

Now, the next discount is 10% off. I need to calculate 10% of $67.20. Let me compute that: 67.20 * 0.10 = $6.72. 

Subtracting this from the current price: 67.20 - 6.72 = $60.48. That's the final price after both discounts.

Looking at the options, option B is $60.48, which matches my calculation. So I think the correct answer is B.

The net price after successive discounts of 20% and 10% on an original price of \$84 is calculated as follows:

1. **First Discount (20%):**  
   20% of 84 is 16.80.  
   Price after discount: 84 - 16.80 = 67.20.

2. **Second Discount (10%):**  
   10% of 67.20 is 6.72.  
   Final price: 67.20 - 6.72 = 60.48.

The net price is \$60.48, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B: $60.48**
