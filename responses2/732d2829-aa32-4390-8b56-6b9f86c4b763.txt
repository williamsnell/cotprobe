Okay, so I've got this question about rainfall in a city and normal distribution. Hmm, let's see. The question says that monthly rainfall is approximately normally distributed with a mean of six inches and a standard deviation of 1.6 inches. They're asking for the highest amount of rainfall that would still make a month among the 10 percent driest months. Oh wait, right, the driest months are the ones with less than a certain amount. 

So, wait. So, normally, in a normal distribution, the mean is the center point. The 10th percentile would be the value below which 10% of the data falls. So, in this case, the city's rainfall is about normally distributed. So, the 10th percentile would be a value such that 90% of the months have more than that, and 10% have less.

But wait, wait. Wait, no. Actually, the 10th percentile is the value such that 10% of the months have less than that. So, the question is asking for the 10th percentile of the monthly rainfall. Because if the rainfall is below that, it's among the driest 10 percent.

So, to find that, I think I need to find the z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile, then convert that into the actual rainfall value using the mean and standard deviation.

I remember that the z-score for the 10th percentile is about -1.28. Let me double-check. Because the 50th percentile is 0 (the mean), the 84th is about 1, and the 16th is around -1. So, 10th is definitely around -1.28. I think 1.28 is for the 90th percentile. Let me think: the 50th is 0, 68th is about 1, 84th is 1.09, 89th is 1.28. So, 10th is the negative of that, so about -1.28.

So, the z-score is -1.28. Then, using the formula: z = (X - μ) / σ.

We can rearrange this to find X: X = μ + z*σ.

Given μ is 6 inches, σ is 1.6 inches.

So X = 6 + (-1.28)*1.6.

Let me calculate that. 1.28 * 1.6. Let's see, 1.28 * 1.6... Well, 1 times 1.6 is 1.6, 0.28 times 1.6 is 0.448. So total is 1.6 + 0.448 = 2.048. So, X = 6 - 2.048 = 3.952 inches.

So, approximately 3.95 inches. Looking at the options, H is 3.95. So, the answer should be H.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the percentile. Oh wait, wait. Wait, sometimes I get confused with percentiles. The 10th percentile is the value where 10% of the data is below it. So, a value of 3.95 inches means that 10% of the months have less than 3.95 inches, and 90% have more. So, that would make it the 10th percentile, and thus the city would be among the 10% driest. So, yes, the answer is H, 3.95.

The amount of rainfall per month is normally distributed with a mean of 6 inches and a standard deviation of 1.6 inches. To find the highest rainfall that places the city among the 10% driest months, we calculate the 10th percentile. The z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28. Using the formula X = μ + z*σ, where μ=6 and σ=1.6, we find:

X = 6 + (-1.28)(1.6) = 6 - 2.048 = 3.952 inches, which rounds to 3.95 inches. The correct answer is H.

Answer: H
