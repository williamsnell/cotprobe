Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the mass of one molecule of cholesterol, which has the formula C27H46O. The molecular mass is given as 386 g/mol. 

Hmm, I remember that to find the mass of a single molecule, I need to use Avogadro's number. Oh right, Avogadro's number is about 6.022 x 10^23 molecules per mole. So the plan is to divide the molecular mass by Avogadro's number to get the mass per molecule.

Wait, let me write that down. The formula for the mass of a molecule would be (molecular mass) divided by Avogadro's number. So it's 386 g/mol divided by 6.022e23 molecules/mol. Let me do the math.

First, let's compute 386 divided by 6.022. Let me get a calculator. 386 ÷ 6.022 is approximately 64.1. Wait, no, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, wait, wait. No, wait, 6.022e23 is Avogadro's number. So 386 divided by 6.022e23 would be 386/(6.022 * 1e23). Let me compute that.

Hmm, 386 / 6.022 is about 64.1 (because 6 * 60 is 360, 6.022 *64 is about 385.3), so 64.1. But since it's 6.022e23, the number would be 64.1 / 1e23, which is 6.41e-22 grams per molecule. Oh wait, because 64.1 divided by 1e23 is 6.41 x 10^-22. 

Wait, wait a second. Wait, 386 divided by 6.022e23. Let me compute this more accurately. Let me compute 386 ÷ 6.022.

6.022 is approximately 6.022. So 386 divided by 6.022 is approximately 64.12. So 64.12 divided by 1e23 is 6.412e-22 grams. So that's the mass per molecule.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A: 3 × 10^-23 g → smaller than our value, so no.

B:7.15e-22 → close to our 6.4, but not exactly.

C:1.38e-21 → bigger.

D:6.41e-22 → Oh wait, our value is 6.41e-22, which is exactly option D.

Wait, but let me check the math again. 386 divided by 6.022 is approximately 64.1 (since 6.022 × 64 = 385.408), so 386 is a little more, so around 64.12. So 64.12 divided by 1e23 is 6.412e-22 g. So option D is 6.41e-22, which matches.

But wait, wait, let me think again. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 per mole. So 386 g per mole is (386 g) / (6.022e23 molecules/mol) = (386 / 6.022) * 1e-23 g per molecule. So 386 /6.022 is approximately 64.12, so 64.12e-23 is 6.412e-22 g. So the correct answer is D: 6.41 ×10^-22 g.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options again. Let me check the choices again. The options are from A to J. A is 3e-23, which is smaller, no. B is 7.15e-22, which is a bit larger than our 6.41e-22. C is 1.38e-21, that's much bigger. Then D is 6.41e-22, which is exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the mass of one molecule of cholesterol (C27H46O) with a molecular mass of 386 g/mol, we use Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mol. The formula for the mass of one molecule is:

\[
\text{Mass of one molecule} = \frac{\text{Molecular mass}}{\text{Avogadro's number}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Mass of one molecule} = \frac{386}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 6.41 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{g}
\]

Now, comparing this result with the provided options:

- **A: 3 × 10⁻²³ g** → Too small.
- **B: 7.15 × 10⁻²² g** → Slightly larger than our calculated value.
- **C: 1.38 × 10⁻²¹ g** → Much larger.
- **D: 6.41 × 10⁻²² g** → Matches our calculation exactly.
- **E: 8.41 × 10⁻²² g** → Slightly larger.
- **F: 1 × 10⁻²² g** → Too small.
- **G: 5 × 10⁻²³ g** → Too small.
- **H: 2.38 × 10⁻²¹ g** → Too large.
- **I: 1.5 × 10⁻²¹ g** → Too large.
- **J: 2.5 × 10⁻²¹ g** → Too large.

The correct answer is **D: 6.41 × 10⁻²² g**.
