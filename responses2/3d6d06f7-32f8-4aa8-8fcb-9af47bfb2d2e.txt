Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation of an automobile. Let's see... The car cost $3,000 four years ago and now it's worth $1,000. I need to find the average yearly depreciation. Hmm, I remember that depreciation is the decrease in value over time. But wait, there are different methods to calculate it, like straight-line depreciation. Oh right, straight-line is when the value decreases evenly each year.

So, the formula for straight-line depreciation is (Cost - Salvage Value) divided by the number of years. The cost here is $3,000, and the salvage value is $1,000. That means the total depreciation over four years is $3,000 - $1,000 = $2,000. Then, divide that by 4 years. Let me do the math: $2,000 divided by 4 is $500 per year. So each year, the car loses $500 in value.

Looking at the options, option C is $500. That must be the answer. Let me just double-check. Oh yeah, 4 years times $500 gives $2,000 depreciation, which matches the total cost minus salvage. So the average yearly depreciation is $500. So I think option C is correct.

The average yearly depreciation can be calculated using the straight-line method. The formula is:

Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Number of Years

Here, Cost = $3,000, Salvage Value = $1,000, and Number of Years = 4.

Depreciation = ($3,000 - $1,000) / 4 = $2,000 / 4 = $500 per year.

The correct answer is **C: $500**.
