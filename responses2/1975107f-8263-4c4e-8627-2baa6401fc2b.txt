Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about minks and their fur colors. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about what genetic cross could produce offspring with only silver fur. The parents both have brown fur, and the gene for brown (B) is dominant over silver (b). So, the possible genotypes for each parent would be either BB or Bb.

The question gives four options, but wait, the options are labeled from A to H, but the question says the options are listed A to H, but the question is a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, the user provided the options as A to H, each with different combinations. Let me see.

So, the parents are both brown-fur (B), meaning their genotype possibilities are BB or Bb. The question is asking which cross could result in all the offspring having silver fur, which would be bb. Because for a recessive trait like this, only the homozygous recessive genotype will express the trait.

So for each parent, if they're both Bb, then when they cross, what do they produce? Let's think. Each parent can produce gametes B and b. So the possible offspring genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb. The phenotypes would be brown (for BB and Bb) and silver (for bb).

Wait, but the question is about having all offspring with silver fur. So, the only way that happens is if all the offspring are bb. Because if even one is BB or Bb, the phenotype would be brown.

So the parents must both be Bb so that their gametes can give b to each offspring. Because if one parent is BB, then all offspring would be Bb (since BB can't produce b gametes), which would have brown fur, not silver.

Looking at the options:

Option C is Bb Bb. So both parents are Bb. So, each parent can produce B and b gametes. So when they cross, the possible offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So the chance of getting all bb is low, but it's possible. So the offspring would have a mix of brown and silver. But the question is asking for all silver. So this cross (option C) would not give all offspring silver. Because even though some are bb, others are brown.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. The parents are both Bb. So when they make gametes, each has a 50% chance of B and 50% chance of b. So the possible offspring would be:

- B from one parent and B from the other: BB (25%)
- B and b: Bb (50%)
- b and b: bb (25%)

So the outcome is that 75% of the offspring are brown (BB and Bb) and 25% are silver (bb). So a cross between two Bb parents can't produce all silver fur.

Wait, but the question is asking for a cross that could produce all offspring with silver. So perhaps none of the options except option E or another. Let me look.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option E: BB Bb. So one parent is BB, other is Bb. So the parents are BB (so can only make B gametes) and Bb (can make B and b). So the possible offspring are B from each parent. So all offspring would be BB or Bb. So their fur would be brown. So the offspring would have brown fur. So that's not the scenario we want.

Option D: Bb bb. Wait, wait, how are these presented? Oh, wait, the options are in pairs, like "Bb Bb" is option C. So the parents could be Bb and Bb. Wait, but that's what I thought earlier. So that cross would produce a mix of brown and silver, but there's a 25% chance of all being silver (but wait, wait, no. Each parent can only give b in 50% of the gametes, so to get all offspring as bb, each gamete must be b. So the chance is 25% of each individual. So the chance that all offspring are bb is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, or 25%. But the question is asking for a cross that could produce all silver. So technically, this cross could potentially produce such offspring, but in reality, each offspring has a 25% chance, but any cross would have a low probability.

Wait, but the question is about whether such a cross is possible. So, is there any option where the parents are both homozygous recessive (bb), so that all offspring would be bb. Because if the parents are bb, their gametes are b, so all offspring would be bb. So the cross to get all silver would have to be two bb parents.

Looking at the options:

Option F: bb Bb. So one parent is bb (can only give b), the other is Bb (can give B or b). So the offspring would be Bb (50%) and bb (50%). So they can have both brown and silver. So this cross doesn't produce all silver.

Wait, but what about option F? Let me think again. So parents are bb (so all gametes are b) and Bb (so gametes are B and b). So offspring are Bb (50%) and bb (50%). So 50% brown, 50% silver.

So the only way to get all offspring as silver is to have both parents be bb. But looking at the options, option F is bb Bb. So that's not the case.

Wait, but looking at the options again: the options list each cross as a pair. So for example, option F is bb Bb. So each parent is either bb or Bb.

Wait, let's check all the options:

Option A: bb bb.

So both parents are bb. So their gametes are b. So all offspring are bb. So the cross would produce all offspring with silver fur. So this is a possible scenario.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A: bb bb

B: Bb BB

C: Bb Bb

D: Bb bb

E: BB Bb

F: bb Bb

G: BB BB

H: Bb Bb Bb

I: BB bb

So, each option represents the genotype of each parent. So for option C, it's Bb and Bb. So each parent can give B or b. So the possible offspring would be BB, Bb, and bb. So the chance of getting all bb is 25%, but the question is whether such a cross is possible. So having a cross that produces all offspring with silver is possible, but the options don't include that. Wait, but the question is asking which set of genotypes represents a cross that could produce offspring with silver fur.

Wait, but let's think again. The cross that results in all offspring being bb would require both parents to be homozygous recessive (bb). So looking at the options, option A is bb and bb. So that's correct. So option A is a possible cross that would produce all silver fur.

But wait, wait. The parents in option A are both bb. So each can only give a b allele. So when crossed, all offspring would be bb. So they would all have silver fur.

But in the question, the options are presented as pairs (e.g., A: bb bb, B: Bb BB, etc.), and each option is a cross. So the correct answer would be option A: bb bb. Because that's the only cross that produces all offspring with silver.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the answer is the correct one. So which option is that?

In the question, the options are:

A: bb bb

B: Bb BB

C: Bb Bb

D: Bb bb

E: BB Bb

F: bb Bb

G: BB BB

H: Bb Bb Bb

I: BB bb

So, the correct answer is option A, which is bb and bb. That would produce all offspring bb, all silver.

Wait wait, but looking again, does the cross in option A produce all offspring with silver, or could it produce some? Because the question is which cross could produce offspring with silver. So option A, when crossed, would result in all offspring being bb. So all silver.

So the correct answer is option A. But wait, hold on. Let me check another option. For example, option F is bb Bb. So one parent is bb (can only give b), the other is Bb (gives B or b). So the offspring would be 50% Bb (brown) and 50% bb (silver). So the cross could produce some silver, but not all.

So the only cross where all offspring have silver is option A.

Wait a minute, but wait another thing. The parents in option C are Bb and Bb. So each can produce B or b. So the possible offspring would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So 75% of the offspring would be brown and 25% silver. So that cross would not produce all silver. It's possible in some cases, but not all. So the cross described in option C could produce some silver and brown, but not all.

So the only cross that produces all offspring with silver is option A, which is bb and bb. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine which set of genotypes represents a cross that could produce offspring with silver fur (genotype **bb**) from parents that both have brown fur (genotypes **B**), we analyze the possible offspring phenotypes based on the genetic cross:

1. **Brown fur (B) is dominant over silver fur (b)**, so the presence of at least one **B** allele results in brown fur, and the absence of **B** alleles (i.e., **bb**) results in silver fur.

2. **For all offspring to have silver fur (**bb**), both parents must be homozygous recessive (**bb**). This is because homozygous recessive (**bb**) parents can only produce **b** gametes, resulting in **bb** offspring.

3. **Examining the options:**
   - **Option A (bb bb):** Both parents are homozygous recessive (**bb**). All offspring will inherit **b** from each parent, resulting in **bb** and thus all silver fur.
   - **Option B (Bb BB):** One parent is heterozygous (**Bb**) and the other is homozygous dominant (**BB**). The offspring can be **BB** (brown) or **Bb** (brown), so no offspring will have silver fur.
   - **Option C (Bb Bb):** One parent is heterozygous (**Bb**) and the other is homozygous recessive (**bb**). The offspring can be **BB** (brown), **Bb** (brown), or **bb** (silver). There is a 25% chance of all offspring being silver, but it is not guaranteed.
   - **Option D (Bb bb):** One parent is heterozygous (**Bb**) and the other is homozygous recessive (**bb**). The offspring can be **Bb** (brown) or **bb** (silver). There is a 50% chance of all offspring being silver, but it is not guaranteed.
   - **Option E (BB Bb):** One parent is homozygous dominant (**BB**) and the other is heterozygous (**Bb**). The offspring can be **BB** (brown) or **Bb** (brown), so no offspring will have silver fur.
   - **Option F (bb Bb):** One parent is homozygous recessive (**bb**) and the other is heterozygous (**Bb**). The offspring can be **Bb** (brown) or **bb** (silver). There is a 50% chance of all offspring being silver, but it is not guaranteed.
   - **Option G (BB BB):** Both parents are homozygous dominant (**BB**). All offspring will inherit **B** from each parent, resulting in **BB** (brown), so no offspring will have silver fur.
   - **Option H (Bb Bb Bb):** One parent is heterozygous (**Bb**) and the other two are homozygous recessive (**bb**). This cross is not possible because only two parents can be involved in a cross, and this option represents three parents.
   - **Option I (BB bb):** One parent is homozygous dominant (**BB**) and the other is heterozygous (**bb**). The offspring can be **BB** (brown) or **Bb** (brown), so no offspring will have silver fur.

4. **Conclusion:** The only cross that guarantees all offspring will have silver fur (**bb**) is **Option A (bb bb)**, where both parents are homozygous recessive.
