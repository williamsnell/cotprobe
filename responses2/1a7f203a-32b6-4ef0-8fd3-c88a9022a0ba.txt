Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about making wine bottles using soda-lime glass. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that manufacturers use sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), limestone (CaCO₃), and sand (SiO₂) to make soda-lime glass. The reaction equation is given as Na₂CO₃ + CaCO₃ + 6SiO₂ → Na₂O·CaO·6SiO₂ + 2CO₂. The goal is to make 5000 wine bottles, each weighing 400 grams. I need to find out how many grams of sand are required.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to find out how much of each reactant is needed. Wait, but the question is about sand, which is SiO₂. So I should look at the stoichiometry of the reaction. 

Looking at the equation, the reactants are Na₂CO₃, CaCO₃, and 6 SiO₂. The products are Na₂O·CaO and 2 CO₂. So each mole of the reaction produces 6 moles of SiO₂. 

Wait, but the problem is about making 5000 bottles, each 400g. So first, I should find the total mass of all the product (which is the soda-lime glass) needed. But wait, the problem doesn't mention any byproducts, so I assume all the required materials are consumed. 

Wait, but the reaction is Na₂CO₃ + CaCO₃ +6 SiO₂ → products, so the amount of SiO₂ is directly tied to the amount of reaction. 

So the question is, how much Na₂CO₃, CaCO₃, and SiO₂ are needed to make 5000 bottles? But wait, the question says how many grams of sand (SiO₂) are required. So I just need to find how much SiO₂ is needed given the number of bottles.

Wait, but the question says that each bottle has a certain weight. Wait, the equation is given, but I'm not sure if the equation is per mole or per bottle. Let me think. The equation is a balanced chemical reaction, so the stoichiometric ratios are per mole of reaction. So perhaps I need to calculate the number of moles of reaction needed to make all the bottles, then multiply by 6 (since each reaction uses 6 moles of SiO₂) and convert that to grams.

But wait, the bottles are made from the products of the reaction. Each bottle is 400g, but the total mass of the products would be the sum of the masses of Na₂O·CaO and CO₂, but wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each bottle is made from the product, and each product has a certain mass? No, I think the question is more straightforward. It's probably about the stoichiometry between the reactants and the product, and then how much product is needed for the total mass of the bottles.

Alternatively, perhaps each mole of reaction produces a certain mass of product, but I think the question is more about the mole ratios. Maybe the question is considering that each mole of reaction produces 2 CO₂, but perhaps each bottle is made up of the product, which is (Na₂O·CaO·6SiO₂). But I don't think that's the case here. The problem says each bottle is 400 grams, but I'm not sure if that refers to the mass of the products or the mass of the glass. Hmm, perhaps that's a red herring. Maybe the question is simply about the stoichiometric amount of SiO₂ needed to make the required amount of soda-lime glass (i.e., the products), but I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, perhaps I should approach this as follows: calculate the total mass of soda-lime glass needed, then find out how much sand is required based on the stoichiometry from the reaction.

Wait, but the reaction produces 2 CO₂ per mole of reaction. Did I get that right? Let me look at the equation again. Oh, the equation is Na₂CO₃ + CaCO₃ +6SiO₂ → Na₂O·CaO·6SiO₂ + 2CO₂. So each mole of reaction produces 2 moles of CO₂. But the question is about the mass of the product. Or perhaps each mole of reaction produces a certain mass of soda-lime glass. Let's compute that.

But first, perhaps I should calculate the moles of reaction needed to produce enough soda-lime glass to fill the bottles. Each bottle is 0.4 kg, and there are 5000 bottles. So total mass is 5000 * 0.4 kg = 2000 kg = 2,000,000 grams. Wait, that's a lot. But wait, the soda-lime glass's mass isn't given directly. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces a certain number of moles of CO₂ for each mole of reaction. Since each reaction produces 2 CO₂ per mole, the amount of CO₂ produced is 2 moles per reaction. So, for each mole of reaction, 2 moles CO₂ are formed.

But the problem is about the amount of sand required. Since the reaction requires 6 moles of SiO₂ per mole of reaction, the mass of sand needed would be 6 times the moles of reaction required.

So, the first step is to find out how much soda-lime glass (Na₂O·CaO·6SiO₂) is needed to make 5000 bottles. Wait, but I don't have the mass of each bottle of soda-lime glass. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe each bottle's weight is 400 grams, which is the mass of the product. But the problem doesn't specify. Or perhaps it's a typo, and the actual product is the CO₂, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire reaction as the product, and the mass of each product is determined by the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try taking another approach. The problem gives the mass of each bottle as 400 grams. The number of bottles is 5000. So total mass is 5000 * 0.4 kg = 2000 kg, which is 2,000,000 grams. 

Wait, but I don't know if each bottle's product is 400 grams, so the total product mass is 5000 * 400 g = 2,000,000 g = 2000 kg. But the reaction's stoichiometry tells me that for each mole of reaction, 2 moles CO₂ are produced. But I'm not given the molar mass, so perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about the amount of sand required for the entire reaction, assuming that all the bottles are made from the products.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molar masses. Let's compute the molar masses of the reactants and products.

Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃):

Na: 23 g/mol

CO₃: 60 g/mol (12 + 3*16 = 60)

So Na₂CO₃: 23*2 +60 = 46 +60=106 g/mol.

CaCO₃:

Ca:40, C:12, O:16*3=48. So 40+12+48=100 g/mol.

6 SiO₂:

Si:28.09 *6 (since Si is about 28.09 g/mol) ≈ 168.54 g/mol.

O:16 *2 *6= 192 g/mol.

Wait, no. Wait, 6 SiO₂. Each SiO₂ is 60 g/mol (28.09 + 16*2= 60). So 6 *60 = 360 g/mol.

So the total reactant mass per reaction is:

Na₂CO₃ (106) + CaCO₃ (100) + 6 SiO₂ (360) = 106+100+360 =566 g per mole of reaction.

The product is Na₂O·CaO·6SiO₂. Let's compute the molar mass.

Na₂O: Na:23*2=46, O:16 → 46+16=62.

CaO: 40 +16=56.

6SiO₂: 6*60=360.

So product is 62 +56 +360 = 478 g per mole.

So for each mole of reaction, the total mass of product is 478 g.

But the reaction produces 6 moles of SiO₂, which is 6 *60=360 g. Each mole of reaction produces 2 moles CO₂, which is 2 *44=88 g. So total CO₂ per reaction is 88 g.

Wait, but the problem is about the mass of the products, not the reaction. So for each mole of reaction, 478 g of product is formed.

But the question is about how much sand is needed. Each mole of reaction requires 6 moles of SiO₂, so the mass of sand required is 6 * (60 g/mol) = 360 g per mole of reaction.

But wait, the reaction uses 6 moles of SiO₂ per mole of reaction. So the mass of sand per mole of reaction is 360 grams.

The total reaction needed is based on the total product mass required. How much product do we need to make 5000 bottles, each of 400 g?

Wait, perhaps each product (soda-lime glass) is 400 grams per bottle. For 5000 bottles, the total product mass is 5000 *400 g =2,000,000 grams.

Wait, but each mole of reaction produces 478 grams of product. So the number of moles of reaction needed is (2e6 g) / (478 g/mol) ≈ 4185.04 mol.

Wait, 2e6 grams is 2,000,000 grams. So 2e6 /478 ≈ 4184.528 mol. Let me compute that: 4184.528 *60 (since each mole of reaction uses 6 moles of SiO₂, and each mole is 60g) → 4184.528 *60 = 251,071.68 grams of sand.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 2.51 ×10^4 g, which is 25,100 grams. But my calculation gives about 251,071, which is in the order of 250,000, which isn't matching any options. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused the total mass of the product. Let me check the problem again. Oh! Wait, the question says each bottle is 400 g. So 5000 x400 = 2,000,000 grams. So the product mass is 2,000,000 g.

But each mole of reaction produces 478 g of product. So moles needed = 2e6 / 478 ≈ 4184.528 mol.

Each mol uses 6 *60 = 360 g of SiO₂. So total sand needed is 4184.528 *360 = let's compute that.

4184.528 *300 = 1,255,358.4

4184.528 *60= 251,071.68

Total: 1,255,358.4 +251,071.68 =1,506,430.08 grams ≈1.506e6 g. So around 1.51 ×10^6 g.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.51 ×10^6 g. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check the stoichiometry.

The reaction is Na₂CO₃ + CaCO₃ +6SiO₂ → Na₂O·CaO·6SiO₂ +2CO₂.

Each mole of reaction produces 2 moles of CO₂. So if the reaction is run n times, the total CO₂ produced is 2n moles. But the mass of CO₂ depends on its molar mass (about 44 g/mol) and the number of moles. However, the problem is about the mass of the product, which is Na₂O·CaO·6SiO₂. So perhaps the product's molar mass is 478 g/mol, as I calculated earlier. So for each mole of reaction, 478 grams are produced.

Thus, for 2,000,000 grams of product, moles needed is 2e6 /478 ≈4184.528 mol. Each reaction uses 6 moles of SiO₂, so mass is 4184.528 *6 *60 g.

Wait, 6 *60 is 360. So 4184.528 *360 = 1,506,430 g. That's about 1.506e6 grams, which is 1.51 ×1e6 g, which is option D.

But wait, the options were:

A: 1.0 ×1e6

B:3.5 ×1e5

C:5.0 ×1e5

D:1.51 ×1e6

E:2.51e4

So the correct answer would be D.

To determine the mass of sand (SiO₂) required to make 5000 wine bottles, each weighing 400 g, we analyze the chemical reaction:

\[
\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{CaCO}_3 + 6\text{SiO}_2 \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{O}\cdot\text{CaO}\cdot6\text{SiO}_2 + 2\text{CO}_2
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Total Mass of Soda-Lime Glass Needed**:  
   Each bottle is 400 g, and there are 5000 bottles.  
   \[
   \text{Total mass} = 5000 \times 400 = 2,000,000 \, \text{g} = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}
   \]

2. **Molar Masses**:  
   - Sodium carbonate (\(\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3\)): \(106 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
   - Calcium carbonate (\(\text{CaCO}_3\)): \(100 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
   - Sand (\(\text{SiO}_2\)): \(60 \, \text{g/mol}\)  

   The reaction requires 6 moles of \(\text{SiO}_2\) per mole of reaction.  

3. **Molar Mass of Soda-Lime Glass (Product)**:  
   The product \(\text{Na}_2\text{O}\cdot\text{CaO}\cdot6\text{SiO}_2\) has a molar mass of:  
   \[
   62 + 56 + 360 = 478 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

4. **Moles of Reaction Needed**:  
   The total mass of the product is \(2 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}\).  
   Using the molar mass of the product:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of reaction} = \frac{2 \times 10^6}{478} \approx 4184.53 \, \text{mol}
   \]

5. **Mass of Sand Needed**:  
   Each mole of reaction requires 6 moles of \(\text{SiO}_2\), and each mole of \(\text{SiO}_2\) weighs \(60 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   \text{Mass of sand} = 4184.53 \times 6 \times 60 = 1,506,430 \, \text{g} \approx 1.51 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The mass of sand required to make 5000 wine bottles is approximately \(1.51 \times 10^6 \, \text{g}\), which corresponds to option **D**.
