Okay, so I have this question here about what "Hare" refers to in the context of people's ideals. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says, "Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without regard for whether people’s interests are pursued by them as..." and then gives a list of options. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact term, but I think I remember something about "Hare" in social theory. 

From what I remember, "Hare" is associated with the term "pragmatist" or maybe "irrationalist." Wait, let me think. The pragmatists are a group of thinkers who emphasize the practical effects of ideas. They focus on how ideas help people achieve reality and solve problems. So if someone is a pragmatist, they would probably support policies that benefit society, not just their personal interests. 

Alternatively, I think the "Hare" movement has something to do with radicals. The Hare movement, I believe, was a social movement in the 1960s in the UK, but I'm not sure if that's the cause of confusion here. Wait, no, "Hare" in that context is more about radicalism in the sense of individuals who are more radical, like the Hare effect, which refers to people who are overly radical and don't pay attention to the consequences of their actions. 

Hmm, wait, the question is about people who endorse ideals without considering the interests of others. So, let me look at the options again. 

Option B: irrationalists. I'm not sure if that's the term. I think irrationalists are those who believe in an irrational or non-physical reality. They might not follow the conventional rationalistic approach. 

Option D: non-pragmatists. Non-pragmatists don't believe that ideas have practical effects. So they might hold that ideas don't necessarily lead to reality. This seems a bit like pragmatists, but the opposite. 

Option E: radicals. Radicals are often those who are more extreme and see things in a different way than mainstream. But does that fit with the idea of endorsement based on personal ideals without considering others' interests? 

Wait, another thought: the term "Hare" is sometimes used in a different context. I think in social media, "Hare" is a slang term meaning someone who is overly enthusiastic and doesn't pay attention to the cause. So, if someone is a Hare, they might support their own interests without considering others' needs. 

But wait, the question mentions that the Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without considering whether people’s interests are pursued by them. So, it's about their personal ideals, not others' interests. 

Looking at the options, I'm trying to find the term that fits. The Hare movement is about radicalism, but I'm not sure if that's the right term here. Alternatively, I'm trying to recall if "Hare" is a term for irrationalists. 

Wait, I'm confusing terms. Let me think again. The pragmatist is someone who believes in the practical effects of ideas. So, if someone is a pragmatist, they would support policies that have real benefits. So, if a pragent supports an idea because it helps society, they might endorse an ideal without considering others' interests. 

Looking at the options, the term "pragmatists" isn't listed. The options are A to H, so I have to choose from those. 

Option C: purists. Purists are the people who stick with old beliefs, so they stick with an old ideal. That doesn't fit because the question is about endorsement without regard to others' interests. 

Option D: non-pragmatists. These are people who don't believe in the practical effects of ideas. So they might support an ideal just because it's a good idea, without considering its practical outcomes. That matches the description here. 

Wait, wait. So the question is about people who support an ideal without considering others' interests. So non-pragmatists support an idea because it's good, regardless of its practicality. So yes, that would make them non-pragmatists. 

Alternatively, the Hare movement is about radicalism in general, but the term I'm looking for is non-pragmatists. So the answer should be option D: non-pragmatists.

The term "Hare" in this context refers to people who endorse ideals without considering whether others' interests are pursued. This aligns with the concept of non-pragmatists, who believe in the good of an idea without evaluating its practical effects.
