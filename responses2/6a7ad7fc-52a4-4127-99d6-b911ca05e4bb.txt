Question:

A contractor has found through experience that the low bid for a job (excluding his own bid) is a random variable that is uniformly dis-tributed, over the interval ( 3c / 4 , 2c) where c is the contractor's cost estimate (no profit or loss) of the job. If profit is defined as zero if the contractor does not get the job (his bid is greater than the low bid) and as the difference between his bid and the cost estimate c if he gets the job, what should he bid, in terms of c, in order to maximize his expected profit?

Options:

A: k = (7c / 4)
B: k = (3c / 2)
C: k = (3c / 4)
D: k = (c / 3)
E: k = (4c / 3)
F: k = c
G: k = (2c / 3)
H: k = (5c / 4)
I: k = (5c / 3)
J: k = (c / 2)

Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't want to make any mistakes. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

The problem is about a contractor trying to determine the optimal bid to maximize expected profit. The setup says that the low bid for the job (excluding their own bid) is a uniformly distributed random variable between 3c/4 and 2c. c is the contractor's estimated cost, so there's no profit or loss there. 

Hmm, wait. The profit isn't just about getting the job, right? It's defined as zero if the contractor doesn't get the job, which would mean their bid is higher than the low bid. And if they do get the job, the profit is the difference between their bid and the cost estimate c. So, the profit function is piecewise: zero if their bid k is higher than the low bid, and (k - c) if k is lower than or equal to the low bid.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Wait, the low bid is a random variable, let's denote it as X, which is uniformly distributed between 3c/4 and 2c. So, the contractor's bid is k. If k is greater than X, they get the job and profit is k - c. If k is less than or equal to X, they don't get the job and profit is zero. 

So, the expected profit E[Profit] is equal to the probability that k <= X times (k - c), because profit is zero otherwise. Since X is uniform, the probability that k <= X is the length of the interval [k, 2c] divided by the total interval length [3c/4, 2c]. 

Wait, the total interval length is 2c - 3c/4. Let me compute that: 2c is 8c/4, minus 3c/4 is 5c/4. So, the total range is 5c/4. The length of [k, 2c] is 2c - k. So, the probability is (2c - k)/(5c/4) = (8(2c -k))/(5c). Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me compute it again. 

Wait, the probability that X >= k is equal to (2c - k) / (2c - 3c/4). Wait, the interval is from 3c/4 to 2c. So, the length is 2c - 3c/4 = (8c/4 - 3c/4) = 5c/4. The length of [k, 2c] is 2c - k, but only if k <= 2c. But since k is the bid, and the maximum X can be is 2c, then as long as k <= 2c, which it will be, because the bid can't be higher than 2c since the low bid is up to 2c. Wait, but what if the bid is higher than 2c? Well, in reality, the bid can't be higher than the maximum, but the problem states that the low bid is in (3c/4, 2c), so the maximum is 2c. So, if k is higher than 2c, they get the job, but since the maximum X is 2c, so if k is 2c or higher, they get the job. But wait, wait, the problem says that the low bid is in (3c/4, 2c), which probably means that the maximum X can be is 2c, so if the contractor's bid k is equal to or higher than X, they get the job. So, if k is between 3c/4 and 2c, they could get the job. If k is higher than 2c, they also get the job, but wait, that's beyond X's maximum. So, the profit would be k - c in all cases where k is less than or equal to X, and zero otherwise. Wait, but isn't X's maximum 2c? So, if the contractor's bid k is higher than 2c, but that can't happen because the maximum X is 2c. So, actually, the maximum X is 2c. So, for any bid k, if k <= 2c, then the probability of getting the job is (2c -k)/(5c/4) = (8(2c -k))/(5c). 

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me make it clear. The expectation is calculated as follows:

E[Profit] = P(k <= X) * (k - c) + P(k > X) * 0 = P(k <= X)*(k - c).

Because if k > X, profit is zero. So, the expected profit is just the probability that X is less than or equal to k multiplied by (k - c).

Since X is uniform over [3c/4, 2c], the probability P(X <= k) is equal to (k - 3c/4) / (2c - 3c/4), provided that k is within the interval. If k is less than 3c/4, then P(X <= k) is zero. If k is greater than 2c, P(X <=k) is 1. But in our case, the contractor's bid k can be anything, but since X is between 3c/4 and 2c, the maximum X is 2c. So, if the contractor is trying to choose a bid k, what if k is higher than 2c? Then P(X <=k )=1, leading to expected profit (k -c). But wait, is a bid higher than 2c allowed? Because the problem says that the low bid is between 3c/4 and 2c, so perhaps the contractor's own bid can be anything, but if it's higher than 2c, they get the job, and profit is k - c. But is there any upper limit on the bid? Because the problem doesn't specify, but in practice, contractors can't bid infinitely. But perhaps in this problem, the optimal k is somewhere in the interval, or maybe beyond.

Wait, but let's think about it. Let's denote k as the bid. The expected profit is (k - c) * (probability that X <=k). So, the probability P(X <=k) is (k - 3c/4) / (2c - 3c/4) if 3c/4 <=k <=2c. If k < 3c/4, P=0. If k>2c, P=1.

But wait, the problem says that the low bid is a random variable X, which is between 3c/4 and 2c. So, the contractor's bid k can be anything. But let's think about the expected profit.

So, E[Profit] = (k - c) * (probability that X <=k ).

But wait, what's the probability that X <=k? If k is less than 3c/4, it's 0. If k is between 3c/4 and 2c, it's (k - 3c/4)/(2c - 3c/4). If k >2c, it's 1.

So, the expected profit function is:

E(k) = (k - c) * [ (k - 3c/4) / (5c/4) ) ].

Wait, because 2c - 3c/4 = 8c/4 -3c/4 =5c/4.

So, E(k) = (k - c) * [ (k - 3c/4) * 4/(5c) ) ].

Simplify that expression:

E(k) = (k - c) * (4(k - 3c/4))/(5c) )

Let me compute this step by step.

E(k) = (k - c) * [4(k - 3c/4)]/(5c)
= [4(k - c)(k - 3c/4)] / (5c)

Now, to find the optimal k, we need to maximize E(k) with respect to k. But we have to consider the domain of k. Since X can be as low as 3c/4 and as high as 2c, but the contractor's bid can be anything. However, for k <=3c/4, E(k)=0 (since the probability is zero). For k >2c, E(k) = (k -c) since the probability is 1. So, to find the maximum, we can look for k where 3c/4 <k <2c.

So, we'll maximize E(k) for 3c/4 <k <2c.

Let me rewrite E(k):

E(k) = [4(k - c)(k - 3c/4)]/(5c)

Let me expand the numerator:

(k - c)(k - 3c/4) = k² - (3c/4)k - c k + (3c²/4)
= k² - (7c/4)k + (3c²/4)

So, E(k) becomes [4(k² - (7c/4)k + 3c²/4)]/(5c)
= (4k² -7c k + 3c² )/(5c)

Now, to find the maximum of E(k), we can take the derivative with respect to k, set it to zero, and solve.

dE/dk = [ (8k -7c) *5c - (4k² -7c k +3c²) *0 ] / (5c)^2 ?

Wait, no. Let me compute the derivative correctly.

E(k) = [4k² -7c k +3c² ]/(5c)

The derivative E’(k) is (8k -7c) / (5c)

Set E’(k)=0: 8k -7c =0 → 8k=7c → k=7c/(8) → 7c/8.

Wait, 7c/8 is 0.875c. But wait, the options given for k are in certain fractions. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A: 7c/4 → 1.75c

B: 3c/2 → 1.5c

C:3c/4 → 0.75c

D:c/3 → ~0.333c

E:4c/3 → ~1.333c

F:c →1c

G:2c/3 → ~0.666c

H:5c/4 →1.25c

I:5c/3 → ~1.666c

J:c/2 →0.5c

Wait, our calculation gave k=7c/8=0.875c, which isn't one of the options. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me go back. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion of E(k). Let me check.

Wait, E(k) = (k - c) * [4(k - 3c/4)] / (5c)

Wait, [k -c] multiplied by [4(k -3c/4)] is [ (k -c)(k -3c/4) ] multiplied by 4/(5c).

Wait, perhaps I should write it as E(k) = [4(k - c)(k - 3c/4)]/(5c)

Alternatively, maybe I should expand (k - c)(k -3c/4).

Wait, (k -c)(k -3c/4) = k² - (3c/4 + c)k + (c)(3c/4)

= k² - (7c/4)k + 3c²/4.

So, E(k) becomes [4k² -7c k +3c² ]/(5c) → (4k²)/(5c) - (7k)/(5) + 3c/5.

So, E(k) = (4/5)(k²/c) - (7/5)k + (3c/5).

To find the maximum, take derivative:

E’(k) = (8k)/(5c) -7/5.

Set to zero:

(8k)/(5c) -7/5=0 → 8k/(5c)=7/5 → 8k =7c → k=7c/8.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So, k=7c/8. Looking at the options, that's not listed. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the expected profit is not just the probability times (k -c), but perhaps that profit is only when k <=X. Wait, no, because if k > X, then profit is zero. So, the expected profit is (k -c) * P(X >=k) because if X >=k, you get the job and get profit k-c. So, the expected profit is (k-c) multiplied by the probability that X >=k.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because earlier I thought P(X <=k) gave the probability of getting the job, but now I think it's P(X >=k) for the profit.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify: If X is the low bid, and the contractor's bid is k. If k <=X, the contractor gets the job and profit is k -c. If k >X, they don't get the job and profit is zero. So, the expected profit is the probability that X >=k multiplied by (k - c).

So, E[Profit]= P(X >=k) * (k -c). 

But wait, for X between 3c/4 and 2c, so when k is less than 3c/4, P(X >=k) is 1. When k is between 3c/4 and 2c, it's (2c -k)/(5c/4). When k is greater than 2c, it's 1.

Wait, so in the region where 3c/4 <=k <=2c, the probability is (2c -k)/(5c/4) = (8(2c -k))/(5c).

So, E(k) = [ (2c -k) *8 ]/(5c) * (k -c).

Wait, perhaps I got this wrong earlier. Let me correct this.

E(k)= P(X >=k) * (k -c) → which is [ (2c -k) * 8/(5c) ] * (k -c ), since for 3c/4 <=k <=2c, P(X >=k) = (2c -k)/(5c/4) = (8(2c -k))/(5c).

So, E(k)= [8(2c -k)/(5c)] * (k -c).

So, E(k)= [8(k -c)(2c -k)]/(5c).

Let me write this as (8/5c) * (k -c)(2c -k).

Now, let's expand the numerator: (k -c)(2c -k) = 2c k -k² -2c² +c k = 3c k -k² -2c².

So, E(k)=8/5c * (3c k -k² -2c²) =8/5c*( -k² +3c k -2c² )

Hmm, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write E(k) as (8(k -c)(2c -k))/(5c).

Let me compute this as a function:

E(k) = [8(k -c)(2c -k)]/(5c)

Let me compute the numerator: (k -c)(2c -k) = k*(2c -k) -c*(2c -k) = 2c k -k² -2c² + c k = (2c k +c k) -k² -2c² → 3c k -k² -2c².

So, E(k) = [8(3c k -k² -2c²)]/(5c) = [24 c k -8k² -16c² ]/(5c) = [24k/(5) - (8k²)/(5c) -32c/(5) ]

Wait, maybe it's better to take the derivative as a function of k.

E(k) = (8/5c) * ( -k² +3c k -2c² )

So, E(k) = (8/5c) * (-k² +3c k -2c² )

The derivative E’(k) is (8/5c) * (-2k +3c )

Set derivative to zero for maximum:

-2k +3c =0 → 2k=3c →k= (3c)/2.

Wait, 3c/2 is option B, which is 3c/2.

Wait, but that's one of the options. But earlier, I thought that the optimal k was 7c/8, but that was based on a different assumption. Hmm. So, where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says that the low bid is a random variable over (3c/4, 2c). So, X is uniform over 3c/4 to 2c.

The contractor's bid is k. If k is greater than X, profit is zero. If k is less than or equal to X, profit is (k -c). So, the expected profit is E[Profit] = E[ (k -c) * I(X >=k) ] where I is the indicator function.

But wait, for k within the range of X's possible values, the probability that X >=k is [2c -k]/(5c/4) = (8(2c -k))/(5c). So, E[Profit] = (8/5c) (2c -k) (k -c) → E(k)= (8/5c)( (2c -k)(k -c) )

So, the function to maximize is (8/5c)( (2c -k)(k -c) )

Let me compute (2c -k)(k -c) → (2c -k)(k -c ) =2c k -2c² -k² +c k =3c k -k² -2c² → which is what I had earlier.

So, E(k)= (8/5c)( -k² +3c k -2c² )

Now, taking the derivative with respect to k:

dE/dk = (8/5c)( -2k +3c ) → set equal to zero:

-2k +3c=0 → 2k=3c →k= (3c)/2.

So, the optimal k is 3c/2. Which is option B.

Wait, but earlier when I thought I made a mistake, I thought the optimal k was 7c/8, but that was under the wrong assumption.

So, the correct answer should be option B: 3c/2.

Wait, but perhaps I should check the expected profit at k=3c/2 and see if it's indeed the maximum.

Compute E(k) at k=3c/2:

E(k)= (8/5c) * ( (2c - 3c/2) (3c/2 -c) )

Compute each term:

2c -3c/2 = (4c -3c)/2 =c/2.

3c/2 -c =c/2.

So, (c/2)(c/2)=c²/4.

So, E(k)= (8/5c) * (c²/4 )= (8/5c)*(c²/4 )= (8 * c²)/(5c *4 )= (8c)/(20) = c/2. So, E(k)=c/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the expected profit at k=3c/2 is c/2.

What about at k=2c? What would the expected profit be?

E(k)= (8/5c) * ( (2c -2c)(2c -c) )= (8/5c)* (0 * c)=0.

So, at k=2c, the expected profit is zero.

What about at k=3c/4?

E(k)= (8/5c) * ( (2c -3c/4)(3c/4 -c) )

Compute each term:

2c -3c/4=5c/4.

3c/4 -c= -c/4 → but since we take absolute value (since the expected profit is (k-c) multiplied by probability that X <=k, but in reality, the term inside the product is (k-c) which for k=3c/4 is negative, but since X can be less than or equal to k, perhaps for k=3c/4, the expected profit is zero, because (k-c) is negative, but only if X is less than or equal to k. Wait, but for k=3c/4, the probability that X <=k is zero, since X ranges from 3c/4 to 2c. So, the expected profit is zero at k=3c/4.

Hmm, but what about for k= 7c/8 (the previous calculation)? Let's compute E(k) at that point.

k=7c/8.

Compute (2c -k)=2c -7c/8=16c/8 -7c/8=9c/8.

(k -c)=7c/8 -8c/8= -c/8.

So, (k -c) (2c -k)= (-c/8)(9c/8)= -9c²/64.

So, E(k)= (8/5c) * (-9c²/64 )= (8 * (-9c² ))/(5c *64 )= (-72c²)/(320c )= (-72c)/(320 )= (-9c)/40.

So, E(k)= -9c/40, which is negative. So, the expected profit is negative, indicating that the contractor would not choose that bid. So, the maximum expected profit is at k=3c/2 (since that gives E(k)=c/2), and that's higher than the expected profit at any other k.

Wait, so the correct answer is option B: 3c/2.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.

The problem is: the contractor's profit is (k-c) times the probability that X >=k. The expected profit is the integral of that function over all possible k of the probability density. Or, more accurately, the expected profit is the integral over k of [ (k-c) * P(X >=k) ] dk, since X is a random variable.

We found that the optimal k is 3c/2, giving the maximum expected profit of c/2.

So, the correct answer is option B: 3c/2.
</think>

The problem involves a contractor bidding for a job, where the low bid (X) is uniformly distributed between 3c/4 and 2c. The contractor's bid (k) is compared to X, and profit is determined as follows:

- If k ≤ X: Profit is k - c, and the probability of getting the job is 1.
- If k > X: Profit is 0, and the probability of getting the job is 0.

The expected profit (E[Profit]) is calculated as the integral of the profit function over all possible k, weighted by the probability density of X. After analyzing the expected profit as a function of k, we find that the optimal bid k is 3c/2, which maximizes the expected profit of c/2.

ANSWER: B
