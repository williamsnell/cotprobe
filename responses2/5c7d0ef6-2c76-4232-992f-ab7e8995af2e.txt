Okay, so I have this question here about selecting 5 students out of 6, and I need to figure out how many ways that can be done. Hmm, I remember something about combinations and permutations from my math class. Let me think.

Wait, combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, right? Like, if I pick students A, B, C, D, E and I'm choosing 5, the order in which I select them doesn't matter. So it's about choosing a subset without considering the sequence.

The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n-k)!). So in this case, n is 6 and k is 5. Let me write that out: 6! / (5! * (6-5)!).

Calculating that, 6! is 720, 5! is 120, and (6-5)! is 1!. So substituting, it's 720/(120 * 1) = 720/120 = 6. So there are 6 ways.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that selecting 5 out of 6 is the same as leaving out 1. So there's 6 choices for who to leave out, which directly gives 6 possible groups. That matches what I calculated earlier.

Looking at the options, option F is 6. So the answer should be F.

The number of ways to select 5 students from 6 is given by combinations. Using the formula for combinations:

\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 5 \):

\[
C(6, 5) = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{720}{120 \cdot 1} = 6
\]

Thus, there are 6 ways, corresponding to option F.

Answer: F
