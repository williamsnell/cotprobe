Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the cost of running a motor. Let me see if I can figure it out. Alright, the problem says the cost is 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. I need to find out how much it costs to run the motor for 2 hours, and the motor draws 5 amperes from a 120-volt line. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that power is related to voltage, current, and resistance. Oh right, the formula is P equals V multiplied by I. So voltage is 120 volts, current is 5 amperes. Let me calculate that. P = 120 * 5 = 600 watts. Oh, wait, 600 watts. But the question wants it in kilowatts, so that's 0.6 kilowatts.

Power in kilowatts is 0.6 kW. Now, power is also equal to energy over time. So energy (which is what we're calculating, but in terms of cost) can be found by multiplying power by time. The time here is 2 hours. So energy = 0.6 kW * 2 hours = 1.2 kilowatt-hours.

Wait, so the energy used is 1.2 kWh. Now, the cost is 5 cents per kWh. So the total cost is 1.2 * 5 cents. Let me do the math. 1 times 5 is 5, and 0.2 times 5 is 1. So 5 + 1 = 6 cents. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, 1.2 times 5 is 6? Because 1 *5=5, 0.2*5=1, so 5+1=6 cents. So that would be 6 cents.

Looking at the options, option E is 6 cents. So the answer should be E. But wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations?

Power: 120V *5A =600W. 600W is 0.6kW. Time is 2h. So 0.6kW *2h = 1.2 kWh. Cost is 1.2 *5 =6 cents. Yep, that's correct. So option E is the right answer.
</think>

The cost to run the motor for 2 hours is calculated by first determining the power consumed. Using P = V * I, the power is 120V * 5A = 600W, which is 0.6 kW. The energy consumed is then P * t = 0.6 kW * 2 h = 1.2 kWh. At a cost of 5 cents per kWh, the total cost is 1.2 * 5 = 6 cents. The correct answer is E.

Answer: E
