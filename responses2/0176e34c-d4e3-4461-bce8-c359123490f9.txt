Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about coloring the edges of a complete graph with n vertices using two colors, red and blue. The question is asking for the smallest n that guarantees either a 4-clique in red or a 4-clique in blue. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with Ramsey theory. Let me think.

Ramsey numbers, right? The Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest number of vertices such that all undirected colorings of the edges contain a red clique of size m or a blue clique of size n. In this case, m and n are both 4. So we're looking for R(4,4). 

Wait, what's the known Ramsey number for R(4,4)? I think it's 18. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Let me try to recall. I remember that R(3,3) is 6, R(4,4) is 18. Oh yeah, that's correct. So the smallest n is 18. Let me check the options. Option J is 18, so that's the answer.

The problem asks for the smallest n that guarantees a monochromatic 4-clique, which is the Ramsey number R(4,4). This is known to be 18.

Answer: J
