Question:

Mr. Haskell has decided to buy a rental property. The building costs $50,000 and the land costs $30,000. The annual rent income is estimated to be $10,450 and the annual expense, $3,200. Mr. Haskell plans to depreciate the building by the straight line method over 40 years. Mr. Haskell wants to choose the best of three investment plans. Plan A Pay the full $80,000 from personal account. Plan B Borrow $30,000 and pay $50,000 from personal account. Rate of interest is 4(1/2)%. Plan C Borrow $60,000 and pay $20,000 from personal account. Rate of interest is 5 (1/4)%. If the tax rate is 40%, which investment plan has the highest rate of return?

Options:

A: Plan B, if the interest rates drop to 3%
B: Plan A, if the tax rate decreases to 30%
C: Plan A
D: Plan C, assuming rental income increases by 5% annually
E: Plan C
F: None of the plans
G: Plan B
H: Plan C, if additional tax deductions are available for interest paid
I: Plan A, with a government grant covering 10% of the initial investment
J: Plan B, with an additional private investor contributing $10,000

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this investment planning problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Mr. Haskell is buying a rental property. The building costs $50k and land $30k, so total upfront is $80k. He's planning to use plan A, which requires paying the full $80k from his personal account. Plan B borrows $30k, so he pays $50k from personal and uses $30k from the bank. The annual rent is $10,450, and annual expenses are $3,200. He's using straight-line depreciation over 40 years on the building.

Tax rate is 40%, and there's a 4.5% interest rate for Plan A and 5.25% for Plan C. The question is which plan has the highest ROI. The options are A to J, each suggesting different scenarios.

Hmm. So I need to calculate the return on investment for each plan under their respective conditions. Let's break it down.

First, for Plan A: He's using the full $80k, so there's no personal contribution. So his net investment is $80k. But wait, he has to consider the interest. So his cost of capital would be the interest plus any other factors?

Wait, no. The problem is about comparing different investment plans. Each plan's return depends on how much he can get back from the rental income after paying expenses, taxes, and interest.

Wait, but the question is which plan has the highest rate of return. So I need to compute the ROI for each plan under their respective conditions.

Let me structure the approach:

1. Calculate the net cash flow after considering depreciation, rent, expenses, and taxes.
2. Determine the return on investment (ROI) for each plan, considering the initial investment and the net cash flows.
3. Compare the ROI under different scenarios.

But wait, the problem states that the interest rates for Plan A and C are 4.5% and 5.25%, respectively. But for Plan B, the rate is 4.5% (since it's borrowing $30k with rate 4.5%). Similarly, for Plan C, it's 5.25%. 

But the options suggest that in some cases, the interest rate is different. For example, Option A says Plan B's rate drops to 3%. So I need to adjust for that.

The problem is that without knowing the exact parameters, I have to compute each plan's ROI under their respective rates.

Let me outline the steps for each plan:

**Plan A:**
- Initial investment: $80k (all from personal account)
- Annual rental income: $10,450
- Annual expenses: $3,200
- Depreciation: Straight line over 40 years. Since the building cost is $50k, annual depreciation is $50k /40 = $1,250.
- Tax rate: 40%
- Interest rate: 4.5% (because it's Plan A)

So the net cash flow after interest and taxes:

First, calculate the pre-tax cash flow.

Wait, perhaps I should model this step by step.

Net cash flow each year = (Rents - Expenses) * (1 - tax rate) + depreciation * tax rate.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The cash flows from the property should be considered as rental income, less expenses, and less taxes. The depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it's added back in as an asset.

So:

Net operating income (NOI) before tax is (Rents - Expenses) = $10,450 - $3,200 = $7,250.

Depreciation is $1,250, which is a non-cash expense. So when calculating after-tax cash flow, depreciation is added back.

So, after-tax cash flow = (NOI) + depreciation * tax rate.

So, after-tax cash flow = 7250 + (1250 * 0.4) = 7250 + 500= $7750.

But also, the initial investment is $80k. So to find the ROI, it's helpful to compute the internal rate of return (IRR) on the net cash flows.

Wait, the initial investment is a outflow. The annual after-tax cash flow is inflow. So the plan's ROI is the IRR of the initial outlay and the annual inflows.

So, in Plan A, the cash flows are:
- Year 0: -$80,000
- Year 1: +7,750
- Year 2: +7,750
- ... and so on for 40 years.

So the ROI would be the IRR of this series.

Similarly, for Plan B: He borrows $30k, so his net initial investment is $50k (land + personal). Wait, no: Plan B says he borrows $30k and pays $50k from personal. So his net investment is $50k.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says Plan B: Borrow $30k, so his initial investment is $30k in the bank plus $50k from personal. So total initial investment is $80k, same as Plan A? Wait, no, no. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the problem says:

Plan B: Borrow $30k and pay $50k from personal account. So his total initial investment is $50k (land) + $30k (borrowed) = $80k. Wait, but the building is $50k, so the initial investment for the land is $50k. But the plan says he borrows $30k. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the building is $50k, so borrowing $30k would require the land to be $50k, so the initial investment is 50k (land) + 30k (borrowed) = 80k.

But the total initial investment is 80k, same as Plan A. Wait, no, Plan A says full $80k from personal. So Plan B: he uses $30k from personal. So initial investment is 50k (land) + 30k (borrowed) = 80k. Wait, no, no, because the land is $30k, and building is $50k, so the initial investment is 80k.

Wait, no. Because the building is $50k, so he has to pay that. So Plan B: he uses $30k from personal (so he needs to pay 50k in the bank), thus total initial investment is 50k (land) + 30k (borrowed) = 80k. Plan A: he pays all 80k from personal, so 80k.

Wait, that's the same initial investment for both Plan A and B. So that's the first thing to note: same initial investment.

But then, in Plan A, he only pays personal, so taxes might be different. In Plan B, he has to pay interest on the loan, so tax is higher because he's paying interest.

But the question is about calculating the return on investment. Since the initial investment is the same, the ROI would depend on the cash flows beyond the initial investment.

Wait, but the problem says to compare the investment plans. So the ROI is calculated by the internal rate of return (IRR) of the net cash flows, considering the initial investment.

So Plan A: initial investment is 80k, annual cash flow is 7750 (as calculated earlier). Plan B: same initial investment, but annual cash flow is (10,450 - 3,200) + (1,250 * 0.4), which is 7,250 +500=7,750. So same annual cash flow as Plan A.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Because Plan B requires the loan, so the cash flow is different.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me re-calculate.

Plan A:
- Initial investment: $80k (all personal)
- Annual Rents: $10,450
- Annual expenses: $3,200
- Depreciation: $1,250 (straight line over 40 years)
- Tax rate: 40%
- Interest rate: 4.5%

So, the operating cash flow is:

Rents - Expenses = 10,450 - 3,200 = 7,250.

Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it's added back in as tax saving.

So the after-tax cash flow (excluding interest) is:

7,250 + (1,250 * 0.4) = 7,250 + 500 = 7,750.

So each year, he gets 7,750 after tax.

Plan B:
- Initial investment: $50k (land) + $30k (borrowed) = 80k.
But wait, that can't be right because the building is $50k regardless. So the initial investment is 80k.

Wait, no: the initial investment is the cost of the land and the amount borrowed. So Plan B: land is 30k, borrow 30k, so initial investment is 60k? Wait, no, because the building is 50k, so I think the initial investment is the cost of the land plus the amount borrowed. So 30k (land) + 30k (borrowed) = 60k. But wait, that contradicts the earlier thought. But the problem says Plan B: borrow $30k and pay $50k from personal. So initial investment is 30k (land) + 30k (borrowed) = 60k. So this would change the initial investment, making Plan B's initial investment lower than Plan A.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the problem.

Wait, the problem says: Plan B "Borrow $30,000 and pay $50,000 from personal account." So the total initial investment is 50k (land) + 30k (borrowed) = 80k. So same as Plan A.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the building is 50k, so he already has to pay that. So he can't borrow more than 50k. If he borrows 30k, his initial investment is 50k (land) + 30k (borrowed) = 80k. But that's the same as Plan A.

Wait, no. Because Plan A is paying full 80k from personal. So initial investment is 80k in both cases. So Plan B's initial investment is 80k, same as Plan A.

Wait, but Plan B borrows 30k, so he needs to use 30k from personal. So total initial investment is 50 (land) +30 (borrow) = 80k. So same as Plan A. That makes sense.

So the initial investment is the same for both.

The next step is to compute the net cash flow each year and find the ROI for each plan.

But since both have same initial investment and same cash flows, their ROI would be same? Or perhaps not, because plan B includes interest.

Wait, Plan A doesn't have any interest, whereas Plan B does. So Plan B's cash flow is different because he has to pay interest on the loan, which is tax-deductible.

Hmm. So let's model their cash flows.

First, for Plan A:

Initial investment: –80k

Net cash flow each year: 7,750 (after-tax)

For Plan B:

Initial investment: –80k

Net cash flow: 7,750 (after-tax)

Wait, that can't be right. Because Plan B borrows 30k at 4.5% interest, so the interest is 30k *4.5% = 1,350 per year.

But wait, the cash flow for Plan B would be:

Depreciation: $1,250 per year.

Expenses: 3,200.

So operating income before tax is 10,450 -3,200 =7,250.

Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it's added back in.

So after-tax operating income is 7,250 + (1,250 *0.4) =7,250+500=7,750.

But Plan B has to pay the interest on the loan. Wait, no: because Plan B's cash flow is the rental income minus expenses plus depreciation and interest tax savings.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the cash flows more accurately.

Plan B's cash flow each year:

Rents received: 10,450

Expenses: 3,200

Depreciation: 1,250

Interest: 30k *4.5% =1,350.

So, the cash flow is:

10,450 -3,200 =7,250.

Plus depreciation (1,250) and minus interest (1,350) because interest is tax-deductible.

So 7,250 +1,250 -1,350 =7,250 + (1,250-1,350) =7,250 -100=7,150.

So each year, Plan B's net cash flow is 7,150.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because he has to pay interest on the loan, which is not tax-deductible in the same way as depreciation. So instead of saving 40% on the interest, he actually must pay it out, which reduces the net cash flow.

So Plan B's cash flow is lower than Plan A's.

So the cash flows for Plan A:

Year 0: –80k

Year 1-40: +7,750 each year.

For Plan B:

Year 0: –80k

Year 1-40: +7,150 each year.

So, their ROI (IRR) can be calculated based on these cash flows.

The internal rate of return is the rate that makes the NPV zero.

Let me think about how to calculate this.

Let me model the cash flows for each plan and find their respective IRR.

But since the options suggest different scenarios, perhaps we can compute the IRR for each option and see which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate the ROI (return on investment) considering the different interest rates.

Wait, but the question says that each plan has different interest rates. So we have to evaluate each scenario.

Looking back at the question:

The options are about scenarios where Plan A's rate drops to 3%, Plan B's rate drops to 30%, etc.

So for each option, the interest rate is different, and we have to compute the ROI for each plan under that scenario.

Let me go option by option.

Option A: Plan B's rate drops to 3%. So Plan B's interest rate is 3% (but not 4.5%). So Plan A's rate remains 4.5%, Plan B's is 3%.

Wait, but in the options, Plan B's rate is 3%, so Plan B's cash flow is 7,150, but with interest rate 3%.

Wait, but no, the problem says Plan B's rate is 4(1/2)% (4.5%) in the initial scenario, but in Option A, it drops to 3%. So for Plan B, the interest is 3%, so the cash flow would be 7,150 minus 1,250 (depreciation) plus 4.5% interest?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, Plan B's cash flow is calculated as:

After-tax operating income = 7,250 + 1,250 *0.4 =7,750 (if no interest). But since Plan B has a loan, he must pay the interest, which is tax-deductible. So the after-tax cash flow would be:

7,250 + 1,250 (depreciation) - 1,350 (interest). Because the interest is a cash outflow, so it's subtracted.

So 7,250 +1,250 -1,350 = 7,250 -100 =7,150.

So the cash flow is 7,150 per year.

If the interest rate for Plan B is 3%, then the after-tax cash flow is 7,150 + (1,250 *0.3) -1,350*(1 -0.3) ?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the cash flows:

For Plan A, the annual cash flow is 7,750, with interest 4.5%.

For Plan B, the annual cash flow is 7,150, with interest 3%.

But wait, the interest is calculated as the loan amount times the interest rate. So interest is 30k *0.03= 900 per year.

So Plan B's operating income after depreciation is:

10,450 -3,200 =7,250.

Add back depreciation: +1,250.

Subtract interest: 900.

So 7,250 +1,250 -900 = 7,600.

Wait, that seems different from my earlier calculation. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the cash flow as:

(10,450 -3,200) + (1,250 *0.4) - (30,000 *0.03) 

Wait, that makes sense.

So, 7,250 (net operating income before tax) + 500 (tax saving) -900 (interest).

So 7,250 +500 =7,750; 7,750 -900=6,850.

Wait, that's a different result than before.

So Plan B's annual cash flow is 6,850.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express it.

The formula for the annual cash flow is:

(Revenue - Expenses) + Depreciation * tax rate - Loan * interest rate.

Yes, that's correct.

So for Plan B:

Revenue (rents) – expenses (3,200) =7,250.

Depreciation is 1,250. So tax saving is 1,250 * 40% =500.

So after-tax operating income is 7,250 +500 =7,750.

Then, subtract the interest on the loan: 30k *3% =900.

So 7,750 -900=6,850.

So each year, Plan B gets 6,850 after-tax.

Plan A's is 7,750.

So the IRR for Plan A is the rate that makes the NPV zero when the annual cash flow is 7,750.

The IRR for Plan B is the rate that makes the NPV zero when the annual cash flow is 6,850.

So the higher the IRR, the better the plan.

But let's think about the scenario in Option A, where Plan B's rate drops to 3%. So Plan B's annual cash flow is 6,850.

So now, we need to compute the ROI for each plan under the given interest rates.

Wait, the question asks which investment plan has the highest rate of return, considering the scenarios provided in the options.

Let me think: For each option, Plan A and B's interest rates are different, and I have to compute the ROI for each plan.

But since the options are giving specific scenarios, I'll need to compute the ROI for each scenario.

So let's list all the scenarios we'll evaluate:

A: Plan B's rate drops to 3%.

B: Plan A's rate drops to 3%.

C: Plan B's rate drops to 4.5%. (No change, perhaps.)

D: Plan A's rate drops to 3%. (Same as option A.)

E: Plan B's rate drops to 5.25%. (No change.)

F: Plan A's rate drops to 3%. (Same as option A.)

G: Plan B's rate increases to 5%. (No change.)

H: Plan A's rate increases to 4.5%. (No change.)

I: Plan B's rate increases to 5.25%. (No change.)

J: Plan B's rate increases to 5.5%. (No change.)

Wait, but the options don't cover all possibilities, so perhaps I should evaluate each option based on the given scenarios.

Let's proceed step by step.

First, let's compute the ROI for each plan under different scenarios.

We'll have to compute the IRR for each scenario and see which one gives the highest ROI.

But perhaps the problem is simplified and we can compute the ROI as (Cash flow - Investment) / Investment.

Wait, no. Because ROI is usually expressed as (Net Profit / Investment) *100%.

So, for each plan, the net profit is the cash flow after interest and expenses.

But let's proceed.

First, let's compute the initial cash flows.

Initial Investment for both Plan A and B: 80k.

Plan A:

Each year, after-tax cash flow: 7,750.

Plan B:

Each year, after-tax cash flow:6,850.

But perhaps the initial investment is different when considering the loan and interest.

Wait, no. The initial investment is 80k in both cases.

So, Plan A's ROI is the IRR of 7,750 per year, starting at -80k.

Similarly for Plan B, IRR of 6,850 per year.

But the problem is to compute the ROI under different interest rate scenarios.

So let's compute the ROI for each plan under the given scenarios.

Option A: Plan B's rate drops to 3%.

So Plan B now has a lower interest rate, 3%, but the other factors remain as in Plan A.

So Plan A's interest remains 4.5%, Plan B's interest is now 3%.

So Plan A's net cash flow is 7,750, Plan B's is 6,850.

We can compute the ROI for each plan.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the ROI as the IRR, but without knowing the exact IRR, perhaps we can compute it as the IRR formula.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the ROI as the ratio of the cash flow to the initial investment, but that's a simplistic approach and doesn't consider the time value of money.

Wait, but the problem is about the rate of return, which is the same as the internal rate of return.

So, to compute the ROI (internal rate of return) for each plan, we can model the cash flows and find the rate that makes the NPV zero.

But this requires some calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the cash flows as an ordinary annuity and compute the rate using the present value formula.

For Plan A:

The cash flow each year is 7,750, starting at year 1.

Present value of these cash flows is 80k.

So, 80k =7,750 * PVIFA(IRR_A, 40).

Similarly for Plan B:

80k=6,850 * PVIFA(IRR_B,40).

So, I can compute the interest rate by solving for the present value of the cash flows.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ROI for each scenario.

But perhaps the problem is simpler and I can compute the ROI as the cash flows divided by the initial investment, but that's an approximation.

Wait, but the proper approach is to compute the IRR.

But perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ROI as the cash flow divided by initial investment, which is a simple percentage.

So for Plan A's ROI: 7,750 /80k = 9.6875%

Similarly for Plan B's ROI: 6,850 /80k=8.5625%

So under the scenario where Plan B's rate drops to 3%, Plan B's ROI would be 8.56%, which is higher than Plan A's 9.68% in this case.

Wait, but that can't be right, because Plan A's interest rate remains 4.5%, while Plan B's drops to 3%.

So Plan B's scenario:

Initial investment:80k

Cash flow:7,750

So ROI is 7,750 /80k =9.6875%.

But the problem says to compare the investment plans under different interest rate scenarios.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says that the interest rates are assumed to be different, and the options suggest which scenario gives the highest ROI.

So perhaps I'll have to compute the ROI for each scenario.

Let me outline the scenarios again:

Option A: Plan B's rate drops to 3% (so Plan B's interest rate is 3%).

Option B: Plan A's rate drops to 3% (so Plan A's interest rate is 3%).

Option C: Plan B's rate remains at 4.5% (no change).

Option D: Plan A's rate remains at 4.5% (no change).

Option E: Plan B's rate increases to 5.25% (no change).

Option F: Plan A's rate increases to 3% (so Plan A's interest rate is 3%).

Option G: Plan B's rate increases to 5% (no change).

Option H: Plan A's rate increases to 4.5% (no change).

Option I: Plan B's rate increases to 5.25% (no change).

So under each scenario, I'll compute the ROI for each plan.

Let me proceed.

Option A: Plan B's rate drops to 3%.

Plan A's interest remains at 4.5% (4.5%).

So Plan A's cash flow:7,750.

Plan B's cash flow:6,850.

Compute the IRR for each.

But without knowing the IRR, it's hard to compare, but perhaps I can compute the ROI as the cash flow divided by initial investment.

Wait, but perhaps I'll compute the ROI as the cash flow per year divided by the initial investment.

So for Plan A's ROI:7,750/80k=9.6875%.

For Plan B's ROI:6,850/80k=8.5625%.

So in this scenario, Plan A's ROI is higher than Plan B's, despite Plan B's lower interest rate.

Wait, but why?

Because Plan A's cash flow is higher than Plan B's, even though Plan B's interest rate is lower.

Hmm, that's a bit counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps because Plan A's cash flow is 7,750, which is higher than Plan B's 6,850, so even though Plan B has lower interest, Plan A's cash flow is higher.

So in this scenario, Plan A's ROI is higher.

But let's proceed to the next option.

Option B: Plan A's rate drops to 3%.

So Plan A's interest rate drops to 3% (0.03), while Plan B's interest remains at 4.5%.

So Plan A's cash flow is 7,750, Plan B's is 6,850.

Compute the IRR for each.

But again, without knowing the IRR, perhaps I can compare the cash flows.

Plan A's cash flow is higher than Plan B's, so even if Plan A's interest rate drops, Plan A's cash flow is higher.

So in this scenario, Plan A's ROI would be higher than Plan B's.

Wait, but let's think about this.

If the interest rate drops, the cash flow increases because the tax saving is higher.

So even if Plan A's cash flow is lower, perhaps the increase in cash flow outweighs the lower interest.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ROI is calculated as (Cash Flow - Initial Investment)/Initial Investment.

But that's not correct, because it doesn't account for the time value of money.

So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the IRR, which is the discount rate that makes the NPV zero.

But without knowing the exact IRR, perhaps it's hard to compare.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to compare the ROI as (Cash Flow / Initial Investment), which is a simple approximation.

In that case, Plan A's ROI is 9.6875%, Plan B's is 8.5625% when Plan B's rate drops to 3%.

So Plan A would be better.

But in another scenario, perhaps Plan B's ROI would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the best option is when the interest rate is lowest, and the cash flow is highest.

Wait, perhaps the best option is when Plan B's rate drops to 3% (Option A), because Plan A's cash flow is higher, but Plan B's cash flow is lower.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem says that the options are about the scenarios where Plan A's interest rate drops to 3%, Plan B's drops to 4.5%, etc.

So let's proceed for each option.

Option A: Plan B's rate drops to 3%.

So Plan A's interest rate is 4.5%, Plan B's is 3%.

Plan A's cash flow:7,750.

Plan B's cash flow:6,850.

Compute the IRR for each.

But without knowing the exact IRR, perhaps I can compute the ROI as (Cash Flow - Initial Investment)/Initial Investment.

Wait, that's not correct, because it doesn't account for the time value of money.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to compare the cash flows without discounting, so the one with the higher cash flow is better.

In this scenario, Plan A's cash flow is 7,750, Plan B's is 6,850.

So Plan A's ROI is higher than Plan B's.

Thus, in Option A, Plan A is better.

Option B: Plan A's rate drops to 3%.

So Plan A's interest rate drops to 3%, Plan B's rate remains at 4.5%.

So Plan A's cash flow:7,750.

Plan B's cash flow:6,850.

Same as Option A.

So Plan A is better.

Option C: Plan B's rate remains at 4.5%.

No change.

So no impact on Plan B's ROI.

Option D: Plan A's rate remains at 4.5%.

No impact on Plan A's ROI.

Option E: Plan B's rate increases to 5.25%.

No impact on Plan B's cash flow.

Option F: Plan A's rate increases to 3%.

So Plan A's interest rate drops to 3%, while Plan B's remains at 4.5%.

Plan A's cash flow:7,750.

Plan B's cash flow:6,850.

Same as previous options.

Option G: Plan B's rate increases to 5%.

No impact on Plan B's cash flow.

Option H: Plan A's rate increases to 4.5%.

No impact on Plan A's cash flow.

Option I: Plan B's rate increases to 5.25%.

No impact on Plan B's cash flow.

So, in all scenarios where Plan B's rate is higher than 3%, Plan B's cash flow remains 6,850, which is less than Plan A's 7,750.

Thus, in all such scenarios, Plan A's ROI would be higher.

Wait, but this can't be right, because in some scenarios, perhaps Plan B's ROI would be higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ROI as the cash flow divided by initial investment.

But that's not correct, as it doesn't account for the time value of money.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering the cash flows and ignoring the time value of money, so the higher cash flow plan is better.

In this case, Plan A's cash flow is higher than Plan B's, so Plan A's ROI is higher.

Thus, the best option is to have Plan A's cash flow higher, which is achieved when Plan B's rate is reduced to 3% (Option A).

In this case, Plan A's cash flow is 7,750, Plan B's is 6,850, so Plan A is better.

But let's see if that's the case.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is intended to have Plan B's ROI higher in some scenarios.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about whether the interest rate affects the cash flow in a way that makes Plan B's cash flow higher.

But Plan B's cash flow is 6,850, while Plan A's is 7,750.

So Plan A's cash flow is always higher, so Plan A's ROI is always higher.

Thus, the best option is to have Plan A's cash flow higher, which is when Plan B's rate is reduced to 3%.

Thus, in Option A, Plan A's ROI is higher.

But let's confirm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about whether the interest rate affects the ROI differently.

Wait, but in all scenarios, Plan A's ROI is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about whether the interest rate affects the cash flow differently.

Wait, if the interest rate is lower, the tax saving is higher, so the after-tax cash flow is higher.

So Plan A's cash flow is 7,750, while Plan B's is 6,850.

Thus, Plan A's cash flow is always higher, making Plan A's ROI higher regardless of the interest rate.

So the best option is to have Plan A's cash flow higher, which is when Plan B's rate is reduced to 3%.

Thus, the correct answer is Option A.

But wait, the options are:

A: Plan B's rate drops to 3%.

B: Plan A's rate drops to 3%.

C: Plan B's rate remains at 4.5%.

So, the options are:

A) Plan B's rate drops to 3%.

B) Plan A's rate drops to 3%.

C) Plan B's rate remains at 4.5%.

So, in Option A, Plan B's rate drops to 3%, which is the scenario where Plan A's ROI is higher.

Thus, the correct answer is Option A.

But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the time value of money.

If the interest rate is lower, the tax saving is higher, so the after-tax cash flow is higher.

But without discounting, the cash flow is higher, so the ROI is higher.

But if we discount the cash flows, the higher after-tax cash flow may not necessarily lead to a higher ROI.

Wait, but the problem says to compare the investment plans, so perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the cash flow as the higher amount, thus making Plan A better.

Thus, the correct answer is Option A.
</think>

The best investment plan is when Plan B's rate drops to 3%, as this results in Plan A's cash flow being higher, leading to a higher ROI.
