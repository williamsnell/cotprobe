Okay, so I've got this question about an electric motor and how fast it can lift a mass. Hmm, let's see. I remember that electric motors are related to power and torque, but I need to figure out the steps to solve this.

The motor's label says 120V AC, 1.0 Amps, 60 Hz. Oh wait, 120V is the RMS value, right? So the current is 1.0 Amps. Oh, and frequency is 60 Hz, which is standard for AC power.

The question is about lifting a 6 kg mass at a constant speed. So that's the application of power, I think. Power is the rate at which work is done, and in this case, the motor is doing work to lift the mass, so the power should equal the power needed to lift it.

Wait, let's think about power in two forms. The motor's output power is probably the product of voltage and current. So power = V × I. Oh yeah, that's correct. So V is 120 V, I is 1.0 A. So 120 * 1.0 is 120 W. So the motor's output power is 120 watts.

But the work done by the motor is to lift the mass. The work done is force times distance, and since it's lifting at constant speed, the force needed is the weight of the mass. So power is also force times velocity. So P = F * v.

Wait, so P (power) equals force times velocity. The force here is the force needed to lift the mass, which is the weight. Weight is m * g, where m is mass, g is 9.8 m/s². So F = m * g. The mass is 6 kg, so F = 6 * 9.8 = 58.8 N. Wait, but wait, the question says "lift a 6 kg mass," so it's that force.

So then, setting the power (120 W) equal to force (58.8 N) times velocity (v), we can solve for v: v = P / F. So v = 120 / 58.8.

Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 58.8. Hmm, let's see. 58.8 times 2 is 117.6. That's less than 120. 58.8 * 2.04 is approximately 58.8 * 2 = 117.6, and 58.8 *0.04 is about 2.352. So 117.6 +2.352=119.952, which is almost 120. So v is about 2.04 m/s. But wait, the options don't have 2.04 exactly. Let me look back at the options.

The options are A:0.75, B:1.5, C:0.3, D:2.0, E:1.25, F:3.0, G:2.2, H:2.5, I:1.0, J:0.5. So the closest is D:2.0. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait a second. The motor's power is 120 W, correct. The force is 6 kg * g, which is 58.8 N. So 120 /58.8 = approximately 2.04 m/s. So the answer would be 2.0 m/s, which is option D. But wait, the problem is about lifting at constant speed. So maybe we should consider the torque and speed related, but no, because the question is about constant speed, which relates to the power required.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Oh, in the case of a motor, the power would be torque multiplied by angular velocity. But here, the question is about lifting a mass, so maybe it's about the mechanical power being used. So perhaps my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but another thing: is the motor's torque related to speed? Or is the speed given? The question says "at what constant speed can the motor lift up a mass." So perhaps the speed is related to how quickly the motor can spin, but no, in this case, the question is about the speed at which the motor lifts the mass, which is the same as the speed of the motor's rotation in the lifting scenario. Or is that the case?

Wait, no. Because when a motor lifts a mass, the speed is related to how quickly it's spinning. Wait, but in this case, the question is about the speed at which the motor can lift the mass, not the speed of the motor's rotation. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but another point: the motor's power is 120 W. The power to lift the mass is F * v. So F is 6 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 58.8 N. So 120 = 58.8 * v. Solving for v, v is 120/58.8 = approximately 2.04 m/s. So the closest option is D: 2.0 m/s. But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 2.0 m/s. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing: perhaps I should have considered the torque. Oh, wait, torque is related to power, but I think that for this problem, the approach I took is correct. Because the motor's power is the same as the power needed to lift the mass, and the lifting power is F*v. So yes, the speed would be around 2.04 m/s, which is approximately 2.0 m/s.

To determine the constant speed at which the motor can lift a 6 kg mass, we analyze the power provided by the motor and the force required to lift the mass. The motor's power is calculated as:

\[
P = V \times I = 120 \, \text{V} \times 1.0 \, \text{A} = 120 \, \text{W}.
\]

The force required to lift the mass is its weight:

\[
F = m \times g = 6 \, \text{kg} \times 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 58.8 \, \text{N}.
\]

Power is also expressed as:

\[
P = F \times v,
\]

where \(v\) is the speed at which the mass is lifted. Rearranging for \(v\):

\[
v = \frac{P}{F} = \frac{120}{58.8} \approx 2.04 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The closest option to this calculated speed is \(2.0 \, \text{m/s}\), which corresponds to option D. Therefore, the motor can lift the mass at a constant speed of approximately \(2.0 \, \text{m/s}\).
