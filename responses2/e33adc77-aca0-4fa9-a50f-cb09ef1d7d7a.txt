Okay, so I've got this question about holograms and how the image changes when using different wavelengths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this.

Alright, the question says that a hologram is made using orange light, 600 nm, and then viewed with green light, 500 nm. I need to figure out how the images differ from those formed with orange light. The options are various ratios of image distance to object distance.

Wait, I remember that in holography, the image is formed using the principle of interference. The formula for the image distance in a hologram involves the ratio of the wavelengths used during the recording and viewing. Oh right, the image distance depends on the ratio of the wavelength when the light was recorded (lambda1) to the wavelength when it's viewed (lambda2).

So the formula I think is something like (lambda1 / lambda2) = (image distance / object distance). Because the distance from the object to the image relates to the ratio of the wavelengths.

Wait, let me get the formula right. I think the image distance equation for a plane wavefront is involved here. Oh wait, in the thin film interference, the condition for constructive interference is 2t cos(theta) = (m lambda2) for the reflected light. But that's for thin film. Wait no, hologram is formed in a way that the image is formed by the interference of the light reflected from the object and the mirror. So the image distance is determined by the ratio of the two wavelengths.

Wait, the image distance (u) is related to the object distance (v) by the ratio of the two wavelengths. So u = (lambda1 / lambda2) * v.

Wait, let me think again. The condition for the image in a hologram is that the path difference must be a multiple of the wavelength of the light being used. So the path difference is 2t (assuming t is the thickness, but here t is part of the formula for the image distance).

Alternatively, the image distance u is determined by the ratio of the two wavelengths. So the formula is u = (lambda1 / lambda2) * v.

So, for orange light (lambda1 = 600 nm) and green (lambda2 = 500 nm), the ratio is 600/500 = 6/5.

Wait, let's write that down.

u = (600 nm / 500 nm) * v = (6/5) v.

So the image distance is (6/5) times the object distance. Looking at the options, option F says "the reconstructed image distance = (5/6) the object distance." Wait, that can't be right. Because according to the formula, u is 6/5 v. So F is 5/6 v, which is the reciprocal. So option F is the inverse. Hmm, but wait, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up lambda1 and lambda2. Let me think again. The image distance is determined by the ratio of the two wavelengths. So if the light used for the image is lambda2, then u = (lambda1 / lambda2) * v.

Yes, that's correct. So u = (600/500) v = 6/5 v. So the image distance is (6/5) times the object distance. Looking at the options, option F says (5/6) v. That's the inverse. Hmm, so perhaps I'm getting the ratio wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is u = (lambda2 / lambda1) * v. Let me think: when you have a hologram, the image distance is determined by the ratio of the wavelength used in the recording (lambda1) to the wavelength used in the viewing (lambda2). Because the path difference in the interference is 2t, and the condition is that this must be a multiple of lambda2. So the path difference is 2t = m lambda2. Also, the image distance u is determined by how the light reflects and travels. The equation I remember is u = (lambda1 / lambda2) * v.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about it another way. In a holographic setup, the image distance is given by u = (lambda1 / lambda2) * v. So when lambda1 is 600, lambda2 is 500, u = (600/500)v = 1.2 v = (6/5)v.

So the image distance is 6/5 times the object distance. Looking at the options, let's see which one says that.

Looking at the options:

A: (3/2) v (which is 1.5)
B: (6/5)v → which is 1.2
C: (4/5)v → 0.8
D: 2v → 2.0
E: v → 1.0
F: (5/6)v → ~0.833
G: 3v
H: same as object → 1.0
I: 5/4 v → 1.25
J: 2/3 v → ~0.666

Ah, so option B says image distance is (6/5) times the object distance. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait. I thought the formula was u = (lambda1 / lambda2) * v. So in this case, 600/500 is 6/5. So u = 6/5 v. So option B is (6/5)v, which is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way: The image distance is determined by the ratio of the wavelengths. So the condition for constructive interference in the hologram is that the light reflects off the object and the mirror, and the path difference must be a multiple of the wavelength of the light that's being viewed. So the path difference is 2t = m lambda2. But the image distance u is determined by how the light reflects off the object, which is in the orange wavelength. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the image distance being proportional to lambda1 / lambda2.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as u = (lambda1 / lambda2) * v. So the image is further away when the object is viewed with a shorter wavelength. Because lambda1 is 600, lambda2 is 500. So 600/500 is 6/5, so u is (6/5) v. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes in these problems, the image distance is given by u = (lambda1 / lambda2) * v. So in this case, since lambda1 is bigger than lambda2, u is larger than v. So the image is further away. So the image distance is (6/5) of the object distance. So option B is (6/5) v. So B is correct.

So the answer is B. But let me think again about the problem. The question says: the images are formed with light of wavelength 600 nm and then viewed with 500 nm. So the setup is that lambda1 is 600 (recorded), lambda2 is 500 (viewed). So the image distance is u = (600/500) * v = (6/5)v. So image distance is 6/5 times object distance. So the image is further away than the object by a factor of 6/5. So the image distance is (6/5) times v, which is option B.
</think>

To determine how the images differ when viewed with light of wavelength 500 nm (green) compared to when viewed with light of wavelength 600 nm (orange), we use the relationship between the image distance \( u \), the object distance \( v \), and the wavelengths of light. The formula is:

\[
u = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2} \cdot v
\]

Here, \( \lambda_1 = 600 \, \text{nm} \) (orange) and \( \lambda_2 = 500 \, \text{nm} \) (green). Substituting these values:

\[
u = \frac{600}{500} \cdot v = \frac{6}{5} \cdot v = 1.2 \cdot v
\]

This means the image distance is \( \frac{6}{5} \) times the object distance. Among the given options, this corresponds to option **B**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: \( \frac{3}{2} \, v \) (1.5 times) — Incorrect, as the ratio is \( \frac{6}{5} \), not \( \frac{3}{2} \).
- **B**: \( \frac{6}{5} \, v \) (1.2 times) — Correct, matches the calculated ratio.
- **C**: \( \frac{4}{5} \, v \) (0.8 times) — Incorrect, as the ratio is \( \frac{6}{5} \), not \( \frac{4}{5} \).
- **D**: \( 2 \, v \) (2.0 times) — Incorrect, as the ratio is \( \frac{6}{5} \), not \( 2 \).
- **E**: \( v \) — Incorrect, as the image distance is longer than the object distance.
- **F**: \( \frac{5}{6} \, v \) (0.833 times) — Incorrect, as the ratio is \( \frac{6}{5} \), not \( \frac{5}{6} \).
- **G**: \( 3 \, v \) — Incorrect, as the ratio is \( \frac{6}{5} \), not \( 3 \).
- **H**: Same as object distance — Incorrect, as the image distance is longer than the object distance.
- **I**: \( \frac{5}{4} \, v \) (1.25 times) — Incorrect, as the ratio is \( \frac{6}{5} \), not \( \frac{5}{4} \).
- **J**: \( \frac{2}{3} \, v \) (0.666 times) — Incorrect, as the ratio is \( \frac{6}{5} \), not \( \frac{2}{3} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
