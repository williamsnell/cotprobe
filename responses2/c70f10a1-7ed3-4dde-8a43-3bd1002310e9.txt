Okay, I'm trying to solve this ratio problem. The question is to write the ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers in its simplest form. The options are A through J. Hmm, ratios can be tricky sometimes, but let's take it step by step.

First, what's a ratio? I remember it's a comparison between two numbers. In this case, we're comparing runners to swimmers. So, the ratio is 96:216. Now, I need to simplify this ratio to its lowest terms. 

Simplifying a ratio means dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). So, I need to find the GCD of 96 and 216. Let me think about how to find the GCD. One way is to list all the factors of each number and find the largest one they have in common.

Alternatively, I can use prime factorization. Let's try that. 

Breaking down 96:
96 can be divided by 2: 96 ÷ 2 = 48
48 ÷ 2 = 24
24 ÷ 2 = 12
12 ÷ 2 = 6
6 ÷ 2 = 3
3 is a prime number.

So the prime factors of 96 are 2^5 * 3^1.

Breaking down 216:
216 ÷ 2 = 108
108 ÷ 2 = 54
54 ÷ 2 = 27
27 ÷ 3 = 9
9 ÷ 3 = 3
3 ÷ 3 = 1

So the prime factors are 2^3 * 3^3.

Now, the GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors. For 2, the smallest exponent is 3 (since 2^3 is in 216 and 2^5 in 96). For 3, the smallest exponent is 1. So GCD is 2^3 * 3^1 = 8 * 3 = 24.

Alternatively, I could have found the GCD by listing factors. But prime factorization seems more efficient.

So, dividing both 96 and 216 by 24:

96 ÷ 24 = 4
216 ÷ 24 = 9

So the simplified ratio is 4:9.

Looking at the options, I'm looking for a fraction that equals 4/9. Let me check each option.

Option B: 9 over 4 → 9/4, which is the inverse of 4/9. Doesn't match.

Option H: 4 over 9 → 4/9. That's the same as what we found.

Other options: Let's make sure none of them simplify to 4/9.

Option G: 96/216 → that's the original ratio. Not simplified.

Option D: 48 over 108 → Dividing numerator and denominator by 24: 48 ÷ 24=2, 108 ÷24=4.5 → but wait, 2 and 4.5 are not integers. Hmm, wait, maybe I should divide by 24 again. Wait no, 48 and 108 divided by 24 is 2/4.5, which is 2/4.5. That's not the same as 4/9. Alternatively, let's check the GCD of 48 and 108. The GCD is 12. 48 ÷12=4, 108 ÷12=9. So yes, that's 4/9. So option D simplifies to 4/9, which is the same as our ratio. So that's also a correct ratio. Wait, but in option D, the numbers are 48:108. Hmm, wait, but 96:216 simplifies to 4:9, which is option H. So both B and D simplify to 4:9, but that can't be right because ratios are unique up to scaling. Wait, no, because if you multiply both by 2, you get 96:216 → 192:432, which isn't an option. But the options are given as specific fractions. So, perhaps the question is about the ratio in simplest terms as a fraction, not necessarily in terms of the same base.

Wait, but the question says "the ratio of 96 to 216 in simplest form". So, the way I thought is correct. The simplest form is 4/9. So looking for a fraction that equals 4/9.

Option H is 4/9. So that's correct. But let me check the other options.

Option D: 48/108. Let me calculate what that is. 48 ÷ 12 =4, 108 ÷12=9. So yes, that's 4/9. So both H and D are 4/9, but that's impossible because ratios are unique. So why are they both options? Wait no, maybe I made a mistake. Because 4/9 is the same as 48/108, but 48/108 is in option D. So option D is 48/108, which is 4/9. So that's correct. So why is option H also correct? Because 4/9 is the same as 48/108. So perhaps the question is looking for the ratio in its reduced form, which is 4/9. So both H and D are correct in that sense. Wait no, because 4/9 is a simpler form than 48/108. Wait, no, 48/108 can be simplified more. Oh wait, no, 48 and 108 have a GCD of 12. So 48 ÷12=4, 108 ÷12=9. So 48/108 simplifies to 4/9. So both 4/9 and 48/108 represent the same ratio. But the question is asking for the ratio in its simplest form. So the simplest form is 4/9, which is the same as 48/108. So which option is the correct one.

Wait, but the options are written as fractions. So option H is 4/9, which is the simplified ratio. Option D is 48/108, which is another equivalent ratio but not in simplest terms. So the question is asking for the ratio in simplest form, so it should be 4/9. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but the options include many other fractions. So I need to make sure that H is indeed in simplest form. Let me check the other options.

Option G is 96/216, which is the original ratio. Not simplified.

Option B is 9/4 → which is the inverse of 4/9. So that's incorrect.

Option F:6/15 → Simplify 6/15: GCD is 3, so 2/5. Not 4/9.

Option J:12/27 → GCD is 3, so 4/9. So both H (4/9) and J (12/27) are correct in that they are equivalent ratios. But the question is about the ratio in simplest form. So 4/9 is simpler than 12/27, so the correct answer is H.

Option I:18/72. Simplify that: GCD is 18. 18 ÷18=1, 72 ÷18=4. So 1/4. Not 4/9.

Option E:24/54. GCD is 6. 24 ÷6=4, 54 ÷6=9. So 4/9. So option E is also a correct ratio in simplest form.

Wait, that's confusing. Because both H and E are correct in that they simplify to 4/9. But the question is looking for the ratio in its simplest form, which is 4/9. So both H and E are correct, but in the options, perhaps I need to pick one.

Wait, but the options are all separate. So what's the correct way to represent the ratio in simplest form? The question asks for the ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers in simplest form. So their ratio is 96:216, which simplifies to 4:9.

Looking at the options for fractions, 4/9 is option H. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but I'm seeing that option E is 24/54, which also reduces to 4/9. So that's another correct option. But perhaps the question is looking for the ratio in the simplest form, which is 4/9, so the correct option is H.

Wait, another way to approach this: The ratio 96:216 can be simplified by dividing both by 96. Let me see.

Wait, 96 divided by 96 is 1. 216 divided by 96 is 2.25. Hmm, that's not helpful because it's a decimal. Alternatively, let's divide both by their GCD, which is 24 as I found earlier. So 96 ÷24=4, 216 ÷24=9 → so 4:9.

So the ratio is 4:9, which is option H.

Thus, the correct answer is option H.

The ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers is 96:216, which simplifies by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 96 and 216 is 24. Dividing both by 24 gives 4:9. Among the options, only option H (4/9) represents this ratio in its simplest form.

Answer: H
