Okay, so I have this problem here about an input signal and a filter. Let me try to think through it step by step. The input is v(t) = I δ(t), which is an impulse function scaled by I. The filter has a transfer function H(s) given by (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). Wait, but wait a second, I think I might have confused the variables here. Oh wait, the transfer function is given as (1 - e^{-jτω})/(jω). Hmm, so maybe it's in terms of jω? Or perhaps the system is in the Laplace domain, not the Fourier domain. Because the impulse response is given in the time domain.

Wait, the problem says the filter has a function (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). So, that's probably the Laplace transform of the impulse response, or maybe it's a transfer function. Wait, but the impulse function is δ(t), which has the Laplace transform 1. So, if the transfer function is (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω), then that would be the Laplace transform of the impulse response h(t). So, the impulse response h(t) would be the inverse Laplace transform of this.

Hmm, let's think about how to find h(t) from H(s). The transfer function is (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). Let me try to break this down. Let's consider that jω is the Laplace transform variable s=jω. So, the transfer function H(s) is (1 - e^{-τ s}) / s. Because jω = s when we're dealing with Laplace transforms of real signals. Wait, no, because jω is the imaginary axis in the s-plane, so for real signals, like an impulse response, the Laplace transform would be H(s) = ∫_{0}^{∞} h(t) e^{-st} dt. So, for the given H(s) = (1 - e^{-τ s}) / s, that would correspond to the impulse response h(t) being the inverse Laplace transform of (1 - e^{-τ s})/s.

So, the inverse Laplace of 1/s is u(t) (the unit step function). The inverse Laplace of e^{-τ s}/s is u(t - τ). So, (1 - e^{-τ s})/s would have an inverse Laplace of u(t) - u(t - τ). So, h(t) = u(t) - u(t - τ). But wait, let me think about that again. Because the impulse response is the inverse transform of H(s). So, H(s) = (1 - e^{-τ s})/s, so the inverse transform would be the difference between the unit step and the unit step delayed by τ. So, h(t) = u(t) - u(t-τ). 

Wait, but wait, the units here. Because in the problem statement, the input is δ(t), the impulse, which is a Dirac delta function, and the transfer function is H(s) = (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). Wait, but why is it using jω here? Oh, because in the Laplace domain, the transfer function is often expressed in terms of s=jω for frequency domain analysis. But in this problem, the transfer function is given as a function of ω, which perhaps is the Laplace variable s. Hmm, perhaps I misread the transfer function. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The transfer function is given as (1 - e^{-jωτ})/(jω). Wait, so jω is the variable here. So, perhaps this is the transfer function in the frequency domain, which is H(jω) = [1 - e^{-jωτ}]/(jω). So, that's the Fourier transform. Then, the impulse response h(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of H(jω).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the s-domain. Let me think about both possibilities.

Wait, but I think the problem is about the time domain because the input is a delta function, and the filter's transfer function is given in terms of ω. So, perhaps it's the Laplace transform. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, H(s) = (1 - e^{-τ s})/s. The inverse Laplace transform of this is h(t) = u(t) - u(t-τ). Because the Laplace transform of u(t) is 1/s, and the Laplace transform of u(t-τ) is e^{-τ s}/s. So, (1 - e^{-τ s})/s would be the Laplace transform of u(t) - u(t-τ). Therefore, h(t) = u(t) - u(t-τ).

Now, the output of the filter is the convolution of the input signal and the impulse response. The input is v(t) = I δ(t). The impulse response is h(t) = u(t) - u(t-τ). So, the convolution integral is v_o(t) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} v(τ) h(t - τ) dτ. Since v(t) is I δ(t), v(τ) is I when τ=0 and zero elsewhere. So the convolution becomes I * [h(t)].

So, v_o(t) = I * [u(t) - u(t-τ)].

Let me compute that integral. So, h(t) = u(t) - u(t-τ). So, substituting into the convolution, v_o(t) = I ∫_{-∞}^∞ δ(τ) [u(t - τ) - u(t - τ - τ)] dτ.

Since δ(τ) is zero except at τ=0, the integral becomes I [u(t - 0) - u(t - 0 - τ)] = I [u(t) - u(t - τ)].

Wait, no wait. Let me get this right. The convolution is ∫_{-∞}^\infty v(τ) h(t - τ) dτ. Since v(τ) is zero except at τ=0, this simplifies to v_o(t) = I * h(t) = I * [u(t) - u(t - τ)].

So, v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t - τ)].

Looking at the options, option G is v_o(t) = I [u(t) * u(t-τ)]? Wait, no, option G says u(t) * u(t-τ). That's the multiplication of two step functions. Wait, no. Let me check the options.

Options: 

G: v_o(t) = I [u(t) * u(t-τ)].

Wait, wait, no. Let me look again. The options are:

A: δ multiplied by exponential.

B: exponential minus unit step.

C: 1 minus e^(-jωτ).

D: u(t) over (u(t) + u(t-τ)).

E: u(t) over u(t-τ).

F: u(t) plus u(t-τ).

G: u(t) multiplied by u(t-τ).

H: u(t) minus u(t-τ).

I: δ minus e^(-t/τ).

J: sin(ωt) multiplied by u(t-τ).

Wait, no, option H is u(t) - u(t-τ). So that's exactly what I got.

Wait, wait. So the output is I [u(t) - u(t-τ)] which is option H.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the transfer function given might be in the s-domain. So perhaps I should compute the output in the time domain using the impulse response, but in the s-domain.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the Fourier transform of the impulse response, then convolve with the Fourier transform of the input. But wait, the input is δ(t), which has Fourier transform 1. So, this approach would give the same result as the time domain approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the transfer function is in the s-domain, so H(s) is (1 - e^{-τs})/s, and to find v_o(t), we need to compute the inverse Laplace transform of H(s) multiplied by the Fourier transform of v(t), which is 1. So, v_o(t) is the inverse Laplace transform of [ (1 - e^{-τs})/s ] which is u(t) - u(t-τ). So same result.

So, the output is I [u(t) - u(t-τ)].

Looking back at the options, option H is "v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t-τ)]", which matches.

So the correct answer is option H.

The problem involves determining the output of a filter when an impulse signal \( v(t) = I \delta(t) \) is passed through it. The filter's transfer function is given as \( H(s) = \frac{1 - e^{-j\omega\tau}}{j\omega} \), which appears to be in the Laplace domain. The goal is to compute the output signal \( v_o(t) \) by analyzing the impulse response and convolving it with the input signal.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Impulse Response**:  
   The transfer function \( H(s) = \frac{1 - e^{-j\omega\tau}}{j\omega} \) corresponds to the Laplace transform of the impulse response \( h(t) \). To find \( h(t) \), we take the inverse Laplace transform of \( H(s) \).  
   - The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s} \) is \( u(t) \), the unit step function.  
   - The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{e^{-\tau s}}{s} \) is \( u(t - \tau) \), the unit step function delayed by \( \tau \).  
   - Therefore, \( h(t) = u(t) - u(t - \tau) \).  

2. **Convolution with Input Signal**:  
   The input signal \( v(t) = I \delta(t) \) has a Fourier transform of 1. The output signal \( v_o(t) \) is the convolution of the input signal and the impulse response:  
   \[
   v_o(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v(\tau) h(t - \tau) d\tau.
   \]  
   Substituting \( v(\tau) = I \delta(\tau) \), the convolution simplifies to:  
   \[
   v_o(t) = I \cdot h(t) = I \cdot (u(t) - u(t - \tau)).
   \]

3. **Output Signal**:  
   The output signal is \( v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t - \tau)] \). This corresponds to option **H**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It uses \( e^{-t/\tau} \), which is not relevant here.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It involves complex exponentials, which are not present in the impulse response.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It uses \( e^{-j\omega\tau} \), which is the Fourier transform, not the Laplace transform.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. It involves \( u(t) / (u(t) + u(t - \tau)) \), which does not match the derived expression.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It uses \( u(t) / u(t - \tau) \), which is not consistent with the impulse response.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It involves \( u(t) + u(t - \tau) \), which is the sum of unit steps, not the difference.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. It uses \( u(t) \cdot u(t - \tau) \), which is the multiplication of unit steps, not the difference.  
- **Option H**: Correct. Matches the derived output signal \( I [u(t) - u(t - \tau)] \).  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. It uses \( e^{-t/\tau} \), which is the Fourier transform, not the Laplace transform.  

### Final Answer:
ANSWER: H
