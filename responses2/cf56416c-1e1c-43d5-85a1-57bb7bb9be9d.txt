Okay, so I have this question about expressing tax rates in mills per dollar of assessed valuation. Hmm, I remember that a mill is 1/1000 of a dollar. So, when they say mills per dollar, it's like how many mills are equivalent to one dollar. 

Let me think about the math here. If I have a tax rate of X%, I need to convert that to mills per dollar. Since 1 mill is 0.001 dollars, I can set up the conversion. 

So, X% is equal to (X/100) dollars. To find the equivalent in mills per dollar, I need to multiply by 1000 because each mill is 0.001. So, X% equals (X/100)*1000 mills per dollar. Simplifying that, it's X*10 mills per dollar. Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Let's take an example. If the tax rate is 1%, that's 1 per 100 dollars. So, in mills, that's 1000 * (1/100) = 10 per dollar. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The tax rate is a percentage, say R%. So R% is equal to R/100 dollars per dollar. To express this in mills per dollar, since 1 mill is 0.001 dollars, I can find how many 0.001s are in R/100.

So, the number of mills per dollar is (R/100) / 0.001. Because each mill is 0.001 dollars. Let's compute that: (R/100) divided by 0.001 is R/100 * 1000 = 10*R. Oh wait no, (R/100) / 0.001 = R/100 * 1000 = 10*R. So R% equals 10*R mills per dollar. Wait, that can't be right because 1% should be 10 per dollar. Let me check with another example.

If R is 2%, then 2% is 0.02 dollars. To express this in mills: 0.02 dollars is 200 * 0.001 dollars, which is 200 mills. According to the formula, 10*R = 20, which doesn't match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as R% = (R * 1000) / 100. Because 1% is 10 dollars, which is 10000000... wait, no. Let me think. 1% is 1 per 100 dollars. So, the equivalent in mills is 1000 * (1/100) = 10 per dollar. So 1% equals 10 per dollar. So the formula is R * 10.

Wait, but that's not matching the numbers. Let's try R=3.06%. So according to the formula, it's 3.06 *10 = 30.6 per dollar. But looking at the options, option B says 3.06% = 36.6 per dollar. So that's conflicting. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me take R% and convert it to mills per dollar.

R% is R dollars per 100 dollars. So the ratio is R/100 dollars per dollar. To get this in terms of mills, I need to multiply by 1000 (since 1 mill = 0.001 dollars). So (R/100) * 1000 = 10R. So 1% is 10R=10. 2% is 20. So 3.06% would be 30.6, and 6.85% would be 68.5. Looking at the options, option B says 3.06% = 36.6, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Suppose that R% is the tax rate. So R% = R dollars per 100 dollars. So per dollar, it's R / 100 per dollar. To get the mill value, I need to multiply by 1000. So per dollar is (R/100)*1000 = 10*R. So for 3.06%, it's 30.6, and for 6.85% it's 68.5. So looking at the options, option B says 3.06% = 36.6 and 6.85% = 85.5. That's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me check another example. If R is 10%, then 10% is 0.10 dollars. To convert to mills per dollar, how many mills is that? 0.10 / 0.001 = 1000. So 10% is 1000 per dollar. But according to my formula, 10*10=100. That's way off. So something's wrong.

Ah, I see the mistake now. Oh wait, wait, no. 10% is 0.10 dollars. To express this in dollars per dollar, it's 0.10 dollars. So the number of dollars is 0.10 dollars. To convert that to mills, each mill is 0.001 dollars. So 0.10 dollars is how many 0.001s? 0.10 / 0.001 = 100. So 10% is 100 per dollar. So the formula should be R/100 dollars. Then, per dollar, it's R/100 dollars. So per dollar, the number of mills is (R/100) / 0.001 = R/100 * 1000 = 10*R. So 10% would be 100, which aligns with the calculation. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the earlier example, I thought 10% is 1000 per dollar, but that's not correct. Because 10% is 0.10 dollars. So 0.10 dollars is 1000 * 0.001 = 1000*0.001 = 1 mill. Wait, no, 1000 * 0.001 = 1. So 0.10 is 100 times 0.001, so 1000 * 0.001 = 1. So 10% is 1000 * 0.001, which is 1. So 10% is 1 per dollar.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me use the formula again.

R% is the tax rate. So R% = R dollars per 100 dollars. So per dollar, it's R/100 dollars. To express this per dollar, how many mills? Each mill is 0.001 dollars.

So, R/100 dollars per dollar is equal to (R/100) / 0.001 = R/100 * 1000 = 10*R. So 10% is 100 per dollar. Wait, that seems correct because 10% is 0.10 dollars per dollar. 0.10 / 0.001 = 100. So it's correct.

So applying that, 3.06% would be 3.06 *10 =30.6 per dollar. 6.85% is 6.85*10=68.5 per dollar.

Looking at the options, option B says 3.06% = 36.6 and 6.85% =85.5. So that's not matching. Then option B isn't correct.

Wait, what's option B? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 3.06% = 306, 6.85% =685

B: 3.06% =36.6, 6.85% =85.5

C: 3.06% =6.12, 6.85% =13.7

D: 3.06% =15.3, 6.85% =34.25

E: 3.06% =0.306, 6.85% =0.685

F: 3.06% =30.6, 6.85% =68.5

G: 3.06% =61.2, 6.85% =137

H: 3.06% =3.06, 6.85% =6.85

I:3.06% =20.6, 6.85% =45.5

J:3.06% =60.6, 6.85% =170.

So according to my calculation, 3.06% should be 30.6, and 6.85% should be 68.5.

Looking for those numbers, option F says 3.06% =30.6 and 6.85% =68.5. So that's option F.

Wait, but earlier when I thought that 10% would be 1000 per dollar, that was incorrect. Now, I'm confident that the correct calculation is 10R per dollar.

So the correct answer should be option B, no. Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 10% is 1000 per dollar. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 10% is 0.10 dollars per dollar. So 0.10 / 0.001 = 100. So 10% is 100 per dollar. So 10% = 100 per dollar.

But according to the formula, R% = R *10 per dollar.

Wait, no: R% is 10%. So R=10. So 10 *10 =100. So yes, correct.

So 3.06% would be 30.6 per dollar, and 6.85% would be 68.5 per dollar.

Looking for that, option F says 3.06% =30.6 and 6.85% =68.5. So that's option F.

Wait, but earlier, in the initial example, I thought 10% would be 100 per dollar. So if I use this formula, it's correct.

So why did I think option B is correct earlier? Because option B's values don't match this.

So option F is the correct choice. Let's see what the options are again.

Looking back, option F is 3.06% =30.6 and 6.85% =68.5. So yes, that's option F.
</think>

The tax rate must be converted from a percentage to mills per dollar of assessed valuation by multiplying the percentage by 10. For R%, it is R * 10 per dollar.

- 3.06% * 10 = 30.6 per dollar.
- 6.85% * 10 = 68.5 per dollar.

Looking at the options, option **F** matches these values.
