Question:

Hot sand cools off faster at night than does vegetation. Compared with vegetation, sand’s specific heat capacity is

Options:

A: always equal to the specific heat capacity of vegetation
B: higher
C: lower
D: about the same
E: determined by the temperature difference
F: not a determining factor in cooling rate
G: Can’t say
H: inversely proportional to the vegetation
I: directly proportional to the vegetation
J: dependent on the type of sand

Okay, so I have this question about the cooling rates of sand and vegetation. Hmm, I remember that specific heat capacity has to do with how much heat a substance can absorb before its temperature rises, and how quickly that happens. So, the question is about which has a higher specific heat capacity. 

Let me think. Sand is made up of sand particles, which are usually small, loose aggregate. I think sand is a material with low specific heat capacity because when it cools, it doesn't absorb much heat, so it cools off relatively quickly. Vegetation, on the other hand, is living things. They have more mass because they have cells, tissues, and maybe even water. Since plants and animals can absorb a lot of heat to retain their body temperature, they should have a higher specific heat capacity.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the last character of the answer. The options are letters, and the question is, "compared with vegetation, sand’s specific heat capacity is..." So I need to choose whether sand's specific heat is higher, lower, same, etc.

So the options are:

A: always equal
B: higher
C: lower
D: same
E: determined by temp diff
F: not a factor
G: can't say
H: inversely proportional
I: directly proportional
J: depends on sand type.

Wait, the question is about the last character of the answer, so I don't have to think about the entire options, just pick the letter that correctly describes the relationship between sand and vegetation's specific heat capacities.

So, since sand is cooler than vegetation during night, that suggests that sand cools down faster. Specific heat capacity relates to how quickly a substance can release heat. If cooling is faster, it means that sand can release heat more easily, so its specific heat capacity is lower than that of vegetation. Because higher heat capacity means they can retain heat better, so cooling is slower.

So the specific heat capacity of sand is lower than that of vegetation. So the correct answer should be option C: lower.

The specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat required to change its temperature by a certain amount. Sand, being a material with low specific heat capacity, cools off faster when it loses heat. Vegetation, being a living organism with a higher mass and more heat capacity, cools off more slowly. Therefore, compared to vegetation, sand's specific heat capacity is lower.

Answer: C
