Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here. Let me read it again. The question is asking which expression is equivalent to 5 multiplied by (6x plus 3y). And there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a number outside the parentheses, you need to distribute that number to each term inside the parentheses. So, it's like multiplying both terms by 5. Let me think about that step by step.

First, the original expression is 5(6x + 3y). I need to distribute the 5. That means I'll multiply 5 by 6x and then 5 by 3y.

Let me calculate each part. 5 times 6x. 5 multiplied by 6 is 30, so that part becomes 30x. Then, 5 times 3y. 5 multiplied by 3 is 15, so that's 15y. 

So putting it together, after distributing, I have 30x plus 15y. Now I'll look at the options. Option D is 30x + 15y, so that must be the correct answer. 

Wait, just to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Let me double-check my calculations. 6 times 5 is indeed 30, and 3 times 5 is 15. Yep, that's right. So the equivalent expression is 30x plus 15y, which is option D.

The correct answer is the expression after distributing 5 to each term inside the parentheses. Multiplying 5 by 6x gives 30x, and multiplying 5 by 3y gives 15y. Therefore, the equivalent expression is 30x + 15y.

Answer: D
