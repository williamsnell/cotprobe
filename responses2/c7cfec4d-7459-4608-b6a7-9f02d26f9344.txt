Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about reacting rubidium and bromine. Let me read it again. The question says that 1.0 gram of rubidium and 1.0 gram of bromine are reacted. The options are about what's left in the reaction vessel. I remember that when two elements react, you usually get a combination product. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact reaction and how much of each is produced. 

So, rubidium is Rb, and bromine is Br2. When they react, the product should be RbBr, which is rubidium bromide. But wait, wait. Rubidium is a metal, a group 1 metal, and bromine is a diatomic molecule. Oh right, so when a metal reacts with a diatomic gas, the product is a compound where the metal is in a +1 oxidation state. So RbBr would be RbBr, which is a solid, right?

Now, I need to find out which elements are present in the reaction vessel after the reaction. The question says more than 0.10 mg is measurable. So, I need to figure out if all the reactants are consumed or if some are left.

First, I should calculate the moles of each reactant. Moles are calculated as mass divided by molar mass.

Rubidium's molar mass: Let me think. Rb is atomic number 37, so the molar mass is approximately 85.47 g/mol. Bromine: it's Br2, so each Br is about 79.90 g/mol, so 2 * 79.90 = 159.80 g/mol.

Moles of Rb = 1.0 g / 85.47 g/mol ≈ 0.0117 mol.
Moles of Br2 = 1.0 g / 159.80 g/mol ≈ 0.00626 mol.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, Br2 is diatomic, so when you have 1.0g of Br2, you have 1.0 / (2 * 79.90) = 1.0 / 159.8 = approx 0.00626 mol of Br2 molecules.

But each molecule has two Br atoms. So when Rb reacts with Br2, each Rb atom will combine with a Br atom. So, the reaction is Rb + Br2 → RbBr.

Wait, but wait, how many moles of RbBr are produced from the stoichiometry of this reaction?

The reaction is 1 Rb + 1 Br2 → 1 RbBr. So each mole of Rb reacts with one mole of Br2 to produce one mole of RbBr.

So, the limiting reagent will determine how much product is formed and how much is left. Because if you have less of one reactant, that's the limiting factor.

So, moles of Rb: 0.0117 mol.

Moles of Br2: 0.00626 mol.

Comparing the two: Br2 is the limiting reagent because 0.00626 mol is less than 0.0117 mol.

So, all of Br2 will react, and some Rb will remain unreacted.

How much Rb reacts? Each mole of Br2 would require one mole of Rb. So, 0.00626 moles of Rb would react with 0.00626 moles of Br2, producing 0.00626 moles of RbBr.

So, the initial moles of Rb: 0.0117 - 0.00626 = 0.00544 mol. That's the leftover Rb.

How much Br2 remains? It's all consumed, so 0.

How much RbBr is produced? 0.00626 mol.

Now, what is the mass of RbBr? The molar mass of RbBr is Rb (85.47) + Br (79.90) = 165.37 g/mol.

So, 0.00626 mol * 165.37 g/mol ≈ 1.038 grams. Wait, that's a lot. But wait, the question says more than 0.10 mg is measurable. Oh wait, 1.038 grams is way more than 0.10 mg. So, the reaction vessel will definitely have RbBr, and the other elements (Rb and Br2) have been consumed.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because RbBr is a solid with a molar mass of about 165 grams per mole, so 0.00626 mol would be 1.038 grams. But looking at the options, option H says 'Rb only' and option A says 'RbBr only'. The question is about what's left in the reaction vessel—so after the reaction, which elements are present.

Wait, I'm getting a lot of RbBr. So, the reaction vessel would have RbBr, but the other elements (Rb and Br2) would be gone.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that all the reactants are used up except some. So, the products include RbBr, which is a solid, so it's in the vessel. So, the reaction vessel would have RbBr, but the question is about what was left. So, in the vessel, what's left would be RbBr, RbBr.

But wait, the question is, what is left in the reaction vessel in measurable amounts? So, if RbBr is a solid, its mass would be more than 0.10 mg. So, the problem is asking about what remains.

But wait, the question is about "more than 0.10 mg". So, which elements are left?

Wait, let me think again. So, the initial masses are 1.0 g each. Each reactant is 1.0g.

After reaction:

- All Br2 is used up. So, 0 left.

- Rb: 1.0g minus the amount used. Since stoichiometry is 1:1, 0.00626 mol of Rb reacts, which is 0.00626 * 85.47 = approx 0.535 g.

So, 1.0 g - 0.535 g = 0.465 g of Rb left.

- RbBr: 1.038 grams, as I calculated earlier.

So, the vessel now has 0.465g Rb, 0 Br2, and 1.038g RbBr.

But the question is, what remains in the reaction vessel? That is, which elements are present along with measurable amounts?

Wait, but the options don't include 'RbBr, Rb, Br2 are all present'. Let me read the options again.

Option A: RbBr only.

Option H: Rb only.

Wait, wait, wait. So, all the Br2 is gone, Rb is partially consumed, and RbBr is formed.

So, the reaction vessel has RbBr, Rb, and perhaps some unreacted Rb?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.00626 moles of Rb were consumed, so 0.0117 - 0.00626 = 0.00544 mol Rb remains. So, what was left in the vessel? RbBr, Rb, and Br2? But Br2 is all used up. Oh wait, no, the question is about what's left in the vessel—so all the Br2 is gone.

So, the vessel now has RbBr, Rb, and no Br2. Wait, but RbBr is a solid and so it's present.

So, the question is asking which elements are present in the vessel in measurable amounts. So, the reaction vessel has RbBr, which is about 1.038g. Rb is about 0.465g, and Br2 is all used (so 0). So, all three are present, but the question is about what's left in measurable amounts.

But the options don't include 'RbBr, Rb, Br2 are all present'. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: RbBr only.

B: RbBr, Rb, Br2, and Rb2Br.

C: RbBr and Rb2Br only.

D: RbBr, Rb, and Br2.

E: Rb and Br2 only.

F: Br2 only.

G: RbBr and Rb only.

H: Rb only.

I: Nothing.

J: RbBr and Br2 only.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me see the original question again.

Question: What will be left in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg) in the reaction vessel?

So, after the reaction, what's left? RbBr is formed; Rb remains; Br2 is gone.

So, the reaction vessel contains RbBr, Rb, and Br2? No, Br2 is all used. So, after reaction, the vessel has RbBr, Rb, and Br2 is gone, so Br2 is zero.

Wait, but the question is about what's left in the vessel. Since Br2 is all used up, it's gone. So, only RbBr and Rb are present.

Wait, but the question asks, which are left. So, the reaction vessel has RbBr, Rb, and Br2 is gone. So, the options that have RbBr and Rb are options A, D, F, G, H.

Wait, let me look again:

Option A: RbBr only.

Option D: RbBr, Rb, and Br2.

Wait, but Br2 is all used. So, in the vessel, you have RbBr, Rb, and Br2? No, because Br2 is gone. So the vessel can't have Br2. So, the only substances left are RbBr and Rb.

So, which option matches that? Option D says: RbBr, Rb, and Br2. No, because Br2 is gone.

Wait, but the question is about what's left in the reaction vessel. So, the vessel would have RbBr, Rb, and Br2 (but wait, no, Br2 is gone).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the moles.

Moles of Rb: 1.0g / 85.47 g/mol = approx 0.0117 mol.

Moles of Br2: 1.0g / (2 * 79.90) = 1.0 / 159.8 ≈ 0.00626 mol.

So, Br2 is the limiting reagent. So, all of it reacts. Each mole of Br2 reacts with one mole of Rb.

So, Rb used is 0.00626 mol, so 0.00626 * 85.47 ≈ 0.535 g Rb reacted.

So, remaining Rb: 1.0g - 0.535g = 0.465g.

RbBr produced: 0.00626 mol * 165.37 g/mol ≈ 1.038g.

So, the vessel now contains RbBr (1.038g), Rb (0.465g), and Br2 (0).

Wait, but Br2 is all gone, so the only elements left are RbBr and Rb.

So, in the reaction vessel, which of the options matches this? Let's look:

Option D: RbBr, Rb, and Br2.

But Br2 is gone. So, it can't have all three. So, that option is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Wait, the question is about what is left in the reaction vessel, not what's formed. So, the vessel after reaction contains what was not consumed.

So, all of the Br2 is used, so no Br2 left. RbBr is formed, so that's present. Rb is partially consumed, so some Rb is left.

So, in the reaction vessel, you have RbBr and Rb. Br2 is gone.

So, the correct answer would be that RbBr and Rb are present, but which option says that?

Looking at the options again, option D says: RbBr, Rb, and Br2. So, Br2 is not present, so option D is not correct.

Wait, but wait, the question says which is left in measurable amounts. So, the question is, what is present in the vessel.

RbBr is 1.038 grams, which is more than 0.10 mg. Rb is 0.465 grams, also more than 0.10 mg. Br2 is all gone.

So, the reaction vessel contains RbBr and Rb. So, both RbBr and Rb are present in measurable amounts. So, which option includes both of them?

Looking at the options:

Option D: RbBr, Rb, and Br2. But Br2 is gone, so that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read the question again.

The question asks, "what will be left in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg) in the reaction vessel?"

So, the reaction vessel has some of each? Or, no, the reaction vessel has RbBr and Rb. So, both are present, but Br2 is gone.

Looking at the options, perhaps none of the options match. But the options are A to J.

Wait, perhaps the reaction vessel has RbBr, Rb, and Br2 is all gone. So, the reaction vessel contains RbBr and Rb. So, what are the options?

Looking back:

Option D: RbBr, Rb, and Br2.

Option G: RbBr and Rb only. So, that's two elements.

Wait, so G is RbBr and Rb only. So, is that correct?

Because Br2 is gone, so the reaction vessel has RbBr and Rb.

So, the correct answer would be G, which says RbBr and Rb are present.

Wait, but let me confirm.

So, after the reaction, the vessel has substances: RbBr, Rb, and Br2. But Br2 is all gone, so the vessel has RbBr and Rb.

But in the options, option G is 'RbBr and Rb only'—so that would be correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the reaction vessel has RbBr, Rb, and Br2.

Wait, no. Because in the vessel, after the reaction, Br2 is all consumed, so it's gone. So, the vessel has RbBr and Rb.

So, the correct answer is G: RbBr and Rb only.

So, looking back, the options list G as RbBr and Rb only.

Hence, the answer should be G.

To determine what remains in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg) in the reaction vessel, we analyze the reaction between rubidium (Rb) and bromine (Br₂):

1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   The reaction is:  
   \[
   \text{Rb} + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow \text{RbBr}
   \]  
   This is a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction, meaning one mole of Rb reacts with one mole of Br₂ to produce one mole of RbBr.

2. **Molar Masses**:  
   - Rb: \( 85.47 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
   - Br₂: \( 159.80 \, \text{g/mol} \)  
   - RbBr: \( 165.37 \, \text{g/mol} \)

3. **Initial Masses**:  
   - 1.0 g of Rb:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of Rb} = \frac{1.0}{85.47} \approx 0.0117 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
   - 1.0 g of Br₂:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of Br₂} = \frac{1.0}{159.80} \approx 0.00626 \, \text{mol}
     \]

4. **Limiting Reagent**:  
   Since the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, Br₂ is the limiting reagent because there are fewer moles of Br₂ (0.00626 mol) than Rb (0.0117 mol).  
   - **Rb reacts with Br₂ in a 1:1 ratio**:  
     - Moles of Rb that react: \( 0.00626 \, \text{mol} \)  
     - Moles of Rb remaining: \( 0.0117 - 0.00626 = 0.00544 \, \text{mol} \)  
     - Mass of Rb remaining:  
       \[
       0.00544 \times 85.47 \approx 0.465 \, \text{g}
       \]

5. **Products**:  
   - Moles of RbBr produced: \( 0.00626 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Mass of RbBr produced:  
     \[
     0.00626 \times 165.37 \approx 1.038 \, \text{g}
     \]

6. **Remaining Substances in the Vessel**:  
   After the reaction:  
   - All Br₂ is consumed (0.0 g remaining).  
   - Rb is partially consumed, leaving \( 0.465 \, \text{g} \) of Rb in the vessel.  
   - RbBr is fully formed, with \( 1.038 \, \text{g} \) of RbBr in the vessel.  

7. **Measurable Amounts**:  
   - RbBr is formed, having a mass of \( 1.038 \, \text{g} \), which is more than \( 0.10 \, \text{mg} \).  
   - Rb is partially consumed, having a mass of \( 0.465 \, \text{g} \), which is also more than \( 0.10 \, \text{mg} \).  
   - Br₂ is completely consumed.  

8. **Answer Selection**:  
   The reaction vessel contains RbBr and Rb, with Br₂ being entirely consumed. Among the options, the correct choice is:  
   **G: RbBr and Rb only**  

ANSWER: G
