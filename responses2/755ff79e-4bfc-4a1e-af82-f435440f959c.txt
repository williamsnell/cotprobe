Okay, so I need to figure out what Mr. Reynolds's percent loss from bad checks is. Let's start by understanding the problem.

He earned $366,000 last year, but out of that, $732 worth of checks turned out to be worthless. So, the total loss from bad checks is $732. But wait, I think I need to calculate the percentage loss relative to his total income. Because the question is about the percent of loss from bad checks, so it's the value of the bad checks divided by his total income, multiplied by 100.

So, the formula would be (Value of Bad Checks / Total Income) * 100. Plugging in the numbers, that's (732 / 366,000) * 100.

Let me calculate that. First, what's 732 divided by 366,000? Let me do that step by step. 

732 divided by 366,000 equals... well, let me simplify. Both numbers are divisible by 6, perhaps? 732 divided by 6 is 122, and 366,000 divided by 6 is 61,000. So now it's 122 / 61,000. Hmm, that's still a small number. Let's see, 122 divided by 61,000. 61,000 times 0.002 is 122, because 61,000 * 0.001 is 61, so 0.002 is 122. So 122 / 61,000 is 0.002.

Wait, that's 0.002. So when I multiply by 100, that's 0.2%. So the loss is 0.2%, which would correspond to option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. 366,000 minus 732 is the net income after bad checks, but the question is about the loss from bad checks, which is the value of the bad checks. So, it's definitely (732 / 366,000) * 100.

But another way to think about it: 732 is what percentage of 366,000. Let's compute 732 / 366000. Let me do that division.

366,000 divided into 732. Well, 366,000 goes into 732 about 0.002 times because 366,000 * 0.002 is 732. So yes, 0.002, which is 0.2% when multiplied by 100.

So the correct answer should be B, which is 0.2%.

The correct answer is B: 0.2%.
