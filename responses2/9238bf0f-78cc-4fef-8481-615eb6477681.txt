Okay, so I've got this problem here about a coat and discounts, and I need to figure out what a shopper would pay in December. Let me break it down step by step.

The coat originally costs $325.00. First, it wasn't sold in November, so the merchant marked it down by 20%. Then in December, they marked it down an additional 10%. I need to calculate the final price after both discounts.

Hmm, right. So, discounts are based on the current price each month. Let's start with the first discount of 20%. 

The original price is $325. A 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the original price because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So, I can calculate that by multiplying 325 by 0.8.

325 * 0.8 = 260. So, after the November discount, the price is $260.

Now, in December, another 10% discount is applied. This time, the price is 10% off the already discounted price from November. So, I need to calculate 10% of $260 and subtract it from $260.

10% of 260 is 0.10 * 260 = 26.

Subtracting that from 260 gives 260 - 26 = 234.

Wait, so the final price is $234.00. Looking at the options, option G is $234.00. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me go through each step again.

Original price: $325.

First discount: 20% off. 20% of 325 is 0.2 * 325 = 65. So, the new price is 325 - 65 = 260. That part seems right.

Second discount: 10% off the new price of $260. 10% of 260 is 26. So, subtracting that gives 260 - 26 = 234. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be G: $234.00.

The coat's price after two successive discounts of 20% and 10% is calculated as follows:

1. **First Discount (20% off):**
   - Original price: $325.00
   - 20% of 325 = 0.20 * 325 = $65.00
   - New price after first discount: $325 - $65 = $260.00

2. **Second Discount (10% off):**
   - New price before second discount: $260.00
   - 10% of 260 = 0.10 * 260 = $26.00
   - Final price after second discount: $260 - $26 = $234.00

The final price a shopper would pay in December is **$234.00**.

**ANSWER: G**
