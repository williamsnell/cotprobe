Question:

A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm where he scraped it on a tree branch 2 days ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (101°F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?

Options:

A: Disruption of vascular basement membranes
B: Decreased plasma protein concentration
C: Reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure
D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation
E: Reduced lymphatic drainage
F: Release of thromboxane
G: High blood pressure
H: Release of histamine
I: Separation of endothelial junctions
J: Increased hydrostatic pressure

Okay, so I've got this question about a patient presenting with arm pain and swelling after scraping a tree branch. Let me try to process it step by step. 

The patient is a 35-year-old man. He's been hurt twice, but the latest incident is on a tree branch. His temperature is 38.3°C, which is pretty high, so he must be a bit ill. He's complaining about pain and swelling on his right arm. Also, when he presses the area, he feels it's tender. So, the main issue here is edema around an erythematous lesion. Edema is swelling, right? Which usually comes from something absorbing fluids, like red blood cells or other proteins.

Now, his right forearm has edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion. Fluctuant suggests that the lesion is varying in size, maybe because it's not stable. The edema is around that lesion, so it's probably related to the injury. The lesion is at the site of trauma, so the injury is what's causing the swelling.

Looking at the options, each is a possible mechanism for the edema. Let's see what each option suggests.

Option A: Disruption of vascular basement membranes. I think that's related to inflammation. When there's inflammation, the basement membrane breaks down, leading to swelling. That could cause edema because the blood vessels might not function properly, so more fluid is released.

Option B: Decreased plasma protein. Plasma proteins are involved in hemostasis. If proteins are low, blood can't concentrate as much, which might lead to edema because the body doesn't need to concentrate as much. But I'm not sure if this is the primary mechanism here.

Option C: Reduced capillary hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure in the blood vessels. If capillary pressure decreases, the blood can't flow as much, leading to edema. That makes sense because if the blood can't circulate, the tissues get more fluid.

Option D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation. Increased permeability would allow more fluids in, leading to edema. That sounds plausible because inflammation makes the capillaries more open.

Option E: Reduced lymphatic drainage. Lymph flow is important for edema. If there's less lymph flow, the body might retain more fluid, leading to edema. But is that the primary cause here?

Option F: Release of thromboxane. Thromboxane is involved in hemostasis. If it's released, it could reduce the body's ability to concentrate, leading to edema. But I'm not too sure about this.

Option G: High blood pressure. High BP could lead to edema because the immune system might attack the blood vessels, but I'm not sure if that's the main mechanism here. The injury seems more likely.

Option H: Release of histamine. Histamine is involved in inflammation. If histamine is released, it could contribute to inflammation, which then leads to edema. But again, I'm not certain if this is the primary cause.

Option I: Separation of endothelial junctions. That sounds like it's related to the structure of the blood vessels. If the junctions separate, maybe the blood can't flow properly, leading to edema. I think this relates to inflammation.

Option J: Increased hydrostatic pressure. If capillary hydrostatic pressure increases, maybe the blood can't flow, leading to edema. Or perhaps higher pressure could contribute to swelling.

Now, thinking about what's happening. He's been hurt on a tree. That's a major injury, probably leading to tissue damage and inflammation. The edema around the lesion is around the injury site. So, what causes edema around an injury site?

Inflammation often leads to increased capillary permeability. When the body is inflamed, more capillary smooth muscle cells are activated, making the capillaries more permeable. This allows fluids in, leading to edema. So increased capillary permeability (option D) would be a primary mechanism.

Also, inflammation can disrupt the basement membranes (A), leading to more fluid. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (J) might also contribute, but I think the main cause here is the increased permeability from inflammation.

Another point: edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion suggests that the inflammation is causing swelling. So the main driver is the inflammation, which is due to the injury.

So the primary mechanism is D: Increased capillary permeability due to inflammation.
</think>

The patient's injury on a tree branch and flaccid edema around an erythematous lesion suggest a primary mechanism of inflammation. This is due to the varying size of the lesion and the fact that the injury caused swelling. Increased capillary permeability (D) is a key mechanism, as inflammation leads to more open capillaries that allow fluids into the tissues. This aligns with the scenario described, making it the most likely answer.

**Answer: D**
