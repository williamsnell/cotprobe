Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about chemical equilibrium. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that two moles of NH3 are introduced into a 1.0-liter vessel and decomposes according to the reaction 2NH3(g) ⇌ N2(g) + 3H2(g). At equilibrium, there's 1.0 mole of NH3 remaining. I need to find the equilibrium constant, K.

Hmm. So, let me start by writing down what I know. The reaction is reversible, so some NH3 will decompose into N2 and H2. At the start, there are 2 moles of NH3. At equilibrium, 1 mole remains. That means the amount that decomposed is 2 - 1 = 1 mole. Wait, wait, but the stoichiometry might complicate this. Let me think.

The reaction equation is 2NH3 → N2 + 3H2. So, for every 2 moles of NH3 that decompose, 1 mole of N2 and 3 moles of H2 are formed. But in this case, the amount remaining is 1 mole NH3. So, how much decomposed?

Wait, the initial amount is 2 moles. At equilibrium, it's 1 mole. So, 2 - 1 = 1 mole decomposed. That's correct. But wait, the stoichiometric coefficients are 2 NH3 → 1 N2 and 3 H2. So, each mole of NH3 that decomposes produces 0.5 mole of N2 and 1.5 mole of H2? Or perhaps I should think in terms of moles of NH3 that reacted.

Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium). 

Initial: [NH3] = 2 M (since it's 2 moles in 1L), [N2] = 0, [H2] =0.

Change: Let's let x be the moles of NH3 that decompose. So, at equilibrium:

NH3: 2 - x

Wait, but wait. No, because according to the stoichiometry, 2 moles of NH3 produce 1 mole of N2 and 3 H2. So, for every 2 moles of NH3 that decompose, the products increase. But in this case, the change is not in the same ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the changes in terms of the moles of NH3 that have reacted. Let me think: suppose x moles of NH3 decompose. So, according to the reaction, 2 NH3 → N2 + 3 H2. So, for every 2 moles of NH3 that react, 1 mole of N2 and 3 H2 are formed.

But wait, in our case, the amount of NH3 that's left is 1 mole. So the amount that has reacted is 2-1=1 mole. So x=1 mole. 

So, the change would be:

NH3: -1 mole (since it's consumed), but wait no, because the stoichiometry is 2 moles of NH3 going to 1 mole of N2 and 3 H2. So for x moles of NH3 that have decomposed, the moles of N2 and H2 produced are (x/2) and (3x/2), respectively.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. 

At equilibrium, the amount of NH3 is 1 mole. So, initial is 2, and 1 is left. So 1 mole has decomposed. But according to the stoichiometry, 2 moles of NH3 decompose to produce 1 mole N2 and 3 mole H2. So, the moles that have reacted is (1 mole NH3) * (2 moles NH3 / 1 mole NH3 decomposed) ) = 2 moles.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if I have 2 moles of NH3 decomposing, but in this case, only 1 mole remains, so 1 mole has decomposed. So, the change in NH3 is -1 mole.

Wait, but the reaction is 2 NH3 → N2 + 3 H2. So, per 2 moles of NH3 that react, 1 mole of N2 is produced and 3 H2 is produced.

But in our case, the amount of NH3 that's left is 1 mole, meaning 1 mole has decomposed. So, the change is -1 mole of NH3, but according to the stoichiometry, that would require a different change in N2 and H2.

Wait, perhaps instead of looking at the amounts, I should set up the ICE table.

Let me define the change in terms of the amount of NH3 that decomposes. Let x be the number of moles of NH3 that have decomposed. So, at equilibrium:

NH3: 2 - x

N2: 0 + (x/2 )

H2: 0 + (3x/2 )

But we know that at equilibrium, NH3 is 1 mole. So:

2 - x =1 → x=1 mole.

So, x is 1 mole. So, the changes would be:

NH3: -1 mole.

N2: (1/2) ×1 = 0.5 mole.

H2: (3/2) ×1 = 1.5 mole.

Wait, but since the vessel is 1 liter, concentrations are same as moles, since 1L.

So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[NH3] = 1 mol/L

[N2] = 0.5 mol/L

[H2] = 1.5 mol/L.

Now, the equilibrium expression is Kc = [N2]^1 [H2]^3 / [NH3]^2.

So,

Kc = (0.5)^1 * (1.5)^3 / (1)^2.

Let me compute that.

0.5 is 0.5, 1.5 cubed is (1.5)(1.5)(1.5) = 2.25 *1.5 = 3.375.

So,

0.5 * 3.375 = 1.6875.

Divide by 1^2 (which is 1), so Kc=1.6875.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.6875.

To solve the problem, we analyze the equilibrium of the reaction:

**2NH₃(g) ⇌ N₂(g) + 3H₂(g)**

**Initial moles of NH₃**: 2 moles  
**At equilibrium**, 1 mole of NH₃ remains, so **1 mole of NH₃ has decomposed**.  

From the stoichiometry of the reaction, every 2 moles of NH₃ that decompose produce 1 mole of N₂ and 3 moles of H₂. Therefore, the changes in moles are as follows:

- **NH₃**: 2 moles decomposed → equilibrium moles = 2 - 1 = 1 mole  
- **N₂**: 1 mole produced  
- **H₂**: 3 moles produced  

Since the volume of the vessel is 1.0 liter, the concentrations are equal to the moles. Thus, the equilibrium concentrations are:

- [NH₃] = 1 M  
- [N₂] = 0.5 M  
- [H₂] = 1.5 M  

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_c = \frac{[N₂]^1 [H₂]^3}{[NH₃]^2}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K_c = \frac{(0.5)^1 (1.5)^3}{(1)^2}
\]

First, calculate \((1.5)^3\):  
\[
(1.5)^3 = 1.5 \times 1.5 \times 1.5 = 3.375
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:  
\[
0.5 \times 3.375 = 1.6875
\]

Since the denominator is \((1)^2 = 1\), the equilibrium constant is:  
\[
K_c = 1.6875
\]

Comparing this value to the options provided, the correct answer is **F: 1.6875**.
