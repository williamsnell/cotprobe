Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about universal screening data. Let me read through it again. The question says that the last few characters of the response must be the letter chosen. Hmm, wait, no, wait. The question is asking which action must be done when universal screening data shows very few students are successfully meeting school competencies. And the options are A to J.

I'm a bit rusty on universal screening, but I think it's a way for schools to assess whether students are meeting their academic standards. If most students aren't meeting the competencies, the school might need to do something.

Looking at the options: A is about investing in new tech. I don't think that's right. More tech might help, but it's not a must when most kids aren't meeting. B says students not meeting must go to lower grades. That doesn't sound right; placement is about ability, not just grade level. C suggests more time. That could help, but again, not necessarily a must.

D is about hiring more teachers to reduce class size. Wait, more teachers might mean more students per teacher, so class size could be smaller, which might help. But I'm not sure if this is a must. Maybe it's a recommendation, not a must action.

E is contacting parents. That makes sense because if some students aren't meeting, parents might know their child's issues and can help. But does the school have to do this? It depends on how many students are not meeting. If it's very few, maybe.

F says giving strategic or supplemental instruction. That sounds like a specific intervention. If many are not meeting, they might need extra help, so this could be a necessary step. 

G suggests changing the core program delivery. That's also a possibility. Maybe the curriculum or teaching methods aren't working, so changing the approach could help.

H is lowering the standards. That feels drastic. If most are not meeting, lowering would make things worse. So H is probably not the correct option.

I is assigning homework more. That's about setting expectations. If many are not meeting, homework might not be enough. So maybe they need more.

J is increasing homework. Oh, wait, if most are not meeting, homework might be causing more problems than it's solving. So maybe J is not a must.

So putting it together: when most students aren't meeting, the school likely needs to focus on specific interventions. So F suggests giving more targeted instruction. G is about program changes, which could be another approach.

But wait, looking at the options, F is about strategic or supplemental instruction, which is a specific action. G is about program changes. Which of these is a "must"?

The question is asking which must be done. So perhaps both F and G could be options, but I think the correct answer is F because it directly addresses the students who aren't meeting competencies. Alternatively, maybe G is also correct because changing the program could help.

Wait, the options are letters A through J. So looking at the options, F says students must be given strategic or supplemental instruction. That's a specific intervention. G says changes must be made in the core program. Both could apply.

But I think when most students are not meeting, the school needs to focus on specific support, which is F. G is more about restructuring, which might be a more permanent change. But the question is phrased as "must be done." So perhaps both options F and G are correct, but looking at the options, I have to choose one.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F because it's a direct approach. Alternatively, if G is a more comprehensive change, perhaps it's a must. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the options are:

F: Students must be given more strategic or supplemental instruction.

G: Changes must be made in the delivery of the core program.

I think both are possible, but the question is about which must be done. Maybe either F or G is correct. But the options don't have an 'FG' option, so the user has to choose between them.

In the context of universal screening showing many students are not meeting, the school might need to provide additional support. So F is a specific intervention, which is a must. G is more about restructuring the program, which could be a necessary change.

Hmm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps F is the correct answer because it directly addresses the students who aren't meeting, whereas G might be more about changing the entire approach.

Wait, what's the difference between F and G? F is giving them more specific instruction, G is changing how the core is delivered. If the core teaching methods aren't effective, changing the program could make a difference.

Alternatively, in the context of universal screening, perhaps the school is seeing a large number of students not meeting, implying a systemic issue, so making changes in the program (G) might be necessary.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Since the question is about the must-do action, perhaps F is the correct one because it's a direct action for the unmet students.

Alternatively, if the school is seeing few students meeting, they must address the unmet ones. So F is correct because it's about giving them specific help.

Wait, another thought: in some contexts, when universal screening shows that many students are not meeting standards, the school might need to implement specific interventions. So F suggests giving them more help, which is a must. G is about changing the program, which could be a way to address it, but maybe it's a more comprehensive approach.

So, considering all, I think the correct answer is F. Or maybe G. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F or G, but in the options, perhaps F is the correct choice.

The correct answer is F. When universal screening data show that few students are meeting school competencies, the school must address the specific needs of the unmet students. F suggests providing strategic or supplemental instruction, which directly targets the students who are not meeting their competencies. This action is a necessary step to help those students improve. 

Answer: F
