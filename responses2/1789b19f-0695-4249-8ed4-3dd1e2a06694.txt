Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about Dershowitz discussing a hypothetical case where hijacked planes of 9/11 must be shot down to argue about important decisions. The options are A to J, each a different statement.

First, I'll try to understand the context. The 9/11 attacks were a global event, and it's a sensitive topic. The scenario presented is hypothetical, so the discussion is likely about the implications of such an event.

The question asks which statement best explains why Dershowitz would argue that decisions like these are often influenced by personal bias. The options are about why decisions might not be made by a single person, through military involvement, a committee of experts, quick decisions, or focus on high officials.

Looking at each option:

A: Should always be made by a single person to ensure accountability. Hmm, this seems related to the idea that a single decision maker could hold it accountable, but the question is about bias influencing decisions.

B: Often influenced by personal bias. That directly relates to the argument in the question. If the decision was influenced by personal feelings, that would explain why bias matters.

C: Should be made by the military without civilian interference. That's a strong stance, but I don't think it's the main point here. Dershowitz is discussing personal bias, not military involvement.

D: Committee of experts. That's about multiple opinions, but again, the question is about bias, not the number of experts involved.

E: Avoided through diplomatic talks. Unrelated; the question is about why decisions are influenced by bias.

F: No objective answer. Not sure, but the question is about why decisions are not free of bias.

G: None of the above. Maybe if none of the other options are correct.

H: Avoid the moral cost. That's about the consequences, not bias.

I: Made quickly. The question doesn't mention speed, so probably not.

J: Made with highest officials. The question doesn't specify who would make the decision, so not likely.

So, the options B and J are about bias and the decision-making process. But the question is specifically about the influence of personal bias in the decisions.

So, the correct answer should be B: decisions are often influenced by personal bias.

Wait, but what about option D? It says decisions are made by a committee of experts. Well, maybe, but the question is about bias, so B is more directly relevant.

So the answer should be B.

The question asks why decisions related to the 9/11 attacks might be influenced by personal bias. The best answer is B, as it directly addresses the influence of personal bias on decision-making.

Answer: B
