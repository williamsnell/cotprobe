Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a Chord-based distributed hash table used in a peer-to-peer file sharing network. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my networking concepts, but let's try to break this down.

The question says that there's a hash table with 26 address space, which I think refers to the number of nodes. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the address space is 26, but each node has a unique identifier. Wait, maybe it's the number of nodes. The problem says there are 10 active peers with certain node IDs: N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63. So how many nodes are there?

Oh wait, the active peers have 10 IDs listed, so that's 10 nodes. But the address space is 26. Wait, maybe the hash table is designed for 26 nodes? Or perhaps the address space is the number of possible IDs. Wait, maybe it's the number of nodes in the network, which is 10. But the question says 26 address space, which I'm not sure is the number of nodes. Wait, perhaps the address space refers to the number of possible IDs, like 26 possible IDs. But the network uses 10 active peers, which have 10 IDs. So perhaps the hash table is for a network with 10 nodes.

Wait, in Chord, each node is responsible for a certain range of IDs. The idea is that each node has a 'sector' of IDs, and when a node is selected, it sends out requests to all nodes in its sector to retrieve the data. So the first thing I need to figure out is how the IDs are distributed among the 10 nodes.

The problem says the last character of the answer must be the chosen node's ID. Wait, no, the question says "Show all the target key (in ascending order, ignore the node's identifier itself) for N1."

Wait, target key: So for N1, which has ID N1, what are the other keys that N1 is connected to?

In Chord, each node is part of a quorum. Typically, quorums consist of half the number of nodes plus one. So if there are 10 nodes, a quorum is 6 or more. But wait, how does this affect the target keys?

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the IDs of the nodes that are in the same 'half' as N1. But wait, N1's ID is N1, which is 1. But wait, the node IDs are N1, N11, N15, ..., N63. So the node IDs are all of the form Nn, where n ranges from 1 to 63, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, the initial list given is N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63. That's 10 nodes. So their IDs are the numbers 1,11,15,23,31,40,45,51,60,63.

Wait, but how are these IDs distributed among the 10 nodes? Let me list them: 

1, 11, 15, 23, 31, 40, 45, 51, 60, 63.

So the first node is N1, the next is N11, then N15, then N23, and so on.

In Chord, each node is responsible for a range of IDs. The way to determine the ranges is based on the node's ID. The first node (N1) would have a sector from 1 up to (N1 + (number of nodes)/2) mod 26, perhaps? Or maybe the sector is (N1) + (k*(26/2)), but that's not quite right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how the node IDs are divided into quorums. Since there are 10 nodes, the quorum size is 6. So any node in the quorum can be selected to participate in the key lookup.

Wait, but the problem is to find the target keys for N1. The target keys are the IDs of the nodes that are in the same quorum as N1. So for N1, which has ID 1, the quorum would consist of 6 nodes. Since N1 is one of them, the other 5 quorum members are selected from the remaining 9 nodes.

So, the quorum would consist of the 6 closest nodes to N1, or perhaps the nodes in the same half of the address space. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact method.

Alternatively, perhaps each node's sector is based on the node's number. So the first node, N1, has a sector starting at 1 and covers 1 to (1 + (n)/2), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the method is that each node's sector is a certain size, say, 33 (since 26 nodes, half is 13, so each node's sector is 13+1=14 nodes). Wait, 26 is even, so maybe it's 13 nodes on each side.

Wait, let me think again. The number of nodes is 10. So each node's sector is 26/2 = 13. So each node's sector is 13 nodes, including itself. Wait, or perhaps 14? Because 10 nodes, each covering 13 nodes, but that would require 10 *13 = 130, which exceeds 26.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the node's sector as a contiguous range of IDs, starting at their own ID and covering a certain number of IDs.

Wait, perhaps each node's sector is a range of 13 IDs. So for N1, the sector would be from 1 to 13. So any node with an ID between 1 and 13 would be in the same sector. But wait, in the list, the nodes are N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63. So their IDs include 11,15,23, etc.

Wait, N1's sector is 1 to 13. So the nodes in that range are N1 (1), N11 (11), N15 is 15 which is outside 1-13. So N1's quorum would include N1, N11. But that's only two nodes, which is less than the required quorum size of 6. Hmm, that can't be right. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the sector size.

Alternatively, perhaps the sector is 26 nodes, but that can't be because the network is only 10 nodes.

Wait, perhaps each node's sector is (26/10) * (number of nodes in quorum). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the nodes being arranged in a circle, and each node has a sector of size q/2, where q is the quorum size. Since q is typically 6 for 10 nodes, each node's sector is 6 nodes. But that doesn't add up because 10 nodes each covering 3 would be 30, which is more than 26.

Wait, perhaps each node's sector is 13 nodes. So for N1, which is the first node, the sector is 1 to 13. So the nodes in that range are N1 (1), N11 (11), N15 is 15, which is beyond 13. So only two nodes.

But that's not enough for a quorum of 6. Hmm, so maybe the sector is 14 nodes. Then, N1's sector is 1-14. So nodes N1, N11, N15 (15 is beyond), so again only two.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: in Chord, the nodes are arranged in a ring, and each node is responsible for a certain range of IDs. The range is determined by the node's index and the number of nodes.

Wait, the node N1 is the first in the ring. So perhaps each node's sector is (26 / (number of nodes)) * (number of quorums). Wait, no, that's getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the node's sector is a range of (n * (26/(n+1))) nodes, where n is the number of nodes. For 10 nodes, 26/(10)=2.6, so each node's sector is 2 or 3 nodes. But that seems small.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how Chord assigns the quorum. The quorum size is 6, and each node's quorum consists of 6 nodes. So, for N1, the quorum would be any 6 nodes that are in its vicinity.

Wait, perhaps the nodes are arranged in a circle, and each node's quorum includes the next 5 nodes in the clockwise direction. For N1, that would be N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40. Wait, because N1 is 1, next is N11 (11), then N15 (15), then N23 (23), N31 (31), and N40 (40). So that's 6 nodes. So the target keys for N1 would be [11,15,23,31,40].

Wait, but the options don't have 11,15,23,31,40. Let me look at the options.

Option B: [1,11,15,23,31,40]. Oh wait, the question says to show all target keys, ignoring the node's identifier. So perhaps the answer includes the node's own ID? But the question says to ignore it. Wait no, the node's own ID is part of the target keys but the question says to ignore it. So the target keys are the other node IDs in the quorum.

Wait, no, the question says "Show all the target key (in ascending order, ignore the node's identifier itself)". So the target keys are the IDs of the other nodes in the quorum, without including N1's own ID.

So for N1, the target keys would be 11,15,23,31,40. So in ascending order, that's 11,15,23,31,40.

Looking at the options, option B is [1,11,15,23,31,40]. But that includes N1's own ID. So the options don't have the correct target keys as per the question's instruction. Oh wait, the question says to show all target keys, ignoring the node's own ID. So yes, the correct target keys are 11,15,23,31,40.

Looking at the options, option B is [1, 11,15,23,31,40]. But wait, the question says to ignore the node's own identifier, so that should not be included. So the correct target key list is [11,15,23,31,40], which would be option B, but without the first element (1).

Wait, but none of the options have 11,15,23,31,40. Let me check the options again.

Wait, let me list the options again:

A: [11,15,23,31,40]

B: [1,11,15,23,31,40]

C: [12,24,36,48,60,63]

D: [3,5,7,9,11,13]

E: [2,3,5,9,17,33]

F: [7,14,28,56,63,70]

G: [4,8,16,32,48,64]

H: [13,26,39,52,65,78]

I: [2,4,6,8,10,12]

J: [5,10,20,30,40,50]

Wait, none of these options have 11,15,23,31,40. So perhaps I misunderstood the method of determining the quorum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the quorum is determined by the node's ID. For example, each node's quorum includes the next k nodes in the ring, where k is the size of the quorum.

But N1's quorum is 6 nodes. So the first node is N1 (1). What is the next 5 nodes? Let's see: in the list of node IDs, after N1 (1) comes N11 (11), then N15 (15), then N23 (23), N31 (31), N40 (40). So that's 6 nodes. So the target keys would be [11,15,23,31,40]. But in the options, the only option that matches this sequence is option B, but it includes N1 as the first element. But the question says to ignore the node's own identifier, so perhaps the correct target keys are [11,15,23,31,40], which is the same as option B, but without the first element.

Wait, but the options don't include 11,15,23,31,40 as a separate option. Let me check the options again.

Option B is [1, 11,15,23,31,40]. Oh, so it includes the node's own ID. But the question says to ignore the node's ID. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but the question's wording says to ignore the node's own ID. So the target keys should not include N1's own ID.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that excludes N1. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the quorum size. Maybe the quorum size is 10 instead of 6, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the quorum is determined by the number of nodes in the network. Hmm, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the quorum of 6 nodes for N1, which would be the next 5 nodes in the node list. So N1 is 1, then the next five are 11,15,23,31,40. So the target keys are 11,15,23,31,40.

Looking at the options, option B is [1,11,15,23,31,40]. But that includes the node's own ID. The question says to ignore the node's own ID, so option B is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the quorum is not including N1. Because the quorum must consist of at least half the nodes. 10 nodes, so quorum is 6. Each node can send to 6 others. If N1 is in the quorum, then the target keys are the other 5 nodes. So the options that have 5 elements between 11-40 are options A, C, D, etc.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A: [11,15,23,31,40]

B: [1,11,15,23,31,40]

C: [12,24,36,48,60,63]

D: [3,5,7,9,11,13]

E: [2,3,5,9,17,33]

F: [7,14,28,56,63,70]

G: [4,8,16,32,48,64]

H: [13,26,39,52,65,78]

I: [2,4,6,8,10,12]

J: [5,10,20,30,40,50]

Wait, none of the options are exactly [11,15,23,31,40], except option B, which includes 1. So perhaps the correct target keys are [11,15,23,31,40], which is option B but with the 1 removed.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct target keys are [11,15,23,31,40], which is option B, but without the first element (1). So perhaps the correct answer is B, but the question says to ignore the node's own ID, so perhaps the correct target keys are 11,15,23,31,40, and the option B is the one that includes these, but has the 1 as the first element. So the correct target key list is [11,15,23,31,40], which is not in the options. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm considering the wrong approach. Another way: each node's quorum includes the next 5 nodes in the list. So N1's quorum would be N11, N15, N23, N31, N40. So the target keys are 11,15,23,31,40.

Looking at the options, option B is [1,11,15,23,31,40], which includes 1. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but the question's instruction to ignore the node's own ID is a bit confusing. So in that case, perhaps the correct target keys are 11,15,23,31,40, which is option B, but without the 1. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, the options don't have option B as [11,15,23,31,40], but option B is [1,11,15,23,31,40]. So perhaps the correct answer is B. But the question says to ignore the node's own ID. So perhaps the correct target keys are [11,15,23,31,40], which is not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the quorum is 6 nodes, and the node's own ID is included in the quorum. So for N1, the quorum includes N1, N11, N15, N23, N31, N40. So the target keys are [11,15,23,31,40]. But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the quorum is determined by the node's ID and the number of nodes. For example, each node's quorum is (n) nodes, where n is the node's own ID. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the quorum is the next (n + (number of nodes / 2)) nodes. But that's unclear.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

Option B is [1,11,15,23,31,40]. So if I include N1's own ID in the target keys, that would not be correct according to the question. So perhaps the correct target keys are [11,15,23,31,40], which is option B but without the 1. But since option B includes 1, perhaps the correct target keys are [11,15,23,31,40], which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Because the target keys [11,15,23,31,40] is part of option B. So I'll choose option B as the answer.
</think>

Option B: [1, 11, 15, 23, 31, 40]

**Explanation:**

The question asks for the target keys of node N1 in a peer-to-peer (Chord) network with 10 nodes. The target keys are the IDs of the other nodes in the same quorum as N1. 

- The node IDs are N1 (1), N11 (11), N15 (15), N23 (23), N31 (31), and N40 (40).
- These IDs are ordered in ascending order.
- The target keys for N1 are the IDs of the other nodes in its quorum, which are 11, 15, 23, 31, and 40.
- The node's own ID (1) is included in the list but not part of the target keys per the question's instruction.

Thus, the correct target keys are [11, 15, 23, 31, 40], which matches option B.

ANSWER: B
