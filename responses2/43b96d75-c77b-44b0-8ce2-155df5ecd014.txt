Okay, so I've got this vector question here. The vector is given as v = (5, 0, 7). The question is asking for the magnitude of this vector. Hmm, I remember that the magnitude of a vector is like its length. Oh right, there's a formula for that. 

Wait, the formula for the magnitude of a 3D vector (x, y, z) is the square root of (x squared plus y squared plus z squared). So, I'll need to square each component, add them up, and then take the square root.

Let me break it down. The x-component is 5, so 5 squared is 25. The y-component is 0, so 0 squared is 0. The z-component is 7, so 7 squared is 49. Adding those together: 25 + 0 + 49 equals 74. Then, I take the square root of 74.

I'm a bit rusty on square roots, but I know that 8 squared is 64 and 9 squared is 81. So, the square root of 74 should be between 8 and 9. Let me think, 8.6 squared is 73.96, which is almost 74. So, the square root of 74 is approximately 8.6. 

Looking at the options, option H is 8.6. So the correct answer should be H.

The magnitude of the vector v = (5, 0, 7) is calculated using the formula for the magnitude of a 3D vector:

\[
\| \mathbf{v} \| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\| \mathbf{v} \| = \sqrt{5^2 + 0^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{25 + 0 + 49} = \sqrt{74} \approx 8.6
\]

The closest option is H: 8.6.

Answer: H
