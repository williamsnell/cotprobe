Question:

A woman owned a four-unit apartment building and lived in one of the units. When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: "Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred." The woman's preference was motivated by the fact that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building, and of the remaining rented units, one was rented to an African American man and the other to a Pacific Islander woman. Based upon these facts, which of the following statements is true?

Options:

A: The federal Fair Housing Act doesn't apply to private landlords.
B: Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.
C: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal laws.
D: The woman's preference is considered discriminatory only if she refuses to rent to a qualified tenant based on their race or gender.
E: The woman's racial or gender preference is allowed under the federal Fair Housing Act if it promotes diversity.
F: The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.
G: The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.
H: There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.
I: The woman's actions are legal under the federal Fair Housing Act as long as she doesn't act on her preference.
J: The woman's actions are legal as long as the apartment is in her primary residence.

Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about the Fair Housing Act and tenant preferences. Let's try to break it down.

The scenario is that a woman owns a four-unit apartment building and lives in one of them. One tenant vacates, and she puts up an advertisement. The ad says, "Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred." The reason given for her preference is that she likes having a mix of both genders and various ethnic backgrounds. She has an African American man and a Pacific Islander woman already in another unit.

Now, the question is about which statement is true regarding the implications of her advertisement, especially in light of the Fair Housing Act.

First, I remember that the Fair Housing Act has several key provisions regarding discrimination. One of the main points is that landlords cannot make certain restrictions on their tenants, like requiring them to be a certain race or gender. But there are exceptions, like if the building has diversity programs offering different housing options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The federal Fair Housing Act doesn't apply to private landlords. Wait, I think the act covers both private and public landlords. So A is incorrect because the act does apply to private landlords.

Option B: Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference. But the law does allow for diversity programs. So stating a preference is allowed as long as it's based on diversity. So B is incorrect because the act allows for such preferences, not that it prohibits them.

Option C: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal. The act applies to both, so this is also incorrect. She could be violating both.

Option D: The woman's preference is considered discriminatory only if she refuses to rent to a qualified tenant based on race or gender. That's a bit confusing. The act says that discrimination occurs when a landlord is discriminatory against a tenant without a legitimate basis. So if she's stating a preference without qualifying, that's not discrimination. But if she refuses, then maybe she's discriminatory. But the option says that the reason she preferred was based on diversity, which I think is allowed. So D seems incorrect because stating a preference is allowed, not necessarily discriminatory if she doesn't act on it.

Option E: The woman's racial or gender preference is allowed under the federal Fair Housing Act if it promotes diversity. I think that's correct. The act allows for diversity programs, so her preference is permissible.

Option F: The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for her to refuse based on race or gender. No, that's the opposite. It allows for diversity, so she can refuse if it's allowed under the diversity program. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The woman's motive absolves her from liability. I'm not sure about this. The act mainly prohibits discrimination. The woman's preference is about diversity, not discrimination. So her reason for preferring might be a lack of discrimination, but I think the option is suggesting that her reason is a excuse for her actions, which isn't in the act. So G is incorrect.

Option H: There are no violations under any federal law. No, because she's possibly violating under the diversity programs.

Option I: The woman's actions are legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference. But the act allows for her to refuse if it's allowed. So I think she could be acting on her preference, but only if it's permitted under the diversity programs.

Option J: The woman's actions are legal as long as the unit is in her primary residence. That's not related to the discrimination issue. It's about the lease and occupancy, not the rental terms. So J is incorrect.

So looking back, the correct statements are E and I. Wait, let me read each option again.

Wait, looking back at the options:

E: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal. So E suggests that she's violating federal laws, which isn't right because the act applies to both. So E is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me reassess each option:

The question is about whether her actions are a violation, and whether they're allowed under the law.

So, the key point is whether the woman's actions are permitted under the Fair Housing Act.

Her advertisement says she's a White male preferred. The reason is that she likes a mix of genders and ethnic backgrounds.

The reason she preferred is based on "a mix of tenants," implying she's open to diversity. So, she's not stating a strict preference for a particular race or gender, but rather expressing an interest in a mix, which the law allows.

So, her statement is permissible under the law because it's about diversity.

Now, looking again at the options:

Option E says she's a violation of state laws, not federal. That's wrong because her actions are a violation of both state and federal laws.

Option I says her actions are legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference. So, if she doesn't refuse, she could be acting on her preference. But the option says she's legal as long as she doesn't act on it. But the act only prohibits discrimination, not refusing based on diversity.

Wait, no. The act allows for diversity in the same way as it allows for non-discrimination. So, if she says she likes diversity, and the building has a diversity program, then she's not violating. But if she refuses to rent to a Black or Hispanic, that's a violation.

So, the woman's actions are allowed under the law if she doesn't act on her preference. But the question states that she's placing the advertisement, and it's possible that she takes it. But the option E is that she's a violation of state laws, but I'm not sure that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct point is that her advertisement is a violation of the law because she's stating a racial or gender preference without a diversity program. So, if the building doesn't have a program, she's violating. But if it does, she's not.

But the question doesn't specify whether the building has a diversity program. It just says she has one unit with an African American man and another with a Pacific Islander woman. So, perhaps the diversity program is available.

Wait, the question says: "the remaining units" â€” which would be three units. But one is occupied by an African American, another by a Pacific Islander, so that leaves two more units. So, if the building has a diversity program, she can express her preference. But if not, it's a violation.

But the question doesn't state whether the building has a diversity program. So, perhaps the assumption is that the building does have one, so her statements are allowed.

Now, looking at the options, which ones are correct.

Option E: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal. That's incorrect because it's a violation of both.

Option B: She was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference. No, she was permitted under diversity.

Option D: The preference is discriminatory if she refuses. No, because the act allows for such preferences.

Option C: Only a violation of state laws. No, federal laws also apply.

Option E: Says she's a violation of state laws. So this is incorrect.

Option I: The woman's actions are legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference. So, if she doesn't refuse, she's legal. But she could still be violating if she refuses. The option says she's legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference. So if she does act on it, she's violating. But the option says she's legal as long as she doesn't. So this is correct.

So, the correct statements are E and I?

Wait, no. Let me go back.

Looking at the question, the correct answer is E and I?

Wait, no. Let me re-examine each option.

Option E says her actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal. That's incorrect because she's a violation of both.

Option I says her actions are legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference. So she's allowed to make the advertisement without acting on it. But the act says that she can refuse to rent to a qualified tenant based on race or gender if it's allowed under the diversity program. So, if she refuses, she's violating. But the option is saying she's legal as long as she doesn't act on it. So if she doesn't act, she's okay. But the option says she's legal if she doesn't act, which is correct.

Wait, but is that the case? The act allows for her to refuse if it's allowed. So her actions are legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference. So E is incorrect because her actions are a violation of both state and federal laws.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's look at the options again.

The question asks which statement is true.

So, the woman's actions are a violation of the law. She can choose to make the advertisement without acting on it if the diversity program allows it. So, she can't act on it unless it's allowed. But the option I says that she's legal as long as she doesn't act on it. So, if she doesn't act, she's legal. But the act allows for her to refuse if it's permitted.

Wait, the question is about whether her actions are a violation. So, her actions (placing the ad) are a violation of the law. She can refuse it if it's allowed under diversity.

So, the correct statements are E and I. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't think I is correct because she can't act on it, but the option says she's legal as long as she doesn't act on it. So, if she doesn't act, it's legal. So the option I is correct.

Let me consider each option again.

E: False because she's a violation of federal laws.

I: True, because she's legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is E and I. Or maybe not.

Wait, another angle: the woman's statement is based on diversity, which is allowed under the law. So, she's not violating, so the correct statements are E and I?

Wait, no. Let me think about the options again.

If the woman's advertisement is about a mix of tenants, and the building has a diversity program, then she's not violating any law. So her actions are legal if she doesn't act on the preference. But if she does act, she's violating.

But the question is about the facts given. The facts are that she placed an advertisement with a mix of races, she's a White male. So, the problem is whether she's violating any law.

So, the correct answer is that her actions are a violation of the law because she's making an advertisement without a diversity program. So, the statement that's correct is E: her actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal. So E is incorrect because she's a federal violation.

Wait, perhaps I'm going the wrong way. Let me think about the Fair Housing Act terms.

Under the act, landlords are allowed to make certain statements. The key is that discrimination occurs when a landlord is discriminatory against a tenant without a legitimate basis.

The woman's statement is about diversity, which is permissible as long as the building has a diversity program. So, under the act, her actions are permissible.

Thus, her actions are not a violation of any law. So, looking at the options, the correct statements would be E (false) because her actions are legal under the law, and perhaps another option.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me look again.

Looking at option E: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal. But she's a violation of both, so E is incorrect.

Option I: Her actions are legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference. So, if she doesn't act, it's legal. So, this is correct.

So, the correct answer is E is false; I is correct.

Wait, but the question says, which of the following is true. So, the correct statement is I.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether she's allowed to make the advertisement without acting on it. The option I says she's legal as long as she doesn't act on it. So, she can make the ad without acting, which is allowed.

So the correct statement is I.

Wait, but wait: the act doesn't restrict the act of making an advertisement unless it's based on a discrimination. So, she's permitted to make the ad, but if she acts on it (i.e., rents to a tenant based on her statement), that's a violation.

Thus, her actions (making the ad) are a violation of the law. So, the correct statement is E is false.

Wait, I'm getting myself into a loop. Let me try to list out the key points.

The woman's advertisement says: "Two-bedroom, White male preferred." The reason given is that she likes a mix of genders and ethnic backgrounds. She's in a four-unit building, one unit has an African American, another a Pacific Islander.

Under the Fair Housing Act, the relevant provisions are:

1. Landlords are not prohibited from making statements about diversity unless it's based on a legitimate reason (e.g., employment, age, etc.).

2. The act allows for diversity programs in the same way as discrimination is allowed.

So, her statement is about diversity. If the building has a diversity program, her statement is permissible. But the question doesn't specify whether the building has such a program.

In the scenario, the building has units with diverse tenants. So, perhaps the diversity program is already in place.

So, her advertisement is permitted. Therefore, her actions are legal if she doesn't act on them, but she's a violation if she does.

But the question is about the facts. The facts don't state whether a diversity program is in place, so I think the correct interpretation is that her actions are permissible.

Wait, but the problem is that the woman's statement is based on "a mix of tenants," implying she's open to diversity, which is allowed. So, her actions are permissible.

Thus, the correct statements would be E is false (she's a violation of both state and federal laws), I is true (she's legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference), etc.

Wait, but among the options, the correct answer is E is incorrect. So the options are:

E: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal laws.

Which is incorrect, because she's a federal violation.

So, looking for the correct statement. The correct answer is E is incorrect. So, the correct statement is E is wrong, but perhaps another option is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is true. Let's go through each option.

Option E: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal laws. That's incorrect because she's a violation of federal laws.

Option B: Under the federal act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference. That's incorrect because she was allowed under diversity programs.

Option D: The woman's preference is considered discriminatory only if she refuses to rent to a qualified tenant based on race or gender. No, because the act allows for such preferences.

Option C: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal laws. E is incorrect.

Option I: The woman's actions are legal under the federal Fair Housing Act as long as she doesn't act on her preference. So, if she doesn't act, it's legal. So, this is correct.

Option E is incorrect.

So, the correct statement is I. So, the answer is I.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about another angle.

If the building doesn't have a diversity program, then her statement is a violation. But if it does, it's not. The question doesn't specify, but the building has one unit with an African American and another with a Pacific Islander, so the diversity program is likely available.

Thus, the woman's actions are legal if she doesn't act on them. So, statement I is correct.

So the correct answer is E is false, I is true. So the correct answer is E is incorrect, I is correct.

Wait, no, the question is which of the following is true.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is true. So, the correct answer is I: Her actions are legal as long as she doesn't act on her preference.

So, the correct answer is E is incorrect, I is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is I.
</think>

The question revolves around the implications of a woman's advertisement in a four-unit apartment building, where one tenant vacated and she placed an advertisement stating she preferred a mix of tenants, including one African American man and one Pacific Islander woman. The analysis focuses on the Fair Housing Act and its provisions regarding diversity and discrimination.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The Fair Housing Act does apply to private landlords, so this statement is false.

- **Option B**: Incorrect. The woman's statement about diversity is permissible under the act, as it aligns with diversity programs available in the building.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. The woman's actions are a violation of both state and federal laws, as the act prohibits discrimination without a legitimate basis.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the woman's preference is about diversity, it is not discriminatory if she refuses to rent based on race or gender; the act allows for such preferences.

- **Option E**: Incorrect. The woman's actions are a violation of federal laws, as she made a statement without a diversity program.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. The act prohibits discrimination, not that it is illegal.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. The woman's motive does not absolve her liability; she could be violating the act by refusing to rent based on her preferences.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. The act allows for diversity, so she is not violating it.

- **Option I**: Correct. The woman's actions are legal as long as she does not act on her preferences. The act does not restrict her from making the advertisement without acting on it.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **I**, as the woman's actions are legal under the federal Fair Housing Act as long as she does not act on her preferences.
