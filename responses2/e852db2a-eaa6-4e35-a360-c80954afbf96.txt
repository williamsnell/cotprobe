Okay, so I need to find the maximum height of a model rocket that's following a certain trajectory. The trajectory is given by the function c(t) = (80t, 200t - 4.9t²). Hmm, wait, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The rocket's position is given in two components: the x-component and the y-component. Since the rocket is moving in the x-direction, I guess that's horizontal, and the y-component is the vertical motion. 

Wait, but the problem specifically says to find the maximum height. So I think that refers to the vertical component. Because when you talk about maximum height, you're talking about the highest point it reaches in the vertical direction. So the y-component of the position function is what determines the height. 

Looking at the y-component: 200t - 4.9t². This is a quadratic equation, and since the coefficient of t² is negative (-4.9), the parabola opens downward. That means it has a maximum point, which is the vertex of the parabola. The vertex will give me the time at which the rocket reaches its maximum height, and then I can plug that back into the y-component to find the actual maximum height.

The general form of a quadratic equation is y = at² + bt + c. In this case, a is -4.9, b is 200, and c is 0 (since there's no constant term). The time t at which the vertex occurs is at t = -b/(2a). Let me compute that.

So t = -200/(2*(-4.9)) = -200 / (-9.8) = 200/9.8. Let me calculate that. 200 divided by 9.8 is approximately 20.408 seconds. So about 20.41 seconds is when the rocket is at its maximum height.

Now, to find the height, I substitute this time back into the y-component equation. So y = 200*(20.408) - 4.9*(20.408)^2.

Let me compute each term step by step. First, 200 times 20.408 is 200 * 20.408 = 4081.6 meters.

Now, the second term: 4.9 multiplied by (20.408)^2. Let's compute 20.408 squared. 20.408 * 20.408. Let's approximate. 20^2 is 400, 0.408^2 is about 0.166, and the cross term is 2*20*0.408 = 16.32. So total is approximately 400 + 16.32 + 0.166 ≈ 416.486. Let me compute it more accurately: 20.408 * 20.408. Let me do exact multiplication:

20.408 * 20.408: Let's compute 20 * 20 = 400, 20 * 0.408 = 8.16, 0.408 * 20 = 8.16, and 0.408 * 0.408 ≈ 0.166464.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute (a + b)^2 where a=20 and b=0.408. So (20 + 0.408)^2 = 20^2 + 2*20*0.408 + 0.408^2 = 400 + 16.32 + 0.166464 ≈ 416.486464.

So 4.9 times that is 4.9 * 416.486464. Let's compute that. 4 * 416.486464 is 1665.945856, and 0.9 * 416.486464 is about 374.8378176. Adding those together: 1665.945856 + 374.8378176 = 2040.7836736.

So the second term is approximately 2040.7836736 meters. Now, subtracting that from the first term, which was 4081.6 meters.

So 4081.6 - 2040.7836736 = 2040.8163264 meters. Hmm, around 2040.816 meters. Let me check if I made any calculation errors.

Wait, did I compute the second term correctly? Let me recalculate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, the y-component is 200t -4.9t². So at t=20.408, that's 200*20.408 -4.9*(20.408)^2.

Wait another approach: perhaps using exact calculation. Because the vertex occurs at t=200/(2*4.9) = 200/(9.8) ≈ 20.408163265306122 seconds.

So let's compute 200t: 200 * 20.408163265306122 = 4081.632653061224 meters.

Now, 4.9 * t²: 4.9 * (20.408163265306122)^2.

Wait, I think it's better to compute t² first. Let's compute t squared:

t = 200/9.8 = 2000/98 = 2000 ÷ 98. Let me compute 98 * 20 = 1960, so 2000-1960=40. So 20.408163265306122 = 20 + 40/98 = 20 + 20/49. So (20 + 20/49)^2 = 20^2 + 2*20*(20/49) + (20/49)^2 = 400 + 800/49 + 400/(49^2).

Calculating each term:

400 is 400.

800/49 is approximately 16.3265306122449.

400/(49^2) is 400/(2401) ≈ 0.1666666666666667.

Adding them together: 400 + 16.3265306122449 + 0.1666666666666667 ≈ 416.4931972789116.

So t² ≈ 416.4931972789116.

Multiply by 4.9: 4.9 * 416.4931972789116.

Well, 4 * 416.4931972789116 = 1665.9727891156464.

0.9 * 416.4931972789116 ≈ 374.8438775510204.

Adding these: 1665.9727891156464 + 374.8438775510204 ≈ 2040.8166666666668.

So the second term is approximately 2040.8166666666668 meters.

Now subtract this from the first term: 4081.632653061224 - 2040.8166666666668 = 2040.816663394557 meters.

Wait, that's approximately 2040.8167 meters. So about 2040.82 meters.

Looking at the options: The options are 2200, 1800, 2041, 2100, 2500, 1700, 1600, 1900, 1500, 2300, 2500.

So the closest is 2041 meters. Option C is 2041, so that's the answer.

To determine the maximum height of the model rocket, we analyze its trajectory. The rocket's vertical position is given by the y-component of the trajectory function: 

\[
y(t) = 200t - 4.9t^2.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( y = at^2 + bt + c \), where \( a = -4.9 \), \( b = 200 \), and \( c = 0 \). The maximum height occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is found using the time formula:

\[
t = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{200}{2(-4.9)} = \frac{200}{9.8} \approx 20.408 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Substituting this time back into the y-component equation:

\[
y = 200(20.408) - 4.9(20.408)^2.
\]

First, calculate \( 200(20.408) \approx 4081.6 \, \text{meters} \).

Next, calculate \( (20.408)^2 \approx 416.49 \), and then \( 4.9(416.49) \approx 2040.82 \, \text{meters} \).

Subtracting these values:

\[
y \approx 4081.6 - 2040.82 = 2040.78 \, \text{meters}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 2041 \, \text{meters} \).
