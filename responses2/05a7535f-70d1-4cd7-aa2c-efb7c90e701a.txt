Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of derivatives and vector operations. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem gives me a vector function r(t) = [ln(t^3 + 1), e^(-2t), t^2]. I need to find four things: the first derivative dr/dt, its magnitude at t=0, the second derivative d²r/dt², and its magnitude at t=0. Then I have to match these results to one of the options A to D.

Starting with the first part: finding dr/dt. I remember that the derivative of a vector function is found by differentiating each component separately.

So, let's break it down.

First component: ln(t^3 + 1). The derivative of ln(u) is 1/u * du/dt. Here, u is t^3 +1, so du/dt is 3t^2. So the derivative of the first component is (3t^2)/(t^3 +1).

Second component: e^(-2t). The derivative of e^{kt} is k e^{kt}, so here k is -2. So the derivative is -2 e^{-2t}.

Third component: t^2. The derivative is 2t.

So putting it all together, dr/dt = [3t^2/(t^3+1), -2 e^{-2t}, 2t].

Now, evaluate this at t=0.

First component at t=0: 3*(0)^2/(0^3 +1) = 0/1 = 0.

Second component at t=0: -2 e^{0} = -2 *1 = -2.

Third component at t=0: 2*0 = 0.

So dr/dt at t=0 is [0, -2, 0]. That's option A and C's first part.

Now moving to the second part: the magnitude of dr/dt at t=0. The magnitude is the square root of the sum of the squares of each component.

So |dr/dt| at t=0 is sqrt(0^2 + (-2)^2 +0^2) = sqrt(0 +4 +0) = sqrt(4) = 2. So magnitude is 2.

Looking at options A and C, their second parts are 2 and 3 respectively. So option C is 2, option A is 2 as well. Wait, no, wait: wait, option A's second part is 2, option C's second part is 3. Hmm, that's a problem because in option C the second part is 3, but the magnitude is 2. So in reality, the magnitude is 2, so any option that gives 2 in the second part is correct.

Wait, looking back. Wait, the problem says "1) (dr/dt) 2) |dr/dt| 3) [(d²r)/(dt²)] 4) |d²r/dt²| at t=0." So each part is a separate question.

Wait, no. Wait, the user wrote, "1) (dr/dt) 2) |dr/dt| 3) [(d²r) / (dt^2)] 4) |[(d²r) / (dt^2)]| at t=0."

Wait, no, that's a misunderstanding. Let me read again. The user wrote: "find 1) (dr/dt) 2)\vert(dr/dt)\vert 3) [(d^2r) / (dt^2)] 4)\vert[(d^2r) / (dt^2)]\vert att = 0."

Wait, that's probably a typo. It's more likely that each of these is a separate question. So the first part is dr/dt at t=0, the second is the magnitude of dr/dt at t=0, the third is the second derivative of r at t=0, and the fourth is the magnitude of the second derivative at t=0.

Wait, that's a bit more complicated. So let's break it down into four parts:

1) Compute dr/dt at t=0. We have that as [0, -2, 0]. So for option A, this is correct. Option C's first part is 0, -2, 0, so it's correct.

2) Find |dr/dt| at t=0. As calculated, it's 2. Looking at the options, options A and C have |dr/dt|=2. So that's correct.

3) Now compute d²r/dt² at t=0. Let's do the derivative of dr/dt.

dr/dt is [3t²/(t³+1), -2e^{-2t}, 2t].

So let's find the derivative of each component.

First component: 3t²/(t³+1). Using the quotient rule: ( (6t)(t³+1) - 3t^2*(3t^2) ) / (t³+1)^2. Simplify numerator: 6t(t³+1) =6t^4 +6t, and 3t^2*(3t^2)=9t^4. So numerator is (6t^4 +6t -9t^4)= (-3t^4 +6t). So the derivative is (-3t^4 +6t)/(t³+1)^2.

At t=0: numerator is 0, so derivative is 0/(1)^2=0.

Second component: derivative of -2e^{-2t} is 4 e^{-2t}.

At t=0: 4 *1=4.

Third component: derivative of 2t is 2.

So d²r/dt² at t=0 is [0,4,2].

So looking at the options, options A and C have [0,4,2] as the third part.

Option A's third part is (0,4,2), option C's is (1,4,2). So which one is correct?

Wait, wait, no: the third part is the second derivative, which for option C is (1,4,2). In our calculation, it's [0,4,2], so option A is correct for this part.

So if the third part is [0,4,2], then option A is correct.

Now, the fourth part: the magnitude of the second derivative at t=0. So |d²r/dt²| at t=0 is sqrt(0^2 +4^2 +2^2) = sqrt(0 +16 +4) = sqrt(20) = 2√5.

Looking at the options for the fourth part: option A gives √20, option C gives √20 as well. Because the fourth part is |d²r/dt²| at t=0, which is sqrt(0 +16 +4 )= sqrt(20).

So let's see which option has the fourth part as √20.

Option A: fourth part is √20.

Option C: same.

Wait, but earlier I thought the options for the third part were:

Option A: (0,4,2) → |third part| is sqrt(0+16+4)=sqrt(20).

Option C: (1,4,2) → sqrt(1+16+4)=sqrt(21), which is not 20.

Wait, no: the third part is [0,4,2], so the magnitude is sqrt(0^2 +4^2 +2^2)= sqrt(0+16+4)= sqrt(20). So option A's third part is correct, and so is the fourth part.

Wait, but why is option C's third part (1,4,2)? Because in option C, the third component is 2t, its derivative is 2, so the second derivative is 2. But according to our calculation, it's 0. Hmm, wait, no, in our calculation, the first component of the second derivative is 0. So the d²r/dt² vector is [0,4,2]. So option A is correct.

Wait, but I thought option C has the third part as (1,4,2). Did I miscalculate something? Let me re-calculate the second derivative's components.

First component: 3t²/(t^3+1). Let me recompute that.

f(t) = 3t²/(t^3 +1).

f’(t) using quotient rule: [ (6t)(t^3 +1) - 3t²*(3t²) ] / (t^3 +1)^2.

Numerator: 6t(t^3 +1) =6t^4 +6t.

Minus 9t^4: 6t^4 +6t -9t^4 = -3t^4 +6t.

So f’(t) is (-3t^4 +6t)/(t^3 +1)^2.

At t=0: numerator is 0, so f’(0)=0/(1)^2=0.

So first component of d²r/dt² is 0.

Third component: derivative of 2t is 2. So d²r/dt² at t=0 is 2, so third component is 2. So the vector is [0,4,2], which is option A's third part.

So, option A's third part is correct. So the correct option would have the third part [0,4,2] and the fourth part sqrt(20).

Looking at the options:

Option A: third part [0,4,2], fourth part sqrt(20). So that's our correct answer.

Option C's third part is [1,4,2], which is wrong because the first component is 1, but our calculation shows 0.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculating the second derivative?

Wait, let me recompute the second derivative.

Starting with dr/dt:

dr/dt = [ (3t²)/(t³ +1), -2 e^{-2t}, 2t ]

Compute d²r/dt²:

First component: derivative of 3t²/(t³ +1).

Using quotient rule: [ (6t)(t³ +1) - 3t² (3t²) ] / (t³ +1)^2.

So numerator: 6t(t³+1) = 6t^4 +6t. Minus 9t^4: 6t^4 +6t -9t^4 = -3t^4 +6t.

So the first component is (-3t^4 +6t)/(t³ +1)^2.

At t=0: numerator is 0, so this is 0.

Second component: derivative of -2e^{-2t} is 4e^{-2t}. At t=0, this is 4*1=4.

Third component: derivative of 2t is 2. So yes, the third component is 2. So d²r/dt² at t=0 is [0,4,2].

So, this matches option A's third part.

Fourth part is the magnitude of [0,4,2], which is sqrt(0+16+4)=sqrt(20). So option A's fourth part is sqrt(20), which matches.

So the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we compute the first and second derivatives of the vector function **r(t)** = [ln(t³ + 1), e⁻²ᵗ, t²] and evaluate them at t=0.

1. **First derivative dr/dt:**
   - The derivative of ln(t³ + 1) is (3t²)/(t³ + 1).
   - The derivative of e⁻²ᵗ is -2e⁻²ᵗ.
   - The derivative of t² is 2t.
   - Thus, **dr/dt** = [ (3t²)/(t³ + 1), -2e⁻²ᵗ, 2t ].

2. **Evaluate dr/dt at t=0:**
   - (3(0)²)/(0³ + 1) = 0.
   - -2e⁻²(0) = -2.
   - 2(0) = 0.
   - So, **dr/dt** at t=0 is [0, -2, 0].

3. **Magnitude of dr/dt at t=0:**
   - Magnitude = √(0² + (-2)² + 0²) = √4 = 2.

4. **Second derivative d²r/dt²:**
   - Derivative of (3t²)/(t³ + 1) is [(-3t⁴ + 6t)]/(t³ + 1)².
   - Derivative of -2e⁻²ᵗ is 4e⁻²ᵗ.
   - Derivative of 2t is 2.
   - Thus, **d²r/dt²** = [ (-3t⁴ + 6t)/(t³ + 1)², 4e⁻²ᵗ, 2 ].

5. **Evaluate d²r/dt² at t=0:**
   - (-3(0)⁴ + 6(0))/(0³ + 1)² = 0.
   - 4e⁻²(0) = 4.
   - 2.
   - So, **d²r/dt²** at t=0 is [0, 4, 2].

6. **Magnitude of d²r/dt² at t=0:**
   - Magnitude = √(0² + 4² + 2²) = √(0 + 16 + 4) = √20.

Comparing with the options, **option A** matches all calculations:
- **dr/dt** at t=0: [0, -2, 0].
- Magnitude of **dr/dt** at t=0: 2.
- **d²r/dt²** at t=0: [0, 4, 2].
- Magnitude of **d²r/dt²** at t=0: √20.
