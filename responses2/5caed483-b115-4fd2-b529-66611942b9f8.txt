Okay, so I have this economics question to answer. Let me read it again. The question is about why industries that produce capital goods and consumer durables are hit hardest during a recession. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that during a recession, businesses are probably struggling. Let's think about what each option means. 

Option A says postponability and monopoly power. I'm not sure about postponability. Maybe it's about delaying investments? Wait, but if a company is already producing capital goods, why would it be hit harder? Also, if a company has monopoly power, maybe they can set prices higher, but not sure how that affects production during a recession.

Option B is about high production costs. That makes sense because during a recession, demand decreases. If a company can't afford high production costs, they might cut back on production. But capital goods like machinery or equipment are usually produced by firms, so if costs are high, they might not be able to produce as much. But wait, consumer durables are probably also affected because they require investment, like new cars or houses. So if a company can't make those, they can't meet the demand, leading to lower sales and possibly fewer consumer durables.

Option C is inadequate infrastructure. I'm not sure how infrastructure affects this. Maybe if a company can't build the necessary facilities, they can't produce. But in a recession, maybe they can invest in more infrastructure, which could help in production. So I think this might not be the main issue.

Option D is lack of skilled labor. Skilled labor is crucial for producing both capital goods and consumer durables. During a recession, businesses might lay off workers if they can't hire enough. This would directly reduce production, which would hit both capital goods and consumer durables hardest.

Wait, but I'm not sure about option B. Production costs being high might help companies cut back, but maybe capital goods are more dependent on investment decisions. If a company can't pay for new machinery, it might not invest in it, leading to lower production. Similarly, consumer durables might not get new models, so sales drop.

But why is it hitting hardest? Maybe because capital goods and consumer durables are more expensive to produce. If production costs rise, firms might reduce their output, including both types, to pass on the higher costs to consumers.

Alternatively, during a recession, firms might not have the capacity to invest in new capital. So, they can't upgrade production facilities, leading to less investment. That would reduce both capital goods (like machinery) and consumer durables (like new cars or houses) because they can't buy new stuff.

Wait, but the question is about why they're hit hardest. If production costs are high, firms might lower their production levels, which would affect all types of goods, including durables. But I'm not certain if capital goods are a bigger hit than durables. Or maybe both are hit, but capital goods are more because they're more dependent on investment decisions.

Between B and D, I'm leaning towards B because high production costs directly affect the profitability of production. Without the ability to pay the high costs, firms might reduce production, leading to lower output in both categories.

Wait another thought: capital goods are often produced in large quantities, so if their production costs increase, it's more of a bottleneck. Firms might not be able to increase production, so they might decrease production, meaning less capital goods and less consumer durables. So the impact is the same, but maybe capital goods are hit harder because they're more expensive to produce in the first place.

Alternatively, maybe consumer durables are more affected because they're typically more expensive to produce. Or perhaps the primary issue is that they require more investment, so if firms can't pay the higher costs, they can't invest as much in them.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what causes firms to reduce production during a recession. Low demand, high costs, and possibly reduced investment. So, if a firm can't pay the higher production costs, they might not invest in new machinery or new models, leading to less production.

But why capital goods and consumer durables are hit hardest? Maybe because they're more dependent on production decisions. For capital goods, the cost might be a significant expense. For consumer durables, it's also a fixed cost but might be a more immediate expense.

Alternatively, high production costs might affect all types of goods, but capital goods might be more affected because they're more likely to be produced in large volumes. So, during a recession, when demand drops, firms might reduce their production of capital goods (like machinery, since they're needed for manufacturing high-tech products) and consumer durables (like new cars, which are more expensive and require significant investment).

So, the answer could be B because high production costs make it harder to produce these goods, leading to lower output both capital goods and consumer durables.

But I'm not too confident. Another angle: during a recession, firms might lay off workers if they can't find enough, which would affect all types of goods. So, option D, lack of skilled labor, would lead to lower production, which affects both durables and capital goods.

Alternatively, if production costs are high, maybe the firm can't keep up with the demand, so they cut back. So, high costs (B) would lead to lower production, which is the same impact as low skilled labor (D). But the question is about why they're hit hardest by production and employment.

Wait, the question states "hit hardest by a recession, insofar as production and employment are concerned." So, the focus is on production levels and employment levels. So, if production is lower, that's a hit harder.

But why would production be lower? High production costs would lead to lower profit margins, so firms might reduce production. Or perhaps they can't hire enough workers because of low demand, leading to lower employment.

I think the correct answer is B: High production cost. Because during a recession, firms can't afford to pay the high costs, leading them to reduce their production. That would directly hit both capital goods and consumer durables, as they are more dependent on production decisions.

Wait, no, capital goods might have higher costs because they're made in large quantities. So, high production costs would lead to lower production, which would hit both capital goods and consumer durables.

Alternatively, maybe capital goods are hit harder because they're more expensive to produce. For example, if a company can't sell its capital goods, they might not invest in new machinery, which could be a bottleneck. But I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about a company's production costs. If they can't manage to keep up with high costs, they might lay off workers. So, the answer would be D: Lack of skilled labor. Because without skilled workers, they can't produce goods, even if the cost is low.

Wait, but if production costs are high, maybe the company can't hire enough workers. So, perhaps both high production costs and lack of skilled labor would lead to lower production.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let's try to think about the options again.

A: Postponability and monopoly power. Not sure. Monopoly power might allow firms to set higher prices, but during a recession, lower demand might cause them to cut back. But I'm not certain why both capital goods and durables would be hit harder.

B: High production cost. If a company can't cover their high production costs, they might cut back on production. This would affect both capital goods and durables because they're produced in large quantities.

C: Inadequate infrastructure. If they can't build the necessary facilities, they can't invest in new machinery, which would reduce production. So, this affects capital goods and durables.

D: Lack of skilled labor. Without skilled workers, they can't produce goods, so both capital goods and durables would suffer.

Wait, but if production costs are high, the company can't hire enough workers. So, even if they could, low demand might lead to lower employment. But the question says "insofar as production and employment are concerned," so it's about production and employment.

Between B and D. If high production costs make it hard to produce, both capital goods and durables would be hit. If high production costs make it hard to hire workers, both capital goods and durables would be affected.

But why would capital goods be hit harder? Because it's a larger production volume. For example, if machinery is more expensive to produce, high costs might prevent the company from investing in it, even if it's necessary for manufacturing high-tech products. So, capital goods might face higher costs and be hit harder.

Alternatively, the impact on durables could be more immediate because they have lower production costs. For example, new cars have lower production costs than machinery, so a high cost in machinery production might hit capital goods less than consumer durables.

I'm getting a bit stuck. I'm going to go with option B: High production cost. Because during a recession, high production costs make it harder to reach demand, which directly affects both capital goods and consumer durables.

The question asks why industries producing capital goods and consumer durables are hit hardest during a recession, focusing on production and employment. Let's analyze the options:

- **Option A (Postponability and monopoly power):** While monotony might delay production, high production costs are more directly tied to profitability and firm decision-making, making this less likely the primary issue.

- **Option B (High production cost):** During a recession, high production costs make it difficult for firms to cover their expenses, leading to reduced production. This impacts both capital goods (e.g., machinery) and consumer durables (e.g., new cars) because they require significant investment. Firms might cut back on production to avoid losses, making high production costs a significant factor.

- **Option C (Inadequate infrastructure):** Inadequate infrastructure could prevent investment in new machinery or housing, reducing production capacity. This would directly affect both capital goods and durables.

- **Option D (Lack of skilled labor):** Low skilled labor could hinder production, leading to reduced output. However, during a recession, firms might not be able to find enough workers, which could also lower employment levels and thus production.

Between B and D, high production costs (B) and low skilled labor (D) are both plausible explanations. However, high production costs directly impact profitability and firm behavior, making it the more likely answer. Companies under high production costs may reduce production to avoid losses, which affects both capital goods and durables.
