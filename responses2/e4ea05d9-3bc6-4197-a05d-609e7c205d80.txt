Okay, so I have this problem about candy bars and their calorie content. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that the average number of calories in Yum-Yum Good candy bars is 210, and the standard deviation is 10. They want to know what percent of candy bars have more than 225 calories. And the number is normally distributed. Hmm, right, so I remember that normal distributions are bell-shaped curves, and we can use the z-score to find probabilities.

First, I need to find the z-score for 225 calories. The z-score formula is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we're interested in, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. Plugging in the numbers: X is 225, μ is 210, and σ is 10. So z = (225 - 210)/10 = 15/10 = 1.5.

Now, I need to find the probability that a candy bar has more than 225 calories, which is the same as finding the area under the normal curve to the right of z = 1.5. I think I can find this by looking up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table or using a calculator.

Wait, standard normal tables give the area to the left of the z-score. So if z is 1.5, the area to the left is about 0.9332. That means 93.32% of the data is below 225 calories. But the question is asking for more than 225, so I subtract that from 100% to get the area to the right. So 100% - 93.32% = 6.68%.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.68%. So the correct answer should be C.

The correct answer is **C: 6.68%**.
