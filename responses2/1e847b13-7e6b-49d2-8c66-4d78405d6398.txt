Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about the effect on the average price level when real GNP is growing at a steady 2 percent annual rate and the nominal money stock is growing at 5 percent. The velocity of circulation of money is unchanged. Hmm. So I remember something about the quantity theory of money.

Wait, the quantity theory of money equation is M*V = P*Y, right? Where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Y is the real GDP. Oh wait, but sometimes people use M for money supply and Y for real GDP. So the equation is M * V = PY?

Yes, I think that's correct. And in that equation, if M increases and V increases, but PY is related to the price level. Wait, so if V is unchanged, then any change in M will directly affect PY, which is P times Y.

But wait, our question is about the average price level, which is P. So let's think about it.

The problem says real GNP is growing at 2% annually, and the nominal money stock is growing at 5% annually. So, real GNP is Y, which is growing by 2%, so Y is Y0*(1.02)^t. The money stock M is growing at 5%, so M = M0*(1.05)^t.

The velocity V is unchanged. So V is V0 for all time.

We can rearrange the quantity equation to solve for P: P = (M * V) / Y.

Since V is constant, any change in M and Y will affect P. So let's compute the growth rate of P.

The growth rate of P (dP/dt) is equal to growth rate of M + growth rate of V - growth rate of Y. Wait, no, because M and V are multiplied, and Y is in the denominator. So the equation for P is M*V / Y. So the growth rate of P would be the sum of the growth rates of M and V minus the growth rate of Y.

Wait, let me think again. If P = (M*V)/Y, then the growth rate of P is the sum of the growth rates of M and V minus the growth rate of Y. Because M and V are multiplied (so their growth rates add), and Y is divided, so their growth rate subtracts.

So the growth rate of P is (5% - 2%) = 3%? Because M grows by 5%, V is unchanged (so that's +5%), and Y grows by 2%, which is subtracted. So the net effect is a 3% increase in P.

Wait, but wait. The question says the real GNP is expanding at 2% and the nominal money stock at 5%. So V is unchanged. So the price level is growing by 5% plus V's effect (which is zero, since V is constant) minus real GDP's growth rate (2%). So 5% - 2% = 3%.

So the price level increases by 3% annually. Looking at the options, option I is 3 percent increase. So the answer should be I.

The quantity theory of money equation is expressed as \( M \cdot V = P \cdot Y \), where \( M \) is the money supply, \( V \) is the velocity of money, \( P \) is the price level, and \( Y \) is real GDP. Here, \( V \) is constant, \( M \) grows at 5% annually, and \( Y \) grows at 2% annually. 

To find the growth rate of the price level \( P \), we rearrange the equation to \( P = \frac{M \cdot V}{Y} \). The growth rate of \( P \) is therefore the sum of the growth rates of \( M \) and \( V \) minus the growth rate of \( Y \). Since \( V \) is constant, its growth rate is zero. Thus, the growth rate of \( P \) is \( 5\% - 2\% = 3\% \).

The correct answer is that the average price level increases by 3 percent annually.
