Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about limits of sequences and bounded subsequences. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first statement says: "Suppose {s_n} and {t_n} are sequences of complex numbers such that the limit as n approaches infinity of s_n is s and the limit as n approaches infinity of t_n is t. Then the limit as n approaches infinity of s_n times t_n is st." Hmm, I remember something about the product of limits. I think this is true because when dealing with limits, the limit of a product is the product of the limits, provided both limits exist. So in complex numbers, this should hold as well. So Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: "There exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence." Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think every bounded sequence in real numbers has a convergent subsequence because of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. Oh, wait, that's actually the case for real numbers. So if a sequence is bounded, it has a convergent subsequence. So this statement is saying the opposite, implying that there's a bounded sequence without a convergent subsequence. But by Bolzano-Weierstrass, that's impossible. So Statement 2 is False.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. Looking at the options, option E is False, not enough info, but wait, no, in the options, the cases for Statement 2 are all False, except possibly if there's a nuance I'm missing. Since Statement 2 is definitely false, the options are E: False, not enough info (but neither statement 1 or 2 requires more info). So the answer is E.

The first statement is true because the product of the limits of two sequences is the limit of their product. The second statement is false because a bounded sequence in real numbers must have a convergent subsequence. Therefore, the correct option is:

E: False, Not enough information (but neither statement 1 nor 2 requires more info). 

**Answer: E**
