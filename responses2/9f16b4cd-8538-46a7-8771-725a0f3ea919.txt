Okay, so I've got this problem here about fencing a rectangular yard. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that a total of x feet of fencing is used to form three sides of a level rectangular yard. I need to find the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, first, I should visualize the problem. Since it's a rectangular yard, there are two lengths and two widths. But wait, the problem says three sides are formed with the fencing. So, depending on which sides are being fenced, the setup can vary. Let's think about the possible configurations.

If the yard is a rectangle, there are two possibilities: either two lengths and one width are fenced, or one length and two widths are fenced. But the problem doesn't specify which sides, so I might need to assume both cases and see which one gives the maximum area.

Wait, but maybe the problem is implying that the yard is a rectangle, and the fencing forms three sides. So, perhaps it's a square or rectangle with two sides of one length and one of the other. But it's not clear. Oh, wait, maybe the yard is a rectangle with two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. But since the problem doesn't specify which sides, perhaps the maximum area is the same in both cases, so I can proceed under that assumption.

Let me denote the length as L and the width as W. Since the yard is rectangular, the fencing forms three sides, so let's say we have fencing on the front, one side, and the back. So, the fencing is the front (length L), one side (width W), and the back (another length L). So the total fencing is L + W + L = 2L + W = x.

Alternatively, if the yard is fenced on the front, two sides (two widths), and the back, it would be W + 2W + L = 3W + L = x. Wait no, that's not right. Wait, no, if the front is a single length, then the other two sides would each be widths. So, for that scenario, the fencing would be 2 widths and 1 length: W + W + L = 2W + L = x. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the problem specifies which sides are being fenced. Alternatively, maybe the problem only gives three sides, but it's unclear which sides. Perhaps the problem is that the yard is a rectangle, and three sides are fenced, so the fencing is either the two widths and one length, or the two lengths and one width.

But wait, in either case, the maximum area would be the same, right? Because regardless of whether it's two widths and a length or two lengths and a width, the problem is symmetric. So, let me proceed under the assumption that the fencing is on two widths and one length. So, 2W + L = x. Then, the area A is L * W. I need to express A in terms of x, and find its maximum.

Wait, but perhaps another scenario: if the fencing is two lengths and one width, then the equation would be 2L + W = x, and the area is L * W. Either way, whether I choose the scenario where two widths and a length or two lengths and a width, the problem is symmetric, so the maximum area will be the same. So, I can proceed with either case, but perhaps I should think more carefully.

Wait, so in the first case, sides are W (width), W (width), and L (length). So fencing = 2W + L = x. The area is A = L * W. I need to express A in terms of x. Alternatively, in the other case, fencing = 2L + W = x, area is A = L * W. So, in both cases, the area is A = W * L, but the equation is different.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum area is the same in both cases. Let me think. Let's take the first scenario: 2W + L = x, so L = x - 2W. Substitute into area: A = (x - 2W) * W = xW - 2W². To find the maximum, take derivative with respect to W: dA/dW = x -4W. Setting to zero: x -4W=0 → W= x/4.

So, W= x/4. Then L = x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2. So the area is A = (x/2)*(x/4) = x²/8. Wait, that's one of the options. Looking back, option D is x²/8. So that's the maximum area.

Wait, but what if the fencing is arranged as two lengths and one width? Let's see. Then, 2L + W = x. So W = x - 2L. Area A = L * W = L*(x - 2L) = xL - 2L². Take derivative: dA/dL = x -4L. Setting to zero, x -4L=0 → L= x/4.

Then W = x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2= x/2. So the area is again L * W = (x/4)*(x/2) = x²/8. Same result. So regardless of the configuration (whether it's two widths and a length or two lengths and a width), the maximum area is x²/8, which is option D.

Wait, but let me check if there's any other configuration where the maximum area is larger. For example, what if all three sides are fenced with two widths and one length, which is the same as before. Alternatively, what if the fencing is arranged as two widths and one length, same as the first scenario.

So, in both cases, the maximum area is x²/8, which is option D. The other options don't make sense because, for example, option E is x²/4, which is bigger and would be the case if we had four sides, but since the problem has three sides, the maximum area must be less than that.

Wait, but does that make sense? Let me think. For a rectangle with three sides fenced, the maximum area is x²/8. So, the answer should be D.

The problem involves maximizing the area of a rectangular yard with three sides fenced using x feet of fencing. The solution considers two configurations (two widths and one length, or two lengths and one width) and finds that the maximum area is achieved when the area is x²/8. This corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
