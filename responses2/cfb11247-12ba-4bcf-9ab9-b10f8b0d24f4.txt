Okay, so I've got this question about the noise bandwidth of a system. Hmm, let me see. The power transfer function is given as |H(ω)|² = 1/[1 + (ω/B)²]. I remember that B is the 3-dB bandwidth in radians per second. 

Wait, noise bandwidth is related to the system's transfer function. I think the noise bandwidth is the integral of the power spectral density over all frequencies. Or wait, maybe it's just the 3-dB bandwidth scaled by some constant factor. Oh right, the noise bandwidth formula is typically the 3-dB bandwidth multiplied by some constant. 

Wait, no, wait. The noise figure formula involves the 3-dB bandwidth. Oh, right! The noise bandwidth B_N is often equal to π times the 3-dB bandwidth B. Because the power spectral density is proportional to |H|^2, and when you integrate that, you get something with π, but wait, wait. Let me think again.

The power spectral density of a system is given by |H(ω)|². The noise bandwidth is the integral of the noise spectral density over all frequencies. Oh wait, the noise spectral density is |H(ω)|² divided by some factor. Or is it that the noise bandwidth is the area under the noise spectral density curve when integrated over all frequencies. 

Wait, the noise spectral density at a frequency ω is |H(ω)|² multiplied by (1/(2π)) or something? Or wait, perhaps the noise spectral density is given as (|H(ω)|²) divided by 2π. Because the power spectral density is usually in units of power per radian frequency (like Watts/(rad/s)), and the noise spectral density is that divided by 2π, because noise is a random process.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's think about the noise bandwidth formula. I recall that the noise bandwidth B_N is equal to the 3-dB bandwidth B multiplied by π. Because when you calculate the integral of the noise spectral density, which is |H(ω)|²/(2π), the integral from 0 to infinity would give something like π B. Because the power transfer function is 1/(1 + (ω/B)^2), so |H(ω)|² is 1/(1 + (ω²)/(B²)).

Wait, the power spectral density S(ω) is |H(ω)|²/(2π), right? Or is it just |H(ω)|²? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to derive the noise bandwidth.

The noise spectral density is the derivative of the noise power with respect to frequency, or equivalently, since the noise power over a frequency interval dω is |H(ω)|² dω. So the noise bandwidth is the integral of |H(ω)|² times dω from 0 to infinity.

Wait, no, wait. Or is it the integral of |H(ω)|² * (1/(2π)) dω? Or perhaps the integral of |H(ω)|² dω, because the noise spectral density is |H(ω)|² times (1/(2π)).

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the specific function given: |H(ω)|² = 1/(1 + (ω/B)^2). So this is the magnitude squared of the transfer function. The noise spectral density is proportional to the square of the transfer function, but since power is energy per time, and noise is a random process, the noise spectral density is S(ω) = |H(ω)|² / (2π), I think.

Wait, no. Wait, the noise spectral density is the derivative of the noise power with respect to frequency. So if the noise power is the integral of |H(ω)|² dω, then the noise spectral density is |H(ω)|², because the integral of that over dω is the power. So wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing. The noise spectral density is the power per unit frequency. So if the noise power is the integral of |H(ω)|² dω, then the noise spectral density per unit frequency is |H(ω)|². Wait, that can't be right because the units would then be power per radian frequency, but the standard units for power spectral density (PSD) are power per radian frequency. Wait, no, wait, power spectral density is usually in watts per hertz, but in terms of frequency, it's in terms of rad/s.

Wait, let me correct that. The power spectral density is S(ω) = |H(ω)|², but in units of power per radian frequency (Watt/(rad/s)). So, integrating S(ω) dω gives power, which is in Watts. So the noise bandwidth B_N is the integral of S(ω) dω from 0 to ∞. But wait, that's the definition of the system's noise bandwidth? Or is the noise bandwidth calculated differently?

Wait, I think the noise bandwidth is defined as the integral of the noise spectral density over a certain range of frequencies. So B_N = ∫ S(ω) dω from 0 to ∞. Since S(ω) is |H(ω)|², which is 1/(1 + (ω²/B²)), the integral becomes ∫ [1/(1 + (ω²/B²))] dω from 0 to ∞.

Wait, I think that integral is known. Let me compute it.

Let me set x = ω / B. Then ω = Bx, dω = B dx.

So the integral becomes ∫ [1/(1 + x²)] * B dx from x=0 to x=∞.

The integral of 1/(1 + x^2) dx from 0 to ∞ is π/2. So the integral becomes B * (π/2) ) = (B π)/2.

Wait, but wait a second, that's the integral of S(ω) dω, which is the noise bandwidth. So B_N = (B π)/2.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the 3-dB bandwidth is B, and the noise bandwidth is π times B divided by 2? Or wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the 3-dB bandwidth is the frequency at which the power is half of the maximum (which is at ω=0). So the maximum power is at ω=0, which for this function is 1/(1+0)=1. So at ω=0, |H|^2=1. The 3-dB point is where |H|^2 is 1/2. So solving 1/(1 + (ω/B)^2) = 1/2 → 1 + (ω/B)^2 = 2 → (ω/B)^2 =1 → ω = B. So that's where the 3-dB point is. So the 3-dB bandwidth is B.

Now, the integral of S(ω) dω, which is the noise bandwidth, is (B π)/2. Because the integral from 0 to ∞ of [1/(1 + (ω/B)^2)] dω = (π B)/2.

Wait, so B_N = (π B)/2. So B_N equals (π/2) times B. Which is approximately (1.57) * B. So B_N is about 1.57 times the 3-dB bandwidth. But wait, the 3-dB bandwidth is B, so B_N is (π/2) * B. Or, more precisely, B_N = (π/2) * B.

So wait, the question asks for the noise bandwidth in terms of the 3-dB bandwidth. So if B is the 3-dB bandwidth, then B_N is (π/2) times B.

π is approximately 3.1416, so π/2 is about 1.5708. So that's roughly 1.57 times B.

Looking at the options, option E says "B_N is 0.77 times smaller than the system 3-dB bandwidth." Wait, that would mean B_N = B * 0.77 → which is about 0.77 B. That's not matching our calculation. Wait, no, wait. Because if B is the 3-dB, then B_N is (π/2) * B, which is approximately 1.57 times B. So B_N is 1.57 times B. So the correct answer should be E is 0.77 times smaller? Wait no, wait. 1.57 times larger than B.

Wait, let me rephrase. The question says, "the noise bandwidth B_N. Note: B is the 3-dB bandwidth in radians/second and ω is the angular frequency." So, the options.

Option E: B_N is 0.77 times smaller than the system 3-dB bandwidth. So this would mean B_N = B * 0.77.

Wait, but our calculation gives B_N = (π/2) * B. π/2 is about 1.57, so B_N is 1.57 times B. So this is greater than B. So none of the options directly state that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: B_N is equal to the square root of the system 3-dB bandwidth. Square root of B is B^(1/2), which would be much smaller than 1.57 B, so no.

Option B: B_N is equal to the system 3-dB bandwidth. That would mean B_N = B. But our calculation shows B_N is larger. So no.

Option C: B_N is 1.57 times larger than B. So that would be B_N = 1.57 B. Which matches our calculation. So option C would be correct.

Wait, option C says "B_N is 1.57 times larger than B." So that's correct. Because 1.57 times B is our result.

But let me double-check. Let's compute the integral again.

The integral of 1/(1 + (ω/B)^2) dω from 0 to infinity.

Wait, let me do substitution again. Let x = ω/B => ω = Bx, dω = B dx.

The integral becomes ∫ [1/(1 + x²)] * B dx from x=0 to x=∞.

The integral of 1/(1+x^2) dx is arctan(x) evaluated from 0 to ∞. Which is π/2 - 0 = π/2.

So the integral becomes B * (π/2) → (B π)/2. So B_N = (π/2) B.

Which is approximately 1.5708 * B. So yes, that's 1.57 times B.

So the correct answer is option C: B_N is 1.57 times larger than the system 3-dB bandwidth.

Looking at the options, the only one that matches this is option C. The other options don't align. Option E says B_N is 0.77 times smaller, which would imply B_N = 0.77 B. But that's not correct. So option C is correct.

To determine the noise bandwidth \( B_N \) of the system, we start with the given power transfer function:

\[
|H(\omega)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{\omega}{B}\right)^2}.
\]

The noise bandwidth \( B_N \) is defined as the integral of the noise spectral density over all frequencies. The noise spectral density is proportional to the magnitude squared of the transfer function, \( |H(\omega)|^2 \). Integrating this over all frequencies gives the noise bandwidth:

\[
B_N = \int_{0}^{\infty} |H(\omega)|^2 d\omega.
\]

Substituting \( |H(\omega)|^2 \):

\[
B_N = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{\omega}{B}\right)^2} d\omega.
\]

Using the substitution \( x = \frac{\omega}{B} \) (or \( \omega = Bx \), \( d\omega = B dx \)), the integral becomes:

\[
B_N = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \cdot B dx.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \) from 0 to \( \infty \) is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \). Thus:

\[
B_N = B \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) as \( \approx 1.57 \), we find:

\[
B_N = 1.57 B.
\]

This means the noise bandwidth \( B_N \) is **1.57 times larger than the system's 3-dB bandwidth \( B \)**. Among the given options, this corresponds to **Option C**.
