Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the growth rate of average incomes in less developed countries from 1960 to 1995. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the question is asking about the growth rate, specifically over a 35-year period. The options are a bunch of different percentages and comparisons. I need to figure out which one is correct.

I think less developed countries were experiencing rapid economic growth during this time. Maybe something like the 1960s and 1970s when developed countries were growing faster. I recall that countries like the Czech Republic, Japan, and South Korea had high growth rates. 

Wait, the options mention 3.0% per year, which sounds familiar. I think the World Bank or some reports might have mentioned that during that period, less developed countries were growing at around 3-4% annually. So if I look at the options, B says 5.0%, which feels a bit high. Maybe the exact rate is around 3.0.

Looking at the options again: A is zero, which doesn't make sense because those countries were growing. D says they were the same as high income countries, but high-income countries grew faster, so that's probably wrong. E suggests they exceeded high income, which might not be the case if the growth was around 3.0.

F says 1.5%, which seems too low. I don't think that's right because I remember countries like the US or Canada growing more in the 1960s. G talks about exceeding Britain during the industrial revolution. I think that's a different period, maybe earlier, so probably not relevant here.

H is negative, which doesn't fit with the growth I was thinking of. I is less than high income, which would align with the 3.0% figure. J is less than Britain during the industrial revolution, which also doesn't fit.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be B or I. But wait, the options are individual choices, so if the growth rate was approximately 3.0%, then B would be the answer. Alternatively, if it was less than high income, which is 3.0%, then I is correct. 

I think the growth rate was around 3.0%, so the best choice is B. That would mean the correct answer is B: was approximately 5.0% per year. Wait, no, I thought 3.0 is B, and 5.0 is not correct. Wait, but the option B is 5.0%, which I'm not sure about. Let me think again. Maybe the growth was around 3% so B would be correct. 

Alternatively, if the growth was about 3% per year, then B is correct. Because 5% is a higher rate, and I don't think less developed countries grew that fast in the 1960s. So the answer is B.

The correct answer is B: was approximately 5.0% per year. However, upon reflection, this might not be accurate, as the growth rate during the 1960s was around 3.0% per year. The closest option is B, which states 5.0%, but this might overestimate the growth. 

Answer: B
