Question:

A contractor agreed to remodel a homeowner's garage for $5,000. Just before the parties signed the one-page written contract, the homeowner called to the contractor's attention the fact that the contract did not specify a time of completion. The parties orally agreed but did not specify in the contract that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days, and then they both signed the contract. The contract did not contain a merger clause. The contractor failed to finish the work in 60 days. The homeowner has sued the contractor for breach of contract. Is the court likely to admit evidence concerning the parties' oral agreement that the work would be completed in 60 days?

Options:

A: No, because the oral agreement contradicts the written contract.
B: Yes, because the homeowner brought up the time limit before signing the contract.
C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.
D: Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.
E: No, because the oral agreement is considered hearsay.
F: No, because the contract is a fully integrated written contract.
G: Yes, because the court can consider oral agreements in absence of a merger clause.
H: No, because the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the terms of the written contract.
I: Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.
J: No, because the oral agreement was merely part of the parties' negotiations.

Okay, so I have this law question about contracts and evidence. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is: a contractor agreed to remodel a garage for $5,000. Before the parties signed the contract, the homeowner called and pointed out that the contract didn't specify a completion time. Then, they orally agreed, but didn't put it in the contract. They both signed the contract, which didn't have a merger clause. The contractor didn't finish the work in 60 days, and the homeowner sued for breach. The question is whether the court can admit evidence of their oral agreement that the work would be done in 60 days.

Hmm, I remember that contracts can be written or oral, and certain types of contracts are considered integrated. An integrated contract is one where the written and oral parts are clearly connected. If there's a merger clause, which is a clause that prevents the written and oral parts from being considered separate, then the court must enforce the contract as a whole.

In this case, there's no mention of a merger clause, so it's safe to assume it's not present. The contractor's oral agreement is part of their negotiations and likely integrated with the written contract. 

The key here is whether the oral agreement can be treated as evidence in the contract. I think that if the contract is integrated, and there's a time limit specified, the court should consider that time limit as part of the contract.

But wait, the question is specifically about the oral agreement's evidence. So, the homeowners brought up the time limit before signing the contract. So, they can present that time limit as part of the contract.

Wait, another point: sometimes, if a contract has a written term and an oral term, the written term can be considered part of the contract, and the oral term is part of the oral agreement, which is treated as part of the contract. But if the oral and written parts are clearly connected (integrated), the court doesn't have to consider the oral part separately.

So, the question is whether the oral agreement's time limit can be admitted. The homeowners have already notified the contractor of the time limit, so they can provide evidence of the oral agreement's time.

Looking at the options, option B says yes because the homeowner brought the time limit before signing. Option C says yes because the homeowner can provide evidence. Option G is about ambiguity, but the time limit is a clear term. Option I says the contract is ambiguous, but it's not about that.

Wait, another point: in some cases, the written contract can be treated as a contract with the oral agreement. But if the written contract already includes the time limit, then perhaps the time is already part of it. But the contractor didn't finish in 60 days, so the homeowner is suing for breach.

So, can the court admit the oral agreement's time limit as part of the contract? The fact that the contract didn't specify it should allow the court to consider it, as it's an oral agreement. So the answer would be B or C.

Wait, let me think again. The written contract didn't specify the time. The parties orally agreed. So the written contract probably was just the terms, and the oral agreement is part of the contract. So the written contract would be treated as part of the contract, but the oral agreement would be treated as part of the contract as well.

Wait, but the question is whether the contractor's oral agreement can be admitted as evidence. Since there's no merger clause, the court can treat the oral agreement as part of the contract. So the contractor's oral agreement is part of the contract for 60 days. So the homeowners can bring that up as evidence.

So the contractor's time limit is part of the contract, so the court can admit the evidence. Therefore, the correct answer is C or B? Let me look at the options.

Option B says yes, because the homeowner brought up the time limit before signing. Option C says yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.

Wait, the question is about whether the court likely admits evidence concerning the parties' oral agreement. Since the parties orally agreed, the contractor's oral agreement is part of the contract, and the homeowners can provide evidence. So the court can admit that oral agreement as part of the contract.

So the answer would be C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.

Wait, but I'm confused because some sources say that in contracts, the time limit is part of the written contract. But if the contract is written, the time might be included. But in this case, the contract didn't specify, so the oral agreement is part of the contract.

Alternatively, the written contract may not include the time, so the oral agreement is part of the contract.

But the question is whether the court can admit evidence of the oral agreement. So the homeowners called and told the contractor about the time limit, so they can provide that as evidence.

So the correct answer is C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about whether the oral agreement can be treated as part of a contract. If the written contract didn't specify and there's no merger clause, the contract would be written with an oral agreement. So the time limit is part of the contract, so the court can admit the evidence.

So yes, the court can admit the evidence. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, some argue that the written contract is treated as part of the contract, but that might not necessarily mean that the time limit is part of the written contract. So the oral agreement is part of the contract, and the written contract is just the term. So the time limit is part of the contract as an oral agreement.

Wait, but the written contract doesn't specify. So perhaps the time is part of the oral agreement. In that case, the written contract might not include the time, but the oral agreement does. So the contract is a combination of the written and oral parts.

But the problem is, I'm not sure. Another approach is to remember that if the written contract specifies a time, that is part of the contract. If it doesn't, then the time is an oral term and is part of the contract.

But in this case, the written contract didn't specify. So the time is an oral term. So the contract is the written contract plus the oral agreement.

Wait, but the written contract is an integral part of the contract, meaning that it's only about the specified terms. So the time is part of the oral agreement, which is treated as part of the contract.

So the oral agreement is part of the contract, so the court can admit evidence of that.

So the correct answer is C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.

Alternatively, if the written contract is only the terms, and the oral agreement is separate, then the written contract wouldn't include the time. So the time is part of the oral agreement, which is treated as part of the contract. Therefore, the court can admit the evidence.

So, the answer is either B or C. But option B says the time was brought up before signing, which is probably true. So the answer is C, because the parties orally agreed, and the time is part of the contract.

Wait, but the options for the answer are B and C. Let's read the options again.

Option B: Yes, because the homeowner brought up the time limit before signing the contract.

Option C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.

So which is correct? The contractor's oral agreement is part of the contract for 60 days. So the homeowners can bring that up as evidence. So the court can admit that.

I think the correct answer is C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.

But wait, another angle: some argue that if the written contract includes a time term, that's part of the contract. But in this case, the contract didn't specify, so the time is part of the oral agreement. So the written contract is only the terms, and the oral agreement is part of the contract. So the contract is a written contract plus an oral agreement. Therefore, the time is part of the oral agreement, which is part of the contract.

So the court can treat the oral agreement as part of the contract because it's not a merger clause. Therefore, the time is part of the contract, so the evidence can be admitted. So option C is correct.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around whether the court can admit evidence of the parties' oral agreement that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days. The scenario involves a contractor agreeing to remodel a garage for $5,000, a written contract that did not specify a 60-day completion time, and an oral agreement that both parties orally agreed to but did not include in the contract. The contractor failed to meet the 60-day deadline, leading to a breach of contract.

Key points to consider:

1. **Contract Structure**: The written contract did not specify a 60-day completion time, while the parties orally agreed. This integration suggests that the contract is a combination of the written terms and the oral agreement.

2. **Merger Clause**: The absence of a merger clause implies that the written and oral parts of the contract are not considered separate. Therefore, the oral agreement is treated as part of the contract.

3. **Evidence Possibility**: The homeowners called before signing the contract and notified the contractor of the time limit. This communication allows them to provide evidence of the oral agreement.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. While the homeowners can bring up the time limit, the court cannot simply accept it as written unless the written contract includes it, which it does not.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The court can admit evidence of the oral agreement because it is not a merger clause, and the contract is considered integrated.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The court does not need to consider the oral agreement as ambiguous in this case since the parties clearly agreed.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. There is no indication that the oral agreement was merely part of negotiations; it was explicitly oral.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. There is no requirement that the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the contract.
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The oral agreement does contradict the written contract.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The time limit is an additional term and not an element of the written contract.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The written contract could be ambiguous, but the time limit is explicitly stated.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The contract is fully integrated as it includes both written and oral terms.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The court cannot determine the meaning from the contract terms alone; the oral agreement is considered part of the contract.

Given the absence of a merger clause and the parties' clear oral agreement, the court can admit evidence of the oral agreement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: C
