Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a mass-spring system. Hmm, let me think. The question says that one end of a horizontal, massless spring is attached to a wall, and a mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end. The mass is displaced 0.030 meters from equilibrium and released. It passes through the equilibrium position with a speed of 0.040 m/s. They want the total mechanical energy in the absence of friction.

Wait, mechanical energy in a simple harmonic oscillator system should be conserved, right? Because there's no friction or air resistance, so energy stays the same. So the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

But wait, when the mass is at the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero. Right, because the spring is neither stretched nor compressed. So the mechanical energy at that point is just the kinetic energy.

Oh, so if I can find the kinetic energy at equilibrium, that should give me the total mechanical energy. Because at equilibrium, the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic.

So the kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². Let me plug in the numbers. Mass m is 0.30 kg, velocity v is 0.040 m/s.

Calculating that: (0.5) * 0.30 kg * (0.040)^2.

Wait, let me compute (0.040)^2 first. 0.04 squared is 0.0016. So 0.30 * 0.0016 is 0.00048. Multiply by 0.5, gives 0.00024 J. Wait, that's 240 mJ? But wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.5 * 0.30 * 0.0016.

Wait, let me re-calculate: 0.30 * 0.04 = 0.012, squared is 0.000144? Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Wait no, the velocity squared is 0.040^2 = 0.0016. So 0.30 kg * 0.0016 m²/s² = 0.00048 kg·m²/s², which is 0.00048 J. Then multiply by 0.5: 0.00048 * 0.5 = 0.00024 J. So that's 0.24 millijoules, right? Because 1 J is 1000 mJ. So 0.00024 J is 0.24 mJ.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, 0.30 * 0.04 is 0.012. Then 0.012 squared is 0.000144. Multiply by 0.5: 0.000072. Oh wait wait, maybe I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, another approach: (0.5) * m * v². So 0.5 * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2.

So compute 0.040 squared: 0.0016. Multiply by 0.30: 0.00048. Multiply by 0.5: 0.00024. So that's 0.00024 J, which is 0.24 mJ. So the total mechanical energy is 0.24 mJ.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.24 mJ. So the answer should be C.

Wait, alternatively, another approach: The maximum potential energy is when the mass is at the amplitude (maximum displacement). But in this case, the given data is the kinetic energy at equilibrium, so the total energy is equal to that, since at equilibrium, all energy is K.E. So yes, correct.

To determine the total mechanical energy of the system, we use the fact that mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of friction. The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy (KE) and the potential energy (PE) at any point in the oscillation. At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, so the total mechanical energy is equal to the kinetic energy at that point.

The kinetic energy is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

where \( m = 0.30 \, \text{kg} \) and \( v = 0.040 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting these values:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.30 \cdot (0.040)^2
\]

First, calculate \( (0.040)^2 = 0.0016 \). Then:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.30 \cdot 0.0016 = 0.5 \cdot 0.30 \cdot 0.0016 = 0.00024 \, \text{J}
\]

Since the total mechanical energy is equal to the kinetic energy at the equilibrium position, the total mechanical energy is:

\[
E = 0.00024 \, \text{J} = 0.24 \, \text{mJ}
\]

Thus, the total mechanical energy of the system is \( 0.24 \, \text{mJ} \), which corresponds to option C.
