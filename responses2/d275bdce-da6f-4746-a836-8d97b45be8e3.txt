Okay, so I've got this economics question here about marginal propensity to consume and the total increase in GDP from an increase in spending. Let me see if I can figure this out.

The question says that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8. We're given an increase of $500 in new spending, and we need to find the largest total increase in GDP possible. The options are A through J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that the marginal propensity to consume is the proportion of additional income that people spend on consumption. So, if the MPC is 0.8, that means that for every extra dollar of income, 80% of it gets spent on consumption and what's left remains saved or isn't consumed.

I think the key here is the multiplier effect. The multiplier tells us how much the total output increases due to an initial increase in spending. The formula for the multiplier is 1 divided by (1 - MPC). So, if MPC is 0.8, then 1 - MPC is 0.2. So 1 / 0.2 equals 5. That means each dollar of spending leads to a five dollar increase in GDP.

Wait, let me make sure. So, if I spend $1, then the total GDP increases by $5 because the initial $1 is multiplied by 5. Yeah, that sounds right. So, each dollar of spending leads to a five dollar increase because it's multiplied by the multiplier.

So, if we spend $500, then the total increase in GDP would be 500 multiplied by 5. Let me calculate that: 500 * 5 is $2,500. Looking at the options, option A is $2,500. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but are there any exceptions or other factors I'm missing? Like, does this apply only to the initial spending? Or is it the total effect? Oh, right, the multiplier effect applies when the initial spending is multiplied by the multiplier each time, creating a chain reaction. So, the first dollar leads to 5 dollars, the second dollar leads to 4 more (since 50% is saved, and the rest is spent), and so on. But in the question, it's asking for the largest total increase, which would be the sum of all these effects, which is a multiplication by the multiplier.

So, yes, the total increase is 500 * 5 = 2500, which is option A.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8, meaning 80% of each additional dollar is spent, leaving 20% as savings. The multiplier effect is calculated as 1 / (1 - MPC) = 5. Thus, an initial $500 spending leads to a total increase in GDP of $500 * 5 = $2,500. The correct answer is A.

Answer: A
