Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the standard deviation of the packed boxes' weights. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on statistics, but I'll give it a shot.

First, let's understand what's given. There are three main components: the books per box, the weight of the boxes, and the packing material per box. Each of these has their own mean and standard deviation.

The problem states:
- The mean weight of books per box is 25 pounds, with a standard deviation of 2 pounds.
- The mean weight of the boxes is 1 pound, with a standard deviation of 0.15 pounds.
- The mean weight of the packing material per box is 2 pounds, with a standard deviation of 0.25 pounds.

We need to find the standard deviation of the packed boxes' weights.

Hmm. So each box contains a certain amount of books, boxes, and packing material. So the total weight of a box is the sum of these three components.

Let me model this. Let's denote:

- B: the weight of the books in a box.
- X: the weight of the box itself.
- P: the weight of the packing material in a box.

So, the total weight W of a box is: W = B + X + P.

We need to find the standard deviation of W.

We know the standard deviations for B, X, and P, but what about their relationships? Are they independent? I think so, unless stated otherwise. So we can treat them as independent variables.

In statistics, when variables are independent, their variances add up. So the variance of the sum is the sum of variances.

Wait, but variance is the square of the standard deviation. So, for each component, we can find their variances, sum them, and the square root will give the standard deviation of W.

Let me write that out.

Variance of B is (2)^2 = 4.
Variance of X is (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.
Variance of P is (0.25)^2 = 0.0625.

So, the variance of W is 4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625.

Let me calculate that: 4 plus 0.085 is 4.085. So the variance is 4.085 pounds squared.

To find the standard deviation (which is the square root of the variance), we take sqrt(4.085).

Hmm, what's sqrt(4.085)? Let me think. I know that sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(4.09) is approximately 2.022 because 2.022 squared is about 4.088. Wait, let me compute it exactly.

Wait, 2.022 squared: 2^2=4, 0.022^2=0.000484, and cross terms 2*(2)*(0.022)=0.088. So total is 4 + 0.088 + 0.000484 ≈ 4.088484. Oh, but our variance is 4.085. So 2.022 squared is 4.088484, which is a bit higher than 4.085.

So, the exact value would be slightly less than 2.022. Let's see:

Let me compute 2.021 squared:

(2.021)^2 = (2 + 0.021)^2 = 2^2 + 2*(2)*(0.021) + (0.021)^2 = 4 + 0.084 + 0.000441 = 4.084441.

So that's 4.084441, which is very close to 4.085.

Wait, our variance is 4.085. So 2.021^2 is 4.084441, which is 0.00056 less than 4.085. So perhaps the square root is a little more than 2.021.

Let me try 2.021 + a small delta, say 2.0215^2.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using linear approximation. Let me denote x = 2.021, and we have f(x) = x^2 = 4.084441.

We need to find a delta (delta x) such that (x + delta x)^2 ≈ 4.085.

So, 4.084441 + 2*2.021*delta x + (delta x)^2 = 4.085.

Assuming delta x is very small, the (delta x)^2 term is negligible. So:

2*2.021 * delta x ≈ 4.085 -4.084441 = 0.000559.

So 4.042 * delta x ≈ 0.000559.

delta x ≈ 0.000559 / 4.042 ≈ approximately 0.000138.

So, x + delta x ≈ 2.021 + 0.000138 ≈ 2.021138.

So the square root of 4.085 is approximately 2.021138 pounds.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H is 2.021 pounds.

But wait, the calculation I did came up with 2.0211, which is approximately 2.0211, which rounds to 2.021, so option H is the correct one.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier calculations. Because the variance is 4.085, and the standard deviation is sqrt(4.085)= approximately 2.021.

Wait, the options are:

A: 28.000

B: 1.950

C: 2.500

D: 4.085

E: 3.012

F: 3.500

G:5.290

H: 2.021

I:2.250

J:1.785

So, option H is 2.021, which matches our calculation. So answer is H.

The standard deviation of the packed box weights is calculated by summing the variances of the individual components (books, box, and packing material) and then taking the square root. The variances are:

- Books: (2)^2 = 4
- Box: (0.15)^2 = 0.0225
- Packing material: (0.25)^2 = 0.0625

Adding these gives a total variance of 4.085. Taking the square root of 4.085 yields approximately 2.021. Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is H: 2.021 pounds.
