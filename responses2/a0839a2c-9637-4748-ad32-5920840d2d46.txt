Okay, so I have this question about bonds and their prices based on different interest rates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says Mr. Golden bought three bonds from SuttonsmithCorporation. Each bond has a face value of $1,000, and he gets $15 every six months for 20 years. That means each bond has a total of 20 years × 2 payments = 40 payments. But wait, the interest rate varies for each bond, so the price of each bond will change based on that rate.

The options are A to J, each giving three prices. My job is to figure out which option is correct.

I remember that the price of a bond is the present value of all future cash flows. For each bond, the cash flows are the semiannual $15 payments plus the $1,000 face value at the end of 20 years. So the formula for the bond price is the sum of the present value of the annuity (the $15 payments) plus the present value of the face value.

The present value of an ordinary annuity can be calculated with the formula:
PV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]
Where PMT is the payment per period, r is the periodic interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

The present value of a single sum is:
PV = FV / (1 + r)^n
Where FV is the face value.

Wait, but since the interest rates vary for each bond, I'll need to calculate each one separately.

Let me look at the interest rates again. There are three bonds with rates 3%, 4%, and 3.6%. So each will have a different present value.

Let me calculate each one step by step.

First, for the bond with 3% interest rate:
- The periodic rate (r) is 3%/2 = 1.5% per period, which is 0.015.
- The number of periods (n) is 40.

So the present value of the $15 annuity is:
PV_annuity = 15 × [(1 - (1 + 0.015)^-40) / 0.015]

I can compute (1 + 0.015)^40. Let me see, 1.015^40. Hmm, I think I can calculate it. Let me approximate or use a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can recall that 1.015^40 is about e^(40 * 0.015) = e^0.6 ≈ 1.8221. But that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can calculate it step by step. Alternatively, I can use the formula.

Wait, maybe I can compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula on a calculator or think of it as:

(1 + r)^n = (1.015)^40. Let's compute this:

I can compute this as:

(1.015)^40:

I remember that (1.015)^20 is approximately 1.3469. Then, (1.015)^40 is (1.3469)^2 ≈ 1.814. So (1.015)^40 ≈ 1.814.

So 1/(1.814) ≈ 0.5513.

So the numerator is (1 - 0.5513) = 0.4487.

Then, 0.4487 / 0.015 ≈ 29.913.

So the annuity present value is 15 × 29.913 ≈ 448.695.

Now, the present value of the face value is 1000 / (1.015)^40.

We have (1.015)^40 ≈ 1.814, so 1000 / 1.814 ≈ 551.31.

So the total bond price is 448.695 + 551.31 ≈ 1,000.005, approximately $1,000.00.

Hmm, wait, but each option's first bond is priced around $950, $1,000, etc. So why is it $1,000? But let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option E says the first bond is $1,000.00. So that's one possibility.

Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because the present value of the 3% bond is $1,000.00? But I thought the present value would be less than face value if the rate is less than the coupon rate. Wait, wait, but 3% is the interest rate on the bond. The coupon rate is $15 / $1,000 per period. So 15/1000 = 1.5% per period, which is the same as the rate here (r). So in this case, the bond is priced at face value, because the coupon rate equals the market rate.

So yes, the price is $1,000. So option E and H have the first bond at $1,000.00.

Wait, options E and H are possible. Let me check the others.

Second bond: 4% interest rate.

So r = 4%/2 = 2% per period (0.02).

n =40.

PV_annuity = 15 × [(1 - (1.02)^-40)/0.02]

Compute (1.02)^40. Let's see, ln(1.02) is approx 0.0198, so 40 * 0.0198 ≈ 0.792, so e^0.792 is about 2.20.

So (1.02)^40 ≈ 2.205.

So 1/(1.02)^40 ≈ 1/2.205 ≈ 0.4535.

So 1 - 0.4535 ≈ 0.5465.

Then 0.5465 / 0.02 = 27.325.

So annuity present value is 15 × 27.325 = 409.875.

Face value present value: 1000 / (1.02)^40 ≈ 1000/2.205≈ 453.49.

Total bond price: 409.875 + 453.49 ≈ 863.365, approximately $863.37.

Looking at the options, option J says the second bond is $863.23, which is close.

Third bond: 3.6% interest rate.

r=3.6/2=1.8%=0.018.

n=40.

PV_annuity = 15 × [(1 - (1.018)^-40)/0.018]

Compute (1.018)^40. Hmm, let's see. ln(1.018) ≈ 0.0178, so 40 * 0.0178 ≈ 0.712. e^0.712 ≈ 2.039.

So (1.018)^40 ≈ 2.039.

So 1/(1.018)^40 ≈ 0.4906.

1 - 0.4906 = 0.5094.

0.5094 / 0.018 ≈ 28.30.

So annuity present value is 15 × 28.30 = 424.5.

Face value present value: 1000 / (1.018)^40 ≈ 1000 / 2.039 ≈ 490.38.

Total bond price: 424.5 + 490.38 ≈ 914.88.

Looking at the options, option E is [1000, 863.23, 914.88], which would be option E.

But wait, looking back, option E's first bond is $1,000.00, second is $863.23, third is $914.88. That's option E.

Wait, but wait a second. So the third bond's price is approximately $914.88, which is around $914.88. But looking at the options, option E's third bond is 914.88, which matches. So option E's first bond is 1000, which we thought earlier. So that's a possible correct option.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check the third bond's options.

Looking at the options, E gives 914.88, which matches. So the third bond is 914.88.

Wait, but the options for the third bond (third bond's prices) are:

Option E: 914.88

Option G: 910.26

Option H: 915.26

Option I: 950.26

So E's third bond is 914.88.

But wait, the third bond's present value I calculated as approximately 914.88, which is option E's third bond.

But wait, earlier I thought that for the 3% bond, the price was $1,000.00. For the 4% bond, it's about $863.37, and for the 3.6% bond, $914.88.

Looking at the options, option E is [1,000.00, 863.23, 914.88]. So that's option E.

But wait, looking back, let me check the second bond.

Wait, the second bond's calculated price is approximately $863.37, which is close to option J's second bond of 863.23. But option J's third bond is 920.26, which is different.

So option E would have the second bond at around 863.37, which is option J's second bond at 863.23. Hmm, but the first bond in E is 1,000.00, which matches our calculation. The third bond is 914.88, which is E's third bond. So that would mean option E is correct.

Wait, but I need to check whether the calculations are correct. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, for the 3% bond:

r=0.015, n=40.

(1.015)^40 = approx 1.814.

(1 - 1/1.814) = (0.822). 0.822 / 0.015 = 54.8. So 15 * 54.8 = 822. So annuity PV is 822.

Face value PV: 1000 / 1.814 ≈ 551.31.

Total: 822 + 551.31 = 1373.31? Wait, no, that's incorrect. Oh wait, no—because 15 × 54.8 is 822. So 822 (annuity) + 551.31 (face) = 1373.31. That can't be right because the bond can't be more than face value. Wait, no, because the 3% rate is equal to the coupon rate (1.5% per period). So the present value of the coupon payments would be less than the face value, but the total should be less than the face value plus the present value of the face. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, I think perhaps I confused the formula. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the formula for the present value of an annuity is (PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ]) / r.

So for the 3% bond:

r=0.015, n=40.

(1 + 0.015)^40 = approximately 1.814, as before.

(1 + 0.015)^-40 = 1 / 1.814 ≈ 0.5513.

So 1 - 0.5513 = 0.4487.

0.4487 / 0.015 ≈ 29.913.

So 15 * 29.913 ≈ 448.695.

Face value: 1000 / 1.015^40 ≈ 1000 / 1.814 ≈ 551.31.

Total price: 448.695 + 551.31 = 1,000.005, approximately $1,000.00. So that's correct.

So the first bond is $1,000.00.

Second bond: 4% rate (r=0.02), n=40.

(1.02)^40 ≈ 2.205.

1/(1.02)^40 = 0.4535.

1 - 0.4535 = 0.5465.

0.5465 / 0.02 = 27.325.

So 15 * 27.325 = 409.875.

Face value: 1000 /1.02^40 = 1000 / 2.205 ≈ 453.49.

Total: 409.875 + 453.49 ≈ 863.365, so ~863.37.

Looking at the options, option J's second bond is $863.23, which is close.

Third bond: 3.6% rate (r=0.018).

(1.018)^40: Let's compute it correctly.

ln(1.018) ≈ 0.0178, so 40*0.0178=0.712. e^0.712 ≈ 2.039, so (1.018)^40 ≈ 2.039.

1/(1.018)^40 = 1/2.039 ≈ 0.4906.

1 - 0.4906 = 0.5094.

0.5094 /0.018 = 28.30.

15 ×28.30 = 424.5.

Face value: 1000/2.039 ≈ 490.38.

Total price: 424.5 + 490.38 ≈ 914.88.

Looking at the options, option E's third bond is 914.88, which matches.

So the correct option is E: 1000.00, 863.23, 914.88.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check them again.

Option E: [1000.00, 863.23, 914.88]

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check another bond. For example, the third bond's rate is 3.6%, so the price is 914.88, which is option E's third bond.

So the correct answer is E.
