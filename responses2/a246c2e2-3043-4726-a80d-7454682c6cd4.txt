Question:

Discuss the establishment of a new species of plant or animalby the theory of isolation.

Options:

A: New species arise when there is a complete genetic overhaul due to a cataclysmic event.
B: New species of animals and plants may arise because some physical separation discontinues the distribution of a species for long periods of time, leading to independent evolution and divergence in their gene pools, ultimately causing two new distinct species to arise.
C: New species develop when an existing species is exposed to radiation or chemical pollutants.
D: New species are formed when individuals of a species adapt to different diets within the same environment.
E: New species evolve when an existing species undergoes a sudden mutation.
F: New species evolve when members of a species travel to space and undergo genetic changes due to cosmic radiation.
G: New species arise due to cross-breeding between existing species.
H: New species emerge exclusively through the process of artificial selection by humans.
I: New species originate when a species' habitat is destroyed, forcing them to adapt to a new habitat or die out.
J: New species are created through human intervention and genetic modification.

Okay, so I have this biology question here about the theory of isolation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which option correctly discusses the establishment of a new species by the theory of isolation. The options are A to J, each giving a different scenario.

First, I remember that the theory of isolation is related to the concept of geographic isolation. I think it has something to do with when species form or change their characteristics. I recall that when species are geographically separated, they can develop their own unique traits independently. That's because there's no gene flow between them, so their genes don't mix. This allows each species to evolve on its own.

Looking at the options:

Option A: New species arise when there's a complete genetic overhaul due to a cataclysmic event. I don't think a cataclysm would cause a complete overhaul. Like a big event, maybe a volcanic eruption? I don't think that's what isolation theory is about. It's more about genetic changes over time, not a sudden big event.

Option B: Physical separation leading to independent evolution. This seems to fit. When species are separated geographically, their genes don't mix, so different environments can lead to new traits. So, this is a possibility.

Option C: Radiation or chemicals. That sounds more like a factor in natural selection, not isolation. These are more about environmental changes that affect existing species, not creating new species because of their own isolation.

Option D: Adaptation to different diets. I don't think this is about isolation. It's more about natural selection within the same species, like different diets leading to different traits but not new species arising from the isolation process itself.

Option E: Sudden mutation. Well, mutations can lead to new traits, but I'm not sure if that's the cause of new species. It's more about the process of evolution happening through mutations, not specific to the theory of isolation.

Option F: Members of a species traveling to space and getting genetic changes. That's more like a natural disaster that affects the species, perhaps causing genetic mutations. But again, it's not the theory of isolation itself.

Option G: Cross-breeding between existing species. Oh, wait, that's another theory called allopolyploidy or maybe hybridization. I remember that crossbreeding can lead to new traits. But isn't that more about how species come together rather than establishing new species?

Option H: Human intervention and genetic modification. That's a specific method, like using CRISPR to change genes. But the question is about the theory of isolation, which I think is more about the genetic changes leading to new species regardless of human intervention.

Option I: Habitat destruction forcing them to adapt. That sounds like isolation, because the environment is changing, forcing the species to change. So this fits with the theory.

Option J: Human intervention and genetic modification. While this can create new species, the theory of isolation itself doesn't specifically mention humans. It's more about the process leading to new species regardless of human intervention.

Wait, back to the theory of isolation. I think the key idea is that when two species are geographically separated, they can develop their own characteristics because there's no gene flow. So the new species arise as a result of this isolation causing their own evolution. So option B says physical separation discontinues distribution, leading to independent evolution. That aligns with that.

Option I says habitat destruction causes them to adapt, which is a form of isolation too, but the question is about the theory of isolation. So both B and I use isolation, but which is the best option?

The question is about the theory of isolation. Wait, what do I know about the theory of isolation? I think it's more about the process where isolation leads to new species. So, for example, if two species are separate, like in the case ofExtansus, their genes don't mix, so they can evolve independently.

So, looking at the options again, option B says that physical separation (like becoming geographically separate) leads to independent evolution in gene pools, leading to distinct species. That sounds right.

Option I says that habitat destruction (like destroying habitats) causes them to adapt, which is another way to cause isolation, but the question is about the theory of isolation. So which of the options correctly states this?

Another point: The theory of isolation is more about the mechanism of how isolation leads to new species. So the proper statement would be about physical separation causing independent evolution.

So the correct answer is option B.

The correct answer is **B: New species of animals and plants may arise because some physical separation discontinues the distribution of a species for long periods of time, leading to independent evolution and divergence in their gene pools, ultimately causing two new distinct species to arise.**

This option aligns with the concept of isolation, where geographical separation causes species to evolve independently due to the lack of gene flow. This mechanism explains how new species can emerge, as seen in scenarios like the separation ofExtansus or the evolution of new plant species due to isolation.
