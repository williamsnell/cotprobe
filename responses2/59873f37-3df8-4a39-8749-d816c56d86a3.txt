Okay, so I have this question about fashion houses that were sued for stealing a design. The question is asking which fashion house is the one that was accused of stealing a design and then sued for damages to its reputation. The options are A through J, each representing a different brand.

First, I need to remember what each of these fashion houses is known for. I think I've heard a bit about each, but I'm not super familiar with all the details. Let me try to recall:

- **Gucci**: I know they're famous for their iconic black and white designs, especially the Handmade series, which is quite distinctive.
- **Chanel**: That's the famous red carpet brand, known for their bold and unique designs, and they have a lot of limited editions.
- **Versace**: I'm not as familiar with, but they might have been accused of stealing something. I think they were involved in a scandal where they had a design stolen, which led to some lawsuits.
- **Prada**: That's known for its大胆, abstract designs and has a history of thefts.
- **Dior**: They are famous for their luxury fashion and have a lot of high-end lines, but I'm not sure if they were involved in such a theft.
- **Dolce & Gabbana**: They have a lot of modern designs, but I'm not sure about any famous cases involving theft.
- **Louis Vuitton**: They're known for their trendy designs, but I don't recall them being accused of stealing.
- **Lacroix**: I'm not sure about this one, but maybe they had a similar issue.
- **Yves Saint Laurent**: They're a big name with a lot of high-end fashion, but again, not sure about the theft issue.
- **Givenchy**: They're known for their elegant, vintage designs, but I don't think they were the first to steal.

The question is about the fashion house that was accused of stealing a design and then sued for damages. So, I'm thinking of the ones that were in the news for design thefts. I remember that Versace was involved in a case where they had a design stolen. I think they were at the center of a scandal where they had to pay lawsuits, which led to the loss of their reputation.

Wait, let me think again. Another possibility is Prada, but I'm not sure if they were the first or if they were involved in a specific case. Alternatively, Dior had a scandal where they were involved in theft, but I'm not certain about whether that led to a lawsuit. Or maybe Yves Saint Laurent? No, I don't think so. 

I'm pretty confident that Versace was the one. They were accused of stealing a design, and that led to lawsuits and the loss of their reputation. So the answer should be C: Versace.

The fashion house that was accused of stealing a design and sued for damages to its reputation is **Versace**.
