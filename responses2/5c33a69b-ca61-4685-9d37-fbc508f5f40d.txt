Okay, so I've got this problem about geometric series and figuring out the largest possible value of k, which is the number of different numbers Bill can pick with the same number of digits. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the nth term of the geometric series is given by a * r^(n-1). Both a and r are positive integers, and r is greater than 1. So, it's a standard geometric sequence with a common ratio r.

Bill is picking k different numbers from this sequence, and all of them must have the same number of digits. I need to find the maximum possible value of k.

Alright, so each term in the sequence is a * r^(n-1). Since a and r are positive integers, each term is an integer as well. The question is about the number of digits each term has. I remember that the number of digits of a number can be found using logarithms. Specifically, the number of digits d of a number x is given by d = floor(log10(x)) + 1.

So, for each term a * r^(n-1), its number of digits is floor(log10(a * r^(n-1))) + 1. Let's denote this as d(n) = floor(log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r)) + 1.

Since a and r are positive integers, log10(a) is the exponent to which 10 must be raised to get a. Similarly, log10(r) is the exponent for r.

I need to find the maximum number of terms in this sequence that have the same number of digits. So, I need to find how many consecutive terms (or near-consecutive terms) have the same d(n).

Let me think about how the number of digits changes as n increases. Each term is multiplied by r, so the number of digits can either stay the same or increase by one, depending on whether the multiplication causes the number to cross a power of 10.

So, if r is 10, then each term is 10 times the previous one, so the number of digits increases by one each time (except when a is 1, in which case it stays 1). But since r is greater than 1, but not necessarily 10, I need to consider general r.

Wait, but a and r can be any positive integers with r>1. So, perhaps I should approach this by considering r as a multiplier and how the number of digits changes for each term.

Let me consider an example to get a better idea. Suppose a is 1 and r is 2. Then the terms are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc. The number of digits each term has: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, etc. So, the number of digits increases only when the term crosses a power of 10.

Similarly, if a is 1 and r is 3, the digits would be 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, etc.

Wait, but more generally, for a general a and r>1, each term is a multiplied by r to the power of (n-1). So, the number of digits of term n is determined by how large a*r^(n-1) is.

I think the key here is to find the maximum number of consecutive terms where the number of digits remains the same. That is, the maximum number of terms in a row where each term has exactly d digits, for some d. The question is, what is the maximum such k possible.

Wait, but the problem says "all of which have the same number of digits." So, it's possible that the number of digits increases, then decreases, but the maximum number in a row is what we're interested in.

But wait, perhaps the maximum number of terms with the same number of digits occurs when r is a power of 10. Because then, each multiplication by r increases the number of digits by one each time. For example, if r = 10, then each term is 10 times the previous, so the number of digits increases by one each time. But in that case, there's no term that has the same number of digits as the previous term. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, no, if a is 1, r is 10, then the terms are 1,10,100,1000, etc. So the number of digits is 1,2,3,4,... which increases by one each time. So, in that case, each term has a unique number of digits, so you can't have more than 1 term with the same number of digits.

But the question must have a maximum k greater than 1. So perhaps r is not 10.

Wait, perhaps r is a number that, when multiplied by a, gives a number that is a power of 10, so that a*r^m is a power of 10, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the multiplicative factor in terms of logs. Let's consider the logarithm (base 10) of each term. So, log10(a*r^(n-1)) = log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r). Each term is then 10 raised to this value, so the number of digits is the floor of this log plus 1.

So, the number of digits of term n is floor(log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r)) + 1.

So, the number of digits increases by 1 each time (or sometimes more, if the fractional part of log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r) is near 1) until it wraps around to the next integer. So, the length of the interval where the number of digits is the same is determined by how much you can increase (n-1)*log10(r) before the fractional part reaches 1.

Wait, but the fractional part of log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r) determines when the number of digits increases.

Wait, more precisely, the fractional part of log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r) determines whether the number of digits increases. If the fractional part is less than 1, then it's less than the next power of 10, so the number of digits increases by 1. If it's ≥1, then it wraps around, and the number of digits remains the same.

So, the maximum number of terms with the same number of digits would occur when the interval between two terms (n and n+k) is such that the fractional parts of log10(a) + (n)*log10(r) and log10(a) + (n+k)*log10(r) are both less than 1 (or both ≥1), thereby allowing the number of digits to stay the same.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the fractional parts of (log10(r) * (n-1)) being in a certain interval.

Wait, maybe another approach: Let me think about the ratio between consecutive terms. The ratio between term n and term n+1 is a*r^{n} / (a*r^{n-1}) ) = r. So, each term is r times the previous.

So, for the number of digits to stay the same, the term must not cross a power of 10. So, the number of digits of term n is d if 10^{d-1} ≤ a*r^{n-1} < 10^d.

So, for a fixed d, we can find n such that 10^{d-1} ≤ a*r^{n-1} < 10^d. Taking log base 10: log10(10^{d-1}) ≤ log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r) < log10(10^d). So:

d-1 ≤ log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r) < d.

Which can be rewritten as:

(n-1)*log10(r) ≥ d - 1 - log10(a)

and

(n-1)*log10(r) < d - log10(a).

So, solving for (n-1):

(n-1) ≥ [(d - 1) - log10(a)] / log10(r)

and

(n-1) < [ (d - log10(a)) ] / log10(r).

Since n must be an integer, the number of valid n's is the number of integers in the interval [ (d -1 - log10(a))/log10(r) + 1, (d - log10(a))/log10(r) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute this differently.

Let me denote x_n = log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r).

We need to find the maximum number of consecutive n's such that x_n is in [d-1, d) for some integer d.

Each time x_n crosses d, the number of digits increases by 1.

So, the maximum number of n's in a row where x_n remains in [d-1, d) is the maximum number of consecutive terms that have the same number of digits.

Wait, but the number of digits can't stay the same for more than one step unless x_n is in a region where adding another term doesn't cross the next power of 10.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this.

Let me let’s suppose that the number of digits remains the same for k terms. That would mean that for n, n+1, ..., n+k, each x_n = log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r) is in [d-1, d) for the same d.

So, for each term in this k-term sequence, log10(a) + (n+i-1)*log10(r) ≥ d-1 and <d, for i from 0 to k-1.

So, (n+i-1)*log10(r) ≥ (d-1) - log10(a)

and

(n+i-1)*log10(r) < d - log10(a).

Subtracting the first inequality from the second, we get:

0 ≤ (n+i)*log10(r) - (n+i-1)*log10(r) < (d - log10(a)) - (d-1 - log10(a)) )

Which simplifies to 0 < 1. Hmm, that's always true. So, perhaps a better approach is to find the maximum k such that for i=0 to i=k-1, the x_n in those terms are all in [d-1, d).

So, the lower bound for x_n is d-1, and the upper bound is d.

So:

x_n = log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r) ≥ d -1

and

x_n = log10(a) + (n-1)*log10(r) < d.

So, solving for n:

x_n ≥ d -1 → (n-1)*log10(r) ≥ (d-1) - log10(a)

→ (n-1) ≥ [ (d-1) - log10(a) ] / log10(r)

Similarly,

x_n < d → (n-1)*log10(r) < (d) - log10(a)

→ (n-1) < [ (d) - log10(a) ] / log10(r)

So, n-1 must lie in the interval [A, B), where A = [ (d-1 - log10(a) ) / log10(r) ], and B = [ (d - log10(a)) / log10(r) ]

But since n is an integer, the number of valid n's (i.e., the number of terms in the k-term sequence) is the number of integers in [A+1, B), because n starts at 1. Wait, perhaps I should adjust the indices.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the terms n, n+1, ..., n+k-1, so the n's are n, n+1, ..., n+k-1.

Thus, for each term in this sequence, the x_n is in [d-1, d).

So, for each i from 0 to k-1,

x_{n+i} = log10(a) + (n+i -1)*log10(r) ≥ d-1

and

x_{n+i} < d.

Which can be rewritten as:

(n+i -1)*log10(r) ≥ (d-1) - log10(a)

and

(n+i -1)*log10(r) < (d) - log10(a)

Dividing all terms by log10(r):

n+i -1 ≥ [ (d-1) - log10(a) ] / log10(r)

and

n+i -1 < [ (d) - log10(a) ] / log10(r)

So, the lower bound is (n+i-1) ≥ (d-1 - log10(a)) / log10(r)

The upper bound is (n+i-1) < (d - log10(a)) / log10(r)

So, for each i from 0 to k-1, (n+i-1) must lie in this interval.

But each i adds 1 to the lower bound? Because i increments by 1 each time.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think about the maximum possible k.

Let me consider the fractional part of log10(a) and log10(r). Let me denote:

Let’s let’s denote α = log10(a) and β = log10(r). So, each term's fractional part is (α + (n-1)β) mod 1.

The number of digits remains the same when the fractional part is less than 1, because that means the term hasn't surpassed the next power of 10.

So, for the number of digits to stay the same for k consecutive terms, the fractional parts of α + (n-1)β, α + nβ, ..., α + (n+k-1)β must all be less than 1.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each term is a*r^{n-1}, so each term's fractional part is (log10(a) + (n-1)log10(r)) mod 1.

So, for each term in the sequence, the fractional part of the exponent is (d-1) ≤ α + (n-1)β < d.

Wait, but the fractional part of (d-1) is 0, and the fractional part of d is 0, so the fractional part of (α + (n-1)β) must be between 0 and 1.

So, to get the maximum number of consecutive terms where the fractional part is less than 1, we can model this as the maximum number of consecutive terms where the fractional part of (α + (n-1)β) is less than 1.

Wait, but the fractional parts of (α + (n-1)β) could be in the same interval.

This seems similar to the concept of equidistribution modulo 1, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, let's think of the fractional parts of (α + kβ) for k = 0,1,2,...,m.

Each time the fractional part increases by β modulo 1. Since β is log10(r), which is a positive real number.

If β is rational, say β = p/q, then the fractional parts will cycle through a periodic sequence. The maximum number of consecutive terms with fractional parts less than 1 would be determined by how often the fractional parts cross the 1 boundary.

But since a and r are arbitrary, perhaps it's better to find the maximum possible k for any a and r.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum k is 10, because the number of digits can be up to 10 in base 10, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the maximum number of terms with the same number of digits is 10. Because, suppose a=1 and r=10. Then, the terms are 1,10,100,1000,... Each term's number of digits increases by 1 each time. So, only one term has two digits, no two terms have the same number. So, in this case, k=1.

But perhaps when r is a number whose log10(r) is such that each multiplication by r doesn't cross the next power of 10 too quickly.

Wait, let's consider r=100. Then, each term is a multiplied by 100^{n-1}, so each term is 100^{n-1} times a. So, if a=1, the terms are 1, 100, 10000, etc. The number of digits increases by 2 each time. So, no two terms have the same number of digits.

Hmm, that's worse. So, perhaps I should choose r such that each multiplication by r doesn't cause the number of digits to increase too quickly.

Wait, perhaps r should be such that when multiplied by a, each term is a power of 10, so that each term has the same number of digits as the next. But that's not possible because r is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider a=1 and r=1000, so each term is multiplied by 1000, so the number of digits increases by 3 each time. Not helpful for maximizing k.

Wait, perhaps I should consider a=1 and r=99. Then, the terms are 1, 99, 99^2, etc. Each term is one less than a power of 100, so the number of digits is 3 for 99^2 (since 99^2=9801), which has 4 digits. Wait, 99^1=99 → 2 digits. 99^2=9801 → 4 digits. So, the number of digits increases by 2 each time. So, no two terms have the same number of digits. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps choosing a and r such that each term is just below a power of 10, so that each term has the same number of digits. But that requires that each multiplication by r doesn't cross a power of 10, which could be possible if r is a number like 1.000...1, but with r being integer, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the fractional parts of α and β. Let me take α = log10(a) and β = log10(r). Then, the fractional parts of α + (n-1)β must all be less than 1 for the number of digits to remain the same.

So, the maximum number of consecutive terms would be determined by how many times adding β to the fractional part doesn't reach 1.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum number of consecutive terms is 10, because with r=100, for example, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the maximum number of consecutive terms where the fractional part (α + (n-1)β) doesn't cross 1. So, the number of terms where the fractional part is less than 1 is as large as possible.

The maximum possible k is determined by the number of times you can add β without crossing 1.

So, the maximum k is the maximum number of consecutive terms where the fractional part remains in [0,1). Since β is a positive real number, the number of consecutive terms where the fractional part is in [0,1) can be as large as possible.

But wait, if β is irrational, the fractional parts would be dense in [0,1), so the maximum number of consecutive terms could be any number, but that's not the case here because a and r are integers.

Wait, but a and r are given as positive integers, so β = log10(r) is a rational number only if r is a power of 10. Because for example, r=10^k, then log10(r) = k.

Wait, so if r is a power of 10, say r=10^k, then log10(r)=k, which is an integer. So, in that case, β is an integer.

So, in that case, each term's x_n is α + (n-1)*k.

So, the fractional part of x_n is equal to the fractional part of α, since k is an integer. So, if α has a fractional part, then all x_n will have the same fractional part. Thus, the number of digits will be determined by the integer part of x_n.

So, the number of digits will be ceil(x_n) if x_n is not an integer. Wait, perhaps x_n is an integer when n is such that (n-1)*k is integer. But since k is an integer, (n-1)*k is always integer. So, x_n is α + integer.

Thus, the number of digits is floor(x_n) + 1.

So, the number of digits would be floor(α + (n-1)*k) +1.

Which is equal to floor(α) + (n-1)*k +1.

Since floor(α) is the integer part of α.

So, the number of digits increases by 1 for each additional term, because each term is multiplied by r=10^k, which is a power of 10, so each term is 10^k times the previous, which increases the number of digits by k each time.

Wait, but then each term's number of digits increases, so you can't have more than one term with the same number of digits.

But the problem says "Bill picked a, and then r was picked," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps r is not a power of 10, but a number that when multiplied by a, gives a number that is a power of 10, so that each term has the same number of digits as the next term.

Wait, for example, a=2, r=5. Then, the terms are 2, 10, 50, 250, etc. The number of digits increases by 1 each time. So, only one term has two digits, no two terms have the same number of digits.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the maximum k is 9, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the maximum number of consecutive terms where the fractional part of α + (n-1)β is less than 1, given that β = log10(r).

If β is irrational, then the sequence (α + (n-1)β) mod 1 is dense in [0,1), so the number of terms with fractional part less than 1 can be as large as possible. But since a and r are integers, β must be rational.

Wait, if β is rational, say β = p/q, then the fractional parts cycle with period q. So, the maximum number of consecutive terms with fractional parts less than 1 is q.

Wait, for example, if β = 1/3, then the fractional parts cycle through 0, 1/3, 2/3, 0, 1/3, etc. So, in each cycle, the number of terms with fractional parts less than 1 is 2 (since 2/3 is less than 1, but 0 is equal). So, in each cycle, there are 2 terms where the fractional part is less than 1.

So, if β is such that the period q is 10, then perhaps the maximum k is 10.

Wait, but in that case, each cycle would have 10 terms, and in each cycle, 9 terms have fractional parts less than 1. So, k would be 9.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the maximum number of consecutive terms with fractional parts less than 1 is q, the denominator.

Wait, for β = p/q, the fractional parts are {0, p/q, 2p/q, ..., (q-1)p/q}.

So, each time, the fractional parts cycle through 0, p/q, 2p/q, etc., up to (q-1)p/q.

So, the number of times the fractional part is less than 1 is q.

But wait, the fractional part 0 is equal to 0, which is less than 1. So, the first term in the cycle has fractional part 0, which is less than 1. The next terms have fractional parts up to (q-1)p/q, which is less than 1 only if (q-1)p/q < 1.

So, when is this true?

(q-1)p/q < 1 → (q-1)p < q → q-1 < q/p.

Since p and q are positive integers, this is only possible when p > (q-1)/q, which is always true because p is at least 1, and (q-1)/q is less than 1.

Wait, but that would mean that for each q, the fractional parts cycle through 0, p/q, 2p/q, etc., and all of those are less than 1 except for when (q-1)p/q is >=1.

Wait, but (q-1)p/q = p - p/q.

So, (q-1)p/q >= 1 → p - p/q >=1 → p(1 - 1/q) >=1 → p >= 1/(1 - 1/q) = q/(q-1).

Since p is an integer, p >= q/(q-1).

But q/(q-1) = 1 + 1/(q-1), which is approximately 1. So, for p >= 1. So, for p=1, q/(q-1)=q/(q-1)= (q-1 +1)/ (q-1) = 1 + 1/(q-1). So, for p=1, q/(q-1) = 1. So, p >=1 is always true.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take an example where β is 1/3, so p=1, q=3.

So, the fractional parts cycle through 0, 1/3, 2/3, 0, 1/3, etc.

So, in each cycle of 3 terms, the fractional parts are 0, 1/3, 2/3.

So, in each cycle, the number of terms with fractional parts less than 1 is 3 (since all are less than 1 except when the fractional part is >=1). Wait, 0 is less than 1, 1/3 is less than 1, 2/3 is less than 1. So, all three terms have fractional parts less than 1. So, in each cycle, all three terms have the same number of digits.

Wait, but each term is a*r^{n-1}, so for β=1/3, each term is a*(r)^(n-1). So, if r=1000, then a*(1000)^(n-1) is a number with n-1 zeros after a, so the number of digits is 4 for n=1, 5 for n=2, etc. Wait, but 1000^1 is 1000, which has 4 digits. 1000^2 is 1000000, which has 7 digits. Wait, but 1000^1 is a, which is 1 digit, but 1000^2 is 1000000, which is 7 digits, so the number of digits increases by 3 each time.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me take a=1, r=1000. Then, the terms are 1, 1000, 1000000, etc. The number of digits is 1, 4, 7, etc. So, no two terms have the same number of digits. So, in this case, k=1.

But in the earlier example, when β=1/3, and a=1, the terms are 1, 1000, 1000000, etc. So, the number of digits is 1, 4, 7, etc. So, no two terms have the same number of digits.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try with a=1, r=10^3. So, a=1, r=1000.

Term 1: 1 → 1 digit.

Term 2: 1*1000 = 1000 → 4 digits.

Term 3: 1000*1000 = 1,000,000 → 7 digits.

So, each term's number of digits increases by 3 each time. So, no two terms have the same number of digits.

Hmm, perhaps I should choose a different a and r.

Wait, let me take a=10, r=10. So, each term is 10, 100, 1000, etc. The number of digits is 2 for the second term, 3 for the third, etc. So, no two terms have the same number of digits.

Wait, another example: a=100, r=10.

Term 1: 100 → 3 digits.

Term 2: 1000 → 4 digits.

Term 3: 10,000 → 5 digits.

Again, each term's number of digits increases by 1 each time, so no two terms have the same number of digits.

Wait, perhaps I should choose a=100 and r=99. Then, the terms are 100, 9900, 980100, etc. The number of digits would be:

Term 1: 100 → 3 digits.

Term 2: 9900 → 4 digits.

Term 3: 980100 → 6 digits.

So, the number of digits increases by 1 each time, so again, no two terms have the same number of digits.

Wait, perhaps I should choose a=100 and r=99. Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should choose a=1 and r=10^k, so each term is 1, 10^k, 10^{2k}, etc. So, the number of digits for term n is k*(n-1) +1.

So, term 1: 1 → 1 digit.

Term 2: 10^k → k+1 digits.

Term 3: 10^{2k} → 2k+1 digits.

So, the number of digits increases by k each time.

So, the number of digits in term n is (n-1)*k +1.

So, when is (n-1)*k +1 equal to (n-2)*k +1?

No, wait, the number of digits increases by k each time, so term n has k*(n-1)+1 digits, and term n+1 has k*n +1 digits. So, they can't have the same number of digits unless k=0, which isn't allowed.

So, in this case, k=10, then term n has 10*(n-1)+1 digits, and term n+1 has 10*n +1 digits, which are different.

So, perhaps the maximum k is 10.

Wait, but when a=1 and r=100, then each term is 1, 100, 10,000, etc. The number of digits increases by 2 each time. So, term 1 has 1 digit, term 2 has 3 digits, term 3 has 5 digits, etc. So, no two terms have the same number of digits.

Wait, but perhaps if a=1 and r=99, then each term is 1, 99, 9801, 970209, etc. The number of digits for term n is:

n=1: 1 → 1 digit.

n=2: 99 → 2 digits.

n=3: 9801 → 4 digits.

n=4: 970209 → 6 digits.

So, the number of digits is 1, 2, 4, 6, etc. So, again, each term's number of digits increases by 1, 2, etc., so no two terms have the same number of digits.

Hmm, perhaps I should choose a and r such that each multiplication by r doesn't change the number of digits. For example, if a=1 and r=100, then each term is 1, 100, 10,000, etc., with number of digits 1, 3, 5, etc. So, no two terms have the same number of digits.

Wait, perhaps the maximum k is 1, because it's impossible to have more than one term with the same number of digits when a and r are positive integers.

Wait, but that can't be, because in the case where a=1 and r=100, we have the number of digits increasing by 3 each time, but no two terms have the same number of digits.

But perhaps when a=1 and r=10, the number of digits increases by 1 each time, so each term's number of digits is unique.

Wait, so perhaps the maximum k is 10, as in the case where a=1 and r=10^k, and each term's number of digits increases by k each time.

Wait, but in that case, each term's number of digits is unique, so k=1, because all terms have unique numbers of digits. So, perhaps the maximum k is 10.

Wait, perhaps I should consider a=1 and r=10^k, so the number of digits in term n is k*(n-1) +1. So, for k=10, the number of digits is 10*(n-1) +1.

So, for n=1: 10*(0)+1=1.

n=2: 10*(1)+1=11.

n=3: 10*2 +1=21.

n=4: 21.

Wait, wait, no, 10*(n-1) +1 is 10*(2-1)+1=11 for n=2, 10*(3-1)+1=21 for n=3, 10*(4-1)+1=31 for n=4, etc.

So, each term's number of digits is unique. So, in this case, k=10.

Wait, but in this case, the number of digits increases by 10 each time, but no two terms have the same number of digits. So, perhaps the maximum k is 10.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's not specified whether r is 10 or something else, but perhaps the maximum k is 10.

So, putting it all together, the maximum possible k is 10, achieved when a=1 and r=10^k, for k=10.

So, the answer is 10.

The largest possible value of \( k \) is 10.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of terms \( k \) such that the number of digits remains constant in a geometric sequence.

2. **Geometric Sequence Insight:**
   - For a geometric sequence \( a, ar, ar^2, \ldots \), the number of digits changes based on the multiplication factor \( r \).

3. **Digit Count Analysis:**
   - Each term's digit count depends on the value of \( r \).
   - Choosing \( a = 1 \) simplifies the analysis, as the term becomes \( 1, r, r^2, \ldots \).

4. **Choosing \( r = 10^k \):**
   - Selecting \( r = 10^k \) ensures that each term's value increases exponentially.
   - The number of digits for term \( n \) is given by \( \text{floor}(n \cdot k) + 1 \).

5. **Maximizing \( k \):**
   - To maximize \( k \), set \( r = 10^{10} \).
   - The number of digits for term \( n \) becomes \( 10(n-1) + 1 \).

6. **Digit Uniqueness:**
   - Each term's digit count is unique, as the digit count increases by 10 each time.
   - This ensures that no two terms have the same number of digits.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible value of \( k \) is 10.

**Answer:**
The largest possible value of \( k \) is \boxed{10}.
