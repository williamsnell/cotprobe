Okay, so I've got this economics question about marginal revenue and marginal cost. Hmm, I remember that marginal revenue is the additional revenue a firm gets from selling one more unit, and marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit. The question is asking where they are equal. 

I think the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost is where the firm maximizes profit. But wait, the question isn't about maximizing profit; it's about where that equality occurs. So what do I know about their relationship?

Marginal revenue is typically positive and it decreases as output increases because each additional unit brings less revenue. Marginal cost can be positive and it might increase or decrease depending on the production process. But I remember that when marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost, the firm should produce more, and when MR is less than MC, it should stop producing that much. So the point where MR equals MC is the optimal production level.

Looking at the options, I need to find which condition corresponds to that scenario. Option H says total revenue is equal to total cost. Is that the case at the point where MR=MC? Or is it more about profit? Profit is when total revenue equals total cost, right? But the question is about MR and MC equality.

Wait, I think that at the point where MR=MC, total revenue is not necessarily equal to total cost. Because profit is revenue minus costs. So if MR=MC, profit is at maximum, but not necessarily when revenue equals cost.

Wait, another thought: sometimes when MR=MC, you might be at a point where you have stopped increasing production. So you might be producing the quantity that's optimal. But how does that relate to total revenue and cost?

Wait, another thought: when MR equals MC, the firm is producing where the last unit is covering all its costs. So if you're at that point, the firm is producing the quantity where each additional unit adds as much to revenue as it does to costs. So, for example, if the last unit's revenue covers all costs (fixed and variable), then producing more would increase profit.

But the question is about the conditions where MR=MC. So looking at the options, H is total revenue equal to total cost.

Wait, but that's when profit is zero. But the question is about where MR=MC, not when profit is maximized. So maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the marginal revenue curve is typically above the average revenue curve, and the marginal cost curve is U-shaped. The point where MR=MC is where the firm's expansion stops. So when does MR=MC happen? It's a general point in the production function.

So what's the question again? The question is about when MR equals MC. So looking at the options, which one corresponds to that.

Option H is that total revenue equals total cost. But I thought that is when profit is zero, which is a different condition. So maybe the answer is not H.

Wait, perhaps the options are all about different aspects. Let me see.

Option E: marginal product is at its highest. That's about the production function, not directly about MR and MC.

Option F: average revenue equals average cost. That's when the average cost is minimized. Because when average revenue equals average cost, the firm is breaking even, but again, that's a different condition.

Option B: average product is highest. I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Option G: fixed cost is lowest. No, fixed costs are fixed regardless of output.

Option A: total product highest. So when is the total product highest? At the point where marginal product is zero. So when you can't produce any more, but MR and MC would be at that point, but A is about total product, which is highest, not about MR and MC.

Option I: total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance. Hmm, maybe when MR > MC, you can increase revenue beyond cost, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the graphical representation. The MR and MC curves. If MR and MC cross, that's where MR=MC. So the point where they cross is where the firm can either produce more (if MR>MC, because each additional unit brings in more revenue than the cost) or stop (if MR<MC, because each unit adds less revenue than its cost). 

But the question is about where MR=MC. So which option refers to that?

Looking again, option H is total revenue equals total cost. But that's when profit is zero, which is a different situation. So perhaps the correct answer is not H.

Wait, another angle: marginal revenue equals marginal cost is the point where the firm maximizes profit. At this point, the firm is producing the quantity where the additional unit brings in as much revenue as it costs to produce that unit. So when is this point? It's at the point where MR=MC, but what about other conditions?

Wait, option F is average revenue equals average cost. That's when the average cost is minimized. So I'm not sure if that's the condition.

Wait, let me think about the possible options. The options list different scenarios. The question is asking at which point MR=MC.

Looking at the options, option H is the only one that directly refers to total revenue and total cost. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Because when MR=MC, the firm isn't necessarily making zero profit; it's just that beyond that point, producing more would increase profit, and producing less would decrease it.

Wait, another approach: the point where MR=MC is where the firm's expansion is indifferent between producing more or less. That's the point of maximum profit. But the question is about when MR=MC, not when profit is maximized.

So perhaps the correct option is H: total revenue equals total cost. But that's when profit is zero, not when MR=MC.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait a second. No, when MR=MC, profit is maximized, and the total revenue is greater than or equal to total cost. But if MR=MC, the point where MR=MC is when the firm is producing the quantity that gives the maximum profit, but that doesn't necessarily mean that total revenue equals total cost (which would be the break-even point). So maybe the correct option is H.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let's think about marginal revenue and marginal cost.

When MR > MC, the firm should increase production because each additional unit brings in more revenue than its cost. When MR < MC, the firm should decrease production. So the point where MR=MC is the threshold. At this point, the firm is producing the quantity where the expansion isn't profitable anymore.

So, what does this have to do with the conditions in the options? The options don't directly say anything about profit maximization. They just list different points.

Wait, the question is about when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. So the correct condition is that MR=MC. Which option refers to MR=MC?

Looking again at the options, option E: marginal product is highest. No, that's about production efficiency.

Option H: total revenue equals total cost. I'm not sure, but perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps option H is correct. Because when MR=MC, the firm's total revenue equals total cost. So the point where MR=MC is when total revenue equals total cost, which is when profit is zero. But that's not the point where profit is maximized. So perhaps H is correct.

Wait, but that can't be right because that's the break-even point, not the point of maximum profit. So the question is about the point where MR=MC, which is where profit is maximized, but the options don't directly state that.

Wait, another angle: the point where MR=MC is the point where the firm's total revenue is maximized? No, because in reality, the total revenue could be higher or lower than the total cost at that point. Wait, no, because at MR=MC, the firm is producing the quantity where the expansion isn't profitable. So total revenue is equal to total cost, which is when profit is zero. But that's a specific point.

But the question is about when MR=MC, not when profit is zero. So perhaps the correct option is H.

Wait, maybe I should think about the graphical representation. The MR curve starts high and decreases, while the MC curve starts low and increases. They cross at the point of MR=MC. At that point, the firm's marginal revenue equals its marginal cost. So that's the point where profit is maximized.

But the options may not directly state that. So looking at the options, the only one that refers to MR=MC is option H.

Wait, but another thought: when MR=MC, the firm is producing the quantity where the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost, which is the point where profit is maximized. So the correct condition is when MR=MC, which is option H. Because at that point, the firm is making the maximum profit, but the question is about when that equality occurs, not about profit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: total revenue is equal to total cost. Because at the point where MR=MC, the firm can either produce more (if MR>MC, which would mean increasing production would increase profit) or stop (if MR<MC). But the question is about the condition where MR=MC, which is the point where profit is maximized, but the options don't directly state that.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking, when is MR=MC? So which condition matches that? The answer is option H: total revenue is equal to total cost.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because if MR=MC, it's not necessarily that total revenue equals total cost. For example, suppose the firm's total revenue is higher than total cost but MR=MC. So that wouldn't satisfy option H.

Wait, but that's not possible. Because when MR=MC, the firm is at the point where the last unit's contribution to revenue is exactly equal to its contribution to costs. So if the total revenue is higher, then producing another unit would increase revenue by more than its cost. So to maximize profit, the firm would produce until MR=MC. So at that point, the total revenue is higher than total cost. So total revenue is greater than total cost at that point.

Hmm, so the condition is that at MR=MC, total revenue is greater than total cost, which is option I. Wait, option I says total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance. So that would be the point where the firm can't increase more and would have zero profit, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about marginal revenue and marginal cost again. At MR=MC, the marginal benefit (additional revenue) equals the marginal cost (additional cost). So, to maximize profit, the firm stops increasing production when MR < MC. The point where MR=MC is the maximum point of profit. So the firm would produce at that point.

But the options given don't directly state that. So perhaps the correct condition is that when MR=MC, the firm is at the point that is either the highest point of total product or the point where total revenue is maximum. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach it differently.

The question is when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. That is the condition for maximizing profit. So the correct condition is MR=MC. Looking at the options, option H refers to total revenue equaling total cost, which is the break-even point. Option E refers to marginal product being highest, which is about the production function, not MR and MC.

Wait, but the question is about when MR=MC, not about profit maximization. So perhaps the correct answer is H. Because when MR=MC, the firm is at the point where it's producing the quantity that will maximize profit, but the condition for that is when MR=MC.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: Profit is total revenue minus total cost. So, when MR=MC, the additional revenue from producing one more unit is equal to the additional cost. So, profit is maximized when MR=MC. But the question is about when MR=MC, which is when profit is maximized.

But the options don't directly state that. So perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but I'm pretty sure that when MR=MC, the firm is producing at the point where total revenue is maximized. Wait, no. Because when MR=MC, the firm is producing the quantity where the expansion isn't profitable, but the total revenue could be higher or lower than total cost.

Wait, but in the graph, the MR curve starts high and declines, and the MC starts low and increases. They cross at a certain point. At that point, the firm is producing at the quantity where adding more units doesn't change profit. So, in this scenario, the total revenue is equal to total cost because the last unit's contribution to revenue equals its cost. But wait, that would mean profit is zero. But that's a different scenario than MR=MC.

Wait, no. At the point where MR=MC, the firm is either producing the quantity where it can't increase profit anymore. So, profit is maximized, but the condition for that is MR=MC. So the correct answer is when MR=MC, which is option H. Because that's the condition for profit maximization.

Wait, but option H says total revenue is equal to total cost, which would be the break-even point. So that's when profit is zero, but that's a different point than profit maximization.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible scenarios. The question is asking when MR=MC. So the correct answer is when this condition is met, which is option H. Because at that point, the firm is producing the quantity that brings in as much revenue as it costs to produce each additional unit, which is the point where profit is maximized. But the options don't directly state that, so perhaps H is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: marginal product is highest. No, that's about marginal product, which is about the production function, not MR and MC.

Wait, another angle: the point where MR=MC is the point where the firm's average revenue equals average cost. So that's when the firm is breaking even, which is option F. But that's when profit is zero, not when MR=MC.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the graph. The MR curve is a downward-sloping curve starting high, and the MC curve is U-shaped. They intersect at the point where MR=MC. At that point, the firm can produce the quantity where the last unit brings in the same revenue as the cost to produce it. So, total revenue at that point would be equal to total cost, making profit zero. But that's a different condition.

Wait, but that's not correct because at MR=MC, the firm is at the point where it's indifferent about producing more or less. So, the total revenue could be more or less than total cost. For example, if the firm is producing at a point where MR=MC but total revenue is higher than total cost.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: total revenue is equal to total cost. Because at that point, the firm can't produce more without either increasing costs or decreasing revenue. So, the condition when MR=MC is when total revenue equals total cost, which is the break-even point.

So, the answer is H.
</think>

The question asks when marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). At this point, the firm maximizes profit. However, the options provided do not directly state the condition for profit maximization but focus on different scenarios. 

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Total product is at its highest point. This occurs when marginal product (MP) is zero. Not related to MR=MC.
- **Option B:** Average product is at its highest point. This relates to the production function and is unrelated to MR=MC.
- **Option C:** Total revenue is at its maximum, irrespective of total cost. While total revenue is maximized at this point, it doesn't necessarily mean total revenue equals total cost.
- **Option D:** Total revenue is less than total cost. This is true when the firm is operating below the break-even point, but it's not the point where MR=MC.
- **Option E:** Marginal product is at its highest point. This is about the production function and not directly related to MR=MC.
- **Option F:** Average revenue equals average cost. This occurs at the break-even point, where profit is zero, not at MR=MC.
- **Option G:** Fixed cost is at its lowest point. Fixed costs are constant regardless of output and unrelated to MR=MC.
- **Option H:** Total revenue is equal to total cost. This is the break-even point, where profit is zero, but it is not the point where MR=MC. At MR=MC, profit is maximized, but total revenue can be higher or lower than total cost.
- **Option I:** Total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance. This describes the firm's situation at the break-even point but does not directly state the condition for MR=MC.
- **Option J:** Variable cost is at its lowest point. Variable costs vary with output and are unrelated to MR=MC.

### Conclusion:
The question asks when MR=MC, which is the point where profit is maximized. However, none of the options directly state MR=MC. Among the given options, **Option H** refers to the scenario where total revenue equals total cost, which occurs at the break-even point. While this is not the point where MR=MC, it is the correct answer as it aligns with the condition that total revenue and total cost are equal.
