Question:

A woman was married to a very wealthy man who had a generous life insurance policy. Deciding that she had had enough of married life, and desiring to spend more time with her boyfriend, she began to plan an early and unexpected demise for her husband. The woman devised a scheme whereby she would contaminate her husband's guacamole with a poisonous substance called strychnine. To facilitate her plan, she enlisted the help of her boyfriend. At first, the boyfriend adamantly refused to go along with her scheme, but when the woman threatened to break off their relationship, he reluctantly agreed. The boyfriend, a pre-med student, got the strychnine from the pharmacy by telling them that he was using it for an experiment with rats. The boyfriend then gave the strychnine to the woman, who sprinkled it in her husband's guacamole. The husband died from the poisoning. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: "Any intentional and premeditated killing or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. " Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction. There are no separate felonies relating to adulterating food or poisoning.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, so the scenario is a woman who married a wealthy man with a generous life insurance policy. She decided to end her married life and spend more time with her boyfriend. To do that, she contaminate his guacamole with strychnine. The boyfriend helped her, but initially, he didn't want to go along because the woman threatened to break off their relationship. When she threatened to break up, he agreed reluctantly. The boyfriend, a pre-med student, got the strychnine from a pharmacy, told them he was using it for an experiment with rats. Then he gave it to the woman, sprinkling it in his husband's guacamole. His husband died from the poisoning.

The statute says that any intentional killing or one caused during the perpetration of a felony is first-degree murder. Murder is second-degree if intent is to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. Assault with intent to kill or cause serious physical injury is a felony.

Also, there's no separate felony for adultery or poisoning. The most serious crime for which the boyfriend can be convicted is one of the options from A to J.

So, what's the key here? The woman used strychnine, which I think is a poison. Strychnine is a known controlled substance used in experiments, and it's known to be toxic, especially in cooking. The boyfriend helped her contaminate her husband's food.

Now, the question is about the crime the boyfriend could be convicted of. Let's break down what happened.

First, the woman contaminate her husband's food with strychnine, which is a poison. She did this with the knowledge that it was a dangerous substance and that she was doing it for a specific reasonâ€”she wanted to end her marriage and spend time with her boyfriend. So, it's a plan involving knowledge of the danger, which is a defense in murder. But wait, in terms of criminal liability, if the act is done with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm, that's murder.

The boyfriend helped her. So, he was aiding her in the plan. But he might not be directly responsible for the death, because he was given the strychnine by the pharmacy, which he had to give to her. So, the strychnine is the key here.

Since he knew of the poison and was able to give it to her, he's acting in his capacity as an ingredient. I remember that when a person acts to provide a substance that leads to death, that's considered the act of supplying the substance. The law is about whether the person was in the course of their duties or was acting in a way that was a felony.

In this case, the boyfriend was helping the woman, who was using the poison. He was able to give the strychnine to her husband, who then died. The question is if he was acting in a way that was a felony. 

The options include first-degree murder, second-degree murder, assault, accessory to murder, etc. But wait, the options don't include ' supplying a controlled substance' as a separate felony. However, some statutes may treat supplying the substance as part of the felony of providing a controlled substance. 

In the scenario, he was a premed student, so he had prior knowledge. He knew about strychnine and was acting in his role as a helper. He also obtained it from a pharmacy. 

So, does that make him a felony? Well, the options given don't have "supplying with knowledge of the substance." Let me think about the possible options.

The options are A: first-degree murder. B: possession. C: second-degree murder. D: assault. E: manslaughter. F: conspiracy. G: accessory. H: attempted. I: aiding. J: no crime.

Wait, the question says 'the most serious crime for which the boyfriend can be properly convicted'. So, the options are A to J, but the question is about the crime he can be convicted of.

So, the key is whether he's guilty of murder, which could be first or second degree, or perhaps another felony.

Strychnine is a controlled substance, and supplying it is a felony in some jurisdictions. But the options don't have that. Let me check the options. The options are separate, so the possible choices are A to J.

In the options, B is " possession of a deadly substance". Possession might be a separate offense, but some statutes treat supplying as part of it. But in the options, B is listed, and I think that's a separate felony. 

Alternatively, the options don't have the first-degree murder in this case because he wasn't killing, but was providing a substance. So first-degree murder requires intent to kill, which he didn't have. He didn't intend to kill, but he intended to cause death through the poison. So, he might be guilty of second-degree murder because he intended to cause serious bodily harm. 

Wait, second-degree murder is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. The husband died from poisoning. He intended to cause serious bodily harm, so he's guilty of second-degree murder. But the options include C: second-degree murder.

Alternatively, could he be guilty of first-degree murder? No, because he didn't intend to kill. So, the options would be either C or possibly another option.

Wait, let me think again. Possession of a deadly substance is a separate offense, but some jurisdictions might consider supplying the substance as a felony. But in this question, the options don't have first-degree murder (A), so perhaps the correct answer is C: second-degree murder.

But let me check the options. Option C is second-degree murder. So, the boyfriend was acting in a way that the statute would treat him as a felony for murder. He intended to cause serious bodily harm (by consuming strychnine), so the crime would be second-degree murder.

Alternatively, maybe he's guilty of assault. Attack with intent to cause serious injury. But in the scenario, the husband died from poisoning. So, he was attempting to kill, but perhaps the assault would require him to be in a position to attack. But in this case, he was just helping the woman, so he might not have been in a position to attack the husband. So, maybe he's not guilty of assault.

Alternatively, maybe he's guilty of a felony like supplying the substance, but that's not an option here. So the options are about what he can be convicted of.

Wait, another angle: If the husband died, and it was through poisoning, the trauma of that might lead to intent towards killing. But the question is about the boyfriend's own liability.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is first-degree murder because he was directly responsible for his wife's death, but he wasn't intending to kill. So that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps he's guilty of supplying the substance, but that's not an option. So, looking at the options, option C is second-degree murder, which would be applicable because he intended to cause serious bodily harm by consuming the poison. 

Wait, but the options don't have any of that. So, perhaps the correct answer is C: second-degree murder.

But I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think about when a person acts to supply a controlled substance. If the person is acting in their role as a helper, and the substance is known and given with the intent to cause harm, then they may be guilty of first-degree murder. But here, the husband died, but the question is about the boyfriend's own liability.

Wait, the question is about the most serious crime for which the boyfriend can be properly convicted. So, he's a premed student, which suggests he might have prior knowledge. He knew of the poison and obtained it for her. He helped her, and gave it to the husband, who died.

So, he provided the strychnine. In some jurisdictions, supplying a controlled substance is a felony, but it's not an option here. The options are A to J, so perhaps the correct answer is C: second-degree murder because he intended to cause serious bodily harm.

Alternatively, another possibility: the question says the statute provides that any intentional killing is first degree. But he didn't intend to kill, just cause death. So, it's not first-degree murder. So, he's guilty of second-degree murder because he intended to cause serious bodily harm.

So, the correct answer would be C: second-degree murder.

The woman contaminate her husband's guacamole with strychnine, intending to cause serious bodily harm by poisoning him. The boyfriend, acting as an agent, provided the strychnine to her husband, who died. Strychnine is a controlled substance, and supplying it is often considered a felony in some jurisdictions. However, the options provided do not include a separate felony for supplying the substance. Given the options, the closest match is that the boyfriend's actions would be treated as a felony for murder, specifically second-degree murder, as he intended to cause serious bodily harm. 

ANSWER: C
