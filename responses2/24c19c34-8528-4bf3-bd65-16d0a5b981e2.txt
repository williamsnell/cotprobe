Question:

Define a hormone. How would you go about proving that a particular gland is responsible for a specific function?

Options:

A: A hormone is a type of organ
B: A hormone is a type of tissue
C: A hormone is an electrical signal sent through the nervous system to communicate between different parts of the body.
D: A hormone is a mineral that is involved in maintaining the balance of water in the body.
E: A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood.
F: A hormone is a structural protein that makes up the components of muscles and tissues.
G: A hormone is a digestive enzyme that breaks down food in the stomach and intestines.
H: A hormone is a type of vitamin that the body needs in small amounts to function properly.
I: A hormone is a type of cell
J: A hormone is a biological molecule that remains within the organ it is produced in and affects only that specific organ.

Okay, so I've got this question here about hormones. Hmm, I should probably start by understanding what a hormone is. From what I remember, hormones are chemical substances that play various roles in the body. They don't carry physical traits, so they don't affect the body's appearance or characteristics. Instead, they influence the development of the body, the functions of organs, and the response to the environment.

Wait, the question asks how to prove that a particular gland is responsible for a specific function. So, maybe I should think about the structure and functions of different glands. For example, the testis produces sperm, which undergoes meiosis, but that's more about reproduction. The pancreas makes hormones like insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels. The pituitary gland produces adrenals, which control the release of hormones from the adrenals into the blood. The liver makes enzymes that break down food, and the parathyroid gland regulates calcium levels.

So, each gland's function is tied to a specific hormone. The question is about proving which gland is responsible for a particular function. How can we prove that? Probably by looking at the hormones they produce. For instance, the testis is linked to sperm production, which involves hormones from the testes themselves. The pancreas produces insulin and glucagon, which are crucial for blood sugar regulation. The liver makes enzymes that break down food, so if a certain enzyme is present, it's likely from the liver.

The options given are A through J. Each is a statement about what a hormone is. Option E says a hormone is a chemical substance produced by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood. That makes sense because hormones are synthesized and secreted by specific cells, like the liver making enzymes, the pancreas making hormones, etc. So if you can identify the organ or tissue that produces a particular hormone, you can link that hormone to the gland it's produced by.

Wait, the question is about proving a particular gland is responsible for a function. Suppose, for example, that someone claims the pancreas is responsible for insulin production. To prove this, you would look for hormones that are produced by the pancreas, like insulin. Then see if those hormones are present in the blood, indicating the pancreas is the source. So, the method would involve finding the hormone and linking it to the organ or tissue that produces it.

Looking at the options, option E seems correct. It's about the process of production and secretion. So the answer should be E. Other options don't quite fit. For example, option F talks about proteins in tissues, which is about enzymes and proteins, not hormones. Option G is about digestive enzymes, which are part of the digestive system but not directly the hormones. Option I says a hormone is a type of cell, which is incorrect because cells are the structural units, not the hormones themselves. Option J says a hormone is a biological molecule, which is right, but it's too broad and doesn't explain the mechanism of production.

To determine which hormone is responsible for a specific function, one should examine the hormones produced by the gland in question. For example, insulin is produced by the pancreas. To prove the pancreas is responsible for insulin production, you would look for hormones (like insulin) and verify their presence in the blood. Among the options provided, E correctly describes a hormone as a chemical substance produced by a specific organ or tissue and secreted into the blood. 

Answer: E
