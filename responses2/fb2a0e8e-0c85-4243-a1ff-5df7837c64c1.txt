Okay, so I have this question about a compound microscope, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about microscopes and magnification.

The question says the objective has a lateral magnification of 10x, and they want to know the focal length of the ocular (the eyepiece) that will produce an overall magnification of 100x. The options are A to J, with numbers in centimeters.

Hmm, I remember that the total magnification of a compound microscope is the product of the magnifications of the objective and the ocular. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is usually M_total = M_objective × M_eyepiece. But wait, sometimes I've seen it as M_total = M_objective + (M_eyepiece / 10), but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is M_total = M_objective × M_eyepiece. Because the objective provides a magnification of M_obj, and the eyepiece provides a magnification of M_e (like 10x for the human eye). So, when you multiply them, you get the total.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. The formula for the magnification of a compound microscope is indeed M = M_obj × M_e. So, the total magnification is the product of the objective's magnification and the eyepiece's magnification.

Wait, no, but wait another thought. Oh! I think the eyepiece's magnification is about 10, since the human eye's magnification is around 10x. So M_total = M_obj × M_e. So, if M_obj is 10x, then M_e must be 10x for the total to be 100x. Because 10 * 10 = 100.

So then, the eyepiece must have a magnification of 10x. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the eyepiece's magnification is considered as 1.25x or something else. Oh wait, no, the standard eyepiece is 10x, so that's correct.

So the question is asking for the focal length of the eyepiece that gives a 10x magnification. But wait, the standard eyepiece has a fixed focal length, right? I think the ocular (eyepiece) has a fixed focal length. Oh, wait, the problem might not be about the focal length, but perhaps the magnification. Wait, the question says 'ocular' which is the eyepiece. So it's about the focal length.

Wait, but wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. Let me re-read. The problem is: the last character must be the chosen option. So the options are given as lengths in cm. So the question is about the focal length of the ocular—so the eyepiece.

Wait, but wait again. The problem says the objective produces a lateral magnification of 10x. So M_obj =10. The total magnification is 100x, so M_total = M_obj * M_e. So M_e must be 10x. Because 10 *10=100. So the eyepiece's magnification is 10x.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, I'm getting confused. Because sometimes, the formula is M_total = M_obj + (M_e / 10). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because M_total would be more than M_obj if M_e is higher than 10. Oh, no, wait, the formula is M_total = M_obj * (1 + M_e / 10). Hmm, not sure. Let me think about it.

Wait, the formula for the magnification of a compound microscope is M = M_obj × (1 + M_e / 10). Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, the correct formula is M_total = M_obj × M_e, where M_e is the magnification of the eyepiece in terms of the ratio of image size to object size. If the eyepiece is considered to have a magnification of 10, then M_e is 10. So M_total is 10 *10 =100.

So for the magnification to be 100x, the eyepiece must have a magnification of 10x. So the focal length of the eyepiece is fixed. Wait, but wait, the options are about focal lengths. So perhaps for this question, the focal length is given, and we need to select the correct one.

Wait, the options are all focal lengths, like 5 cm, 6 cm, etc. So which option is correct for the eyepiece's focal length that gives a magnification of 10x.

Wait, but the question is about the focal length of the ocular. So what focal length does the eyepiece have to produce a 10x magnification.

Wait, but wait, for a standard compound microscope, the eyepiece is fixed at 10 cm (20 mm), but in this question, perhaps the options are giving possible focal lengths to see which one, when used as the eyepiece, provides the necessary magnification.

Wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the focal length of the ocular (eyepiece) that when used, the total magnification is 100x, given that the objective's magnification is 10x.

Wait, no, but if the eyepiece has a magnification of 10x, then the total will be 100x. So what's the focal length of the eyepiece when its magnification is 10x.

Wait, but wait, the length of the focal length in a microscope isn't directly related to the magnification beyond the formula. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the magnification of the eyepiece. Because the eyepiece's magnification is M_e. So M_e is 10x, which is the factor by which the image appears larger. But the question asks for the focal length of the ocular.

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Formula: M_total = M_obj × M_e.

2. M_obj is given as 10x.

3. M_total is 100x.

So 100 = 10 × M_e → M_e = 10.

So the eyepiece's magnification is 10x.

But the question is about the focal length of the ocular.

Wait, now I'm confused. The focal length of the ocular (eyepiece) isn't directly given by the magnification. The magnification depends on the focal length.

Wait, but perhaps in the problem, the options are given as focal lengths, and we're to find which one gives a certain magnification.

But the question specifically says, "the focal length of your answer must be the letter you've chosen"—so for this question, the correct answer is the focal length of the ocular that, when used with an objective of 10x, gives a total of 100x.

Wait, but earlier I thought the eyepiece's magnification has to be 10, but that's different from the question's focus.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's get this straight.

The formula for the total magnification of a compound microscope is M_total = M_objective × M eyepiece. So M eyepiece = M_total / M objective.

So M eyepiece is 100 / 10 =10x. So the eyepiece must have a magnification of 10x.

But the question is about the focus length of the eyepiece. So what is the formula connecting focal length and magnification?

Wait, the magnification of the eyepiece (M_e) is determined by the formula M_e = 1 + (f_o / f_e), where f_o is the focal length of the objective and f_e is the focal length of the ocular. Wait, I'm not sure about that formula. Alternatively, perhaps the magnification is about how much the image is enlarged. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: I think that the magnification of the eyepiece is determined by the formula M_e = (25 cm) / f_e. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, I think the magnification (as seen by the eye) is given by M = 25 / f_e, but that's when the object is placed at the focal point. But wait, in the case of a compound microscope, the object is placed at a specific distance (like near the focal point of the objective), so the eyepiece's magnification would be determined by the eyepiece's focal length.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M_e = (25 cm) / f_e. So M_e is the magnification of the eyepiece, which is 10x.

So, 10 = 25 / f_e → f_e = 25 /10 =2.5 cm. So the focal length of the ocular (eyepiece) is 2.5 cm.

Looking at the options: option D is 2.5 cm.

So the focus length is 2.5 cm. So the correct answer is D.
</think>

To determine the focal length of the ocular that will produce an overall magnification of 100x in a compound microscope, we start with the formula for the total magnification:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = M_{\text{objective}} \times M_{\text{eyepiece}}
\]

Given:
- The objective produces a lateral magnification of \( M_{\text{objective}} = 10x \).
- The overall magnification required is \( M_{\text{total}} = 100x \).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( M_{\text{eyepiece}} \):

\[
M_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{M_{\text{total}}}{M_{\text{objective}}} = \frac{100}{10} = 10
\]

Thus, the eyepiece must provide a magnification of \( M_{\text{eyepiece}} = 10x \). The magnification of the eyepiece (\( M_{\text{eyepiece}} \)) is determined by the formula:

\[
M_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{25 \, \text{cm}}{f_{\text{eyepiece}}}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( f_{\text{eyepiece}} \):

\[
f_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{25 \, \text{cm}}{M_{\text{eyepiece}}}
\]

Substituting \( M_{\text{eyepiece}} = 10 \):

\[
f_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{25 \, \text{cm}}{10} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}
\]

From the given options, the focal length of the ocular (eyepiece) is \( 2.5 \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to option D.
