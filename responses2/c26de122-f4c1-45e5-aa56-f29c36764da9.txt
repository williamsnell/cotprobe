Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about moral principles, specifically focusing on the distinction between different ethical theories. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about understanding what kind of objective moral principles allow us to rationally determine the right actions, and what kind of morality makes the morality context-dependent and subjective. The options are labeled A through J, each pairing two principles.

First, I need to recall what I know about different ethical theories. I remember that there are different types of objective and subjective moral systems.

I think the question is about distinguishing between objective and subjective moral systems. Oh wait, no, the question says it's about the objective and subjective aspects in determining what's right. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the two types of objective and subjective principles.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "Under ethical ________ objective moral principles can be rationally determined, while ethical under ________ morality is both context dependant and subjective."

So, the first blank is about objective principles that allow rational determination. The second blank is about a moral system that is both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, how do these concepts go? I remember that there are different categories of ethical theories. Objective moral principles are those that are universal, not tied to a particular culture, society, or individual. Subjective (or moral) principles differ because they can vary across contexts and individuals.

I think there are objective and subjective moral theories. Objective theories might include things like Utilitarianism, which is about maximizing happiness or utility. Subjective theories include things like Deontological ethics, which focus on moral obligation.

Wait, but the question is about objective and subjective aspects. Hmm. So the first blank is about objective principles. So which of the options includes an objective principle?

Looking at the options:

A: Relativism, Absolutism
B: Absolutism, Normativity
C: Subjectivism, Relativism
D: Absolutism, Relativism
E: Normativity, Absolutism
F: Normativity, Relativism
G: Relativism, Normativity
H: Relativism, Relativism
I: Absolutism, Absolutism
J: Absolutism, Subjectivism

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The first blank is about objective principles. So let's think about what each option pairs.

Option A: Relativism and Absolutism. Relativism is a moral theory that allows for context-dependent ethics. Absoluteism, perhaps, is the idea that certain principles are universally and irrationally accepted, like the rights of others.

Wait, wait. The first part is about objective principles. So the options are probably about the types of ethical theories. So the first part is an objective moral principle, and the second is a type of morality that's both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The question is about two things: 

1. Objective principles that allow rational determination of morality.
2. The type of morality (which could be a principle or a system) that is both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, maybe it's about the difference between objective and subjective principles. Let me think about how different ethical systems are categorized.

I think there are different types of objective ethical principles. For example, Utilitarianism is an objective approach that focuses on consequences of actions. Absoluteism is a term I'm not sure about, but perhaps it refers to a principle that is universally accepted.

Wait, maybe the first blank is about objective principles, like Utilitarianism is an objective principle. Then the second part is about a moral system that's both context-dependent and subjective, which would be a subjective system, like deontological ethics.

Wait, but the options don't have "Utilitarianism" as one of the choices in the first blank. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, I remember that objective moral principles are the ones that are not tied to a particular culture or society, like Utilitarianism, which is about maximizing good. Subjective moral principles are tied to individual values, like deontological ethics which focus on moral obligation.

But the question is about objective principles that can be rationally determined. So perhaps the first blank refers to an objective principle, like Utilitarianism, and the second to a moral system that's both context-dependent and subjective, which would be a deontological approach.

Wait, but the options are about the two parts. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Relativism, Absolutism
B: Absolutism, Normativity
C: Subjectivism, Relativism
D: Absolutism, Relativism
E: Normativity, Absolutism
F: Normativity, Relativism
G: Relativism, Normativity
H: Relativism, Relativism
I: Absolutism, Absolutism
J: Absolutism, Subjectivism

Wait, perhaps the first part is about an objective principle (like Utilitarianism), and the second part is a type of morality that's both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the options again. The first blank is about objective principles that allow rational determination. The second is about a morality that is both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, perhaps the first part is about objective moral principles, which are not tied to culture. The second is about a moral system that is based on subjective principles.

Alternatively, perhaps the first part refers to a principle that is objective (like Utilitarianism), and the second part refers to a system that is both context-dependent and subjective, which would be a deontological system.

Wait, another approach: the two blanks are about two different types of ethical systems.

The first blank: objective moral principles allow for rational determination. So, what are objective principles? They are principles that are universally accepted, not relative to culture or society. So, for example, Utilitarianism is objective because it's about maximizing good across all possible outcomes.

The second part: both context-dependent and subjective. That's a subjective system. Like deontological ethics, which focus on moral obligations and are not tied to any particular outcome.

Wait, but the options don't have "Utilitarianism" as a choice in the first blank, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the first part refers to the category of objective principles, which are identified as being based on universal principles (absolutism) or variable (relativism). The second part refers to a system where morality depends on context and individual subjective values.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, the first part is probably an objective principle. So I need to see which options have an objective part.

Looking at the options, options A and D have "Relativism" as the first part. But I think that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the first part is "Objective" and the second part is a type of morality.

Alternatively, perhaps the first blank is about the type of ethical principle, and the second is about the type of morality that is context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Relativism and Absolutism, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the question, the first blank is about objective principles that allow for rational determination. The second is about a moral system that is both context-dependent and subjective.

I think the first part refers to an objective principle, like Utilitarianism. The second part refers to deontological ethics, which is a type of subjective system.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Options:

D: Absolutism, Relativism

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the types of principles. There are objective and subjective ethical theories.

Objective theories include things like Utilitarianism (maximizing utility), which is an objective approach. Absolutism, I think, refers to a principle that is universally accepted, like the idea that certain fundamental rights and duties are considered right and good.

Wait, perhaps the first blank is about an objective principle, and the second is about a system that's both context-dependent and subjective, which would be a deontological system.

Alternatively, the first part is about an objective principle, and the second part is about a moral system that is both context-dependent (relativism) and subjective (subjective ethics).

Wait, but looking at the options, the first part is "Relativism" and "Absolutism" (option A), or "Absolutism" and "Relativism" (option D).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. The question is about the two types of objective and subjective principles.

Wait, maybe the two blanks are about two different types of principles. The first blank is about the type that allows rational determination, and the second is about the type that's both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, perhaps the first is about a principle that's objective, allowing for rational determination, and the second is about a system that's both context-dependent (like Relativism) and subjectivist (subjective ethics).

Alternatively, perhaps the first blank refers to an objective principle (such as Utilitarianism), and the second refers to a system that is both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (subjective ethics).

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option D: Absolutism, Relativism. Hmm. So first blank is about an absolute principle, second is Relativism.

Wait, but the first blank says "Under ethical__________ objective moral principles...", and the second is "ethical under _______ is both context dependant and subjective."

Wait, perhaps the first blank is referring to an absolute principle. So, for example, "Absolutism." Then the second part refers to a system that's both context-dependent and subjective, which would be Relativism.

Alternatively, perhaps the first blank refers to absolute principles (like Absolutism) and the second refers to Relativism.

Wait, but the options are presented as pairs, so the first is the first blank, the second is the second.

Looking at option D: Absolutism, Relativism.

Wait, the first blank is about objective principles, so perhaps it's "Absoluteism" (which is a type of objective principle). The second blank is "Relativism." But the question is about a system that is both context-dependent and subjective.

Alternatively, perhaps the first blank is about an objective principle (like Utilitarianism), and the second is about a system that is both context-dependent and subjective, which is deontological ethics.

Wait, but the options don't have "Utilitarianism" as a first blank. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the first blank is about an objective principle, such as "Absolutism" (which is an absolute principle), and the second is "Relativism," which is a system that's context-dependent and subjective.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the first blank refers to the type of moral principle. So, the first blank is about a principle that's objective, and the second is a system that's both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about what each option represents.

Looking at the options:

Option D: Absolutism, Relativism.

Option G: Relativism, Normativity.

Wait, maybe the first blank is about an absolute principle (Absolutism), and the second is about a system that's both context-dependent and subjective, which would be Relativism.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first blank is about "Relativism" as the type of principle, and the second is "Absolutism" as the type of system.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of another approach. The question is about the two types of objective and subjective principles.

Wait, maybe the two blanks are about two different types of principles. The first blank is about the type that allows for rational determination, and the second is about the type that's context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, perhaps the first is about a principle that's objective (like Utilitarianism), and the second is about a system that's both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (deontological ethics).

But the options don't have "Relativism" and "deontological ethics" as a pair. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first blank is about an objective principle, which is "Absolutism" (a concept of something being true regardless of circumstances), and the second blank is about a system that's both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (deontological ethics).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the two parts. The first part refers to an objective principle that allows for rational determination. So, the first part is an objective principle. Which option pairs an objective principle with a system that's both context-dependent and subjective?

Looking at the options, perhaps the first blank is "Relativism" (a principle that's context-dependent), and the second blank is "Abolutism" (a type of objective principle). But wait, none of the options have "Abolutism" as the first blank.

Wait, perhaps the first blank is "Absolutism," which is a type of objective principle, and the second blank is "Relativism," which is a type of system that's both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: Relativism, Absolutism

B: Absolutism, Normativity

C: Subjectivism, Relativism

D: Absolutism, Relativism

E: Normativity, Absolutism

F: Normativity, Relativism

G: Relativism, Normativity

H: Relativism, Relativism

I: Absolutism, Absolutism

J: Absolutism, Subjectivism

Wait, perhaps the first blank is about a type of principle, like "Relativism" as a system, and the second is "Absolutism" as the type of system.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first blank refers to an objective principle, and the second blank refers to a system that's both context-dependent and subjective. So, for example, the first blank could be "Relativism" (which is a type of system that's context-dependent and subjective), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first blank is about an objective principle, and the second is about a system that is both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (deontological ethics). But I think that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct pair is "Absolutism" and "Relativism." Because the first blank is about an objective principle, and the second is about a system that's context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, no. I'm getting stuck here, perhaps I should try to remember standard ethical theories.

I think "Absolutism" refers to a principle that is universally accepted, like the idea that certain fundamental values are considered right and good.

"Relativism" refers to the idea that values and principles vary across cultures and contexts.

So, the first blank is about an objective principle, like "Absolutism," which says that certain things are right regardless of context.

The second blank is about a system that is both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (like deontological ethics, which is subjective).

Wait, but the options don't have "Relativism" as the second part. Alternatively, the second part may be about a system that's both context-dependent (relativism) and subjective (subjective ethics), but I don't think that's one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second blank refers to a system that's both context-dependent and subjective, which would be "Relativism."

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is "Absolutism, Relativism", and option G is "Relativism, Normativity". Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: Absolutism, Relativism. So the first blank is "Absolutism" (an objective principle), and the second is "Relativism" (a system that's both context-dependent and subjective).

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the first blank refers to "Relativism" as the objective principle, but that doesn't make sense because Relativism is a system, not a principle.

Wait, perhaps the first blank is "Relativism" (the system), and the second is "Absolutism" (the type of principle). But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the types of objective and subjective principles in their own right.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

Option D: Absolutism, Relativism.

Option G: Relativism, Normativity.

Option E: Normativity, Absolutism.

I think the first blank refers to an objective principle, so "Relativism" is a system that is context-dependent and subjective. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the first blank is about an objective principle, like "Absolutism" (which allows for rational determination), and the second is about a system that's both context-dependent and subjective, which would be "Relativism." But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first blank is about "Absolutism" (an objective principle), and the second blank is about a system that is both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (deontological ethics), but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: Absolutism, Relativism.

Wait, I'm not sure, but perhaps the first blank is about an objective principle (like "Absolutism"), and the second is about a system that's both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (subjective ethics), which would make sense. So, the answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G: Relativism, Normativity.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck.

Wait, looking back, the first blank is about an objective principle that allows for rational determination. The second is about a system that is both context-dependent and subjective.

Wait, perhaps the first blank is "Relativism" as the type of principle, and the second blank is "Absolutism" as the type of system.

Wait, but the options don't pair that.

Alternatively, perhaps the first blank is about an absolute principle (like the idea that certain things are right regardless of context), and the second is about a system that is both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (subjective ethics).

Looking at the options, the first blank is the first option in the pair.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: Absolutism, Relativism.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G: Relativism, Normativity.

Hmm. I think I'm going around in circles here, but I'll try to make a decision.

Wait, from what I remember, the first part refers to an objective principle, like "Absolutism" (which allows for rational determination), and the second part refers to a system that's both context-dependent (Relativism) and subjective (deontological ethics). But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the second part refers to a system that's both context-dependent and subjective, which would be "Relativism."

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: Absolutism, Relativism.

So, putting it all together: The first blank is about an objective principle, which is "Absolutism." The second blank is about a system that is both context-dependent and subjective, which would be "Relativism." But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct pairing.

Wait, perhaps the first blank refers to a principle that's objective and the second is a system that's both context-dependent and subjective. So, for example, "Relativism" as the first part and "Absolutism" as the second.

Wait, no. I'm getting confused.

Another approach: The options are about the type of ethical principles.

The first blank is about objective principles. So which type is it? For example, Utilitarianism is objective, so if the first blank is "Utilitarianism," then the second blank would have to be something else.

But looking at the options, the first blank is either "Relativism" or "Absolutism."

Wait, perhaps the first blank is about an absolute principle (like "Absolutism"), and the second blank is about a system that's both context-dependent and subjective (which would be "Relativism" and "Normativity"? No, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G: Relativism, Normativity.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D: Absolutism, Relativism.

Hmm. I'm not sure. I think I'll have to go with option D: Absolutism, Relativism.
</think>

The correct answer is D: Absolutism, Relativism.

Explanation:

- The first blank refers to an objective principle. "Absolutism" is a type of principle that is universally accepted and does not depend on context or culture.
- The second blank refers to a type of system that is both context-dependent and subjective. "Relativism" is a system that allows for context-dependent evaluations, while "Deontological Ethics" is a system that is subjective, focusing on moral obligation rather than utility.

Thus, the answer is D: Absolutism, Relativism.
