Alright, so I've got this question about the TV series 'Bonanza' and who wasn't one of its Cartwright sons. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to work it out step by step.

First, I know that 'Bonanza' is an animated TV series, right? It's a fan-favorite show. The question mentions the Cartwright family, so I should think about their family members. The options are Little Joe, Adam, Hoss, Ben, etc.

I remember that the Cartwright family includes several characters from 'Bonanza'. Let me list them out to be sure. The main characters are Little Joe, Ben, and Adam. Hoss is another character, but I'm not sure if he's a son. 

Wait, Ben is definitely a character. He's one of the main antagonists. Adam is another main character, but is he a son of the Cartwright family? I think the family consists of Ben, Adam, and Little Joe. Hoss might be a sibling, but not a son. So Hoss isn't part of the Cartwright family, hence he wouldn't be one of the sons.

So the question is asking who wasn't a son. The options are A: Little Joe (son), B: Adam (son), C: Hoss (not a son), D: Ben (son). So the answer should be C: Hoss.

The correct answer is **C: Hoss**, as he is not a son of the Cartwright family.
