Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about differential diagnosis between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my心理学, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are both eating disorders. The question asks what's a key feature to distinguish them. The options are A to J, with F being "All of the above." Let me go through each option.

Option A: Use of laxatives. Both disorders involve anabolic processes, so I think they both use laxatives. So A is probably not a distinguishing feature.

Option B: Purging. Purging is a common symptom in both. When someone purge, they start eating again after eating something heavy. So B might be a feature to look for.

Option C: Fear of gaining weight. I think that's more characteristic of anorexia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa is more about avoiding weight gain, while anorexia specifically deals with eating disorders. So C could be a key feature.

Option D: Bingeing. Bingeing is a symptom in both. So D is a feature.

Option E: Excessive exercise. Both disorders are associated with physical activity, but the exercise itself isn't the feature. So E might not be the key difference.

Option F: All of the above. That would mean all features are correct, but I think C (the fear of gaining weight) might not be a feature of bulimia nervosa. I'm not sure about that.

Option G: Maintaining normal body weight. Both disorders are about weight loss or maintenance. So G is probably not a feature.

Option H: Overeating in short periods. Both disorders often involve eating more than usual, so H would be a feature.

Option J: None of the above. If none of the options are correct, then J would be the answer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about a key feature for differentiating between bulimia and anorexia. Both disorders involve excessive eating, but bulimia is more about avoiding weight gain, while anorexia is about gaining it. So their fear of gaining weight (option C) might be a key point. Also, their bingeing (option D) is a symptom. Purging (B) is a common symptom. Overeating in short periods (H) is a behavior characteristic of both.

Wait, but what about maintaining normal weight? Both have that, so G is correct. So the key feature would be C and others. Wait, but the options are presented as single features. So perhaps the correct answer is H because the fear of gaining weight is a common trait, making it a distinguishing feature. Alternatively, all the others are correct, but the question says "a key feature," implying one of them. So I'm a bit mixed up.

Wait, the question says "one of the key features for making a differential diagnosis." So the correct answer would be the one that's a feature but not a common one. Or perhaps the answer is F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is H because it's a key trait.

Alternatively, since the question is about a key feature, perhaps it's all of the above except one. Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by avoiding weight gain, so C is a feature. Anorexia nervosa is about gaining weight. So their traits would include C, but the question is about a feature, not all features. So the question is asking for what's a common feature that distinguishes between the two. So perhaps C is a distinguishing feature.

Wait, the options are each either a feature or not. The options are presented as possible answers for the question, which asks for what's a key feature. So if the correct answer is H, that would mean all the above except one are correct. Wait, no, the options are about what makes them differ.

Wait, another approach: the options are A to J. The question is asking which is a key feature for making a differential diagnosis. So, for example, the key feature would be the one that's a symptom of one disorder but not the other.

So, bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa share some features, but the key differentiating feature would be the one that's not shared.

Looking at the options again:

A: Use of laxatives: Both use laxatives (so A is not a distinguishing feature).

B: Purging: Both have it.

C: Fear of gaining weight: Only anorexia (since bulimia is about avoiding it). So C is a key feature.

D: Bingeing: Both have it.

E: Excessive exercise: Both have it.

F: All of the above: If all are correct, then F is correct. But I'm not sure.

Wait, what's the correct differential diagnosis? Both have purging, bingeing, and excessive exercise. They both avoid weight gain (C). So all the options except C are correct features. But looking at the options, I think the answer is F because the question is about a key feature, and F says all of the above. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the key feature is C, the fear of gaining weight. Or perhaps F is correct because all features are common but the correct answer is F.

Wait, the question says "one of the key features," so it's looking for a single answer. So if all options except C are correct, but C is a correct feature, then F is correct. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Overeating in short periods, as that's a behavior characteristic of both, but that's not a distinguishing trait. So perhaps the correct answer is C, but then why is someone being asked about F?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about a key feature for making a differential diagnosis between bulimia and anorexia. Both disorders share the same features, but the key difference is what?

Wait, I think the main distinguishing feature is the fear of gaining weight. Because bulimia is about avoiding it, while anorexia is about gaining it. So C is a key feature.

But the question is about a key feature, so perhaps C is the correct answer.

Wait, but another angle: All the options except C are common features. So if the question is asking for a key feature that's a distinguishing trait, then all except C are correct. But the options are presented as possible answers, and F is "All of the above," which would mean all except C are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, as it's a behavior that's a common attribute of both. But no, the question is about a feature, not a behavior.

I'm getting stuck. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, which is "All of the above." But I thought C was a distinguishing feature. So perhaps the correct answer is H, but that's not a feature.

Wait, I'm really not sure. Let me think about the possible answers. The options are:

F: All of the above.

Which would mean that bulimia and anorexia share all the features except C. So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but I thought C is a feature. So perhaps F is correct because all the options except C are features.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: Overeating in short periods. No, because both disorders involve that.

Wait, I think the key feature is C: the fear of gaining weight. Because bulimia is about avoiding it, and anorexia is about gaining it.

So the correct answer is C, but looking at the options, the answer options don't include a choice for C. Wait, the options are A to J. The options are:

F: All of the above.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The question is about the key feature that differentiates them. Both have purging, bingeing, and excessive exercise. The only difference is whether they're about weight gain or weight loss. So the key feature is whether they're about weight gain (C) or weight loss (no, they're about weight loss, so C is about the fear of gaining weight, which is a feature in both).

Wait, but the question is about a key feature, so the correct answer would be C, but the options don't have C as an option. Wait, no, the options are:

A: Use of laxatives

B: Purging

C: Fear of gaining weight

D: Bingeing

E: Excessive exercise

F: All of the above

G: Maintaining a normal body weight

H: Overeating in short periods

I: None of the above

J: Self-imposed starvation

Wait, so F is "All of the above," which would mean that all these are key features. But I thought C is a distinguishing feature, so F would be incorrect. So if the correct answer is F, then all the options are correct. But I'm not sure because C is a feature.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H, but that's not a distinguishing trait. So I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps all the options except C are correct, so F is correct.

But wait, the question is about a key feature for making a differential diagnosis. So the correct answer would be the one that differentiates them. For example, the key feature is the fear of gaining weight, which is a distinguishing trait.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps all the options except C are correct, so the correct answer is F.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is F, meaning all of the above are features. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is all except C. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the correct answer is F, as it's the only option that mentions all the features except C. So F would be correct.

The question asks for a key feature to distinguish between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Both disorders share several features, such as purging, bingeing, and excessive exercise. However, the distinguishing feature lies in the fear of gaining weight (option C), which is a hallmark of anorexia nervosa. Bulimia nervosa, on the other hand, is characterized by avoiding weight gain, while anorexia nervosa is associated with gaining weight. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Use of laxatives — Both disorders use laxatives, so this is not a distinguishing feature.
- **B**: Purging — Both disorders exhibit purging as a symptom, making this a common feature.
- **C**: Fear of gaining weight — This is a key feature of anorexia nervosa, making it a distinguishing trait.
- **D**: Bingeing — Both disorders exhibit bingeing as a symptom.
- **E**: Excessive exercise — Both disorders are associated with excessive exercise.
- **F**: All of the above — This would imply that all options are correct, but this is incorrect because option C is a distinguishing feature.
- **G**: Maintaining a normal body weight — Both disorders involve normal body weight maintenance.
- **H**: Overeating in short periods — This is a common behavior in both disorders.
- **I**: None of the above — Incorrect, as F is not entirely accurate.
- **J**: Self-imposed starvation — Not directly related to the distinction between the disorders.

Given that the question asks for a key feature, the most accurate answer is **C: Fear of gaining weight**, as it is a distinguishing trait unique to anorexia nervosa. However, since the options are structured to consider all features except C, the broader answer would be **F: All of the above**, which is technically correct but misleading because it includes a non-distinguishing feature.

ANSWER: F
