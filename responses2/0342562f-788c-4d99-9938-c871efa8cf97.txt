Okay, so I've got this psychological question about how TV programming relates to aggression. Hmm, let me think through this. The question is asking what the results of most psychological studies imply about TV programming. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that psychological studies often talk about how different types of content affect people's behavior. aggression is a pretty serious topic. I think there are various types of TV programming—like drama, comedy, news, reality TV, etc.—and each might have different effects.

I recall that some studies have shown that certain types of programming can influence mood and behavior. For example, reality TV shows often have high drama and tension, which might make viewers feel more anxious or aggressive. On the other hand, news programs or educational content could be more neutral, promoting information without the immediate threat of aggression.

Looking at the options:

A: TV is the only cause of aggression. That doesn't sound right because other factors like environment, personal factors, etc., are also significant.

B: Aggression on TV promotes conflict resolution. That seems plausible. If viewers are exposed to situations that make them aggressive, maybe they try to resolve conflicts more effectively.

C: Programming with prosocial messages increases aggression. I don't think that's the case. Prosocial content, like education or community building, probably makes viewers feel better and less aggressive. Prosocial is good for positive behavior.

D: Violent TV increases aggression. I don't see evidence that violent content directly causes aggression. More about the mental state than the content itself.

E: TV causes passive behavior, not aggression. That doesn't fit. Passive behavior is more about how you act, not the immediate aggression.

F: Non-violent TV increases aggression. I'm not sure about this one. It's possible that non-violent content (like drama or news) might lead to more aggressive behavior if viewers are exposed to negative stereotypes or if they're just not feeling safe.

Wait, I think there's a study by Buss and colleagues (2005) where they found that drama shows can increase aggression. So option F might be correct. But I'm not certain.

G: aggression in TV reflects society. That's more of a sociocultural perspective. The question is about the influence of TV on aggression, not the societal effects.

H: No effect. That doesn't make sense because I remember some studies showing effects.

I: No effect. Same as H.

J: Effects unknown. So the answer might be that the effect is unknown, which would be option J.

Wait, but I'm more confident that F is correct. If non-violent TV (like drama or news) leads to more aggression, then F would be the right answer. Alternatively, if the effect is unknown, J could be the answer.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about the results of psychological studies. So if a study found that non-violent TV (like drama or news) leads to higher aggression, then F would make sense. But if the studies didn't find a significant effect, J would be the answer.

I think more about this: I remember reading that reality TV can increase aggression because viewers feel attacked and they might be more aggressive in response. So non-violent TV (like drama, news, or reality TV) can increase aggression. So option F would be correct.

Alternatively, if the study didn't find any effect, then J would be the answer. But I think F is a possible correct answer.

Wait, another angle: the question is about what most psychological studies imply. So if the studies don't support F, then J would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of the options again.

Option F says non-violent TV increases aggression. Based on what I know, reality TV can increase aggression because the viewers feel attacked. So studies might support F.

But another thought: some studies might have found that non-violent content doesn't necessarily increase aggression. Or maybe the effect varies. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, option J says effects are unknown, which would be the case if the studies didn't find a clear positive association.

Wait, but the question is about what the results imply. So if the studies support F, then F is correct. If they don't find a significant effect, J is correct.

I think in the context of this question, the correct answer is F, because non-violent TV (like drama or news) can lead to increased aggression as per some studies. So the answer is F.
</think>

The correct answer is F: Non-violent television programming increases aggression. This conclusion is based on the understanding that certain types of television content, such as drama and news, can influence viewers' mental states and behaviors, potentially leading to increased aggression. Studies suggest that non-violent content may contribute to heightened aggression, making option F a plausible choice. 

Answer: F
