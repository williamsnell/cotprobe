Okay, so I've got this question about a product liability case. Let me try to think it through. So the scenario is that Bill bought a can of Sipep from Ajax Minimart. After drinking it, he found dead insects stuck on the inside bottom of the can. Now, in a strict product liability tort action against Ajax, Bill has to prove a few things. I need to figure out which of the options A to D are the relevant parts of that proof.

First, I remember that in product liability cases, when you're proving that a product is defective, you have to show that the product is not as described. So Bill needs to show that the Sipep is defective. The question is about the specific evidence Bill must prove.

Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. Hmm, that's about whether the product was sold by the seller. In a strict liability case, the seller isn't directly liable unless the product is defective. So I think this is more of an assumption, not a strict liability proof. The seller can't be held liable for selling a defective product. So maybe A isn't the correct answer.

Option B: Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition. Wait, no, in product liability cases, the seller isn't liable for the defects inherent in the product unless they were a defect in the manufacturing process. The standard is that the seller isn't liable for the defects in the product itself. So B might not be the right answer here. The seller has to prove the product is defective, not that the seller knew of the defect.

Option C: Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems with Sipep products. Hmm. Oh wait, I think in some jurisdictions, if the seller has a history of defective products, they can be held liable for subsequent defective products. But wait, in a strict liability case, the seller isn't liable for their own product being defective unless it was a defect in the manufacturing. So if the product is defective, the seller isn't liable, regardless of prior issues. So I don't think C is relevant here. The problem is about the product's condition, not prior notice.

Option D: Ajax actually placed the dead insects into the can. Oh, wait a second. I think that's about whether the product was defective or defective due to manufacturing. So the question is, is the can defective? If the product is defective, then the seller isn't liable. So D is about whether the defect was present. But wait, another thought: the question is about proving that the can is defective. So Bill needs to show that it's defective, not that it was defective because the seller knew about it.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in a strict liability case, the seller isn't liable for their own product's defects unless the defect was in the manufacturing process. So the product's own defects are not the issue. 

So the options again:

A: Seller selling the product. Not the issue.

B: Seller knew about the defect. Not relevant.

C: Seller knew prior similar issues. Not relevant.

D: Seller placed the defect. So if the can had a defect, the seller isn't liable. So Bill must prove that the can is defective. So D is saying that the seller actually put the defect in. If that's true, then the can is defective, and the seller isn't liable.

Wait, but the question says Bill must prove that the can is defective. So the correct evidence is that the seller actually placed the defect. So D would be correct.

But wait, in some product liability cases, if the seller has a history of defective products, they can be held liable for subsequent ones. But that's under product liability laws where the seller is liable for their own defect. But in strict liability, the seller isn't liable.

Wait, but the question is about Bill proving that the can is defective. So if the product is defective, the seller isn't liable. So the proof would be about the product's defect, not the seller's history.

So the correct evidence Bill must prove is that the can is defective. That would be option D: Ajax actually placed the dead insects into the can. Because if the can is defective, then the seller isn't liable.

To determine which option Bill must prove in his product liability case, we analyze each choice:

- **Option A**: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. This is an assumption about the seller's role and not relevant to proving the product's defect.
- **Option B**: Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition. This pertains to the seller's knowledge of the defect, which isn't relevant in a strict liability case.
- **Option C**: Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems. This relates to prior issues with the product, not the current defect.
- **Option D**: Ajax actually placed the dead insects into the can. This directly addresses the product's defect, which is the focus of proving the can's condition.

In a strict liability case, the seller isn't liable for the product's defect unless it was a defect in the manufacturing process. Therefore, Bill must prove the can is defective by showing the seller placed the defect, making **Option D** correct.
