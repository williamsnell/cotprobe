Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question says: Given that n > 1, what is the smallest positive integer n whose positive divisors have a product of n^6? The options are A through J, with various numbers. I need to find the smallest n that satisfies this condition.

First, let me understand what the question is asking. I know that for any positive integer n, the product of all its positive divisors is known, and there's a formula for that. I think the product of all divisors of n is n^(d(n)/2), where d(n) is the number of divisors of n. Let me check that.

Wait, no, maybe I mixed it up. Oh right, the product of the divisors is n^(k), where k is the number of divisors divided by 2. Because divisors come in pairs multiplying to n. So if d(n) is the number of divisors, then the product is n^(d(n)/2). So the product of all divisors is n to the power of half the number of divisors.

But the question says the product is n^6. So we have n^6 = product of divisors. Which is equal to n^(d(n)/2). So setting them equal: n^6 = n^(d(n)/2). Since n is greater than 1, we can take logarithms or just equate the exponents. So 6 = d(n)/2. Therefore, d(n) = 12.

So the number of divisors of n, d(n), must be 12. So the problem is now to find the smallest n such that it has exactly 12 divisors.

Now, I should recall how the number of divisors works. The number of divisors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. If n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, where p's are primes, then the number of divisors is (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).

So we need (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1) = 12. So I need to find exponents a1, a2,... such that their increments multiply to 12. So I'll factor 12 into integers greater than 1, because each ai+1 is at least 2 (since ai is at least 1). 

The possible factorizations of 12 are:
1. 12 = 12 → (11)
2. 12 = 6*2 → (5,1)
3. 12 = 4*3 → (3,2)
4. 12 = 3*2*2 → (2,1,1)
5. 12 = 2*2*3 → same as above, but different order of factors.

So each of these corresponds to different exponents in the prime factors.

Now, to find the smallest n, I want to assign the largest exponents to the smallest primes. Because smaller primes raised to higher powers contribute less to the overall size of n.

So for each case:

Case 1: a1 = 11 → n = 2^11 = 2048. That's one option. But let's see the other cases.

Case 2: a1=5, a2=1 → n = 2^5 *3^1 = 32*3 =96. That's smaller than 2048.

Case3: a1=3, a2=2 → n=2^3 *3^2 = 8*9=72. 72 is smaller than 96.

Case4: a1=2, a2=1, a3=1 → n=2^2 *3^1 *5^1 =4*3*5=60. That's even smaller than 72.

Wait, so 60 is the smallest so far. Let me check the other cases as well. Are there any other factorizations?

Wait, 12 can also be written as 2*2*3, which is the same as case 4. So that's covered.

What about 12 = 2*2*3, which is the same as 3*2*2. So I think these are the only factorizations.

So the possible exponents:

Case1: 11 → so n=2048.

Case2: 5 and 1 → 96.

Case3: 3 and 2 →72.

Case4: 2,1,1 →60.

Is there a case where exponents are arranged differently? For example, exponents 2,1,1, and 2^2 *3^1 *5^1 *7^1 *... but that would require more factors, which would increase the product. So no, 4 factors would be the minimum, so 2^2 *3 *5 is the minimal.

Wait, let's confirm. For n=60, its prime factors are 2^2 *3^1 *5^1. So the number of divisors is (2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=3*2*2=12. Correct.

But wait, is there a number smaller than 60 that has 12 divisors? Let's think.

Numbers smaller than 60: let's see what's the next possible.

For example, 48: 48= 2^4 *3^1. So the number of divisors is (4+1)(1+1)=5*2=10, which is less than 12. So 48 has 10 divisors.

What about 60 is the next one.

Wait, 36: 36=2^2 *3^2. So number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1)=9. So 9, which is less than 12.

Another number, 40: 40=2^3 *5^1. Number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1)=4*2=8. Less than 12.

What about 60: 60=2^2*3*5 → (2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=3*2*2=12. So yes, 60 has 12 divisors.

Is there any number smaller than 60 that has 12 divisors? Let's think.

Wait, 36 has 9, 60 is next. What about 30: 30=2*3*5. So number of divisors is (1+1)^3=8. Less than 12.

How about 42: 42=2*3*7 → divisors 8.

Wait, what about 24: 24=2^3 *3^1 → number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1)=4*2=8.

What about 48: 2^4 *3 → divisors 5*2=10.

Then 30:8, 42:8, 48:10, 60:12.

So 60 is the next after 48, which has 10. So 60 is the smallest n with 12 divisors.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are 2048, 30, 60, 120, 36, 72, 20, 12, 10, 64, 36? Wait no, the options are:

Options:

A: 2048

B:30

C:60

D:120

E:36

F:72

G:20

H:12

I:10

J:64

So the smallest is 10? Wait no, wait 10 has 4 divisors: 1,2,5,10. So 10's number of divisors is 4, which isn't 12. So 10 would have product of divisors n^2, since d(n)=4, so product is n^2. So for 10, n^2 would be the product. But the question says the product is n^6. So 10's product is 10^2, not 10^6. So 10 is out.

Wait, let's double-check. The product of the divisors is n^(d(n)/2), so if n=10, d(n)=4, product is 10^2=100. But the question requires it to be 10^6. So 10 is not a candidate.

So the next possible is 60. So 60 is the smallest n with 12 divisors, so the answer is 60, which is option C.
</think>

The number of positive divisors of \( n \) is 12, so \( n \) must have a prime factorization with exponents that multiply to 12 when each exponent is increased by 1. The smallest \( n \) is \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 = 60 \).

Answer: C: 60
