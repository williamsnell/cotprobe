Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the expansion of air during a thermonuclear explosion. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that one cubic foot of air is heated from 0°C to 546,000°C. I need to find the volume it expands to. Hmm, I remember something about thermal expansion. Oh right, the formula for volume expansion is related to the coefficient of volume expansion. But wait, what's the coefficient for air?

Wait, I think air isn't perfectly incompressible, but generally, the expansion is considered using the coefficient of volume expansion. Oh right, for gases, the volume expansion depends on the temperature change, and the formula is ΔV = V0 * β * ΔT, where β is the coefficient. But wait, wait, what's the value of β for air? I think it's something like β ≈ 1/273 per degree Celsius. Oh wait, actually, I'm not sure. Wait no, the coefficient of volume expansion for gases is often approximated as (1/273) per degree Celsius. Or is it 3/273? Wait, no, wait. I remember that for gases, the volume expansion coefficient β is approximately 1/273 per °C. Or is it 3/273? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, the coefficient is β ≈ 1/273, which is approximately 0.00366 per °C. So that makes sense. Because for many gases, the expansion coefficient is about 1/(273 K) per °C, which is the same as 1/(273) per °C because Kelvin is Celsius shifted by 273.

So, if that's the case, then with β = 1/273 per °C, the change in volume would be V = V0 * β * ΔT. But wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is ΔV = V0 * β * ΔT. But wait, the coefficient β is usually expressed as the fractional change per degree. So, the volume change is V = V0 * β * ΔT.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the initial volume is 1 cubic foot. So, V0 is 1 ft³. The initial temperature is 0°C, and the final is 546,000°C. So the change in temperature is ΔT = 546,000 - 0 = 546000 degrees. That's a massive change. So, plugging into the formula: ΔV = 1 * (1/273) * 546000. Let me compute that.

Wait, 546000 divided by 273 is equal to... let's see. 273 times 2000 is 546000, right? Because 273*2000=546000. So 546000 / 273 = 2000. So ΔV is 1 * (1/273) * 546000 = 2000 ft³. So the volume increases by 2000 ft³. So the new volume is V0 + ΔV = 1 + 2000 = 2001 ft³. So the new volume is 2001 ft³.

Looking at the options, option I is 2001 ft³. So the answer must be I.

To determine the volume expansion of one cubic foot of air heated from 0°C to 546,000°C, we use the formula for thermal expansion:

\[
\Delta V = V_0 \cdot \beta \cdot \Delta T
\]

where:
- \( V_0 = 1 \, \text{ft}^3 \) (initial volume),
- \( \beta \approx \frac{1}{273} \, \text{per °C} \) (coefficient of volume expansion for air),
- \( \Delta T = 546,000 - 0 = 546,000 \, \text{°C} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta V = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{273} \cdot 546,000
\]

Since \( 546,000 / 273 = 2000 \), we find:

\[
\Delta V = 2000 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

The new volume is:

\[
V = V_0 + \Delta V = 1 + 2000 = 2001 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is **I: 2001 ft³**.
