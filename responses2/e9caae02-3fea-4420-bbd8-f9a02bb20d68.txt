Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Federal Reserve System's instruments of control. Hmm, I remember the Federal Reserve does a lot of things to manage the economy. Let me think.

The question is asking which two are principal and selective instruments. Wait, I think principal instruments are the main ones, and the selective are the ones that are used in specific ways. But maybe the question is just about the principal ones, which are the primary tools the Fed uses.

I remember that the Federal Reserve primarily uses open-market operations. That's where they buy and sell government securities to affect the money supply. When the Fed buys bonds, they inject money into the economy, which can increase the money supply and stimulate the economy. So that's an open-market operation.

Then, another instrument is the federal funds rate. The Fed sets the rate at which banks lend their excess reserves to each other overnight. A lower rate makes it easier for banks to borrow money, decreasing the money supply. A higher rate makes borrowing harder, so more money is held. So the federal funds rate is another instrument.

Wait, what about the discount rate? Oh right, the discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for loans from the Fed. Increasing the discount rate makes it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed, so they might borrow less. That would decrease the money supply. So if the Fed increases the discount rate, it's a selective instrument because it's not the main tool but can be used in conjunction with others.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Open-market, national budget (not sure about that), and federal funds. Wait, national budget is more about government spending and revenue, so probably not a primary control tool. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Open-market, discount rate, reserve requirements. Wait, reserve requirements are about how much banks can hold, which affects the money supply. So this option includes reserve requirements, which is a selective instrument. But the question is about principal and selective. I'm not sure how this fits.

Option C: Adjust federal funds, quantitative easing, tax rates. Federal funds is correct, but quantitative easing is a specific policy, not an instrument but more of a broader approach. So option C might include a selective tool, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Interest rate adjustments, liquidity ratio changes, open-market. Wait, I'm not sure about liquidity ratio. Maybe that's a mix-up. Open-market is correct. Liquidity ratio changes might relate to reserve requirements, not sure.

Option E: Capital gains tax, reserve requirements, federal funds. Not matching.

Option F: Discount rate changes, direct lending, exchange rate. Direct lending is part of open-market, exchange rate is more about Fed's policy but not an instrument.

Option G: Discount rate changes, margin requirements, deposit rates. Discount rate is correct, but I'm not sure about this option's relevance.

Option H: Issuing new currency, inflation target, open-market. Issuing new currency is part of monetary policy, but the target is about the rate, not an instrument. Open-market is correct.

Option I: Prime rate changes, reserve requirements, bond purchases. Prime rate is a rate set by the central bank, but reserve requirements are a reserve requirement. So option I includes reserve requirements, which is a selective tool.

Option J: Income tax changes, reserve requirements, discount rate. Inverse of option I, but not directly relevant.

Wait, let me go back. The question asks for principal and selective instruments. So the principal ones are the main tools—open-market operations and federal funds rate. But the options might mix in others.

Looking again at option B: Open-market, discount rate, reserve requirements. So that's three. But the question is about two principal and one selective. Wait, maybe the question is looking for two principal and two select, but the options are given as two instruments each.

Wait, the options list two and one. Let me think.

Option B says principal and selective. So the principal ones are open-market and perhaps discount rate? Or maybe the principal is open-market, and select is another.

Wait, the question is about which are the principal and selective. The principal would be the main tools. So the principal would be open-market and federal funds rate. But option B includes discount rate as a principal, which is incorrect. So maybe the principal are open-market and another. Hmm.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the principal as two main tools, and one additional, but the options have two and one.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the principal and selective. So option I: changes in the prime rate (which is a rate, but is a policy tool, not an instrument), reserve requirements (a rate set by Fed, so another instrument), and bond purchases (which is a policy tool, so also an instrument). So option I uses reserve requirements as a selective instrument.

Wait, but the question is about principal and selective. So perhaps the correct answer is option I's instruments. Or I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the Federal Reserve uses the discount rate and the federal funds rate as primary tools. So the principal would be discount rate and federal funds. But looking at the options:

Looking at option D: interest rate adjustments (which is another term for the discount rate), liquidity ratio (maybe reserve requirements), and open-market. So interest rate adjustments is part of principal. But option D includes liquidity ratio, which I think is a reserve requirement. So D has three, but the question is about two principal and one selective.

Alternatively, think about the options. Let's check which ones involve the Fed's primary tools.

Option B: Open-market, discount rate, and reserve requirements. Open-market is principal, discount rate is a rate (principal), and reserve requirements are a rate (also principal). So this includes all three as principal. But the question asks for two principal and one selective. So this can't be the right option.

Option F: changes in discount rate, direct lending to banks (which is another form of open-market), exchange rate. Hmm, but exchange rate is more a policy variable, not an instrument.

Option I: changes in prime rate (another rate), reserve requirements (rate), and bond purchases (a policy tool). Wait, prime rate is a rate, so it's a rate, but is that a principal tool? No, the principal would be open-market and the discount rate. So option I includes the prime rate as a principal? Or maybe not. So perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The principal tools are open-market operations and the federal funds rate. So, the question is about the principal and selective instruments. So which options include two principal and one selective?

Looking at option B: It includes open-market, discount rate, and reserve requirements. Open-market and reserve requirements are both principal. Discount rate is also a principal. So this includes all three as principal, which doesn't fit the question's description.

Option D: It includes interest rate adjustments (which is one principal, the discount rate), liquidity ratio changes (which is another principal, reserve requirements), and open-market operations. So D includes two principals and one select (open-market). That fits the description.

Wait, but option D: "Interest rate adjustments, liquidity ratio changes, and open-market operations." So, that's three. But the question asks for principal and selective. So option D includes two principal and one select (open-market).

Alternatively, looking at the options again:

Option H: Issuing new currency (which is a policy tool, not an instrument), adjusting inflation target (inflation rate, which is a principal), and open-market. So that includes one principal (inflation target as a rate) and two other policy tools.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go back to the basics. The primary instruments are open-market operations and the federal funds rate. So the question is about which two are principal and one is a selective.

Looking at the options:

Option B: includes three instruments, all of which are principal. So not correct.

Option F: includes the discount rate (principal), direct lending (which is part of open-market, so principal), and exchange rate (not an instrument). So three instruments, but only two are principal.

Option I: includes the prime rate (which is a rate, but perhaps not a principal tool—wait, principal would be open and discount rates, so I might have confused that). So if I is correct, then it includes prime rate (a rate, and perhaps considered a selective or policy tool), reserve requirements, and bond purchases. So three instruments, two principals.

Wait, but the question says the instruments of control. So perhaps option I is incorrect because the prime rate is a rate, not a principal instrument.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about each option:

Option A: Open-market, national budget, federal funds. National budget is not a control tool. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Open, discount, reserve. All three are principal. So this is incorrect because the question says two principal and one selective.

Option C: Adjust federal funds, quantitative easing, and alter tax rates. Federal funds is principal, quantitative easing is a policy tool (so it's a selective instrument), tax rates are principal. So this option includes two principals (federal funds, tax rates), and one selective (quantitative easing). That fits the question's description.

Wait, option C: Adjust federal funds rate (principal), quantitative easing (selective), and alter tax rates (principal). So yes, that would be two principals and one selective. So C is a possible correct option.

But wait, the question is about the principal and selective instruments. So perhaps the answer is option C. But I'm a bit unsure because I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, looking at option I: changes in the prime rate (a rate, perhaps not a principal), reserve requirements (principal), and bond purchases (a policy tool). So it includes two principals (reserve requirements) and one policy tool (prime rate and bond purchases). So that would fit the question.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Another approach: the Federal Reserve's primary tools are open-market operations and the federal funds rate. So the principal are those two. The other options include other instruments, which are either not principal or are selective.

Looking at option H: Issuing new currency (a policy tool, not an instrument), adjusting inflation target (a rate, so principal), and open-market (principal). So H includes two principals (inflation target as a rate and open-market) and one selective (adjusting the inflation target). But that's not correct because the inflation target isn't an instrument—it's a policy goal. So H includes two instruments but one is a policy goal (inflation target), so it's not an instrument. Therefore, H is incorrect.

Option I: changes in prime rate (selective, perhaps a policy tool), reserve requirements (principal), bond purchases (policy). So that includes two principals and one selective.

Option B includes all three as principal, which is not correct.

So option I seems to fit: two principals (reserve requirements and, perhaps, open-market?) and one selective (prime rate). Wait, no: option I is changes in the prime rate, reserve requirements, and bond purchases. So that's three instruments, two of which are principal (reserve requirements and bond purchases as policy tools?), and one is selective (prime rate is a rate, but perhaps not a principal? Or maybe it's not the best fit.)

Wait, another approach: The Federal Reserve uses the Federal funds rate as one of its primary instruments. Open-market operations is another. The question is about two principal and one selective.

Looking at option D: "Interest rate adjustments, liquidity ratio changes, and open-market operations." So, interest rate adjustments are a principal (the discount rate), liquidity ratio changes are a principal (reserve requirements), and open-market is a principal. So that option includes three principal tools, which doesn't fit the question's description because it wants two principal and one selective.

Option B includes three principal tools, so no.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because it includes two principal tools (federal funds and reserve requirements) and one selective (quantitative easing). But does C include an instrument that's not a primary? Well, quantitative easing is a selective tool, which is a bit of a misnomer because it's a broader policy tool, but it's still a selective control.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, let me think about the actual instruments. The Federal Reserve primarily uses open-market operations (buying and selling securities) and the federal funds rate. These are the primary tools. The question is about which two are principal and one is a selective.

So the options:

Looking for two principal and one selective. So the correct answer should have two principal (open and another) and one selective (maybe quantitative easing or adjusting the discount rate).

Option B: all three are principal.

Option C: two principals (federal funds, reserve requirements) and one selective (quantitative easing).

Option D: three, but including open-market and another principal.

Wait, another thought: the question is about the principal and selective instruments. The principal are the main ones, such as open-market and the federal funds rate. The selective would be tools that are somewhat related but not primary. So option C includes the federal funds (principal), quantitative easing (selective), and reserve requirements (principal). That would fit.

So the answer would be option C: Adjusting the federal funds rate, implementing quantitative easing, and altering the tax rates. Wait, no, C is about adjusting the federal funds rate, which is a principal, implementing quantitative easing (selective), and altering the tax rates (principal. So that makes two principals (federal funds, tax rates) and one selective (quantitative easing). So that fits.

But wait, let me verify. Quantitative easing is a broader policy tool, not a specific instrument, but option C includes it as a selective. So if the question is about which are the principal and selective, then option C is correct.

But I'm getting more confused. Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option I, which includes the prime rate (a rate) as a selective, reserve requirements (principal), and bond purchases (a policy). So I think option I is the correct choice.

Wait, but the question is about the principal and selective instruments. So perhaps the answer is option I, which includes the prime rate (a rate, not a principal) as a selective, but that's perhaps not the best fit.

Hold on, the question is asking for which are the principal and selective. So the principal are the main tools, the selective are additional. So the correct answer would have two principal and one selective.

Looking again:

Option B includes all three as principal, which doesn't fit.

Option C includes two principals (federal funds and tax rates) and one selective (quantitative easing). That fits.

Option I includes two principals (reserve requirements and bond purchases) and one selective (prime rate). That also fits.

But how do I decide between C and I?

Wait, the Federal Reserve uses quantitative easing as a selective instrument. So option C includes it. So the answer C is about adjusting the federal funds rate (principal), implementing quantitative easing (selective), and altering the tax rates (principal). So that's correct.

Alternatively, option I's prime rate is a rate, which isn't a principal. So option I includes two principals (reserve requirements and bond purchases) and one selective (prime rate). That is also correct.

Wait, but the question is about the principal and selective. So perhaps the best option is option I, because the other options have incorrect counts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The correct answer is I.

Wait, but looking back, the question is about the principal and selective instruments. So the correct answer would include the principal (open and another) and the selective (quantitative easing).

So option C includes two principals (federal funds and tax rates) and one selective (quantitative easing). That fits the description.

Alternatively, option I includes two principals (reserve requirements, bond purchases) and one selective (prime rate). So both options C and I fit the description.

Wait, but wait. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the options again.

The correct answer is option I: changes in the prime rate, reserve requirements, and bond purchases.

Wait, but the prime rate is a rate (so not an instrument), but the question is about which are the principal and selective. So perhaps it's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that's incorrect because it includes three instruments, all as principal.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the original question again.

The question is asking which are the principal and selective instruments. So the two principal ones are open-market and the federal funds rate. The selective is perhaps another.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the primary and the other. So the answer would be option I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, option I: changes in the prime rate (a rate, not principal), reserve requirements (principal), bond purchases (policy tool, so selective). So I has two principals (reserve requirements) and one selective (prime rate).

Thus, option I would include two principal and one selective.

But the question is about which are the principal and selective. So option I is correct because it includes two principal tools (reserve requirements and bond purchases) and one selective (prime rate). That fits the description.

Wait, but the question says "which are the principal and selective instruments of control". So the principal are the primary tools, the selective are the specific tools used in conjunction.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option C.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps option I is correct.

Wait, the correct answer is option I: changes in the prime rate, reserve requirements, and bond purchases.

So the principal would be reserve requirements and bond purchases, and the selective is prime rate.

Thus, option I has two principals and one selective.

But if the question is about the principal and selective, then option I includes two principal (reserve requirements and bond purchases) and one selective (prime rate). So option I fits.

Therefore, the correct answer is option I.
</think>

The Federal Reserve's principal instruments of control are open-market operations and the federal funds rate. The selective instruments are additional tools used in conjunction with these. Among the options provided, **option I** fits this description: changes in the prime rate (a rate, not a principal instrument) are a selective tool, while reserve requirements (a principal instrument) and bond purchases (a policy tool) are also included.
