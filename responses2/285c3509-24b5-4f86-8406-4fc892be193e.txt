Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Assume this question takes place in a "lien theory" state. A woman and her co-habiting partner share a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.

Options:

A: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.
B: No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.
C: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.
D: Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about lien theory and joint tenancy. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the scenario is that a woman and her co-habiting partner are joint tenants with the right of survivorship. He has some debts and uses his interest to get a mortgage. Then he dies, and the bank tries to execute on the mortgage. The question is whether the bank can do that under the majority view.

Hmm. I remember that joint tenancy is a legal concept where both joint owners have the right to use the property. But if one of them breaches, like by defaulting on a mortgage, then the other takes over. But if they don't, the joint tenancy continues. Wait, but in this case, the partner is the one who's in default.

So when the partner dies, the question is whether the bank can execute on the mortgage. I think that when the partner dies, the property's ownership shifts. But what about the mortgage? Does the mortgage take effect when the partner dies, or is the mortgage still on the property?

I remember something about liens and the right of survivorship. The right of survivorship allows either joint tenant to continue using the property after the other dies. But when the mortgage is taken, does the right of survivorship still apply, or does it get extinguished?

Oh wait, in a joint tenancy, if one joint tenant breaches, the other still has the right of survivorship. But if the mortgagor (the partner) dies, the mortgage lien would presumably take effect. Wait, but if the mortgage is on the property, does the mortgage's validity depend on the joint tenancy?

Wait, but the mortgage is a lien, right? So if the mortgage is on the property, the mortgage could potentially take the property away from the joint tenants. But how does that interact with the right of survivorship.

I think that in a joint tenancy, if one joint tenant breaches, the other continues. But if the mortgagor dies, the mortgage would still hold. However, when the mortgage is executed, does it affect the joint tenancy? Or does it just create a lien that the bank can use?

Wait, let's think about how mortgages work. A mortgage is a lien that's a lien on the property, but it's a lien that the property can be sold at the time of the mortgage. So, if the property is held as a joint tenancy, and a mortgage is taken, the lien could be extinguished if the mortgage is held to the contrary. But does it matter if the mortgage is on a joint tenancy?

Wait, another approach: the bank would need a title to the property to execute the mortgage. If the bank gets a deed of trust from the mortgagor, then the bank can execute. But if the bank doesn't have a deed, maybe the mortgage is valid.

Wait, but the right of survivorship says that the property should transfer to the surviving joint tenant upon the death of one of them. So if the mortgagor dies, the property should go to the partner. But if the partner is a joint tenant, would that mean the property is still hers?

But wait, if the mortgagor is a joint tenant, then the mortgage would be a lien against the property. So when the mortgagor dies, the mortgage would still be valid because the property is still owned by the partner. So the bank can execute the mortgage.

Wait, but another angle: If the mortgagor is a joint tenant, does the mortgage still take effect upon the mortgagor's death? Because the right of survivorship says the property passes to the surviving joint tenant. So the mortgagor's death would cause the property to transfer to the partner. But the mortgage is a lien on the property, so the partner could still use it.

Alternatively, if the mortgagor is the one who violates the joint tenancy, then the right of survivorship continues, and the property passes to the partner. The mortgage is a lien against the property. So the bank can execute the mortgage, but perhaps the mortgage would have to be executed upon the death of the mortgagor, but the property is still held by the partner.

Wait, but the bank would have to have a valid title to the property to execute the mortgage. So if the bank didn't get a deed of trust, maybe they don't have the title. But under the majority view, what is the usual approach?

I think that the majority view would say that when a joint tenant breaches, the other joint tenant still has the right of survivorship. So upon the mortgagor's death, the property should transfer to the partner. The mortgage is a lien on the property, so the partner can use it. So the bank can execute the mortgage because the property is still theirs.

Wait, but some sources say that when a joint tenant dies, the mortgage lien can still be effective. Because the property is still owned by the other joint tenant. So the bank can execute the mortgage.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it in terms of the chain of title.

Suppose the property is held as a joint tenancy by the woman and her partner. If the partner breaches, the woman continues. But if the woman dies, the property should go to the partner. The partner still owns the property. The partner has a mortgage ( lien ) on it. So the bank can execute the mortgage because the property is still hers. So yes, the bank can execute.

Looking at the options:

Option C says "Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien." Wait, if the joint tenancy was destroyed by the mortgage, then the property is no longer held by either of them. So the bank cannot execute because the property is no longer theirs.

Wait, that can't be. If the mortgage is on the property, and the property is still owned by the partner, then the bank can execute the mortgage. Because the property is still hers.

So if the joint tenancy was destroyed, the property isn't in the joint tenancy anymore. So the bank can't execute because it's no longer a joint tenancy. But the option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy. So that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the way the option is phrased is different. The option says, "Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien."

Wait, if the mortgage is executed, does the property transfer? Wait, the mortgage is a lien that the property can be sold on. So if the bank executes the mortgage, the property is sold. But how does that affect the joint tenancy?

Wait, the mortgage is a lien. So if a bank executes a mortgage, the property is sold. But the joint tenancy status doesn't change because the property is still owned by the partner. So the bank can execute the mortgage, but the property would transfer to the mortgagor. Wait, no, the property is still held by the partner. The mortgage is a lien against it, but the property is still theirs. So the bank can execute the mortgage.

Wait, but the bank would need title. So, if the mortgagor is a joint tenant, but the mortgage is a lien, then the mortgage is a lien against the property held by the partner. So the partner can use the property, so the bank can execute the mortgage.

Wait, but then the scenario is that the joint tenancy is broken because the mortgage is a lien. So if the bank gets a deed of trust, the property is no longer joint tenancy. But the bank can still execute the mortgage because the property is still held by the partner.

Wait, but the option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy. That can't be right because the property is still held by the partner. The joint tenancy is a separate concept. So the right of survivorship would still apply. So when the mortgagor dies, the property goes to the partner, and the bank can execute the mortgage.

Looking at the options again:

Option C says the bank got title to the property by the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The mortgage doesn't destroy the joint tenancy; it just takes the property away from the joint tenants.

Wait, perhaps the right of survivorship is the key here. So upon the mortgagor's death, the property passes to the partner. The partner still owns the property, even though the mortgage is on it. So the bank can still execute the mortgage.

So looking at the options:

Option C says: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy. No, wait. The joint tenancy was still in place. The property is still with the partner. So the bank can still execute.

Looking at the options, option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, which I don't think is correct. Option D says the mortgage was equivalent to a deed of trust, which would mean the bank gets title. But a mortgage isn't a deed of trust. So option D is wrong.

Option B says no, because the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy. But again, the joint tenancy wasn't destroyed; the property is still with the partner. So B is incorrect.

Option A says no, because the mortgage would not destroy the joint tenancy. So the property is still theirs, so the bank can execute. So A is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought the right of survivorship says that the property should transfer to the surviving tenant. So if the mortgagor dies, the property goes to the partner. So the bank can execute the mortgage.

So the correct answer would be C or A or D or something else.

Wait, let me think again. The question is: Can the bank execute?

The options are:

A: No, because the mortgage couldn't destroy the joint tenancy.

B: No, because the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, and bank needs a deed of trust.

C: Yes, the bank got title by mortgage, which destroyed joint tenancy.

D: Yes, the mortgage was equivalent to a deed of trust, so bank can.

So my analysis is that the bank can execute the mortgage because the property is still with the partner. So the joint tenancy remains. The bank can use the mortgage as a lien against the property held by the partner. So the bank can execute the mortgage, so the correct answer would be option C if the property is still in the partner's name.

Wait, but option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy. That's not correct because the joint tenancy is still in place. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, but the reasoning is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the right answer is option C, because when the mortgagor dies, the property goes to the partner, and the bank can still execute the mortgage.

Wait, but the way the option is phrased: the bank "got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage," which would mean the bank owns the property. But if the property is still with the partner, then the bank can't own it. Hmm, so maybe option C is wrong because the bank doesn't get title.

Wait, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should think about the legal principle. If a joint tenancy is broken by a mortgage, does the property's right of survivorship still apply, or does it get extinguished?

I think that the right of survivorship applies regardless of the mortgage. So if the property is still jointly owned by both, then upon the mortgagor's death, it goes to the partner. The partner has a lien against the property, so the bank can execute.

So the correct answer is that the bank can execute the mortgage, so looking at the options, which ones support this.

Option C says yes, the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, which I don't think is correct.

Option A says no because the mortgage couldn't destroy the joint tenancy.

But the bank can execute, so then it's either C or D or another option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the bank got a title from the mortgage, which would mean it could own the property, but that can't be right because it's still with the partner. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the mortgage is treated as a conveyance, so the bank could get title.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the scenario again.

The woman and her partner share the property as joint tenants. The partner has a mortgage on it. Woman is the survivor because she's the surviving joint tenant. But the partner dies, so the property should go to the woman. But the partner's mortgage is a lien on the property. So the woman can use the property, so the bank can execute the mortgage.

So the bank can execute, so the correct answer is yes.

Looking at the options:

Option C says yes, the mortgage destroyed joint tenancy, which I don't think is correct.

Option D says the mortgage was equivalent to a deed of trust, which is incorrect.

Option B says no because the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy.

So the correct answer would be option C, but wait, option C says the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, which I don't think is true. So perhaps the correct answer is option C's reasoning is wrong, but the outcome is correct.

Wait, another angle: If the mortgagor is a joint tenant, and he dies, the property passes to the other joint tenant. The mortgagor has a lien on the property. So the other joint tenant can use the property, so the bank can execute the mortgage. So the bank can indeed execute the mortgage.

Thus, the correct answer is option C only if the bank got title to the property, but since the property is still theirs, maybe the answer is option C is incorrect in reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but it's phrased wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps when the mortgagor dies, the property passes to the partner. The partner still owns the property, even though there's a mortgage against it. So the bank can execute the mortgage.

So the correct answer would be option C if it's the case that the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, which I think is not the case.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the bank can't execute the mortgage because the property is still joint tenancy, so the bank can't own it. So option C is wrong because the bank wouldn't get title.

Wait, but how can the bank get title? If the mortgagor is a joint tenant, then the bank can still own the property. So option C would be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm getting stuck. Another approach: I remember that in the case of a joint tenancy, when one joint tenant dies, the property passes to the other. But if the other joint tenant has a lien (mortgage) on the property, the lien can still be used. So the bank can still execute.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be the one that says yes, the bank can execute the mortgage.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy. No, because the joint tenancy wasn't destroyed.

Option D: Yes, the mortgage was equivalent to a deed of trust, so bank can execute. Incorrect, because a mortgage isn't a deed of trust.

Option A: No, because the mortgage couldn't destroy the joint tenancy. So the bank couldn't execute.

Option B: No, because the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy. So bank needs a deed of trust.

So none of the options say yes. Wait, the options don't include an 'yes' option. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because when the mortgagor dies, the property passes to the partner, who still holds the mortgage. So the bank can use the mortgage. But the bank doesn't get title, because the property is still with the partner.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck here. Maybe I should think about the answer as per the majority view.

In a joint tenancy, when the mortgagor dies, the property would pass to the other partner. The partner has a mortgage on it. So the bank can execute the mortgage. So the correct answer would be: Yes, because the property is still with the partner, and the bank can use the mortgage. So looking at the options, the correct one is option C if the bank can get title, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option C if the bank does get title, but I don't think the bank does. So perhaps the correct answer is option C's reasoning is wrong, but the outcome is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me read the options again.

Option C: Yes, bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed joint tenancy.

Wait, can the bank own the property if the mortgagor is a joint tenant? Because the property is still with the partner, the bank wouldn't own it. So option C is incorrect in the reasoning but correct in the outcome.

Hmm, that's a problem because if the bank can't own, then option C is wrong. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the bank can get the title because the mortgagor is a joint tenant. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the bank doesn't have title because the property is still with the partner. So option C's reasoning is wrong, but outcome is correct.

Alternatively, I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the principle.

In a joint tenancy, upon the death of one partner, the property passes to the other partner. The other partner can use the property as part of their rights, including having a lien (mortgage) against it. So the bank can still execute the mortgage.

So the correct answer is that the bank can execute, which would be option C if the bank does get title. But if the bank doesn't get title, then option C is wrong.

Wait, but in a joint tenancy, the property is still held by the partner. So the bank can't own it, because the partner still owns it. So the bank doesn't get title.

So the correct answer would be that the bank cannot execute the mortgage because the property is still held by the partner.

Looking at the options, none of them state that. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, I think I found the correct answer. The majority view would say that upon the death of a joint tenant, the property passes to the surviving joint tenant. The surviving joint tenant can use the property as part of their rights, including having a lien against it. So the bank can execute the mortgage.

So the correct answer is option C: yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy. Wait, no, because the joint tenancy isn't destroyed. So the correct answer would be option C's reasoning is wrong, but the outcome is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the options wrong. Let me check:

The options are:

A: No, because the mortgage couldn't destroy the joint tenancy.

B: No, because the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, and bank needs deed of trust.

C: Yes, bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy.

D: Yes, the mortgage was equivalent to a deed of trust, so bank can.

Hmm, so the correct answer is option C, even though in reality, the joint tenancy isn't destroyed. But perhaps the majority view is that the bank can execute. So perhaps the correct option is C, but the reasoning is incorrect, but the outcome is correct. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should just conclude that the correct answer is option C, even though the reasoning is flawed, but the outcome is correct.
</think>

In a joint tenancy, the property is held by both partners. When one partner dies, the property should pass to the surviving partner. The surviving partner can use the property as part of their rights, including having a lien against it. In this case, the partner holds a mortgage (liene) on the property. The bank can still execute the mortgage because the property is still owned by the surviving partner.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The bank can execute the mortgage because the property is still owned by the surviving partner.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The mortgage does not destroy the joint tenancy; the property remains with the surviving partner.
- **Option C**: Incorrect in reasoning. The bank does not get title to the property because the property is still owned by the surviving partner. However, the outcome is correct because the bank can still execute the mortgage.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. A mortgage is not equivalent to a deed of trust.

The correct answer is **C**, but it incorrectly asserts that the bank gets title to the property, which is not accurate. However, the outcome is correct because the bank can still execute the mortgage upon the death of the partner.

ANSWER: C
