Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is asking about the common elements between the planning models of four different authors: Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963), and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006). The options are various pairs of tasks or activities, like Evaluation and Implementation, Research and Strategy, etc.

First, I need to recall what each of these planners did. 

Starting with Hendrix. I think he's known for his work in planning models, especially in organizational and project management. His model is called the "Hendrix Model." From what I remember, it's a three-step process: Define, Measure, Evaluate. So that's Evaluation and Implementation? Wait, no, because Evaluation is part of the process, but Implementation is the third step. Wait, I'm a bit confused. But I think the key is that Evaluation is a component of his model.

Next, Kendall (1999). Kendall is another planner who, I think, developed a planning model. He's known for his work in project management too. His model is the "Kendall Model," which is similar to the hendrix model. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that Kendall's approach includes elements like defining, measuring, evaluating, and controlling. So again, Evaluation is a key part.

Merston (1963) is another name I might be mixing up. Wait, Merston is the author of the "Merston Model," which I believe is a variation of the Delphi method. The Delphi method is a forecasting technique that relies on expert opinions and iterative feedback. So Merston's model would focus on gathering expert opinions and refining them. So in terms of planning, that's Research and Strategy, because it's about gathering information and then structuring it.

Now, Parkinson and Ekachai (2006). I think they developed the "Parkinson and Ekachai Model," which I believe is a more recent approach. This model is known for combining quantitative and qualitative methods. So it's about integrating research with evaluation. That would tie into Research and Evaluation, perhaps.

Wait, but looking at the options, some of these models might have different key elements. Let me list the models and their key elements.

Hendrix Model: Evaluation and Implementation? Or Evaluation and Research? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. Hendrix's model is known as the "Hendrix Model" which includes Evaluate, Measure, and Evaluate. So Evaluation is a step, but what's the key? Maybe Evaluation and Implementation, because Evaluation is a step and Implementation comes after. Alternatively, maybe Evaluation and Research.

Wait, I think the key is that each model's key components are Evaluation and Research, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to look for which pairs are common across all models. 

Kendall's model: Let me think, I believe the key components are Research and Strategy. Because it involves gathering research and structuring strategies.

Merston's model: It's about Research and Strategy as well, because it's about gathering research and refining strategies.

Parkinson and Ekachai's model: They combine Research and Evaluation. So Research and Evaluation.

So looking for a common element. The options include things like Evaluation and Implementation, Research and Strategy, etc.

Hendrix's model has Evaluation and Research, Kendall's has Research and Strategy, Merston's has Research and Strategy, and Parkinson and Ekachai has Research and Evaluation.

Looking for elements that all four models share. The common element should be something that's present in all models.

Hendrix's Model: Evaluation and Research.

Kendall's Model: Research and Strategy.

Merston's Model: Research and Strategy.

Parkinson and Ekachai's Model: Research and Evaluation.

So, looking for what is common across all. The only element that appears in all four models is Research. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that says Research alone. Let's see the options again:

A: Evaluation and implementation  
B: Research and strategy  
C: Implementation and research  
D: Research and evaluation  
E: Strategy and evaluation  
F: Objectives and implementation  
G: Strategy and implementation  
H: Strategy and objectives  
I: Strategy and research  
J: Evaluation and objectives  

Wait, so the common elements are Research and maybe Evaluation. Wait, no. Because the models vary.

Wait, maybe the common element is Research and Evaluation. Because the models don't all have Research and Evaluation. Let me check each model's key components.

Hendrix: Evaluation and Research.

Kendall: Research and Strategy.

Merston: Research and Strategy.

Parkinson: Research and Evaluation.

So the common elements across all models:

Each model has Research, as they all do. But the other elements vary.

Looking at the options, the pair that is present in all. 

Hendrix: Evaluation and Research.

Kendall: Research and Strategy.

Merston: Research and Strategy.

Parkinson: Research and Evaluation.

So the only common element is Research. But looking at the options, none have only Research. So perhaps the other thing is Evaluation.

Alternatively, perhaps the common elements are Research and Evaluation. Because some models have Research and Evaluation, but others don't.

Wait, no. For example, Kendall's model has Research and Strategy, which doesn't include Evaluation. So the common element might be Research, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the other thing is Strategy, which Kendall and Merston have, but Hendrix and Parkinson have Evaluation.

So maybe the correct answer is that all models share Research and Evaluation. Because:

Hendrix: Evaluation and Research.

Kendall: Research and Strategy.

Merston: Research and Strategy.

Parkinson: Research and Evaluation.

So the pair Research and Evaluation is present in both Hendrix and Parkinson. But that's not a common element, because the others don't have Evaluation. So perhaps the only common thing is Research.

But looking at the options, the correct answer is D: Research and Evaluation. Wait, no. Because not all models have Evaluation. Wait, in Merston and Kendall, the models don't have Evaluation. Only Hendrix and Parkinson have Evaluation and Research, respectively.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 'Strategy and Research', but no. Because Kendall and Merston have Strategy.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that all models share Research and Evaluation. Because:

Hendrix: Evaluation and Research.

Kendall: Research and Strategy.

Merston: Research and Strategy.

Parkinson: Research and Evaluation.

So the only common elements across all models are Research and Evaluation. Because each model has Research, but Evaluation is present in Hendrix and Park. So maybe the answer is D: Research and Evaluation, but that's not present in all models. For example, Kendall and Merston don't have Evaluation.

Wait, no. Because the question says "the common elements between the planning models." So perhaps the models share elements that are present across all four.

Looking for a pair that is present in each model. Let's see:

Hendrix: Evaluation, Research.

Kendall: Research, Strategy.

Merston: Research, Strategy.

Parkinson: Research, Evaluation.

So, the only common elements across all four models are Research. But looking at the options, none have just Research. So perhaps the correct answer is that all four have Research and Evaluation. Because:

Hendrix has Evaluation and Research.

Parkinson has Research and Evaluation.

The others may not have Evaluation.

So maybe the common elements are Research and Evaluation. So the answer would be D: Research and Evaluation.

But wait, looking at the options, D is Research and Evaluation, which is present in both Hendrix and Parkinson. But the question says "the common elements" and the models don't all share Evaluation. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps all four models have Research and Evaluation. Because:

Hendrix: Evaluation and Research.

Kendall: Research and Strategy.

Merston: Research and Strategy.

Parkinson: Research and Evaluation.

Wait, so Park includes Evaluation. So the common elements would be Research and Evaluation. So the answer would be D: Research and Evaluation.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B: Research and Strategy, but that's not the case for all models. For example, Kendall and Merston have Research and Strategy, but Hendrix and Parkinson have Evaluation and Research and Evaluation. So the correct answer is D.
</think>

The planning models of Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963), and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) share common elements in their methodologies. 

- **Hendrix's Model**: Uses Evaluation and Research.
- **Kendall's Model**: Focuses on Research and Strategy.
- **Merston's Model**: Relies on Research and Strategy.
- **Parkinson and Ekachai's Model**: Combines Research and Evaluation.

The common element across all models is **Research**. However, **Evaluation** is present in Hendrix and Parkinson's models, while it is absent in Kendall and Merston's. The **correct answer**, which identifies the common elements, is **Research and Evaluation** (Option D), as both Hendrix and Parkinson's models include Evaluation, and Kendall and Merston's do not. Thus, the best fit is **Research and Evaluation**. 

ANSWER: D
