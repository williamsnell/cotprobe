Question:

Intestinal lactase deficiency leads to lactose maldigestion which subsequently can lead to lactose intolerance, i.e. causing clinical symptoms. Infants and children normally express sufficient lactase levels as not to experience clinical symptoms. Overall, adults can be classified as lactase-persisters or lactase non-persisters. What is the approximate percentage of Lactase non-persisters worldwide?


Options:

A: 30%-35%
B: 80%-85%
C: 90%-95%
D: 55%-60%
E: 5%-10%
F: 45%-50%
G: 60%-65%
H: 10%-15%
I: 20%-25%
J: 70%-75 %

Okay, so I've got this question about intestinal lactase deficiency and its impact on lactose intolerance in children and adults. I'm a bit rusty on my nutrition, but let me try to work through this.

The question asks about the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide. Non-persisters are those who don't have sufficient lactase levels to digest lactose, leading to clinical symptoms. Infants and children typically have enough lactase, so they don't have these symptoms. Adults, on the other hand, can either be lactase-persistent (still have it) or non-persistent (doesn't).

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. I remember that the general population has a certain percentage of lactase non-persistent people. I think it's something around 10-25%, but I'm not certain. Let me think more carefully.

I remember that in some regions, like the United States, the percentages vary. Oh right! In the US, the non-persistent group might be about 10-25% of the population. But wait, why are adults with lactase deficiency considered non-persistent? Because their lactase can't handle lactose, leading to symptoms. Infants and children are usually lactase-persistent because they don't get such issues.

So looking at the options provided:

A: 30-35% (might be higher)
B: 80-85% (unlikely, that's a big chunk, I think)
C: 90-95% (too high)
D:55-60% (maybe)
E:5-10% (this seems possible)
F:45-50% (a bit more than option E)
G:60-65% (again, too high)
H:10-15% (this could be correct)
I:20-25% (this is a middle number)
J:70-75% (again, higher than I think)

Wait, I think I've heard that the non-persistent adult population is around 10-25%. So that would be option E (5-10%) or I (20-25%). Let me think again. Wait, some sources might say that in the US, the prevalence is around 15-25%? Or maybe lower. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are a bit different.

Wait, another angle: lactase deficiency in adults often refers to those who are non-persistent. So how much of the global population falls into that category? I recall that in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries, the rates are higher. But I'm not sure about the exact percentages.

Wait, another thought: the options provided are about the percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide. So the answer is likely based on the global numbers. I think the majority of adults in the world are lactase-persistent, except a small percentage.

From what I recall, the global non-persistent adult population is around 10-15%, so option H (10-15%) might be correct. Or maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's lower because even a small percentage of the population has a deficiency.

Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me think: the question is about the approximate percentage. So the options are:

E: 5-10% (could be correct)
I:20-25% (could also be correct)
H:10-15% (another possibility)

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E (5-10%) or option I (20-25%). I think I remember that in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries, the percentage is higher, but I'm not sure about the global figure.

Wait, another approach: lactase deficiency in adults is considered a form of lactose intolerance. So the question is about lactase non-persisters. The percentage of the global adult population with lactose intolerance (i.e., lactase deficiency) is something I need to recall.

I think that in many regions, this percentage is around 5-15%. So option E (5-10%) and option H (10-15%) are both possible. But I'm not sure which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps a more precise approach: the World Health Organization (WHO) data or some other source. I recall that the global non-persistent adult population is approximately 10-15%. So option H would be 10-15%.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E (5-10%) if the question is about the non-persistent in the US, but the question is about worldwide. So in that case, the correct answer would be option H.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The question says, "overall, adults can be classified as lactase-persisters or lactase non-persisters." So the question is about the proportion of adults who are non-persistent.

I think the approximate global percentage is around 10-15%, so option H. So the answer would be option H (10-15%). But wait, sometimes I think that the overall number is about 15%, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to recall any specific data points.

Wait, from a quick search in my memory, I think that the majority of adults in the world are lactose-persistent, except a small percentage who have lactase deficiency. The global non-persistent adult population is about 10-15%, so option H.

The question asks for the approximate percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide, which refers to adults who lack sufficient lactase to digest lactose, leading to clinical symptoms. Infants and children are lactase-persistent, while adults can be either lactase-persistent or non-persistent. Based on global data, the percentage of adults classified as lactase non-persisters is approximately 10-15%.
