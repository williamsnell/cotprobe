Question:

What is the difference between explicit and tacit collusion?

Options:

A: Explicit collusion is an open agreement between companies on pricing, while tacit collusion implies similar pricing without any agreement.
B: Explicit collusion involves a formal contract, while tacit collusion is based on informal social interactions.
C: Explicit collusion is legal while tacit collusion is not
D: Explicit collusion happens only in international markets, while tacit collusion is confined to domestic markets.
E: Explicit collusion is based on verbal agreements, while tacit collusion relies on written contracts.
F: Explicit collusion involves price fixing, while tacit collusion involves product quality fixation
G: Explicit collusion occurs in retail markets, while tacit collusion occurs in wholesale markets.
H: Explicit collusion requires physical meetings, while tacit collusion can be done online
I: Explicit collusion is monitored by regulatory authorities, while tacit collusion goes undetected.
J: Explicit collusion is always done in secret, while tacit collusion is done openly.

Okay, so I have this question about the difference between explicit and tacit collusion. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what these terms mean, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that collusion refers to agreements between businesses that can harm competition. There are two types: explicit and tacit.

Explicit collusion sounds like it's a written agreement. Like, two companies sign a contract to price the same product at a lower cost. That makes sense because it's clear, not a hidden agreement.

Tacit collusion, on the other hand, I think is more about informal or indirect agreements. They don't involve any formal agreements. Instead, they might be based on social interactions, like word-of-mouth, or maybe just repeated discussions that aren't formal contracts. I've heard terms like "word of mouth" companies or just conversations about pricing.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Explicit is open agreement on pricing, tacit is similar but without. Wait, that's opposite of what I thought. I thought tacit was more about without any agreement. So A might be wrong.

Option B: Explicit involves formal contracts, tacit is social interactions. That aligns with what I was thinking. So B is a possible correct choice.

Option C: Legal vs not legal. I don't know if that's accurate. Maybe some cases are legal, but it's not a general rule. So C might not be correct.

Option D: Occurs in different markets. I don't think that's a defining feature. Both explicit and tacit can happen in any market.

Option E: E is about agreements and contracts. Explicit is verbal, tacit is written. That fits what I was thinking. So E is another correct choice.

Option F: Both involve fixing prices. Wait, explicit is usually price fixing. Tacit might not fix prices? Or maybe some tacit agreements could, but I'm not sure. F could be incorrect.

Option G: Retail vs wholesale. Both can have collusion, so it's not about location but type.

Option H: Explicit requires meetings, tacit can do online. I'm not sure about this. Explicit might involve face-to-face meetings, while tacit could be through other methods, maybe online, but I'm not certain.

Option I: Explicit is monitored, tacit isn't. Yes, I think that's correct. Explicit agreements are usually regulated by authorities, while tacit ones aren't.

Option J: Explicit done secretly, tacit openly. That's possible, but not a defining difference. The main thing is the method of agreement.

So looking back, the options that seem correct are B, E, I. Let me check each to be sure.

Option B: Explicit is formal, tacit is social. That's correct.

Option E: Explicit is verbal, tacit is written. Yes, that's right.

Option I: Explicit is monitored, tacit isn't. Correct.

Wait, but the question asks for the difference between the two. The options are multiple, but the question is about what's the difference, so I'm looking for the best answer that accurately describes the difference.

But the question is asking for the difference between explicit and tacit collusion. The options give various descriptions. Let me read each option's statement.

Option B says explicit is formal, tacit is social. That's correct because explicit is a contract, while tacit is social interactions.

Option E says explicit is verbal (like contracts) and tacit is written (like contracts with the company). That's correct, but maybe more specific about the nature of agreements.

Option I says explicit is monitored, tacit isn't. That's also correct, but perhaps a more general fact.

Wait, the question is about the difference in type, not the specifics of how they are formed. So maybe B is the best answer because it's a direct comparison of types. E and I are more about the methods of agreement but about the same concepts.

The question is about what is the difference. So B and E and I all are about the difference. But the question is which option correctly describes the difference.

The correct concepts are that explicit is a formal contract, tacit is informal social interactions. So B is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. Another thought: I remember that tacit collusion can involve formal contracts, but it's not always required. For example, sometimes tacit might happen without any formal contract, just through common knowledge. So perhaps the option that says explicit is formal and tacit is social (B) is more accurate.

Alternatively, option E is more about the form of agreements. For example, explicit is written (verbal), tacit is written (written contracts). So E is correct in that aspect. But B is about the nature of the agreements.

Hmm, the question is about what's the difference between the two types of collusion. Both B and E are correct in their aspects. But the question is about the difference in their nature.

Wait, looking at the options, the correct choice is B. Because that's a direct description of what explicit and tacit collusion are.

Another point: Option I says explicit is monitored, tacit isn't. That's correct because explicit agreements are usually subject to legal scrutiny, while tacit ones aren't. So I is correct, but perhaps the question is looking for the type of agreement rather than the enforcement.

The correct answer is B because it's a clear distinction between formal and social interactions.

The correct answer is **B: Explicit collusion involves a formal contract, while tacit collusion is based on informal social interactions.**

**Explanation:**
- **Explicit Collusion:** This refers to a formal agreement, often in the form of contracts, where two or more parties sign a written agreement to price or act in a certain way. It is clear and direct.
- **Tacit Collusion:** This is based on informal social interactions, word-of-mouth, or repeated discussions without formal contracts. It is less structured and more indirect.

**Other Options:**
- **A:** Incorrect. tacit collusion is not similar pricing but involves other types of agreements.
- **C:** Incorrect. While legal agreements exist, the term "tacit" implies a lack of formal contracts.
- **E:** Correct but less specific than B. While it's true that explicit is verbal and tacit is written, B provides a clearer distinction between the types of agreements.
- **F:** Incorrect. Both types of collusion can occur in the same markets.
- **G:** Incorrect. Both can occur in retail and wholesale markets.
- **H:** Incorrect. Explicit agreements can be formed through various means, not necessarily requiring physical meetings.
- **I:** Correct but less specific. While explicit agreements are monitored, tacit ones are not.
- **J:** Incorrect. Both types of collusion can occur secretly or openly.

The most accurate description is provided by **B**, as it clearly distinguishes between explicit and tacit collusion.
