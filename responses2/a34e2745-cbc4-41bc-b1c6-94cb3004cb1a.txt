Question:

Osgood is the record owner of Desertacre, a 100- acre tract of farmland in California's Coachella Valley. Osgood inherited the property from his father and farmed the land until 2006, when he reached the age of 70. He then decided to retire and move to Scottsdale, Arizona. At that time, Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler "for his use during his natural life. "After taking possession of the property, Cutler executed a mortgage on Desertacre in the amount of $100,000. In 2009, Osgood died and in his will, the testator devised Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. The will provided that Desmond and Deirdre took Desertacre "subject to Cutler's mortgage. "At the time of Osgood's death, Desertacre had a market value of $300,000. When Desmond learned of the devise, he was hesitant about taking title to Desertacre because he did not want to incur any indebtedness. Assume that Culter is still alive and in possession of the tract. With respect to the mortgage, Desmond will be

Options:

A: liable, as he will inherit the property along with any attached liabilities.
B: liable for the mortgage, because the will did not explicitly exempt him from the debt.
C: not liable, because the mortgage is Cutler's responsibility as the life tenant.
D: liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.
E: not liable, since the mortgage was not part of Osgood's original inheritance.
F: not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.
G: not liable, because the mortgage was taken out after Osgood's conveyance to Cutler.
H: liable for the mortgage, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.
I: not liable, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.
J: liable, because he is the direct descendant of the original property owner.

Okay, let's try to figure out this estate law question. Hmm, so Osgood owns a land in the Coachella Valley, and he died in 2006. He left Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with a remainder to Deirdre, I think. Wait, no, the will says Desertacre was subject to Cutler's mortgage. So the key here is the mortgage and the will's terms.

So when Osgood died, he left Desertacre to his son. But he also conveyed it to Cutler (the mortgagee) as a mortgage. So at the time Osgood died, Desertacre was subject to Cutler's mortgage. But the will itself says it was subject to the mortgage too. Wait, the way the will is phrased is that Desertacre is subject to Cutler's mortgage. So Osgood's will says that the property is subject to Cutler's mortgage, but then during his will, Cutler made the mortgage.

I'm a bit confused. So the conveyance to Cutler is a mortgage. Then the will says that the property is subject to that mortgage. So the mortgagee (Cutler) is the one who's taking the mortgage, but the will says the property is subject to it.

Wait, but the question is about what Desmond, Osgood's son, is liable for. So the options are whether he's liable for the mortgage.

I remember from the landowner's wills that if the will includes a mortgage, that's a separate entity. But if a remainder is given, that's a different thing. Also, the mortgage from Cutler is a life tenant, but that's a bit more complicated.

So, the land is subject to Cutler's mortgage when Osgood died. But the will says that the property is subject to the mortgage. So is the mortgage in effect when Osgood died, or was it taken out a long time before?

Osgood died in 2006, and Cutler took the mortgage in 2009. So the mortgage was taken out 3 years after Osgood's death. Now, when Osgood died, the property was subject to the mortgage as per the will, but was the mortgage in effect at his death?

Wait no, because the will says that the property is subject to the mortgage upon conveyance. But if the mortgage is taken out after the conveyance, does the will's terms apply then?

Wait, I think the key here is whether the mortgage is part of the conveyance. If the will includes a mortgage, that's a separate clause. The mortgagee (Cutler) is the one who's taking it out. So the mortgage is a contract, but the will says it's subject to that. So when Osgood died, the mortgage was taken out, which is cut off from the will's terms. So the will's terms (subject to the mortgage) were in effect at the time of conveyance, but the mortgage itself was created later.

Wait, but in many states, a will can include a mortgage as a part of the estate and take it out later. So the original conveyance is to Cutler (the life tenant), but the will says the property is subject to Cutler's mortgage, which would be a fee simple with the mortgage.

So when Osgood died, the property was subject to the mortgage. But at that time, the mortgage was still outstanding. However, the will says that the property is subject to the mortgage, which may affect the remainder.

Wait, the will says "Remainder to Deirdre." So Osgood's will leaves Desertacre to his son, but with a remainder to Deirdre. So the property is subject to the mortgage, which is cut out from the original conveyance.

Wait, no. Wait, the conveyance to Cutler is a mortgage. Then the will says that the property is subject to that mortgage. So the remainder is Deirdre. So the remainder is not part of the mortgage, but the property is subject to the mortgage.

So when Osgood died, the property was subject to the mortgage. But the will says that the remainder is Deirdre. So at his death, the property was subject to the mortgage, but the remainder goes to Deirdre. But when Osgood dies, he's the life tenant, but the remainder is to Deirdre, so would Deirdre inherit the property?

Wait, but the question is about the mortgage. So when Osgood died, the property was subject to the mortgage. But the will says that the property is subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage is a debt attached to the property, which is subject to the mortgage. So when Osgood died, the property's value was $300k. But the mortgage is $100k, so I think the mortgage is a note that Osgood had taken out, but the will says that the property is subject to it, so the mortgage is a part of the estate's debt.

Wait, but the original conveyance to Cutler was a mortgage, but then Osgood's will says that the property is subject to that mortgage, so that would mean that the mortgage is an interest in the estate, but the original conveyance was to Cutler as the life tenant.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think about the will. The will says "to his son, Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre." So the remainder is separate. So the remainder is Deirdre, not part of the mortgage. So when Osgood died, the property was subject to Cutler's mortgage, but the will says that the remainder goes to Deirdre. So Osgood's will leaves the property subject to a mortgage to his son, but the property's value was $300k. The question is whether the mortgage is in effect when the estate is transferred.

Wait, so Osgood's death creates his estate. At that time, the property was subject to the mortgage. But the will's terms say that the property is subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage is a fee simple with the remainder to Deirdre. So the remainder is Deirdre, and the mortgage is cut out from the original conveyance.

Wait, no. Because if the original conveyance was to Cutler (life tenant), but the will says the property is subject to the mortgage, then the mortgage is taken out by Cutler. So when Osgood died, the estate to Cutler is a mortgage, and the will says that the property is subject to that mortgage.

Wait, but the will is part of the conveyance. Hmm. So the will says Desertacre is subject to Cutler's mortgage. So at the time of conveyance, the property was subject to the mortgage. Then, when Osgood died, the property was still subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage is active.

But when Osgood died, he conveyed the land to his son. The will says that the property is subject to the mortgage. So the mortgage is still in effect when the son takes title. So the son (Desmond) is taking the property subject to the mortgage. So the question is, is the mortgage a debt that the son is liable for?

Wait, but the options are about whether he's liable for the mortgage. So let's think about whether the mortgage is a debt that the son must pay.

If the will says that the property is subject to the mortgage, that would mean that Osgood's will leaves the property subject to a mortgage. So the estate is subject to the mortgage, which is Cutler's. So when Osgood dies, he leaves it to his son, who takes title, but the property is still subject to the mortgage.

Wait, but the original conveyance was to Cutler as the life tenant. So when Osgood dies, he had the right to take over the property as his own estate, but the will says that the property is subject to the mortgage. So the remainder goes to Deirdre, but the mortgage is still a debt. So the remainder is separate from the mortgage.

Wait, no. The will leaves the property subject to the mortgage, but when Osgood dies, he has the right to take over the land. So the property is subject to the mortgage, which is cut out from the conveyance. So the mortgage is a note attached to the land; the remainder goes to Deirdre, and the mortgage remains in effect.

So when Osgood dies, the estate is still subject to the mortgage, which was taken out after his death. So the mortgage is active. Therefore, when the son takes the property, he's still under the mortgage, which is cut out after his death.

Wait, but the problem is, the will says that the property is subject to the mortgage. So Osgood's will is part of the conveyance. So the mortgage is a part of the estate. So when Osgood dies, he leaves the property subject to the mortgage, which was already taken out a long time ago. So the mortgage is still present.

Therefore, when the son takes title, he's under the mortgage. So when he takes the property, he has a mortgage which is still active. So he will be liable for the mortgage.

Wait, but wait: in some states, if a will includes a remainder, that remainder is not subject to the same debts as the estate. For example, the remainder is separate from the mortgage. So if the property is subject to the mortgage, the remainder is to Deirdre, and the mortgage is Cutler's. So when the son takes title, he's under the mortgage.

But wait, the question is about the mortgage. So Osgood's will says that the property is subject to Cutler's mortgage. So the estate is now subject to that mortgage. So the son's title is subject to the mortgage, which was taken out after his death.

So the son is under the mortgage, so he's liable. So the answer would be D: liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.

Wait, but according to the options, H says "liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage." So that's another way of phrasing it.

Yes, the mortgage is part of the will's terms. So Osgood's will leaves the property subject to Cutler's mortgage. So the estate is subject to the mortgage. So when the son takes title, he's under the mortgage. So he's liable.

So looking at the options, option H is "liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage." So that makes sense.

Alternatively, option D says the same. So both H and D are describing the same scenario. But perhaps the answer is H because the will explicitly states it as part of the devise.

Another way: the property is subject to the mortgage as per the will, which means the estate is in default. So the son is liable.

So the correct answer should be H or D. Both seem to say the same thing.

Wait, let me recheck the options.

Option H: "liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage."

Option D: "liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will."

Both are correct in their reasoning. But the wording is slightly different.

In some cases, the original conveyance is to Cutler as the life tenant. But the will says the property is subject to the mortgage, so the estate is now in default. So the will's terms are part of the will's provisions, and the estate is subject to the mortgage.

So the answer is either H or D.

But the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps the correct answer is H because the will explicitly says it's subject to the mortgage, thus the estate is in default.

But Osgood's will is part of the estate's terms. So the estate is subject to the mortgage. So the son is the devisee, so he is liable.

So the answer is either D or H.

Wait, the question is about the mortgage. So the answer is D or H.

Looking again at the options:

D: liable for the mortgage because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.

H: liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.

H is another way of saying the same thing.

So both D and H are correct. But in the options, each is a separate choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options may not have both, but perhaps the wording is different.

Wait, the options are:

A: liable as he will inherit
B: liable because will didn't exempt
C: not liable because Cutler is the life tenant
D: liable because devisee under Osgood's will
E: not liable because mortgage not part of original
F: not liable because no assumption
G: not liable because mortgage taken after conveyance
H: liable because property devised subject to the mortgage
I: not liable because didn't grant mortgage
J: liable because direct descendant

In this case, the correct answer is D or H. But let's think.

The will says the property is subject to the mortgage. So the estate is in default. So the son is liable.

So the correct answer is D or H.

But the answer options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one is the correct way to phrase it.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but the property was subject to the mortgage, and the son is the devisee. So the son is under the mortgage, so he is liable.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait. If the original conveyance was to Cutler (the life tenant), and the will says that the property is subject to the mortgage, then the estate is subject to the mortgage. So the son is the devisee and is liable.

So the answer is D.

But why is H an option? Because the estate is devised subject to the mortgage.

So perhaps the correct answer is H because the will explicitly says it's subject to the mortgage.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The key point is whether the mortgage is a part of the estate's debt. The will says that the property is subject to the mortgage. So the estate is in default. Thus, the son (Desmond) is the devisee and is liable for the mortgage.

So the correct answer is D: liable because he's the devisee under Osgood's will.

Alternatively, H is another way of stating the same thing.

Wait, but looking at the options, both D and H are correct. But in the problem, the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps one is the correct answer.

Another approach: the mortgage is a remainder. No, the will says it's subject to the mortgage, so it's a mortgage, not a remainder. So the remainder is to Deirdre.

So the son's title is subject to the mortgage, which was taken out after his death. So he is liable for the mortgage.

So the answer's D.

Yes, because the estate is subject to the mortgage, and the son is the devisee. So he's liable.

So the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether Des Kirby, Osgood's son, is liable for a mortgage under a will that leaves the property subject to it. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Facts**: Osgood inherited the property and died in 2006. He conveyed the land to Cutler as a mortgagee, with the will stipulating that the property is subject to Cutler's mortgage. Osgood's will also devised the property to his son, Des Kirby, with a remainder to Deirdre.

2. **Property and Deed Analysis**: At Osgood's death, the property was subject to the mortgage as per the will. The will explicitly states that the property is subject to the mortgage, meaning the estate is in default.

3. **Deed and Liability**: The son (Des Kirby) is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will. Since the property is subject to the mortgage, Des Kirby is liable for it.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. Des Kirby inherits the property along with any attached liabilities.
   - **B**: Incorrect. Des Kirby is not exempt from the debt because the will explicitly states the property is subject to the mortgage.
   - **C**: Incorrect. Des Kirby is not liable because the mortgage was taken out after his death.
   - **D**: Correct. Des Kirby is the devisee under Osgood's will, and the property is subject to the mortgage, making him liable.
   - **E**: Incorrect. The mortgage was not part of the original inheritance.
   - **F**: Incorrect. Des Kirby is not not liable because the mortgage is part of the will's terms.
   - **G**: Incorrect. Des Kirby is not not liable because the mortgage was taken after his death.
   - **H**: Correct. Des Kirby is liable because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.
   - **I**: Incorrect. Des Kirby is not not liable because the mortgage was not part of Osgood's will.
   - **J**: Incorrect. Des Kirby is not liable because he did not grant the mortgage.

5. **Conclusion**: Both **D** and **H** correctly describe the situation, but **D** is more concise and directly addresses the devisee status of Des Kirby.

ANSWER: D
