Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a block of wood with a density of 0.80 g/cm³. It weighs 1.0 kg, and we need to find out how much of it is above water when it's floating. The options are given as A to J, with different volumes.

Hmm, I remember that when an object floats, the weight of the object equals the weight of the displaced water. Oh wait, and the volume displaced is equal to the volume of the object that is submerged. So, the formula goes something like that.

First, let me note down the given data:

- Density of wood (ρ_wood) = 0.80 g/cm³. Wait, but units are in grams per cm³. Oh right, because 1 g/cm³ is the density of water.
- Weight of the block (m) = 1.0 kg. Wait, but kg is a large unit. I should convert it to grams to match the units for density. So, 1 kg is 1000 grams.
- We need to find the volume above water. So, first, I need to find the volume of the block and then subtract the submerged volume to get the part above.

Wait, let's think about it. The block's weight is equal to the weight of the water displaced. So, the buoyant force equals the weight of the object.

So the formula is: Weight of object = Weight of displaced water.

Weight is mass times gravity, but since we can cancel it out (g is same on both sides), we can write:

m_wood * g = m_water * g

Which simplifies to m_wood = m_water.

But since density is mass over volume, m = ρ * V.

So substituting:

ρ_wood * V_wood = ρ_water * V_submerged

Wait, but wait, the density of water is 1 g/cm³, right? Because 1g/cm³ is the density of water. So, ρ_water = 1 g/cm³.

So substituting:

0.80 g/cm³ * V_wood = 1 g/cm³ * V_submerged

So, V_submerged = (0.80 / 1) * V_wood = 0.80 * V_wood.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me write the equation again:

0.80 * V_wood = V_submerged.

Because m_wood = m_water, so 0.80 * V_wood (since m=ρ*V) equals V_submerged (since m_water = ρ_water * V_submerged, and ρ_water is 1 g/cm³, so m_water = V_submerged * 1 g/cm³ = V_submerged g/cm³).

Wait, but units are grams here. Since V_wood is in cm³, and V_submerged is in cm³, the units work out.

So, V_submerged = (0.80 g/cm³) * V_wood.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, m_wood = m_water.

m_wood = 1000 grams (since 1 kg = 1000 grams).

m_water = ρ_water * V_submerged = 1 g/cm³ * V_submerged (since 1 g/cm³ is 1 g per cm³, so V_submerged cm³ would be V_submerged grams).

So, 1000 grams = 1 g/cm³ * V_submerged.

So, V_submerged = 1000 cm³.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the density of wood is 0.80 g/cm³, then it's less dense than water, so when it floats, only a part is submerged. So the submerged volume should be less than the total volume.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the block's mass is 1 kg, which is 1000 grams.

The density of water is 1 g/cm³. So when it floats, the volume submerged (V_submerged) must satisfy:

m_wood = ρ_water * V_submerged.

So:

1000 grams = 1 g/cm³ * V_submerged.

So V_submerged = 1000 cm³.

Wait, but that's the total volume of the block? That can't be right because the block is denser, so when floating, only a part is submerged.

Wait, maybe I did the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the mass and density.

Wait, another approach: The fraction submerged is equal to the density of the object divided by the density of water.

Because, when an object floats, the fraction submerged is the ratio of their densities.

So, fraction submerged = ρ_wood / ρ_water.

So, fraction submerged is 0.80 / 1 = 0.80.

So, 80% of the block is submerged. So, the volume submerged is 0.80 * V_total.

So, V_submerged = 0.80 * V_wood.

But we also have that V_submerged = 1000 cm³ (from the earlier calculation).

So, 0.80 * V_wood = 1000 cm³.

So, V_wood = 1000 /0.80 = 1250 cm³.

Wait, but wait, that's the total volume of the block. So, the volume above water would be V_wood - V_submerged = 1250 - 1000 = 250 cm³.

Ah, that makes sense. So, the block's total volume is 1250 cm³, and 1000 cm³ is submerged, so 250 cm³ is above water.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the mass of the block is 1000 grams.

If the density of the block is 0.80 g/cm³, then the volume is mass / density, so 1000 / 0.80 = 1250 cm³. Correct.

So, 0.80 fraction submerged. So, 1250 * 0.8 = 1000 cm³ submerged.

Thus, 1250 -1000 = 250 cm³ is the volume above water.

Looking at the options, B is 250 cm³.

So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the volume of the block of wood above water when it is floating, we use the principle that the weight of the block equals the weight of the displaced water. The density of the wood is given as \( \rho_{\text{wood}} = 0.80 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \), and the weight of the block is \( m_{\text{wood}} = 1.0 \, \text{kg} = 1000 \, \text{g} \). The density of water is \( \rho_{\text{water}} = 1.0 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \).

1. **Calculate the submerged volume (\( V_{\text{submerged}} \)):**
   The mass of the block equals the mass of the displaced water:
   \[
   m_{\text{wood}} = \rho_{\text{water}} \cdot V_{\text{submerged}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   1000 \, \text{g} = 1.0 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \cdot V_{\text{submerged}}
   \]
   Solving for \( V_{\text{submerged}} \):
   \[
   V_{\text{submerged}} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **Calculate the total volume of the block:**
   The volume of the block is given by:
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = \frac{m_{\text{wood}}}{\rho_{\text{wood}}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = \frac{1000 \, \text{g}}{0.80 \, \text{g/cm}^3} = 1250 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

3. **Calculate the volume above water:**
   The volume above water is the total volume minus the submerged volume:
   \[
   V_{\text{above}} = V_{\text{total}} - V_{\text{submerged}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   V_{\text{above}} = 1250 \, \text{cm}^3 - 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 250 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

Thus, the volume of the block above the water surface is \( 250 \, \text{cm}^3 \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is **B: 250 cm³**.
