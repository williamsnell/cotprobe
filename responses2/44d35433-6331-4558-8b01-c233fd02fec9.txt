Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about gases in two bulbs connected by a valve. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the equilibrium pressure when the valve is opened and the gases allow themselves to mix. 

So the setup is a 3-liter bulb with oxygen at 195 torr, and a 2-liter bulb with nitrogen at 530 torr. They're connected and the valve is closed. Then they open, so the gases mix. I need to find the total pressure at equilibrium.

Wait, I remember that when gases mix, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures. Oh right, because pressure is force per unit area, and when you mix gases, each contributes to the total pressure. So the total pressure should be the sum of the individual partial pressures.

Oh wait, but wait. Oh, no. No, wait. Because each gas's partial pressure depends on their own volume and temperature, but after mixing, the total pressure would just be the sum of each partial pressure. Because partial pressure is (nRT)/V, and when you add the moles together, the sum of partial pressures is the same as the sum of each individual pressure.

Wait, but in the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. So each gas's contribution to the total pressure depends on how much they contribute to the volume. But when they mix, the total volume becomes 3+2 =5 liters, and the temperature is the same. So for each gas, their partial pressure is calculated using the new volume, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because initially, each gas is in a separate bulb. When they're connected, the volume of each bulb changes. For example, the oxygen bulb, which was 3 L, now has a total volume of 5 L (since the valve allows it to expand to the other bulb). Similarly, the nitrogen bulb, which was 2 L, expands to 5 L.

So each gas's partial pressure would be based on their new volume. So the oxygen's partial pressure would be (195 torr) * (3 L / 5 L) because the oxygen is now in a 5 L container. Similarly, the nitrogen's partial pressure would be (530 torr) * (2 L /5 L).

Wait, but isn't that the way to calculate partial pressures when the volume changes? Because partial pressure is proportional to the volume. So for each gas, the pressure would be (n1 RT)/V1, then when the volume changes, it's (n1 RT)/V1 * (V1_new / V1_new) ... no, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think in terms of mole fractions.

Alternatively, when the gases are mixed, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. So the total pressure is (n1 RT)/(V_total) + (n2 RT)/(V_total), where V_total is 3+2=5 L.

But wait, each gas's moles can be found from the initial conditions. Because in the initial situation, each gas is in its own bulb. For oxygen, n1 = (P1 V1)/(RT), same for nitrogen, n2 = (P2 V2)/(RT). 

So when they mix, the total moles is n1 + n2. The total pressure would be (n1 + n2) RT / V_total.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. 

n1 = (195 torr * 3 L) / (RT)
n2 = (530 torr * 2 L) / (RT)

So n_total = (195*3 + 530*2 ) / (RT) = (585 + 1060 ) / RT = 1645 / RT.

Then P_total = n_total RT / V_total = (1645/RT) * RT /5 = 1645 / 5 = 329 torr.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options. Option E is 329 torr.

Wait, but is that correct? Because another approach: the initial moles of each gas. For oxygen, n1 = (195 torr *3 L) / (RT). For nitrogen, n2 = (530 torr *2 L) / (RT). So in the combined system, the volume is 5 L, so P_total = (n1 + n2) RT /5 L.

n1+ n2 = (195*3 +530 *2 )/(RT) = (585 +1060) / RT = 1645/(RT).

So P = (1645/(RT)) * RT /5 = 1645/5 = 329 torr.

Yes, so the equilibrium pressure is 329 torr. So the correct answer would be option E.

To determine the equilibrium pressure when the two gases mix, we use the ideal gas law and the principle that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. 

Initially, the oxygen is in a 3-liter bulb at 195 torr, and the nitrogen is in a 2-liter bulb at 530 torr. When the valve is opened, the gases mix, and the total volume becomes 5 liters (3 L + 2 L). The partial pressures of each gas are recalculated based on the new total volume.

The partial pressure of each gas is proportional to its initial volume. Thus, the partial pressure of oxygen is:

\[
P_{\text{O}_2} = \frac{195 \, \text{torr} \cdot 3 \, \text{L}}{5 \, \text{L}} = 117 \, \text{torr}
\]

Similarly, the partial pressure of nitrogen is:

\[
P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{530 \, \text{torr} \cdot 2 \, \text{L}}{5 \, \text{L}} = 212 \, \text{torr}
\]

The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{O}_2} + P_{\text{N}_2} = 117 \, \text{torr} + 212 \, \text{torr} = 329 \, \text{torr}
\]

Thus, the equilibrium pressure is **329 torr**, which corresponds to option **E**.
