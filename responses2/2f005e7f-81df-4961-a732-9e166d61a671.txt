Okay, so I have this question about children's language learning abilities during their first year. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that during the latter part of their first year, children's language learning changes. The options are from A to I. I need to pick the correct answer.

First, I remember that children's language skills develop over time. In the first year, they're just starting to learn the basics. So in their first year, they probably learn the sounds and simple words. But wait, I think some children might pick up on the sounds later, like using 'go' for 'be' or 'to'. That's called phonological awareness. 

So during the latter part of the first year, they might be getting more fluent. They start to make more complex sentences. Maybe they form full sentences, which is option B. Alternatively, they might start to utter their first words systematically, which is option D.

Wait, I think systematic progression. Like, they start with the basic sounds and words, then gradually build up. So they might be systematic in their utterance. So option D says they begin to utter their first words in a systematic progression. But I also remember that some children might not process the sounds as well and could have trouble with that.

Alternatively, option B is about forming full sentences. Some children might start to form full sentences, while others might reach their language stage before they can form sentences. It's a bit tricky because in the first year, they're still learning the structure of sentences.

Another thought: in the first few months, they might use babbling, which is random sounds. So they start to make more systematic use of words, maybe. So during the latter part, they are more fluent, systematic, but not necessarily forming full sentences. Some might still be in the process of building their sentence structure.

So the correct answer might be either D or B. Let me think about what each option implies.

Option A: Systematic—maybe, but not sure. B: Form full sentences—maybe, but perhaps not as the first year is about the beginnings.

Wait, the question says "during the latter part of their first year." So that's probably after they've learned the basics but haven't yet formed full sentences. Because in the first year, they might be still using babbling, but by the end, they can start forming sentences.

Wait, but I remember that some children might begin to form complex sentences in their first year. Like, they learn the structure of sentences, even if they can't form complete sentences yet. Or maybe they start forming complete sentences but not necessarily in the same way as adults.

Alternatively, the later part might mean they're more fluent but still not yet formed complete sentences. So option B would be possible.

Wait, but I also recall that in the first year, children often form more complex sentences as they get better. So perhaps by the end of the year, they can form sentences, but maybe not yet have a full structure.

Alternatively, another option is I: become less able to perceive sounds in other languages. That doesn't seem right because the question is about learning within the same language.

Option F: being sensitive to speech patterns. That's more about speech in general, not language learning.

Option G: losing the ability to perceive sounds in other languages. That doesn't fit because the question is about language learning in the same language.

Option C: producing more language than they can comprehend. That doesn't make sense. They can't produce more than they understand.

Option E: losing the ability to understand their own language. That's more about comprehension, not language learning.

Option H: perceive sounds in multiple languages. Also not relevant here.

So, if the question is about language learning during the first year, the options are about how they're learning and not about other languages.

So, between B and D.

Wait, when I think about it, in the first few months, they start using babbling. By the end of the first year, they can start forming simple sentences, perhaps. So they begin to utter words in a systematic way, which would be option D. But they might not yet be able to form complete sentences, so option B is about forming full sentences.

Alternatively, in the first year, they might start to form more complex sentences, but perhaps not yet fully formed. So maybe option B is correct.

Wait, another thought: some children might learn to form complete sentences by the end of the first year, while others might not. But the question says "during the latter part," which could mean that they are starting to form sentences.

Alternatively, perhaps the latter part refers to the later development, like when they're more advanced. So they can form more complex sentences, perhaps using more grammatical structures.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of what each option suggests.

A: Systematic use, but I'm not sure.

B: Form full sentences. Maybe.

D: Systematic utterance.

I think the correct answer is B. Because by the end of the first year, they can start forming full sentences, especially simple ones.

Wait, but some sources say that in the first year, children can begin to use babbling sounds, and by the end of the year, they can start to form complete sentences, perhaps. So option B would be correct.

The correct answer is **B: start to form full sentences**.

During the latter part of their first year, children's language learning allows them to gradually form full sentences. While they may have difficulty with phonological awareness, by the end of the year, they can begin to articulate more complex sentences. This aligns with the idea that they systematically start using words and gradually form complete sentences.
