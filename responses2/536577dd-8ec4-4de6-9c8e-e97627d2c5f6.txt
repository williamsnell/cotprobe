Okay, so I've got this problem here about close-packed layers and finding the distance between two planes. Hmm, I remember that close-packed structures are like those with maximum packing density, right? I think they're something like hexagonal close packing or face-centered cubic.

Wait, the question says the distance between a plane through one close-packed layer and an adjacent plane through an adjacent layer. Oh, I think that's called the interplanar spacing. Oh right, in crystallography, the distance between adjacent planes is related to the lattice constants and the Miller indices.

But wait, what's the setup here? The spheres are identical, radius 0.200 nm. So each sphere has a radius of ~0.2 nm. So the diameter would be 0.4 nm. Maybe that's important.

Wait, in a close-packed structure, like in a face-centered cubic (FCC) or hexagonal close-packed (HCP), the atoms touch each other. So the distance between layers would depend on the arrangement of these atoms.

Wait, for example, in an FCC lattice, the planes are spaced by a certain distance. But wait, the problem is about a plane passing through the centers of one layer and another adjacent layer. So maybe it's like the distance between two adjacent layers in the same material.

Wait, but waitâ€”wait, maybe the question is about the distance between adjacent planes in a single layer. No, no. Because the spheres are arranged in layers, like in a crystal, each layer is a certain distance apart. So the interplanar distance is the distance between the planes.

Wait, but for a close-packed structure, the interplanar distance for adjacent layers (like in a simple cubic structure) is simply the edge length multiplied by sqrt(2)/2, but wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, in a simple cubic lattice, the distance between layers is the edge length, because each layer is separated by a single atom's distance. But in a face-centered cubic, the interplanar distance between adjacent layers is sqrt(3) times the atomic radius divided by 2. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The distance between adjacent layers in a simple cubic structure is the edge length. But in a close-packed structure, each layer is spaced by the diameter of the atoms. So for a simple cubic lattice, if each atom is at the corners, the distance between layers (along the z-axis) is a/2, where a is the edge length. Because the distance from the center of a layer to the next is a/2.

Wait, but wait in a face-centered cubic (like in a crystal structure), the layers are spaced by a/2 * sqrt(2), but that's for a different arrangement. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the unit cell. Let's say in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter is a. The distance between two adjacent layers (like the top and bottom of the unit cell) would be a. But wait, in a simple cubic, each layer is just a single atom spaced by a. So the distance between the planes would be a.

But in a face-centered cubic, the layers are spaced by a/2*sqrt(2), I think. Wait, no, wait. In an FCC structure, the interplanar distance between adjacent planes in the same layer is sqrt(2)*a/2. No, wait, no, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, wait. In an FCC structure, the interplanar distance for (100) planes is a*sqrt(2)/2. Because the planes that are adjacent in the FCC structure are separated by this distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the problem again. The spheres are arranged in close-packed layers. So each layer is a 2D arrangement of spheres. The plane in question passes through the centers of the spheres in each layer. So, for two adjacent layers, the centers are separated by the distance between the layers.

Wait, but each layer is a close-packed arrangement. So the distance between the centers of adjacent layers (like in a single layer) would be the same as the edge length of the unit cell? Or perhaps the radius plus the radius of the spheres arranged in the next layer.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say each layer is a face-centered cubic arrangement, but the layers themselves are separated by a distance equal to the distance between the centers of the layers.

In a simple cubic structure, the spacing between layers is a/2. But in a face-centered cubic, the spacing between layers (like in the same layer) is a/2 * sqrt(2)/2? Or wait, perhaps it's better to think of the interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the interplanar distance in the close-packed layers. So, if the spheres are arranged in a close-packed structure, the distance between two planes (adjacent layers) would be the edge length times something.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the distance between the layers, which in a simple cubic structure is a, but in a close-packed structure, the edge length a is related to the radius of the spheres.

Wait, for a simple cubic structure, each sphere is at a corner and the next layer is shifted, so the edge length a is equal to 2r, since the centers of adjacent layers are separated by a/2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the distance between the centers of two layers is a/2. Because in a simple cubic, each layer's position is shifted by half the edge length. So the distance between the centers is a/2.

Wait, but the spheres' radius is r. So, in a simple cubic, the distance between layers is a/2. But a is the edge length, which would be 2r, because each sphere touches its neighbor, so a = 2r.

Wait, so a = 2 * 0.2 nm = 0.4 nm.

So the distance between the centers of adjacent layers (the planes) would be a/2 = 0.2 nm. But wait, that would mean the answer is 0.2 nm, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the plane passes through the centers of one layer and another. So if the centers are separated by a/2, which is 0.2 nm, that's the distance between the planes.

Wait, but let me think again. No, wait: the distance between adjacent layers in a simple cubic structure is (edge length)/2. So if a is 0.4 nm, the spacing is 0.2 nm.

So in that case, the correct answer would be D: 0.200 nm.

Wait, but the options are:

A: 0.225 nm

B: 0.400 nm

C: 0.5657 nm

D: 0.200 nm

E: .9798 nm

F: .327 nm

G: .500 nm

H: .150 nm

I: .250 nm

J: .710 nm

So option D is 0.2, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait another thought: the spheres are arranged in close-packed layers. So each layer is a close-packed arrangement, meaning each layer is a face-centered cubic. So in that case, the distance between the planes is the height of the unit cell in the z-direction. Or perhaps the edge length.

Wait, no, wait. For a face-centered cubic structure, the unit cell edge length is 'a'. The distance between the centers of two adjacent layers (like in the same plane) would be a * sqrt(2)/2. Because I think the layers in FCC are spaced by that distance.

Wait, or maybe in FCC, the layers are spaced by a/2*(sqrt(3))/2? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the distance between two adjacent layers in a face-centered cubic structure. Let's model it.

In a face-centered cubic, each layer is a square grid with atoms at the corners and the centers of each face. The atoms are arranged in a way that each layer is offset, creating the cubic structure.

But for the purposes of plane spacing, let's think about the height of the unit cell. Wait, no, the planes in the FCC structure would be along the (100) planes, spaced by a certain distance.

Wait, maybe I should think about the interplanar spacing formula. For a cubic lattice, the interplanar spacing d is given by d = a / sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2), where a is the lattice constant, and h, k, l are the Miller indices.

Wait, but in this problem, the planes are passing through the centers of the layers. So the planes are probably in the direction of the layers. For example, if the layers are along the z-axis, the planes could be (001), but that's just the same as the lattice planes.

Wait, but perhaps the planes are in the (100) direction, i.e., over a single layer. So the interplanar spacing would be d = a / sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) = a/1 = a.

Wait, that can't be right because that's just the edge length. But earlier, I thought that for a simple cubic, d would be a/2. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify. The planes in a close-packed structure are arranged in such a way that each layer is a certain distance apart. So for a simple cubic, the layers are spaced a/2. For a face-centered cubic, the layers are spaced a/2 * sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the distance between layers in a face-centered cubic. Let's model it.

In a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, each layer's atoms are arranged in a square grid, with each layer offset by half the edge length in one direction. So the distance between the centers of two adjacent layers would be a/2, where a is the lattice constant.

Wait, no. Wait, the edge length of the unit cell is a. The atoms are arranged so that each layer is shifted by a/2 in one direction. So the distance between the centers of two adjacent layers would be a/2. Because each layer is spaced by a/2 in the direction perpendicular to the layers.

So for a simple cubic structure, layers are spaced by a/2, where a is the edge length (so the diameter is a, which is 0.4 nm). Then the spacing is 0.2 nm, which would be option D.

But wait, the question is about the distance between two planes passing through adjacent layers. So if each layer is spaced by a/2, then the distance between the planes is a/2.

But wait, in the problem, all the spheres have radius 0.2 nm. So each atom is 0.2 nm in radius, so the diameter is 0.4 nm. So for a simple cubic structure, the edge length a is 0.4 nm (since each atom touches its neighbor). So the spacing between layers is a/2 = 0.2 nm. So the answer is D: 0.200 nm.

So that's the conclusion.
</think>

To determine the distance between a plane passing through the centers of one close-packed layer of spheres and an adjacent plane passing through the centers of an adjacent layer, we analyze the structure of close-packed layers. The spheres are identical with a radius of 0.200 nm, so their diameter is 0.400 nm.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Close-Packed Structure and Layers**: Close-packed layers are typically arranged in a face-centered cubic (FCC) or simple cubic (SC) structure. In an FCC structure, each layer is offset relative to the layer below or above it, creating a periodic arrangement of atoms.

2. **Distance Between Layers**: The distance between the centers of two adjacent layers in a close-packed structure depends on the geometry of the unit cell. For a simple cubic structure, the distance between layers is \( a/2 \), where \( a \) is the edge length of the unit cell. For an FCC structure, the distance between layers is \( a \sqrt{2}/2 \), but this is less relevant here since the problem specifies that the planes pass through the centers of the layers.

3. **Edge Length of the Unit Cell**: In a simple cubic structure, the edge length \( a \) is equal to the diameter of the spheres, which is \( 0.400 \, \text{nm} \) (since the radius is \( 0.200 \, \text{nm} \)).

4. **Distance Between Planes**: The distance between the centers of two adjacent layers is \( a/2 \). Substituting \( a = 0.400 \, \text{nm} \), we find:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \frac{0.400}{2} = 0.200 \, \text{nm}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The distance between the planes is \( 0.200 \, \text{nm} \), which corresponds to option **D**.
