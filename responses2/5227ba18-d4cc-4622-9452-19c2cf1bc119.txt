Question:

Two single-user workstations are attached to the same local area network. On one of these workstations, file pages are accessed over the network from a file server; the average access time per page is 0.1 second. On the other of these workstations, file pages are accessed from a local disk; the average access time per page is 0.05 second. A particular compilation requires 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. What is the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk, if it is assumed that computation is not overlapped with file access?

Options:

A: 5/4
B: 10/5
C: 6/5
D: 5/3
E: 3/1
F: 4/3
G: 1/1
H: 7/4
I: 3/2
J: 2/1

Okay, so I've got this question about computing time on different workstations. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says there are two workstations, each with a single user. One is connected to a file server, and the other uses a local disk. The file server has pages that take 0.1 seconds each to access, while the disk is faster, taking 0.05 seconds. 

The compilation requires 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. The question is asking for the ratio of the total time when run on the diskless workstation (file server) to the workstation with the local disk. And each access is not overlapped with computation. So I need to calculate the total time for both setups and then find their ratio.

Let me break this down. 

First, the computation time is 30 seconds. Since the computations aren't overlapped with file accesses, the computation time is fixed. The file accesses would take some time depending on which workstation they're running on.

For the diskless workstation (file server), each file access takes 0.1 seconds. So 200 accesses would be 200 * 0.1 = 20 seconds. Then add the 30 seconds of computation: total time is 30 + 20 = 50 seconds.

On the other workstation with the local disk, each access takes 0.05 seconds. So 200 * 0.05 = 10 seconds. Then add the 30 seconds computation: total time is 30 + 10 = 40 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me check again. If the computation is not overlapped, then the total time is the sum of computation time and file access time. So for each setup, compute: 30 (comp) + (access time * number of accesses).

So for the diskless: 30 + (200 * 0.1) = 30 + 20 = 50 seconds.

For the disk-based: 30 + (200 * 0.05) = 30 + 10 = 40 seconds.

So the ratio is 50 : 40, which simplifies. Let's see: both are divisible by 10. So 50/40 = 5/4. Look for options, option A is 5/4. So the ratio is 5:4, so the answer should be A.

To determine the ratio of the total time required by the compilation when run on the diskless workstation to the workstation with the local disk, we calculate the total time for each setup.

1. **Diskless Workstation (File Server):**
   - File access time per page: 0.1 seconds.
   - File accesses: 200.
   - Total file access time: \(200 \times 0.1 = 20\) seconds.
   - Computation time: 30 seconds.
   - Total time: \(30 + 20 = 50\) seconds.

2. **Workstation with Local Disk:**
   - File access time per page: 0.05 seconds.
   - File accesses: 200.
   - Total file access time: \(200 \times 0.05 = 10\) seconds.
   - Computation time: 30 seconds.
   - Total time: \(30 + 10 = 40\) seconds.

3. **Ratio Calculation:**
   - Ratio of diskless workstation time to disk-based time: \(\frac{50}{40} = \frac{5}{4}\).

The ratio is \(5/4\), which corresponds to option A.

**Answer: A**
