Okay, so I've got this question about attachment theory, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question says Joe is desperately trying to get closer to Helen, and Helen is getting off. This is typical of Joe's relationships with women. The question is asking how Joe's relationship with Helen fits into attachment theory, and what Joe would be classified as.

I remember that attachment theory deals with how people form and maintain relationships, especially with women. It's all about how individuals are attached to their parents or partners, and how this attachment is built and maintained through various stages.

So, the options are:
A: detached lover
B: avoidant lover
C: disorganized lover
D: fearsome-avoidant lover
E: secure-avoidant lover
F: passionate lover
G: dismissive-avoidant lover
H: secure lover
I: obsessive lover
J: anxious-ambivalent lover

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about attachment styles again. There are different attachment styles, like secure, secure-avoidant, secure-avoidant, etc.

I remember that secure-avoidant and secure styles are similar. Secure-avoidant involves being secure but looking out for someone's safety, and then avoiding the person if they're not safe. Secure-avoidant is often described as "fearful-avoidant" or "obsessed-avoidant." Wait, no, secure-avoidant is a type of fear-avoidant.

Wait, the question says this is typical of Joe's relationships with women. So, if Joe is getting desperate, maybe he's in a secure-avoidant relationship. Let me recall: secure-avoidant is when someone is secure in their relationship but is overly concerned about leaving and avoiding the other person.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terminology. Another thought: secure-avoidant is an attachment style where the person feels secure in the relationship but is overly cautious about leaving, thus avoiding the partner.

Alternatively, I think the term "fearsome" or "fear-avoidant" is a different style. Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the types of attachment styles.

I think attachment styles have terms like secure, secure-avoidant, secure-avoidant, etc. Wait, I might be mixing up some of them. Let me try to recall:

- Secure: a person is in a secure relationship but is overly cautious about leaving, avoiding the partner. This is a type of secure-avoidant.
- Fear-avoidant: feels secure but is overly worried about leaving. Secure-avoidant is a subset of fear-avoidant where the person feels so secure that even a small fear leads to avoidance.
- Disorganized: doesn't feel secure, and the person is overly cautious about leaving. So they avoid the partner regardless of their feelings.
- Obsessive-avoidant: feels extremely concerned about leaving, even more so than someone who's just fear-avoidant. They avoid the partner to the point of feeling unappreciated.
- Anxious-ambivalent: feels anxious but also likes the relationship, so they avoid the partner when it's anxious.

Wait, but the question says Joe is desperately close, so maybe he's feeling anxious and avoiding the partner. So that would point towards anxious-ambivalent or maybe fear-avoidant.

Wait, but another thought: secure-avoidant is when the person feels secure but avoids the partner. So if Joe is in a situation where he's feeling anxious and avoiding, perhaps this fits secure-avoidant.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck. Here's what I remember: secure-avoidant is a type of fear-avoidant where the person is overly cautious about leaving because they feel secure. So they avoid the partner, perhaps because they have no real reason to leave.

So, in the scenario, Joe is desperate and gets closer. He's getting really close, so maybe he's avoiding Helen. That would fit secure-avoidant.

But wait, the options include secure-avoidant as option E, secure as option H. Wait, no, the options are:

E: secure-avoidant lover
H: secure lover

Wait, perhaps the question is about the type of attachment style, not the term.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let's think about another approach. The question is about attachment theory, so perhaps I should think about the stages of attachment.

In attachment theory, the initial stage is secure-avoidant, where the person feels secure but is overly cautious about leaving. This is the earliest stage. As the person grows older, they might transition to other stages like secure, secure-avoidant, etc.

Wait, but Joe is getting really close, so maybe he's in a secure-avoidant relationship. So the answer would be E: secure-avoidant lover.

Alternatively, another angle: the question says Joe is desperately trying to get closer. This is typical of Joe's relationships with women. So perhaps Joe is in a situation where he's emotionally stressed and trying to avoid the partner, hence this is a secure-avoidant relationship.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: some people might be in a secure-avoidant relationship, which is when they feel safe but are overly cautious about leaving. So that fits the scenario.

Alternatively, I've heard that secure-avoidant is a term, where the person feels secure but is overly cautious about leaving. So Joe, feeling desperate, might be in a secure-avoidant relationship.

So the answer would be E: secure-avoidant lover.
