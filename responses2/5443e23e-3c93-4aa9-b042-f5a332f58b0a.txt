Okay, so I've got this question about the molar absorptivity of phytochome. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think through it. 

The question says the molar absorptivity (ε) is 76,000. I remember that molar absorptivity has units of L·mol⁻¹·cm⁻¹. Oh wait, right, that's the unit. So the formula for absorbance is A = εcl, where c is concentration and l is path length.

Wait, the given values are: concentration c is 5.0 × 10^-6 mol/L, and path length l is 1.0 cm. So plugging into the formula, A = 76,000 * (5e-6) * 1.0. Let me compute that.

First, 5e-6 is 0.000005. Multiply that by 76000. Let's see, 76,000 is 7.6e4. So 0.000005 * 7.6e4 = 0.000005 * 76,000. Let me calculate that step by step.

Hmm, 5e-6 is 5e-6 = 0.000005. Multiply that by 76,000: 5e-6 *76e3 = (5*76) * (1e-6 *1e3) = 380 * 1e-3 = 0.38. Oh wait, so 0.38? But wait, let me double-check that math because sometimes exponents can be tricky.

Wait, (5e-6) is 5 * 1e-6. Multiply that by 76,000, which is 7.6e4. So 5 * 7.6 = 38. Then, 1e-6 * 1e4 = 1e-2 (since 1e-6 * 1e4 is 1e-2). So 38 * 1e-2 is 0.38. So A = 0.38.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.38. So the answer should be option H. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Oh, wait, the concentration is 5e-6 M, and ε is 76,000. So plugging into A = εc l. Yep, that seems right. 

Wait, but wait another thing. Are the units correct? The path length is in cm, yes. Molar absorptivity is L/(mol cm), which when multiplied by concentration (mol/L) and path length (cm) gives A (dimensionless). So units are correct here.

So, yeah, I think the correct answer is H, 0.38.

The molar absorptivity of phytochome is given as ε = 76,000 L·mol⁻¹·cm⁻¹. The formula for absorbance is A = εcl, where c is the concentration (5.0 × 10⁻⁶ mol/L) and l is the path length (1.0 cm). Substituting the values:

A = 76,000 × (5.0 × 10⁻⁶) × 1.0.

Breaking this down:
- 5.0 × 10⁻⁶ = 0.000005.
- 76,000 = 7.6 × 10⁴.

Multiplying these together:
A = (7.6 × 10⁴) × (0.000005) = 0.38.

Thus, the absorbance is 0.38. Among the options provided, this corresponds to **option H (0.38)**.

ANSWER: H
