Question:

How does the price mechanism act to conservethose productsand resources which are most scarce?

Options:

A: The price mechanism guarantees an equal distribution of scarce resources among consumers.
B: The price mechanism ensures that scarce resources are only used by the government.
C: The price mechanism has no effect on the conservation of scarce resources.
D: The price mechanism leads to a rapid depletion of scarce resources due to increased demand.
E: The price mechanism caps the price of scarce resources to make them affordable.
F: The price mechanism reduces the production of scarce resources.
G: The price mechanism discourages consumers from buying scarce resources.
H: The price mechanism allocates scarce resources to the highest bidders, regardless of the conservation status.
I: The price mechanism induces consumers to search for substitutes, an act which will tend to conserve the scarce resource.
J: The price mechanism encourages overuse of scarce resources.

Alright, so I've got this question about the price mechanism and how it conserves scarce resources. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that the price mechanism is part of the supply and demand model. Let me think through this.

The question asks how the price mechanism ensures conservation. So the options are A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall what the price mechanism does. It's about allocating resources based on their scarcity. So when resources are scarce, their prices are high, and people are willing to pay more for them. This should encourage the use of those resources because the prices are higher.

Wait, but why does that lead to conservation? Well, if resources are expensive, people might not want to use them unless they have alternatives. So if a resource is scarce, its price goes up, making it less attractive to use directly. But maybe they can't use it directly, so they look for substitutes. That substitution would tend to conserve the resource because they can't use it as much.

Let me look at the options. Option I says the price mechanism induces consumers to search for substitutes, which would conserve the scarce resource. That sounds right because when prices are high, consumers might find other options that are more suitable.

Option E mentions capping prices to make them affordable. I don't think that's correct. Capping would limit availability, not encourage substitution. So E is probably wrong.

Option F says it reduces production. No, that doesn't make sense. Price mechanisms usually encourage more production when resources are cheap. So F doesn't fit.

Option A talks about equal distribution. That's the equilibrium in supply and demand. It's not about conservation but about how resources are distributed.

Option B is about government, which isn't related to the price mechanism.

Option C says it has no effect. No, that's not right because the price system helps conserve.

Option D says it leads to rapid depletion. No, I think more demand would lead to using up the resource, not depleting.

Option E is about capping, which I think is wrong.

Option G suggests discouraging consumers from buying. No, high prices should make consumers more willing to buy, not less.

Option H says allocate to highest bidders. That's part of the price mechanism, but it doesn't directly prevent conservation.

Option J says encourage overuse. No, overuse would be due to scarcity, but that's more about the lack of alternatives.

So the correct answer should be I. Because when resources are scarce, their prices rise, which makes consumers search for substitutes. That substitution helps conserve the resource because they can't use the high-priced alternatives as much.

The correct answer is:

**I: The price mechanism induces consumers to search for substitutes, an act which will tend to conserve the scarce resource.**

**Explanation:**
The price mechanism works by allocating resources based on their scarcity. When resources are scarce, their prices rise, making them less attractive to use directly. Consumers are more likely to seek substitutes that can fulfill their needs at a lower cost. This substitution behavior tends to conserve the scarce resource, encouraging its use in alternative forms.
