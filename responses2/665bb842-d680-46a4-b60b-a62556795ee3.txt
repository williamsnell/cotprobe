Okay, so I've got this medical question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is about.

The patient is a 19-year-old male who presented after being hit from behind below the right knee while playing football. His gait analysis shows a lack of fluid motion. Standing flexion test is negative. The cruciate and collateral ligaments are intact. Foot drop on the right is noted. So, what's the diagnosis here?

First, I'll break down the key points. The patient is male, so some options might be more likely. He's hit from behind, which makes me think about the muscles around the knee. Gait analysis shows no fluid motion—so maybe the hip movement isn't normal. The Standing Flexion test is negative, which could mean he's not flexing the knee properly. Crucial and collateral ligaments are intact, so ligament tears might not be the cause here.

Foot drop on the right—so the right lower leg is dropping, which suggests some instability in the lower limb, maybe a patella or foot problem. Let me think about the options.

Option A: Meniscal tear. Menisci are around the knee, supporting the ligaments. If there's a tear, the ligaments might loosen, affecting movement. But the question mentions that cruciated and collateral ligaments are intact, so maybe not.

Option B: Tibial stress fracture. That's when the tibial nerve or fibula breaks, causing pain and inability to walk. But the patient is in a gait analysis with fluid motion issues, and his test was negative. Also, he has a foot drop, which indicates a soft tissue problem, not a nerve injury. So probably not B.

Option C: Posterior cruciate ligament tear. That's a ligament tear in the right side of the knee. It would cause pain and maybe a drop in motion, especially if the ligament is on the outside. But the question says the cruciated ligaments are intact, so this might not be it. Plus, the foot drop is on the right, which could be a problem elsewhere.

Option D: Unilateral sacral shear. Sacral shear is when the sacrum is sheared inward or outward, causing issues in the lower leg. But I'm not sure if the foot drop and fluid motion would point to this. The sacral issue might affect the hip, but the question says he's hit from behind, so maybe the sacrum isn't the issue here. Plus, the presence of a sacral shear might affect the hip, but the question doesn't mention anything about the hip, so maybe this is less likely.

Option E: Patellar dislocation. That's when the patella (shin leg) is broken, causing drop in motion and pain. The patient has a foot drop, which fits. But does it fit the other points? The Standing Flexion test is negative, which suggests the knee isn't flexing properly. If the patella is broken, maybe the knee wouldn't flex as much because the plantar fascia is compromised. Also, the cruciated ligaments are intact, so I'm not sure. If the patellar ligaments were broken, the cruciated ligaments might have been intact. So this seems possible.

Option F: Medial collateral ligament sprain. That's a tear of the medial collateral ligament, which is in the medial side of the knee. The patient has a foot drop, but the collateral ligaments are intact. So maybe not F.

Option G: Posteriorly deviated fibular head. This is about the fibula being pulled outward, causing issues like patellar drop and knee pain. The patient's gait shows fluid motion issues and foot drop, so maybe this is a possibility. But I'm not sure how it would affect the cruciated and collateral ligaments.

Option H: Anterior cruciate ligament tear. This is a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, which is around the front of the knee. It's associated with issues like knee pain, instability. The patient has a fluid motion issue and foot drop. So if the anterior ligament is torn, the knee might not flex properly, leading to fluid motion. But the cruciated ligaments are intact, so maybe that's not the issue.

Option I: Plantar flexed cuboid. That's a condition where the cuboid (the bottom of the foot) is pulled forward, causing drop in motion. The patient has a foot drop, so maybe I. But does it affect fluid motion? If the cuboid is pulled, it might cause issues with the plantar fascia, but I'm not sure if that's the most likely here.

Option J: Anteriorly deviated distal femur. That's about the femur's distal end deviating forward, causing hip issues. But the patient is hit from behind, which would affect the pelvis and lower leg more, not the hip. So J seems unlikely.

So considering all the options, the patient's symptoms point to a patellar dislocation. The foot drop and the lack of fluid motion align with that. The cruciated and collateral ligaments are intact, which supports a soft tissue problem rather than a ligament tear. Sacral shear is less likely because the issue is with the leg, not the hip. Also, the presence of the foot drop suggests a patella-related injury.

Wait, another thought: Could it be a patellar dislocation? Yes, because that's a common injury where the patella breaks, causing drop in motion. The presence of foot drop and the lack of fluid motion align with that. The cruciated and collateral ligaments being intact suggests that the ligaments around the knee are still functioning, which is more typical of a patellar injury than a ligament tear. So I think E is the answer.

The patient is a 19-year-old male presenting after being hit from behind below the right knee while playing football. Key findings include a lack of fluid motion, a negative standing flexion test, and intact cruciated and collateral ligaments. The foot drop on the right suggests a patellar issue, as a patella dislocation typically causes such pain and movement limitations.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A: Meniscal tear** – Unlikely, as the question specifies intact cruciated and collateral ligaments.
- **B: Tibial stress fracture** – Unlikely due to the gait analysis results (lack of fluid motion) and the presence of a foot drop.
- **C: Posterior cruciate ligament tear** – Unlikely because the cruciated ligaments are intact.
- **D: Unilateral sacral shear** – Unlikely given the pain and movement issues, which point to a leg-related injury.
- **E: Patellar dislocation** – Most likely, as it explains the foot drop and fluid motion, and the intact cruciated and collateral ligaments.
- **F: Medial collateral ligament sprain** – Unlikely, as the collateral ligaments are intact.
- **G: Posteriorly deviated fibular head** – Unlikely due to the patient's symptoms and the intact cruciated ligaments.
- **H: Anterior cruciate ligament tear** – Unlikely because the cruciated ligaments are intact.
- **I: Plantar flexed cuboid** – Unlikely, as the issue is with the leg, not the hip.
- **J: Anteriorly deviated distal femur** – Unlikely due to the issue affecting the lower leg, not the hip.

The most likely diagnosis is **patellar dislocation**.

**Answer: E**
