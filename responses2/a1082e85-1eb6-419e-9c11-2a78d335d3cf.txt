Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the entropy change of the surroundings. Hmm, let me think. Alright, I remember that enthalpy and entropy are related through the equation for Gibbs free energy or maybe using the Clapeyron equation, but wait, I'm trying to find the entropy change of the surroundings. 

Wait, the problem says the enthalpy of vaporization of chloroform is 29.4 kJ/mol. And the normal boiling point is 334.88 K. Oh right, the enthalpy of vaporization is the heat required to vaporize a liquid at its boiling point under standard conditions.

So, the first step is probably to calculate the entropy change of the system, which is the enthalpy change divided by the temperature. Since it's vaporization, it's a phase change from liquid to gas. So, the change in enthalpy (ΔH) is positive for vaporization, and the temperature is the boiling point.

So, ΔH is 29.4 kJ/mol. I need to convert that into J because the answer options are in J. So, 29.4 kJ is 29400 J. The temperature is 334.88 K. So, the entropy change of the system (ΔS_system) is ΔH divided by T. So, 29400 J / 334.88 K.

Let me calculate that. 29400 divided by 334.88. Let me see: 334.88 is approximately 335. So, 29400 / 335 is about 87.55 J/(mol·K). Wait, but wait, chloroform's enthalpy is positive, so the system is gaining entropy. So, the system's entropy change is positive, and the surroundings' will be negative, because entropy is a measure of disorder. 

But wait, the question is about the entropy change of the surroundings. So, to find that, I need to calculate ΔS_surroundings using the formula: q_rev / T. But wait, in this case, the heat is being transferred at constant pressure, so it's a phase change at constant pressure. So, the heat absorbed by the system (chloroform) is the enthalpy of vaporization. So, q is positive for the system, so the surroundings are losing that heat, so their entropy change would be negative.

Wait, but the formula for surroundings' entropy change is ΔS_surroundings = q_rev / T, but I have to be careful about the sign. Since the surroundings lose heat, their entropy change is negative. So, it's -q_surroundings / T. But q_surroundings is the negative of q_system, because q_surroundings = -q_system for a process in which the system is doing work on the surroundings. Wait, but in vaporization, the system is absorbing heat (q_system positive), so the surroundings are losing that. So, q_surroundings is negative. So, ΔS_surroundings = (-q_system) / T.

But wait, another approach: Since the process is at constant pressure, the heat at the boiling point is equal to the enthalpy change. So q is 29.4 kJ (positive for the system). So, the surroundings lose that heat, so the heat transfer is -29.4 kJ. So, the entropy change of surroundings is q_surroundings / T = (-29400 J) / 334.88 K. 

Let me compute that. So, -29400 / 334.88. Let me calculate that. 334.88 is about 335, so 29400 / 335 is approximately 87.55. But since it's negative, it's about -87.55 J/(mol·K). 

Looking at the options, option C is -87.8 J/(mol·K). So, that seems to match. Wait, but I should double-check. Let me compute it more accurately. Let me calculate 29400 divided by 334.88 exactly. 

334.88 * 87.55 = let's calculate: 334.88 * 80 is 26790.4; 334.88 *7.55 = 334.88 *7 = 2344.16; 334.88 *0.55=184.184. So 2344.16 + 184.184 = 2528.344. 26790.4 +2528.344= 29318.744. Hmm, but 29400 is a bit higher. So 29400-29318.744=81.256. So, 81.256 / 334.88 ≈ 0.2427. So total is 87.55 +0.2427≈87.7927. So about 87.79 J/(mol·K). But wait, since we're dividing 29400 by 334.88, let me compute it more precisely. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 29400 / 334.88. Let's do it step by step. 

334.88 * 87 = 334.88 *80=26790.4; 334.88 *7=2344.16. So 26790.4 +2344.16=29134.56. 

So 87 gives 29134.56. The actual numerator is 29400, so 29400-29134.56=265.44. 

Now, 334.88 * x =265.44. 

x=265.44 / 334.88 ≈ 0.7927. So, total x is 87.7927 J/(mol·K) ≈ 87.79 J/(mol·K). 

Wait, but 29400 divided by 334.88 is 87.79 J/(mol·K). So, the entropy change of the system is positive because the system's entropy increases. But the surroundings' entropy change is negative, which would be -87.79 J/(mol·K). 

Looking at the options, the closest one is option C: -87.8 J/(mol·K). So that's the answer.

To calculate the entropy change of the surroundings, we start by determining the entropy change of the system (chloroform vaporization). The enthalpy of vaporization of chloroform is given as \( \Delta H = 29.4 \, \text{kJ/mol} \), which is equivalent to \( 29400 \, \text{J/mol} \). The normal boiling point of chloroform is \( 334.88 \, \text{K} \). The entropy change of the system is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = \frac{\Delta H}{T}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = \frac{29400 \, \text{J/mol}}{334.88 \, \text{K}} \approx 87.79 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

Since the entropy change of the system is positive, the surroundings will experience a negative entropy change. The surroundings lose heat during the phase change, so the entropy change of the surroundings is:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = -\frac{\Delta H}{T}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = -\frac{29400 \, \text{J/mol}}{334.88 \, \text{K}} \approx -87.79 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}
\]

The closest option to this value is \( -87.8 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), which corresponds to option C.
