Okay, so I've got this problem about polystyrene and the angles of incidence and transmission. Hmm, okay, I remember that when light goes from one medium to another, the speed of the wave changes, which affects the angles. Oh right, Snell's Law! But wait, the question is a bit more complicated. It says to calculate the angle transmitted when polystyrene and air are swapped. So what's the plan here?

First, I need to recall Snell's Law. Snell's Law is n1 sinθ1 = n2 sinθ2, where n is the refractive index and θ is the angle. Oh wait, but wait, in this case, the light is going from air to polystyrene, and then from polystyrene to air again. Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says: when a wave is incident at θ_i=30° from air onto polystyrene, calculate θ_t. Then, swap polystyrene and air and repeat.

So the first part is air to polystyrene. The second part is polystyrene to air. So I'll have to calculate both angles.

The relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of polystyrene is given as 2.7. I think the refractive index n is approximately equal to the square root of the relative permittivity ε, but wait, that's only for materials where the refractive index is close to sqrt(ε_r). But wait, wait. Wait, the refractive index n and the relative permittivity εr are related by n = sqrt(εr) when the material is non-magnetic. So for polystyrene, which is a metal? Or is it non-magnetic? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, polystyrene is a polymer, non-magnetic, so n is sqrt(2.7).

Wait, wait, let's double-check. Polystyrene has a relative permittivity of about 2.7. So n = sqrt(2.7) ≈ 1.643. Or wait, wait a second. Wait, no, the refractive index is sometimes given as sqrt(εr) when the material is non-magnetic. So yes, n ≈ sqrt(2.7) ≈ 1.643.

So the first part: air to polystyrene.

Snell's Law: n1 sinθ1 = n2 sinθ2.

Air has n1 = 1.0.

θ_i is 30 degrees.

So n1 * sin(30) = n2 * sin(θ_t).

Plugging in numbers:

1 * sin(30) = 1.643 * sin(θ_t).

Sin 30 is 0.5, so 0.5 = 1.643 * sinθ_t.

So sinθ_t = 0.5 / 1.643 ≈ 0.304.

θ_t ≈ arcsin(0.304) ≈ 17.7 degrees.

Wait, wait, but this is the first part: when light goes from air (n=1) to polystyrene (n≈1.643), the transmitted angle is θ_t ≈17.7 degrees.

Now, the second part: swapping. So the light goes from polystyrene (n=1.643) to air (n=1).

Again, using Snell's Law: n2 sinθ_i = n1 sinθ_t.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the angle direction. Wait, when going from a medium with higher refractive index to lower, the angle of incidence is greater than the transmitted angle.

So in the first case, when the light is going from air (n=1) to polystyrene (n=1.643), the transmitted angle is smaller than the incident angle. That makes sense.

But in the second case, when the light is going from polystyrene (n=1.643) to air (n=1), which is lower, so the angle of incidence (θ_i) would be greater than the transmitted angle (θ_t).

Wait, wait, but the initial calculation is for θ_i=30° from air to polystyrene. Now, when swapping, the incident angle is from polystyrene to air. So what's the initial angle in this swapped scenario?

Wait, the question says: "calculate the angle if transmission θ_tInterchange polystyrene and air and repeat the calculation." Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking, what is the angle when polystyrene and air are swapped, i.e., when the light goes from polystyrene (n=1.643) to air (n=1). So the incident angle is 30 degrees again.

Wait, but the initial part was from air to polystyrene. So when swapping, the incident angle θ_i is still 30 degrees, but the medium changes.

Wait, but I think I need to recalculate θ_t in both cases. So first part for air to polystyrene: θ_i=30°, n1=1, n2=1.643.

Second part: polystyrene to air, θ_i=30°, n1=1.643, n2=1.

Wait, but wait, the first part: when light is going from air (n=1) to polystyrene (n=1.643), the transmitted angle is θ_t, which is about 17.7°, as I calculated.

Now the second part: when light is going from polystyrene (n=1.643) to air (n=1), the incident angle is 30 degrees. So Snell's law is:

n1 sinθ_i = n2 sinθ_t.

Wait, no, wait, that's the same as before, but with n1 and n2 swapped. So:

n2 = 1.0 (air), n1 = 1.643 (polystyrene).

So 1.643 * sin(30) = 1.0 * sinθ_t.

So sinθ_t = (1.643 * 0.5) = 0.8215.

θ_t = arcsin(0.8215) ≈ 55.0 degrees.

Wait, that can't be right, because when the incident medium is denser, the transmitted angle should be larger than the incident. Wait, but in this case, the incident medium is polystyrene (n=1.643), which is denser than air (n=1), so the transmitted angle should be larger than the incident angle. So 30 degrees incident, and the transmitted angle is about 55 degrees. That makes sense.

Wait, but that's the opposite of the first part, where the transmitted angle was smaller. So in the first case, when going from air (n=1) to a higher n medium, the transmitted angle is smaller. In the second case, when going from a higher n medium to lower, the transmitted angle is larger.

So the angles θ_t when swapping would be 17.7 and 55 degrees. Looking at the options, option F is 17.7 and 55.2. Oh, that's very close. So option F: 17.7 and 55.2.

Wait, but wait, the question says to calculate θ_t when polystyrene and air are swapped. So perhaps the angles would be 17.7 and 55.2. That's option F.

Wait, but the first part was θ_i=30°, so the first angle is 17.7°, and the second angle is 55.2°, so option F.

To solve the problem, we use Snell's Law, which relates the angles of incidence and transmission and the refractive indices of two media. Snell's Law is given by:

\[
n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2
\]

### Case 1: Air to Polystyrene
- Air has \(n_1 = 1.0\), and polystyrene has a relative permittivity \(\epsilon_r = 2.7\), so its refractive index \(n_2 = \sqrt{\epsilon_r} \approx 1.643\).
- The incident angle \(\theta_i = 30^\circ\).
- Using Snell's Law:
  \[
  1.0 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 1.643 \cdot \sin(\theta_t)
  \]
  \[
  0.5 = 1.643 \cdot \sin(\theta_t)
  \]
  \[
  \sin(\theta_t) = \frac{0.5}{1.643} \approx 0.304
  \]
  \[
  \theta_t \approx \arcsin(0.304) \approx 17.7^\circ
  \]

### Case 2: Polystyrene to Air
- Polystyrene now acts as the incident medium (\(n_1 = 1.643\)), and air (\(n_2 = 1.0\)) is the transmitted medium.
- The incident angle remains \(\theta_i = 30^\circ\).
- Using Snell's Law:
  \[
  1.643 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 1.0 \cdot \sin(\theta_t)
  \]
  \[
  1.643 \cdot 0.5 = \sin(\theta_t)
  \]
  \[
  \sin(\theta_t) \approx 0.8215
  \]
  \[
  \theta_t \approx \arcsin(0.8215) \approx 55.0^\circ
  \]

### Final Answer
When polystyrene and air are swapped, the transmitted angles are approximately \(17.7^\circ\) and \(55.0^\circ\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**E: 15 degrees and 50 degrees**
