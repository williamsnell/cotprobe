Okay, so I've got this law question here about murder and the presumption of malice. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The scenario is a defendant who was on the first day of her new secretarial job. Her boss told her she'd be fired in a week if she didn't go out with him. Every day during the week, the boss pressure her, and she refused. Then, when the boss came back the next day, he tried to press her again. She knocked him unconscious with a stapler and choked him to death. So, the defendant is tried for murder. But she challenges the charge on the grounds of the state's statute, which says that when killing another, malice is presumed. The question is whether she'll win the appeal.

Hmm, I remember that the state's statute is about the presumption of malice. The idea is that when a defendant is found guilty of murder, they can counter by arguing that the killing was not intentional. The state's statute says that malice is presumed, so the burden is on the defendant to show malice didn't exist.

Wait, so in this case, the defendant did commit murder. She's being tried and challenges the conviction. The state's statute is that she's allowed to use the presumption of malice. So, if her action is premeditated, does that negate malice?

Wait, malice is a specific intent to kill someone with a purpose beyond just a negligent act. So, if the defendant acted in self-defense, does that negate malice? Or is it about the intent to kill, not necessarily self-defense.

In the scenario, the defendant was completely uncooperative. She refused every day. But during the press conference, she got a stapler and died. That's a very violent act. She might have felt she was being mistreated, but she argued that it was her own action.

So, under the state's statute, the burden is on her to show malice was not present. If she can show malice, she can avoid paying the full sentence. But if she can't show malice, her conviction stands, and she has to prove malice existed.

Wait, but the state says the presumption is there. So, the defendant's case is whether the statute applies. If the statute says malice is presumed, and she argues that malice didn't exist, but the statute doesn't prevent that, then she can't show malice. That would result in a winning conviction unless she can prove malice.

But wait, the statute's purpose is to prevent the killing from being actionable as murder if malice is not shown. So, if she can prove malice, the burden is on her to prove malice didn't exist, which she hasn't.

So, in the case of murder, if the defendant is found to have acted with malice, they get the sentence. If they don't have malice, the state's statute says the burden is on them to show malice didn't exist. So they must prove malice wasn't present.

In this case, the statute says that if they don't show malice, they can't be convicted of murder. But the defendant feels like she did act in self-defense, so she's arguing that malice didn't exist.

Wait, but the statute is about the burden being on them to prove malice didn't exist. So, if she can't prove malice, she loses. But does she have sufficient evidence?

In the scenario, the defendant acted in self-defense. That's a clear self-defense claim. Self-defense is a defense, not malice. So, if she has a valid self-defense claim, she doesn't need to prove malice. She can just say she was in self-defense, which is a defense, not malice.

Wait, but the state's statute is about malice. So, the defendant's case is whether the statute applies. If the statute says malice is presumed, and she argues malice isn't present, but the statute doesn't prevent that. So, she can't show malice, so the conviction would stand.

Wait, no, the statute says that if malice wasn't present, the burden is on them to show that it didn't exist. So, if she can't show malice, the case goes to the jury, which would find malice, leading to murder. So, she can't escape the statute unless there's a showing that malice indeed existed.

But the scenario shows she acted in self-defense, which is not malice. So, she doesn't have malice, so the statute's burden isn't met. Therefore, she can't prove malice didn't exist, so she can't avoid the murder charge.

Wait, but the options are about the outcome of the appeal. Let me think again.

If the statute says malice is presumed, then the burden is on the defendant to prove that malice didn't exist. If she can't do that, then she loses. In this case, she has no malice, so she can't show malice didn't exist. So, she can't avoid the murder. Therefore, the statute doesn't affect her. She can't win on appeal if she can't show malice.

So, the answer would be that she loses because the statute doesn't prevent her from proving malice didn't exist. Wait, but no, the statute says the burden is on her to show malice didn't exist. So, if she can't show malice, she can't avoid it. So, she loses.

Looking at the options:

A: lose because the presumption may be rebutted â€” Well, if the state's statute says malice is presumed, then maybe the burden is on her to show malice didn't exist. If she can't do that, she loses. So, this option says she loses because the presumption may be rebutted. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the state's statute is that malice is presumed, so the burden is on her to show that malice didn't exist. If she can't, she loses. So, the state's statute doesn't prevent that. So, she can't avoid the murder charge, so she loses.

So, the options:

Option A: lose because the presumption may be rebutted. The state says the burden is on her to show malice didn't exist. If she can't, she loses. So, she loses because the burden is on her to prove malice didn't exist, which she can't. So, the state's statute doesn't help her. So, she loses.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says she loses because the presumption may be rebutted. That seems a bit different. The state's statute says that the burden is on her to show malice was not there. So, if she can't show that, she can't escape the murder charge. So, she loses.

The answer options:

Looking again, the options: 

A: lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.

I think the confusion arises between the state's statute and the actual malice. The state's statute imposes that malice is presumed, so the burden is on the defendant to prove malice didn't exist. If she can't, she loses.

So, in this case, she's trying to prove malice didn't exist, but the state's statute doesn't prevent that. So, she can't avoid the killing. Therefore, the state's statute doesn't affect her. So, she can't win on appeal.

Wait, but the options are about the outcome. So, the answer would be that she loses because the state's statute doesn't prevent malice. So, looking at the options, option A says she loses because the presumption may be rebutted. Or option D says she wins because she acted in self-defense.

Wait, no. Option D says she wins because she acted in self-defense. But self-defense isn't malice. Her argument is that malice didn't exist, but the statute says the burden is on her to prove malice didn't exist. So, she can't show malice, so she loses.

Wait, but the scenario shows she was in self-defense, which is a defense, not malice. So, she can't use malice as a defense here. So, she can't show malice, so she loses.

Looking at the options, option D says she wins because she acted in self-defense. But that's not about malice. So, that's incorrect.

Wait, another angle: the state's statute says that malice is presumed, so the defendant must show malice didn't exist. If she can't, the murder charge stands. So, she loses.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: lose because the presumption may be rebutted. So, the state says the burden is on her to show malice didn't exist. If she can't, she loses. So, the answer would be she loses because the burden is on her to show malice didn't exist, but she can't, so she loses.

But the options don't directly state that. Looking at the options:

A: lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.

D: win, because she acted in self-defense.

Hmm, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

The scenario: She tried murder, but her defense is that she acted in self-defense. So, the question is whether she can win the appeal.

Under the state's statute, if she can show malice didn't exist, she can't be convicted. But if she can't, the statute doesn't help, so she loses.

In the case of murder, the defendant can be convicted unless the state's statute says that malice was presumed. If she can show malice didn't exist, the burden shifts to the jury. But if she can't show malice, the statute's burden is on her to show malice didn't exist, which she can't. So, she can't escape the murder charge.

So, the state's statute doesn't help her. So, she loses on appeal.

Looking at the options: Option A says she loses because the presumption may be rebutted. That seems to suggest that the state's statute allows the burden to be on her to show malice didn't exist. So, if she can't do that, she loses.

Wait, but the options are about what happens. So, if the state's statute says that malice is presumed, then the burden is on her to show malice didn't exist. So, if she can't prove malice didn't exist, the statute's burden isn't met. Therefore, she can't avoid the murder charge, so the state doesn't win. So, she loses.

In that case, the answer is she loses because the burden is on her to prove malice didn't exist. But none of the options directly say that. The closest is option A. Option A says she loses because the presumption may be rebutted. So, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the state's statute doesn't affect the case because the statute presumes malice, but the underlying fact is self-defense. 

Wait, self-defense is not malice, so the defendant didn't have malice. Therefore, if the state's statute says malice is presumed, the burden is on her to prove malice didn't exist. Since she can't, she loses.

So, the correct answer would be that she loses because the state's statute prevents her from proving malice didn't exist. But looking at the options, option A says she loses because the presumption may be rebutted. Or, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the state's statute doesn't prevent her from proving malice didn't exist, so she loses. 

Wait, the state's statute says the burden is on her to show malice didn't exist. If she can't, she loses. So, she can't show malice, so the statute doesn't help. So, she loses on appeal. So, the answer would be she loses because the state's statute doesn't prevent malice. But looking at the options, the correct answer would be that she cannot show malice existed, so the state's statute doesn't help, so she loses.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: lose, because the presumption may be rebutted. That would mean that the state's statute allows the burden to shift to her. But no, the state's statute says the burden is on her to show malice didn't exist. So, if she can't, she loses.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that she can't show malice, so loses. The state's statute doesn't prevent that. So, she can't avoid the murder charge, so loses.

The options don't have an option that directly states this. Let me look again.

Options:

A: lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.

B: win, because statute violates due process.

C: lose, because presumption may be rebutted.

D: win, because she acted in self-defense.

E: lose, because premeditated.

F: win, because statute is unjust.

G: lose, because she didn't show malice.

H: win, because state is discriminatory.

I: lose, because she failed to overcome the presumption.

J: other option.

Wait, the correct reasoning is that the state's statute says malice is presumed. So, the burden is on the defendant to show malice didn't exist. She can't show that, so she loses. So, the answer would be that she loses because the state's statute doesn't prevent malice. But looking at the options, option G says she loses because she didn't show malice. That's correct.

So, the answer is G: lose because she didn't show malice existed.

The scenario involves a defendant who was tried for murder and challenges the conviction under a state's statute that presumes malice. The statute imposes a burden on the defendant to prove malice did not exist. The defendant's defense includes self-defense, which is a defense against malice rather than a defense against malice as per the statute. 

Under the state's statute, the burden is on the defendant to show malice did not exist. Since the defendant acted in self-defense, which is not malice, she cannot prove malice, and thus the burden is not met. Therefore, the defendant cannot avoid the murder charge, and the state's statute does not prevent this outcome. 

Looking at the options, the correct reasoning is that the defendant did not show malice existed, so she loses. The correct answer is:

**G: lose, because she did not show that malice did not exist.**

ANSWER: G
