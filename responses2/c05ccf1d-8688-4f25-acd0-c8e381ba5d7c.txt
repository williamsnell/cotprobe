Okay, let's tackle this logarithm question. The question is asking for the logarithm of 3 squared, which is 3^2. So, I need to find log(3²).

Wait, logarithms can be tricky. I remember that the logarithm of a power can be simplified using a logarithm property. Oh right, log(a^b) equals b times log(a). So, applying that here, log(3²) is the same as 2 * log(3).

Now I need to figure out what log(3) is. I think log base 10 is usually used, unless specified otherwise. So, log_10(3). I'm not exactly sure of the value, but I remember that log(3) is approximately 0.4771. Let me confirm that. Oh wait, yes, I think that's right. So, 2 * 0.4771 equals 0.9542. So the logarithm of 3 squared is 0.9542.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.0986, which is ln(3), not log base 10. Option B is 3, which doesn't make sense because log(3) is about 0.5. Option A is 6, that's too high. Option I is 2, which is log base 10 of 100, but 3 squared is 9, not 100. Option J is 0.3010, which is log base 10 of 2. Option F and G are decimals but they don't seem right either. Option D is 0.6021, which is log base 2 of 3, because 2^1.6021 is roughly 3. Option H is 2.3026, which is ln(10), but again, that's not log base 10.

So, the correct answer should be 0.9542, which is option C.

The logarithm of 3 squared is calculated using the power rule: log(3²) = 2 * log(3). Since log(3) is approximately 0.4771, multiplying by 2 gives 0.9542. The correct option is C.

Answer: C
