Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about finding the empirical formula of a compound based on its percentages. Hmm, let's see. The percentages given are 51.9% carbon, 4.86% hydrogen, and 43.2% bromine. I remember that the empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of atoms in a compound. So, I need to convert these percentages into moles and then find the ratio.

Wait, how do I do that exactly? Oh right, I think I should assume a 100g sample because the percentages are already per 100g. That makes it easier. So, 51.9g C, 4.86g H, and 43.2g Br.

Next step is to convert each mass into moles. Moles are calculated by dividing the mass by the molar mass of the element. But wait, I don't have the molar masses of C, H, and Br. Oh, right, I remember their approximate values. Carbon is about 12 g/mol, hydrogen is about 1 g/mol, and bromine is approximately 80 g/mol (since I think Br is about 80, but wait, maybe I'll double-check). Let me jot that down:

Molar masses:
- C: 12.01 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- Br: 79.90 g/mol (I think I should use that more accurately)

So for each element, I'll calculate moles:

Carbon: 51.9 g / 12.01 g/mol = approximately 4.323 moles.
Hydrogen: 4.86 g / 1.008 g/mol = around 4.825 moles.
Bromine: 43.2 g / 79.90 g/mol = approximately 0.540 moles.

Wait, but I'm getting these numbers. Now I need to find the mole ratios. So, I should divide each by the smallest number of moles to get the simplest ratio.

The smallest number among the moles is approximately 0.540 moles (bromine). So I'll divide each by 0.540.

C: 4.323 / 0.540 ≈ 8
H: 4.825 / 0.540 ≈ 8.935 (about 9)
Br: 0.540 / 0.540 = 1

Wait, that gives me C8, H9, Br1. But looking at the options, option B is C5H3Br, option C is C10H8Br, option B's ratio doesn't match with my calculation.

Wait, maybe I should check my calculations again because there might be a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate each step.

Carbon: 51.9 / 12.01 → 51.9 /12.01= approx 4.323 (yes)
Hydrogen: 4.86 /1.008 → let's compute accurately. 4.86 ÷1.008. Let me compute 1.008 *4=4.032, 1.008*4.8= maybe 4.86? Let's see: 1.008 *4.8=4.8384. So 4.86-4.8384=0.0216. 0.0216/1.008=approx 0.0214. So total is 4.8214. So approximately 4.8214 moles.
Bromine: 43.2 /79.90 → 43.2 ÷79.90 → Let me think, 79.90 *0.54 = about 43.146. Oh wait, 0.54 *79.90 = 43.146, which is very close to 43.2. So 43.2 /79.90 ≈0.5405.

So bromine is approximately 0.5405 moles.

Now, the ratios:

C: 4.323 /0.5405 ≈ 8 (since 0.5405 *8=4.324)
H:4.8214 /0.5405 ≈ 8.93 → which is roughly 9.
Br: 0.5405 /0.5405 =1.

So the ratio is 8:9:1. But looking at the options, none of them have C8H9Br. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: C6H7Br → 6,7,1
B: C5H3Br →5,3,1
C: C10H8Br →10,8,1
D: C7H6Br2 →7,6,2
E: C6H4Br3 →6,4,3
F: C12H22Br →12,22,1
G: C8H9Br →8,9,1 → Oh wait, that's C8H9Br. But in my calculation, I have C8H9Br. So that would be option G.

But wait, looking at the options, option G is C8H9Br, but the other way I thought, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles more accurately.

Carbon: 51.9 /12.01 = let me compute exactly.

12.01 *4 =48.04 → 48.04 <51.9 → 51.9-48.04=3.86 → 3.86 /12.01 → approx 0.321, so total is 4.321 moles.

Hydrogen: 4.86 /1.008 = let's compute 1.008 *4 =4.032. 4.86 -4.032=0.828. 0.828 /1.008= approx 0.82. So total is 4.82 moles.

Bromine: 43.2 /79.90 → 43.2 ÷79.9 is approximately 0.5405. So 0.5405.

So the ratios:

C: 4.323 / 0.5405 = let's compute 4.323 /0.5405.

0.5405 *8=4.324 → so 8 exactly. The moles are almost exactly 8, 9, and 1. So the ratio is 8:9:1.

Looking at the options, option G is C8H9Br. So that must be the correct answer.

To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we start by converting the given percentages into moles. Assuming a 100 g sample:

- Carbon: \( \frac{51.9 \, \text{g}}{12.01 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 4.323 \, \text{mol} \)
- Hydrogen: \( \frac{4.86 \, \text{g}}{1.008 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 4.821 \, \text{mol} \)
- Bromine: \( \frac{43.2 \, \text{g}}{79.90 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.5405 \, \text{mol} \)

Next, we find the mole ratio by dividing each by the smallest number of moles (0.5405 mol for bromine):

- Carbon: \( \frac{4.323}{0.5405} \approx 8 \)
- Hydrogen: \( \frac{4.821}{0.5405} \approx 9 \)
- Bromine: \( \frac{0.5405}{0.5405} = 1 \)

This gives a ratio of \( 8:9:1 \). Comparing this with the options:

- **Option G**: \( \text{C}_8\text{H}_9\text{Br} \) matches the ratio \( 8:9:1 \).

Thus, the empirical formula of the compound is \( \text{C}_8\text{H}_9\text{Br} \).
