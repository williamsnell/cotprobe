Okay, so I've got this question about partnership structures and termination. Let me see if I can figure it out.

The question says that on January 1, the partners' capital profits and losses are: Ross 15%, Stone 35%, and Taylor 50%. Then, on April 9, Stone sells his entire interest to Taylor. The question is about what happens to the status of the partnershipâ€”whether it's terminated or not.

Hmm, I remember that in partnerships, if someone sells all their interest, it's considered a termination if the selling partner's share was a significant portion. But wait, what's the rule there? I think it's called the "significant interest rule" where if a partner owns more than 80% of the partnership, they can sell their interest. But if they own less than 80%, they can sell all their interest.

Wait no, the significant interest threshold is 80%. So in this case, Stone initially had 35%, and after selling all, his 35% would be his new interest in the partnership. Taylor's interest increases from 50% to 85% (35% from Stone and 50% new). So Taylor now has 85% of the partnership.

Now, the question is about the status of the partnership. Does the partnership terminate when a partner sells all their interest? I think that's when the partnership is terminated. Because if one partner sells all their share, the partnership is over, so it's no longer a partnership but a corporation.

Wait, let me think again. If a partner sells all their interest, the partnership is terminated. So, on April 9, when Stone sells his entire interest to Taylor, the partnership is terminated. So the answer would be that it's terminated as of April 9.

Looking at the options, option F says "Studio terminated as of April 9." Option E says "Studio did not terminate but was restructured." Option G says "Studio terminated as of December 31." But the question is when. The sale happens on April 9, so the partnership ends then.

Wait, but option F says it's as of April 9. Let me double-check. If a partner sells all interest, the partnership is terminated. So the partnership ends on April 9, so the answer is F.

The sale of a partner's entire interest in a partnership terminates the partnership. On April 9, Stone sells his interest to Taylor, causing the partnership to end. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: Studio terminated as of April 9.**

Answer: F
