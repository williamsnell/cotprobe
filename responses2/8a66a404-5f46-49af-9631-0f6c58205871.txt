Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. The question is about a competitive firm that makes zero economic profit. Hmm, I remember from my microeconomics that when a firm is in a competitive market, it's usually making zero economic profit. But wait, I should think through why that is the case.

Economic profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. If a firm is making zero economic profit, that means the revenue it's generating is exactly equal to its total cost. That makes sense because if it's not making a profit, it's not incurring any extra costs beyond what's necessary to stay in the industry.

Now, the question is asking what the owner of such a firm will most likely do in the long run. The options are A to J. So, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Will make more profits in the long run. That doesn't sound right. In the long run, if a firm is already making zero economic profit, they shouldn't make more because that would mean they're expanding to take advantage of more profits. Plus, in competitive markets, firms have the freedom to enter or exit the market without affecting prices much.

Option B: Is making a loss and should change her business strategy. No, because if it's exactly zero economic profit, it's not making a loss or a gain. It's covering its opportunity costs. So, this option isn't correct.

Option C: Is making less than normal profits. Wait, normal profits are exactly what you would earn in a perfectly competitive market, right? So if a firm is making zero economic profit, it's making normal profits. Making less than that would mean it's not covering all its costs, including the normal return. So this option seems incorrect.

Option D: Is not making any profit at all. Again, if it's zero economic profit, it's not making any profit. It's making what it needs to cover its costs. So D is not correct.

Option E: Should expand her business for more profit. That doesn't make sense either. If a firm is already making zero economic profit, it's not taking on more risks or opportunities that would lead to higher profits. Expansion would likely increase costs or reduce profits.

Option F: Is earning exceptionally high profits. That's the opposite of what's happening. It's not making more than it can, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Is making more than what she would make in her next best alternative job. Hmm, this sounds like she's comparing her firm's profit to the next best alternative. If she's not making economic profit, it implies she's not better off working elsewhere. But I'm not sure if that's a direct implication of being at zero economic profit. Maybe it's about whether she should focus on her business rather than other opportunities.

Option H: Should lower her prices to increase profits. Lowering prices would generally reduce profit margins, not increase them. Unless there's perfect competition and other factors, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option I: Should consider shutting down because she could make more elsewhere. If a firm is making zero economic profit, it's not covering all its costs, including normal profit. So shutting down would mean losing the normal profit, which isn't advisable. So I is not the right answer.

Option J: Is making exactly what she would make in her next best alternative job. Wait, if the firm is making zero economic profit, that means it's not making more than the next best alternative. Because the next best alternative would be any other option she could take. So J is saying she's making exactly as much as the next best alternative, which aligns with being in a competitive market where she's neither making a profit nor incurring losses beyond what's normal. So J is correct.

Let me double-check. Economic profit is revenue minus total cost. At zero economic profit, revenue equals total cost. So the firm is making normal profits. It's not making a loss or an economic loss. So the owner shouldn't be making any profits. So option D is incorrect. But the question is about what she will most likely do. Option J says she's making exactly what she would make in her next best alternative. That makes sense because if she's making zero economic profit, she's not making more than the next best option. So the answer should be J.

The correct answer is J: is making exactly what she would make in her next best alternative job.
