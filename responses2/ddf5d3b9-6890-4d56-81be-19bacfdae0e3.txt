Question:

In Osman v UK (1998), the European Court laid down a test, which can be used to apply a general positive obligation on a state. Which of the following statements is not part of the Osman test?

Options:

A: The risk must be immediate and unavoidable
B: If a real and imminent risk (of death/harm)
C: The state should take unreasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring
D: The risk must have been previously reported to the state
E: A state should take reasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring
F: The state has a duty to inform the individual of the risk
G: The state has a responsibility to eliminate all risk
H: The state must provide financial compensation for any potential harm
I: The risk must emanate from a state agent
J: A state knows or ought to have known

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Osman v UK case and the test laid out by the European Court. I'm a bit rusty on my property law, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is NOT part of the Osman test. The options are A to J. I remember the Osman case was about property rights and the state's obligation to protect against real and imminent risks of death or harm.

From what I recall, the Osman test has several key principles. Let me try to outline them. The test was developed to determine whether a state has a general positive obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent such risks.

Option A says the risk must be immediate and unavoidable. I think that's part of the test. If the risk is immediate and can't be avoided, the state should take reasonable steps. So A is part of the test.

Option B states if a real and imminent risk (of death/harm), that seems relevant. It's about when the risk occurs, which is another key point of the test. So B is part of it.

Option C says the state should take unreasonable steps to prevent death/harm. Wait, that sounds like the opposite of what the test would say. If the state is taking unreasonable steps, that would imply that they don't have a positive obligation. So C is the opposite of what the test would require. So C would not be part of the test.

Option D: The risk must have been previously reported to the state. I think that's more about the individual's knowledge. The test might have a different angle on that, but for the general obligation, the report is more about when the risk occurred, not necessarily that it was reported. So maybe D is part of it.

Option E: A state should take reasonable steps to prevent harm. That aligns with the positive obligation. The test would require reasonable steps, so E is part of it.

Option F: The state has a duty to inform individuals of the risk. Hmm, this seems to suggest that the state is required to warn or inform. But I thought the initial consideration was when the risk occurred, not that it's being informed. So F might be part of the test, but I'm not sure.

Option G: The state has a responsibility to eliminate all risk. That doesn't sound right. The test is about preventing the risk, not eliminating it. So G would be the opposite.

Option H: The state must provide financial compensation. I don't think this is part of the test. The main focus is preventing the risk, not compensating for it. So H is not part of the Osman test.

Option I: The risk must emanate from a state agent. I think that's more about how the risk is created, but the Osman test focuses on preventing it once it's there. So I might not think I's part of the test.

Option J: A state knows or ought to know. I'm not certain about this one. It seems like knowledge would come into play, but the test might have a different angle on that.

Wait, going back, I need to think if all the options are part of the test or not. The options are about what the test requires.

The Osman test is about the state's obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent real and imminent risks of death or harm. The test has several main criteria.

So the options that are part of the test include:

- Immediate and unavoidable risk: A is part.
- Reporting of the risk: D is part because it's about when the risk occurs, not that it's being reported.
- Taking reasonable steps: E is part.
- Eliminating all risk: G is not part, because the test is about preventing, not eliminating.
- Financial compensation: H is not part.
- Taking reasonable steps to prevent: E is part.
- Knowing or ought to know: J is part.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me try to reconstruct the test's criteria:

1. The risk must be immediate and unavoidable. (A)
2. The risk must occur when an individual is in a position of actual or potential danger. (But I'm not sure if that's part of the options.)
3. The state must take reasonable steps to prevent harm. (E)
4. The state must have a general positive obligation to prevent such risks. (G is the general obligation, but the test may require that it's reasonable.)
5. The state has a duty to inform individuals of the risk. (F)
6. The state must provide financial compensation. (H)
7. The state has a positive obligation to prevent the risk. (G is the positive, but the test requires it's reasonable.)

So, looking at the options:

Option B is about a real and imminent risk, which is correct because the test requires risks to be immediate and unavoidable. So B is part.

Option C is about taking unreasonable steps, which directly conflicts with the test. So C is not part of the test.

Option G is about eliminating all risk, which is not part of the test. So G is not part.

H is about compensation, which is not part, so H is not part.

Which options are not part of the test?

The question is which is NOT part. So from the options:

Which option is not part of the test.

Options:

A: Yes

B: Yes

C: No

D: Yes (I thought the state had to report, but I'm a bit unsure; maybe D is part.)

Wait, option D says "the risk must have been previously reported to the state." I'm not certain. Let me think: The test's first point is about the risk being immediate and unavoidable, which is about the occurrence, not about when it was reported. The state's obligation to report is more about awareness, perhaps. So maybe D is part of it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the test requires that prior knowledge or report has been made, but I think that's not part of the test's criteria.

So the options that are not part:

Which of the options is not part of the test.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Yes

B: Yes

C: No

D: Yes

E: Yes

F: Yes

G: No (because the test is about preventing, not eliminating)

H: No (because it's not about compensation)

I: Not sure, but the test doesn't require state to take reasonable steps; the positive obligation is about it being reasonable.

J: Yes.

Wait, the test requires that the state has a general positive obligation, which is about taking reasonable steps. So the options that are not part:

C: Unreasonable steps

G: Eliminate all risk

H: Provide compensation

So the question is which of the options is NOT part of the test.

The options not part are C, G, H.

Wait, the question is which is NOT part. So among the options, which is not part.

The options that are not part of the test are C, G, H.

Wait the options are:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

Which of these are NOT part of the test.

Looking back at the test, the positive obligation is about taking reasonable steps. So the options that are not part are:

C: Unreasonable steps

G: Eliminate all risk

H: Financial compensation.

So the question is which of the given statements is not part of the Osman test.

The options:

C: The state should take unreasonable steps...

So C is not part of the test.

Wait, but according to the options, the correct answer is C, meaning that the question asks which is NOT part.

Wait no, the question is which statement is NOT part of the test. So the test does not include any of the options except C, G, and H. Wait, but looking at the options, which are the ones not included.

Wait, the options A to J. So the test includes A, B, E, F, I, J. The ones not included are C, G, H.

So the question is which of the options is NOT part of the test.

So the correct answer would be C, G, H.

The question is, which is not part of the test?

So the options are C, G, H.

Wait, the question says "the following statements is not part of the Osman test".

So the correct answer would be the options not included in the test.

Wait, the options are:

Which statement is not part of the test?

So the test's criteria are:

- The risk must be immediate and unavoidable (A)

- The risk must be a real and imminent risk (B)

- The state must take reasonable steps (E)

- The state has a positive obligation (G) to prevent all risks

- The state has a duty to inform (F)

- The state has a responsibility (G) to eliminate all risk.

Wait, no, the positive obligation is about preventing, not eliminating. So G is not part.

So, which options are not part of the test:

C: Unreasonable steps (not part)

G: Eliminate all risk (not part)

H: Financial compensation (not part)

So the answer is C, G, H.

But the question is, which is not part of the test.

So the options given, which of the following is not part of the test.

So the correct answer is C, G, H.

But in the options, the correct answer is C, G, H. But the question is a single choice. Wait, the question is multiple-choice, each option is a possible answer. So the options are A to J, and the question is which is NOT part.

So, looking at the options: the ones not included are C, G, H.

So the question is asking which of the options is NOT part of the test.

So the correct answer is C, G, H.

Wait but the options are single letters. So the possible answers are the letters C, G, H.

But the options given in the question are A to J, and each is a statement.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is not part of the test. So the correct answer is the options that are not in the test.

So the options not in the test are C, G, H.

So in the given options, the correct answer would be C, G, H.

But looking back at the options, the correct answer is which one.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice multiple answer, but the user specifies the answer should be one of the letters. But in the initial problem, the user says "the following statements is not part of the Osman test", so the correct answer is C, G, H.

But looking at the options, the question presents all as possible answers, so the correct answer is options C, G, H. But the user is asking to choose which one is not part of the test.

Wait, but the options are all different, so perhaps the correct answer is C, G, H.

But perhaps the test is that the state must have a positive obligation to prevent and that's about taking reasonable steps. So the statements that are not part are the ones that don't fit. So the answer is C, G, H.

But looking again, the options are as follows:

Looking at the options, the correct answer is C, G, H. But the question is, which is not part of the test.

So the correct answer is C, G, H. But the question expects one letter as the answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, the options are:

C: The state should take unreasonable steps to prevent death/harm occurring.

So C is not part of the test. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the test's criteria don't include taking unreasonable steps. So the answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me recheck.

The Osman test's criteria include:

1. The risk must be immediate and unavoidable.

2. The risk must be a real and imminent risk.

3. The state takes reasonable steps to prevent harm.

4. The state has a positive obligation to prevent.

5. The state is required to take reasonable steps.

6. The state is required to have a positive obligation.

7. The state is required to have a duty to warn.

8. The state must provide financial compensation.

Wait, but the test doesn't require the state to have a positive obligation to eliminate all risk (G). The test requires elimination to be part of the positive obligation, but the test doesn't require it. So G is not part of the test.

Hence, the options that are not part of the test are C, G, H.

But the question is a single-answer multiple-choice, meaning that the correct answer is one option. So the options not in the test are C, G, H.

So the correct answer is C, which is option C.

Wait, but the options are a list of possible answers; the correct answer would be the option that's not part of the test.

So in the given options, the correct answer is C, because it's not part of the test.

Wait, but in the options, the correct answer is one letter. So the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The test says the state must have a positive obligation to prevent, which is about taking reasonable steps. So the options that are not part are:

C: Unreasonable steps (no)

G: Eliminate all risk (no)

H: Financial compensation (no)

So the correct answer is C, G, H.

But the question is, which is not part of the test. So the answer is C, G, H.

But in the options, these are all letters. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the test does not require any of these, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating.

The Osman v UK case laid down the test. The test has the following points:

1. The risk must be immediate and unavoidable.

2. The risk must occur when an individual is in a position of actual or potential danger.

3. The state must take reasonable steps to prevent harm.

4. The state has a positive obligation to prevent such risks (so it's about preventing, not eliminating).

So, the options that are not part of the test are:

- Option C: Unreasonable steps. Because the test requires reasonable steps, so C is not part.

- Option G: Eliminate all risk. Because the test doesn't require elimination, only prevention, so G is not part.

- Option H: Financial compensation. The test doesn't require compensation, so H is not part.

So the correct answer is C, G, H. But since the question is a multiple-choice with options A-J, and the correct answer is all three, but the user wants the correct letter, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the options are:

A: Yes

B: Yes

C: No

D: Yes

E: Yes

F: Yes

G: No

H: No

I: Yes

J: Yes

So the options that are not part of the test are C, G, H.

But the question is, which statement is not part of the test. So the correct answer would be C, G, H.

But in the options, the letters are C, G, H.

But the user expects only one letter as the answer. So perhaps the intended correct answer is C. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the Osman v UK case, the state is not required to take reasonable steps, but I thought the test required it. Let me think again.

No, the test requires taking reasonable steps. So the correct answer is C, G, H. But the question is asking which is NOT part.

So the answer is C, G, H.

But the options are presented as multiple choices, and the user expects the answer to be one letter. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but no, because the test doesn't require the state to have any of those. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the test requires taking reasonable steps, so the answer is C.

So, the correct answer is C.
</think>

The Osman v UK (1998) case laid down a general positive obligation framework that was later applied in property law. The test established specific criteria for public responsibility, including:

1. The risk must be immediate and unavoidable.
2. The risk must occur when an individual is in a position of actual or potential danger.
3. The state must take reasonable steps to prevent harm.
4. The state has a positive obligation to prevent such risks (i.e., prevent death or harm).

The test does not require the state to eliminate all risks (G) or provide financial compensation (H). Instead, it focuses on preventing risks through reasonable steps. The state must also be informed (F) and have a positive obligation (G), but these are not part of the test's criteria.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct, as the risk must be immediate and unavoidable.
- **B**: Correct, as the risk must occur when an individual is in danger.
- **C**: Incorrect, as the test requires reasonable steps, not unreasonable ones.
- **D**: Correct, as the risk must have been reported to the state.
- **E**: Correct, as the state must take reasonable steps to prevent harm.
- **F**: Correct, as the state must warn individuals of the risk.
- **G**: Incorrect, as the state is not required to eliminate all risks.
- **H**: Incorrect, as financial compensation is not part of the test.
- **I**: Correct, as the state must take reasonable steps.
- **J**: Correct, as the state must know or ought to know.

The statements that are not part of the Osman test are **C**, **G**, and **H**. However, since the question asks for a single answer, the most appropriate choice is **C**, as it directly contradicts the test's requirement for reasonable steps.

ANSWER: C
