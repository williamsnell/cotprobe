Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about learned helplessness. I remember that learned helplessness is a psychological phenomenon where people lose their ability to regulate their responses to tasks after they've already learned how to perform them. So, the question states that giving solvable problems eliminated the helplessness caused by unsolvable ones. It's arguing that this is due to something else, and I need to pick the correct option.

The options are A to H. Let me think about what each option means.

Option A: Shift in locus of control from internal to external. I think locus of control refers to what someone can control themselves. If someone's control is shifted to external factors, like external pressure or the environment, maybe they lose internal drive. But I'm not sure how that directly causes helplessness in unsolvable problems.

Option B: Reduction in stress levels from solvable problems. Solvable problems are easier to handle, so maybe that reduces stress, which in turn reduces helplessness. But the question says it's due to a change in something else, maybe not just stress levels.

Option C: Continuous reinforcement schedule. That's a model where rewards are given repeatedly to encourage behavior. But in the context of helplessness, I'm not sure how continuous reinforcement would apply.

Option D: Practice effect. I think the practice effect is when repeated practice enhances performance, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to helplessness. Like, maybe more practice builds confidence, but the question is about eliminating helplessness.

Option E: Boost in self-confidence after solving problems. Oh, that sounds plausible. If the problems are solvable, maybe the person's confidence increases, which would help them overcome the need to resist helplessness. So maybe this is the answer.

Option F: Development of a coping mechanism. That's about finding ways to deal with problems. If problems are solvable, maybe the person develops a way to cope, which reduces helplessness.

Option G: Change in attribution. Once problems are solvable, the person might attribute success differently, maybe seeing it as a result of their own efforts rather than external factors. But how does that eliminate helplessness? Maybe it's about understanding success better, which could reduce feelings of helplessness.

Option H: Partial reinforcement schedule. Similar to continuous reinforcement, but not all rewards are given. Maybe not the right fit.

Option I: Partial reinforcement schedule. Wait, that's the same as H, so probably not.

So, the main points are that solvable problems reduce helplessness. So the options that fit are E, F, G, or H.

Let me think again. In the context of learned helplessness, when problems are solvable, the person's need for helplessness diminishes. So the eliminated helplessness is because the problems became easier, so you can handle them without needing to resist. That makes me think E is about self-confidence, which would help. Or F, which is about coping, which would prevent helplessness.

But the question is about the cause. The argument is that solvable problems eliminate helplessness caused by unsolvable. So what's eliminating the helplessness caused by unsolvable? The solvable ones eliminate the negative effect of unsolvable.

So maybe the change is the solvable problems lead to a reduction in the need to resist helplessness. So perhaps the helplessness arises from unsolvable problems, and solvable ones make it easier to handle, so the need to resist it goes away.

Wait, the question says that giving solvable problems eliminated the helplessness caused by unsolvable. So the solvable ones are handling the problem, and the unsolvable ones were causing the problem. So the solvable ones made the problem easier, so the person no longer needed to resist helplessness. Thus, the cause is that the problems are solvable, so the need for helplessness is eliminated.

Which options explain that? Maybe the solvable problems lead to a reduction in the need for helplessness. So that would be the elimination as a result.

Looking at the options again, option E is a boost in self-confidence. That would make sense because if the problems are solvable, the person's confidence goes up, which helps them not feel helpless. So E would be the cause.

Alternatively, option F is a change in coping mechanism. If the person can solve them, maybe they develop a better coping strategy, which would prevent helplessness.

Option G is a change in attribution, making success seem more personal. That could reduce the sense of helplessness because the person might attribute success to their own effort rather than external factors.

So the options that cause helplessness to be eliminated are either the problem becoming solvable leading to confidence boost (E), coping mechanism (F), or change in attribution (G). But the question is about the cause of the elimination, which is due to which factor.

I think the question is asking for the reason why the helplessness is eliminated, not just that it's eliminated. So the application of solvable problems led to this.

Wait, the question states that the solvable problems eliminated the helplessness caused by unsolvable. So the solvable problems removed the need for helplessness, which is probably because the problems were easier, so the person's need for helplessness (which is a negative emotion) is reduced.

So the elimination is due to the problems being solvable, which reduces the need for helplessness.

But the options don't directly say "the solvable problems reduced the need for helplessness", but the options are about the cause of this.

So, the correct answer must be one of these. Let's see:

E is about self-confidence. If solvable problems are easier, the person can solve them more easily, which boosts self-confidence. That would help them not feel helpless.

F is about developing a coping mechanism. If the problems are solvable, maybe the person finds a way to cope with them more effectively, reducing helplessness.

G is about changing the way they attribute success, which might make success seem more personal, reducing the need for helplessness.

So the answer likely is E, F, G, or H. But options D and E refer to self-confidence and coping.

In the context of learned helplessness, the main theory is that when a task becomes easier, the person's need for helplessness is eliminated. So that would be an application of a partial reinforcement schedule (because solvable problems allow for more rewards, perhaps). Wait, but that's option I, which is the same as H.

Wait, the question is about the reason why the solvable problems eliminate the helplessness caused by unsolvable. So perhaps the reason is that the problems became solvable, which caused a reduction in the need for helplessness.

Which of the options directly relates to the problems being easier, leading to increased confidence (E), or to the development of a coping mechanism (F), or an alteration in how success is attributed (G).

So E is about self-confidence. If solvable problems lead to more confidence, that would help. F is about coping, so perhaps the person can handle them without helplessness. G is about the way success is seen, perhaps leading to less helplessness.

But the question is about the cause of the eliminated helplessness. So, the cause is that the problems became easier, leading to more self-confidence and better coping, and perhaps a more positive view of success.

So the correct answer would be E: a boost in self-confidence after solving problems.

Alternatively, if the solvable problems allow the person to practice, leading to more confidence (E), or perhaps the practice leads to better performance and less helplessness.

Wait, maybe the key point is that when the problems are solvable, the person's need for helplessness is reduced because their performance is easier. So, perhaps the solvable problems lead to a reduction in the need for helplessness.

But the options don't directly say that. So in this context, the correct answer is likely E: a boost in self-confidence after solving problems.

Alternatively, another possibility is F: a change in coping mechanism. Maybe without the problems being solvable, the person was struggling and developed a coping strategy, but once solvable, they can use it without needing helplessness.

But I'm a bit torn between E and F. Another approach is to think about the concept of 'learned helplessness'. It's often explained that when a task is made easier, the need for helplessness is eliminated.

So, in the case of solvable problems, the person can handle them without needing to resist helplessness as much. So the elimination is because the problems became easier. But the options don't directly state that; instead, they relate to the factors that cause this.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because when problems are solvable, the person can solve them without the need to resist, so their confidence increases, thus helping them overcome helplessness.

Alternatively, another angle: the application of a partial reinforcement schedule (option I) would involve rewarding the person for solving problems, which could be a way to eliminate the need for helplessness. So perhaps the solvable problems are being rewarded, which is a partial reinforcement.

Wait, but the options are about the cause, not the application.

So, the solvable problems eliminate helplessness because the problems were unsolvable, making them easier to handle. So the cause is the problems becoming easier, which leads to more self-confidence.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: a boost in self-confidence after solving problems.

The question asks why solvable problems eliminate the helplessness caused by unsolvable problems, focusing on the options provided. The key concept here is that solvable problems make the task easier, reducing the need for helplessness. Among the options, the best fit is the one that explains how solvable problems lead to increased confidence, which helps alleviate helplessness.

- **Option A**: Shift in locus of control is less relevant to the question.
- **Option B**: Stress levels are reduced, but this doesn't directly explain helplessness.
- **Option C**: Continuous reinforcement isn't the focus here.
- **Option D**: Practice effect refers to performance improvement, not directly to helplessness.
- **Option E**: A boost in self-confidence directly addresses the elimination of helplessness by making problems easier.
- **Option F**: Development of a coping mechanism could prevent helplessness but doesn't directly explain the cause.
- **Option G**: Change in attribution affects how success is perceived but doesn't directly explain the elimination of helplessness.
- **Option H**: Partial reinforcement schedule could be a factor but isn't explicitly stated.
- **Option I**: Partial reinforcement is the same as H, so it's not applicable.

The most direct explanation is that solvable problems reduce the need for helplessness by increasing self-confidence.
