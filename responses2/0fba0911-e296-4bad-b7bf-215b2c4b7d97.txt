Question:

A shoe factory has fixed costs of $1200 per day, and variable costs of $1.50 per shoe. Find a linear cost function to represent their daily costs.

Options:

A: Cost = 1200 + X
B: Cost = 1500 + 1.5 X
C: Cost = 1200 + 1.5 X
D: Cost = 1200 + 1.75 X
E: Cost = 1000 + 2 X
F: Cost = 1200 + 2 X
G: Cost = 1200 + 0.75 X
H: Cost = 1100 + 1.25 X
I: Cost = 1300 + 1.5 X
J: Cost = 1000 + 1.5 X

Okay, so I've got this question about a shoe factory's cost function. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that cost functions are usually linear, which means they have a fixed cost and a variable cost that depends on the number of units produced.

The question says the factory has fixed costs of $1200 per day. Fixed costs don't change with the number of shoes produced, right? So that part is straightforward, the fixed term is 1200.

Then there's variable costs of $1.50 per shoe. Variable costs depend on how many shoes they make. So for each shoe produced, they add $1.50 to the total cost. So the variable part would be 1.5 multiplied by the number of shoes, which I'll call X.

Putting it together, the total cost should be fixed cost plus variable cost. So the cost function would be Cost = 1200 + 1.5X.

Looking at the options, let's check each one. 

Option A is Cost = 1200 + X. That's missing the 0.5, so the variable cost is wrong. No, that's not right.

Option B is 1500 +1.5X. Wait, fixed cost is wrong. It's 1500 instead of 1200. So definitely not. 

Option C is 1200 +1.5X. Oh, that's what I thought. So that fits.

Option D is 1200 +1.75X. That's a higher variable cost. Probably wrong.

Option E: 1000 +2X. Fixed cost is too low, and variable is higher. No, that's not correct.

Option F: 1200 +2X. Variable cost is too high. 2 is higher than 1.5. So nope.

Option G: 1200 +0.75X. Variable cost is way too low. They pay 1.5 per shoe, so this is wrong.

Option H: 1100 +1.25X. Fixed is wrong; it's 1100, which isn't 1200. Variable is low. No.

Option I: 1300 +1.5X. Fixed is too high. They have 1200, so incorrect.

Option J: 1000 +1.5X. Fixed is wrong again. 1000 instead of 1200.

So the only correct one is C, which has 1200 as fixed and 1.5X as variable.

The correct cost function is derived by adding the fixed cost and the variable cost. The fixed cost is $1200, and the variable cost is $1.50 per shoe, which translates to 1.5X. Therefore, the function is:

Cost = 1200 + 1.5X.

This matches option C.
