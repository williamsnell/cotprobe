Okay, so I've got this problem here about Lebesgue measure, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The set A is defined as { n + sum_{p=1}^∞ a_p 2^{-2p} : n is an integer, a_p is 0 or 1 }. So, it's a set of real numbers constructed by adding an integer n to an infinite sum where each term is either 0 or 1 multiplied by 2^{-2p}. Hmm, that seems like it's building numbers in some kind of binary expansion but with weights based on p squared.

Wait, 2^{-2p} is the same as (1/4)^p, right? So each term is (1/4)^p. So the sum is from p=1 to infinity, which is like the sum of (1/4)^p. Oh wait, that's a geometric series. The sum of (1/4)^p from p=1 to infinity is (1/4)/(1 - 1/4) )= (1/4)/(3/4)=1/3. So the sum part is 1/3. So each element in A is an integer n plus 1/3. But since n is any integer, this would cover all numbers of the form k + 1/3, where k is an integer. But wait, that's not quite right because each term a_p can be 0 or 1, so the sum isn't fixed at 1/3; it can vary depending on the a_p's.

Wait, no. The sum is over p=1 to infinity—so for each p, a_p is either 0 or 1. So the sum is a binary expansion where each digit is weighted by 2^{-2p}, which is 4^{-p}. So the sum is like a base-4 expansion, but each digit is either 0 or 1. So each number in A is of the form n + sum_{p=1}^∞ a_p 4^{-p}, where a_p is 0 or 1. So the set A is a collection of points spaced at intervals of 1/4 each, but including all possible such combinations.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a Cantor-like set. Because in the Cantor set, you have points at 1/3 and 2/3, and so on, but in this case, it's a similar pattern but with a base of 4^{-p} instead of 3^{-p}.

Alternatively, since each a_p is binary—0 or 1—the sum can take on various values, but each term is getting smaller as p increases. So the total sum is bounded. Wait, let me compute the maximum possible sum: when all a_p are 1, the sum would be sum_{p=1}^∞ 1*(1/4)^p. That's a geometric series with first term 1/4 and ratio 1/4, so sum is (1/4)/(1 - 1/4))= 1/3. So the maximum sum is 1/3.

So each element in A is n plus a number between 0 (inclusive) and 1/3 (exclusive). Because each a_p contributes 0 or 1/4^p, which are all positive. So for each integer n, A_n = n + [0, 1/3). So A is the union of all these intervals for every integer n.

Wait, but each A_n is an interval of length 1/3. So each contributes 1/3 to the measure. Now, how many such intervals are there? Infinitely many, each for every integer n. But the measure of each is 1/3, and the sum of infinitely many 1/3 measures would be infinite. But wait, that can't be right because the measure of the entire set can't exceed the measure of the real numbers, which is uncountably infinite, but that's a different concept.

Wait, but in this case, each A_n is an interval [n, n + 1/3). But wait, no, because the sum starts at p=1, so the minimum sum is 1/4, which is when a_p=0 for all p. So the sum can't be zero because the first term is 1/4. So the sum is greater than or equal to 1/4.

Wait, so the sum can range from 1/4 to 1/3. So each A_n is [n + 1/4, n + 1/3). So each interval is of length 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12. So the measure of each interval is 1/12.

Now, how many such intervals are there? Infinitely many, but each contributes 1/12. So the total measure would be the sum over n of 1/12, which is infinite. But wait, that's not possible because Lebesgue measure is countably additive, but each interval is a singleton here.

Wait, but no, the number of intervals is countably infinite (each n is an integer, so countable). So if each contributes 1/12, then the measure would be countably infinite times 1/12, which is still infinite. But wait, no, that's not correct because each interval is [n + 1/4, n + 1/3), which has length 1/12. So the measure is the sum of 1/12 for each n, which is infinite. So the total measure would be infinity.

But wait, that can't be right because the set A is a countable union of intervals, each of length 1/12, which would have infinite measure. But that seems too big, because the real numbers have measure infinity, but A is a specific subset.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that in the definition, it's n + sum a_p 2^{-2p}, which is equal to n + sum a_p 4^{-p} (since 2^{-2p} = 4^{-p} ). So each a_p is 0 or 1, so the sum is a binary expansion in base 4. So the numbers in A are of the form n + sum_{p=1}^∞ a_p 4^{-p}. So that's a subset of real numbers. The set of all such numbers for all n is a Cantor-like set but with base 4.

Wait, another approach: think of this as a base-4 expansion, but each digit is either 0 or 1. So each such number is a sum of 4^{-p} for some subset of p's. So the set A is the set of all numbers in [0, 1) that have base-4 expansions with digits only 0 or 1. So this set is similar to the Cantor set, which is formed by removing middle thirds, but in base 4, it's removing digits between 1/4 and 3/4?

Wait, no, maybe. The Cantor set in base 3 is formed by removing the middle third in each step. Here, in base 4, each digit is either 0 or 1, so numbers in [0, 1) that have only 0s and 1s in their base-4 expansion.

So the measure of this set is calculated as follows. Each digit after the decimal (base 4) contributes to the measure. The first digit (p=1) has 0 or 1, so two choices. Each subsequent digit doubles the number of possible numbers, but each digit contributes less: 4^{-p}.

But the measure can be calculated as 1 * sum_{p=1}^∞ 2^{-(p-1)} * 4^{-p}, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the measure of the Cantor set in base 3 is 1/2, but in base 4, perhaps it's different.

Wait, maybe it's similar to the binary case. For the Cantor set, the measure is 1/2. So in this case, perhaps the measure is 1/2.

Wait, wait, let's think again. Each number in A is of the form n + s, where s is a sum of 4^{-p} with a_p=0 or 1. So s can range from 0 (when all a_p=0) up to 1/4 + 1/16 + ... = 1/3. So s is between 0 and 1/3.

Wait, but in the definition, n is any integer, so A is the union of intervals [n, n+1/3). But each of these intervals is 1/3 in length. So the total measure is countably infinite times 1/3, which would be infinite. But that can't be, because the Cantor set is uncountable and has measure zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the entire set as a union of intervals. Each interval is [n, n + 1/3), but each such interval is spaced 1 apart. So the measure is the sum over n of length of each interval, which is 1/3 for each n. So since there are infinitely many n, the measure is infinite. But that can't be because the standard Cantor set has measure zero. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the measure is actually 1/3, but that seems too small. Alternatively, maybe each n contributes an interval of length 1/3, but the set is uncountable, leading to a measure of infinity. But that doesn't make sense because the measure of the entire set A would include all the intervals from each n. However, each interval is [n, n + 1/3), which are all disjoint. So the total measure is the sum of 1/3 for each n, which is infinite.

Wait, but that would suggest the measure is infinity, which isn't one of the options. The options are 1.5, 0.25, 4, 0.5, 0, 1, etc. So maybe I messed up.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the set A as a Cantor set. The standard Cantor set has measure zero, but this set A is constructed with base 4, using digits 0 and 1, which is similar but perhaps not exactly the Cantor set. Wait, in the standard Cantor set, you remove the middle third at each step, but here, perhaps each a_p can be 0 or 1, which allows for a more varied set. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the sum is sum_{p=1}^∞ a_p 4^{-p} = s, where s ranges from 0 to 1/3. But each a_p is 0 or 1, so s can be any number of the form sum_{p=1}^∞ b_p 4^{-p}, where each b_p is 0 or 1. But that's exactly the set of numbers in [0, 1/3] that have base-4 expansions with digits 0 and 1. So the numbers in A are the integers n plus such s, so the measure of A is the same as the measure of s, since the integers don't affect the measure.

So the measure of A is the same as the measure of s. Now, what's the measure of s? Each s is in [0, 1/3]. But s is a sum of 4^{-p} with coefficients 0 or 1. So this is similar to the Cantor set but in base 4. The standard Cantor set in base 3 has measure zero, but perhaps in base 4, it's different.

Wait, the measure of the set of s in [0,1/3) with base-4 expansions using only 0 and 1 is equal to the sum over p of 2^{-(p-1)} * 4^{-p} }, because for each digit, there are two choices (0 or 1), but each digit's contribution is halved because of the two options.

Wait, let's calculate the measure. The measure can be calculated as 1 * sum_{p=1}^∞ 2^{-(p-1)} * 4^{-p}.

Wait, for the first term (p=1), the digit can be 0 or 1. So the contribution is 2^{0} * 4^{-1} = 1/4.

For p=2, each existing interval splits into two, so there are 2 intervals, each contributing 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So the sum for p=2 is 2*(1/16) = 1/8.

Similarly, for p=3, each existing interval splits again, so there are 4 intervals, each contributing 1/4^3 = 1/64. So sum is 4*(1/64) = 1/16.

Wait, so the measure would be the sum over p=1 to ∞ of [number of choices at p] * 4^{-p}. The number of choices at p is 2^{p-1} because each previous split doubles the number of intervals.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, each step, for each existing interval, you can choose a_p=0 or 1, so each interval splits into two. So after p-1 steps, there are 2^{p-1} intervals. Each of these intervals has length 4^{-p}.

So the total measure is sum_{p=1}^∞ 2^{p-1} * 4^{-p} = sum_{p=1}^∞ (2^{p-1}/4^p) ) = sum_{p=1}^∞ (2^{p-1}/4^p) ) = sum_{p=1}^∞ (1/2^{p+1} )).

Wait, wait, 4^p = (2^2)^p = 2^{2p}. So 2^{p-1} / 4^p = 2^{p-1} / 2^{2p} = 2^{-p -1} }.

So the sum becomes sum_{p=1}^∞ 2^{-p-1} } = (1/2) sum_{p=1}^∞ (1/2)^p }.

The sum from p=1 to infinity of (1/2)^p is 1/2 / (1 - 1/2) ) = 1.

So the measure is (1/2) * 1 = 1/2.

Wait, so the measure of s in [0,1/3) is 1/2.

So then, since A is the set {n + s | n ∈ Z }, and each s is in [0,1/3), the measure of A is the same as the measure of s, which is 1/2.

So the measure of A is 1/2, which is 0.5, which is option D.
</think>

The set \( A \) is constructed by adding an integer \( n \) to a sum where each term is \( a_p 2^{-2p} \), which simplifies to \( a_p 4^{-p} \). This sum represents numbers in base 4 with digits 0 or 1. The sum of the series \( \sum_{p=1}^\infty 4^{-p} \) converges to \( \frac{1}{3} \), so \( A \) is the union of intervals \( [n, n + \frac{1}{3}) \) for all integers \( n \). Each interval has length \( \frac{1}{3} \), but the measure of \( A \) is the sum of these lengths, which diverges to infinity. However, the Cantor-like nature of \( A \) (using base 4 with digits 0 and 1) results in a measure of \( \frac{1}{2} \), calculated as the measure of the set of all such numbers.
