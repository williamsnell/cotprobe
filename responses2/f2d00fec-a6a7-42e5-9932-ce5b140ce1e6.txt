Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the pH of a sodium acetate solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I remember. Sodium acetate is NaOAc, right? So it's the sodium salt of acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so its dissociation is partial.

The question gives me the concentration of the solution as 0.10 M. They also provided the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of acetic acid, which is Ka = 1.8 × 10^-5. Oh wait, that's the same as the Ka for acetic acid, which makes sense because the salt is its conjugate base.

Wait, the dissociation of sodium acetate, since it's a salt of a weak acid and a strong base (sodium is a spectator, and acetate comes from acetic acid which is weak). So the acetate ion, OAc^-, is the conjugate base of acetic acid, which is weak. So when sodium acetate dissociates, it's like Na+ and OAc^- ions are released. But since sodium is a strong electrolyte, it completely dissociates, but the acetate doesn't.

So the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to form H+ ions. That's the base behavior of the conjugate base. So the reaction is OAc^- + H2O ↔ H+ + OAc^2-.

To find the pH, I think I need to use the Kb of the acetate ion. Because I know the Ka of acetic acid. So I can find Kb using Kw. Right, since Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C, and Kw = Ka * Kb. So Kb = Kw / Ka.

Let me calculate that. Ka is 1.8e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5. Let me compute that. 1e-14 divided by 1.8e-5 is approximately 5.555...e-10. So Kb is around 5.56e-10.

Now, the acetate ion (OAc^-) is a weak base. So when it reacts with water, it produces H+ and OAc^2-. So the equilibrium expression for this reaction is Kb = [H+][OAc^2-]/[OAc^-].

But wait, since the initial concentration of OAc^- is 0.10 M, and assuming that the dissociation is small (because Kb is small), we can approximate that the change in concentration is small compared to 0.10 M. So [OAc^-] ≈ 0.10 M, [H+] = x, and [OAc^2-] = x. So substituting into the Kb expression: Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.10.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.10. Let's compute that. Kb is 5.56e-10. 0.10 times that is 5.56e-11. So x = sqrt(5.56e-11) ≈ sqrt(5.56) is about 2.358, so x ≈ 2.358e-5.5? Wait, 5.56e-11 is (5.56e-10)*0.1, so sqrt(5.56e-11) = sqrt(5.56) * sqrt(1e-11) = 2.358 * 1e-5.5. Wait, but 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. Wait, sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5, which is 3.16e-6. So 2.358 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 7.43e-6? Wait, wait maybe I made a miscalculation there.

Wait, let me compute it again. sqrt(5.56e-11) = sqrt(5.56) * sqrt(1e-11) = 2.358 * (1e-5.5) ). 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6. So 2.358 * 3.16e-6 = approx 7.43e-6.

So the [H+] concentration is about 7.43e-6. Then pH is -log(7.43e-6). Let's compute that. The log of 7.43 is about 0.872, so 10^(-6 + 0.872) = 10^-5.128. Wait, no, wait, wait. The pH is -log[H+], so 7.43e-6 is 1e-5.128 (because log(7.43e-6) is log(7.43) + (-6) = 0.87 -6 = -5.13. So pH is 5.13 approximately?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. [H+] is 7.43e-6. So pH = -log(7.43e-6) = 5.128. So approx 5.13, which is close to 5.1.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.3, and option G is 5.3. So wait, but wait a minute. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because I'm getting about 5.128. So the pH would be around 5.13.

Wait, but let me double-check the Kb and calculations. So Ka is 1.8e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = 5.555...e-10. Yes. Then, [H+] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.10) = sqrt(5.56e-11) = 7.45e-6. So pH is -log(7.45e-6) = 5.13. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option G as 5.3 and option F as 10.1. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, did I compute the Kb correctly? Let me think again. The acetic acid's Ka is 1.8e-5. So Kb is Kw / Ka, which is 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = 5.555e-10. Yes. So Kb is correct.

Then, the [H+] would be sqrt(Kb * C), where C is 0.10 M. So sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.10) = sqrt(5.56e-11) = 7.45e-6. So pH is 5.13. But none of the options are exactly 5.13. The closest is option G:5.3, and option F is 10.1. Wait, but wait, I must have made a mistake because the options don't include 5.13.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Another approach: perhaps I should have considered the acetate ion as the base and used the Kb expression correctly.

Another approach, maybe using the formula for pH of a weak base. Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and its conjugate base is a weak base. So the pH can be found via the Kb approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. Oh wait, but sodium acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so the pH should be less than 7 because it's a weak base. So at around 5.13 pH, which is option G: 5.3 is close, but wait, wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate Kb. Wait, Ka = 1.8e-5, Kw =1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = 5.555e-10. Correct.

So [H+] = sqrt(5.555e-10 * 0.10) = sqrt(5.555e-11)= approx 7.45e-6. So pH is -log(7.45e-6) = 5.13.

So which option is closest to 5.13? The options are A:8.9, B:4.8, C:3.9, D:11.2, E:7.5, F:10.1, G:5.3, H:9.3, I:6.2, J:9.7.

Ah, none of the options are exactly 5.13. So the closest option is G:5.3, which is 0.17 higher. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the pH more accurately.

Let me compute [H+] exactly.

Kb = 5.555e-10. C = 0.10 → x^2 = Kb * C = 5.555e-10 *0.10 = 5.555e-11. So x = sqrt(5.555e-11) = √(5.555e-11) = approximately 7.45e-6. So pH is -log(7.45e-6) = 5.13.

But looking at the options, the closest is option G:5.3. Hmm, but that's off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is 5.1, which isn't an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should have considered the hydrolysis of acetate as a weak acid. Wait, I'm confused. Wait, acetate is a base, so the solution is basic. So the pH should be below 7.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for pH of a salt of a weak acid. The formula for weak acid's salt (a weak base) is pH = pKa + (pH of the conjugate acid) or something else? Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for a salt solution.

Alternatively, the formula for pH of a weak base's solution is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, another approach: for a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, like NaAc, the solution is basic. The pH can be found using the formula pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but wait, acetic acid (weak acid) and sodium acetate (its conjugate base). So the formula for the pH is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but wait, in this case, the acid is acetic acid, and the conjugate base is acetate. The formula is typically used for the solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

But that's for a weak acid and its conjugate base. Hmm, but wait, in this case, the solution is of the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So when the acetate ion is in solution, it can act as a base. So perhaps the correct equation is pH = pKa + log([Ac^-]/[H+]).

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, acetic acid dissociates as CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-. The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is a weak base, which reacts with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ H+ + CH3COOH.

So the pH is determined by the concentration of H+ ions produced by the hydrolysis of acetate. The formula for the pH of a solution of a weak base is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation: pH = pKa + log ( [base] / [acid] ). Wait, but in this case, the solution is the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the acid is acetic acid, and the base is acetate. So the formula would be pH = pKa + log ([base] / [acid]).

Wait, but in this case, the acid is acetic acid, and the base is acetate. So the equation would be pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]), where [base] is acetate (0.10 M) and [acid] is acetic acid (0.10 M as well, because it's a 0.10 M solution). So [base]/[acid] = 1. So log(1) is zero. So pH = pKa → which is 4.74? But wait, that can't be right, because the solution is a weak base and the pH should be below 7.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if [base] = [acid], then the log is zero, so pH = pKa. But that doesn't make sense because acetic acid is a weak acid, so the solution should be basic. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this equation wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a salt: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but I'm not getting the right answer. Let me think again. Another approach: the solution is a weak base—so the pH can be calculated using the Kb expression.

We have Kb = 5.555e-10. So the concentration of H+ is x, and the initial concentration of acetate is 0.10 M. So the equation is Kb = x^2 / (0.10 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.10 because x is small.

So x^2 ≈ 5.555e-10 * 0.10 = 5.555e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(5.555e-11) = approx 7.45e-6 M. So [H+] =7.45e-6 → pH is -log(7.45e-6).

Calculating that: log(7.45) is about 0.872. So 10^(-6 + 0.872) → 10^(-5.128) → pH is 5.128.

So the pH is approximately 5.13. But looking at the options, the closest is G:5.3 or F:10.1.

Wait, none of the options are exactly 5.13. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Maybe the formula should be pH = pKa + log(c) + something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula for the pH of a weak base, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Wait, no, that would still give 4.74, which is too high.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for the pH of a weak base. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, that's what I thought earlier, but when [base] = [acid], it gives pH = pKa. But when the concentration of the base is 0.10 M, and the acid is also 0.10 M, that would give pH = pKa.

Wait, but in reality, since the acetic acid is weak, the solution is slightly basic. So perhaps the issue is the assumption that [acid] is 0.10 M. Wait, because in the solution, the acetate ion comes from the dissociation of acetic acid. So the concentration of acetic acid is 0.10 M, and the acetate is also 0.10 M.

Wait, so in the formula, the base is acetate (0.10 M), and the acid is acetic acid (0.10 M). So [base]/[acid] = 1. So pH = pKa + log(1) = pKa → 4.74. But that's incorrect because the solution is a weak base, not a weak acid.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the hydroxide ions. Because the solution is a weak base, the pH can be found using the Kb expression. Alternatively, using the Kb and the concentration.

Wait another approach: the formula for a weak base's solution is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but wait, that's for a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, no. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the pH of a solution of a weak base, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]), but that only holds when [base] = [acid], which isn't the case here as in our problem.

Wait, perhaps I should stick with the initial approach: compute [H+] as sqrt(Kb * C) and then compute pH.

Wait, let me compute [H+] more accurately. Kb =5.555e-10, C=0.10.

x^2 = 5.555e-10 * 0.10 =5.555e-11.

x = sqrt(5.555e-11) = 7.454e-6.

So [H+] is 7.454e-6. pH is -log(7.454e-6).

Log(7.454) is approximately 0.872. So log(7.454e-6) = 0.872 -6 = -5.128. So pH is 5.128.

So the pH is approximately 5.13. Looking at the options, the closest is option G:5.3, but that's a bit higher.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of Kb. Let me double-check that.

Ka = 1.8e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = 5.555...e-10. Correct.

So [H+] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.555e-10 * 0.10) = sqrt(5.555e-11) = 7.45e-6.

So pH is 5.13. None of the options match this exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the acetate ion as the base and used the Kb expression correctly. So perhaps the equation is correctly set, but I miscalculated the Kb.

Wait, let me recompute Kb. Ka = 1.8e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka =1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = 1/(1.8e5) * 1e-9 = (1/180000) * 1e-9= 5.555e-10. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps when the concentration of the acid and the base are the same, we can't use that formula. For example, in the formula pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]), when [base] = [acid], pH = pKa, which doesn't account for the hydrolysis. So perhaps I should use the exact equation for a weak base.

The exact equation for pH of a weak base is pH = pKa + log( [base]/[acid] ) + ... but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula for a weak base, the pH can be calculated using the formula pH = pKa + log( [base]/[acid] ) + (something else). I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]) + (something else). But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in reverse. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

But in our case, [base] is 0.10 M and [acid] is 0.10 M → so log(1) =0, so pH = pKa =4.74. But that's incorrect because the solution is a weak base, not a weak acid.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula for a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, which would be pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but no, that's incorrect. Because the formula pKa + log([base]/[acid]) is only valid for a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base. In our case, the solution is a weak base, so that formula doesn't apply.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The solution is a salt of acetic acid (a weak acid) and sodium (a strong base). So the acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the solution is a weak base, so the pH can be calculated using the Kb expression.

The Kb is 5.555e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.10 M. So the equation to find the [H+] is Kb = [H+][A-]/(C), where C is the concentration of the weak acid (acetic acid) and [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate). Since in our case, the acid and its conjugate base have the same concentration (both 0.10 M), the [H+] = sqrt(Kb * C) = 7.45e-6 M. So pH is 5.13.

But looking at the options, the closest is option G:5.3. So perhaps the correct answer is option G:5.3. But why is this not matching?

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the solution is a weak base, and the pH is given by pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Which would give pH = 4.74 + log(1) =4.74. But this is incorrect because the solution is a weak base, not a weak acid, and the pH should be less than 7.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me re-calculate the Kb:

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = (1/1.8) * 1e-9 → 5.5555...e-10. So yes.

So [H+] is 7.45e-6. pH is 5.13.

But the options don't have 5.13 as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option G:5.3. But I'm not sure why that is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for a salt of a weak base and a strong acid, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

Wait, but in our case, the base is the conjugate base of acetic acid, and the acid is acetic acid. So [base] = 0.10 M, [acid] =0.10 M.

So pH = pKa + log(1) = pKa → 4.74. But this is incorrect because the solution is a weak base, not a weak acid.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

But in our case, that would give pH =4.74. But that's not correct, because the solution is a weak base and should have a pH less than 7.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula pH = pKa + log([base]^2 / (C * Kb)).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to find the pH using the Kb expression.

So Kb = 5.555e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.10 M.

The equation is Kb = (x^2)/(0.10 -x). Since x is likely much smaller than 0.10, x^2 is negligible compared to 0.10. So 5.555e-10 ≈ x^2 / 0.10 → x^2 ≈5.555e-10 * 0.10 →5.555e-11 →x ≈7.45e-6.

So [H+] is 7.45e-6, pH is 5.13.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct answer is option G:5.3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the pH more accurately.

Let me compute [H+] as sqrt(5.555e-10 *0.10) = sqrt(5.555e-11) =7.453e-6.

So pH is -log(7.453e-6) → let's compute that.

Log(7.453e-6) = log(7.453) + log(1e-6) = 0.872 + (-6) = -5.128.

So pH =5.128 → approximately 5.13.

But the options don't have 5.13. So perhaps the correct answer is option G:5.3, but I'm not confident in that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. Maybe using the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

But in our case, [base] = [acid], so pH = pKa → 4.74. But this is incorrect because the solution is a weak base, not a weak acid.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option G:5.3, which is the closest to 5.13. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka =1.8e-5 → Kb =1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = (1/1.8) * 1e-9 → 5.555e-10.

Yes, correct.

So, the correct pH is approximately 5.13. But looking at the options, the closest is option G:5.3. So perhaps the correct answer is option G:5.3.

But I'm not entirely sure, because the exact calculation gives 5.13, which is closer to option G:5.3 than to option F:10.1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the solution is a weak base, and the pH can be found using the formula pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

But in our case, [base] = [acid], so pH = pKa →4.74. But this is incorrect, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is pH = pKa + log( [base] / [acid] ) + something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is pH = pKa + log( [base] / [acid] ) + (something else).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is pH = pKa + log( [base]/[acid] ) + log( [base]/[acid] ) → but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula pH = pKa + log( [base]/[acid] ) + (something else). I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem in terms of the pH of a solution of a weak base. The formula for the pH of a weak base is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

But in our case, [base] = [acid]. So pH = pKa →4.74, which is incorrect because the solution is a weak base, not a weak acid.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to proceed with the calculation I have and see which option is closest.

So, according to my calculation, the pH is approximately 5.13. The closest option is G:5.3. So perhaps the correct answer is G:5.3.

Alternatively, perhaps option F:10.1 is correct if the solution were a weak acid. But in our case, the solution is a weak base, so pH should be less than 7.

So, I think the correct answer is G:5.3.
</think>

The problem involves calculating the pH of a 0.10 M solution of sodium acetate (NaOAc), where acetate (CH3COO⁻) is the conjugate base of acetic acid (CH3COOH). The equilibrium for this system is governed by the dissociation of acetic acid:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is given by the acid dissociation constant (\(K_a\)):

\[
K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}
\]

The conjugate base of acetic acid is acetate, and the equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of acetate (the reaction:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}^+ \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}
\]

is given by the base dissociation constant (\(K_b\)):

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.555 \times 10^{-10}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \([H^+]\)
The concentration of acetate (\([A^-]\)) is 0.10 M, and the concentration of acetic acid (\([HA]\)) is also 0.10 M (since acetic acid is a weak acid). Using the equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis of acetate:

\[
K_b = \frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5.555 \times 10^{-10} = \frac{[H^+](0.10)}{0.10}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
[H^+] = \sqrt{5.555 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.10} = \sqrt{5.555 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 7.45 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the pH
The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log_{10}([H^+]) = -\log_{10}(7.45 \times 10^{-6})
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
\log_{10}(7.45 \times 10^{-6}) = \log_{10}(7.45) + \log_{10}(10^{-6}) = 0.872 - 6 = -5.128
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = -(-5.128) = 5.13
\]

### Step 3: Compare with the Options
The calculated pH is approximately 5.13. Among the given options:

- **Option G: 5.3** is the closest to the calculated value.
- **Option F: 10.1** is incorrect because the pH is less than 7 for a weak base.
- **Option H: 9.9** is also incorrect.

### Conclusion
The pH of the 0.10 M sodium acetate solution is approximately 5.13, and the closest option is **G: 5.3**.

ANSWER: G
