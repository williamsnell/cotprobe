Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about dividing a line segment into two parts by choosing a random point. The question is asking for the probability that the longer segment is at least two times longer than the shorter one. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that when we randomly pick a point on a line segment, it's like choosing a random point along the length. Let's imagine the segment is from 0 to 1 for simplicity. So any point x between 0 and 1 will divide the segment into two parts: x and 1-x. 

Now, the problem is about one part being at least twice as long as the other. So, if the longer segment is at least twice as long as the shorter one, that means the longer segment must be >= 2*(shorter segment). Since the total length is 1, the longer segment is either x or 1-x, whichever is bigger. So, let's think about both possibilities.

Let’s say x is the shorter segment. Then the longer segment is 1-x. For the longer to be at least twice the shorter, 1-x >= 2x. Solving for x: 1 >= 3x → x <= 1/3. So, if x is less than or equal to 1/3, then 1-x is longer and is at least twice as long as x.

Alternatively, if x is the longer segment, then x >= 2*(1-x), which would mean x >= 2/3. So, in this case, x has to be greater than or equal to 2/3. 

So the favorable cases are when x is in [0, 1/3] or [2/3, 1]. Wait, but wait, if x is in [0,1/3], then 1-x is longer and >= 2x. And if x is in [2/3,1], then x is longer than 1-x, and since x >= 2/3, 1-x <= 1/3, which is less than x. So in both cases, the longer segment is at least twice the shorter one.

But wait, actually, in the first case, when x is in [0, 1/3], the longer segment is 1-x, which is 1 to 2/3. So 1-x is from 2/3 to 1. So when x is in [0,1/3], 1-x is in [2/3,1], which is longer than x (which is in [0,1/3]). So 1-x is >=2x only when x <=1/3.

Similarly, when x is in [2/3,1], then the longer segment is x, which is >=2/3, and the shorter is 1-x, which is <=1/3. So x >=2/3 implies that x >= 2*(1-x). Because 2*(1-x) = 2 - 2x. So x >= 2 - 2x → 3x >=2 → x>=2/3. So yes, that works.

So the favorable x's are [0,1/3] and [2/3,1]. The total length is 1/3 +1/3 =2/3. So the probability is 2/3.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because when you choose a random point on the line segment, every point has an equal chance. So the probability is the length of the favorable regions divided by the total length. The favorable regions are [0,1/3] and [2/3,1], each of length 1/3. So total favorable length is 2/3. The total possible is 1. So the probability is 2/3.

But let me visualize this. Imagine the line from 0 to 1. The point x can be anywhere. When x is between 0 and 1/3, the longer segment is 1-x, which is from 2/3 to 1. So 1-x is definitely longer than x, which is up to 1/3. So in that case, the longer is at least twice the shorter. Similarly, when x is between 2/3 and 1, the longer is x, which is at least 2/3, and the shorter is 1-x, which is at most 1/3. So x is at least 2*(1-x), which holds because x >=2*(1-x) → 3x >=2 → x>=2/3.

So the favorable intervals are 0 to 1/3 and 2/3 to 1, each of length 1/3. So total favorable is 2*(1/3) =2/3. So the probability is 2/3.

But wait, wait. Let me think about the probabilities. The point is chosen uniformly at random. So the probability is the measure of the favorable intervals divided by the total. So yes, 2/3.

Looking back at the options, option E is 2/3. So the answer should be E.

The probability that the longer segment is at least twice as long as the shorter segment is calculated by considering the intervals where this condition holds. When the point x is in [0, 1/3] or [2/3, 1], the longer segment is at least twice the shorter. Each interval has a length of 1/3, so the total favorable length is 2/3. Since the total possible length is 1, the probability is 2/3.
