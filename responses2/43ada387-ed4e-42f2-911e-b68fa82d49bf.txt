Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the kinetic energy of a car. Let me think.

The car weighs 2000 pounds and is moving at 50 miles per hour. I need to find its kinetic energy in both Joules and ergs. Hmm, right, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But wait, the units here are in pounds and miles, so I probably need to convert them to kilograms and meters per second.

Wait, wait. I remember that in physics, we usually use SI units, so kilograms and meters. So I'll have to convert pounds to kilograms and miles per hour to meters per second.

First, let's convert the weight from pounds to kilograms. I know that 1 pound is approximately 0.453592 kilograms. So 2000 pounds times 0.453592 kg/lb. Let me calculate that. 2000 * 0.453592 equals... 2000 * 0.453592 is 907.184 kg. Okay, so m equals approximately 907.184 kg.

Next, the speed is 50 miles per hour. I need to convert this to meters per second. How do I do that? 

Let's break it down. First, miles to kilometers: 1 mile is 1.60934 kilometers. So 50 miles is 50 * 1.60934 km. Let me compute that. 50 * 1.60934 is 80.467 km. 

Now, kilometers to meters: 1 km is 1000 meters, so 80.467 km is 80,467 meters.

Now, hours to seconds. 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So to find meters per second, speed in km/h divided by 3.6 (since 3.6 km/h is 1 m/s). So 80467 m / 3600 s. Let's compute that division. 

Divide 80467 by 3600. Let's see, 80467 ÷ 3600 is approximately 22.3519 m/s. So v is about 22.35 m/s.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check these calculations. Oh no, wait, I think I made a mistake in the division. 3600 goes into 80467 how many times?

Alternatively, maybe I should use the factor to convert mph to m/s directly. I remember that 1 mph is 0.44704 m/s. So 50 mph times 0.44704 equals the speed in m/s.

Calculating that: 50 * 0.44704 is 22.352 m/s. Yeah, that matches what I got earlier. So v is 22.352 m/s.

Now, kinetic energy is ½ mv². So let's compute that.

First, ½ of 907.184 kg is 453.592 kg.

Then, v squared is (22.352)^2. Let me calculate that. 22.35 squared is approximately, let's compute:

22^2 is 484. Then 0.35^2 is 0.1225. And the cross term is 2*22*0.35 = 15.4. So (22 + 0.35)^2 = 484 + 15.4 + 0.1225 = 500 approximately. Wait, but exact calculation would be better.

22.352 * 22.352: Let me compute 22 * 22 = 484, 22 * 0.352 = 7.744, 0.352 * 22 = 7.744, and 0.352^2 is about 0.1239.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute 22.352 squared:

Breaking down:
(22 + 0.352)^2 = 22^2 + 2*22*0.352 + 0.352^2
22² is 484
2*22*0.352 = 44 * 0.352 = 44 * 0.35 is 15.4, and 44 * 0.002 is 0.088, so 15.488
0.352^2: 0.352 * 0.352 = 0.123904
Adding all together: 484 + 15.488 = 499.488; plus 0.123904 is approximately 500. (Wait, 484 + 15.488 is 499.488, plus 0.123904 is 499.611904. So v² is around 499.61 m²/s².)

Wait, but 22.352^2 is actually 499.61 m²/s². Hmm, let me check with a calculator.

Alternatively, 22.352 * 22.352. Let me compute:

22.352 * 22.352:

Let me compute 22.352 * 20 = 447.04.

22.352 * 2.352 = ?

Wait, it's easier to break it down as 22.352 * (22 + 0.352) = 22.352 * 22 + 22.352 * 0.352.

22.352 *22: Let's compute 22 *22=484, 22 *0.352=7.744. So 22.352*22=484 +7.744=491.744.

22.352 *0.352: Let's compute 22 *0.352=7.744; 0.352 *0.352=0.123904. Wait, no, 0.352 * 22.352 is 7.744 + 0.123904 = 7.867904. No, that approach is confusing. Alternatively, 22.352 *0.352 = (22 + 0.352) *0.352 = 22*0.352 + 0.352*0.352.

22 *0.352 is 7.744, and 0.352 *0.352 is 0.123904. So 7.744 + 0.123904 = 7.867904.

So the total 22.352 * 22.352 is 491.744 + 7.867904 = 499.611904 m²/s².

So v squared is approximately 499.6119 m²/s².

Now, kinetic energy is 0.5 * m * v². So:

0.5 * 907.184 kg * 499.6119 m²/s².

Wait, let's compute this step by step.

First, compute 0.5 * 907.184: that's 453.592 kg.

Then multiply by v², which is 499.6119 m²/s².

So 453.592 * 499.6119.

Let me approximate this.

453.592 * 499.6119.

I can think of 499.6119 as approximately 500.

So 453.592 * 500 = 226,796. So about 226,796 J.

But because we used 499.6119 instead of 500, the actual value is a bit less. Let me compute the exact product.

Compute 453.592 * 499.6119:

We can break it down into (453.592)(500 - 0.3881).

500 is 500, so 499.6119 =500 - 0.3881.

So 453.592 *500 = 226,796.

453.592 * 0.3881 = let's compute that.

0.3 * 453.592 is 136.0776.

0.08 * 453.592 is 36.28736.

0.0081 * 453.592 is approximately 3.6659 (since 453.592 *0.008 =3.6287, and 0.0001 is 0.045359, so 0.0081 is approx 3.6287 + 0.045359 = 3.67406).

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Compute 453.592 * 0.3881.

Let me break 0.3881 into 0.3 + 0.08 + 0.008 + 0.0001.

So:

0.3 *453.592 = 136.0776

0.08 *453.592 = 36.28736

0.008 *453.592 = 3.628736

0.0001 *453.592 = 0.0453592

Adding all:

136.0776 +36.28736 = 172.36496

172.36496 +3.628736 = 175.993696

175.993696 +0.0453592 ≈ 176.039055.

So 453.592 * 0.3881 ≈ 176.039055.

So the total is 226,796 (from 453.592 *500) minus 176.039055.

Which gives 226,796 - 176.039055 = 226,619.960945.

So approximately 226,620 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the 1e5 range. So 2.27e5 J, which is 227,000 J. So that's close to our calculation of 226,620 J. So that's about 2.27e5 J.

Now, for the ergs. Because 1 joule is 10^7 ergs. So 226,620 J is 2.2662e5 J. To convert to ergs, multiply by 1e7.

So 2.2662e5 J * 1e7 erg/J = 2.2662e12 erg.

Looking at the options, option C says 2.0e5 J and 2.0e12 ergs. Hmm, but our calculation is about 2.26e5 J and 2.27e12 ergs. So that's option G: 2.27e5 J and 2.27e12 ergs. But wait, our calculation is 2.27e5 J and 226,620 J. 226,620 J is about 2.2662e5, which is approximately 2.27e5. So option G says 2.27e5 J, ergs 2.27e12.

Wait, but wait. Wait let me double-check all the steps for any miscalculations.

Wait, the mass was 2000 pounds. Let me recalculate that. 1 pound is 0.453592 kg. 2000 * 0.453592 = 907.184 kg. Correct.

Speed is 50 mph. Converting to m/s: 50 * 0.44704 = 22.352 m/s. Correct.

Kinetic energy: 0.5 * m * v².

m =907.184 kg, v²= (22.352)^2=499.6119 m²/s².

So 0.5 * 907.184 =453.592

453.592 *499.6119≈226,620 J. Which is approximately 2.27e5 J.

Ergs: 1 J = 1e7 ergs. So 2.27e5 J *1e7 erg/J = 2.27e12 erg.

Looking at the options, option G is 2.27e5 J and 2.27e12 ergs. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the kinetic energy of an automobile weighing 2000 pounds and moving at 50 miles per hour, we use the formula for kinetic energy:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

### Step 1: Convert units to SI
- **Weight**: 2000 pounds. Since 1 pound = 0.453592 kg,  
  \[
  m = 2000 \times 0.453592 = 907.184 \, \text{kg}.
  \]
- **Speed**: 50 miles per hour. Since 1 mile = 1609.34 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds,  
  \[
  v = 50 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} \approx 22.352 \, \text{m/s}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate kinetic energy
Using \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \):
- First, compute \( v^2 \):  
  \[
  v^2 = (22.352)^2 \approx 499.61 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
  \]
- Then, calculate \( KE \):  
  \[
  KE = 0.5 \times 907.184 \times 499.61 \approx 226,620 \, \text{J}.
  \]

### Step 3: Convert to ergs
Since 1 joule = \( 10^7 \) ergs:  
\[
KE = 226,620 \, \text{J} \times 10^7 = 2.27 \times 10^{12} \, \text{ergs}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
- **Option G**: \( 2.27 \times 10^5 \, \text{J} \) and \( 2.27 \times 10^{12} \, \text{ergs} \).  
  This matches the calculations.
