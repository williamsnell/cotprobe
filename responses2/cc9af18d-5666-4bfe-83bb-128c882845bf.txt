Okay, so I've got this logic question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about translating a sentence into a propositional logic formula. The sentence is: "A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive."

Hmm, that's a bit dense. Let me parse it carefully. The structure is something like: If [condition A], then [conclusion B]. So the person was born or died in the present year, and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive. So the entire condition is that both these things happened.

Breaking it down, the main structure is: If (Person was born or died in present year) AND (Your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive). So the entire if statement is a conjunction of two parts. That would make the implication be something like:

If (B ∨ D) and (H and D survives), then ... ?

Wait, no. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again: "if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive". So, the person was born or died in the present year (B ∨ D), and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive (H). So the entire condition is that both B ∨ D and H are true.

But the sentence says, "A person is considered to have lived..." so maybe it's saying that if both of these were true, then the person is considered to have lived with you. So the structure is: (B ∨ D) and H → L. Because L is probably the conclusion that the person is considered to have lived with you.

Wait, but the options are in terms of implications. Let me think about the logical structure. The sentence is saying that the condition (B ∨ D) and H leads to L. So in logic terms, it's (B ∨ D) ∧ H → L.

But none of the options seem to directly present this. Let me look at the options.

Option A: H ⊃ [(B ∨ D) • L] → This would mean that if H, then (B∨D ∧ L). That doesn't seem right because H is the home being this person's home for the entire time, which is part of the condition. But I'm not sure how that translates.

Option B: (L ∨ B) • (D ⊃ H) → Wait, that's an AND between two terms, so (L ∨ B) and (D → H). Or is that a conjunction? Wait, let's see. It's written as (L ∨ B) • (D ⊃ H). So in logic, this is (L ∨ B) ∧ (D → H). So if either L or B is true, and if D implies H, then the entire thing is true. But I'm not sure if that's the correct structure.

Option C: [L ⊃ (B ∨ D)] • H → So L implies (B or D), and H. So L→(B∨D) and H. Not sure. But the way this is structured, it's H being a separate part. Wait, the original condition is (B∨D) and H leading to L, but here H is just a separate premise. So maybe that's not the right way.

Option D: (B ∨ D) ⊃ (H • L) → So if B∨D is true, then H and L are both true. That seems to fit. Because it's saying, if the person was born or died in the present (B∨D), then both their home (H) and the person being considered (L) are true.

Wait, but the sentence says that the person was born or died in the present year, and your home was this person's home for the entire time. So the condition is (B∨D) and H. So the implication would be that if (B∨D) and H, then L. Which is exactly what option D says: (B∨D) → (H ∧ L).

Wait, but the structure in the options is a bit different. Option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). So yes, that's correct.

Now, looking at the other options. Let me see:

Option E: L ⊃ (B ∨ D • H) → This would be L → (B∨D ∧ H), which is similar to option D but with L implying the conjunction. Not exactly the same.

Option F: [(B ∨ D) • H] ⊃ L → So (B∨D ∧ H) → L. That's saying if both B∨D and H are true, then L is true. But the original condition is B∨D and H leading to L. So this would be equivalent to (B∨D ∧ H) → L, which is the same as option D's structure. So this option is the same as D.

Wait, but let me think again. The sentence is about whether the person is considered to have lived with you. So the main part is whether (B∨D ∧ H) → L. So option F is [(B ∨ D) • H] → L, which is the same as (B∨D ∧ H) → L. So same as option D.

Wait, but option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). Which is the same as (B∨D ∧ H) → L, because implication is right-associative? No, not exactly. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, (A → (B ∧ C)) is equivalent to (A ∧ ¬B) ∨ (A ∧ ¬C) ∨ (B ∧ C). Similarly, (B ∧ C) → A is equivalent to (¬B ∨ ¬C) ∨ A.

Wait, but in terms of structure, (B∨D) → (H ∧ L) is like saying if B∨D is true, then both H and L must be true. So that's correct.

Now, looking at the options, option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). So that's option D.

But wait, option F is [(B ∨ D) • H] → L. Which is (B∨D ∧ H) → L. Which is the same as (B∨D) → (H ∧ L), since H ∧ L is the same as L ∧ H.

Wait, but in logic, implication is left-associative. So (A → B → C) is same as (A → (B → C)), but (A → B) → C is different. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the way it's written matters. Let me think again.

The structure in option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). So if the person was born or died in the present (B∨D), then both their home (H) and being considered (L) are true. That's exactly what the sentence says. So option D's formula is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the original sentence. It says: "if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive, then the person is considered to have lived with you."

So, the condition is (B∨D) ∧ H. So the implication is (B∨D) ∧ H → L. Which is option D.

Wait, but looking at option F: [(B ∨ D) • H] → L. So (B∨D ∧ H) → L. Which is the same as (B∨D) ∧ H → L.

Which is the same as option D's (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). Because in both cases, if B∨D is true, then H and L must be true. So both options D and F seem to be structurally correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the structure.

Wait, no. Let me think about the implications.

Option D: (B∨D) → (H ∧ L) → If B∨D, then both H and L are true.

Option F: (B∨D ∧ H) → L → If both B∨D and H are true, then L is true. So this is asserting that H and B∨D together imply L.

Wait, but in the sentence, it's (B∨D) AND H leading to L. So it's saying that if B∨D and H are both true, then L is true. So in this case, both H and (B∨D) are needed, but the formula in F only requires that both are true, leading to L.

Wait, but in logic, (A ∧ B) → C is equivalent to (A → (B → C)). So option F would be equivalent to (B∨D ∧ H) → L, which is the same as (B∨D → H) ∧ (B∨D → L). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, no, (A ∧ B) → C is equivalent to (A → (B → C)). So in option F, (B∨D ∧ H) → L is equivalent to (B∨D → (H → L)). Because (A ∧ B) → C is same as A → (B → C).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me take it step by step.

The correct translation is: if (person was born or died in present year) AND (your home was their home for the entire time) then they are considered to have lived with you. So the structure is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is exactly option F. Because option F is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Wait, no. Looking at the options again:

Option F: [(B ∨ D) • H] ⊃ L → which is (B∨D ∧ H) → L. Which is the same as (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

So option F is correct.

But wait, let's check all the options again.

Option D: (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). So if B∨D, then both H and L. Which is the same as the original statement.

Option F: (B∨D ∧ H) → L → which is the same as H ∧ (B∨D) → L, which is the same as (B∨D ∧ H) → L, which is the same as option D.

Wait, no. Because (B∨D) → (H ∧ L) is equivalent to (B∨D ∧ ¬H) → ¬L. Because implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's take another approach. Let's think about what each option represents.

The original statement is: If (B∨D) and H, then L.

So, in logic, this is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Looking at the options:

Option F: (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is exactly the same as the original statement. So option F is correct.

Wait, but wait. Looking back, option F is [(B ∨ D) • H] ⊃ L. Which is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

So yes, that's correct.

But earlier I thought option D was correct. What's the issue here?

Wait, perhaps option D is also correct. Let me compare option D and F.

Option D: (B∨D) → (H ∧ L) → which is equivalent to (B∨D → H) ∧ (B∨D → L), but that might not be the same as (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Wait, no. Let me think. The correct translation is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). Which is equivalent to (B∨D ∧ ¬(H ∧ L)) → ... which doesn't match the original.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think in terms of the original statement.

Original statement: If (B∨D) and H, then L.

So, in logic: (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is the same as (B∨D → (H → L)).

Wait, but none of the options present that exactly.

Wait, let's look at option F again. Option F is (B∨D ∧ H) → L → which is (B∨D ∧ H) → L, which is the same as option D's (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). No, wait: No, because D is (B∨D) implies (H ∧ L), while F is (B∨D ∧ H) implies L.

Wait, are these the same?

Wait, (B∨D) → (H ∧ L) is equivalent to (B∨D ∧ ¬(H ∧ L)) → ... which is the same as (B∨D ∧ ¬H ∨ ¬L) → ... which is more complicated.

Alternatively, (B∨D) → (H ∧ L) is equivalent to (B∨D ∧ ¬H) → ¬L.

But option F is (B∨D ∧ H) → L, which is (B∨D ∧ H) → L, which is the same as (B∨D ∧ H ∧ ¬L) → ... which is different.

So perhaps neither option D nor F is correct. That can't be right. Maybe I should think again.

Wait, wait. Maybe the structure is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L), which is how option D is written. So this would mean that if B∨D is true, then both H and L are true. Which is exactly the original statement.

But looking at option F, it's (B∨D ∧ H) → L. Which is different. So option D is correct.

Wait, but option F says that if both B∨D and H are true, then L is true. Which is the same as option D's (B∨D) → (H ∧ L), because the 'and' is commutative. So option D and F are equivalent? That can't be, because they are structurally different.

Wait, no. Because option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L), which is (B∨D) → H ∧ (B∨D) → L. Whereas option F is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Wait, but (B∨D ∧ H) is the same as (B∨D) ∧ H. So option F is (A ∧ B) → C, which is the same as A → (B → C). So option F would be (B∨D) → (H → L). Which is a different structure.

Wait, so option F is (B∨D ∧ H) → L, which is the same as (B∨D) ∧ H → L, which is the same as (B∨D) → (H → L). So that's different from option D.

So perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The original statement is (B∨D ∧ H) → L. So in terms of implication, that's (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

But none of the options present that. So perhaps the correct option is F, because perhaps the way the options are written, option F is the same as the original.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each option.

Option D: (B∨D) → (H ∧ L) → So if the person was born or died in present, then both H and L are true.

Option F: (B∨D ∧ H) → L → So if both (B∨D) and H are true, then L is true.

But the original statement says that if (B∨D) and H, then L.

So, the correct translation is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is option F.

But earlier I thought option D is correct. Now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the structure. Let's think about what each option represents.

Option D: (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). So it's saying that if B∨D is true, then both H and L are true.

But the original statement is that if (B∨D and H), then L. So it's a one-way implication: the conjunction of (B∨D and H) leads to L.

So, the original is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L), which is a different implication. It doesn't capture the same structure as the original.

Wait, but if I have (B∨D ∧ H) → L, does that mean that if either B∨D is true and H is true, then L is true. That's exactly what the original statement says.

So option F is correct.

Wait, but the original statement is: If (B∨D) and H, then L. Which is (B∨D ∧ H) → L. So F is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think of it as a truth table.

Original statement: (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

So, for all possible truth values of B, D, H, L.

The only time the implication fails is when (B∨D ∧ H) is true, but L is false.

So, the correct formula is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Looking at the options, option F is (B∨D ∧ H) → L. So correct.

But option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). Let me see if that's the same as option F.

No, because option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L), which is a different structure. It's saying if B∨D is true, then both H and L are true.

Which is different from option F, which only requires that both H and B∨D are true.

Wait, no. Because option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L). So if B∨D is true, then H and L must also be true. Which is the same as the original statement.

Wait, because the original statement is (B∨D ∧ H) → L. Which is the same as (B∨D) → (H ∧ L).

So both D and F seem to be correct. But that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing a key aspect.

Wait, perhaps option D is not correct because it's using '→' instead of '→ ∧'.

Wait, no, no, no. The correct structure is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is the same as (B∨D) → (H ∧ L), which is option D.

But option F is (B∨D ∧ H) → L. Which is the same as (B∨D ∧ H) → L. So they're the same because the antecedent is the same.

Wait, no. Wait, (B∨D ∧ H) is the same as (B∨D) ∧ H. So option F is the same as option D, because both are (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because (B∨D) ∧ H is the same as (B∨D ∧ H), which is the same as (B∨D ∧ H). So both options D and F are the same. So why is this a problem?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the translation. Let me think again.

The original statement: If (B∨D) and H, then L.

So, (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is exactly option F.

Wait, but I thought option D was correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the options. Let me list them again.

Option A: H ⊃ [(B ∨ D) • L]

Option B: (L ∨ B) • (D ⊃ H)

Option C: [L ⊃ (B ∨ D)] • H

Option D: (B ∨ D) ⊃ (H ∧ L)

Option E: L ⊃ (B ∨ D • H)

Option F: (B ∨ D) • H ⊃ L

Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Option F: [(B ∨ D) • H] ⊃ L → which is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is the same as option D's (B∨D) → (H ∧ L).

So, both D and F are correct.

But that can't be, because the options are designed to have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think about the original sentence again.

The sentence is: If (person was born or died in present year) AND (your home was their home for the entire time), then they are considered to have lived with you.

So, the structure is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is exactly option F.

But option D is (B∨D) → (H ∧ L), which is the same as (B∨D ∧ H) → L, because implication is left-associative.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because (B∨D) → (H ∧ L) is equivalent to (B∨D) ∧ ¬(H ∧ L) → ¬(H ∧ L). Which is not the same as (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.

The correct formula is (B∨D ∧ H) → L.

Which is exactly option F.

So the correct answer is F.
</think>

The correct symbolization is option F, which accurately represents the logical structure of the sentence.
