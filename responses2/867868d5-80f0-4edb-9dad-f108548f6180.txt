Okay, so I need to figure out the largest order of an element in the group of permutations of 5 objects. Hmm, I remember that the symmetric group Sₙ has elements called permutations, and the order of a permutation is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its cycles. So, for S₅, we're looking at all possible ways to arrange 5 objects and find the permutation which has the highest order.

Wait, what's the order of a permutation again? Oh right, the order is the smallest positive integer m such that the permutation raised to the m-th power is the identity. And that's equivalent to the LCM of the lengths of its cycles. So, if a permutation has cycles of lengths that are coprime, their LCM is their product. For example, a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle would have an order of 6.

So the problem is to find the maximum LCM of any possible cycle decomposition of 5 elements. Since all elements are being permuted, the sum of the cycle lengths must be 5. We need to find the combination of integers that add up to 5 and have the highest possible LCM.

Let me think about the possible ways to partition 5 into integers:

1. 5 itself: a single 5-cycle. The LCM is 5.
2. 4 + 1: A 4-cycle and a fixed point. The LCM is LCM(4,1) = 4.
3. 3 + 2: A 3-cycle and a 2-cycle. LCM(3,2) = 6.
4. 3 + 1 + 1: A 3-cycle and two fixed points. LCM(3,1,1) = 3.
5. 2 + 2 + 1: Two 2-cycles and a fixed point. LCM(2,2,1) = 2.
6. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1: A 2-cycle and three fixed points. LCM is 2.
7. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1: Five fixed points. LCM is 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if there are other combinations. Oh, wait, I forgot the 5-cycle is 5. Then 3 and 2 is 6, which is higher. So the maximum would be 6?

Wait, but I thought the maximum was 12. Oh wait, maybe I missed a combination. Let me think again.

Wait, another possible partition is 3 + 2 = 5. So that's a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, which gives LCM(3,2) = 6. But wait, is there a way to get a higher LCM? For example, what about a 4-cycle and a 1-cycle? That would be LCM(4,1) =4. No, that's lower than 6. What about a 5-cycle, which is 5, which is less than 6.

Wait, what about a 4-cycle and a 1-cycle. Oh, I think I covered that. How about 3 and 2? Yes, that's 6. What about 5 itself? 5. So 6 is higher than 5. But wait, am I missing a better combination?

Wait another thought: wait, can I have a 5-cycle? That's 5. But what about a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle? Yes, that's 6. But wait, could there be a higher LCM? Let me think. Let's see: maybe 2 and 3, which is 6. What about 2,2,1. That's 2. 3,2: 6. 4,1:4. How about a 5-cycle and a 1-cycle? It's 5. 5 is less than 6.

Wait, what about a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle, which is 6. But wait, is that the only way? What about a 4-cycle and a 1-cycle? 4, which is less than 6. So 6 is higher.

So the maximum order is 6. But wait the options don't have 6 as an option. Wait, wait, no, the options are A:20, B:25, C:10, D:6, E:7, F:12, G:30, H:11, I:5, J:15.

Wait, I thought that the maximum was 6, but that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because I think I might have forgotten some partitions. Oh wait, another possible combination is a 5-cycle, which is 5, a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle (6), or a 4-cycle and a 1-cycle (4), or a 3-cycle and two 1-cycles (3), a 2-cycle and three 1-cycles (2), etc.

Wait, what about a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle? That's 6 which is the same as before. So the maximum is 6.

But wait, I remember that the symmetric group Sₙ can have elements with order equal to the LCM of the cycle lengths. So for n=5, the maximum LCM is 6. That would make the maximum order 6.

But wait, looking back at the options, the largest order is option D:6. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait—I'm getting confused because the options don't have 6 as an option, but wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, no, the options are: A:20, B:25, C:10, D:6, E:7, F:12, G:30, H:11, I:5, J:15.

So D is 6. So the correct answer is D. So the largest order is 6.
</think>

The largest order of an element in the symmetric group S₅ is determined by considering all possible cycle decompositions that sum to 5. The maximum LCM occurs for a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, which gives an order of 6. This corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
