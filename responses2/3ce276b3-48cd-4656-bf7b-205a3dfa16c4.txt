Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a child sliding a block on a kitchen floor and hitting a spring. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says the block has a mass of 2 kg, initial speed is 4 m/s, and the spring constant is 6 N/m. I need to find the maximum compression of the spring. Hmm, right. So when the block hits the spring, it's all about energy conservation, I think.

Wait, when the block comes to rest after compressing the spring, all the kinetic energy it had will be converted into elastic potential energy in the spring. So the initial kinetic energy should equal the maximum elastic potential energy.

The kinetic energy formula is (1/2)mv². Let me plug in the numbers. m is 2 kg, v is 4 m/s. So that's (1/2)*2* (4)^2. Calculating that: 1/2 of 2 is 1, 4 squared is 16. So 1 * 16 is 16 J. So the kinetic energy is 16 Joules.

Elastic potential energy is (1/2) k x², where k is the spring constant (6 N/m) and x is the compression distance we're trying to find. So setting them equal: 16 = (1/2)*6*x².

Simplify that equation. 16 = 3 x², so x² = 16/3. Taking square root, x is sqrt(16/3). Let me calculate that. 16 divided by 3 is approximately 5.333. Square root of that is about 2.309 meters. Oh wait, but wait. I'm not sure if that's right because I'm getting a value that's just under 2.3 meters.

Looking back at the options, option I is 2.3 m. So that's the answer. But wait, let's double-check. Another way, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, 16 divided by 3 is 5.333. Square root: sqrt(5.333) is indeed about 2.309, so approximately 2.3 meters. So option I is correct. Oh wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. The spring constant is 6 N/m, which is right. The mass is 2 kg, initial speed 4 m/s. Yes, the calculation seems right.

To determine the maximum compression of the spring, we use the principle of energy conservation. The initial kinetic energy of the block is entirely converted into the elastic potential energy of the spring at maximum compression. The kinetic energy is calculated as:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

Substituting the given values (\(m = 2 \, \mathrm{kg}\), \(v = 4 \, \mathrm{m/s}\)):

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2}(2)(4)^2 = 16 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

The elastic potential energy stored in the spring is given by:

\[
PE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2
\]

At maximum compression, the kinetic energy equals the spring's potential energy:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = 16
\]

Substituting \(k = 6 \, \mathrm{N/m}\):

\[
\frac{1}{2}(6)x^2 = 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3x^2 = 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = \frac{16}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \sqrt{\frac{16}{3}} \approx 2.3 \, \mathrm{m}
\]

Thus, the maximum compression of the spring is approximately \(2.3 \, \mathrm{m}\). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:
