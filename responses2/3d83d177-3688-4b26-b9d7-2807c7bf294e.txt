Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the consumer surplus when the sales level is 100. The demand function is given as p = 2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x². Hmm, consumer surplus... I remember that it's the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay when a good is bought. 

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think it involves the integral of the demand curve from zero to the quantity sold, and then subtract that integral from the total amount that consumers were willing to pay. Oh right, the formula is Consumer Surplus = ∫₀^q (p_x dx) - p(q) * q. But wait, no, wait. Actually, the integral of p(x) from 0 to q gives the total area under the demand curve, which represents the total amount consumers are willing to pay up to that quantity. Then, the consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve up to q, minus the actual payment, which is p(q) * q. 

Wait, no, wait another thing. The consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the market price line, from x=0 to x=q. Oh, right, so the correct formula is the integral from 0 to q of p(x) dx minus p(q)*q. Or is it the integral from q to P? Hmm, maybe I should get this straight. 

Wait, I think the formula is: CS = ∫₀^q (p_x dx) - p(q) * q. Alternatively, since p_x is the price at quantity x, and p(q) is the price at the specific quantity q. So the total willingness to pay is the area under the demand curve up to q, and the actual expenditure is p(q) multiplied by q. So the difference is the consumer surplus.

So first, I need to find the integral of p(x) from 0 to 100. Let me write out p(x):

p(x) = 2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x²

So the integral of p(x)dx from 0 to 100 is:

∫₀^100 (2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x²) dx

Integrating term by term:

The integral of 2000 dx is 2000x.

Integral of -0.1x dx is -0.05x².

Integral of -0.01x² dx is (-0.01)* (x³/3) = -0.003333... x³.

So putting it all together, the integral from 0 to 100 is:

[2000x - 0.05x² - 0.003333x³] evaluated from 0 to 100.

At x=100:

2000*100 = 200,000

0.05*(100)^2 = 0.05 * 10,000 = 500

0.003333*(100)^3 = 0.003333 * 1,000,000 = 3,333.333...

So subtracting:

200,000 - 500 = 199,500. Then subtract 3,333.333... gives 196,166.666...

Wait, but wait, wait: The integral is [2000x - 0.05x² - 0.003333x³] evaluated from 0 to 100. So at 100, it's 2000*100 = 200,000; minus 0.05*(100)^2 = 500; minus 0.003333*(100)^3 = 333.333. So 200,000 - 500 = 199,500; subtract 333.333 gives 199,166.666...? Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 2000*100 is 200,000.

0.05 * (100)^2 is 500.

0.003333 * 100^3 is 0.003333 * 1,000,000 = 3,333.333...

So 200,000 - 500 = 199,500. Then 199,500 - 3,333.333 = 196,166.667.

So the integral is approximately 196,166.667.

But wait, wait, let me check the integral again. Did I compute the integral correctly?

Wait, the integral is:

∫ (2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x²) dx = 2000x - (0.1/2)x² - (0.01/3)x³ + C.

So that's 2000x - 0.05x² - (0.003333)x³.

Yes, that's correct.

So evaluating from 0 to 100:

At x=100, we have 2000*100=200,000; 0.05*(100)^2=5,000; 0.003333*(100)^3=3,333.333.

So 200,000 -5,000=195,000; 195,000 -3,333.333=191,666.667.

Wait wait, is that correct? Because 0.05 * 100^2 is 0.05 * 10,000 = 500. Wait, no, 0.05 *100^2 is 0.05 *10,000=500. So the second term is 500. Then the third term is 0.003333 *100^3. 100^3 is 1e6, so 0.003333 *1e6 is 3,333.333.

So 2000x at 100 is 200,000. 0.05x² is 500. 0.003333x³ is 3333.333.

So the integral is 200,000 -500 -3333.333= 200,000 - 3833.333= 196,166.667.

Wait, that doesn't match. Because 2000x is 200,000; then subtract 0.05x² is 500, subtract 0.003333x³ is 3,333.333. So 200,000 -500 is 199,500; minus 3,333.333 is 196,166.667.

Wait but 200,000 minus 5,000 (since 0.05 *100^2 is 5,000) is 195,000. Then minus 3,333.333 is 191,666.667. Hmm, wait, am I making a mistake here?

Wait no, 0.05x² is 0.05 * 100^2 = 0.05 *10,000=5,000. Oh wait, I see, I think I made a mistake earlier. So 2000x is 200,000. Then 0.05x² is 5,000, which is subtracted. Then 0.003333x³ is 3,333.333.

So 200,000 -5,000 = 195,000. Then 195,000 -3,333.333= 191,666.667.

Wait that's correct. So the integral is approximately 191,666.667.

Now, the next part is to compute p(q) * q at q=100.

p(100) is 2000 - 0.1*100 -0.01*(100)^2.

Calculating each term:

2000 - 10 = 1990.

0.01*(100)^2 is 0.01*10,000=100. So subtract 100.

So 1990 -100= 1890. Wait, no: wait, the function is p(x)=2000 -0.1x -0.01x².

So for x=100: 2000 - (0.1*100) - (0.01*(100)^2) = 2000 -10 -100= 1890. Wait, no: 2000 -10 is 1990, minus 100 is 1890.

So p(100)=1890.

So p(q)*q is 1890 *100= 189,000.

So the consumer surplus is the integral which is 191,666.667 minus 189,000 = 2,666.667.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have anything near 2k. Looking at the options, the closest is 5500 and 7500. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the integral. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait another thing. The integral of p(x) dx from 0 to q is the total area under the curve, which is the sum of all the consumers' willingness to pay. Then, the actual expenditure is p(q)*q. So the difference is the consumer surplus, which is the area between the curve and the straight line at p(q).

Wait, but I think I might have confused the formula. The correct formula for the consumer surplus when demand is given by p(x) is:

CS = ∫₀^q p(x) dx - p(q) * q.

Wait, but wait, when p(x) is the demand curve, the integral from 0 to q of p(x) dx gives the total amount consumers are willing to pay up to q units, and the actual amount they pay is p(q) * q. So the difference is the CS.

So in this case, the integral is 191,666.667, and p(q)*q is 189,000.

So the difference is 191,666.667 -189,000 = 2,666.667. But that's way below any of the given options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the integral.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in integrating. Let me re-calculate the integral.

The integral is ∫ (2000 -0.1x -0.01x²) dx from 0 to 100.

The antiderivative is 2000x - 0.05x² - (0.01/3)x³.

Wait, 0.01/3 is approximately 0.003333333.

So at x=100, 2000*100=200,000.

0.05*(100)^2=5,000.

0.003333333*(100)^3= 0.003333333 * 1,000,000 = 3,333.333.

So 200,000 -5,000=195,000. Then subtract 3,333.333: 191,666.667.

Wait that's correct.

So the integral is 191,666.667.

p(q)*q is 189,000.

Difference is 2,666.667. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the consumer surplus is the integral from 0 to q of (p(x) - p(q)) dx? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve from 0 to q, minus the rectangle area of p(q) * q. But that's exactly what I did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in computing p(q). Let me recalculate p(100):

p =2000 -0.1 *100 -0.01*(100)^2.

0.1*100=10.

0.01*(100)^2= 0.01*10,000=100.

So 2000-10=1990. 1990-100=1890. So p(100)=1890. So p*q is 1890 *100=189,000.

So the difference is 191,666.667 - 189,000 = 2,666.667.

Hmm, that's approximately $2,666.67. But the options are all in thousands, like 5500, 7500, etc. So none match. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait—maybe I forgot to consider that the demand function is p(x) =2000 -0.1x -0.01x². So perhaps I made a mistake in the integral. Let me re-calculate the integral from 0 to 100.

The integral is [2000x -0.05x² - (0.003333)x³] from 0 to 100.

At 100, 2000*100=200,000.

0.05*(100)^2=500.

0.003333*(100)^3=3,333.333.

So 200,000 -500=199,500; 199,500 - 3,333.333=196,166.667.

Wait, wait, wait, no, that's not right. Because 2000x is 200,000; 0.05x² is 500, so 200,000 -500 =199,500. Then 199,500 - 3,333.333=196,166.667.

Ah! So the integral is 196,166.667.

Wait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, 2000x is 200,000.

Then 0.05x² is 0.05*(100)^2=500.

So 200,000 -500=199,500.

Then 0.003333333*(100)^3=3,333.333.

So 199,500 -3,333.333=196,166.667.

So the integral from 0 to 100 is 196,166.667.

Then, the total willingness to pay is 196,166.667.

The actual expenditure is p(100) * q = 1890 *100=189,000.

So the difference is 196,166.667 -189,000=7,166.667.

Ah! So that's approximately 7,166.67. Looking at the options, option C is 7166.67. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but why did I have a mistake in the integral earlier? Oh, I think I miscalculated the integral before. Correcting that, the integral is 196,166.667. So the difference (CS) is 196,166.667 - 189,000 = 7,166.667.

So the correct answer is 7,166.67, which is option C.

To find the consumer surplus when the sales level is 100, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the demand function**: The demand function is given as  
   $$ p(x) = 2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x^2 $$  

2. **Set up the integral for total willingness to pay**:  
   The total willingness to pay is the integral of the demand function from 0 to the sales level (100):  
   $$ \int_{0}^{100} (2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x^2) \, dx $$  

3. **Integrate term by term**:  
   The integral becomes:  
   $$ \left[ 2000x - 0.05x^2 - \frac{0.003333333}{1}x^3 \right]_{0}^{100} $$  

4. **Evaluate the integral at x=100**:  
   - \( 2000 \times 100 = 200,000 \)  
   - \( 0.05 \times 100^2 = 500 \)  
   - \( \frac{0.003333333}{1} \times 100^3 = 3,333.333 \)  

   So,  
   $$ 200,000 - 500 - 3,333.333 = 191,666.667 $$  

5. **Calculate the actual expenditure at x=100**:  
   $$ p(100) = 2000 - 0.1(100) - 0.01(100)^2 = 2000 - 10 - 100 = 1890 $$  
   $$ p(100) \times 100 = 1890 \times 100 = 189,000 $$  

6. **Compute the consumer surplus**:  
   Consumer surplus = Total willingness to pay - Actual expenditure  
   $$ 191,666.667 - 189,000 = 2,666.667 $$  

7. **Check for errors**:  
   Upon re-evaluating, the correct integral evaluation yields:  
   $$ 200,000 - 500 - 3,333.333 = 191,666.667 $$  
   The correct actual expenditure is:  
   $$ 1890 \times 100 = 189,000 $$  
   Thus,  
   $$ 191,666.667 - 189,000 = 2,666.667 $$  

   However, none of the provided options match this result. Re-examining the calculations, it's clear that the correct integral evaluation and subsequent calculation yield a consumer surplus of approximately **$7,166.67**.  

8. **Identify the correct option**:  
   The closest match to the calculated value of $7,166.67 is option **C: 7166.67**.
