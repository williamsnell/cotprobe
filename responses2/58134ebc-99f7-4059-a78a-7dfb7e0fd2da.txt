Question:

A state legislature has recently enacted an obscenity statute prohibiting "the selling or offering for sale of any obscene printed or video materials. " Following numerous complaints from a local citizens' group, the police entered an adult bookstore, examined materials on the shelves, and purchased magazines that depicted actual pictures of sexual intercourse. The owner was subsequently arrested and charged with violating the state obscenity law. At his trial, the owner's defense was that the sale of the materials complained of was constitutionally protected speech. Which of the following, if established, would be most helpful to the owner's defense?

Options:

A: The bookstore had a strict policy against selling to minors.
B: The particular materials involved were sold to consenting adults only.
C: The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.
D: The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.
E: The particular materials involved were part of a larger collection of non-explicit content.
F: The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.
G: The particular materials were imported and not produced in the state.
H: 85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is about a state legislature passing an obscenity statute. They're prohibiting the sale or offering for sale of any obscene printed or video materials. Then, a lot of citizens' groups complain, and the police enter an adult bookstore. They find some magazines about actual pictures of sexual intercourse, which they buy. The owner gets arrested on charges of violating the law. The owner's defense is that the sales are constitutional speech, and I have to choose which of the options would help the owner.

Hmm, what's the key here? The owner is saying that selling these materials is speech that's protected by the law. So the question is about the owner's defense against this. I remember that in the case of obscenity, the standard is that the material must be explicit and that the sale must be protected speech.

So the basic structure of an obscenity case is usually that the defendant's conduct is so explicit that it's protected by the law. The plaintiff can argue that the defendant's speech or materials are protected under the First or Fourth Amendment and that the conduct is a violation.

In this case, the owner is saying that the materials are explicit and that the sale is protected speech. So the owner wants to show that the particular materials are explicit and that the conduct is a violation of the law.

Wait, but I'm thinking about the evidence the police have. They had a strict policy against selling to minors, but that's about the store's policy, not the content of the materials. The owner is saying the materials are explicit, so maybe the store's policy doesn't preclude that.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: The bookstore had a strict policy against selling to minors. That could be a defense if the store's policy was against minors, but the owner is focusing on the content of the materials, not the store's policies. So this may not directly address the issue.

Option B: The materials were sold to consenting adults only. That seems relevant because the owner is using the fact that the materials are for adults. If the owner can show that the materials are for adults, that would support their case that the sale is protected speech. Because the statute prohibits any sale or offering for sale of any obscene materials, so any sale to adults would be protected.

Option C: The materials were serious scientific studies. I'm not sure if that's related. The statute is about "obscenity" materials, which could include anything that's explicit and might be seen as sexual. But I don't think the type of material matters for the First Amendment standards; it's about the nature of the content.

Option D: Police didn't have a search warrant. I'm not sure how this connects. The fact that they couldn't find the materials suggests they might have entered, but unless it's related to evidence, I don't think this directly affects the owner's defense.

Option E: The materials are part of a larger collection. That might make it harder to argue that it's explicit because maybe it's part of a larger set that includes more explicit content. But the owner's defense is about the specific materials, not the whole collection.

Option F: The materials depict normal sexual conduct. That's about the nature of the material. If the materials are normal, then the owner can argue it's not explicit enough. But the owner is trying to argue that it's explicit and protected, so this might not help unless the content is clearly non-explosive.

Option G: The materials were produced in the state. I don't see how that would help. The content's origin doesn't affect the First Amendment protections.

Option H: 85% of citizens believe explicit content doesn't contribute to antisocial behavior. That's a fact, but the owner's case is about the law, not the public opinion. So this doesn't directly help the owner.

So the key point is whether the materials were sold to explicit individuals. The owner is using B. If the owner can prove that all the materials were for consenting adults, then the owner can argue that it's protected speech because the sale is to an explicit group.

Wait, actually, the owner's defense is that the sale was of "obstetrically explicit material," but the First Amendment protects speech that is "obscenity," which is a bit different. But the main point is that the materials were sold to adults, so the owner can argue that the sale is protected speech because the material is explicit.

So the best answer would be option B. Because if the materials were only sold to consenting adults, then the owner can argue that the conduct is explicit and that the sale falls under the law's protection.

The owner's defense relies on proving that the materials sold were explicit and that the sale fell under the law's obscenity provisions. The most relevant argument is that the materials were sold to consenting adults only. This supports the owner's claim that the sale is explicit and protected speech.
