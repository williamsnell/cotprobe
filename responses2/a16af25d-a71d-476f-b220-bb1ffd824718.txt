Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the shortest path in an undirected graph. Hmm, let me read it again. The graph G has nodes labeled 0 through 5, and the edges are given as E = {<0,1>,<0,2>,<0,3>,<3,5>,<2,3>,<2,4>,<4,5>}.

The question is asking which path from node 0 to node 5 is the shortest. The options are A to J, each being a list of nodes.

Alright, so first, I remember that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is the path with the least number of edges. So, I need to find the path with the fewest steps from 0 to 5.

Let me visualize the graph. Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, and 3. Node 1 is only connected to 0. Node 2 is connected to 0, 3, and 4. Node 3 is connected to 0, 2, and 5. Node 4 is connected to 2 and 5. Node 5 is connected to 3 and 4.

So the structure looks like this:

0 is the center connected to 1, 2, 3.
3 is connected to 5.
2 is connected to 4 and 3.
4 is connected to 5.

Wait, so node 3 is connected to 5. So 0 can go directly to 3, then to 5. That would be the path 0 →3 →5, which is two steps. But wait, is that the shortest?

Wait, let me check all possible paths. Because maybe there's a shorter path through another node.

Wait, node 0 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3. So 0 →2 →3 →5. That's three steps. So that's longer than the direct 0→3→5.

What about other paths? Let's see. Node 0 can go to 2, which goes to 4, which goes to 5. So 0→2→4→5 is also three steps.

Alternatively, node 0 can go to 1, but that's just one step, but then where to go? From 1, you can't go anywhere else except back to 0, which would not help in moving towards 5.

So the direct path seems the shortest. But wait, what about node 2? Let's see. 0→2→3→5 is three steps, as I thought. Alternatively, 0→2→4→5 also three steps.

So either path is three steps. So the shortest path could be either option B or D, right? Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: [0,2,3,5] → three nodes, four steps? Wait, no, the list is node numbers, so the path is 0 →2 →3 →5. So that's three edges, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, how many edges are in that path? From 0 to 2 is one edge, 2 to 3 is another, 3 to 5 is another. So three edges, which is four nodes, but the path is represented by the nodes in order. So the list is [0,2,3,5], which is four elements. Wait, but how is the number of steps calculated? Oh, wait, the number of edges is one less than the number of nodes. So 0→2 is one edge, 2→3 is another, 3→5 is another. So three edges, four nodes. So the path is four nodes long.

But wait, options B and D are both four nodes long. So let's check the options:

Option B: [0,2,3,5] → 0 to 2 (edge 0-2), 2 to 3 (edge 2-3), 3 to 5 (edge 3-5). So correct.

Option D: [0,1,2,4,5] → 0→1 (edge 0-1), 1→2 (edge 1-2), 2→4 (edge 2-4), 4→5 (edge 4-5). That's four edges: from 0 to 5 via 1, 2, 4. So that's longer than the direct path.

So the shortest is either B or D, but wait, wait. Wait, is there a shorter path? Let's see. Are there any other paths with fewer steps?

What about 0→2→3→5: three edges. Or 0→3→5: two edges. So 0→3→5 is definitely the shortest.

But wait, let me check if 0 can reach 3 directly. Yes, 0 is connected to 3. So the shortest path is 0→3→5. That's two steps, so the path is [0,3,5], but that's not in the options. Wait, the options don't have that.

Looking back at the options, option H is [0,3,5], but wait, wait, no. Let me check.

Wait, the options are:

A: [0,2,3,4,5]
B: [0,2,3,5]
C: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
D: [0,1,2,4,5]
E: [0,2,4,5]
F: [0,1,3,5]
G: [0,1,4,5]
H: [0,3,5]
I: [0,3,2,4,5]
J: [0,1,2,3,5]

Wait, so option H is [0,3,5], which is three nodes. That would be two edges, which is correct. So that's the shortest.

Wait, but wait, is there an edge from 3 to 5? Let me check the given edges. Yes, E includes <3,5>, so that's present.

So the shortest path is 0 →3 →5, which is two edges, so the list is [0,3,5], which is option H.

Wait, but wait, in the options, H is [0,3,5], which is three nodes. So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option H.

But wait, looking back: the options, H is [0,3,5], which is three nodes, representing 0,3,5. So edges are from 0 to 3 and 3 to 5. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the notation can be confusing. For example, in the list [0,3,5], that would imply the path is 0 to 3 (edge 0-3), then 3 to 5 (edge 3-5). So that's two edges, which is correct.

So the correct answer is H.

The graph is undirected, and the shortest path from 0 to 5 is 0 →3 →5, represented as [0,3,5].
