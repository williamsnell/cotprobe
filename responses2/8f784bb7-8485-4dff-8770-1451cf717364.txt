Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about Austin's views on law. The question is asking which option correctly describes the attributes of law according to Austin. I remember that Austin's concept of law is somewhat different from other philosophers like Locke or Hume. 

So from what I recall, Austin categorizes law into three main attributes. Let me think about each of them. First, the command attribute. I think Austin thought that law is a command because it's a set of rules that can be executed. So, that would mean law has command. 

Next, the sovereign attribute. I believe that means law is a tool of government. Austin saw law as governing power, which has authority over society. So, that should be sovereign.

Then, the legal remedy attribute. I'm a bit fuzzy on this one. I think it refers to the ability to correct mistakes. So, perhaps law has the power to make mistakes and correct them. So, that would be legal remedy.

Looking at the options, option A says Command, sovereign and legal remedy. That fits what I was thinking. Let me make sure the other options are incorrect. Option B has command, sovereign, and authority. Wait, isn't authority a different term? Or is it related? I'm not sure if authority and legal remedy are the same thing. Maybe I should double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact terms. I think the attributes are command, sovereignty, and legal remedies, which is option A. So option B is incorrect because it adds authority, which might be a separate concept. Yeah, I'm pretty confident about option A being the correct answer.

The correct answer is **A: Command, sovereign and legal remedy**. This accurately reflects Austin's view that law has these three attributes. 

Answer: A
