Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about the growth rate of an economy based on certain parameters.

The problem states: In an economy, on average, the population saves 15% of its income. The marginal capital/output ratio is 2.5, meaning that an increase in the capital stock of $250 billion leads to an increase in output of $100 billion. We need to find the growth rate of this economy.

Hmm, I remember something about the Solow Growth Model. It involves the production function, capital accumulation, and how the economy grows over time. The key equation here is probably the one that relates these factors.

The Marginal Product of Capital (MPK) is the derivative of the production function with respect to capital. But in the context of the Solow model, the growth rate of output (Y) is given by the saving rate (s) multiplied by the MPK. So the equation would be something like:

g = s * MPK

Wait, is that right? Let me think. The Solow model says that in the steady state, the growth rate of output is equal to the saving rate multiplied by the marginal product of capital. So yes, that makes sense.

So in this problem, the saving rate (s) is 15%. The MPK is 2.5. So plugging into the equation:

g = 0.15 * 2.5

Let me calculate that. 0.15 times 2.5 is 0.375, which is 37.5%. Wait, that's way too high. But none of the options are that high. The options are 3%, 5%, 7.5%, etc., not 37.5%.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Could it be that the growth rate is the saving rate multiplied by the capital accumulation rate? Or perhaps I'm mixing the formulas.

Wait, another thought. The formula for the growth rate in the Solow model is approximately the saving rate times the marginal product of capital. So that's correct.

Wait, so if the saving rate is 15% and MPK is 2.5, then g would be 37.5%, but that's not in the options. Hmm. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says that an increase in output by $100 billion is caused by an increase in capital of $250 billion. So the MPK is 100/250 = 0.4 per dollar. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because MPK is usually output per unit of capital. Oh wait, no, MPK is output per capital. So, if output increases by 100 billion when capital increases by 250, then MPK is 100/250 = 0.4. Wait, that's different from what I thought before.

Wait, that's confusing. Earlier I thought MPK was 2.5, but if output increases by 100 when capital increases by 250, then MPK is 100 / 250 = 0.4. So that changes the calculation.

So, if MPK is 0.4, then g = 0.15 * 0.4 = 0.06, which is 6%. So the growth rate is 6% annually. Looking at the options, option G is 6%.

But wait, why did I get that? Because I thought MPK was 2.5, but the way the problem is presented, the increase is 100 for 250, so 100/250 is 0.4.

Wait, perhaps I got confused earlier. So let's clarify.

The problem states: "an increase in output of $100 billion per year is produced by an increase in the capital stock of $250 billion." So, for each $250 billion increase in capital, output (Y) increases by $100 billion. So, MPK = Y / K = 100 /250 = 0.4.

Thus, plugging into the growth rate equation, g = s * MPK = 0.15 * 0.4 = 0.06 â†’ 6%.

So the answer should be G: 6% per year.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A:4%, B:12%, C:2%, D:15%, E:7.5%, F:10%, G:6%, H:5%, I:3%, J:8%.

So G is 6%, which matches our calculation.

The problem involves calculating the growth rate of an economy based on the saving rate and marginal capital/output ratio. The key equation used is:

\[ g = s \times MPK \]

Where:
- \( s \) is the saving rate (15% or 0.15),
- \( MPK \) is the marginal product of capital, calculated as output increase divided by capital increase (0.4).

Plugging in the values:

\[ g = 0.15 \times 0.4 = 0.06 \]

Thus, the growth rate is 6% per year. Among the options, this corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
