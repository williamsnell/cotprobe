Okay, so I've got this question about the emission spectra of doubly ionized lithium (Li++) and a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that emission spectra are related to the energy levels of an atom. Let me think about how that works.

Wait, the question says their emission spectra are identical. Oh no, same thing? Like, same colors or same wavelength? Or same spacing? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, wait, the question says their spectra are identical, but the options are about how their wavelengths compare. So, if the spectra are identical, the energy transitions that cause them would be the same.

But wait, Li++ has Z=3, right? Because Li has atomic number 3. So Li++ has lost 2 electrons, making it doubly ionized. Hydrogen is H, Z=1. So the hydrogen's emission spectrum is based on n transitions from higher energy levels. Li++'s spectrum is based on transitions from higher energy levels as well.

The question is, what hydrogen atom's spectrum would match Li++'s? Oh wait, no, the options are about what hydrogen's spectrum is, but the question says the Li++ has identical spectrum to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... So the Li++ spectrum is identical to a hydrogen atom's, which means the hydrogen must have a certain n value such that the energy levels match Li++'s.

Wait, but hydrogen's energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula, right? The Rydberg constant R is a fundamental constant. So the wavelengths emitted in hydrogen's spectrum depend on 1/(n²), where n is the principal quantum number.

So for Li++, the emission corresponds to the same energy transitions as hydrogen. But wait, the Rydberg constant R is different for different atoms because R = (Z^2 * hc) / (2 * 1^2 * m_e * e^2), but wait no, wait, I think the Rydberg constant R is given by R = (m_e * e^4) / (8 * n^2 * h^3 * c * π^2) or something like that. Oh right, the Rydberg formula is 1/λ = RZ^2 (1/n1² - 1/n2²). But the Rydberg constant itself R is different for different Z.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. The emission spectrum of Li++ depends on the energy levels of the ion. The energy levels are proportional to Z². So the wavelengths (lambda) in the spectrum are inversely proportional to the square of the principal quantum number. Because the energy levels are E_n = - (Z² * R_H * hc) / n², where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen. So E_n for Li++ would be - (Z² * R_H' * hc) / n², where R_H' is the Rydberg constant scaled by Z².

So the wavelengths emitted would be proportional to 1/n². So for the same energy difference (same wavelength), the 1/n² ratio should be the same.

Wait, but if Li++ has a Rydberg constant R' = Z^2 R_H, then the energy levels are E_n = - (Z^2 R_H h c) ) / n².

So when you're looking at the transitions, the wavelength (lambda) for a transition from n to m is given by 1/lambda = R' (1/m² - 1/n²), but wait, no, the Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/lambda = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²) where n2 > n1. So for Li++, the equivalent would be 1/lambda = R' (1/n1² - 1/n2²), since R' is larger (because R' = Z^2 R_H).

Wait, but what's the point here? The question is, when would Li++'s spectrum be identical to a hydrogen's spectrum? Because the options are about a hydrogen atom. So let's say that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of H in a different state, and we're to find what state.

Wait, no, the question says: "the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ (Z=3, A=7) is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are...". Wait, wait, no, the wording is a bit unclear. Wait, no, let me read again.

The question says: "the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are ...".

That's confusing. Because the spectra being identical would imply that the wavelengths emitted are the same, but the energy levels would differ. But the question is about the hydrogen atom's wavelengths. So perhaps they're comparing the same series, but in a different atom.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again in terms of the energy levels.

For hydrogen, the energy levels are E_n = - (13.6 eV) / n².

For Li++, the energy levels are E_n' = -( (Z^2) * R_H * hc ) / n².

Wait, so the Rydberg constant for Li++ is R' = R_H * Z². So the energy levels are four times as deep for each n².

So if the hydrogen's E_n is E = -13.6 /n² eV, then Li++’s E_n would be - (R' * hc) /n² = -(R_H * Z^2 * hc)/n².

Wait, but the Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/lambda = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For Li++, it's 1/lambda' = R' (1/n1² - 1/n2²).

But since R' is larger, for the same 1/lambda, the (1/n1² -1/n2²) term must be smaller, meaning the same transition energies.

Wait, but the question is about the wavelengths. So if the Li++ spectrum is identical to a hydrogen atom's, but not same structure, it's because the hydrogen must have a higher n to produce the same 1/lambda. Alternatively, perhaps the same series of transitions but different n.

Alternatively, another approach: the energy levels of Li++ are E_n = - (Z^2 * R_H * hc) / n².

Hydrogen's E_n is E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

So, for the same transition (say, from n=2 to n=1 in Li++ and from n=4 to n=3 in hydrogen), the energy difference would be:

ΔE_Li++ = (Z² R_H hc / 2²) - (Z² R_H hc /1^2) ) → Z² R_H hc (1/4 - 1) = Z² R_H hc (-3/4).

Wait, but this seems negative, but energy is negative, so perhaps the magnitude is the same. But it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find the wavelength scaling factor between Li++ and hydrogen.

Wait, the question asks, which hydrogen atom's spectrum would have the same wavelengths as Li++'s. So the energy levels must be the same as Li++, meaning the same Z and (Z^2) factor.

Wait, but that can't be. Because Li++ has higher Z than H. So how would that affect the energy levels?

Wait, no, actually, the Rydberg constant R for Li++ would be much higher (since R ∝ Z²). So, the energy levels for Li++ would be way deeper (more negative) in energy than the hydrogen's.

Wait, but the problem says that the spectra are identical. So the energies must match. How?

Perhaps the transitions in Li++ are such that their wavelength is the same as for a hydrogen atom in a certain n.

Wait, energy levels for Li++: E_n = - (Z^2 * R_H * hc) / n².

Hydrogen's E_n = -13.6 eV /n².

So for two transitions in Li++, say, 2 → 1, the energy difference is:

ΔE = [ (Z² R_H hc ) (1/4 - 1) ] = Z² R_H hc (-3/4).

And for hydrogen, 4 → 3: ΔE_h = (13.6 eV) (1/9 - 1/16) ) = 13.6 eV ( (16 -9 )/(144) ) = 13.6 * (7/144) eV ≈ 0.645 eV.

Wait, the energies for the transitions would be different. So perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternative approach: The Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For Li++, it's 1/λ' = R' (1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R' = Z² R_H. So, 1/λ' = Z² R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²) ) = Z² [ R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²) ].

Comparing to hydrogen's 1/λ = R_H (same 1/n1² - 1/n2²) ), so the 1/λ' = Z² (1/λ) → λ' = λ / Z².

So if Li++'s wavelength is λ, then the corresponding hydrogen atom's wavelength is λ / Z². Z is 3 for Li++, so λ' = λ / 9.

Wait, but the question says the spectra are identical. So the emitted wavelengths would be same. That would require that the same 1/λ is emitted, but that only happens if the 1/λ’ equals 1/λ, which would mean Z²=1, which isn't the case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-express the Rydberg formula.

Hydrogen's case:

1/λ = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²)

For Li++, 1/λ' = (Z² R_H) (1/n1² - 1/n2²) ) = Z² (R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²) )

= Z² (1/λ)

So 1/λ' = Z² (1/λ) → λ' = λ / Z².

So, if the Li++ has a wavelength λ, the hydrogen would have λ' = λ/(3²)= λ/9.

That would mean that the wavelengths are smaller (longer) for Li++. But the question says the spectra are identical, which would imply the same wavelengths.

Wait, but that can't happen unless Z=1, which it isn't.

Hmm, maybe the question is about the same series of transitions. Like, both have transitions from n=2 to 1, but Li++ would have a longer wavelength because Z=3.

But wait, the question states that the spectra are identical. So the same wavelengths would have to match, which isn't possible unless the energy levels are the same. Which they aren't. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as: the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... So, perhaps the same set of wavelengths as hydrogen's. But Li++ has a higher Z, so its energy levels are deeper. So the same transition in hydrogen (like n=2→1) would have a higher energy, thus shorter wavelength.

So, perhaps, for the same series (like n=2→1), the Li++ would emit at a longer wavelength than H. To have the same spectrum, perhaps the Li++'s wavelength is scaled.

Wait, but the question says the spectra are identical. So the same wavelengths as hydrogen's. But Li++'s spectrum would have different wavelengths.

This doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the question is asking which hydrogen atom's spectrum would have the same wavelengths as the Li++ spectrum. But that can't be because Li++'s wavelength is longer.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the same series. For example, both produce the same series of transitions. Let's see.

Wait, another approach. The wavelength of the emitted photon is given by λ = hc/(E). The energy transitions in hydrogen are ΔE = 13.6 eV (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For Li++, the energy is Z² * 13.6 eV (1/n1² - 1/n2²) ). To get the same ΔE, you need to have the same 1/n1² - 1/n2², but wait, that's not possible because Li++ has higher Z². So the only way to have the same ΔE is to have a hydrogen atom with a different n.

Wait, but the question is about the same wavelengths as Li++'s spectrum, which would require that the same energy transition (same 1/λ) occurs. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which hydrogen atom would have the same energy transitions as Li++. But that's not possible because the Rydberg constant is different.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about what the question is really asking. It says, "the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ (Z=3, A=7) is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are...".

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the same spectrum but the same set of wavelengths. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because Li++ has a higher Z², so the energy levels are deeper.

Wait, maybe the question is saying that their emission spectra are identical in shape but not same wavelengths. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same series of spectral lines, but in a hydrogen atom. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the same wavelengths. So the Li++ spectrum has a certain wavelength, and which hydrogen atom would have the same wavelength. But that's not possible because Li++ has higher Z, so the same transition would produce a longer wavelength.

Wait, alternative approach: Let me think about the same series of transitions, like 2 → 1. For Li++, the energy difference is (Z² R_H) (1/4 - 1) ) = 3² * R_H ( -3/4 ) = (9 * R_H) * (-3/4) ) = -27/4 R_H. For hydrogen, 2 →1: energy difference is 13.6 eV (1 - 1/4 ) = 13.6 * 0.75 = 9.6 eV.

Now, the wavelength for Li++ would be λ = hc / |ΔE|.

So λ_Li++ = hc / (27/4 R_H) = (4 hc R_H )/(27 R_H) ) → wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think in terms of Rydberg's formula.

Hydrogen's transition 2→1 has 1/λ = R_H (1/1² - 1/2²) ) = R_H (3/4) → λ = 4/(3 R_H).

Li++'s transition 2→1: energy difference is (Z² R_H ) (1/4 -1) ) = Z² R_H (-3/4) → 9 R_H * (-3/4) = -27/4 R_H.

So 1/λ' = R' (1/4 -1) ) → 1/λ' = 9 R_H ( -3/4 ) → 1/λ' = -27/4 R_H.

But 1/λ is the same as the inverse of wavelength. So for hydrogen, 1/λ_h = R_H (3/4), so λ_h = 4/(3 R_H).

For Li++, 1/λ_Li = 9 R_H ( -3/4 ), which would be negative. That doesn't make sense because wavelength is positive. But the square of the energy is the same. So the absolute value is the same.

Wait, perhaps the absolute value of the energy difference is the same. So the energy for Li++ transition is 27/4 R_H, same as hydrogen's 3 R_H. So their absolute energy differences would be the same.

But this would mean that the same energy transition in Li++ would have the same wavelength as a transition in hydrogen? No, because their Z is different.

Wait, no. Because the transition in hydrogen is from n=2, which is lower energy than Li++'s transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking, which hydrogen's spectral lines would correspond to the same wavelengths as Li++'s. But that can't happen because Li++ has a higher Z. So the same transition in Li++ would have a longer wavelength than the same transition in hydrogen.

Wait, but the question says the spectra are identical. So perhaps the only way for the same wavelengths is if the same E_n in Li++ matches the same E_n in hydrogen. But since E_n is proportional to Z², that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the options given. The options are about the scaling of the wavelength.

The options are about factors. The question is, the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... So, perhaps the hydrogen atom must have a higher n to produce the same 1/λ.

For example, if the hydrogen has a higher n, the wavelength would be shorter, which would mean that the emitted photon is of lower energy. But that would change the wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same series of transitions but in a higher Z hydrogen. Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought. The Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For Li++, it's 1/λ' = (Z² R) (1/n1² - 1/n2²).

So for the same (1/n1² - 1/n2²) factor, 1/λ' = Z² * (1/λ), which makes λ' = λ / Z².

So, if in the hydrogen case, we have another transition (say, from n=3 to n=2), the wavelength would be λ_h = hc/(13.6 eV (1/4 -1/9)) ) → 13.6*( (9-4)/(36) ) ) → 13.6*(5/36) → 13.6 * 0.1388 ≈ 1.87 eV.

But wait, the actual example I'm thinking of is the transition from n=2 in hydrogen to n=1, which gives λ = 4/(3 R_H) → R_H is 13.6 eV/(1), so 1/λ = 13.6 * (3/4) → 10.2 eV. Wait, no, wait, R_H is 13.6 eV. So 1/λ = R_H (1/1² -1/2²) ) → 13.6 (1 - 0.25) ) → 13.6 * 0.75 = 9.99 eV, so λ ≈ 102 nm.

But the Li++ transition from n=2 to 1 would have a wavelength of 4/(3 R_Li) ) → R_Li is 3² * R_H = 9 R_H. So 1/λ' = 9 R_H (1/4 -1) = 9 R_H (-3/4) ) → 1/λ' = -27/4 R_H. The absolute value is 27/4 R_H, which is 27/4 * R_H.

But the hydrogen's 1/λ is 13.6 * (3/4) → 10.2 eV. So Li++'s wavelength would be longer than hydrogen's.

Now, the question is: the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... So in other words, the Li++ spectrum has the same wavelengths as a hydrogen's. But that's impossible because Li++'s wavelength is longer.

Wait, but the question says they are identical. So perhaps the correct answer is the hydrogen with a higher n. For example, if the hydrogen has n=4, then the transition would be from 4 to 3, and the wavelength would be λ_h = 4/(3 R_H) * something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the same transition in either atom would have the same wavelength. But since Li++ has a higher Z, the same transition would produce a longer wavelength than the same transition in hydrogen.

So if the Li++ has a transition from n=2 to n=1, the wavelength is longer than the same transition in hydrogen. So to have the same wavelength as Li++, the hydrogen would need a different transition, perhaps from a higher n.

Wait, but the question is not about the same transition but about the same spectrum, which would require the same energy levels. But energy levels are different. So perhaps the answer is none of the options. But that's not one of the choices.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the scaling of the energy levels.

The energy levels of hydrogen are proportional to 1/n².

The energy levels of Li++ are proportional to Z²/(n²).

So, for the same n, the energy is higher by a factor of Z².

So, if I want the same energy levels, but Li++ has higher Z², it's impossible. Therefore, the spectra can't be identical.

But the question says they are identical. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same series in the spectrum. So, for example, in hydrogen, the 2→1 transition is a series. In Li++, the 2→1 transition is another series. But the wavelengths would be different.

Wait, but the question is about the same series. So maybe the same n for both transitions. But Li++'s wavelength is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same ionization potential or something else. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to find the factor between the two. Since the energy levels are Z² times higher, the same transition in hydrogen would require a higher Z² to have the same energy, but this is not possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let's try to look for any similar problems.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the hydrogen atom with a higher n. For example, which hydrogen atom would require the same energy as Li++'s 2→1 transition. So, the energy for hydrogen's 2→1 transition is 9.99 eV (like before). The same energy in Li++ would require a transition from n where (3² R_H)(1/4 -1/n² ) = 9.99 eV.

Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, the correct approach is to see that the wavelength scales inversely with Z². So, if the hydrogen's wavelength is λ, then Li++'s wavelength would be λ / Z².

But the question is about when Li++'s spectrum is identical to hydrogen's. Unless Z=1, which it's not, this can't happen.

Wait another approach: the question is about identical emission spectra, meaning same energy transitions.

So if the hydrogen has a transition from n=2 → n=1, the energy difference is 13.6 eV (1 - 1/4) = 9.6 eV.

In Li++, the transition from n=2 → n=1 would have a higher energy, but that's not the same wavelength.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is the hydrogen atom with n=4. Because then, the transition from n=4 to n=3 would have an energy of 13.6 (1 - 1/9) ≈ 13.6 * (8/9) ≈ 12.35 eV.

Wait, but Li++'s transition from n=2 to n=1 has 9.6 eV, which is shorter wavelength.

So another approach: the same energy transition in hydrogen would imply higher Z, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the same wavelength, but the options don't include that. The options are about the scaling of the wavelength. So, perhaps the answer is the factor between them.

Wait, I'm out of ideas. Let me try to think again. The question is about the emission spectrum of Li++ and comparing it to that of a hydrogen atom. They are identical in structure but scaled in wavelength.

So, the wavelengths of the emitted photons from Li++ are longer than those from hydrogen. So, the scaling factor would be the square of the Z ratio.

Wait, Z is 3, so the scaling factor would be 3² =9.

But the question is about the scaling of the wavelengths. So, the wavelength for Li++'s transition would be longer than hydrogen's.

Wait, but the question says their spectra are identical. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the hydrogen's wavelength is shorter by a factor of Z², i.e., 9.

Wait, no, because for the same transition in Li++, the wavelength would be longer by a factor of Z². So, if the wavelength of Li++'s transition is λ_Li, then the hydrogen's transition would have λ_H = λ_Li * Z². But in reality, Li++ has a longer λ, so hydrogen would have a shorter λ.

Wait, but the question is about the same wavelengths as Li++'s. So, that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is that the hydrogen's wavelength is shorter by a factor of Z².

So, the correct scaling factor is 9, because Z=3.

Wait, but the options are about the factor by which the wavelength is scaled. So, the question is, the spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are... So, perhaps the hydrogen's wavelength is shorter by a factor of Z², which is 9.

So, the correct option would be the one that says the wavelength is scaled by a factor of 9.

Looking at the options:

A: wavelength is scaled by 1/9

B: 1/3

C: 1/5

D: 1/7

E: 1/1

Wait, the options don't include 9. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is, "the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ (Z=3, A=7) is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are...".

So, the Li++ has a certain wavelength. The hydrogen must have a wavelength such that their transitions are identical. So, perhaps another approach: the same energy transition.

Wait, but the energy levels are different. So, the same transition in Li++ would have a higher energy than the same transition in hydrogen, and thus a shorter wavelength.

Therefore, the hydrogen's wavelength would be shorter than Li++'s. So, the scaling factor is 9, because Z=3.

So, the correct option is the one where the wavelength is scaled by 1/9. Looking at the options, option A is 1/9.

But wait, the question is phrased as "identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are...". So, perhaps the hydrogen's wavelength is shorter by a factor of Z², i.e., 9. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but the question says "identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are...". So, perhaps the hydrogen's wavelength is longer, which would require a scaling factor of 1/9.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to summarize.

Problem: Li++ has emission spectrum identical to hydrogen's. Find the scaling factor.

Li++ has E = Z² R_H (1/4 - 1/n² )

Hydrogen has E = R_H (1/1² - 1/n² )

So, for the same 1/4 - 1/n² factor, the energies differ by a factor of Z².

So, the wavelength is inversely proportional to the energy, so the scaling factor would be Z².

So, the wavelength of Li++ is longer than hydrogen's by a factor of Z².

So, if the hydrogen's wavelength is λ_H, then Li++'s wavelength is λ_Li = λ_H * Z².

So, the scaling factor is Z². Since Z=3, the scaling factor is 9.

So, the wavelength of Li++ is longer than hydrogen's by a factor of 9.

So, the correct answer is the option that says the wavelength is scaled by 1/9. Which is option A.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are...". So, perhaps the hydrogen's wavelength is longer, which would require a scaling of 1/9.

So, the correct answer is option A.
</think>

The question asks about the scaling of the wavelengths between the doubly ionized lithium atom (Li++) and a hydrogen atom (H), given that their emission spectra are identical. To solve this, we analyze the relationship between the energy levels and wavelength scaling in the two systems.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels**:  
   - For hydrogen, the energy levels are proportional to \( \frac{1}{n^2} \).  
   - For Li++, the energy levels are proportional to \( Z^2 \cdot \frac{1}{n^2} \), where \( Z = 3 \).  

2. **Wavelength Scaling**:  
   - The wavelength (\( \lambda \)) is inversely proportional to the energy (\( E \)).  
   - For the same transition (e.g., \( 2 \to 1 \)), the energy levels differ by a factor of \( Z^2 \).  
   - Therefore, the wavelength scales by the inverse of \( Z^2 \).  

3. **Calculation**:  
   - Since \( Z = 3 \), the scaling factor for the wavelength is \( Z^2 = 9 \).  
   - This means the wavelength of Li++ is longer than that of hydrogen by a factor of \( 9 \).  

4. **Question Interpretation**:  
   - The question states that the spectra are identical, implying the same energy transitions.  
   - However, due to the difference in energy levels between Li++ and hydrogen, the scaling factor for the wavelength is \( 9 \).  

### Conclusion:
The wavelength of Li++ is longer than that of hydrogen by a factor of \( 9 \). Therefore, the correct answer is the option that reflects this scaling factor.

**ANSWER: A**
