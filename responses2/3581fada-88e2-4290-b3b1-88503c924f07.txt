Okay, so I've got this problem about a concave mirror. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on mirror problems, but let's see. The question says the image is at -16.2 meters, which I think means it's a virtual image because the sign is negative. The magnification is 1.79, and I need to find the object distance. 

Wait, I remember the mirror formula, which is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. Oh right, the magnification m is related to the image and object distances. Oh yeah, m = -di/do. Right, so the magnification is negative because virtual images are inverted.

So the given image distance di is -16.2 m. Let me write that down. So di = -16.2 m. And m is 1.79. Wait, wait, the magnification is 1.79, which is positive, but since di is negative, m should be negative. Oh wait, no: because m is -di/do. So m = - di / do. So rearranging, do = - di / m. But wait, di is -16.2, so:

do = (- (-16.2)) / 1.79 = 16.2 / 1.79. Let me calculate that. 16.2 divided by 1.79... Hmm, 1.79 times 9 is 16.11. So 16.2 is a bit more than 9 times. 1.79 * 9 = 16.11. So 16.2 - 16.11 = 0.09. So 0.09 / 1.79 is approximately 0.05. So 9 + 0.05 is about 9.05. So do is approximately 9.05 meters. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, I can do the division more accurately. Let me compute 16.2 divided by 1.79.

Hmm, 1.79 * 9 = 16.11 as I said. So 16.2 -16.11=0.09. 0.09/1.79 = 0.05 (approx 0.0502). So 9.0502 m, so approximately 9.05 m. So the object distance is 9.05 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 9.05. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. I should double-check using the mirror formula. So if do is 9.05, di is -16.2. Let's compute 1/do + 1/di: 1/9.05 is approximately 0.1105, and 1/(-16.2) is approximately -0.0617. Adding them: 0.1105 - 0.0617 = 0.0488. Then 1/f = 0.0488, so f is about 20.5 meters. That makes sense because the object is beyond the focal point. But wait, wait, wait. Let me compute 16.2 / 1.79 accurately. Hmm, 1.79 times 9 is 16.11. So 16.2 is 16.11 + 0.09. So 0.09 /1.79 is 0.05027. So 9 + 0.05027 =9.05027. So do is approximately 9.05 m.

Alternatively, let's calculate 16.2 /1.79:

1.79 * 9 = 16.11

16.2 -16.11 = 0.09

So 0.09 /1.79 = let's compute that. 1.79 goes into 0.09 about 0.05 times (because 1.79 * 0.05 = 0.0895). So 0.05, so 9.05.

So when plug do =9.05 into the mirror equation: 1/9.05 + 1/(-16.2) = approx 0.1105 -0.0617=0.0488. So f=1/0.0488â‰ˆ20.5 meters.

Hmm, but wait, another way to find m: m= - di/do. So m=1.79= -( (-16.2)/do ). So 1.79 = 16.2 / do. So do=16.2/1.79=9.05. So yes, the correct answer is B, 9.05.

To determine the object distance for the concave mirror, we use the given information: the image distance \( d_i = -16.2 \, \text{m} \) (indicating a virtual image) and the magnification \( m = 1.79 \). The magnification formula is:

\[
m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]

Rearranging for \( d_o \), we get:

\[
d_o = -\frac{d_i}{m}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
d_o = -\frac{-16.2}{1.79} = \frac{16.2}{1.79}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
d_o \approx 9.05 \, \text{m}
\]

To verify, we can use the mirror formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Substituting \( d_o = 9.05 \, \text{m} \) and \( d_i = -16.2 \, \text{m} \):

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{9.05} + \frac{1}{-16.2} \approx 0.1105 - 0.0617 = 0.0488
\]

Thus, \( f \approx \frac{1}{0.0488} \approx 20.5 \, \text{m} \), which is consistent with the assumption that the object distance is beyond the focal point.

The correct answer is:

**B: 9.05**
