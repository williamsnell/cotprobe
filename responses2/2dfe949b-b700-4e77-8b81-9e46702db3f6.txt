Okay, so Ms. Gutierrez has a gym class of 32 students, and each student needs a piece of rope that's 5 feet 8 inches long. I need to find the total length of rope she needs to order. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to convert the length of each rope into inches because dealing with feet and inches can be confusing. There are 12 inches in a foot, right? So, 5 feet would be 5 * 12 = 60 inches. Then, adding the 8 inches gives 68 inches per piece of rope. So each student gets a 68-inch piece.

Now, there are 32 students, so I multiply 68 inches by 32. Let me calculate that. 68 * 32... Let's see, 68*30 is 2040, and 68*2 is 136. Adding those together gives 2040 + 136 = 2176 inches total.

But wait, the answer needs to be in feet and inches, not inches only. So I should convert 2176 inches back into feet. To do that, I divide by 12. 2176 divided by 12. Let's see, 12 * 181 is 2172, because 12*180 is 2160, plus 12 is 2172. So 2176 minus 2172 is 4 inches. So that's 181 feet 4 inches.

Looking at the options, option B is 181 feet 4 inches. So the correct answer should be B.

The total length of rope needed is 32 students multiplied by 5 feet 8 inches each.

First, convert 5 feet 8 inches to inches: 5 * 12 + 8 = 68 inches per piece.  
Total inches: 68 * 32 = 2176 inches.  
Convert back to feet: 2176 / 12 = 181 feet with a remainder of 4 inches.

Answer: **B: 181 feet 4 inches**

Answer: B
