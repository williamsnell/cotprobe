Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the differences between animal and plant cells. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is asking what characteristic animal cells have that plants don't. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I'll think about each option. 

Option A says they have a cell wall made of cellulose. Wait, I remember that animal cells do have cell walls, right? They're called chitin in plants but have cell walls made of proteins like proteins. So animal cells have cell walls, so A is probably incorrect.

Option B is about lysosomes. I remember that both plant and animal cells have lysosomes. Lysosomes are organelles where enzymes are stored and broken down when the cell is damaged. So B can't be the correct answer.

Option C talks about large vacuoles storing water. Oh right, I think that's a feature of plant cells. They have a lot of these vacuoles called placentas which help them maintain their shape by absorbing water. Animal cells don't have that. So C is probably not the right option either.

Option D is about centrioles within centrosomes. Centrioles are involved in cell division, like how centrosomes generate them. Both plant and animal cells have centrosomes, so D doesn't make sense here.

Wait, so all the options except A are about things that aren't differences between animal and plant cells. So the only correct answer should be A. Because animal cells do have cell walls, whereas plants don't. So the answer is A.

The correct answer is A: animal cells have a cell wall made of cellulose. Both plant and animal cells have cell walls, but animal cells specifically contain cellulose, while plants have chitin. The other options (B, C, D) describe features that are shared by both plant and animal cells. 

Answer: A
