Okay, so I've got this question about federalism, and I need to figure out which option is the best answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about federalism.

Federalism is a political system where power is divided between a central authority and constituent units. So the idea is that the government isn't held entirely by one place but rather by a central government and other local governments.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the national government controls all subnational units. That doesn't sound right because federalism doesn't have a single central government; instead, there's a central authority and various regions governed by local governments.

Option B is about the division of power into national and subnational units. That seems to fit because in federalism, power isn't concentrated in one place but is spread out over different levels.

Option C claims power is primarily held by sub-nationals. Wait, that's the opposite of what I remember. I think federalism is more about the central government and the subdivisions, not the other way around.

Option D talks about division among political parties. That's more about party systems, like in some democracies, but not the core concept of federalism.

Option E is about national power splitting into branches. That's more about organizational structures, not the core definition.

Option F says all power is in one unit. That's more like a monoculture or a dictatorial system, not federalism.

Option G mentions the political leader being also religious. That's a specific feature of some religious systems, not the defining feature of federalism.

Option H is about sharing power between the national and international organs. While this happens in some systems, it's not the defining feature of federalism.

Option I is about concentration in a small group. Again, that's more characteristic of a system like a monarchy rather than federalism.

Option J says power transfers from national to sub-nationals. That's exactly the definition of federalism. The central government isn't the sole authority; it's shared with the local levels.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be J because it accurately describes the transfer of power between the national and subnational units.

The correct answer is J, "The transfer of power from national to subnational units." This accurately describes federalism, where the central government is not the sole authority and instead shares power with local governments.

Answer: J
