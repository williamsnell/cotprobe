Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the number of boys at West Elementary School. Let me read it again.

"At West Elementary School, there are 20 more girls than boys. If there are 180 girls, how can you find the number of boys?"

Hmm. So, the key points are: 20 more girls than boys, and there are 180 girls. We need to find the number of boys.

Wait, so if there are 20 more girls than boys, that means the number of girls is equal to the number of boys plus 20. Let me write that down: Girls = Boys + 20.

We know the number of girls is 180, so substituting that in: 180 = Boys + 20.

To find the number of boys, I need to solve for Boys. So, subtract 20 from both sides. That would be Boys = 180 - 20. 

Wait, but that seems straightforward. So, Boys = 160.

Looking at the options, I need to find the correct way to get 160. The options are various operations. Let me check each option:

A: divide 20 by 180 → 20/180 is 0.111… Not relevant here. Doesn't subtract 20.

B: add 180 to 20 → 200. That's not right.

C: multiply 180 by 20 → 3600. That's way too big.

D: multiply 180 by 2 → 360. Also too big.

E: divide 180 by 20 → 9. That's not right.

F: subtract 20 from 20 → 0. No, that's not it.

G: add 20 to 180 → 200. No.

H: subtract 20 from 180 → 160. Oh wait, that's exactly what we want. So option H gives 160, which is the number of boys.

Wait, but the question is asking how to find the number of boys. So the way to do that is to subtract 20 from 180. So H is correct.

Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. If there are 20 more girls than boys, then girls = boys + 20. So boys = girls - 20. Girls are 180, so subtract 20. 180 -20 = 160, which is correct. So the answer is H.

The number of boys can be found by subtracting 20 from the number of girls. So the correct answer is H.

Answer: H
