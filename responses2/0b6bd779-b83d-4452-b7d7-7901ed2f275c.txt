Okay, so I need to figure out what day of the week April will begin on, given that February 2011 had 28 days and March has 31. Hmm, I remember that the days of the week repeat every 7 days, so maybe I can use that to calculate the shift from February to March and then see how that affects April.

Wait, let's think step by step. February in 2011 had 28 days. Since 2011 started on a Sunday, I think? Or wait, no, I should probably confirm that. Wait, actually, I'm not sure about the starting day of 2011. Maybe I can calculate it based on known information or look for a reference.

Alternatively, I can use modular arithmetic. Since 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, that means February 2011 ended on the same day of the week as it started. So, if February 2011 had 28 days, it would end on the same day it started. Let's assume that February 2011 started on a Sunday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think 2011 started on a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Oh, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: January 1, 2011, was a Sunday. So January 1: Sunday. Then January 2 is Monday, and so on. So February 1, 2011, is two days after January 31. Since January has 31 days, let's see: 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 31 days after Sunday would be Sunday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so 3 days later than Sunday is Wednesday. So February 1, 2011, is a Wednesday. Therefore, February 2011 ends on a Wednesday, as it has 28 days (since 28 mod 7 is 0). So February 28 is a Wednesday, and March 1 is the next day, which would be Thursday.

Wait, but March 2011 has 31 days. So March 1 is Thursday, March 2 is Friday, and so on. Now, to find the day April 1 will be on. Since March has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days (31 mod 7 is 3). So March 1 is Thursday, adding 3 days would be Sunday (Thursday +3 is Sunday). So April 1, 2011, would be a Sunday. Wait, but the options are A: Wed, B: Sun, C:Thu, D:Fri, E:Sat, F:Mon, G:Tue.

Wait, so according to this, April 1 is a Sunday, which is option B. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because I thought March 1 was Thursday, and adding 3 days would make April 1 a Sunday. So the answer should be B: Sunday.
