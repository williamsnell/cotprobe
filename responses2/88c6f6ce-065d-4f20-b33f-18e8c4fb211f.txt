Question:

Which of the following statements concerning the regression population and sample is FALSE?

Options:

B: The population can be infinite
C: In theory, the sample could be larger than the population
D: A random sample is one where each individual item from the population is equally likely to be drawn.

Okay, so I've got this multiple choice question about statistics, specifically regression population and sample. The question is asking which statement is false. Let's break this down step by step.

The question gives four options: A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is false. Let's start by recalling what each term means.

Option A says the population is the total collection of all items of interest. That sounds correct. Population refers to the entire group we're studying, so that makes sense.

Option B claims the population can be infinite. Yeah, I remember that in some cases, especially with certain types of data, the population could be infinite, like the number of people in a city or something. So B is a true statement.

Option C states that in theory, the sample could be larger than the population. Hmm. Wait, that doesn't make sense. A sample is a subset of the population. So the sample can't be larger than the population, right? Because it's a part. Unless the population is being treated in a different way, but I don't think that's the case here. So C is probably false.

Option D says a random sample is one where each individual item is equally likely to be drawn. I'm pretty sure that's correct. Random sampling means each member has an equal chance, so D is true.

So, looking back at the options, the false statement would be option C. Because the sample can't be larger than the population in theory. It can be smaller or equal, but not larger. So the answer should be C.

The false statement is C: In theory, the sample could be larger than the population.

Answer: C
