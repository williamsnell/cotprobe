Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, the question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I need to determine if each is true or not, and then match them to the options given.

First, Statement 1 says that RoBERTa is trained on a corpus that's about 10 times larger than BERT's. Hmm, I remember that BERT is a well-known language model, and RoBERTa is an older model that's often cited for being more efficient. But wait, how much bigger is it? I think BERT is about 100 million tokens, and RoBERTa is about 400 million. So 400 million is indeed about 4 times bigger than 100 million. So statement 1 is probably true.

Now, Statement 2 is about ResNeXts in 2018 using tanh activation functions. I recall that ResNeXts are a type of residual neural network. The activation function used in ResNet, like the standard ones like ReLU or tanh, depends on the layer. Some layers use ReLU, others tanh. But the question says they usually used tanh in 2018. Wait, 2018 was before the introduction of ReLU, which was in a later paper. So in ResNeXts, maybe the activation functions varied, but I'm not sure if they used tanh exclusively. I think many ResNeXts used tanh, but I'm not certain about the typical usage in 2018. Alternatively, maybe the original ResNet papers used tanh. But I think the 2018 ResNeXts might have used tanh activation. So statement 2 is probably true.

So both statements are true. Looking at the options, option C is "True, True". That seems to match.

The answer is C: True, True.
