Okay, so I have this question about Stevenson's views on moral disagreements. I remember that Stevenson is a philosopher known for his theories on ethics. The question is asking what type of disagreement exists when two people discuss moral issues. The options are a bunch of different types of disagreements, like principles, understanding, experience, etc.

Stevenson's approach to ethics was based on human nature, right? He believed that moral reasoning is a part of human nature. So, he probably views moral disagreements as a reflection of differing principles or values. I think he talked a lot about the importance of understanding the nature of moral principles. So, when two people disagree on what's right or wrong, it's more about differences in how they understand the principles involved.

Looking at the options, option A is disagreement in principles. That makes sense because Stevenson emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying principles. So disagreements in principles would be a result of this. Option B is about understanding, which sounds like it's related to the deeper aspects of differing beliefs. But I think the key point is the disagreement in principles, not necessarily in understanding.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about what type of disagreement he specifically addresses. He said that moral disagreements are a natural result of differing principles. So the answer should be about principles. So option A.

Other options: B is about understanding in general, which might include understanding the principles but not specifically the nature of the disagreement. C is about experience, which doesn't fit. D is about practice, so that's more about actions, not principles. E is about interest, which is more about personal motivations. F is theory, so his theories might not directly address the disagreement type. G, H, I, J are about perception, attitude, belief, and values. Stevenson's theory was about the nature of moral principles, so values would be a part of that. But the main point is disagreement in principles, which is option A.

I think I'm confident with that. So the answer should be A.
