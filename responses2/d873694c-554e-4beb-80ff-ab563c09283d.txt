Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle RST. Let me try to visualize it first. So, triangle RST has points X on RS, Y on RT, and Z on ST. Then, XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST. The length of XY is 7, RT is 13, and the angle YXZ is 124 degrees. I need to find the length of XZ.

Hmm, midsegments... I remember that a midsegment of a triangle is a segment connecting the midpoints of two sides. And I think the midsegment is parallel to the third side and half as long. So, if XY is a midsegment, then it connects the midpoints of RS and RT. Wait, no, wait — XY is connecting X on RS and Y on RT. So that would mean X is the midpoint of RS, and Y is the midpoint of RT. So, XY is a midsegment connecting those midpoints.

If that's the case, then XY should be parallel to ST and half its length. Since XY is 7, ST must be 14. Wait, no, wait. If XY is a midsegment, then it's parallel to ST and its length is half of ST. So, if XY is 7, then ST is 14. That makes sense.

Wait, but the problem says the length of side RT is 13. Hmm, RT is a side of the triangle, not ST. So, let me make sure I'm not getting mixed up. Oh wait, XY is a midsegment, so it's parallel to ST, which is the side opposite to angle R. So, XY is connecting midpoints of RS and RT, so yes, XY is parallel to ST and XY is half of ST. That means if XY is 7, then ST must be 14.

But RT is given as 13. So, RT is 13. Now, in triangle RST, we have sides RT =13, ST=14, and RS we don't know yet. Wait, but we're trying to find XZ. X is on RS, Z is on ST, and XZ is another midsegment. Wait, or is XZ a midsegment?

Wait no, XY is a midsegment, and XZ is another midsegment. So, if XZ is a midsegment, then it must connect the midpoints of two sides. But which sides?

Wait, let me think again. The midsegments connect the midpoints of two sides, and they are parallel to the third side and half as long.

So, if XY is a midsegment, it connects the midpoints of RS and RT. So, X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT. Similarly, XZ is a midsegment, so it connects the midpoints of two sides. But which ones? If X is the midpoint of RS, then where else is the midpoint? Maybe it connects to the midpoint of ST.

Wait, let me clarify. So, in triangle RST, midsegments are:

1. XY connects midpoint of RS (X) and midpoint of RT (Y), so it's parallel to ST and half its length. So, XY is a midsegment, and its length is 7, so ST must be 14.

2. XZ connects midpoint of RS (X) and midpoint of ST (Z), so XZ is a midsegment, parallel to RT and half its length. Since RT is 13, XZ should be 13/2 = 6.5.

Wait, but the problem says that the length of RT is 13, and we have angle YXZ given as 124 degrees. So, angle YXZ is the angle between XY and XZ. So, if XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT, then angle YXZ is the same as angle at X between XY and XZ, which is the same as angle between ST and RT at point X.

Wait, but in triangle RST, at point X, which is on RS, the two sides connected are RX and SX. Wait, no, X is on RS, so the sides connected to X are RX and SX. Wait, but in the triangle, the sides are at R, S, T.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since XY is a midsegment parallel to ST, and XZ is a midsegment parallel to RT, then triangle XY Z is similar to triangle RST, scaled down by a factor of 1/2.

Wait, but wait. If XY is a midsegment, then X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST, because XZ is a midsegment. So, point Z is the midpoint of ST.

Wait, but the problem says that Z is on ST. So, XZ is a midsegment, connecting the midpoint of RS (X) to the midpoint of ST (Z). That makes sense. So, since XZ is a midsegment, it's parallel to RT, which is 13, so XZ would be 13 / 2 = 6.5.

Wait, but the problem didn't say that Z is the midpoint, but it was stated that Z is on ST. So, maybe Z is not necessarily the midpoint. Hmm, but if the midsegment connects midpoints, then yes, it's only possible if Z is the midpoint. Oh wait, but the problem just says Z is on ST, not necessarily the midpoint. Hmm. So, maybe that's not the case. So, perhaps XZ is not necessarily a midsegment, but the problem says it is. Wait, no, the problem says that XY and XZ are midsegments. So, both XY and XZ are midsegments, which means each connects midpoints.

Wait, no, if XY is a midsegment, then X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT. If XZ is a midsegment, then X is the midpoint of RS (same as before), and Z is the midpoint of ST. So, that would make XZ a midsegment, so it's the line connecting midpoints of RS and ST, making it parallel to RT and half as long. So, XZ is 13/2 = 6.5.

But wait, the problem says that the length of XY is 7, which we used to find that ST is 14 because XY is a midsegment. Then, since RT is 13, which is a side of the triangle, and XZ is parallel to RT, it should be 6.5. So, the length of XZ is 6.5, which is option B.

But wait, the problem didn't specify that Z is the midpoint. Oh wait, no, the problem says Z is on ST, but XY and XZ are midsegments. So, for XZ to be a midsegment, it must connect midpoints of two sides. Since X is the midpoint of RS, Z must be the midpoint of ST for XZ to be a midsegment. Otherwise, if Z is not the midpoint, XZ wouldn't be a midsegment. So, that makes sense.

So, yes, XZ is a midsegment, so its length is half of RT, which is 13, so 6.5. So, the answer should be 6.5, which is option B.

The problem involves triangle RST with midsegments XY and XZ. Since XY is a midsegment, it is parallel to ST and half its length. Given XY is 7, ST is 14. Since XZ is another midsegment, it is parallel to RT and half its length, making XZ 6.5. 

Answer: B
