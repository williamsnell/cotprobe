Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the results of fertilization. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my biology, but I'll try to think it through.

Fertilization is the process where a sperm cell combines with an egg cell to form a zygote. Right, and this process is crucial for the development of organisms. So, what happens next?

First, I remember that fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid cell. Wait, diploid because each parent cell provides one set of chromosomes. So the zygote has two sets. But wait, in the options, there's a choice that mentions formation of a diploid cell, which is option E. So that's probably one part.

After fertilization, the zygote needs to undergo various processes. I think it goes through mitosis, which is a type of cell division. So mitosis is a form of cell division, which would make option E's second part correct. So E has "Formation of a diploid cell, cell division..." which makes sense.

Next, I remember that fertilization also results in the production of proteins. That's part of protein synthesis, which is one of the options in option E. So that fits.

Then there's energy production. Fertilization, especially gametogenesis, involves the production of energy, which is part of cellular respiration. So that's another correct part in option E.

So the result of fertilization includes formation of a diploid cell, cell division, energy production, and protein synthesis. Looking at the options, option E lists all of these: A, B, C, D, E, F, etc.

Wait, let me check the other options quickly. Option A talks about DNA replication, cell division, energy, and proteins. Oh wait, DNA replication is part of cell division, but is it considered the result of fertilization? Hmm, I'm not sure. Fertilization leads to cell division, but DNA replication is a separate process involving the cell's own DNA. So maybe option A isn't the right answer.

Similarly, option E covers all the correct processes I thought of. So the correct answer is E.

The process of fertilization results in a diploid zygote, which undergoes mitosis (cell division), energy production, and protein synthesis. This aligns with the components listed in option E: "Formation of a diploid cell, cell division, energy production, and protein synthesis." 

Answer: E
