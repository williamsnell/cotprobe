Okay, so I've got this problem here about the density of liquid nitrogen and the fraction of empty space in the model. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the molecular diameter of an N₂ molecule is 3.15 × 10^-8 cm. Wait, diameter is 3.15e-8 cm, so the radius would be half of that, which is 1.575e-8 cm. Right, radius r = diameter / 2 = 1.575e-8 cm.

Then, the density of liquid nitrogen is 0.8081 g/cm³. We're supposed to find the fraction of the volume that's empty space using the hard-sphere model. Oh wait, I remember the hard-sphere model treats molecules as perfectly hard spheres, so the volume they occupy is just the volume of the spheres, and the rest is empty space.

So, the formula for the fraction of empty space (f) in a liquid would be f = (1 - (π d³)/(6 V_m³)) ), wait no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, in a liquid, each molecule is surrounded by others, so the volume occupied by the molecules is the number density times the volume per molecule. Wait, the number density (n) for a liquid is density (rho) divided by molar mass (M) divided by Avogadro's number (N_A). 

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to think in terms of the fraction of the container volume occupied by the molecules.

Wait, the volume of each molecule is (diameter)^3 / 8, because a sphere of diameter d has a volume of (4/3)π r³, and since r = d/2, substituting gives (4/3)π (d/2)^3 = (4/3)π (d³/8) )= π d³/(6). So each sphere's volume is π d³/(6). But wait, since each sphere is surrounded by others, the number of such spheres per unit volume is (n) = (density) / (molar mass * Avogadro's number). Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of the packing density.

But perhaps another approach: the packing fraction in a liquid is often considered in terms of the volume per molecule. So the fraction of the volume occupied by the molecules would be (number of molecules per volume) multiplied by (volume per molecule). So n = (rho * N_A )/(M m), where M is molar mass, m is molecular mass (same as molar mass for diatomic gases), and N_A is Avogadro's.

Wait, but for diatomic gas like N2, the molar mass M is 28 g/mol (since N is about 14 each, so 28). So let me compute n = (0.8081 g/cm³) * (6.022e23 mol⁻¹) / (28 g/mol). Let me compute that.

Calculating n: 0.8081 * 6.022e23 / 28. Let me compute numerator first: 0.8081 *6.022e23 = 0.8081 *6.022 ≈ 4.868e23. Divided by 28: 4.868e23 /28 ≈ 1.739e22 per cm³. So number density n ≈ 1.739e22 cm⁻³.

Each molecule has a volume of (diameter)^3/(8), since the sphere's volume is (4/3)π (d/2)^3. Wait, let me compute that: (d/2)^3 = d³/8. So volume per molecule is (4/3) * π * (d³/8) ) = (π d³ )/(6). So each molecule is a sphere of volume π d³/(6) cm³.

So the number of molecules per volume (n) multiplied by the volume per molecule gives the fraction of the volume occupied by the molecules: f = n * ( π d³ /6 ). Let me plug the numbers.

n = 1.739e22 cm⁻³.

d = 3.15e-8 cm, so d^3 = (3.15e-8)^3 = let's compute that.

3.15e-8^3 = (3.15)^3 * (1e-24) = approx 31.2 * 1e-24 = 3.12e-23 cm³. Wait, wait, 3.15^3: 3.15 *3.15=9.9225, times 3.15 again: about 31.257. So 31.257e-24 cm³.

So, (π d³)/6 = (3.1416 * 31.257e-24) /6. Let me compute that:

3.1416 *31.257e-24 = approx 98.25e-24. Divided by 6 is about 16.375e-24 cm³ per molecule.

Wait, no, wait, no, the calculation is n * ( π d³ /6 ). So f = n * (π d³/(6)).

So n = 1.739e22 cm⁻³.

Multiply by (π (d³) )/6.

Which is:

1.739e22 * ( (3.1416 * (3.15e-8)^3 )) /6.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Compute d^3: (3.15e-8)^3.

3.15^3 = approx 31.257. Cube of 1e-8 is 1e-24. So 31.257e-24 cm³.

Multiply by π: 31.257 *3.1416 ≈ 98.19e-24 cm³.

Now, multiply by n: 1.739e22 * 98.19e-24 = 1.739e22 * 9.819e-23.

Compute 1.739 *9.819 ≈ 17.07. Then exponents: 22 -23 = -1. So 17.07e-1 = 1.707.

So f = 1.707.

Wait, that can't be right—because f is the fraction of the container volume occupied by the molecules. So if f is 1.707, that would mean the fraction is about 1.7%? That can't be right because liquid nitrogen's packing density is about 67% (I think), but perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me reevaluate. The fraction of the volume occupied by the molecules is (number density) * (volume per molecule) = n * (4/3 π (d/2)^3 ). Because each molecule is a sphere of diameter d.

Wait, so the correct formula is f = n * (4/3 π (d/2)^3 ). Let me compute this again.

n is number density, which is 1.739e22 cm⁻³.

d is 3.15e-8 cm.

So d/2 = 1.575e-8 cm.

Volume per molecule: (4/3) π (d/2)^3 = (4/3) π (1.575e-8)^3.

Compute (1.575e-8)^3 = (1.575)^3 *1e-24. 1.575^3 is about 3.906. So 3.906e-24 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3) π: (4/3) *3.1416 *3.906e-24 = (4.1888) *3.906e-24 ≈ 16.37e-24 cm³ per molecule.

Wait, no: (4/3) * π * (d^3/8) ) gives the volume per molecule.

Wait, d is 3.15e-8 cm, so d^3 is (3.15e-8)^3 = appr 31.257e-24 cm³. Divided by 8: 3.907e-24 cm³. Multiply by (4/3) π: 4/3 *3.1416=4.1888. So 4.1888 *3.907e-24 ≈ 16.37e-24 cm³ per molecule.

So n * volume per molecule is 1.739e22 *16.37e-24.

Let me compute that: 1.739e22 * 16.37e-24 = 1.739 *16.37 *1e-2 = (approx 28.3) * 1e-2 → 0.283.

So f = 0.283, which is about 28.3%.

Wait, but the options show 28.70% as option H. Oh wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recompute n more accurately.

n = (rho * N_A ) / (M * m ), where M is molar mass.

Wait, M is 0.028 kg/mol (since N2 is 28 g/mol, which is 0.028 kg/mol). Wait, no, wait. Molar mass M = 28 g/mol = 0.028 kg/mol. No, wait, wait, no, no. 1 mole is 6.022e23 particles, so molar mass in kg/mol is 0.028 kg/mol (since 28 g per mole is 0.028 kg/mol).

But wait, the formula for number density is n = (rho * N_A ) / M.

So rho is 0.8081 g/cm³. N_A is 6.022e23 per mole. M is 28 g/mol.

So n = (0.8081 g/cm³) * (6.022e23 mol⁻¹) / (28 g/mol) )

Let me compute numerator: 0.8081 * 6.022e23 = 0.8081 *6.022e23 ≈ 4.868e23.

Divide by 28: 4.868e23 /28 ≈ 1.739e22 cm⁻³. So that part was correct.

Now, the volume per molecule is  (4/3) π (d/2)^3.

d=3.15e-8 cm. So (d/2) is 1.575e-8 cm.

So (1.575e-8)^3 = (1.575)^3 * (1e-8)^3 = 3.906 * 1e-24 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3) π: (4/3)*3.1416 ≈4.1888. So 4.1888 *3.906e-24 ≈ 16.37e-24 cm³ per molecule.

So f = n * volume per molecule: 1.739e22 *16.37e-24 = (1.739 *16.37) * 1e-2.

1.739 *16.37 = let's compute it. 1.7 *16=27.2, 0.039 *16=0.624. Then 1.7 *0.37=0.629, and 0.039 *0.37≈0.0144. So 27.2 +0.624=27.824; 0.629 +0.0144=0.6434. So total about 27.824 + 0.6434≈28.467.

So 28.467e-2 = 0.28467. So f ≈ 28.467% → about 28.5% or 28.3% based on the precise calculations.

Looking at the options, option H is 28.70%, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the volume per molecule calculation. Let me try again.

Volume per molecule is (4/3) π (d/2)^3.

d = 3.15e-8 cm, so (d/2) is 1.575e-8 cm.

So (1.575e-8)^3 = (1.575)^3 * (1e-8)^3. 1.575^3: 1.575 *1.575 is 2.480625. Multiply by 1.575: 2.480625 *1.575 ≈ 3.906 cm³.

So (d/2)^3 = 3.906e-24 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3) π: 3.906e-24 * (4/3 * 3.1416) → 4/3 *3.1416 ≈4.1888.

So 3.906e-24 *4.1888 = approx 16.37e-24 cm³ per molecule.

Then, n * volume per molecule = 1.739e22 *16.37e-24 = let me compute the exponents: 1e22 *1e-24 = 1e-2.

So 1.739 *16.37 = 28.467 → 0.28467. So approx 28.47% which is about 28.5%, but the options don't have that. The closest is option H) 28.70% and option G)80.00%. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the volume. Alternative approach: in liquid, the packing fraction (fraction of volume occupied by molecules) is given by η = (4/3) (π d³) / (6 V_m³) ) * n. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the packing fraction formula.

Wait, the fraction of volume occupied by the spheres in the liquid is f = (n * (4/3) π (d/2)^3 ) / (1) ), because each sphere is a single molecule, so the volume per molecule is (4/3) π (d/2)^3.

So f = n * (4/3 π (d/2)^3 )

Earlier calculation: f =1.739e22 * (4/3 π (3.15e-8/2)^3 )

Compute (3.15e-8 /2)^3 = (1.575e-8)^3 = (1.575)^3 * 1e-24 = 3.906e-24 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3 π): 3.906e-24 * (4.1888) ≈ 16.37e-24 cm³ per molecule.

n is 1.739e22 cm⁻³.

So f = 1.739e22 * 16.37e-24 = 1.739 *16.37 * 1e-2 → 0.28467, or 28.467%.

So approximately 28.5% is the fraction. Looking at the options, option H is 28.70%, which is closest. But wait, I'm getting 28.467, which is about 28.5% but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options: A-D are between 50-60. E is 42%. F is 50.00%. G is 80%. H is 28.70%. I is 55.25%. J is 60%.

So the closest option to 28.5% is H) 28.70%. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the volume per molecule is (4/3) π (d/2)^3, but perhaps I should have accounted for the fact that the spheres are hard and the packing isn't perfect. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the fraction is f = (1 - (π d³)/(6 V_m³ )) * n. Hmm, no, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the fraction of the volume not taken by the molecules. So the fraction is (1 - f), where f is the fraction of the volume taken by the molecules. So if I calculated f as 28.5%, then the empty space is 71.5%.

Looking at the options, option F is 71.30%. Hmm, that's close. So maybe the fraction of the volume taken is 28.7% (option H), so the empty space is 71.3%, which is option F.

Wait, but I thought earlier f is 28.5% which is option H. But in the initial calculation, the fraction of the molecule's volume is 28.5%, which would make the empty space 71.5%, which is option F.

Ah, that makes sense. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fraction of the volume taken as (n * (4/3 π (d/2)^3 )) ), and the empty space is 1 - that fraction.

So f = (n * (4/3 π (d/2)^3 )) )

Which is 1.739e22 * 16.37e-24 → 0.28467. So f =28.5%, so empty space is 71.5% → option F (71.30%) is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states: 'the fraction of the volume of the liquid that is occupied by the molecules of the liquid.' So if that fraction is 28.5%, then the fraction of the volume that is empty is 1 - 0.285 = 0.715, so 71.5%.

Looking at the options, F is 71.30%, which is closest. So the correct answer should be option F.
</think>

To determine the fraction of the volume occupied by liquid nitrogen (N₂) and the corresponding fraction of the volume that is empty, we proceed as follows:

### Key Parameters:
- **Density of liquid nitrogen**: \( \rho = 0.8081 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \)
- **Molar mass of N₂**: \( M = 28.00 \, \text{g/mol} \)
- **Diameter of a nitrogen molecule**: \( d = 3.15 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \)
- **Number density of liquid nitrogen**: \( n = \frac{\rho N_A}{M} \), where \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the number density \( n \)
\[
n = \frac{\rho N_A}{M} = \frac{0.8081 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}}{28.00}
\]
- Numerator: \( 0.8081 \times 6.022 \approx 4.868 \times 10^{23} \)
- Division: \( \frac{4.868 \times 10^{23}}{28.00} \approx 1.739 \times 10^{22} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \)

Thus, \( n \approx 1.739 \times 10^{22} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the volume occupied by one nitrogen molecule
The volume of a single nitrogen molecule is given by:
\[
V_{\text{molecule}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^3
\]
- \( \frac{d}{2} = \frac{3.15 \times 10^{-8}}{2} = 1.575 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \)
- \( \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^3 = (1.575 \times 10^{-8})^3 = 3.906 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^3 \)
- \( V_{\text{molecule}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 3.906 \times 10^{-24} \approx 16.37 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^3 \)

Thus, the volume occupied by one nitrogen molecule is \( V_{\text{molecule}} \approx 16.37 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^3 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the volume occupied by nitrogen molecules
The fraction of the volume occupied by nitrogen molecules is:
\[
f = n \times V_{\text{molecule}}
\]
Substitute \( n = 1.739 \times 10^{22} \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) and \( V_{\text{molecule}} = 16.37 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^3 \):
\[
f = (1.739 \times 10^{22}) \times (16.37 \times 10^{-24}) = (1.739 \times 16.37) \times 10^{-2}
\]
- \( 1.739 \times 16.37 \approx 28.467 \)
- \( f \approx 28.467 \times 10^{-2} = 0.28467 \)

Thus, the fraction of the volume occupied by nitrogen molecules is approximately \( f \approx 28.5\% \).

### Step 4: Calculate the fraction of the volume that is empty
The fraction of the volume that is empty is:
\[
\text{Empty fraction} = 1 - f
\]
Substitute \( f \approx 0.285 \):
\[
\text{Empty fraction} = 1 - 0.285 = 0.715 \, \text{or} \, 71.5\%
\]

### Step 5: Match the result with the options
The closest option to \( 71.5\% \) is **F) 71.30%**.

### Final Answer:
The fraction of the volume of the liquid nitrogen that is empty is approximately **71.30%**.

ANSWER: F
