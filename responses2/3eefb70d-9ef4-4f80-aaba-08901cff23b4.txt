Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of collisions. Let me read it again.

The question says: In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m that's at rest. They stick together after the collision. I need to find out what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost. The options are from A to J, with various fractions like 2/5, 1/5, etc. Hmm, I think this is about inelastic collisions because the particles stick together.

Alright, so first, I remember that in collisions, whether it's elastic or inelastic, momentum is always conserved, but kinetic energy isn't necessarily. Since they stick together, it's an inelastic collision, so kinetic energy is lost.

Let me think about the steps. I should probably use the principles of conservation of momentum and conservation of kinetic energy (but wait, no, because it's inelastic, only momentum is conserved. Wait, but in this case, since they stick, it's an inelastic collision, so kinetic energy isn't conserved. But the problem is about the fraction of KE lost, so I might need to calculate initial KE and final KE, then see the difference.

Wait, another way is to find the fraction. Let's outline the steps:

1. Find the initial kinetic energy.
2. Find the final kinetic energy after the collision.
3. Subtract the final from the initial to get the change.
4. Divide that change by the initial to get the fraction lost.

Let me get into the details.

Initial setup: Particle 1 has mass 2m and initial velocity v1. Particle 2 has mass m, and since it's at rest, initial velocity is 0.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the velocities. Oh wait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the initial velocities are such that the collision is perfectly inelastic, but I don't have any numbers. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the velocities. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the velocities are given implicitly? Or maybe in this problem, the initial velocities are such that the kinetic energy is calculated.

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up the types of collisions. Oh, wait, the problem doesn't give any velocities. So maybe it's a standard setup where, for example, the 2m particle is moving, and the m is at rest. But wait, since there are no given velocities, I must have missed some information. Wait, perhaps the initial velocities are the same? Or do I have to assume something else? Hmm, no, the problem doesn't state that. Wait, maybe the question is given without any velocities, so perhaps I'm supposed to compute it in terms of initial velocities, but that can't be right because the options give fractions based on the initial KE.

Wait, wait, perhaps the velocities are such that the initial KE is given in terms of m and the velocities, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are the same before collision. Hmm, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The important point is that particles stick together, so the final mass is 2m + m =3m. And the initial mass is 2m.

In one-dimensional collisions, when two objects stick together, it's a perfectly inelastic collision. So, the final velocity can be found using conservation of momentum.

But wait, in this case, the initial velocities are not given. So maybe the velocities are such that the initial kinetic energy is known in terms of m and the velocities. Or perhaps the velocities are the same, but that's not stated. Wait, the problem says it's a one-dimensional collision, but doesn't specify the initial velocities. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing part of the problem. Oh wait, the problem says the particles stick together after the collision, so it's an inelastic collision. But without the initial velocities, I can't compute the final velocity. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are the same as the initial velocities of the 2m particle, but that's not stated.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps the initial velocities are the same. Let me think. Let's assume that the 2m particle is moving with some velocity v, and the m is at rest. Then, after collision, they move together with a common velocity.

So, initial momentum is (2m)*v + m*0 = 2mv.

Final momentum is (3m)*v_final.

Conservation of momentum gives 2mv =3m v_final.

So v_final = (2mv)/(3m) )= (2/3)v.

Okay, so now, the initial kinetic energy is (1/2)(2m)v² = m v².

The final KE is (1/2)(3m)v_final² = (1/2)(3m)( (2v/3) )².

Let me compute that: (2v/3)^2 is 4v²/9. So (3m * 4v²/9) * 1/2.

3m * 4v²/9 = (12 m v²)/9 = (4 m v²)/3. Multiply by 1/2: (4/6) m v² = (2/3) m v².

So initial KE was m v², final is (2/3) m v².

So the change in KE is (m v²) – (2/3 m v²) = (1/3 m v²) loss.

The fraction lost is (1/3 m v²) / m v² = 1/3.

Wait, but the options don't have 1/3. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 2/5

B: 1/2

C: 4/5

D: 1/5

E: 3/4

F: 1/4

G: 1/3

H: 2/3

I: 0

J: 3/5

So, option G is 1/3, which would be the fraction lost. But wait, wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate.

Initial KE: (1/2)(2m)(v)^2 = m v².

Final KE: (1/2)(3m)( (2v/3) )².

Compute (2v/3)^2: 4v²/9.

Multiply by 3m: 3m *4v²/9 = (12 m v²)/9 = (4 m v²)/3.

Multiply by 1/2: (4 m v²)/3 * 1/2 = (2 m v²)/3.

So final KE is (2/3) m v².

Change in KE is m v² – (2/3 m v²) = (1/3) m v².

So fraction lost is (1/3) m v² / (m v²) )= 1/3 → 1/3.

But wait, none of the options have 1/3. Oh wait, looking again, option G is 1/3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me recheck.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the initial velocities are not the same. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's think again: initial momentum is (2m) * v + m * 0 = 2 m v.

After collision, momentum is (3m) v_final.

So, 2 m v =3 m v_final → v_final= (2m v) / 3m → v_final = (2/3) v.

Initial KE: (1/2)(2m) v² = m v².

Final: (1/2)(3m) ( (2/3 v) )² = (3m/2) * (4 v²/9) )= (3m *4 v²) / (2 *9) )= (12 m v²) / 18 → (2 m v²)/3.

So KE after is (2/3) m v².

So the change is ( m v² ) – (2/3 m v² ) = (1/3 m v² ).

Fraction lost: (1/3 m v²) / (m v² )= 1/3.

So the fraction is 1/3, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 1/3, so the answer should be G.

But wait, looking at the options again, the user wrote:

Options:

A: 2/5

B: 1/2

C: 4/5

D: 1/5

E: 3/4

F: 1/4

G: 1/3

H: 2/3

I: 0

J: 3/5

So option G is 1/3.

Wait, but wait! Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the velocities. Wait, the initial velocity of the 2m might be different from the m particle. Oh, but the problem doesn't state any velocities, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial velocities are such that the 2m has velocity v, and the m is at rest, but maybe the velocities are arranged differently. Oh, another approach: perhaps the initial velocities are the same, but the problem states that the collision is inelastic. No, wait, if the 2m and m have same velocities, then after inelastic collision, they stick and move at same speed, so that's a perfectly inelastic collision. But in reality, this is a perfectly inelastic collision, so that's correct.

Wait, but in this case, the initial KE is m v², and the final is (2/3) m v², so the KE lost is 1/3 m v², which is 1/3 of the initial KE. So the fraction is 1/3, which is option G.

Wait, but I thought the initial setup was as I did before, and that leads to 1/3.

But wait, looking at the options, option H is 2/3, which is the opposite of what I thought. Did I get the fraction correct?

Wait, wait, no. The fraction lost is (1/3), so 1/3 is the fraction of the initial KE that is lost.

But wait, another way to think: the initial KE is m v², and the final is 2/3 m v². The loss is (m v² - 2/3 m v²) = (1/3) m v².

So the fraction is (1/3)/(1) = 1/3.

So the answer should be 1/3, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 1/3, which matches.

But wait, wait another thing: the problem says "nonrelativistic" collision, but doesn't that affect anything here?

Wait, no, because in non-relativistic, we don't have to worry about higher terms in velocity. So the calculations should hold.

So, in conclusion, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost is 1/3, which is option G.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision as a perfectly inelastic one where two particles stick together after the collision. The initial mass of the first particle is \(2m\), and it is moving with velocity \(v\), while the second particle has mass \(m\) and is initially at rest. The goal is to determine the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost during the collision.

### Step 1: Conservation of Momentum
In an inelastic collision, momentum is conserved. The initial momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = (2m)v + m(0) = 2mv
\]
After the collision, the two particles stick together and move with a common velocity \(v_{\text{final}}\). The final momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{final}} = (2m + m)v_{\text{final}} = 3m v_{\text{final}}
\]
Using conservation of momentum:
\[
2mv = 3m v_{\text{final}} \implies v_{\text{final}} = \frac{2v}{3}
\]

### Step 2: Initial and Final Kinetic Energies
The initial kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2}(2m)v^2 = mv^2
\]
The final kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}(3m)v_{\text{final}}^2 = \frac{1}{2}(3m)\left(\frac{2v}{3}\right)^2
\]
Simplify \(v_{\text{final}}^2\):
\[
\left(\frac{2v}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4v^2}{9}
\]
Substitute into the expression for \(KE_{\text{final}}\):
\[
KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}(3m)\left(\frac{4v^2}{9}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{12mv^2}{9} = \frac{2mv^2}{3}
\]

### Step 3: Change in Kinetic Energy
The change in kinetic energy is:
\[
\Delta KE = KE_{\text{initial}} - KE_{\text{final}} = mv^2 - \frac{2mv^2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}mv^2
\]

### Step 4: Fraction of Kinetic Energy Lost
The fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost is:
\[
\text{Fraction lost} = \frac{\Delta KE}{KE_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}mv^2}{mv^2} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

### Final Answer
The fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is \( \frac{1}{3} \), which corresponds to option **G**.
