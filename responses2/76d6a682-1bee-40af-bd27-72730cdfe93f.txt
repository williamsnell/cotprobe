Question:

A farmer who raises hens for egg production wants his eggs to have a mean mass of 56 grams. He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?

Options:

A: Because tis more extreme than ±2.00, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
B: Because tis more extreme than ±1.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
C: Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
D: Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 20 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
E: Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 16 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
F: Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 16 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
G: Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 20 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
H: Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
I: Because tis less extreme than ±2.00, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.
J: Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question. Let's read it carefully.

So, the scenario is a farmer who is buying a new type of hen. He wants his eggs to have a mean mass of 56 grams. He took a random sample of 18 eggs. The distribution is symmetric and mound-shaped, which probably means it's approximately normal, right? He calculated a t-test and got a test statistic of t = -1.973. The significance level is 5%, which is 0.05.

The question is about the conclusion he should make based on the t-test result. The options are A to J, each providing a different reasoning.

First, I need to understand what a t-test with these parameters tells us. The t-test is probably a two-tailed test because the question is asking if the mean is different from 56 grams. So, we're testing H0: μ = 56 vs. H1: μ ≠ 56.

The t-statistic here is -1.973. I remember that for a two-tailed test at 5% significance, the critical t-values are ±2.01 (I think from tables, like for 17 degrees of freedom because the sample size is 18, so degrees of freedom is n-1=17). Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't specify the degrees of freedom. Oh, because the sample size is 18, degrees of freedom would be 17. But one of the options refers to 18 degrees of freedom. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option H says "Because tis more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom." And option A says 2.00. Wait, I think I might have confused the critical value from tables.

Wait, the critical t-value for 17 degrees of freedom and a two-tailed test at 5% is approximately 2.110. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a two-tailed test, each tail gets half the significance level. So 5% in total, so each tail gets 2.5%. So, for 17 df, the t-critical two-tailed is about 2.110. But some tables might round it to 2.11 or 2.12. Alternatively, maybe it's 2.01 for 18 df? Let me think.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The critical value depends on degrees of freedom (df) and the significance level. For a two-tailed test at 0.05, the critical value is the t-value where the probability in each tail is 0.025.

So for df=17, the critical t is about 2.110. But some tables might have 2.01 for 18 df? Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. No, the value should be higher for lower df. So for df=17, the two-tailed critical value is about 2.110, and for df=18, it's about 2.117? Or wait, no, perhaps it's 2.01? Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the critical t-value for two-tailed test with 5% significance and 17 degrees of freedom is approximately 2.110. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the critical value is 2.01 for 18 df, but that doesn't seem right because 18 df is higher than 17, so the critical value should be smaller.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For 17 df, the critical t for two-tailed 0.05 is 2.110. For 18 df, it's 2.01? No, that can't be. Because 18 is higher, the critical t should be lower. Wait, no. Wait, if df increases, the critical t decreases. Because with more degrees of freedom, the t-distribution is closer to normal, so the critical values are smaller. So for 17, it's about 2.11, for 18, it's about 2.01? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should just look up the critical t-values. But since I can't look it up right now, I'll have to proceed with what I know.

The test statistic is -1.973. So the absolute value is 1.973.

The critical value for two-tailed 5% is 2.110. Because the t-test is two-tailed, the critical region is beyond 2.110 in either direction.

So the test statistic is 1.973, which is less than 2.110. So it's not in the rejection region.

Wait, but the options are about how the test statistic compares to the critical value. So if the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, it's beyond the cutoff, leading to rejection. Otherwise, not.

In this case, the test statistic is 1.973, which is less than 2.110. So it's not in the rejection region. Wait, but some sources might consider the absolute value, but no, the test is two-tailed, so the critical value is 2.110, and if the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than that, we reject.

So the farmer's test statistic is 1.973, which is less than 2.110. So he should not reject the null hypothesis.

Wait, but the options B and H both state that. Looking at the options:

Option B: Because t is more extreme than ±1.96, he should reject. But wait, 1.96 is the critical value for 99% confidence, or for 2-tailed test with 5% significance level, the critical t is 2.01 (approx). So if the test statistic is 1.973, which is less than 2.01, then it's not in the critical region. So option B says 'more extreme than ±1.96' but that's not correct, because 1.973 is greater than 1.96. So maybe that's a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, the test statistic is 1.973. The critical t for 17 degrees of freedom is 2.110. So 1.973 < 2.110, so it's not in the rejection region.

So the test would not reject the null hypothesis. So looking at the options, I need to see which ones state that.

Option B: Because t is more extreme than ±1.96. Wait, 1.973 is greater than 1.96, meaning it's more extreme than 1.96. But that's not correct, because the critical value is 2.110, not 1.96. So B is incorrect because the critical value is higher than 1.96. So B is wrong.

Wait, but maybe I'm confusing the critical values. Let's think again: 2-tailed, 5% significance level.

The critical value for 17 df is approximately 2.110. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, perhaps I'm remembering it wrong. Because for a two-tailed test, the critical value is such that the area in each tail is 2.5%. So the t-value is higher than 1.96 because 1.96 is from the 95% confidence interval, which is for a one-tailed test. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no. For a one-tailed test at 5% (i.e., 95% confidence), the critical t is 1.645 for large samples, but here we have a t-distribution.

Wait, for a two-tailed test with 5% significance, each tail has 2.5%. The critical t depends on the degrees of freedom. For 17 df, the critical t is about 2.110. For 18 df, it's about 2.01. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, perhaps I have the numbers wrong. Let me think again. The critical t for a two-tailed test with 5% and 17 df is about 2.110. For 18 df, it's about 2.015. I think that's the case. So, for 18 df, the critical t is approximately 2.015.

Wait, but the test statistic is 1.973. Which is less than 2.015, so it's not in the rejection region. So the conclusion should be that he doesn't reject the null hypothesis.

Looking at the options, the correct reasoning would be that the test statistic is less extreme than the critical value. So looking back at the options:

Option E: Because t is more extreme than the critical value for 16 degrees of freedom. Wait, because 16 df would have a critical t value of about 2.131 (I think). Because for 16 df, the critical t for two-tailed 5% is approximately 2.131. So, 1.973 is less than that, so not in the region.

Option F: Because t is less extreme than the critical value for 16 degrees of freedom. So F says the test statistic is less extreme than 2.131, so he should not reject. That would be correct.

Wait, but let's look at each option.

Option B: Because t is more extreme than ±1.96. But 1.973 is greater than 1.96, which is the 95% one-tailed, but here it's two-tailed. So I think the critical value for two-tailed 5% is higher. So option B is incorrect because the test statistic is not more extreme than 1.96.

Option A: Because t is more extreme than ±2.00. The critical value is 2.110 for 17 df, so 1.973 is less than 2.110. So A is incorrect.

Option D: Because t is less extreme than critical for 20 df. Wait, 20 df's critical t is about 2.032 for two-tailed 5%. 1.973 is less than 2.032. So D says it's less extreme, so not in the critical region. So D is correct? Wait, no. Because the critical value for 20 df is about 2.032. The test statistic is 1.973, which is less than 2.032. So it's not in the critical region. So D is saying because it's less extreme, so don't reject. So D is a correct conclusion, but is the reasoning correct.

Wait, but the test statistic is more extreme than 2.00? No, because 1.973 is less than 2.00. So option D says because it's less extreme than the critical value for 20 degrees of freedom. So that would be correct because 1.973 is less than 2.032, so not in the rejection region.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

Option E: Because t is more extreme than critical value for 16 df. No, 1.973 < 2.131, so it's not more extreme. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Because t is less extreme than critical value for 16 df. So the test statistic is less than 2.131. So F's statement is correct. Therefore, the reasoning is that because the test statistic is less extreme than the critical value, so he doesn't reject the null.

But wait, the critical value for 18 df would be higher, perhaps. Let's think about the options again.

Looking at the options, the correct conclusion is that the test statistic is not in the rejection region. So the correct option should state that.

Looking at the options:

Option H: Because t is more extreme than critical value for 18 df. That can't be correct because 1.973 < 2.110.

Option F: Because t is less extreme than critical value for 16 df. So 1.973 < 2.131, so no. So F is correct.

Wait, but the options don't all say that. Let me check.

Wait, the options are:

A: 2.00

B: 1.96

C: 17

D: 20

E:16

F:16

G:20

H:18

I:2.00

J:2.00

Wait, so let me check each option.

Which option is correct? So the correct reasoning is that the test statistic (1.973) is less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom. So option H says more extreme, which is wrong. Option F says less extreme than 16 df, which is correct because 1.973 < 2.131.

So the correct conclusion is option F.

But wait, wait. Wait, the options' reasoning are about the critical value. Let me see the question again.

The question is: "If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?"

The options are from A to J. So for each option, explain why the conclusion is correct.

So, for example, option E says: Because t is more extreme than the critical value for 16 degrees of freedom, he should reject the null. That's wrong because 1.973 is less than 2.131 (critical for 16 df), so it's not in the rejection region.

So the correct option is the one where the test statistic is less extreme than the critical value. Looking at the options, F says because t is less extreme than critical value for 18 df.

Wait, but 18 df's critical t is higher than 16 df's. So, if the critical value for 18 df is higher than that of 16, then a test statistic less than 16's critical value would also be less than 18's. So, the reasoning in option F is correct because t is less than the 16 df critical value, which is higher than the 18 df critical value.

Wait, but the critical value for 18 df is higher. So 1.973 is less than the 16 df critical value. So the test statistic is less extreme than 16 df's critical value, which is higher than the 18 df's critical value. So the correct reasoning is that it's less extreme than the 18 df critical value. So option F's reasoning is correct.

Wait, no. To clarify: the critical value for 18 df is higher than that for 16 df. So 1.973 is less than the 18 df critical value (which is, say, 2.110). So, the test statistic is less extreme than 18 df's critical value, meaning it's not in the rejection region.

So the correct option is F: Because t is less extreme than critical value for 18 df, he does not reject the null.

Wait, but the initial reasoning in the question is that the test statistic is more extreme than the critical t for 16 degrees of freedom. So, perhaps I should re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the critical value for 16 df is 2.131, while for 18 it's 2.110. So the test statistic is 1.973, which is less than 2.131. So it's less extreme than 16 df's critical value but more extreme than 18 df's critical value.

So, the test statistic is more extreme than 18's. So, the conclusion is that the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value at 18 df, so it's not in the rejection region. So the correct reason is that it's more extreme than the critical value for 18 df, so he doesn't reject.

So option H says more extreme than critical for 18, but that's incorrect. Because 1.973 is more extreme than 18's critical value (2.110), which is not correct.

Wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

If the critical value for 18 df is higher than 16 df's, then a test statistic that's less than 16's critical value would be less than 18's. So, the test statistic (1.973) is less than 16's critical value (2.131), which is higher than 18's (2.110). So, the test statistic is more extreme than 18's critical value. So the conclusion is that the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value for 18 df, so he doesn't reject the null.

Wait, but the critical value for 18 df is approximately 2.110. So 1.973 is less than that. So the test statistic is less extreme than 18's critical value. So the correct conclusion is that it's not in the rejection region.

Looking at the options, the correct reasoning is that the test statistic is less extreme than the critical value for 16 degrees of freedom. Because 1.973 < 2.131 (critical for 16), it's not in the 16's region. So, the correct option is F.

So the correct conclusion is option F. So the farmer doesn't reject the null hypothesis.
</think>

The question involves a farmer testing whether the mean mass of his hens is 56 grams using a t-test at a 5% significance level. The test statistic is -1.973, and the degrees of freedom are 17. The critical t-value for a two-tailed test at 5% significance level (α = 0.05) is approximately 2.110 for 17 degrees of freedom. 

**Analysis:**

- The t-statistic of -1.973 has an absolute value of 1.973.
- The critical t-value for a two-tailed test at 5% significance level is 2.110 (for 17 degrees of freedom).
- Since the absolute value of the t-statistic (1.973) is less than the critical t-value (2.110), the test statistic does not fall into the rejection region.
- Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the farmer does not reject the null hypothesis.

**Option Evaluation:**

- **Option F:** Correct. Because the test statistic is less extreme than the critical value for 16 degrees of freedom, the farmer does not reject the null hypothesis.
- **Other Options:** Incorrect. The other options either incorrectly state the critical value or confuse the two-tailed and one-tailed tests.

**Answer:** F
