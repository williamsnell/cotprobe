Question:

Why is a retail sales tax of 4% not proportional but regressive?

Options:

A: The 4% retail sales tax decreases in percentage as the amount spent on consumption increases.
B: The 4% retail sales tax is regressive because it applies only to luxury goods, which lower income groups do not purchase.
C: The 4% retail sales tax is a flat tax, so it affects all income groups equally.
D: Lower income groups receive a subsidy that offsets the 4% retail sales tax.
E: Higher income groups pay more retail sales tax because they have more income.
F: Higher income groups are taxed at a higher rate with the 4% retail sales tax.
G: Lower income groups are exempt from the 4% retail sales tax.
H: The 4% retail sales tax is proportional because everyone pays the same rate.
I: The 4% retail sales tax is adjusted based on the buyer's income level, with higher incomes paying a lower percentage.
J: A 4% retail sales tax is regressive because lower income groups spend a greater proportion of their income on consumption, resulting in a higher effective rate of taxation for them compared to higher income groups.

Okay, so I have this question about why a 4% retail sales tax isn't proportional and is regressive. Hmm, I remember that taxes can be progressive, regressive, or proportional based on how they're applied. Let me think through this.

Progressive taxes have higher rates for higher earners. Regressive taxes have lower rates for lower earners. Proportional taxes are flat, same percentage for everyone.

The question is about why 4% isn't proportional. Proportional would mean everyone pays the same rate, but in reality, people's incomes vary. So higher earners might have more disposable income, which could mean they can afford a higher tax rate. But 4% is fixed, so it's probably not proportional.

Now the question is why it's regressive. Regressive means lower-income groups are taxed at a lower rate. But wait, the sales tax is on the consumer's purchases. So lower-income people might spend more on things like food, which could increase their tax burden. So the tax is taken from their income, making them pay a higher percentage because they spend more. That's why it's regressive.

Looking at the options:

Option F says higher income groups are taxed at a higher rate. But that's the opposite of what I'm thinking. Higher income groups would pay more in tax, so F would be progressive, not regressive. So F is incorrect.

Option A: 4% decreases as consumption increases. Wait, that's a different point. Some goods have higher tax rates, others lower. So 4% is fixed, not decreasing. So A is incorrect.

Option B: It's regressive because only luxury goods are taxed. No, that's not right. The tax is on all consumption, not just luxury. So B is incorrect.

Option C: It's a flat tax. So everyone pays the same. That's not the reason it's regressive. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Lower income groups get a subsidy. No, the sales tax is part of the tax, not a subsidy. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Higher income groups pay more. That's progressive, but the tax isn't. So E is incorrect.

Option J: This says the lower-income groups spend more on consumption. That would mean they pay a higher percentage of their income in tax. So yes, that fits with regressive.

So the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J. A 4% retail sales tax is regressive because lower-income groups spend a greater proportion of their income on consumption, resulting in a higher effective rate of taxation for them compared to higher-income groups.
