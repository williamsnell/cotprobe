Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the formulas. But let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a baseball pitcher throwing a ball. The ball weighs 1/3 pound, and the acceleration is 480 feet per second squared. They're asking how much force the pitcher applies to the ball. The options are A through J, with various force values.

Hmm, wait a second. The ball's weight is given as 1/3 pound. I'm a bit confused because usually, when we talk about force, we use mass times acceleration, but here it's given as weight. Oh right, weight is mass times gravity. So maybe I should convert that weight to mass first.

Wait, but wait another thing. The formula for force is F = mass * acceleration. But here, the mass is given in pounds and the acceleration is in feet per second squared. Oh, right! But in the English system, pounds (lb) is a unit of force, not mass. Wait, no, actually, pounds are a unit of force. So if I'm using the correct units, I can directly use the formula F = m * a, but I have to make sure the units match.

Wait, the pitcher throws the ball with an acceleration of 480 ft/s². The ball's weight is 1/3 lb. Wait, but weight is force. So maybe the mass of the ball is weight divided by gravity. Since we're using the English system, the acceleration due to gravity is 32 ft/s².

So the weight of the ball is 1/3 lb. Weight is mass times gravity, so mass = weight / g. So mass = (1/3 lb) / 32 ft/s². But wait, the unit of mass would be lb/(ft/s²), but then when you multiply by acceleration, it's (lb/(ft/s²)) * (ft/s²) = lb, which is correct for force.

But wait, the question is about the force the pitcher applies. So the force would be the change in momentum over time, which is mass times acceleration. So F = m * a.

Alternatively, since the ball is moving from rest (assuming it's thrown from a stationary position), the acceleration is the same as the force applied divided by the mass. So F = m * a.

But let me get the numbers straight. The ball's weight is 1/3 lb. Since weight is mass times gravity, m = weight / g. So m = (1/3 lb) / 32 ft/s². Then F = m * a = (1/3 lb /32 ft/s²) *480 ft/s².

Calculating that: (1/3 * 480) / 32. Let's compute numerator first: 480 divided by 3 is 160. Then 160 divided by 32 is 5. So F is 5 pounds of force.

Wait, looking back at the options, option G is 5 lbs. So the answer should be G. But wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me double-check.

Another approach: Since force is mass times acceleration, and the weight is mass times g. So the mass is W/g, which is (1/3 lb) /32 ft/s². Then F = (1/3 lb /32) *480. That's (1/3 *480) /32 = (160) /32 =5 lb. So yes, that's correct.

So the force applied is 5 pounds. So the correct option is G.

To determine the force applied by the pitcher, we use the formula for force, \( F = m \cdot a \), where \( m \) is the mass of the ball and \( a \) is the acceleration. The mass of the ball can be calculated from its weight using the formula \( m = \frac{W}{g} \), where \( W \) is the weight and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (32 ft/s² in the English system).

Given:
- Weight (\( W \)) = \( \frac{1}{3} \) lb
- Acceleration (\( a \)) = 480 ft/s²

First, calculate the mass:
\[
m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{\frac{1}{3} \text{ lb}}{32 \text{ ft/s}^2} = \frac{1}{96} \text{ lb/s}^2
\]

Now, calculate the force:
\[
F = m \cdot a = \frac{1}{96} \text{ lb/s}^2 \cdot 480 \text{ ft/s}^2 = \frac{480}{96} \text{ lb} = 5 \text{ lb}
\]

Thus, the force applied by the pitcher is 5 pounds.
