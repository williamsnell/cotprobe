Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that one cubic millimeter of oil is spread out on water, forming a film with an area of 1 square meter. I'm supposed to find the thickness of the oil film in angstroms. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, alright. So, I remember that when you spread a volume of liquid over a certain area, the volume should be equal to the area multiplied by the thickness. Right, so volume equals area times thickness. So, I can write that as V = A * t.

Wait, the volume here is 1 cubic millimeter. Oh wait, but the area is 1 square meter. I need to make sure all the units match up because volume is in mm³ and area is m². So I have to convert them to the same units before multiplying.

Let me think about the units. 1 cubic millimeter is 1 mm³. 1 square meter is 1 m². I need to convert either volume to m³ or area to mm². Let's see.

So, 1 m² is (100 cm)² = 10,000 cm². And 1 cm³ is (10 mm)³ = 1000 mm³. So 1 m² equals 10,000 * 1000 mm². Wait, because 1 m² is 100 cm * 100 cm. And each cm is 10 mm, so each cm² is (10 mm)^2 = 100 mm². So 1 m² is 100 cm * 100 cm = 10,000 cm². Each cm² is 100 mm², so 10,000 cm² * 100 mm²/cm² = 1,000,000 mm². So, 1 m² is 1,000,000 mm².

Okay, so the oil volume is 1 mm³, and the area is 1 m² which is 1e6 mm². Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. If I have 1 cubic millimeter, that's 1 mm³. Let's see.

Wait, the volume is V = 1 mm³. The area is A = 1 m². So, V = A * t → t = V / A. So t = (1 mm³) / (1 m²). But wait, the units don't match, so I need to convert either the numerator or the denominator to the same units.

Let me think about the units. So 1 mm³ is 1e-9 m³ (since 1 m³ = 1e9 mm³). But wait, if I have V = 1 mm³, and A = 1 m², then t = (1 mm³) / (1 m²) = 1e-9 m³ / 1 m² = 1e-9 m. Because m² cancels with m², leaving m in the denominator. So t is 1e-9 meters.

Wait, but I need to find the thickness in angstroms. Because 1 meter is 1e10 angstroms (since 1 m = 1e10 Å, because 1 Å is 1e-10 m). So, 1e-9 meters is 1e-9 m * 1e10 Å/m. That's 1e1 Å. Wait, 1e-9 * 1e10 = 10 angstroms.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Let me think again. t = V / A.

V is 1 mm³. A is 1 m².

Let me convert V to m³. 1 mm³ is (1e-3 m)^3 = 1e-9 m³.

A is 1 m².

So, t = (1e-9 m³) / (1 m²) = 1e-9 m.

Because 1e-9 meters. So 1e-9 meters in angstroms.

Since 1 m = 1e10 Å, because 1 Å is 1e-10 m. So, 1e-9 m = 1e-9 * 1e10 Å = 1e1 Å = 10 Å.

Wait, but wait, the options are all in angstroms. Let me look again.

Options are A:200, B:1, C:0.1, D:50, E:500, F:1500, G:1000, H:10, I:100, J:5.

So the calculation gives 10 Å, which is option H. Wait, but wait. What's the problem? Because I thought the oil film is spread on the water, so the volume is 1 mm³. So, t = V/A. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait another approach: Maybe I should convert the area from m² to mm². Because 1 m² is 1e6 mm² (since 1 m = 1e3 mm, so (1e3 mm)^2 = 1e6 mm²).

Wait, volume is 1 mm³. So area is 1e6 mm². So thickness t is V/A = 1 mm³ / (1e6 mm²) = 1e-6 mm. Because mm³ divided by mm² is mm.

So, t = 1e-6 mm. But wait, 1 mm is 1e3 Å (since 1 mm = 1e2 cm, and 1 cm = 1e7 Å, because 1 cm = 1e8 Å → wait, no, 1 cm is 10 mm, which is 1e2 mm. So, 1 mm is 1e-1 m, but in terms of angstroms: 1 m = 1e10 Å, so 1 mm = 1e-1 * 1e10 = 1e9 Å. So, 1 mm = 1e9 Å.

Wait, wait, let's make this correctly. 1 m = 1e2 cm. 1 cm = 1e7 Å (because 1 Å is 1e-10 m, so 1 m = 1e10 Å). So, 1 cm = 1e7 Å, because 1 cm is 0.01 m = 1e-2 m. So, 1e-2 m = 1e-2 * 1e10 Å = 1e8 Å. Wait, but that's 1 cm = 1e7 Å? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think of it another way.

1 cm = 0.01 meters. 1 meter is 1e10 Å, so 1 cm is 0.01 * 1e10 = 1e8 Å. Wait, wait that would mean 1 cm is 1e8 Å. But that can't be right because 1 cm is 10 mm, so 1 mm is 1e7 Å. Let me check that.

Wait, 1 m = 1e10 Å. So, 1 m = 100 cm. So, 1 cm = 1 m / 100 = 1e10 / 100 = 1e8 Å. So yes, 1 cm equals 1e8 Å. So 1 mm is 1e7 Å because 1 mm is 1e-3 m. So 1e-3 m = 1e-3 * 1e10 Å = 1e7 Å.

So, 1 mm = 1e7 Å.

So, back to the thickness t.

t = 1 mm³ / (1 m²) → volume V is 1 mm³, area A is 1 m².

So, V = 1 mm³, A = 1 m².

t = 1 mm³ / 1 m² = 1e-6 mm.

Because 1 mm³ is 1e-6 mm² * mm.

Wait, another approach. Let's write all the units in terms of base SI units, then convert to angstroms.

V = 1 mm³ = (1e-3 m)^3 = 1e-9 m³.

A = 1 m².

t = V / A = (1e-9 m³) / (1 m²) = 1e-9 m.

Now, 1 m is 1e10 Å, so 1e-9 m = 1e-9 * 1e10 Å = 1e1 Å, which is 10 Å. So the thickness is 10 angstroms.

Looking at the options, option H is 10 Å. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Another way to compute is to convert area to mm².

Wait, 1 m² = 1e6 mm². Because 1 m = 1e3 mm, so (1e3 mm)^2 = 1e6 mm².

So, area A = 1 m² = 1e6 mm².

Volume V = 1 mm³.

So, the thickness t is V / A = 1 mm³ / (1e6 mm²) = 1e-6 mm.

Because 1 mm³ divided by 1e6 mm² is 1e-6 mm.

But 1 mm is 1e7 Å. So, 1e-6 mm = 1e-6 * 1e7 Å = 1e1 Å. Again, 10 angstroms.

So, yeah, t is 10 Å, which is option H.

To determine the thickness of the oil film, we use the relationship between volume, area, and thickness: 

\[
V = A \cdot t
\]

Rearranging for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{V}{A}
\]

### Given:
- Volume of oil: \( V = 1 \, \text{mm}^3 \)
- Area of the oil film: \( A = 1 \, \text{m}^2 \)

### Unit Conversion:
1. Convert \( V \) and \( A \) to compatible units:
   - \( 1 \, \text{mm}^3 = (1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m})^3 = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^3 \)
   - \( 1 \, \text{m}^2 = 1 \times 10^6 \, \text{mm}^2 \)

2. Calculate \( t \):
   \[
   t = \frac{1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^3}{1 \times 10^6 \, \text{mm}^2} = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}
   \]

3. Convert \( t \) to angstroms (\( 1 \, \text{m} = 1 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Å} \)):
   \[
   t = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \times 1 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Å/m} = 10 \, \text{Å}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The thickness of the oil film is \( 10 \, \text{Å} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
