Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry can be tricky. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The question is about the reaction between silicon dust (Si) and oxygen (O2) to form silicon dioxide (SiO2). I need to find out how much of the O2 remains unreacted after the reaction goes to completion.

The given data is: 10.0 grams of Si and 100.0 grams of O2. The reaction equation is Si + O2 → SiO2. Right, I remember that for stoichiometry problems, the key steps are to balance the equation, convert grams of reactants to moles, find the limiting reagent, and then calculate the remaining O2.

First, I should balance the equation. Let's see: Si is Si, O2 is O2, and SiO2 is SiO2. So, each molecule of SiO2 has one Si and two O atoms. So, the reaction should be balanced as Si + O2 → SiO2. Wait, that's already balanced because Si is one on each side, and O2 to O in SiO2. So the equation is already balanced correctly.

Next, I need to find the moles of each reactant. I'm going to use the molar masses for this. The molar mass of Si is approximately 28.09 g/mol. Oxygen is 32.00 g/mol. Let me compute each.

Moles of Si: 10.0 g / 28.09 g/mol ≈ 0.356 mol.
Moles of O2: 100.0 g / 32.00 g/mol = 3.125 mol.

Wait, wait, wait. O2 is a diatomic molecule, so each mole is 32 g. So that's correct.

Now, the reaction is 1:1 for Si and O2. So, each mole of Si reacts with one mole of O2. How much of each is available?

So, we have 0.356 mol of Si and 3.125 mol of O2. Since the ratio is 1:1, the limiting reagent is the one with the smaller amount. So, Si is the limiting reagent. That means Si will be completely consumed, and O2 will have some left.

So, the amount of O2 that reacts is equal to the amount of Si, which is 0.356 mol. Because each mole of Si reacts with a mole of O2. So, the initial O2 is 3.125 mol. After reaction, it will be 3.125 - 0.356 = ?

Wait, let me compute that. 3.125 minus 0.356 is 2.769 mol. Oh wait, no. Wait, 3.125 minus 0.356. Let me do the subtraction.

3.125 - 0.356: 3.125 minus 0.3 is 2.825, then minus 0.056 is 2.769 mol. So, 2.769 mol of O2 remains unreacted.

Wait, but wait a second, what about the moles of O2 after reaction? Let me double-check the calculation. 3.125 minus 0.356 is:

3.125
-0.356
= 2.769

Yes, that's correct. So, 2.769 moles of O2 are left.

But wait, the question asks for the grams of O2 that remain unreacted. So I need to convert moles back to grams.

Molar mass of O2 is 32.00 g/mol. So 2.769 mol * 32.00 g/mol = ?

Let me compute that. 2.769 *32.00. Let me do the math step by step. 2 *32=64; 0.7 *32=22.4; 0.069 *32= 2.208. So total is 64 +22.4=86.4 + 2.208=88.608 grams.

Wait, wait, but let me do it more accurately.

2.769 *32 = (2 + 0.7 + 0.069) *32 = 2*32=64, 0.7 *32=22.4, 0.069 *32=2.208. Sum is 64 + 22.4=86.4, +2.208=88.608 grams. So approximately 88.6 g of O2 remains unreacted.

Looking at the options: Option B is 88.5 g, which is very close. So the answer should be option B.

To determine how many grams of O₂ remain unreacted when 10.0 g of Si reacts with 100.0 g of O₂ to form SiO₂, the following steps are performed:

1. **Write the balanced reaction**:  
   \[
   \text{Si} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{SiO}_2
   \]  
   The equation is already balanced.

2. **Calculate the moles of each reactant**:  
   - Molar mass of Si = 28.09 g/mol.  
     Moles of Si = \(\frac{10.0}{28.09} \approx 0.356 \, \text{mol}\).  
   - Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.  
     Moles of O₂ = \(\frac{100.0}{32.00} = 3.125 \, \text{mol}\).

3. **Identify the limiting reagent**:  
   The reaction requires 1 mole of Si to react with 1 mole of O₂. Since there is only 0.356 mol of Si, it is the limiting reagent. All 0.356 mol of Si will react, consuming 0.356 mol of O₂.

4. **Determine the moles of O₂ remaining**:  
   Initial moles of O₂ = 3.125 mol.  
   Moles of O₂ that react = 0.356 mol (equal to the moles of Si).  
   Remaining moles of O₂ = \(3.125 - 0.356 = 2.769 \, \text{mol}\).

5. **Convert moles of remaining O₂ to grams**:  
   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.  
   Mass of remaining O₂ = \(2.769 \times 32.00 \approx 88.608 \, \text{g}\).

6. **Match the closest option**:  
   The calculated mass of remaining O₂ (approximately 88.6 g) matches option B (88.5 g).
