Okay, so I've got this question about utilitarianism and Mill's response to someone saying it's a bad doctrine because it's for swine. Hmm, I remember that Mill was a proponent of utilitarianism, right? But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what Mill would say pleasures differ in. The options are various terms like cost, weight, etc. I think Mill was against certain aspects of utilitarianism, especially those that are impractical or require excessive effort. So, he might be objecting to things that are too practical or require much effort, maybe.

Wait, I remember that Mill opposed treating pleasure as a simple utility, especially when it's too practical. Like, he thought that the intensity of pleasure would vary depending on the individual and the situation. Oh, wait, but the options don't directly mention 'intensity.' Let me look back. The options are A-J, with answers ranging from cost to duration.

Wait, the question is about what Mill responds pleasures differ in. So Mill might be referring to something like 'practicality' or 'intensity.' Alternatively, perhaps Mill thought that the utility of an action isn't just based on the sum of all pleasures but also on the practicality of achieving them. So if someone says it's a doctrine for swine, Mill might say that it's impractical because swine are less likely to comply with policies, decisions, etc., that utilitarianism would require.

Wait, but the options are more about the nature of pleasures. So, Mill might have a response about the intensity of pleasure. Or perhaps the intensity is a problem. Or maybe Mill thought that the utility of an action is not just about the sum of all the pleasant things but also about the practicality of achieving them. Hmm.

Alternatively, another angle: Mill was critical of utilitarianism for treating pleasure as a simple, unidimensional measure. He believed that the value of an action is not just the sum of its pleasures but also the effort and practicality required. So, if someone says utilitarianism is for swine, Mill might say that the intensity of the pleasure is a problem because swines are more likely to be affected by the outcomes of decisions, not to comply with them.

Wait, but the question is about what Mill would respond, not about the response itself. The options are about what the difference is in terms of the qualities of the pleasures. So, perhaps Mill didn't think that the intensity is a problem, but that the practicality, like in the case of swines, is a problem.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about Mill's arguments. Mill argued that the principal value of an action is the sum of the utilities of its consequences, but he also thought that if the consequences are too practical (e.g., a policy that only swine would comply with), then the sum of the utilities might not be what is really important.

So, in considering whether a particular action is good, Mill would weigh the sum of the benefits (like the utility of swine complying with the action) against the practicality of the action. He might argue that even if a policy is good in terms of utility, if it's impractical (like swines wouldn't comply), then it's not worth pursuing.

So, if someone asks why utilitarianism is a bad doctrine for swines, Mill would say something like, "Because the pleasures (or benefits) are too intense in this case, and you canâ€™t gain them by pursuing such an action." But wait, the options don't directly mention 'intensity.' Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A: cost.
B: weight.
C: species.
D: purity.
E: morality.
F: frequency.
G: quality.
H: practicality.
I: intensity.
J: duration.

Oh, 'intensity' isn't an option. So perhaps the question is referring to 'practicality.' Because Mill focused on practicality as a problem with utilitarianism.

Wait, but in the options, the closest is H: practicality. So maybe the correct answer is H: practicality.

Wait, but another thought: in considering the intensity of the utility, maybe Mill said that the intensity didn't matter as much, or that it's only about the sum, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps Mill thought that the pleasure itself is too intense, so he says that the pleasures differ in intensity.

Alternatively, if the question is about what Mill responds, perhaps Mill says that the pleasures are of no value because they are too intense or impractical. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the right answer is about practicality.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options don't include 'intensity.' The options are A-J, and the correct answer is supposed to be one of them.

Wait, I think I remember that Mill's main criticism of utilitarianism is that it's too focused on the sum of pleasures and not on the practicality. So if someone uses utilitarianism for swines, Mill would say that the pleasures are 'too intense' or 'practical' because swines are less likely to comply, so it's impractical.

So, the 'difference' in terms of practicality. So the answer would be H: practicality.

Wait, but let me think again. So the options are:

H: practicality.

So, the correct answer is H: practicality.

The question concerns Mill's response to the claim that utilitarianism is a doctrine suitable for swines. Mill, a proponent of utilitarianism, argues against treating pleasures as a simple, unidimensional measure. He emphasizes the practicality of an action, particularly when the outcomes are not easily achieved by swines. He suggests that the intensity or practicality of the pleasures is a critical factor. Since 'intensity' is not an option, the closest equivalent is 'practicality.' Therefore, Mill would respond that the pleasures differ in practicality.

Answer: H
