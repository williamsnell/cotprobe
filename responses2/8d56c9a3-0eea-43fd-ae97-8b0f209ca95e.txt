This question refers to the following information.
"MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:â€”
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal."
Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921

Answer:

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the historical developments that helped the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph of Mahatma Gandhi's letters. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is asking which of the given options was the most important historical development that assisted the ultimate success of the boycott. The options are A through J, each representing a different event.

First, I need to recall the context of the fifth paragraph in Gandhi's letters. It talks about a boycott against foreign cloth and spinning. He expressed a strong commitment to non-violent resistance and refused to be interrupted by the forces of madness. He also mentioned the Swadeshi movement and the Swaraj movement.

Now, I'm thinking about the political context at the time. During the 1920s, India was undergoing a period of change. I remember that the Anti-Inductive Movement (AIM) was a key part of the Indian independence struggle, but that's not directly related here.

Gandhi's own actions were significant. He refused to be interrupted by colonial powers, which was a big deal because the British were still in power. His message to Waltair was about stopping the colonial forces, which led to the Indian National Congress (INDC) gaining political influence. That's option A.

Wait, but the question is about the boycott. The fifth paragraph is about the boycott, not the movement itself. So, the event that caused the boycott was his refusal to be interrupted. The broader political movement started with the INDAC, which I think was in the late 1920s. So, the key development was the INDAC gaining political power, which was part of the broader anti-colonial movement.

Looking at the options, option A is about the Indian National Congress gaining political influence. That's the most direct link to the boycott, as it's the movement that supported Gandhi's call to stop colonial rule.

Other options: Option B is industrialization. That's more about economic change. Option C is communism in Asia, but I don't think Gandhi was involved with that. Option D is WWII, which happened after the 1920s. Option E is partition in 1947, but that was a century later and not directly related to the 1921 boycott. Option F is the aftermath of WWII, which happened after 1921. Option G is the civil rights movement in the US, which was in the 20th century. Option H is decolonization in Africa, which happened later. Option I is the Great Depression, which was before 1929, so that's before the 1921 issue. Option J is Soviet pressure on colonial powers. That's a form of colonial resistance, which Gandhi didn't support.

So, the correct answer is A: The Indian National Congress gaining political influence. Because it was the political force that led to Gandhi's refusing to be interrupted, which was part of the broader movement that started the boycott.

The correct answer is A: The Indian National Congress gaining political influence. This development was the most significant in facilitating Gandhi's decision to refuse interruptions from colonial powers, which was crucial for the establishment of the boycott against foreign cloth and spinning. It was part of the broader anti-colonial movement that began with the Indian National Congress, which later led to Gandhi's calls for non-violent resistance.

Answer: A
