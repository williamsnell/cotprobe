Alright, let me try to figure this out. Okay, so there's this question about microarchitecture, specifically horizontal versus vertical. Hmm. I remember that microarchitecture refers to the details of how a processor's central processing unit (CPU) operates, like the number of registers, the number of micro-instructions, and how they're encoded.

So the question has three statements, I, II, III, and asks which are true. The options are combinations of these statements.

Let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement I: "Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures." I think horizontal microinstructions are more complex. Each horizontal microinstruction has a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers. That's different from vertical micro-instructions, which have multiple opcodes and a single operand. So programs that use horizontal micro-instructions might take more time steps because each step has more data. I'm pretty sure I remember that horizontal is more efficient in terms of instruction count but takes more steps. So I think statement I is true.

Statement II: "Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded." Wait, no. I think horizontal microinstructions are encoded. Each has a single opcode (like "add") and multiple operands. So statement II says they're unencoded, which I don't think is correct. So II is false.

Statement III: "Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers." Yep, that's exactly what I mentioned earlier. So III is true.

So looking at the options, which statements are correct? I (true), II (false), III (true). So the correct options are I and III.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. What about statement II again? Are horizontal microinstructions unencoded? No, I think they are properly encoded. Each has a single opcode and multiple operands. So II is false.

So which options include I and III? Let's see the options:

A: I and III only → this would be correct if I and III are both true. 

B: I, II and III → includes II, which is false, so B is incorrect.

C: III only → doesn't include I, which is correct, so C is wrong.

D: I and II → includes II which is false, so D is wrong.

E: All of the above → includes II as false, so E is incorrect.

F: II only → incorrect for same reason.

G: II and III → incorrect.

H: I only → Incorrect because III is correct.

So the only correct option is A: I and III only.

Wait, but I thought about the micro-instruction counts. Oh right, horizontal micro-instructions have fewer in total but more steps. So yes, I is correct. III is correct. So the answer should be A.
</think>

The correct answer is A: I and III only. 

- **Statement I** is true because horizontal micro-instructions require more time steps due to their structure.
- **Statement II** is false because horizontal micro-instructions are not unencoded; they are properly structured.
- **Statement III** is true as it describes the typical structure of horizontal micro-instructions.

Thus, only statements I and III are correct, making the correct option A.

**Answer: A**
