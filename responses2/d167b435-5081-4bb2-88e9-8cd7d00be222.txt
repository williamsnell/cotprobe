Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about sound waves. Let's see. The question says that a sound wave with frequency f travels through air at speed v. Then it asks what speed a sound wave with frequency 4f would travel at through the same air.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of sound in air depends on the temperature and the properties of the air, but I think the formula is v = f * λ, where λ is the wavelength. Oh right, and the wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency. So λ = v/f. So if the frequency is quadrupled, the wavelength would be v/(4f).

Wait, but the question is about the speed of the sound wave itself. Oh wait, no, the speed of sound is a constant at a given temperature, right? So regardless of the frequency, the speed of sound doesn't change. Like, if you have a certain amount of air, the speed can't change with frequency, it's a property of the medium.

So the speed of sound in air is v = f * λ. But if the frequency changes, the wavelength changes accordingly, but the speed of sound v is determined by the medium, not the frequency. So for air, v is a constant. So a 4f wave would still move at the same speed v.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: Maybe the question is about the speed of the wave, which would involve frequency and wavelength. Oh, but the speed of a wave is generally given by v = f * λ. But in this case, since the medium (air) is the same, the speed of the wave (how fast it travels through the medium) is fixed. So regardless of frequency, the speed remains v.

So if the original wave is f and speed is v, then 4f would still have speed v. So the answer should be v. Looking at the options, option H says v. So the correct answer is H.

The speed of a sound wave in air is a characteristic of the medium and is independent of the wave's frequency. Since the question specifies air as the medium, the speed of the sound wave remains constant at \( v \). Therefore, the sound wave with frequency \( 4f \) will travel at the same speed \( v \).

Answer: H: v
