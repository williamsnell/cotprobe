Okay, I've got this physics problem here about calculating the density of a block of wood. Hmm, let me think. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So I need to find the volume of the block first.

The dimensions given are 25 cm, 0.10 m, and 50.0 m. Wait, I should convert all of them to the same unit because density is in grams per cubic centimeter or grams per milliliter. Oh, right, because grams per cubic centimeter is grams per milliliter, which is easier to handle.

So let's convert all to centimeters. 25 cm is already in centimeters. 0.10 meters is 10 centimeters because 1 m is 100 cm, so 0.1 * 100 = 10 cm. And 50.0 meters would be 5000 cm (since 50 * 100 = 5000).

So the dimensions are 25 cm × 10 cm × 5000 cm. Now, the volume is length × width × height. So volume equals 25 * 10 * 5000. Let me calculate that.

First, 25 * 10 is 250. Then, 250 * 5000. Let's see, 250 * 5000. Well, 250 * 5 is 1250, so 250 * 5000 is 1,250,000 cm³. That's 1.25 × 10⁶ cm³.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait a second. I think I made a mistake there. Because 25 cm × 10 cm ×5000 cm. Wait, 25 *10 is 250, times 5000 is 1,250,000 cm³. That's correct. So the volume is 1.25e6 cm³, which is 1250,000 cm³.

Wait, no, wait again. 25 cm × 10 cm = 250 cm². Then 250 cm² *5000 cm = 1,250,000 cm³. Oh yeah, that's correct.

Now, the mass is given as 750 kg. Oh, but wait, I need to convert that to grams because the volume is in cm³. I know that 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 750 kg is 750,000 grams.

Density is mass divided by volume. So 750,000 grams divided by 1,250,000 cm³.

Let me compute that. 750,000 / 1,250,000 = 0.6. Because 1,250,000 is 2.0833 times 750,000. Wait no, 750,000 divided by 1.25e6 is 0.6.

So density is 0.6 grams per cm³. Wait, but wait, the units. Because 1 cm³ is a milliliter, so grams per cc is same as g/mL. So 0.6 g/cm³ is 0.6 g/mL.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: 1.00 g/cm³ → too high.
B: .70 → nope.
C: .60 → this matches.
D: 0.40 → nope.
E: 0.45 → nope.
F: .80 → no.
G: 0.30 → no.
H: .50 → no.
I: 0.75 → no.
J: 0.90 → no.

So the correct answer is C: .60 g/cm³.

To calculate the density of the block of wood, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
\]

### Step 1: Convert Units
The dimensions of the block are given as 25 cm, 0.10 m, and 50.0 m. Since the density is expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³), we convert all dimensions to centimeters:
- \( 25 \, \text{cm} \) remains \( 25 \, \text{cm} \).
- \( 0.10 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{cm} \).
- \( 50.0 \, \text{m} = 5000 \, \text{cm} \).

### Step 2: Calculate Volume
The volume of the block is:
\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 25 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 5000 \, \text{cm} = 1,250,000 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 3: Convert Mass to Grams
The mass of the block is given as \( 750 \, \text{kg} \). Converting to grams:
\[
750 \, \text{kg} = 750,000 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Density
Now, calculate the density:
\[
\text{Density} = \frac{750,000 \, \text{g}}{1,250,000 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.6 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The calculated density of \( 0.6 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \) matches option **C: 0.60 g/cm³**.
