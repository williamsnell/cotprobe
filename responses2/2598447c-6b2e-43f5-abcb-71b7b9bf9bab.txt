Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about efficiency. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that 100 J are put into a device that gives out 40 J of useful work. They're asking for the efficiency of the device. I remember that efficiency is the ratio of useful work done to the total work input. Oh wait, right, efficiency (η) is calculated as η = (Work Output)/(Work Input).

So, the work input is 100 J and output is 40 J. Plugging in the numbers, I get 40/100. Let's see, 40 divided by 100 is 0.4, which is 40%. 

Looking at the options, option H is 40%. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes, people confuse efficiency with something else, like power or something else. But the question clearly states it's about work, so efficiency is definitely work output over work input. 

Another thing to consider: efficiency can't be more than 100%, which 100% is option B. So 40% is less than 100%, so that makes sense. Could there be any other factors here? Like is there any energy being converted elsewhere, but the question doesn't mention that, so I think it's just about the given numbers. 

So yeah, I'm pretty confident it's 40%, which is option H.

The efficiency (η) of the device is calculated as the ratio of useful work output to the total work input. Given 100 J input and 40 J output, η = 40/100 = 0.4, which is 40%. 

Answer: H
