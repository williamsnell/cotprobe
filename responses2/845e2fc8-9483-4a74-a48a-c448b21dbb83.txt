Okay, so I have this problem here about Roya buying orange juice. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says Roya paid $48 for 12 cartons. I need to find the unit rate, which is the cost per carton. Hmm, unit rate usually means figuring out how much one item costs. So, I should divide the total cost by the number of items to get the cost per item.

Let me write that down. The total cost is $48, and the number of cartons is 12. So, I need to calculate 48 divided by 12. Let me do that math. 48 divided by 12 equals 4. So each carton costs $4. 

Wait, but let me double-check. If 12 cartons cost $48, then 1 carton is 48/12. Yep, that's 4. So the unit rate is $4 per carton. 

Looking at the options, option D is $4. So that must be the correct answer.

The unit rate is the cost per carton. 

**Step 1:** Divide the total cost by the number of cartons.

**Step 2:** 
\[
\text{Unit rate} = \frac{48}{12} = 4
\]

**Step 3:** The unit rate is $4 per carton.

**Answer:** D: $4
