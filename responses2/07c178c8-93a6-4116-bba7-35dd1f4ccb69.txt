Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility and Ksp. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says a chemist dissolves PbS in water. They give K_sp as 1 × 10^-28 and ask for the molarity of each ion in solution. The options are A to J, with various values from 1e-28 down to 1e-14. Hmm, I need to find the solubility of PbS in water and then determine the ion concentrations.

Wait, I remember that when a sparingly soluble salt dissolves, it dissociates into its ions. For PbS, the dissolution equation should be PbS(s) ⇌ Pb²+ (aq) + S²- (aq). Right, because lead usually has a +2 charge and sulfide is -2.

So, the solubility product K_sp is [Pb²+][S²-] = 1e-28. But since the dissolution is 1:1, the concentrations of Pb²+ and S²- should be equal. Let's let the solubility be 's'. Then, [Pb²+] = s and [S²-] = s. So substituting into Ksp: s * s = s² = 1e-28.

To find 's', I take the square root of 1e-28. The square root of 1e-28 is 1e-14. So, s is 1e-14 M. That means both ions have a concentration of 1e-14 M. Let me look at the options. Option C is 1e-14 M, and option F is also 2e-14, but wait, no, F is 2e-14. Wait, no, looking again: Option F is 2 × 10^-14 M. Wait, no, looking at the list:

Wait the options are:

A: 5e-15

B:1e-7

C:1e-14

D:4e-14

E:3e-28

F:2e-14

G:6e-7

H:1e-28

I:5e-14

J:2e-7

So, the correct concentration is 1e-14 M for Pb²+ and S²-. So looking at the options, option C is 1e-14, so that's Pb²+ and S²- each 1e-14 M. But wait, the question says "the last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen." Oh, so perhaps the answer isn't just the letter but also the correct value.

Wait, no, the options are the molarity values. So the correct answer should be the one where both ions have the same concentration. So the correct option is C, which is 1e-14 M.

To determine the molarity of each ion in solution when PbS dissolves in water, we start with the dissociation equation: 

\[
\text{PbS(s)} \leftrightharpoons \text{Pb}^{2+} (aq) + \text{S}^{2-} (aq)
\]

From the problem, the solubility product \( K_{sp} \) is \( 1 \times 10^{-28} \). Assuming the solubility of PbS in water is \( s \), the equilibrium concentrations of the ions are:

\[
[\text{Pb}^{2+}] = [\text{S}^{2-}] = s
\]

Substituting into the expression for \( K_{sp} \):

\[
K_{sp} = s^2 = 1 \times 10^{-28}
\]

Solving for \( s \):

\[
s = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{-28}} = 1 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentrations of both \( \text{Pb}^{2+} \) and \( \text{S}^{2-} \) ions are \( 1 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{M} \). Among the given options, the correct concentration for each ion is:

- **C: \( 1 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{M} \)**

ANSWER: C
