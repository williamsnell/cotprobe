Okay, so I have this question about maturation and its role in human behavior. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking me to define maturation and explain how it's the basis for much of human behavior. I remember that maturation refers to the process of change or development over time. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact aspects. Let me think about what I know.

Maturation in biology often refers to an organism moving towards maturity, which is when an individual reaches a certain stage in their development. For example, humans mature from infancy to old age. But how does this relate to behavior? Well, as someone ages, they might make less spontaneous decisions, like delaying decisions to start a new job or family. That's a form of maturation in behavior.

Looking at the options, option E says: "Maturation is the development of bodily processes and the changes in behavior that result from such development." That sounds pretty accurate. Maturation isn't just about physical changes; it's about behavioral changes. So as an individual ages, their bodily processes change, leading to more routine behaviors.

Another option is option A, which talks about education and experience. While maturation can involve learning, I think it's broader than just education. It's more about the natural progression of an individual's life stages. So maybe option E is the better fit.

Option C mentions reaching physical peak performance, which is a specific aspect but not the overall basis for behavior change. So that's more about health than maturation itself.

Option H is about learning new skills, but maturation isn't just about acquiring new skills; it's about the natural progression of existing skills and behaviors.

Option F is about intellectual abilities without learning. I think maturation does involve learning, like in education and skill development. So F might not be the best choice.

Option E seems to capture both the development in bodily processes and the resulting changes in behavior. That makes sense because maturation isn't just about physical parts but how behaviors change over time.

Wait, what about option I? It says it's about personal choices. That's part of maturation, but it's more about the process of personal development leading to more deliberate choices, which is a part of maturation. So I think E is more comprehensive.

I think E is the correct answer because it encompasses both the physical development and the behavioral changes that result from such development.

The correct answer is E: Maturation is the development of bodily processes and the changes in behavior that result from such development.

**Answer: E**
