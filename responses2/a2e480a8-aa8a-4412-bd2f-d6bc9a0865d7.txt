Okay, so I have this economics question here about how changes in the per unit price of labor affect various cost curves. I'm a bit rusty on my microeconomics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about what happens when the price of labor (which is a variable resource) increases. The options are about shifts in different cost curves. Let me think.

First, a few definitions to make sure I'm on the right track. Labor is a variable resource, meaning its quantity can be varied. Fixed resources like capital are considered constant in the short run. So, when the price of labor increases, the firm's production costs change.

I remember that the marginal product of labor (MPL) is the additional output produced by adding one more unit of labor. The marginal cost (MC) is the additional cost of producing one more unit. Since labor is variable, increasing its price would affect these costs.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Downward shift in MPL. Wait, MPL is the additional output per unit of labor. If the price of labor increases, would that affect how much output you get per unit? Or does it affect how much you can get per unit? I'm a bit confused here. I think the relation between MPL and MC is more about the relationship between the two. If the price of labor increases, it might lead to a higher MPL, but the MC curve might shift in a different way.

Option B: Downward shift in AFC. AFC is average fixed cost. Fixed costs don't change with output, so AFC is fixed cost divided by quantity. AFC doesn't depend on the price of labor, so increasing the price of labor should not affect AFC. So B is probably not correct.

Option C: Downward shift in ATC. ATC is average total cost, which includes both fixed and variable costs. If labor increases in price, variable costs go up. So ATC would increase, but whether it shifts upward or downward depends on the change. If AFC increases (which it does as output increases), but MC also increases. Wait, ATC is AFC plus AVC. If AFC increases, and if MC is higher, then ATC would also tend to increase. So maybe ATC doesn't shift downward but increases. So option C says a downward shift, which I don't think is right.

Option D: Upward shift in AVC. AVC is average variable cost. Variable costs (like labor cost) are total variable cost divided by quantity. If the price of labor increases, the total variable cost increases, so average variable cost would increase. So if the price (which is the wage) goes up, the average variable cost (AVC) would go up, causing an upward shift. So D is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. When a firm's wage rate (which is the price of labor) increases, the total variable cost increases. So for each unit of output, the variable cost per unit (AVC) increases. So yes, AVC would go up. So option D is an upward shift, which is correct. So D is correct.

Option E: Downward shift in MC. MC is the marginal cost. If the wage (price of labor) increases, the firm's cost increases. So when you produce more, the cost per unit (marginal cost) increases. So MC would shift upward, not downward. So E is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be D: An upward shift in AVC.
</think>

The correct answer is **D: An upward shift in AVC**. 

When the per unit price of labor increases, the average variable cost (AVC) rises because higher wage rates lead to higher variable costs. This causes the marginal cost (MC) to also increase, resulting in an upward shift in both AVC and MC. Other options are incorrect because they either describe shifts in the wrong curves or do not represent the effect of a higher wage rate.

D
