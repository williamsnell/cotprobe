Okay, so I've got this question about tests and their suitability for legal challenges, especially when there's adverse impact on a minority group. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that legal challenges for tests often involve things like bias, discrimination, or other issues. The question is about which test is the best choice when there's adverse impact. So, I'm thinking about what each type of test is based on.

Let me list out the options: Projective, Empirically keyed, Personality, Multiple-choice, Computer adaptive, Integrity, Work sample, Situational judgement, Cognitive ability, Polygraph.

Wait, I think Projective tests are more about assessing personality, maybe in a more indirect way. Empirically keyed tests rely on data collected from participants, so they're more controlled. Personality tests could be problematic if they're biased against certain groups.

Multiple-choice tests are straightforward, asking participants to choose between options. I've heard that these are generally considered fairer because they're less likely to be biased towards one group. But I'm not sure if they're the best when there's a known adverse impact.

Then there's the Computer Adaptive Test (CAT). CATs adjust the difficulty based on the participant's responses, which might reduce bias because the test isn't pre-biased. I think they're considered more reliable and less likely to be biased because the difficulty levels are tailored to the individual based on previous answers.

Next, the Work sample test is used in training, like in engineering. It's not really a testing method but more of an assessment. I'm not sure how relevant it is here because the question is about legal challenges for tests, not assessment methods.

The Situational judgement test is about evaluating someone's ability to make decisions in specific situations. It's more about execution than background, so maybe less likely to be biased against a specific group.

The Integrity test assesses trustworthiness in transactions, like in financial or medical settings. It's more about the person's character and their ability to uphold integrity, so unless there's a group bias in the test itself, it might not be a problem.

The Polygraph is a big one. I know it's used for questioning individuals about their beliefs and behaviors, and it's generally considered a reliable method. It's more about assessing the truthfulness of statements rather than background factors. But wait, the question is about adverse impact. If the test itself is influenced by background, that could be a problem. But the polygraph is generally considered unbiased, so it might be a good choice here.

Lastly, the Cognitive ability test measures someone's ability to process information. These are often considered less biased because they assess how well a person can think rather than their background. However, there can be issues if the test is pre-biased.

Now, the question is about which test has the best chance of withstanding a legal challenge when there's adverse impact. So, if the test is designed to measure cognitive abilities, it might not be biased. Alternatively, a fairer test like an Empirically keyed test or a Multiple-choice might be better.

But wait, the question mentions "adverse impact on some minority group has been observed." So, perhaps the test is biased against that group. In that case, we're looking for a test that's not biased against any group, or at least has less bias.

Looking at the options, the Projective test is a personality test, which might be biased. Empirically keyed tests are controlled, so less likely to have bias. Multiple-choice tests are generally fairer than personality tests. The CAT is adaptive and reduces bias.

Wait, but the question is about the type of test that's likely to withstand a legal challenge when there's adverse impact. So, which test is more likely to have low bias?

The Work sample and Situational judgement tests are more about execution, so less likely to be biased. The Integrity test is about trustworthiness, which might be affected if it's not measuring background accurately.

So, now between the options: the best would be a fairer test, possibly an Empirically keyed test or a Multiple-choice. But I think that Empirically keyed tests are more controlled because they're based on data collected, so less likely to be biased. However, if the test is biased, maybe it's not suitable.

Alternatively, a Projective test might be biased. So, if someone's test is biased against a group, it's a problem. So, which option is the best in general?

The question is about legal challenges, so the best type would be an instrument that's less likely to be biased. Computer adaptive tests (CATs) are likely the best because they adjust difficulty, reducing bias. Projective tests might be biased, and Empirically keyed tests are more controlled.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The question is about the best type when there's an adverse impact. So, the best choice would be a test that's less likely to be biased. Among the options, the CAT is adaptive and less likely to be biased because the difficulty is tailored to the examinee's responses. The Multiple-choice is also fairer than personality tests.

But I'm a bit confused because I've heard that Empirically keyed tests are more controlled and less likely to have bias, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, a fair test that's not pre-biased is better.

Wait, but in the options, the only ones that are considered fair tests are the Empirically keyed and the CAT. The CAT is a type of computer adaptive test, which is option E.

So, the answer would be E: Computer adaptive test.
</think>

The best type of test to withstand a legal challenge when adverse impact on a minority group has been observed is a **Computer Adaptive Test (CAT)**. CATs adjust the difficulty of questions based on the examinee's performance, reducing potential bias. This adaptability makes them less likely to be biased against a specific group compared to other tests like Projective or Empirically keyed tests.

Answer: E
