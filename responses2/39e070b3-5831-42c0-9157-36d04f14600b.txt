Okay, so I have this question about license plates. The question is about how many different license plates are possible. Let me try to break it down.

The license plate format is two letters followed by a four-digit number. Oh, and leading zeros are okay, so that means each digit can be anything from 0 to 9. Also, the letters and digits can be repeated, which is important.

So, I think I need to calculate the number of possible combinations for each part and then multiply them together. Because each part is independent—two letters and four digits.

Let's start with the letters. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, right? And since they can repeat, each letter position is 26 options. So for two letters, it's 26 multiplied by 26. Let me write that as 26^2.

Calculating 26 squared: 26 times 26 is 676. So the letters part gives us 676 possibilities.

Now the next part is the four-digit number. Each digit can be 0-9, so that's 10 options per digit. Since there are four digits, it's 10 multiplied by itself four times. That's 10^4.

10 to the fourth power is 10000. So the number part has 10,000 possibilities.

Now, to find the total number of license plates, I multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations. So 676 multiplied by 10,000.

Let me calculate that. 676 * 10,000. Well, 676 * 10 is 6760, so 6760 * 1000 would be 6760000. So that's 67,600,000.

Looking at the options, option A is 67,600,000. That seems to match. Let me check the other options quickly.

Option E is 67,600,000, but wait, no, that's option E. Wait, the options are:

A: 67,600,000
B: 167,600,000
C: 175,760,000
D: 6,700,000
E: 67,600,000
F: 67,600
G: 68,760,000
H: 672,000
I: 260,000
J: 67,600,000

Wait, so option A and E are both 67,600,000. Hmm, but looking back, option E is written as 67,600,000, which I think is correct. So which is the right answer? Let me think, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, no, looking again, option A is 67,600,000, E is 67,600,000 as well. Oh wait, perhaps that's a typo? Or maybe I'm mixing up the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: 67600000 (which is 67,600,000)
E: 67600000 (also 67,600,000)
But that's not possible because each option is a unique number. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck my calculation. 26 letters for each of two positions: 26^2 = 676. Four digits: 10^4 = 10000. Multiply them: 676 * 10000 = 6,760,000. Oh wait, no! Wait, 676 * 10000 is 6,760,000 and 676 * 10,000 is 6,760,000. Wait, that's 6.76 million, but my initial calculation said 67,600,000. Oh wait, no, I think I messed up the decimal places.

Wait, 26^2 is 676, correct. 10^4 is 10,000. So 676 * 10,000 is 6,760,000. So that's 6,760,000. Oh, wait, 676 * 10,000 = 6,760,000. So that's 6,760,000.

Looking at the options, option E is 67,600,000, which is 67.6 million. So that's 10 times larger. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the letters part.

Wait, wait! Oh, wait, maybe I have the letters part wrong. Because the license is two letters followed by four digits. So letters are two letters, each 26 options, so 26 * 26 = 676. So letters part is correct.

But wait, 676 * 10000 is 6,760,000. So that's 6 million 760 thousand. But looking at the options, option A is 67,600,000, which is 67 million 600 thousand. So that's 67 * 10^6, which would be 67,600,000. Which is 10 times larger than 6,760,000.

So this suggests that I made a mistake somewhere. Wait, no—maybe I should consider that the digits are four digits, so 10^4 is 10,000, which is correct. So letters 26^2 is 676, correct. 676 * 10,000 is 6,760,000.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 67,600,000 and option E is 67,600,000. Wait, that can't be because each option is unique. So perhaps the options are A:67600000 (67,600,000), and another option is 67,600, which is option F. But that's a number I don't have.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go through each step again.

Letters: 26 letters, two positions. So 26 * 26 = 676.

Digits: four digits, each 0-9, so 10^4 = 10,000.

So total combinations: 676 * 10,000 = 6,760,000.

Looking for the option that equals 6,760,000.

Looking at the options:

A: 67,600,000 → 67 million.

E: 67,600,000 → same as A.

Wait, that can't be. Maybe I have a mistake in the way the options are presented.

Wait, wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are:

A: 67,600,000

E: 67,600,000 → same number. That can't be.

Wait, no, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look at the user input again.

Wait, the user's options are:

A: 67600000

B: 16760000

C: 17576000

D: 6700000

E: 6760000

F: 67600

G: 68760000

H: 6720000

I: 260000

J: 676000

Wait, no, perhaps I got the options wrong. Wait, the user wrote:

Options:

A: 67600000

B:16760000

C:17576000

D:6700000

E:6760000

F:67600

G:68760000

H:6720000

I:260000

J:676000

Wait, so E is 67,600,000? No, E is written as 6760000, which is 6,760,000. So that can't be, because the correct answer is 6,760,000. But that's not one of the options. Wait, wait, perhaps the options are written incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the letters. Oh wait, no, two letters, 26 options each. So 26^2 = 676.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the letters part. Oh! Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the letters are two letters, so 26 * 26 is 676, correct.

Wait, but wait, the user's options are:

A: 67600000 → that's 67,600,000 (sixty-seven million six hundred thousand)

E: 6760000 → that's 6,760,000 (six million seven hundred sixty thousand)

Wait, but I calculated 676 * 10,000 = 6,760,000, which is option E. So that's correct. So the answer should be option E, which is 6,760,000 (67,600,000 is option A). Wait, but no, E is 6,760,000. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, wait, no. So the correct calculation is 26^2 * 10^4 = 676 * 10,000 = 6,760,000. So that's 6,760,000, which is option E.

Wait, so why is option A 67,600,000? Oh, because the user wrote A as 67600000, which is 67,600,000. So I think option A is 67,600,000 (correct), and E is 6,760,000 (incorrect). So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but that would imply that letters are 676, digits are 10,000. 676 *10,000 = 6,760,000. So option E is 6,760,000 and option A is 67 million 600,000. So perhaps I have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the letters part wrong. Let me think again. Two letters, each 26 options. So 26^2 = 676. That's correct.

Digits: 4 digits, each 10 options. So 10^4=10,000. Correct.

So total is 676 * 10,000 = 6,760,000. So that's 6 million 760 thousand.

Looking at the options, option A is 67,600,000 (which is 67.6 million), and option E is 6,760,000 (6.76 million). So the correct answer must be option E.

Wait, but the user provided the options as:

A: 67600000 → 67,600,000.

E: 6760000 → which is 6,760,000.

So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I thought I was right, but the initial way of thinking might have been mixed up. So the correct answer is option E. So why is there an option that is 67 million, which is option A. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I thought the letters and digits contribute.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the letters and digits are separate, but perhaps I made a mistake in the letters part. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the letters as 26^2, digits as 10^4, which is 676 * 10,000=6,760,000. So yes, that is option E.

So the answer is E:6,760,000.

The license plate format consists of two letters followed by four digits. Each letter can be any of the 26 letters in the alphabet, and each digit can be any of the 10 digits (0-9). 

1. **Letters**: There are 26 choices for each letter, so for two letters, the number of combinations is \(26 \times 26 = 26^2 = 676\).

2. **Digits**: There are 10 choices for each digit, so for four digits, the number of combinations is \(10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10^4 = 10,000\).

3. **Total Combinations**: Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations: \(676 \times 10,000 = 6,760,000\).

Looking at the options provided, the correct answer is **E: 6760000**, which corresponds to 6,760,000.
