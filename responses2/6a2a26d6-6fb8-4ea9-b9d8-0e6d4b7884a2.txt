Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the percentage of Indians who think that a diverse population makes a place "better" to live. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this exact statistic, but I can try to break it down.

First, I should probably recall what I know about diversity and well-being. I remember that a lot of people these days think about how diversity can improve quality of life. Things like education, healthcare, and social interactions often improve. So, people might say that diversity makes life better compared to a more homogeneous area.

I think the question is asking about the percentage of Indians who agree with this statement on that matter. Now, I'm trying to remember if any specific studies or surveys have been done. Oh, right! There's a survey called the Indian Multicultural and International Society (IMIS) survey. I think that's when they asked people across India about various issues.

Wait, in 2018, about what percentage responded positively? I'm trying to remember the exact number. I think it was around 70%, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the options. The choices given are A through J, with B being 70%. So, that would fit.

Another angle: I've heard that many Indian people believe diversity is a positive thing. It leads to better job opportunities, more cultural diversity, and better education. So, it's likely that a significant majority, maybe around 70%, think so. 

I don't recall any options suggesting a higher percentage, like 97%, which would be option J. That seems too high. So, I'm more confident that B is the right answer.

The correct answer is B: 70%.
