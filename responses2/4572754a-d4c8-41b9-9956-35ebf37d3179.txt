Okay, so I've got this economics multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me take it step by step. 

The question is asking which of the given statements is true. The options are A through J, each making a different claim about costs and relationships between variables. 

First, I should probably recall some basic economic principles related to cost curves. Let me think. There are various cost curves like AFC (Average Fixed Costs), AVC (Average Variable Costs), ATC (Average Total Costs), MC (Marginal Cost), and TC (Total Cost). 

I remember that the total cost (TC) is the sum of total fixed costs (TFC) and total variable costs (TVC). So, TC = TFC + TVC. Since AFC is TFC divided by the quantity (Q), AFC = TFC/Q. Similarly, AVC is TVC/Q. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: TFC = AVC at all levels of output. Wait, that can't be right. TFC is fixed, meaning it doesn't change with output. AVC, on the other hand, is variable and depends on Q. So TFC can't equal AVC at any point except maybe if TFC is zero, but that's a trivial case. So A is probably false.

Option B: AVC + AFC = TC. Let me see. If I take AFC = TFC/Q and AVC = TVC/Q, then adding them gives (TFC + TVC)/Q, which is TC/Q, but TC is price times quantity (P*Q), so this would only hold if P=1, which isn't generally true. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: TFC = TC at all levels of output. That doesn't make sense either. TC is TFC + TVC. Unless TVC is zero, which it isn't, TC will always be greater than TFC. So C is false.

Option D: MC = AVC + AFC. Oh wait, I think I remember something about this. There's a formula for marginal cost which is the derivative of TC with respect to Q. But in some textbooks, MC is often approximated as AVC plus AFC. Because MC is the change in TC when output increases by one unit. So if you have TC = TFC + TVC, then MC = d(TC)/dQ = d(TFC)/dQ + d(TVC)/dQ. Since TFC doesn't change with Q, d(TFC)/dQ is zero. So MC = TVC/Q = AVC + AFC. Yes, that makes sense. So D is true.

Option E: AFC = TC - AVC. Let me think. AFC is TFC/Q, and TC is TFC + TVC. So TC - AVC would be (TFC + TVC) - (TVC/Q). That's not the same as AFC unless TVC equals zero, which isn't the case. So E is incorrect.

Option F: ATC = TC - AFC. Since ATC is TC/Q, and AFC is TFC/Q, then TC - AFC would be (TC) - (TFC/Q) = (TFC + TVC) - (TFC/Q). That's not equal to ATC, which is (TFC + TVC)/Q. For example, if TFC is 100 and TVC is 100 when Q=1, then ATC is 200. TC - AFC would be (100 +100) - 100 = 100. So F is incorrect.

Option G: MC = TC - TFC. Wait, that's not right. Because MC is the derivative of TC, and TC - TFC is TC - TFC, but MC is d(TC)/dQ, which is equal to TVC/Q, which is AVC plus AFC. So G is incorrect.

Option H: TC = (AVC + AFC)Q. Let me see. AVC is TVC/Q, AFC is TFC/Q. So (AVC + AFC) * Q = TVC + TFC = TC. Yes, that's correct. So H is correct. Wait, but earlier I thought D was correct. Let's check this.

Wait, wait, I thought D was correct based on the MC formula, but H is also correct. Hmm, but can both be true? Or is there a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is asking which of the options is true. So both D and H might be correct, but I have to check the options.

Wait, but no, each option is a separate statement. So the correct answer is the one that is true. Let me look again.

So option D: MC = AVC + AFC is correct. Option H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q is also correct because TC is TFC + TVC, which is TFC + Q*(AVC). Since AFC is TFC/Q, then TFC = AFC*Q. So TVC = Q*(AVC). Thus, TC = AFC*Q + Q*AVC = (AVC + AFC)*Q. So H is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought D was correct. So which option is the correct answer? The question asks which is true, and there might be multiple correct statements, but the options are likely each being a claim. So perhaps both D and H are correct. But let me re-examine the question.

Wait the original options are:

D: MC = AVC + AFC.

H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q.

So both are correct? Or is there a mistake because I can't have two correct options. Let me recheck.

Wait, no. The question is asking which of the following is true, but each option is a separate statement. So each could be correct, but only one is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, let's reevaluate option D. MC is the derivative of TC with respect to Q, which is the same as (d(TFC + TVC)/dQ) = 0 + d(TVC)/dQ. So MC = TVC/Q. But TVC = Q*AVC. So TVC/Q = AVC. Also, AFC = TFC/Q. So MC = AVC + AFC. So D is correct.

Option H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q, which is TFC + TVC, which is correct. So both D and H are correct. But let me look again at the question. Wait, the question lists options from A to J, and each is a statement. So the correct options would be the true ones.

Wait, but in the problem, the options are single choices, so perhaps only one is correct. Let me see the problem again.

Wait, the question is: "Which of the following is true?" So possibly more than one could be true, but looking at the options, I think there is only one correct one.

Wait, but I thought both D and H are correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating H.

Wait, H states TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q. Let me think about that. Since AFC is TFC/Q, then (AVC + AFC) = (TVC/Q) + (TFC/Q) = (TVC + TFC)/Q = TC/Q. So (AVC + AFC) * Q = TC. So H is correct.

So both D and H are correct? But looking back, the options are given as options A to J, each as separate statements. So the question says "which of the following is true", and each option is a possible correct statement. But typically, multiple choice questions in exams have only one correct option.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me review each option again.

Option C: TFC = TC at all levels of output. No, because TC = TFC + TVC. So TC will always be larger than TFC unless TVC is zero, which isn't the case. So C is false.

Option D: MC = AVC + AFC. Correct.

Option H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q. Correct.

Wait, but the options are each single statements. So if both D and H are correct, but the problem says "which of the following is true" and the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is that both D and H are true, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.

Option D: MC = AVC + AFC.

Option H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q.

Wait, is there any other mistake? Because sometimes in economics, some formulas might have different conventions.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between MC and AFC, etc.

Wait, another way, MC is the change in total cost when you increase the quantity by one unit. So, MC = ΔTC/ΔQ.

Now, AFC is TFC/Q. So, AFC decreases as Q increases because TFC is fixed. So, as Q increases, AFC decreases, and TVC increases, so MC would be the sum of the change in TVC (which is positive, but divided by Q, which is also changing).

Wait, but I think I've already established that MC = AVC + AFC. So D is correct.

So both D and H are correct?

Wait, no. Let me look again:

Option H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q.

Which expands to TFC + QAVC, which is correct because TC = TFC + TVC, and TVC = QAVC, so yes, H is correct.

So if both D and H are correct, but the options are single choices, then perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the other options again.

Option E: AFC = TC - AVC.

No, because AFC is TFC/Q, and TC - AVC would be (TFC + TVC) - (TVC/Q). These are not equal unless TVC is zero, which isn't the case. So E is incorrect.

Option G: MC = TC - TFC.

No, because MC is the derivative, which is different from TC - TFC. So G is incorrect.

Option F: ATC = TC - AFC.

ATC is (TFC + TVC)/Q. TC - AFC is (TFC + TVC) - (TFC/Q). These are not equal because the denominator is Q. So F is incorrect.

So that leaves D and H as the correct options. But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the options are A to J, each a separate statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in option D, because I thought MC = AVC + AFC. But wait, isn't that the case only when AFC is (TFC/Q) and AVC is (TVC)/Q. So MC is d(TC)/dQ = d(TFC + TVC)/dQ = 0 + d(TVC)/dQ = d(TVC)/dQ = TVC/Q = (TVC/Q) = (TFC + TVC)/Q = (TC)/Q. So that equals AVQ + AFC, because AFC = TFC/Q. So yes, D is correct.

Thus, both D and H are correct. But in the options, each is a separate statement, and the user is presenting them as separate options. So perhaps the correct options are D and H.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice question. Let me read the problem again.

The options are:

A: TFC = AVC at all levels of output.

B: AVC + AFC = TC.

C: TFC = TC at all levels of output.

D: MC = AVC + AFC.

E: AFC = TC - AVC.

F: ATC = TC - AFC.

G: MC = TC - TFC.

H: TC = (AVC + AFC)Q.

I: TC = MC * Q.

J: AVC = TC - TFC.

So, among these, D and H are correct.

Wait, but in the problem, I'm to select the correct one. The problem says "which of the following is true?" and each option is a statement.

But sometimes, in such multiple choice questions, only one option is correct. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option H is incorrect. Let me think again.

H says TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q.

But TC = TFC + TVC.

So (AVC + AFC) * Q = (TVC/Q) + (TFC/Q) ) * Q = TVC + TFC = TC. Yes, H is correct.

So both D and H are correct. But the options don't list multiple correct answers. This is a problem.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Ah, wait a second. Let me think about the definition of MC. MC is the change in total cost when output increases by one unit. So, MC is equal to the derivative of TC with respect to Q, which is d(TC)/dQ.

TC is TFC + TVC. So d(TC)/dQ = d(TFC)/dQ + d(TVC)/dQ. Since TFC is fixed, d(TFC)/dQ is zero. So MC = d(TVC)/dQ = TVC/Q.

But TVC is Q * AVC. So TVC/Q = AVC. So MC = AVC.

Wait, that's a mistake. So if MC = TVC/Q = AVC, but according to option D, it's supposed to be MC = AVC + AFC.

But AFC is TFC/Q. So AVQ + AFC is (TFC + TVC)/Q, which is TC/Q. But MC is equal to AVC, not (AVC + AFC). So now I'm confused.

Wait, this suggests that option D is incorrect because MC is equal to AVC, not (AVC + AFC). So where was I wrong before?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me double-check.

If MC = d(TC)/dQ, and TC = TFC + TVC, then d(TC)/dQ = d(TFC)/dQ + d(TVC)/dQ. Since TFC is fixed, d(TFC)/dQ=0. So d(TC)/dQ = d(TVC)/dQ.

But TVC is TVC = Q * AVC. So d(TVC)/dQ = AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ. But d(AVC)/dQ is zero because AVC is TVC/Q, which depends on Q, but not in a way that changes with Q. Wait, no—AVC is TVC/Q. So d(AVC)/dQ is [d(TVC)/dQ * Q - TVC * 1]/Q². That's [0 * Q - TVC *1]/Q² = -TVC/Q². So putting it back: d(TVC)/dQ = AVC + Q * (-TVC/Q²) )= AVC - TVC/Q. But TVC/Q is AVC, so it's AVC - AVC = 0. So d(TC)/dQ = 0 + 0 = 0? That can't be right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach it more carefully.

Let me consider TC = TFC + TVC. TVC is Q * AVC. So TC = TFC + Q * AVC.

So d(TC)/dQ = d(TFC)/dQ + d(Q * AVC)/dQ.

d(TFC)/dQ is zero.

d(Q * AVC)/dQ can be found using product rule: d(Q)/dQ * AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ = 1 * AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ.

But what's d(AVC)/dQ? Since AVC = TVC/Q, then d(AVC)/dQ is [d(TVC)/dQ * Q - TVC * 1] / Q².

But d(TVC)/dQ is the derivative of TVC with respect to Q. TVC = Q * AVC, so d(TVC)/dQ = AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ.

Putting it together: d(AVC)/dQ = [ (AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ ) * Q - TVC ] / Q².

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's express TC as TFC + Q * AVC, since TVC = Q * AVC.

So, d(TC)/dQ = d(TFC)/dQ + d(Q * AVC)/dQ. The first term is zero (since TFC is fixed). The second term: d(Q * AVC)/dQ = AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ.

But what is d(AVC)/dQ? Let's consider that AVC is TVC/Q, so:

d(AVC)/dQ = [d(TVC)/dQ * Q - TVC * 1] / Q².

But d(TVC)/dQ is the derivative of TVC with respect to Q. Since TVC = Q * AVC, d(TVC)/dQ = AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ.

Wait, substituting back into the expression for d(AVC)/dQ:

d(AVC)/dQ = [ (AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ ) * Q - Q * AVC ] / Q².

Simplify numerator:

= [ AVC*Q + Q^2 d(AVC)/dQ - Q*AVC ] = Q^2 d(AVC)/dQ.

So, numerator is Q^2 d(AVC)/dQ.

Denominator is Q^2.

So d(AVC)/dQ = [Q^2 d(AVC)/dQ ] / Q^2 = d(AVC)/dQ.

Wait, that's a tautology, which doesn't help. Maybe it's better to approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute MC as the derivative of TC = TFC + Q*AVC. So, MC = d(TC)/dQ = d(Q*AVC)/dQ.

Which is equal to AVC + Q*d(AVC)/dQ.

But what is d(AVC)/dQ? Let's compute it:

AVC = TVC/Q.

d(AVC)/dQ = [ d(TVC)/dQ * Q - TVC * 1 ] / Q².

d(TVC)/dQ is the derivative of TVC with respect to Q. Since TVC = Q * AVC, d(TVC)/dQ = AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ.

Substituting back into the expression for d(AVC)/dQ:

d(AVC)/dQ = [ ( AVC + Q*d(AVC)/dQ ) * Q - Q*AVC ] / Q².

Simplify numerator:

= [ ( AVC * Q + Q² d(AVC)/dQ ) - Q*AVC ].

The terms cancel, leaving Q² d(AVC)/dQ.

So numerator is Q² d(AVC)/dQ, denominator is Q².

Thus, d(AVC)/dQ = d(AVC)/dQ.

Which is a tautology. So this approach doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that MC is equal to AVC because TVC is Q*AVC. So d(TC)/dQ = d(Q*AVC)/dQ = AVC + Q*d(AVC)/dQ.

But if d(AVC)/dQ is zero (since AVC is fixed?), then MC = AVC.

Wait, that would make sense. So in this case, if TVC is Q*AVC, and AVC is fixed, then d(TC)/dQ = d(Q*AVC)/dQ = AVC + Q*0 = AVC.

So in this scenario, MC equals AVC, not (AVC + AFC). So option D, which claims MC = AVC + AFC, is incorrect.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. So which is correct?

I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought that d(TC)/dQ = AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ.

But if d(AVC)/dQ is zero, because AVC is fixed, then d(TC)/dQ = AVC.

So that suggests that MC = AVC, not (AVC + AFC).

But that's different from what I thought earlier. So this would mean that option D is incorrect, and option H is correct.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the options are as given, and each is a separate statement.

So, if I've deduced that D is incorrect and H is correct, then the correct answer would be option H.

But wait, earlier I thought that H is correct because TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q.

Wait, but if (AVC + AFC) is being multiplied by Q, then TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q.

But if AFC is TFC/Q, then (AVC + AFC) = TVC/Q + TFC/Q = (TFC + TVC)/Q = TC/Q.

So (AVC + AFC) = TC/Q.

So (AVC + AFC) * Q = TC, which is correct.

But earlier, I thought that d(TC)/dQ = AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ.

If d(AVC)/dQ is zero (since AVC is fixed), then d(TC)/dQ = AVC. So MC = AVC, not (AVC + AFC).

So, that suggests that option D is incorrect, and option H is correct.

So the correct answer is option H.

But wait, what about the other options?

Option F: ATC = TC - AFC.

ATC is (TFC + TVC)/Q.

TC is (TFC + TVC).

So, (TFC + TVC) - (TFC/Q) = TFC + TVC - TFC/Q = (TFC * Q + TVC * Q - TFC ) / Q.

= (TFC * (Q - 1) + TVC * Q ) / Q.

Not equal to ATC, which is (TFC + TVC)/Q.

So option F is incorrect.

So, in this case, the correct answer is option H.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option D is correct. Now, I'm confused.

I think the confusion arises because I mixed up the formulas regarding MC and AFC.

So, to clarify:

MC is the derivative of TC with respect to Q, which is equal to AVC + Q * d(AVC)/dQ.

But if d(AVC)/dQ is zero, then MC = AVC.

So, this suggests that option D is incorrect because it states MC = AVC + AFC, which is not correct.

Instead, option H states TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q, which is correct because AFC + AVC is the marginal cost only if AFC is constant, which it's not. Wait, no—AFC is TFC/Q, and if AFC is being added to AVC, then AVC + AFC = (TVC/Q) + (TFC/Q) = (TFC + TVC)/Q = TC/Q, which is not equal to MC, which is TVC/Q.

Wait, but if AFC is being added to AVC, the sum is (TFC + TVC)/Q, which is TC/Q, which is not equal to MC.

Hmm, perhaps I should not have thought about this. Let me just go back to the options.

The problem says that which of the following is true.

The options are:

A: TFC = AVC at all levels of output.

B: AVC + AFC = TC.

C: TFC = TC at all levels of output.

D: MC = AVC + AFC.

E: AFC = TC - AVC.

F: ATC = TC - AFC.

G: MC = TC - TFC.

H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q.

I: TC = MC * Q.

J: AVC = TC - TFC.

So, the correct answer is option H, because TC is equal to (AVC + AFC) multiplied by Q. That's correct because AFC is TFC/Q, so (AVC + AFC) = (TVC/Q) + (TFC/Q) = (TFC + TVC)/Q = TC/Q. So (AVC + AFC) * Q = TC. So option H is correct.

So, the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The correct answer is **option H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q**. This is because:

1. **AFC** is defined as **TFC/Q**.
2. **AVC** is defined as **TVC/Q**.
3. Adding **AVC** and **AFC** gives **(TVC/Q) + (TFC/Q)**.
4. Combining these terms gives **(TFC + TVC)/Q = TC/Q**.
5. Multiplying both sides by **Q** gives **(TFC + TVC) = TC**.

Thus, **TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q** is correct.

ANSWER: H
