Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the ratio of items to purchase based on markup. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The store sells two items, each for $10. One costs $5.25 and the other $6.50. We need to find the ratio of how many of each item to buy so that the average markup based on the selling price is 40%. 

Hmm, average markup. I remember that markup is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So, for each item, the markup is Selling Price minus Cost Price.

Let me calculate the markup for each item. 

For the first item: Selling Price is $10, Cost is $5.25. So, markup is $10 - $5.25 = $4.75.

For the second item: Selling Price is $10, Cost is $6.50. Markup is $10 - $6.50 = $3.50.

Now, the average markup based on the selling price is 40%. I think this means that the total markup divided by the total cost equals 40%. Or wait, maybe it's the average markup per item, considering the selling price as the basis. Let me re-read the question.

"Average markup based on the selling price of 40%." So, I believe it's the average markup divided by the average selling price equals 40%. 

Wait, no. Actually, markup is based on cost, but the question says it's based on the selling price. So, the markup percentage is 40% of the selling price. So, for each item, the markup is 40% of its selling price.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: markup can be expressed in two ways. Sometimes it's based on cost (mark up percentage = (Markup/Cost)*100), and sometimes based on selling price (Markup/Selling Price *100). But in this question, the average markup is given as 40% on the selling price. So each item's markup is 40% of its selling price.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the markup is computed as (Selling Price - Cost)/Cost * 100. But the question says average markup is 40% based on the selling price. So, the markup is 40% of the selling price. So for each item, the markup is 0.4 * Selling Price.

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the average markup is 40%, which is the average of the two individual markups. Let's think again.

Wait, the average markup based on the selling price would be (Markup1 + Markup2)/2 = 40%. So, let's compute that.

Markup1 is $4.75, Markup2 is $3.50. Their average is (4.75 + 3.50)/2 = 8.25/2 = $4.125. But 4.125 is 41.25%, which is not 40%. Hmm, so maybe that approach isn't right.

Alternatively, perhaps the markup is 40% of the selling price for each item. So for each item, the markup is 0.4 * Selling Price. Let's try that.

For the first item, Markup = 0.4 * $10 = $4. So, Cost is Selling Price - Markup = $10 - $4 = $6. But wait, the given cost is $5.25, which doesn't match. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the markup is 40% of the cost. So, for the first item, markup would be 40% of $5.25, which is $2.10. So, Selling Price would be Cost + Markup = $5.25 + $2.10 = $7.35, but that doesn't match the given $10. So that also doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently.

The store sells two items, each for $10. One costs $5.25, the other $6.50. We need to find the ratio of each item's quantity such that the average markup is 40% based on the selling price.

Wait, perhaps the average markup is the total markup divided by the total cost, and that equals 40%. So, let me compute the total markup and total cost.

Total markup is $4.75 + $3.50 = $8.25. Total cost is $5.25 + $6.50 = $11.75.

So average markup is $8.25 / $11.75. Let's compute that as a percentage. 8.25 / 11.75 = approximately 0.702, which is 70.2%. That's not 40%, so that's not the approach they're expecting. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the average markup is 40% on the selling price. So, for each item, the markup is 40% of the selling price. So, for each item, Markup = 0.4 * Selling Price.

Let me try this.

For the first item: Markup = 0.4 * $10 = $4. So Cost would be Selling Price - Markup = $10 - $4 = $6. But the item costs $5.25, not $6. So that doesn't align.

For the second item: Markup = 0.4 * $10 = $4, so Cost would be $10 - $4 = $6. But the item costs $6.50, so again, doesn't fit.

So this approach isn't working. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the markup is calculated as Selling Price - Cost, and the average markup is 40% of the selling price. So, the average of (Markup1 and Markup2) is 40% of the average Selling Price.

But the average Selling Price is $10. So, 40% of $10 is $4.

So, the average markup is $4. That would mean that (Markup1 + Markup2)/2 = $4.

So, $4.75 + $3.50 = 8.25. 8.25 / 2 = $4.125. Hmm, which is 41.25%, not 40%. Close, but not exactly. So perhaps I need to adjust the quantities.

Wait, but the question says we need to find the ratio of items to purchase, so maybe they're varying the quantities of each item so that the average markup is 40% on the selling price.

Wait, perhaps the average markup as a percentage of the selling price is 40%, so each item's markup is 40% of its Selling Price. So, for each item, Markup = 0.4 * Selling Price.

But that leads to the same problem as before, since the cost would have to be Selling Price - 0.4 Selling Price = 0.6 Selling Price. But the given costs don't match that.

Wait, perhaps the markup is calculated differently. Maybe the markup is based on cost. So, markup = Selling Price - Cost, and then the markup percentage is markup / Cost * 100.

In that case, for the first item, markup is 4.75, so markup percentage is 4.75 / 5.25 * 100 ≈ 90.48%. For the second item, markup is 3.50, so markup is 3.50 /6.50 *100 ≈ 53.85%.

The average of these two markup percentages would be (90.48 +53.85)/2 = approx 72.16%. But the question specifies an average markup of 40%, so that's not matching. So perhaps I'm not approaching this correctly.

Wait, maybe the question is about the average markup as a percentage of the cost. So average markup percentage is 40% of the cost. Wait, no, the question says average markup based on the selling price. So perhaps I should stick with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the average markup is 40% of the overall selling price. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each item's markup is based on its own selling price.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should set up an equation.

Let me denote the number of item 1 as x and item 2 as y.

Each item is sold for $10.

The cost price for item 1 is $5.25, so the markup is 10 -5.25=4.75.

Similarly, for item 2, markup is 10 -6.50=3.50.

The average markup based on the selling price is 40%. So, the average markup is (4.75x +3.50y)/(x+y) = 40% of the average Selling Price.

Wait, but the average Selling Price is 10 each, so the average is 10. So, 40% of 10 is 4.

So (4.75x +3.50y)/(x + y) =4.

Multiply both sides by (x + y):

4.75x +3.50y =4(x + y)

Simplify:

4.75x +3.50y =4x +4y

Bring all terms to left side:

4.75x -4x +3.50y -4y =0

(0.75x) - (0.5y)=0.

So 0.75x=0.5 y → Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate decimals: 3x = 2y → x/y=2/3.

So the ratio is x:y=2:3.

Wait, that's option E: 2 to 3.

Wait, but the options include E as 2 to 3. So that would be the ratio of item1 to item2.

But the options are about the number of items to purchase. So, if x is the number of item1, and y is item2, the ratio is 2:3.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is 2 to 3, which matches. So the answer would be E.

Let me check.

So, if we have 2 units of item1 and 3 units of item2.

Total markup: 2*4.75 +3*3.50 =9.5 +10.5=20.

Total cost:2*5.25 +3*6.50 =10.5 +19.5=30.

Average markup:20/30=2/3 ≈0.666, which is 66.6%, but wait that's not matching the 40% given.

Wait, but earlier I assumed that the average markup is 40% of the selling price. Let me double-check that step.

The question says: "average markup based on the selling price of 40%." So, the average markup as a percentage of the selling price is 40%. So, for each item, markup is 40% of the selling price.

Wait, that can't be because then the markup would be 4.00 for the first item (40% of 10 is 4) and 4.00 for the second item (40% of 10 is 4). But the actual markup for the first item is 4.75. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the average markup is 40% of the cost, not selling price. Let me try that approach.

If the average markup is 40% of the cost, then for each item:

Markup1 =0.4 *5.25=2.10

Markup2=0.4 *6.50=2.60

Total markup:4.70.

Total cost:5.25+6.50=11.75.

Average markup=4.70/11.75 ≈0.397, which is 39.7%, close to 40% but not exact. So perhaps the question is not about cost markup but selling price markup.

Alternatively, perhaps the average markup is 40% of the average selling price.

Average selling price is 10.

So, 40% of 10 is 4.

So, total markup from both items should be 4*(x + y).

But the total markup is 4.75x +3.50y.

So, 4.75x +3.50y =4(x + y).

Which gives 0.75x=0.5 y → x/y=2/3 → 2:3.

So this matches option E, which is 2:3.

So, the answer is E: 2 to 3.
</think>

The problem requires calculating the ratio of items to purchase so that the average markup based on the selling price is 40%. 

**Step 1: Calculate Markup for Each Item**
- Item 1: Selling Price = $10, Cost = $5.25 → Markup = $10 - $5.25 = $4.75  
- Item 2: Selling Price = $10, Cost = $6.50 → Markup = $10 - $6.50 = $3.50  

**Step 2: Set Up Equation for Average Markup**
The average markup is given as 40% of the selling price. Thus, the average markup per item is $4 (40% of $10).  

**Step 3: Formulate the Equation**
Let x be the number of Item 1 and y be the number of Item 2.  
Total markup = (4.75x + 3.50y)  
Average markup = (4.75x + 3.50y) / (x + y) = 4  

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**
4.75x + 3.50y = 4(x + y)  
4.75x + 3.50y = 4x + 4y  
0.75x = 0.5y  
x/y = 2/3  

**Step 5: Determine the Ratio**
The ratio of Item 1 to Item 2 is 2:3.  

**Answer: E: 2 to 3**
