Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The scenario is a salesman who's been working for a company for 20 years. He's suddenly terminated without any apparent reason. The company sues him for age discrimination. At trial, the salesman wants to call an employee as an adverse witness. The employee is trying to testify that she was present at a company board meeting where the president made a statement. The president said, "Now, I'm sure that everyone agrees that the salesman is too old, and he really doesn't typify the image we want our employees to project."

The company has a practice of recording board meetings, and the secretary transcribes them. The question is about whether the employee's testimony is admissible.

The options are A to J, with each giving a reason why the testimony might be inadmissible or admissible.

Alright, so I remember that evidence rules are important here. Let's break this down.

First, the employee is trying to testify about her attendance at a board meeting. The key point is whether the testimony is hearsay. Hearsay is when someone else's statement is used as evidence, and it's not directly tied to the case.

The employee is trying to show that she was at the board meeting and that the president's statement relates to age discrimination. But wait, the problem is whether the statement is admissible or hearsay.

The company has a policy of recording board meetings and transcribing them. So the company's records are probably considered as official evidence. The fact that they recorded it means that the company has an official record of who was present.

The employee's testimony is about her attendance, which is based on the company's records. But if the company's records are considered as evidence, then the employee's testimony would be hearsay.

Wait, but wait. The company's tapes are considered evidence because they were recorded. So the company is saying that the board meeting was recorded, and the secretary transcribed it. So the company's record is evidence, which would include whether the employee was present.

So the employee's testimony that she was present is supported by the company's own evidence (the recorded meeting). That makes the employee's testimony not hearsay because the company's records are considered reliable and accurate.

But wait, the employee is trying to prove that the president's statement was a reason for age discrimination. The question is whether the statement itself is admissible. But the employee's testimony is about her attendance, not about the statement.

But the company's tapes are the best evidence, so the employee's testimony about being present would be supported by the company's records. Therefore, the employee's testimony is not hearsay because it's based on an official source.

Wait, but the question is whether the employee's testimony is admissible. The key here is whether the statement is hearsay. If the employee's testimony about being present is hearsay, then she can't rely on it.

The crisis is whether the statement is hearsay. Since the company's records are considered evidence (because they're official), the employee's testimony isn't hearsay. So the statement's hearsay status depends on whether it's being used to prove something that the company already established.

The employee's testimony is about her attendance. The company's records (the tapes) are reliable, so the employee can use that as evidence. Thus, the employee's testimony is not hearsay because it's based on the company's evidence.

Wait, but the company's board meetings were recorded, so the company's records are evidence, which would mean that the company's records being recorded don't make the employee's testimony hearsay. Because the company's records are the best evidence.

So, the employee's testimony is not hearsay because the company has an official record of the meeting, which is presented as evidence. Therefore, the answer shouldn't be E (inadmissible because hearsay).

Wait, but I might be mixing up the hearsay issue here. Hearsay occurs when someone uses someone else's words as evidence. So the employee's testimony about being present is hearsay unless the statement is being used for a purpose other than to prove something.

But the issue here is whether the statement is admissible as evidence. The employee's testimony is about the meeting, but the statement is about the age. So the statement is a reason for age discrimination, but the employee's testimony about the meeting is a separate issue.

But the key is whether the statement is hearsay. If the statement is used to prove the existence of age discrimination, then it's hearsay. But the company's records are evidence, so the employee's testimony about being present is supported by the company's records, making it not hearsay.

So, the employee's testimony is not hearsay because it's based on the company's evidence. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The company's tapes are the best evidence. So the employee's testimony is not hearsay because it's supported by the company's records. So the testimony should be admissible.

Looking at the options, option D says it's admissible because the president's statement is direct evidence. Is that correct?

Wait, but the direct evidence refers to the statement itself, not the testimony. The employee's testimony about the meeting is separate. The company's records are about the meeting, so the employee can rely on those records to testify.

Wait, but maybe the business rule applies. If the company's records are considered as the basis for the employee's testimony, then the testimony is not hearsay because it's supported by the company's records, which are considered reliable.

So the employee's testimony is admissible because it's supported by the company's official records. Therefore, the answer should be E: admissible because the employee's testimony is crucial to proving age discrimination.

Wait, no, wait. Because the company's records are considered evidence. So the employee's testimony is based on that.

Wait, but in this case, the employee's testimony is about the meeting, which is a separate issue. However, the company's record is about the meeting, which is used as evidence.

So the employee's testimony is not hearsay because it's based on the company's evidence. Therefore, the testimony can be admitted as evidence (not hearsay). So option E is correct.

But wait, looking back at the options, option E says the testimony is admissible because the company's record is best evidence. That makes sense.

Alternatively, option H says the testimony is admissible because the company's record supports it. So both E and H seem correct, but I need to look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

E: admissible, because company's record is best evidence.

H: admissible, because company's record supports the testimony.

So both are correct. But the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The company's records are the best evidence. The employee's testimony is about the meeting, which is supported by the company's records. So the testimony is admissible because it's supported by the company's records (which are the best evidence).

So the correct reason would be option E or H. But looking back, the options are:

E: admissible, because company's record is best evidence.

H: admissible because company's record supports the testimony.

So both E and H could be correct, but in the answer options, only one can be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue isn't whether the employee's testimony is hearsay. Let me think again.

Hearsay occurs when the statement is offered as evidence and is not directly tied to the case. The company's records are evidence, but that's about the meeting, not the statement.

The statement is a fact, but the employee is trying to show that the statement was made to support age discrimination.

Wait, but the issue is whether the statement is admissible as evidence. The company's records are the best evidence, so the evidence of the meeting is supported by the records. But the statement is about the age.

Let me think about whether the statement is hearsay. If the statement is being used to prove the existence of age discrimination, then it's hearsay. But the company's records are about the meeting, which is about the age.

Wait, perhaps the employee's testimony is about the meeting, which is a separate issue. The age is a separate issue. So if the company's records are about the meeting, which is about the age, then the employee's testimony of being present is supported by the company's records, which are the best evidence.

So the employee's testimony is admissible because the company's records support it. So the correct reason would be option H: admissible because the company's record supports the testimony.

Wait, but another angle: if the employee is trying to prove that the president's statement was a reason for age discrimination, but the company's records are about the meeting, which is different from the age issue. So the fact that the company's records are about the meeting is irrelevant to the age issue.

Wait, no. The company's board meetings are about the age of the employees, so the meeting is a part of the age-discrimination case. So the company's records are about the age-discrimination meeting. So the employee's testimony about being present is supported by the company's evidence (the company's records), so the testimony is not hearsay.

Therefore, the testimony is admissible. So the correct answer is E: admissible, because the employee's testimony is crucial to proving age discrimination.

Wait, but wait a moment. The question is whether the evidence is hearsay. If the employee's testimony is not hearsay, then the answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the employee's testimony is hearsay because the company's records are the best evidence, so the employee can't rely on them to testify. No, because the company has already recorded the meeting, making the records the best evidence. So the employee can use the company's records as evidence, which would support the testimony.

So the employee's testimony is admissible because it's supported by the company's records, which are the best evidence.

So the correct answer is E: admissible, because the company's record is best evidence.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to list the options again.

The options are:

A: admissible, because secretary's notes are best evidence.

B: inadmissible because president's statement is not relevant.

C: admissible because employee was present.

D: admissible because president's statement is direct evidence.

E: admissible because company's record supports testimony.

H: admissible because company's record supports testimony.

So the question is whether the testimony is admissible. Since the company's records are the best evidence, the employee's testimony is supported by that. So the testimony is not hearsay because it's supported by the company's records. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

But wait, another angle: is the statement itself hearsay? Because the company's records are about the meeting, which is about the age issue.

Wait, but the employee is trying to prove that the statement was made to support age discrimination. So the statement is a reason for age discrimination, but the company's records are about the age issue. So the statement is a fact against the age, not another statement.

Hmm. Let me think. The company's records are about the board meeting, which is about age discrimination. So the employee's testimony is about the meeting, which is about the age, so it's not hearsay.

Therefore, the employee's testimony is admissible because it's supported by the company's records (best evidence). So the correct answer is E.

So the correct answer should be E: admissible, because the company's record is best evidence.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the hearsay issue. The employee's testimony is about the meeting, which is a separate issue. The company's records are about the meeting, which is about the age issue. So the statement from the president is a separate fact, but the company's records are the best evidence. So the employee's testimony is not hearsay because it's supported by the best evidence.

So the correct option is E.

The question revolves around whether the employee's testimony about being present at a board meeting can be admissible. The key issues are whether the testimony is hearsay and whether the company's records support the testimony.

1. **Hearsay Issue**: The company's board meetings are recorded and transcribed. This means the company's records are considered reliable and accurate. The employee's testimony about being present at the meeting is supported by these official records, making it not hearsay. Hearsay occurs when a statement is offered for evidence and is not directly tied to the case.

2. **Best Evidence**: The company's records are the best evidence because they are official and reliable. The employee's testimony about being present at the meeting is therefore admissible as it is supported by the company's records.

3. **Relevance to Age Discrimination**: The age issue is separate from the testimony about the meeting. The company's records are about the age-discrimination meeting, so the employee's testimony about the meeting is not directly relevant to the age-discrimination claim. However, the fact that the company's records are the best evidence makes the testimony admissible.

4. **Evaluation of Options**: 
   - **A, B, C, F, J**: These options relate to hearsay or inadmissibility, which do not apply because the testimony is supported by the company's records.
   - **D**: The statement is not admissible as evidence of direct relevance to the age-discrimination claim, but it is not hearsay.
   - **E**: Correct. The testimony is admissible because the company's records support it.
   - **H**: Also correct. The testimony is admissible because the company's records support it.

Given that the company's records are the best evidence, the employee's testimony is admissible. Both options E and H are valid, but since the question asks for the most accurate reason, the best answer is E: **admissible, because the company's record is best evidence.**

ANSWER: E
