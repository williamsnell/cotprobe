Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about X-linked dominant inheritance. Hmm, I remember from my genetics class that X-linked traits are a bit different from autosomal traits because they're passed on from females, right? But wait, let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which option is a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. The options are A through J. I need to find out what makes X-linked traits unique.

First, X-linked dominant means that the gene is on the X chromosome, and it's usually transmitted from females to males. Oh wait, no, wait. I think X-linked dominant traits are usually inherited from the mother. Because females have two X chromosomes, and males have one. So if a trait is dominant, it's usually expressed when the mother passes it on to the father.

So, looking at the options. Let me go through each one:

A: Transmitted by females only to males. That doesn't sound right. I thought males pass the X to the mother. So A is probably wrong.

B: Transmitted by males only to females. No, that's the opposite. It's the mother who passes it to the father.

C: Female to female transmission. No, that's not right. Because females can pass the X to their sons, who get the Y from the mother. So C is incorrect.

D: No male to male or female to female transmission. Hmm. Wait, X-linked traits can be transmitted within males? Or can they? Wait, males have one X, so if the X is dominant, they can pass it on to their own daughters. Wait, no, if the X is the only one, then a male can't pass it to his own daughter? Because he gets the X from his mother. Wait, no, the mother's X goes to the father, not the daughter. So a male's own X can't pass to his daughter. So D says neither male to male nor female to female. But wait, can males pass the X to their own daughters? Like, if a father has the gene, can he pass it to his daughter?

Wait, no. Because the father's X goes to the mother, not the daughter. The daughter only gets the X from the mother. So a father can't pass his X to his daughter. So that would mean that males can't pass the gene to their own daughters. So D says no male to male or female to female transmission. But I'm not entirely sure.

E: Male to male transmission. I don't think that's possible. Because a male's X can't pass to his own daughters, so E is probably wrong.

F: Parental consanguinity. That's about blood relatives having a close relationship, like being cousins. I don't think this features X-linked traits. That's a general genetics concept, not specific to X-linked.

G: Male to female transmission, but not female to male. Wait, isn't that the opposite of what I know? I thought X-linked dominant is female to male. So maybe this is incorrect. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

H: Transmission only by males. No, because as I thought earlier, females can pass it to males (the sons) which can then pass it to their daughters. So H is wrong.

I: Both parents must carry the gene. That's about the concept of "parental transmission," but I don't think it's a feature of X-linked dominant. It's more about whether the gene is recessive or dominant. I remember that in heterozygous males (XY), they can pass the X to their daughters, but it's not about both parents necessarily being carriers.

J: Transmission only by females. No, that's the opposite. Females can pass it to males. So J is wrong.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The question is about a feature of X-linked dominant, so which one is correct.

X-linked traits are typically inherited from the mother. So males get the X from the mother, and if it's dominant, they display the trait. The father can't pass it to his daughter because the X comes from the mother.

Looking back at the options, which one matches this.

Option D says no male to male or female to female transmission. Wait, but females can pass the X to their sons, who get the Y from the mother. So female transmission is possible, but male to female transmission is possible. So D says no male to male or female to female. So that's incorrect because female to female transmission is possible (like if the father had the X, but no, because he'd have to get it from the mother, which he can't). Wait, no. Wait, father can't pass his X to his daughter because the daughter gets her X from the mother.

Wait, let me think again. X-linked dominant is male to female, because the father can pass the X to the daughter. Because the father has only one X, and the mother's X goes to the father, and the daughter's X comes from the mother. So the father can pass the X to the daughter, but not the mother.

So, for D: No male to male or female to female transmission. That would mean that females cannot pass the X to any male, which is correct. But can females pass the X to a female (i.e., daughter)? Yes. So D's statement that female to female transmission doesn't happen is incorrect.

Wait, so D says no male to male or female to female transmission. So if female to female is possible, then D is wrong.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about all possible options.

The X-linked dominant is typically passed from females to their sons. So females can pass the X to males (sons), so male to female is a possible transmission.

Females cannot pass the X to their own daughters because the X comes from the mother. So female to female isn't possible. So D's statement is correct: no male to male or female to female transmission. Because females can pass to sons (male to female), but can't pass to their own daughters (female to female). So D is correct.

Wait, but I thought females can pass their X to their own daughters. Let me clarify. Let's say a mother is X^D x Y (assuming D is dominant allele). Her son would receive X^D from her, and Y from his father. So the son's X is D, so he displays the trait. So the father can't pass X to his daughter. So female to female transmission is impossible.

So D says no male to male transmission (correct) and no female to female (correct), so D is correct. But wait, another way: D says no male to male or female to female. So if male to male is impossible, and female to female is impossible, then D is correct.

Wait, but I thought female can pass to male. So why is D correct?

Wait, D says no male to male or female to female transmission. So it's saying both types are impossible.

Male to male transmission is impossible because a male can't have two X chromosomes from his father. Maybe that's a separate point. Wait, no, a male can receive an X from his mother and another X from his father, but that's not X-linked. Wait, no, because a male has only one X. So he can't have another X. So male to male can't happen, I think.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me consider a male's possible transmission. A male's X can come from his mother (if he's a carrier) or from his father. But if he's male, he doesn't have a Y. So he can pass his X to his own daughter.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in terms of what each option is saying.

The question is asking which is a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance.

So, the correct feature is that females pass the X to their sons, who can then pass it to their daughters (since father's X is his, not the mother's). So, the male can pass to the daughter.

So, what is the correct statement among the options.

Looking at the options again:

D: No male to male or female to female transmission.

But wait, male to male transmission should be impossible because a male can't pass an X to another male unless they share it. But wait, a male can receive an X from his mother and another X from his father, but that's not X-linked. Wait, no, because a male only has one X. So he can't pass it to another male. Because he can't have another X. So, male to male transmission is impossible.

So D says no male to male, which is correct.

D also says no female to female transmission. Since females can pass the X to their sons (male to female), but not to their own daughters (female to female), this is correct.

So D is correct.

Wait, but another way: the statement D says no male to male (so impossible) and no female to female (also impossible). So D is correct.

Wait, but I thought female to female was possible if the father had the X. No, because the father can't pass his X to his own daughter. So D is correct.

I think I'm getting mixed up, but based on this reasoning, D is correct.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the features of X-linked dominant inheritance:

1. **X-linked dominant inheritance** is a type of genetic trait that is inherited from the **mother** and is **expressed** when the **X chromosome** is dominant. This means that females (who have two X chromosomes) are more likely to exhibit the trait compared to males (who have one X and one Y chromosome).

2. **Key transmission patterns**:
   - Females can pass the X chromosome to their **sons** (males), who can then pass it to their **daughters** (females).
   - Males cannot pass the X chromosome to another **male** because they only have one X chromosome. Thus, male-to-male transmission is impossible.
   - However, females can pass the X chromosome to their **daughters** (males), but not to their own **daughters** (females), because the X chromosome comes from the mother.

3. **Evaluating the options**:
   - **A**: "Transmitted by females only to males." Incorrect. Males can pass the X chromosome to their daughters (sons), and females can pass the X chromosome to their sons (daughters).
   - **B**: "Transmitted by males only to females." Incorrect. Females can pass the X chromosome to their sons (males), but males cannot pass the X chromosome to their own daughters.
   - **C**: "Female to female transmission." Incorrect. Females can pass the X chromosome to their sons (males), who can then pass it to their daughters (females).
   - **D**: "No male to male or female to female transmission." Correct. Male-to-male and female-to-female transmission are both impossible because males cannot pass the X chromosome to another male, and females cannot pass the X chromosome to their own daughters.
   - **E**: "Male to male transmission." Incorrect. Males cannot pass the X chromosome to another male.
   - **F**: "Parental consanguinity." Incorrect. Parental consanguinity refers to close blood relatives, not a feature of X-linked inheritance.
   - **G**: "Male to female transmission, but not female to male." Incorrect. X-linked dominant inheritance involves both male-to-female and female-to-male transmission.
   - **H**: "Transmission only by males." Incorrect. X-linked dominant inheritance involves both males and females.
   - **I**: "Both parents must carry the gene." Incorrect. This is a concept related to "parental transmission," not a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance.
   - **J**: "Transmission only by females." Incorrect. Females can pass the X chromosome to their sons (males), and males can pass the X chromosome to their daughters (females).

4. **Conclusion**: The correct answer is **D**, as it accurately describes the impossibility of male-to-male and female-to-female transmission in X-linked dominant inheritance.
