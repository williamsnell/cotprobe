Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about accounting and legal liability. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is: If a CPA recklessly departs from the standards of due care when conducting an audit, what kind of liability would the CPA be liable to third parties under the law of the question? The options are A to J, each representing different legal terms.

Hmm. The CPA is acting without due care. I remember that due care is a principle in accounting where a business must take reasonable steps to protect its clients. If a CPA doesn't follow due care and the actions are reckless, that's probably a breach of that principle.

Wait, what are the possible legal consequences for such a breach? Let's think about each option.

Option A: Unintentional tort. That's a legal liability where the action is intentional and causes harm. But here, the CPA is reckless, not intentional. So probably not A.

Option B: Gross negligence. I think this refers to a situation where a party is negligent without intent. Like a negligent misrepresentation. If the CPA didn't do anything wrong, but the actions were reckless, maybe not gross negligence.

Option C: Fraud. Fraud is when someone misuses their professional knowledge to make false claims. If the CPA is acting without due care, that's more about negligence rather than lying. So I don't think C is correct.

Option D: Breach of contract. That's when a party fails to perform a contract, like failing to deliver something. The CPA is acting without care, but I don't see the direct connection. Unless the acts are considered obligations, but I'm not sure. Maybe not D.

Option E: Breach of warranty. This is when a product is defective and the manufacturer fails to fix it. Here, it's about CPA actions without care, which doesn't directly relate to manufacturing defects. So probably not E.

Option F: Negligence. Oh, wait! Negligence is when a person commits a duty to another and fails to perform it with reasonable care. The CPA's reckless behavior would be a breach of their duty to due care, leading to negligence. So F seems correct.

Option G: Misrepresentation. That's when someone falsely represents something, which can lead to liability. But again, the CPA isn't lying; they're being reckless. So maybe G isn't the right term.

Option H: Constructive fraud. That's when someone makes a false statement with the intent to cause harm. The CPA is acting without care, but their actions are not fraudulent. So H is not correct.

Option I: Professional malpractice. That's a term used when a professional fails to meet their obligations because of professional negligence. The CPA's reckless actions would be a form of professional negligence, leading to malpractice liability. So I is a possibility.

Option J: Strict liability. This is a concept where certain crimes are so severe that even without malice, the parties are strictly liable. Like strict liability in tort law. But I'm not sure if due care is a factor here. I think strict liability typically applies when the harm is so severe that it would have been impossible to avoid, regardless of negligence.

So now I'm a bit confused. Both F and I seem plausible. The question is about a CPA departing from due care. So what's the legal term for that?

Wait, in tort law, gross negligence is a form of negligence where the party is negligent to the extent of their reasonable care. If a CPA is acting with reckless disregard, that's a breach of their duty. So the CPA is negligent, leading to a tort liability. But the options don't include gross negligence as the first choice, but F is negligence, which is correct.

So the CPAs' actions are negligent, leading to their liability. So the answer should be F: Negligence.

Alternatively, is there a possibility that it's professional malpractice? Because professional negligence is about failing to meet obligations due to care. So if the CPA's conduct is due care, then they wouldn't be liable as malpracticed. But if they are reckless, then they are. So the question is about reckless departure from standards, which would be negligence.

Wait, no, professional malpractice is when a professional fails to fulfill their duty due to negligence. So if CPAs are acting negligently, they might be liable as malpracticed, but if they're negligent, they're liable as negligent. But in this case, the CPA is reckless, which is a higher standard of negligence.

So the correct term is F: Negligence because it's a breach of their duty to due care, leading to liability.

Wait, but the options include F: Negligence and I: Professional malpractice. Which is correct?

I think the correct term would be F: Negligence. Because the CPA's conduct is negligent, the actions are negligent, leading to their liability.

So the answer is F.

The CPA's reckless departure from due care, leading to negligence, results in liability under negligence, making the correct answer F: Negligence.

Answer: F
