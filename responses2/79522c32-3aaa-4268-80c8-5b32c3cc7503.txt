Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about machine learning concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2. Then, there are options A through J, each giving a combination of True or False for these statements. I need to figure out whether each statement is true or false, then match it to the correct option.

Starting with Statement 1: "L2 regularization of linear models tends to make models more sparse than L1 regularization." Hmm. I remember that regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function. There are two common types: L1 and L2 regularization.

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso, uses the absolute value of the weights. This can lead to sparse models because it tends to drive some coefficients to zero. So, L1 tends to create a model where only a few features are important because the others are effectively removed from the model.

On the other hand, L2 regularization, which uses the square of the weights, tends to spread the weights more evenly across all features. It doesn't set coefficients to zero, so the model doesn't become as sparse. Instead, it keeps all the features but reduces their magnitude. So, for Statement 1, it's saying that L2 makes the model more sparse than L1. But wait, isn't L2 making it less sparse? So Statement 1 is False because L2 doesn't make the model more sparse than L1; in fact, L1 does that.

Moving on to Statement 2: "Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers." I'm pretty sure that ResNets do use residual connections. I think they were introduced by He et al. in 2015. As for Transformers, I recall that they also use residual connections. The original Transformer paper introduced them, and many variants like GPTs have added residual connections. So both ResNets and Transformers use residual connections. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.

Now, putting it together. Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is True. So looking at the options: 

Option A: False, Mostly False. Wait, the second part is True, so A is incorrect.
Option B: False, True. That matches what I've deduced.
Option C: Mostly True, True. Both statements are True, so no.
Option D: False, False. No, because Statement 2 is True.
Option E: True, False. No, because Statement 1 is False.
Option F: Mostly False, Mostly False. No, because Statement 2 is True.
Option G: Mostly True, False. No, same as before.
Option H: True, True. No, Statement 1 is False.
Option I: True, Mostly True. No, Statement 1 is False.
Option J: Mostly False, True. Yes, that matches what I have.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Statement 1: L2 tends to make models sparser than L1. But L1 actually makes them sparse. So Statement 1 is False. Statement 2: Residual connections are found in ResNets and Transformers. Both do, so True. So the pair is False, True. Looking at the options, that's option B: False, True.

Wait, but looking back at the options provided, option B is "False, Mostly False" â€” no, no, no. Wait, no, let's look again.

Wait, the options are:

A: False, Mostly False
B: False, True
C: Mostly True, True
D: False, False
E: True, False
F: Mostly False, Mostly False
G: Mostly True, False
H: True, True
I: True, Mostly True
J: Mostly False, True

Ah, I see. So option B is False, True. That matches what I concluded. So the correct answer should be option B.

The analysis determined that Statement 1 is False because L2 regularization does not make models more sparse than L1 regularization; L1 does. Statement 2 is True as both ResNets and Transformers use residual connections. Thus, the correct option is B: False, True.

Answer: B
