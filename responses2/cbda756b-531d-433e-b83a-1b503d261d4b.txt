Okay, so I have this matrix here, and I need to find its determinant. Let me see... The matrix is A = [[2, 4, 3], [3, 3, 1], [42, 20, 51]]. Hmm, determinants can be a bit tricky, especially for a 3x3 matrix. I remember there's a formula for that. Let me recall it. Oh right, it's something like expanding along a row or column using the rule of Sarrus or maybe the cofactor expansion.

Wait, which method is better? For a 3x3, the cofactor expansion might be straightforward. So I'll go with that. The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:

det(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a, b, c]
[d, e, f]
[g, h, i]

So applying that to our matrix, let's label the elements:

a = 2, b =4, c=3
d=3, e=3, f=1
g=42, h=20, i=51

So plugging into the formula:

det(A) = 2*(3*51 - 1*20) -4*(3*51 - 1*42) +3*(3*20 -3*42)

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First term: 2*(3*51 - 1*20)
3*51 is 153, 1*20 is 20. Subtracting gives 153-20=133. Multiply by 2: 266.

Second term: -4*(3*51 - 1*42)
3*51 is 153, 1*42 is 42. Subtracting gives 153-42=111. Multiply by -4: -444.

Third term: 3*(3*20 -3*42)
3*20 is 60, 3*42 is 126. Subtracting gives 60-126= -66. Multiply by 3: -198.

Now, add all three terms together: 266 -444 -198.

Let me calculate that. 266 minus 444 is -178. Then, -178 minus 198 is -376. So the determinant is -376. Looking back at the options, option H is -376. So the answer should be H.

The determinant of matrix A is calculated using the formula for a 3x3 matrix. After performing the calculations, the determinant is found to be -376.

Answer: H: -376
