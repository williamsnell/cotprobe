Okay, let's tackle this music showcase problem. So, the question gives the schedule for a showcase with 3 sets and 1 long set, each with different durations. Plus, there are breaks between each set. My task is to find the total length of the showcase.

First, let me break down the components. There are three 20-minute sets and one 40-minute set. That's 3 times 20 plus 40. So 3×20 is 60, plus 40 makes 100 minutes before adding the breaks.

Then, there are breaks. The problem says there's a 10-minute break between each set. Now, how many breaks are there? Well, between each of the 4 sets, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the sets themselves are 3 sets of 20 and 1 set of 40, so that's 4 sets in total. So between each set, there's a break. So how many breaks? Between set 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4. So that's 3 breaks. Each 10 minutes, so 3×10=30 minutes.

So putting it together, the total time is the sum of the sets plus the breaks. So 100 minutes for the sets plus 30 minutes for the breaks. 100+30=130 minutes.

Looking at the options, option J is 130 minutes. So the answer should be J.

The total length of the music showcase is calculated by adding the durations of all sets and the breaks between them. 

- **Sets**: 3 × 20 minutes + 1 × 40 minutes = 60 + 40 = 100 minutes.
- **Breaks**: There are 3 breaks of 10 minutes each, totaling 30 minutes.
- **Total**: 100 + 30 = 130 minutes.

Answer: J: 130 minutes
