Okay, so I need to find the mean weight of a sample of rats. The weights given are 2 lbs, 3 lbs, 6 lbs, 8 lbs, and 9 lbs. Hmm, let me think about how to calculate the mean.

Wait, mean is the average, right? So I should add up all the weights and then divide by the number of rats. Let me list them again: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9. 

Adding those up: 2 plus 3 is 5. Then 5 plus 6 is 11. 11 plus 8 is 19, and 19 plus 9 makes 28. So the total weight is 28 lbs.

Now, how many rats are there? Let me count: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9â€”that's five rats. So I divide the total by 5. 28 divided by 5 equals... let me calculate. 5 times 5 is 25, so 28 minus 25 is 3. So that's 5.6. Wait, 5 and 3/5, which is 0.6. So 5.6 lbs total.

Looking at the options, option F is 5.6 lbs. So that's the answer. I think that's correct.

To find the mean weight, sum the weights and divide by the number of rats.

Mean = (2 + 3 + 6 + 8 + 9) / 5 = 28 / 5 = 5.6 lbs.

The correct answer is F: 5.6 lbs.
