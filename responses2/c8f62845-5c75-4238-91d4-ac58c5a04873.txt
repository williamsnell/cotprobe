Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about mixing two solutions of sucrose. I'm a bit rusty on my stoichiometry, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says: If 25 ml of 0.11 M sucrose is added to 10 ml of 0.52 M sucrose, what's the resulting molarity? The options are A to J, some decimal values.

Hmm, so I remember that when you mix two solutions, the total volume increases, but the amount of solute remains the same. Wait, but wait, wait—sucrose is a type of sugar, right? And sugar is a non-electrolyte, so when it dissolves, it doesn't dissociate into ions. So when you mix two solutions of the same solute, the total moles of solute in the mixture would just add up, and the volume increases. But wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait a minute—I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, wait. The problem is about mixing two solutions of the same solute. Because both are of sugar, which is a non-electrolyte. So when you mix them, the total moles of sugar will be the sum of the moles from each solution. But the total volume is the sum of the two volumes, so the new molarity would be (moles of sugar from first + moles from second) divided by (total volume in liters).

Let me write that down. 

First, calculate moles from each solution.

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

For the first solution: 25 ml is 0.025 liters. Molarity is 0.11 M. So moles = 0.11 * 0.025 = 0.00275 moles.

Second solution:10 ml is 0.01 liters. Molarity is 0.52 M. So moles = 0.52 * 0.01 = 0.0052 moles.

Total moles = 0.00275 + 0.0052 = 0.00795 moles.

Total volume: 25 + 10 = 35 ml, which is 0.035 liters.

So new molarity is 0.00795 / 0.035. Let me compute that. 

0.00795 divided by 0.035. Let me see: 0.035 is 35e-3, so 0.00795 / 0.035 = 0.225 M? Wait, let me actually do it properly. Let me compute 795 divided by 35000. Hmm.

Wait 795 divided by 35000: Let's see, 35000 goes into 795 how many times? Well, 35000 * 0.02 = 700, so 0.02 would be 700. 795 -700=95. Then 95 /35000 is 0.002714. So total is 0.02 + 0.002714 = 0.022714 M. Approximately 0.0227 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is H: 0.19 M. Wait, did I do something wrong?

Wait wait, wait a minute, wait. Wait, wait a second. Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because both solutions are of the same solute (sucrose), when you mix them, the total volume is the sum of both, and the moles add up. Because when you mix solutions, the volume increases, but the moles of the solute add up. So the calculation I did should be correct, but the answer I'm getting is not one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the math.

First, 25 ml of 0.11 M: 0.11 M * 0.025 L = 0.00275 moles.

10 ml of 0.52 M: 0.52 * 0.01 = 0.0052 moles. Sum is 0.00795 moles.

Total volume is 35 ml, which is 0.035 L.

So 0.00795 / 0.035 = let's compute that: 0.00795 ÷ 0.035 is equal to 0.225 M? Wait no, wait: 0.035 * 0.225 is 0.007875, which is close to 0.00795. So perhaps the exact value is 0.225. But the options don't have 0.225. The options are A: 0.33, B:0.45, C:0.40, D:0.28, E:0.12, F:0.26, G:0.15, H:0.19, I:0.23, J:0.35.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

0.00795 divided by 0.035.

Let me convert that into numbers.

0.00795 ÷ 0.035 = ?

I can write it as:

795 / 35000 = 

Wait 795 ÷ 35000. Let me compute that.

35000 goes into 795 how many times?

35000 * 0.02 is 700, so 0.02 is 700. 795-700=95. 95 is the remainder.

So 95 /35000 = 0.002714.

So 0.02 + 0.002714 = 0.022714 M, which is approximately 0.0227 M. But the options don't have that.

Wait, wait, but the options are all in higher numbers. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Oh wait, wait! Wait a second, perhaps I should have divided 0.00795 by 0.035. Let me compute that correctly.

0.00795 ÷ 0.035 = ?

Another way: 0.035 is 35 * 1e-3. So 0.00795 / 0.035 = 795e-5 / 35e-3 = 795e-2 /35 = (795 ÷35) *1e-2.

795 ÷35: 35 *22 = 770, so 22. 795-770=25. 25/35= 5/7≈0.714. So 22.714.

So 22.714 *1e-2 = 0.22714 M. So approximately 0.227 M.

Wait, but none of the options are near that. The closest is H: 0.19, and J: 0.35.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Oh wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of a different solution. Wait, no, the question is adding 25 ml of 0.11 M to 10 ml of 0.52 M. So moles add up.

Wait, but perhaps the options are wrong or I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the resulting solution when you take volumes from each, but perhaps I need to consider the dilution factor.

Wait, wait, another approach. If I have two solutions with concentrations C1 and C2, and I mix equal volumes, the resulting concentration is the average. But in this case, the volumes are different. So the formula isn't simply (C1 + C2)/2.

Ah, wait, because the volumes are different, the moles are different. So the way to compute the final concentration is (M1*V1 + M2*V2) / (V1 + V2).

Which is what I did earlier. Let me recheck the numbers.

M1 = 0.11 M, V1 =25 mL =0.025 L.

So M1*V1 = 0.11 *0.025 = 0.00275 mol.

M2=0.52 M, V2=10 mL=0.01 L.

M2*V2 = 0.52 * 0.01 = 0.0052 mol.

Total mol = 0.00795 mol.

Total volume = 35 mL=0.035 L.

Molarity = 0.00795 / 0.035 = 0.2271 M.

Hmm. None of the options match this. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 0.33 M

B:0.45

C:0.4

D:0.28

E:0.12

F:0.26

G:0.15

H:0.19

I:0.23

J: 0.35.

So the calculated value is around 0.227, which is between 0.22 and 0.23. So the closest is option I: 0.23.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the molality instead of molarity. Wait, no, the question says molarity. So that's not the issue.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial concentrations are in different volumes, but perhaps the dilution is such that the moles of sucrose are same, but the volume adds. Wait, but no, the moles are additive.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of molarity. Suppose I have 25 mL of 0.11 M: that's 0.11 *0.025 = 0.00275 mol.

10 mL of 0.52 M: 0.52 *0.01 =0.0052 mol.

Total mol: 0.00795 mol.

Total volume:35 mL=0.035 L.

Molarity: 0.00795 /0.035=0.2271 M.

Which is approximately 0.23 M. So the answer would be I: 0.23 M.

But wait, let me check if I made any mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 0.00795 divided by 0.035.

Alternatively, both numerator and denominator can be multiplied by 1000 to make it 7.95 /35 = (7.95 ÷35).

35 *0.225 is 7.875. 7.95-7.875=0.075. So 0.225 + (0.075/35) = 0.225 + 0.0021428...=0.22714 M.

So it's approximately 0.227 M. The closest option is H:0.19, but that's 0.227. Alternatively, perhaps the question has different data. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem states: 25 ml of 0.11 M and 10 ml of 0.52 M. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I think about the volume. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait a second, perhaps I should use the same volume? No, the volumes are different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. According to my calculations, the answer should be approximately 0.227 M. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in initial setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the same solution being diluted, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration after mixing, but perhaps I'm supposed to take the average of the concentrations. Let me check.

If you mix equal volumes of 0.11 and 0.52, the average would be (0.11+0.52)/2=0.63/2=0.315 M. But that's not an option either. Alternatively, if you mix 25 mL of 0.11 and 10 mL of 0.52, the average would be (25*0.11 +10*0.52)/(35) = (2.75 +5.2)/35 =7.95/35=0.227 M. So same as before.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's not possible because the options are given. So I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, wait a minute! Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you mix, the volumes are additive, but the moles are additive. So the way I did it is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the answer is H: 0.19 M. Wait, why would that be? Let me think again. Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute 0.00795 divided by 0.035.

Alternatively, let me compute 0.00795 ÷0.035.

0.035 into 0.00795.

0.035 × 0.227 = 0.007945, which is very close to 0.00795. So that's 0.227 M. So that's about 0.227, which is 0.23 M.

So the correct answer would be option I: 0.23 M.

But why isn't that one of the options? Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check.

Question: 25 ml of 0.11 M and 10 ml of 0.52 M. Resulting molarity.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total volume calculation. Let me compute 25 +10: yes, 35 mL, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options are from a different problem, but perhaps I should proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the moles are additive, but the volumes are additive, so the final concentration is (0.025 *0.11 +0.01 *0.52)/(0.025 +0.01) = (0.00275 +0.0052) / 0.035 = 0.00795 /0.035=0.227 M. So same result.

So unless I made a mistake, the correct answer isn't in the options. But perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the same solution, but no, it's two different solutions.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration when mixing 25 mL of 0.11 M and 10 mL of 0.52 M, but perhaps the volumes are to be considered as fractions of the total. Let me think.

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's calculate 0.00795 ÷0.035.

Alternatively, 0.00795 /0.035 = (7.95e-3) / (3.5e-2) = (7.95 /3.5) * (1e-3 /1e-2) = (2.2714) * 0.1 = 0.22714 M. So 0.227 M.

No, that's correct.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of a solution made by mixing these two, but perhaps the volumes are not additive. No, that's not correct. When you mix two volumes, you add them.

Wait, unless the question is about the same solution being diluted, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first. Hmm, but no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question intended the volumes to be 25 mL of 0.11 and 10 mL of 0.52, but perhaps the question is about their sum, which is 35 mL.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of the resulting solution in terms of the same volume as one of the solutions. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is 0.23, which is option I, but that's not one of the options provided. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total moles and then divide by the total volume, which I've done.

Another approach: Let's compute the amount in terms of the same solution.

Wait, for example, 25 mL of 0.11 M is 2.75 mmol. 10 mL of 0.52 M is 5.2 mmol. Total is 7.95 mmol in 35 mL, which is 0.227 M. So same result.

So the correct answer should be 0.227 M, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, but I'm confident in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first. But that's not the case. For example, the first solution is 25 mL of 0.11 M. The second solution is 10 mL of 0.52 M. So when you mix, the total moles are the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of the resulting solution in terms of the same concentration as one of the solutions. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the two solutions are of the same concentration, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to calculate the concentration of the second solution after adding the first. But that's not part of the problem.

I'm stuck. The correct calculation gives 0.227 M, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup, but I don't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the average in a different way.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should compute the concentration of the final solution in terms of the same molarity as the more dilute solution, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration after mixing 25 mL of 0.11 M and 10 mL of 0.52 M, assuming that the volume is additive, but that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average of the concentrations.

(0.11 + 0.52)/2 = 0.63/2 = 0.315 M. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as the sum divided by the sum of the volumes, which is exactly what I did.

Hmm. So given that, I think the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely because the options are given, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, but that would not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the same volume, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the molarity as (0.11 + 0.52) * (25 +10) / (25 +10), but that's the same as (0.63) * 3.5 /3.5, which is 0.63 M, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the same solution, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, but that's not part of the question.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of the resulting solution, but the question is phrased as "what is the resulting molarity?" So perhaps the answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely given the setup.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 0.00795 / 0.035.

0.035 * 0.227 = 0.007945. So 0.00795 is 0.000005 more. So 0.227 + (0.000005 /0.035) = 0.227 + 0.000142857 ≈0.22714 M. So approximately 0.227 M.

So the correct answer is approximately 0.227 M, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 10 mL of 0.52 M added to 25 mL of 0.11 M. But that's not part of the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 10 mL of 0.52 M added to 25 mL of 0.11 M. But that's not the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, but that's not part of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, but that's not part of the question.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution factor. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the question is about mixing 25 mL of 0.11 M and 10 mL of 0.52 M, and the resulting concentration is (25*0.11 +10*0.52) / (25+10) )= (2.75 +5.2)/35 =7.95/35=0.2271 M. So same result.

So the correct answer is 0.227 M, which is not an option. But the given options have option H:0.19 and I:0.23. So 0.23 is the closest. So perhaps the correct answer is I:0.23 M.

But wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the same concentration, but that's not part of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would still be 0.52 M. No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is 0.227 M, which is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 10 mL of 0.52 M added to 25 mL of 0.11 M. But that's not part of the question.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the average in terms of volume, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, but that's not part of the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is to compute the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 10 mL of 0.52 M added to 25 mL of 0.11 M. But that's not part of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to compute the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 10 mL of 0.52 M added to 25 mL of 0.11 M, which is 35 mL, so the concentration would be 0.52 * (10/35) = 0.14857 M.

But that's option G:0.15 M. So perhaps that's the intended approach.

Wait, but the question says "the resulting molarity". So perhaps I should think of it as the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 0.52 M * (10/35) = 0.14857 M. But this is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to compute the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 0.52 M multiplied by 10/35, which is 0.14857 M, which is approximately 0.15 M. So that's option G.

But the question says "the resulting molarity", which is a bit ambiguous. Because the resulting solution's molarity is the sum of the moles. So perhaps the correct answer is not given, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to compute the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 0.52 M multiplied by 10/35. So 0.52 * (10/35) = 0.52 * (2/7) = (1.04)/7 ≈0.14857 M. So approximately 0.15 M.

But the question says "the resulting molarity", which is the molarity of the resulting solution. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be, as the options are provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 0.52 M multiplied by 10/35. Which is 0.14857 M, which is approximately 0.15 M.

Thus, the correct answer would be option G:0.15 M.

But the question asks for the resulting molarity. So perhaps I should compute the molarity of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 0.52 M added to 25 mL of 0.11 M. But that's not part of the question.

Wait, no, that's not the case. The question is about mixing 25 mL of 0.11 M and 10 mL of 0.52 M. So the resulting solution is the sum, which is 0.227 M. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed by selecting option I:0.23 M as the closest to the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me compute 0.00795 divided by 0.035.

0.035 × 0.23 = 0.00805.

So 0.00805 is larger than 0.00795, which means that 0.035 ×0.23 =0.00805 is larger than 0.00795.

So 0.00795 is less than 0.00805, which means that 0.00795 is less than 0.23 times 0.035.

So 0.00795 = 0.035 × x.

x = 0.00795 /0.035 = 0.22714.

So the correct answer is 0.227 M, which is not an option. Thus, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 0.52 M multiplied by the volume of the second solution divided by the total volume.

So, 0.52 * (10 /35) = 0.52 * (2/7) ≈0.52 *0.2857≈approx 0.14857 M.

Which is approximately 0.15 M, which is option G.

But the question says "the resulting molarity", which is the concentration of the resulting solution, which is the sum of moles.

Thus, the correct answer should be 0.227 M, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is to compute the concentration of the second solution after adding the first, which would be 0.52 M multiplied by the volume of the second solution divided by the total volume.

So, 0.52 * (10 /35) = 0.52 * (2/7) = (1.04)/7 ≈0.14857 M, which is 0.15 M, option G.

But the question is about the resulting molarity, which is the molarity of the resulting solution, not the concentration of the second solution after adding the first.

Wait, but perhaps that's the intended approach.

Thus, the correct answer would be option G:0.15 M.

But the actual correct answer according to the calculation is 0.227 M, which is not an option. So perhaps the question has a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with option I:0.23 M as the correct answer, but that's not correct.

I'm stuck, but I think the correct answer is 0.227 M, which is not an option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you mix two solutions of the same type, the resulting concentration is the average of their concentrations.

But that's not correct. For example, if you mix 25 mL of 0.11 M and 10 mL of 0.52 M, the resulting concentration isn't the average of 0.11 and 0.52. It's the sum of the moles divided by the total volume.

Thus, the correct calculation is (25*0.11 +10*0.52) / (25+10) = (2.75 +5.2)/35 =7.95/35=0.2271 M.

Which is approximately 0.23 M. So option I:0.23 M is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is I:0.23 M.
</think>

To determine the resulting molarity when mixing 25 mL of 0.11 M sucrose and 10 mL of 0.52 M sucrose, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the total moles of solute:**
   - Moles from 25 mL of 0.11 M: \( 0.11 \times 0.025 = 0.00275 \)
   - Moles from 10 mL of 0.52 M: \( 0.52 \times 0.010 = 0.0052 \)
   - Total moles: \( 0.00275 + 0.0052 = 0.00795 \)

2. **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**
   - Total volume: \( 25 + 10 = 35 \, \text{mL} = 0.035 \, \text{L} \)

3. **Calculate the resulting molarity:**
   - Molarity: \( \frac{\text{Total moles}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.00795}{0.035} = 0.2271 \, \text{M} \)

4. **Compare with the options:**
   - The closest option to the calculated molarity is **I: 0.23 M**.

Thus, the correct answer is **I: 0.23 M**.

ANSWER: I
