Okay, so I have this problem about salt in a tank, and I need to figure out how much salt is left after some time. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: There's a tank with 100 gallons of fresh water. Then, water with 1/2 lb of salt per gallon is being poured in at 2 gallons per minute. The mixture leaves at the same rate. After 10 minutes, the process stops, and then fresh water is added at 2 gallons per minute, with the mixture leaving again at the same rate. I need to find the amount of salt in the tank after another 10 minutes.

Hmm, this sounds like a mixing problem involving concentrations. I remember that these usually involve differential equations, but maybe I can model it without getting into calculus by using the principles of conservation of mass.

Let me think: Initially, the tank has 100 gallons of fresh water, so the initial amount of salt is 0 lb. The inflow is 2 gal/min with 0.5 lb/gal of salt, so the salt inflow rate is 2 * 0.5 = 1 lb/min. The outflow is the same rate, so the outflow of salt should be calculated based on the concentration in the tank at any time.

Wait, but since the volume is constant? Because the inflow and outflow rates are both 2 gal/min. So the total volume remains 100 gallons. Oh, that's important because if the volume were changing, the concentration would vary over time. But here, since the inflow equals outflow, the volume stays the same.

So the concentration at any time t (before the second phase) is salt amount divided by 100 gallons. Let's denote S(t) as the amount of salt in the tank at time t.

In the first phase (t from 0 to 10 min), the rate of change of salt S(t) is the inflow minus outflow. So dS/dt = (inflow rate of salt) - (outflow rate of salt).

Wait, the inflow is 1 lb/min, right? Because 2gal/min * 0.5 lb/gal = 1 lb/min.

The outflow is the concentration at that time multiplied by the outflow rate. Since the volume is 100, the concentration is S(t)/100. So the outflow is (S(t)/100) * 2 gal/min = (2/100) S(t) = 0.02 S(t) lb/min.

So the differential equation is dS/dt = 1 - 0.02 S. That's a linear ODE, and I can solve it using an integrating factor.

The integrating factor is e^(∫0.02 dt) = e^(0.02 t). Multiply both sides by this factor:

e^(0.02 t) dS/dt + 0.02 e^(0.02 t) S = e^(0.02 t) * 1.

The left side is the derivative of (S(t) * e^(0.02 t)) with respect to t. So integrate both sides:

∫ d/dt (S(t) e^{0.02t}) dt = ∫ e^{0.02t} dt

So S(t) e^{0.02t} = (1/0.02) e^{0.02t} + C.

Wait, 1/(0.02) is 50. So,

S(t) e^{0.02t} = 50 e^{0.02t} + C.

Divide both sides by e^{0.02t}:

S(t) = 50 + C e^{-0.02 t}.

Now, initial condition: At t=0, S(0)=0. So,

0 = 50 + C => C = -50.

So S(t) = 50 (1 - e^{-0.02 t}).

That's the amount of salt in the tank after the first 10 minutes. Plugging t=10:

S(10) = 50 (1 - e^{-0.2} ).

Calculate e^{-0.2}: approximately 0.8187. So 1 - 0.8187 ≈ 0.1813. Multiply by 50: 50 * 0.1813 ≈ 9.065 lb.

Wait, so after the first phase (10 min), the tank has about 9.065 lb of salt.

Now, after that, fresh water is added at 2 gal/min, so the mixture is leaving at 2 gal/min. But the inflow is now 2 gal/min fresh water, so the volume remains 100 gallons. Therefore, the concentration is S(t)/100.

So in the second phase, the rate of salt entering is 0 lb/min (because it's fresh water). The rate of salt leaving is (S(t)/100) * 2 = (2 S(t))/100 = 0.02 S(t) lb/min.

So dS/dt = 0 - 0.02 S(t) = -0.02 S(t).

Wait, that's the same differential equation as before but with initial condition S(0) = 9.065 lb.

This is an exponential decay. The solution is S(t) = S0 e^{-kt}, where k=0.02.

So S(t) = 9.065 e^{-0.02 t}.

Now, we're looking for S after another 10 minutes, so t = 10.

Thus, S(10) = 9.065 e^{-0.2}.

We calculated e^{-0.2} ≈0.8187. So 9.065 * 0.8187 ≈?

Let me compute that: 9 * 0.8187 is about 7.3683, and 0.065 * 0.8187 ≈ 0.0531. So total ≈7.3683 + 0.0531 = 7.4214 lb.

Wait, that's approximately 7.42 lb. Looking at the options, option B is 7.42 lb.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial phase. Let me re-calculate the first phase.

Wait, in the first phase, the volume is 100 gal. The inflow is 2 gal/min at 0.5 lb/gal, so 1 lb/min in. The outflow is 2 gal/min at concentration S(t)/100, so 2*(S(t)/100) = 0.02 S(t) lb/min out.

So dS/dt = 1 -0.02 S(t). Initial S(0)=0.

Solution: S(t) = (1/0.02)(1 - e^{-0.02 t})? Wait, no, the general solution is S(t) = (1/0.02) (1 - e^{-0.02 t}) ) * C. Wait, let me re-derive.

The equation is dS/dt + 0.02 S = 1.

The integrating factor is e^{0.02 t}.

Multiply both sides:

e^{0.02 t} dS/dt + 0.02 e^{0.02 t} S = e^{0.02 t}.

Left side is d/dt (S e^{0.02t}) = e^{0.02t}.

Integrate both sides:

S e^{0.02t} = ∫ e^{0.02t} dt = (1/0.02) e^{0.02t} + C.

So S(t) = (1/0.02) + C e^{-0.02t}.

But applying initial condition S(0)=0:

0 = (1/0.02) + C => C = -50.

Thus, S(t)=50 (1 - e^{-0.02 t}).

At t=10, e^{-0.2}=~0.8187. So 50*(0.1813)=9.065 lb.

Then, second phase: dS/dt = 0 - 0.02 S(t) = -0.02 S(t). So it's exponential decay.

Solution: S(t) = S0 e^{-0.02 t}.

S0 is 9.065, t=10.

So S=9.065 * e^{-0.2}=9.065 *0.8187≈9.065 *0.8187.

Let me compute 9 *0.8187=7.3683, and 0.065 *0.8187≈0.0531. So total ≈7.4214 lb.

Which is approximately 7.42 lb, so option B.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the differential equation setup during the second phase.

In the second phase, the inflow is 2 gal/min of fresh water, so 0 lb of salt. The outflow is 2 gal/min at concentration S(t)/100. So the outflow is 2*(S(t)/100)=0.02 S(t). So dS/dt = 0 -0.02 S(t). So the equation is correct.

So the calculation seems correct. The answer should be around 7.42 lb, so option B.
</think>

The problem involves a mixing process with salt concentration. Initially, the tank has fresh water, and salt is added at a certain rate. The concentration changes over time, and we need to calculate the amount of salt after two phases.

### Phase 1: First 10 minutes
- **Inflow:** 2 gal/min with 0.5 lb/gal, so salt inflow rate is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1 \, \text{lb/min}\).
- **Outflow:** 2 gal/min, so the concentration is \(S(t)/100\).
- **Differential equation:** \( \frac{dS}{dt} = 1 - 0.02S \).
- Solving this gives \( S(t) = 50(1 - e^{-0.02t}) \).
- At \( t = 10 \), \( S(10) = 50(1 - e^{-0.2}) \approx 9.065 \, \text{lb} \).

### Phase 2: Next 10 minutes
- **Inflow:** Fresh water at 2 gal/min, so salt inflow is 0.
- **Outflow:** 2 gal/min, concentration is \( S(t)/100 \), so outflow rate is \( 0.02S(t) \, \text{lb/min} \).
- **Differential equation:** \( \frac{dS}{dt} = -0.02S \).
- Solution: \( S(t) = S_0 e^{-0.02t} \), where \( S_0 = 9.065 \, \text{lb} \).
- At \( t = 10 \), \( S(10) = 9.065 e^{-0.2} \approx 7.42 \, \text{lb} \).

### Answer
The amount of salt after 20 minutes is approximately 7.42 lb, corresponding to option **B**.
