Question:

A 44-year-old female presents to the office for evaluation of a lump on her neck that she noted 1 week ago. She denies any tenderness, fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination reveals a 2-cm freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid. In addition to thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is

Options:

A: Thyroid biopsy
B: Positron emission tomography (PET) scan
C: Lymph node biopsy
D: Computed tomography (CT) scan
E: an iodine131 scan
F: a nuclear thyroid scan
G: Endoscopic examination of the throat
H: fine-needle aspiration
I: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
J: ultrasonography of the thyroid gland

Okay, so I have this medical question here about evaluating a thyroid mass. Let me read it again. The patient is a 44-year-old woman who presented with a lump on her neck and has been seeing no symptoms for a week. No fever, weight loss, or fatigue noted. Physical exam shows a 2-cm freely movable mass in the left lower lobe of the thyroid.

The question is asking what's the most appropriate initial test to investigate this lesion. The options are various imaging techniques and exams.

Hmm, so first, I remember that thyroid masses are often called hypothyroidism, and the size can vary. The presence of a mass usually points towards a thyroid tumor. But the question is about the initial method. So, I think about what's the primary way to diagnose a thyroid mass.

I recall that thyroid function tests are important, like TSH (thyroxine) and free T4. But the question says the exam shows a mass, not function. So, the initial imaging would probably be a scan that can detect the mass.

Options are A through J. Let's look at the options:

A: Thyroid biopsy - That's for when the mass is a tumor, but it's only done post-treatment. The question is about the initial diagnosis, so maybe not the first step.

B: PET scan - Positron emission tomography is useful for cancers, especially those with hyperthyroidism, but not sure if it's the first choice for a simple mass.

C: Lymph node biopsy - If the mass is in the lymph, like a lymph node, then biopsy is needed. But the location here is the lower left lobe of the thyroid, so probably not.

D: CT scan - CT is a standard imaging used for many thyroid issues. It can show where the mass is, size, shape, etc. So, that's a common initial step.

E: Iodine-131 scan - That's a gamma scan, used for thyroid function tests, not for imaging. So probably not the first choice.

F: Nuclear scan - That's similar to E, just the terminology is nuclear instead of iodine. Still not imaging for a mass.

G: Endoscopic exam of the throat - That's for things like fevers or throat issues, not thyroid.

H: Fine-needle aspiration - That's for cysts or tumors in the thyroid, like triad cystic hyperthyroidism. If the mass is only in the thyroid, maybe not. But it's a possible option.

J: Ultrasound - Similar to fine-needle, used for imaging. It can show the size and location, so could be an option.

So, the options that are imaging methods are D (CT), H (FNAs), J (ultrasound). But the question is about the most appropriate initial method.

I think CT scans are standard for imaging of thyroid masses. They can show the size, shape, and location. Fine-needle aspiration can visualize the mass but is more for when the mass is in the thyroid and needs to be examined.

So which one is the first step? Well, CT and ultrasound are both imaging techniques that can help characterize the mass. But CT is a standard imaging method that can often be done before a more invasive procedure.

Wait, but some sources say that for a palpable mass in the thyroid, a CT scan is the most appropriate. Others may suggest a fine needle aspiration to get a more detailed look.

I'm a bit confused. But in the context of the question, it says "most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion." Since the mass is palpable, imaging would be the first step. CT is a standard imaging for such cases.

Alternatively, some may advise to do a FNAs to get a more detailed look, but the question is about initial method, so probably CT.

Wait, but some sources say that for a palpable mass, endoscopic examination is done first, but I don't recall seeing that as an option here. So, the options given are CT, FNA, etc.

So, the answer would be either D (CT) or H (FNAs), but which is more appropriate.

I think CT is the first imaging step for a palpable thyroid mass. So the correct answer would be D or J.

Wait, the options are:

D: CT scan

J: Ultrasound

So, in the options, both are possible. But which is more appropriate?

I think CT is the preferred imaging for a palpable thyroid mass. For example, if the mass is visible on an ultrasound, CT can provide more detailed info.

But some sources suggest that if the mass is palpable, you can do an ultrasound first, then CT. But in the case of a simple mass, CT is the initial imaging.

So the most appropriate initial method is D: CT scan.

Wait, but I'm also considering that the other options. For example, in general, when imaging an thyroid mass, CT is the standard. So, the correct answer would be D.

So, looking at the options again, the correct answer is D.

The question involves evaluating a 44-year-old female presenting with a palpable thyroid mass on exam. The goal is to determine the most appropriate initial imaging method. 

The options provided include CT scans, fine-needle aspiration, and other imaging techniques. CT scans are standard for imaging thyroid masses, as they provide detailed visual information about the size, shape, and location of the lesion. Fine-needle aspiration is typically used for localized cystic hyperthyroidism, not for a palpable mass.

Given that the mass is palpable and the question focuses on the initial method to investigate it, CT scans are the most appropriate choice. They are commonly used for evaluating thyroid masses and are the recommended starting point for such imaging.
