Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about hypothesis testing, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me think about what each part means.

The question says that researchers are conducting an experiment with a significance level of 0.05. The null hypothesis is actually false. Then they change their experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment. I need to figure out which option is correct about the implications of this change.

First, I should recall some basic concepts about hypothesis testing and Type I and Type II errors. The significance level, alpha (α), is the probability of making a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. So, if the null hypothesis is false, the Type I error probability might change because the null is false.

When they double the number of experimental units, that's about increasing the sample size. I remember that increasing sample size generally increases the power of the test. Wait, what's power? Oh right, power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually false. So higher power means a lower Type II error rate (where Type II is failing to reject when it should).

So, if they increase the sample size, power increases. So the probability of a Type II error (β) decreases, and power (which is 1 - β) increases. So looking at the options, I'm looking for an option where power increases and Type II error decreases.

Let me look at the options again. Option A says both Type I error and power increase. That can't be right because Type I depends on the null being true, which it's not in this case. Option B: Type I and Type II both decrease. No, because Type I is about false positives, which would go down if the null is false, but Type II errors are about missing the true effect, which would increase with more power. So B is wrong. Option C: Type I same, power increases. Type I is set at 0.05, so it doesn't change with sample size. So C is wrong because Type I error probability doesn't change by sample size.

Option D: Type II error decreases, power stays same. Wait, power is directly related to the ability to detect an effect. If you increase sample size, power increases. So D says power stays same, which is not correct.

Option E: Type I decreases and Type II increases. Wait, Type I is set at 0.05 and doesn't change, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Type II decreases and power increases. That's what I was thinking earlier. So F says both Type II error and power would both decrease. Wait, no. Wait, Type II error is the probability of Type II, which is the same as the probability of a Type II error. Or wait, Type II error is when you fail to reject when you should. So Type II error rate is β. So power is 1 - β. So when you increase sample size, β decreases, which makes power increase. So for F, it's saying both Type II error (the rate) and power both decrease. No, because the Type II error rate is the probability of Type II, which is the same as 1 - power. So if power increases, Type II error rate (β) decreases. So F says Type II error would decrease and power would decrease? That can't be right because power is only about the probability of Type I and Type II errors. Let me clarify: Type II error (the rate) is β. So if power increases, β decreases. So in F, both Type II error (β) and power both decrease. No, that's not correct. Because power is 1 - β, so if β decreases, power increases. So F is not correct.

Option G: Power and Type II error both decrease. Wait, G says power decreases and Type II decreases. No, Type II is β. So if power increases, then Type II decreases. So G is wrong.

Option H: Type I increases and power decreases. Type I is fixed at 0.05, so this is wrong.

Option I: Power stays same and Type II decreases. No, because power is 1 - β, so changing β affects power. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Type I and Type II both increase. No, because Type I is set at 0.05, so it's fixed. Type II would decrease.

So the correct option is F. Wait, no. Wait, I thought F says Type II error and power both decrease. But that's not right. Let me recheck. Wait, Type II error (the rate) is β. So in F, both Type II error and power are both decreased. That can't be correct. Because if you increase the sample size, Type II error (β) decreases (so the Type II error rate goes down), and power increases (so power goes up). So in F, Type II error would decrease is correct, and power would increase. But F says both decrease, which is wrong. So the correct option should be F's opposite. Wait, what's the correct option?

Wait, the options are about what happens after the change. The question says they use twice as many experimental units, so sample size increases. So, Type I error remains at 0.05, so Type I error probability doesn't change. Type II error rate (β) decreases, so power increases.

Looking for the option where Type II error decreases and power increases. Let me see all the options:

Option F: Type II error would decrease and power would both increase. No, that's not correct because power increases. So in F, it's Type II error and power both increase, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The original setup: the null is false, so Type I error is the probability of rejecting the null when it's false. So, Type I error is the probability of Type I error. In their experiment, perhaps they set alpha at 0.05, but in reality, the null is false. So, Type I error (rejecting when it's false) is now, but wait, Type I error is about rejecting when it's false. So if the null is false, Type I error is the probability of rejecting it incorrectly. So in this case, Type I error is the probability of rejecting the false null, so it's the false positive rate. So if they do have a larger sample size, Type I error is still set at 0.05, so doesn't change. So Type I error wouldn't change.

But wait, the question says: the null is false. What's the effect of changing the experiment? Well, the experiment is modified, but the null is already false. But perhaps the change affects the test's power. Because the test's power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null when it's false. So if you have more data (more sample size), your power increases. So that's a reduction in Type II error (probability of incorrectly not rejecting null) and an increase in power.

So looking for an option that says Type II error (the rate) decreases, and power increases.

Looking at the options:

Option F says both Type II error rate and power would both decrease. No, that's not right. Because power is 1 - β, so if β decreases, power increases.

So looking for the option where Type II error rate decreases and power increases.

Wait, the options are:

A: Type I and power increase. → No, Type I is 0.05, so no.

B: Type I and Type II both decrease. → No, Type I is 0.05, so it's fixed.

C: Type I same, power increases. → Type I same, but power increases. So C is incorrect because Type I is fixed.

D: Type II decrease, power same → No, power increases.

E: Type I decreases → No.

F: Type II decrease, power increase? But F says both decrease. No, because power increases.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

F: The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Because power is 1 - β. So if β decreases, power increases. So in F, it's saying Type II decreases (β) and power increases. So F would have both Type II error (β) and power increase. So F's statement is correct.

Wait, no. Wait, option F says both Type II error and power would both decrease. That's not right because power is 1 - β, so if β decreases, power increases. So F's statement is wrong.

So the correct option is F? Wait, no. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of each option:

Option F: The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase. Hmm, that's not possible because if the probability of Type II error (β) decreases, then power (1-β) increases. So option F is saying that β decreases and power increases. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, in option F: "The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase." So both Type II and power increase. Which is correct. So option F would be correct?

Wait, no. Because Type II error is β, and power is 1-β. So when you increase sample size, β decreases, so (1-β) increases. So the power increases. So, option F says both Type II error (β) and power both increase. Oh, wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The question is, does F say that Type II error would decrease and power would increase? Or that both Type II error and power increase?

Wait, the wording is: "The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase." Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, "both increase" for power. Because power is 1 - β. So if β decreases, power increases. So if F says that both Type II and power increase, that would be correct. Because Type II is β, and power is 1 - β. So if β decreases, power increases.

So F is correct. Wait, but I'm looking at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

F: The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase. No, that's not correct. Because Power is 1 - β, so if Type II error rate (β) decreases, power increases. So both Type II error rate and power increase. So option F's wording says both Type II error and power increase. So that's correct.

Wait, but the wording in option F is: "The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase." Wait, that's not correct. Because power is 1 - β. So if β decreases, power increases. So option F is incorrect because it says power would both increase, which is correct. Because Type II error rate is β, which decreases. So "the probability of a Type II error would decrease" is correct, and "the power would both increase" is also correct.

So the correct option is F.

But wait, I thought earlier that option F is correct, but let me double-check.

Wait, the options are:

F: The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me rephrase:

- Type II error rate is β.

- Power is 1 - β.

If sample size increases, β decreases → power increases.

So, Type II error rate (β) decreases, and power increases. So, which option matches this?

Looking at the options:

Option F: The probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase. So both β and power increase. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, but in option F, the wording says: "the probability of a Type II error would decrease and the power would both increase." Hmm, that's two separate statements: Type II error is decreased, and power is increased. But the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is F. So, the correct answer is F.

The question involves understanding the effects of increasing the sample size on Type I and Type II errors in a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is initially false. Increasing the sample size generally increases the power of the test, which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Power is directly related to the Type II error rate (β), as power = 1 - β. Therefore, as the sample size increases, β decreases, leading to an increase in power.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The Type I error probability (α) is set at 0.05 in the experiment and does not change with sample size.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Type I error remains at 0.05, so it does not decrease. Type II error (β) and the probability of Type II error do not both decrease.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Type I error remains at 0.05, so it does not stay the same. Power increases with a larger sample size.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Type II error (β) decreases as the sample size increases, but the power (1 - β) increases.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Type I error remains at 0.05, so it does not decrease. Type II error (β) decreases, but power does not decrease.
- **Option F**: Correct. As the sample size increases, Type II error (β) decreases, and power (1 - β) increases.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Type II error (β) decreases, but the power (1 - β) increases, not both decrease.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Type I error remains at 0.05, so it does not increase.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Power does not stay the same; it increases with a larger sample size.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Type I error remains at 0.05, so it does not increase.

The correct answer is **Option F**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between sample size increase, Type II error, and power.
