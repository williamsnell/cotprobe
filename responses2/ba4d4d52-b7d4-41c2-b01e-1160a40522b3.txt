Okay, so I have this question about prime factorization, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is to find the prime factors of 77 and express them with exponents where possible. The options are from A to J, each giving a different combination.

First, I need to remember what prime factorization is. From what I recall, it's breaking down a composite number into the product of prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the primes start from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.

Alright, so the number given is 77. I need to find which primes multiply together to give 77. Let's start by checking the smallest primes to see if they divide 77.

The first prime is 2. Is 77 even? No, because it ends with a 7, which is odd. So 2 isn't a factor.

Next, 3. To test divisibility by 3, I can add the digits of 77. 7 + 7 is 14. 14 divided by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 2, so 3 isn't a factor either.

Moving on to 5. Numbers divisible by 5 end with 0 or 5. 77 ends with 7, so 5 isn't a factor.

Next prime is 7. Let's check if 7 divides into 77. 7 times 11 is 77. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me do the multiplication: 7 * 11 equals 77. Oh yeah, that's right. So 7 is a factor, and 11 is another prime factor.

Wait, but I should make sure there are no other factors. So after 7, the next prime is 11. We already saw that 7*11 is 77. So I don't need to check larger primes because 11 is already a prime and the division is exact.

So the prime factors of 77 are 7 and 11. Now, do I need to express them with exponents? Since each appears only once, using exponents isn't necessary. So the prime factorization would just be 7 multiplied by 11.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: 7² ×11². That's 49 × 121, which is way bigger than 77. So no.

Option B: 11² ×13. 121 ×13 is way too big.

Option C: 7 ×13². 13 squared is 169, multiplied by 7 is 1183, which is way off.

Option D: 7 ×11 ×13. Wait, 7×11 is 77, and then multiplying by 13 would be 77×13=1001, which is way more than 77. So D is wrong because 13 is a factor here, but 77 divided by 13 is 5.923, which isn't an integer, so 13 isn't a factor. So D is incorrect.

Option E: 7 ×11. That's exactly 77. So E is correct.

Option F: 7² ×13. That's 49 ×13=637, which is more than 77. So F is wrong.

Option G:7² ×11. 49 ×11=539, which is way too big.

Option H:7 ×11² ×13. 7×121×13 is way too large.

Option I:11 ×13. 143, which is bigger than 77. So I's incorrect.

Option J:7³ ×11. That's 343 ×11=3773, which is way too big.

So the only correct option is E:7 ×11.

The correct prime factorization of 77 is 7 multiplied by 11. Among the options provided, only option E matches this.

Answer: E
