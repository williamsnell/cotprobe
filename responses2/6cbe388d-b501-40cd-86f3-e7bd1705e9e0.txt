Okay, so I've got this question about the refractive index of glass. Hmm, refractive index... I remember that it's related to how light slows down when entering a medium. But wait, the question says the light is plane-polarized when reflected at an angle of 57°47'. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact concepts here, so let me think through it.

Plane-polarized light... Oh right, when light reflects off a boundary between two media, it's partially polarized. The amount depends on the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of the two materials. Oh, and there's the concept of Brewster's angle, I think. Brewster's angle is the angle where the reflected light is fully polarized. So when the light reflects, if the angle is Brewster's, the reflected light is plane-polarized.

Wait, but in this question, the angle given is 57°47'—so is that the Brewster angle? Or is the angle of incidence related to it? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the setup says the light is plane-polarized when reflected. So maybe it's at Brewster's angle. So the angle given, 57°47', is the Brewster angle. Because when the angle of incidence is Brewster's, the reflected light is completely polarized. So if the light is plane-polarized, it must have experienced Brewster's angle.

So the angle of incidence is equal to the Brewster angle. Or wait, is the angle of incidence the same as the angle of reflection? No, wait, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when light reflects off a surface. But Brewster's angle is different. Brewster's angle is the angle of incidence where the reflected light is polarized.

Wait, no, Brewster's angle is the angle of incidence where the reflected light is plane-polarized. So if the incident angle is the Brewster angle, then the reflected light is plane polarized. So in this question, the angle of 57°47' is the Brewster angle. So the angle of incidence would be the same as the Brewster angle? Or wait, no, because when light reflects off a surface, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. So if the angle between the reflected and the normal is the Brewster angle, then the angle of incidence is equal to that. So in this case, the angle of incidence is 57°47'... but wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, when light comes from medium 1 into medium 2, the angle of incidence is the angle between the incoming light and the normal. The Brewster angle (θ_B) is when the reflected light is fully polarized. At Brewster's angle, the reflected light is plane polarized, and the refracted light (if any) is partially polarized, but in this question, the incident light is plane polarized upon reflection. So the angle given is the angle of incidence, I think.

Wait, no, wait. The question says "the light of the green mercury line (5461 Å) is plane-polarized when reflected at an angle of 57°47'". So the angle of 57°47' is the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal, I think. Because when light reflects, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection with respect to the normal. So the angle given is the angle of incidence.

Wait, but Brewster's angle is when the reflected light is plane polarized. So if the angle given is the Brewster angle, then the angle of incidence is equal to that. Or no, wait—no, Brewster's angle is the angle of incidence, not the reflected angle. So the angle of incidence would be 57°47', which is the Brewster angle.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Brewster's angle is when the reflected light is completely plane polarized. The angle of incidence is the same as Brewster's angle. So if the angle between the surface normal and the reflected light is 57°47', then the angle of incidence is 57°47' as well.

So the angle of incidence is 57.78 degrees (since 47 minutes is 47/60 = 0.7833, so 57.7833 degrees).

Wait, wait, 57 degrees 47 minutes. 47 minutes is 47/60 = 0.7833. So 57 + 0.7833 = 57.7833 degrees.

So the angle of incidence is 57.7833 degrees.

Now, the refractive index n of a material can be found using the formula related to Brewster's angle. The formula is tan(theta_B) = n, where theta_B is Brewster's angle. Wait, no, wait. No, the formula is tan(theta_B) = n where n is the refractive index of the glass relative to the incident medium (air). Wait, but wait, I think it's the other way around. Let me think.

The formula is tan(theta_B) = n_glass / n_incident. But when the light is coming from air (n=1) into glass (n_g), the condition for Brewster's angle is tan(theta_B) = n_g / n_air. Since n_air is 1, so tan(theta_B) = n_g.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the formula for Brewster's angle is tan(theta_B) = n_glass / n_incident_medium. So if the light is coming from air into glass, n_incident_medium is 1, so tan(theta_B) = n_glass.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the formula is tan(theta_B) = n_v / n_i, where n_i is the refractive index of the incident medium, and n_v is the refractive index of the refracting medium. So when the light is going from air (n_i=1) into glass (n_v = n), tan(theta_B) = n.

Wait, but I might be getting it backwards. Let me make sure. Oh, wait, no, the formula is tan(theta_B) = n_glass / n_air. Since n_air is 1, tan(theta_B) = n_glass.

But wait, no, the formula is tan(theta_B) = n_glass / n_incident. So when light goes from air (n=1) to glass (n_g), the angle is theta_B. So tan(theta_B) = n_glass / 1 = n_glass.

Wait, no, because when light goes from a medium with higher refractive index to a lower, the formula is tan(theta_B) = n_incident / n_glass. Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The correct formula is tan(theta_B) = n_glass / n_incident_medium. So when light is going from air (n=1) into glass (n_g), then tan(theta_B) = n_g / 1 = n_g.

Wait, that makes sense because when the refractive index of the glass is higher than air (n=1), the angle of incidence is theta_B. So if the angle is 57.78 degrees, then n_glass = tan(theta_B).

So theta_B is 57.78 degrees, so n_glass = tan(57.78 degrees).

Calculating that, let me find tan(57.78 degrees). Let's see, 57 degrees is 57. So tan(57) is approximately 1.5399. What about 57.78?

Wait, 57.78 degrees. Let me compute tan(57.78). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate it. Let me think: 57.78 degrees is about 57°47', which is 57 + 47/60 = 57.7833 degrees.

Maybe I should use a calculator. Let me compute tan(57.78 degrees).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inverse to get the angle. Let me think, but perhaps it's easier to use a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember some standard angles.

But wait, perhaps I can think of known angles. For instance, 57 degrees is about 1.5399 as I said. 58 degrees is about 1.6003. So 57.78 is between 57 and 58.

The difference between 57 and 58: 1 degree. So 0.78 degrees is about 46.8 minutes, but perhaps I should compute how much tan increases per degree.

The derivative of tan(x) is sec^2(x), which is about 1/(cos^2(x)) which is approximately 1 + x² (for small x in radians), but since we're dealing with degrees, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find more accurately using the calculator approach.

But perhaps I should just compute it.

Wait, tan(57.78 degrees) = ?

Using a calculator, perhaps. Let's compute it.

Wait, but I don't have a calculator here, but let's proceed.

Wait, 57 degrees is 1.53990.

58 degrees is 1.60033.

So 0.78 degrees beyond 57 would be 57.78.

The difference between 57 and 58 degrees is 1 degree, which corresponds to a tan increase of about 0.06043 (from 1.5399 to 1.60033).

So for 0.78 degrees, the increase is 0.78/1 * 0.06043 = approximately 0.0472.

So tan(57.78) is approximately 1.5399 + 0.0472 = 1.5871.

Wait, but let me think again. Because between 57 and 58, the tan increases by about 0.0604 per degree. So 0.78 degrees would be approximately 0.78 * 0.06043 ≈ 0.0471. So 1.5399 + 0.0471 = 1.5870.

So around 1.587.

Looking at the options, let me see:

Option A: 1.6421

B: 1.5461

C:1.5000

D:1.5307

E:1.5747

F:1.6234

G:1.5600

H:1.6057

I:1.6789

J:1.5869

So my approximate calculation is around 1.587, which is very close to option J (1.5869).

So the refractive index is approximately 1.586, which is option J.

So the correct answer is J.

To determine the refractive index of the glass, we use the concept of Brewster's angle. Brewster's angle is the angle of incidence at which the reflected light is plane-polarized. In this case, the angle of 57°47' is the Brewster angle (θ_B). At Brewster's angle, the refractive index of the glass (n_glass) can be calculated using the tangent function:

\[
n_{\text{glass}} = \tan(\theta_B)
\]

First, convert the angle of 57°47' to decimal degrees:
\[
57^\circ 47' = 57 + \frac{47}{60} = 57.78^\circ
\]

Next, calculate the tangent of 57.78°. Using approximations for standard angles and interpolating between known values:
- \(\tan(57^\circ) \approx 1.5399\)
- \(\tan(58^\circ) \approx 1.6003\)

The angle 57.78° is 0.78° beyond 57°, so the increase in \(\tan\) can be approximated as:
\[
\Delta \tan = \frac{0.78}{1} \times 0.06043 \approx 0.0472
\]

Thus:
\[
\tan(57.78^\circ) \approx 1.5399 + 0.0472 = 1.5871
\]

This value is very close to option J (1.5869). Therefore, the refractive index of the glass is approximately 1.5869.

**Correct Answer:** J
