Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral from 0 to sqrt(3) of 1/(1 + x²) dx. Hmm, I remember that integrals of the form 1/(a² + x²) are standard. The integral of 1/(1 + x²) is arctan(x), right? So I think the integral would be arctan(x) evaluated from 0 to sqrt(3).

Wait, let me make sure. Yeah, the derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1 + x²), so that's correct. So substituting the limits, I take arctan(sqrt(3)) minus arctan(0). Arctan(0) is 0, so I just need arctan(sqrt(3)).

What's arctan(sqrt(3))? I remember that tan(π/3) is sqrt(3) because tan(π/3) is about 1.732, which is sqrt(3). So arctan(sqrt(3)) is π/3. And π is approximately 3.1416, so π/3 is about 1.0472.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The integral from 0 to sqrt(3) gives an area under the curve of 1/(1 + x²). The arctangent function increases as x increases, so the area should be between 0 and π/3. That makes sense because sqrt(3) is about 1.732, which is a positive number, so the function is positive there.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.0472. That's π/3, which matches my calculation. So I think the correct answer is option C.

The integral \(\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}} \frac{dx}{1+x^2}\) is evaluated using the antiderivative of \(1/(1 + x^2)\), which is \(\arctan(x)\). Evaluating from 0 to \(\sqrt{3}\), we get \(\arctan(\sqrt{3}) - \arctan(0)\). Since \(\arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \pi/3 \approx 1.0472\), the correct answer is:

C: 1.0472.

Answer: C
