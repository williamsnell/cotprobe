Okay, so I've got this problem about a car tire's pressure change during a temperature change. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my science classes that the pressure of a gas depends on temperature and volume. Oh wait, but the volume here is constant, right? So the tire isn't expanding or contracting, so the change in pressure is due to the change in temperature. 

The question says the tire was inflated to 24 psi on a winter day (-5°C). Then on a summer day, the temperature is 35°C. The problem states there's no leaks, so the volume is constant. I think this is an ideal gas scenario, so I should probably use the combined gas law. But wait, since the volume doesn't change, maybe it's the ideal gas law with two states.

The formula I think is P1 * V1 / T1 = P2 * V2 / T2. But since V1 = V2, the equation simplifies to P1 / T1 = P2 / T2. Since temperature is involved in Kelvin, I need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.

Wait, let me get the numbers right. The initial temperature is -5°C. To convert to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So that's 273.15 -5 = 268.15 K. The final temperature is 35°C, which is 35 + 273.15 = 308.15 K.

So P1 is 24 psi at T1 = 268.15 K. P2 is what we're solving for at T2 = 308.15 K. So applying the formula: P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1).

Plugging in the numbers: 24 * (308.15 / 268.15). Let's calculate that. 308.15 divided by 268.15 is approximately 1.145. So 24 * 1.145 is about 27.48 psi. 

Looking at the options, option C is 26, D is 30, etc. Hmm, 27.48 is closer to 27.5, but the options don't have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely. 308.15 / 268.15. Let me compute that. 268.15 * 1.14 is about 308.15? Wait, 268.15 * 1.14 is approximately 268.15 * 1 = 268.15, plus 268.15 *0.14 is about 37.541. So 268.15 + 37.541 = 305.691. Hmm, but we have 308.15. So 1.145 would be better.

Wait, let me get that right. 268.15 * x = 308.15. So x = 308.15 / 268.15. Let me compute 268.15 * 1.14 = 268.15 * (1 + 0.14) = 268.15 + 37.541 = 305.691, which is less than 308.15. The difference is 308.15 - 305.691 = 2.459. So 2.459 / 268.15 ≈ 0.00917. So x ≈ 1.14917. So about 1.1492.

So P2 = 24 * 1.1492 = let me compute that. 24 * 1 =24, 24 * 0.1492 is around 3.5808. So 24 + 3.5808 = 27.5808 psi. So about 27.58 psi.

Looking at the options, the closest is C:26 and D:30. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 27.58, which is closer to 28. But the options don't have 28. So maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula P1 * T2 = P2 * T1? Wait, no, because the formula is (P1*(T2))/(T1) = P2. So that's what I did.

Wait, maybe I should consider the pressure change from winter to summer, so the volume is constant. So the pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (in Kelvin).

Wait, let me check the initial calculation again. The initial temperature is -5°C, which is 268.15 K. The summer is 35°C, 308.15 K.

The ratio is (308.15)/(268.15) is approximately 1.149. So 24 * 1.149 = 24 * 1.149. Let me compute that precisely.

24 * 1.149 = 24*(1 + 0.149) = 24 + 24*0.149.

Compute 24 * 0.149: 0.1 *24=2.4, 0.04*24=0.96, 0.009*24=0.216. Summing 2.4+0.96=3.36, +0.216=3.576. So 24 +3.576=27.576 psi. So approximately 27.58.

Looking at the options: the closest would be 28, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of the temperature conversion.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-calculate the initial temperature. Oh wait, -5°C is 268.15 K? Let me double-check that.

Yes, because 0°C is 273.15 K, so -5°C is 273.15 -5 = 268.15 K. Correct.

Hmm. So why isn't 27.58 an option? Let me look back at the options. The options are A to J, with numbers like 28, 29, 30, 31, etc. Oh wait, option E is 28, F is 29, G is 27, H is 31, etc.

So 27.58 is closer to 28 than to 27. How about if I use more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should do the division more accurately. 308.15 / 268.15.

Let me compute 308.15 ÷ 268.15.

268.15 × 1.14 is 305.691. The difference is 308.15 - 305.691 = 2.459.

So 2.459 / 268.15 is approximately 0.00917. So it's 1.14 + 0.00917 ≈ 1.14917. So 1.14917.

So 24 * 1.14917 = 24 * 1.14917.

Break it down: 24 * 1 =24; 24 *0.14917 = let's compute that.

24 * 0.1 =2.4; 24 *0.04 =0.96; 24 *0.00917=0.22008. Sum: 2.4 +0.96=3.36 +0.22008=3.58008.

So 24 +3.58008=27.58008 psi.

So approximately 27.58 psi. So looking at the options, the closest is E:28, but wait, why isn't 28 an option? Because none of the options have 28.

Wait, looking back at the options, the options are:

A:35, B:32, C:26, D:30, E:28, F:29, G:27, H:31, I:33, J:34.

So option G is 27, and E is 28. So 27.58 is 27.58, so about 27.6, which is closer to 28 than 27.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the initial temperature. Because when converting Celsius to Kelvin, it's T(K)= T(°C)+273.15. So for -5°C, it's 268.15 K, correct. So that part is right.

Wait, but maybe the problem intended the initial temperature to be in lb/in², but I think no, it's given as 24 lb/in², and the question is about the pressure change. So maybe the formula is correct.

Wait, another approach is the ratio of the pressures should be the ratio of the temperatures, since volume is constant. So P1 / T1 = P2 / T2 → P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1).

So let me compute it again. P1=24 psi, T1=268.15, T2=308.15.

So 24 * (308.15 /268.15) = 24 * 1.149 ≈ 27.58.

Wait, but perhaps the problem intended to use the same units for pressure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: could the problem consider the pressure change from winter to summer, perhaps using the Fahrenheit scale? But the question states the pressure is in lb/in², which is psi, so that's in the metric/English system, so Kelvin is the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 308.15 divided by 268.15 is approximately 1.149 (as before). So 24 * 1.149 is approximately 27.58. So closest to 28 psi.

But the options don't have 28. Wait, looking at the options again:

The options are:

A:35

B:32

C:26

D:30

E:28

F:29

G:27

H:31

I:33

J:34

So option E is 28 and G is 27. So 27.58 is between 27 and 28. Typically, when rounded to the nearest whole number, 27.58 is closer to 28, but perhaps the options are rounded to the nearest whole number.

Alternatively, the options don't have 28, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 24 * (308.15 / 268.15) more precisely.

308.15 divided by 268.15.

Let me do this division:

268.15 * 1.1492 = ?

Wait, 268.15 * 1.1492.

Let me compute 268.15 *1=268.15; 268.15 *0.14=37.541; 268.15 *0.0092= approximately 2.474. So 268.15 +37.541=305.691 + 2.474= 308.165. So 268.15 * 1.1492 = 308.165, which is very close to 308.15.

So 308.15 / 268.15 ≈1.1492.

So 24 *1.1492 =24 + (24 *0.1492). Let's compute 24 *0.1492.

0.1 *24=2.4, 0.04*24=0.96, 0.0092*24=0.2208.

Adding those: 2.4+0.96=3.36; 3.36+0.2208=3.5808.

So 24 +3.5808=27.5808 psi.

So approximately 27.58 psi.

Looking at the options, the closest is E (28) and G (27). 27.58 is closer to 28 than to 27. So why isn't 28 an option? Wait, looking again, the options are:

Options:

A:35

B:32

C:26

D:30

E:28

F:29

G:27

H:31

I:33

J:34.

So E is 28, which is the nearest. But wait, this suggests that the correct answer is E)28.

But wait, the initial calculation might not be precise. Another way to approach this: using the principle that pressure is directly proportional to temperature when volume is constant.

So the equation is P1 / T1 = P2 / T2.

So I can write P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1).

So plugging in: P2 =24 * (308.15 /268.15) =24 * (1.14917)≈27.58 psi.

Hmm, but none of the options is 27.58. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation is correct, and the closest option is E)28.

Wait, but the question gives four options, including E and G. So 27.58 is closer to 28 than to 27. So the answer must be E)28.

Wait, but wait a moment. Oh, perhaps the initial and final temperatures were given in Fahrenheit? No, the question states it's in degrees Celsius, I think. Because winter is -5, summer is 35.

Wait, but wait another point: perhaps the problem uses the fact that the temperature change is from winter to summer, and the pressure increases because of the temperature rise. But perhaps the formula is P2 = P1 * (T2/T1), which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should reevaluate the calculation with more precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute 308.15 / 268.15 precisely.

Compute 268.15 × 1.14917 = 308.15. Let's calculate 268.15 ×1.14917.

Wait, 1.14917 is approximately 1.1492.

So 268.15 *1 =268.15.

268.15 * 0.1492 = ?

Calculate 268.15 *0.1 =26.815.

268.15 *0.04 =10.726.

268.15 *0.0092 = let's compute 268.15 *0.01=2.6815, so 0.0092 is just 2.6815 *0.92 = 2.6815 *0.9=2.41335 and 2.6815*0.02=0.05363. So 2.41335+0.05363=2.467.

So 0.1492 *268.15 =26.815 +10.726 +2.467 =39.908.

So 268.15 *1.1492 =268.15 +39.908=308.058. Hmm, which is 308.058, very close to 308.15. So that's correct.

So P2=24 ×1.1492≈27.58.

Hmm, but the options don't have 27.58. The closest would be 28 or 27. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, wait another approach: perhaps the problem uses the same pressure units but different temperature units. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the same temperature units, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using the equation for pressure change without conversion to Kelvin. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because Kelvin is necessary for the gas law.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the pressure change is due to the temperature change, but without considering the actual formula.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem to see if I missed any part.

Wait, the problem statement is:

"The car tire was inflated to 24 psi on a winter day (-5°C). What would be the final pressure (on a summer day, 35°C) assuming no leaks?"

Wait, so no, the initial calculation is correct. So the answer should be E)28.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the pressure change when the temperature increases from winter to summer, but perhaps the pressure increases more than before because the summer day is significantly warmer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the answer is E)28.

But wait, wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me think again.

The initial temperature is -5°C, which is 268.15 K. The final is 35°C → 308.15 K. So the ratio is 308.15 /268.15 ≈1.149.

So 24 psi *1.149 ≈27.58 psi.

So the correct answer according to the calculations is approximately 27.58 psi. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to use the same pressure units, but perhaps the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit is being used? No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the summer day is 30°C, but I don't know.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the ratio of the absolute temperatures.

T1 = -5°C →268.15 K.

T2 =35°C →308.15 K.

T2/T1 =308.15 /268.15 ≈1.1492.

So the pressure increases by that factor.

So 24 *1.1492 ≈27.58.

So the answer is approximately 27.58 psi.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is E)28.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation to be done without using the Kelvin system.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because the gas law requires absolute temperatures.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 27.58, which is closest to 28 psi. So option E.

Wait, but wait another moment: perhaps the problem intended to use the formula P1 * T2 = P2 * T1, but wait, that's the same as P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1). So that's the same as the ratio.

So I think the correct answer should be E)28.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the closest is 28 and 27. But according to the calculation, it's 27.58, so closer to 28.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options have 28 and 27, but perhaps I should consider that the problem is using an approximation where the temperatures are converted to Fahrenheit?

Wait, no, the problem gives the temperatures in Celsius.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use the formula P1/T1 = P2/T2, but with the temperatures in Fahrenheit, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the temperatures in Fahrenheit and then use the proportionality.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the problem uses the same pressure units, but perhaps the formula is just P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1), but perhaps the temperature conversion is incorrect.

Wait, let me re-calculate the initial and final temperatures.

Wait, initial temperature: -5°C →268.15 K.

Final:35°C →308.15 K.

So the ratio is 308.15 /268.15 ≈1.1492.

So P2=24 *1.1492≈27.58 psi.

So according to the calculation, the correct answer should be approximately 27.58 psi, which is closest to 28. So option E.

Wait, but looking at the options, G is 27. So perhaps the intended correct answer is G)27.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's E)28.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should look for any alternative approach. Another way is to compute the initial pressure in terms of a hypothetical year.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the number of days between winter and summer, but that seems besides the point.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward, and the answer is 28 psi, which is option E.

So after going through all the possible angles, the correct answer is E)28.
</think>

The problem involves determining the pressure of a car tire after a temperature change. Since the volume is constant, the pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (in Kelvin). The initial temperature is -5°C, which converts to 268.15 K. The final temperature is 35°C, which converts to 308.15 K. Using the formula:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

we calculate:

\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_2 = 24 \cdot \frac{308.15}{268.15} \approx 24 \cdot 1.149 \approx 27.58 \, \text{psi}
\]

The closest option to 27.58 is **28 psi (option E)**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: E
