The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A purchaser orally agreed with the seller to buy seller's house for $100,000. The purchaser gave the seller a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price. Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the check served as a form of acceptance of the offer.
B: Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.
C: Yes, because the seller cannot revoke an offer once a down payment has been made.
D: No, because the oral agreement was not legally binding without the seller's signature on the offer form.
E: No, because the offer was not accepted  prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.
F: Yes, because the written offer and check constituted a legally binding contract.
G: Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.
H: No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.
I: No, because the seller had not yet cashed the check, indicating no formal acceptance of the offer.
J: No, because the post-dated check does not constitute a legally binding agreement.

Okay, so I've got this real estate contract question here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these legal concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says that a purchaser orally agreed to buy the seller's house for $100,000. They gave a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price, which is $5,000. Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, the purchaser received an offer of their full asking price, $120,000, from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser is suing for specific performance, claiming that the oral understanding and the written offer plus the check form an enforceable agreement.

The options are A to J, and I need to figure out which is correct. I remember that specific performance usually applies in real estate when the property is not yet sold, but sometimes there are exceptions.

The key points are: oral agreement, written offer, check, and acceptance. The seller called the purchaser, but the purchaser sued. So the seller didn't accept the offer before the check was deposited.

Wait, but under the Uniform Commercial Code, an oral agreement is not legally binding unless there's a written agreement. So in this case, since the offer is written, maybe it's enforceable. But the seller called, which is a form of acceptance. But wait, does a written acceptance count as acceptance? I think in some jurisdictions, if a written offer is accepted by a third party, it becomes legally binding. But only if the offer is accepted by a person, not a third party. Oh, but the seller called the purchaser, which is a third party. So that might not count as acceptance.

Wait, but the seller called the purchaser, but the purchaser didn't accept the offer until after the check was presented. So perhaps the seller didn't have formal acceptance, making the offer unenforceable. So the seller's offer was unaccepted, which could mean it's not a legally enforceable contract, meaning the purchaser couldn't perform the specific performance.

But wait, the options are about whether the purchaser will prevail. Let me look at each option.

Option E: No, because the offer was not accepted prior to the seller having the right to sell to anyone. Hmm, I'm not sure. The right to sell to anyone is part of the contract, but if the seller is trying to accept, maybe it's about whether the offer was accepted by a third party.

Option D: No because the oral agreement isn't binding without the seller's signature. So without the seller's signature, the oral agreement isn't enforceable. But the written offer and check are part of the agreement. So maybe that's a factor here.

Wait, let's think about the enforceability of the oral agreement. In some jurisdictions, an oral contract is subject to acceptance. If the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept until after the check was presented, does that mean the seller didn't have acceptance? Or does the written offer serve as a form of acceptance?

I think that's the issue here. In the absence of a written acceptance, the offer might not be valid. But in this case, the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept it until after the check, which suggests that the seller did accept it, but in the form of a call, which is a third party acceptance. But this might not count as formal acceptance.

Wait, if the seller accepted by calling, that's a type of acceptance. But in some cases, the seller can accept by calling, but the buyer might not accept. So if the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept, then the offer is unaccepted, making it unenforceable.

So then, the seller's offer wouldn't be legally binding, so the purchaser can't perform specific performance. So the purchaser would likely lose, hence option E would be the answer, right? Because the offer wasn't accepted until after the seller had the right to sell.

Wait, but the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept. Let me think about whether that's enough for acceptance. In some contexts, a call by the seller to the purchaser constitutes acceptance. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. I think in some states, acceptance by a third party is not sufficient, but in others, it might be. Alternatively, the seller might have accepted by giving a check, but in this case, the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept.

Alternatively, perhaps the seller's written offer and the check are both part of the contract. But if the seller called, maybe the check was part of the contract? Wait, no— the check is a written offer, but perhaps the seller's acceptance is through the written offer. So the seller's acceptance would be the written offer and the check.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the seller's acceptance must be in writing. So if the seller doesn't have a written agreement, perhaps the oral part isn't binding. So the oral understanding isn't legally binding, making the written offer unenforceable, thus the agreement isn't enforceable. So the purchaser can't perform specific performance, so the answer would be E.

Wait, but the options are looking for the purchaser's likely outcome. So the question is whether the purchaser will prevail. So in this scenario, because the seller called but the purchaser didn't accept, the seller might have accepted, but in reality, maybe the agreement is unenforceable because there's no written agreement, making the offer invalid. So the purchaser would lose, so the answer would be E: No, because the offer was not accepted prior to the seller having the right to sell to anyone.

Wait, another thought. Does the seller have the right to accept the offer even if he called? Because the seller is trying to sell, and the purchaser is trying to buy. So if the seller accepts by calling, that's a type of acceptance. But not sure if that's enough. Alternatively, maybe the seller's written offer is sufficient as acceptance, and the written check is not enough, but the seller's call is, but the seller hasn't actually accepted yet. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think about the elements of a legally binding contract for specific performance. It needs: (1) a contract, (2) an offer and acceptance, and (3) consideration. The offer must be accepted by a third party. So in this case, the seller called the purchaser, which might count as acceptance. But if the written offer is considered, and the seller's call is not part of it, perhaps it's sufficient.

Wait, but the written offer is a separate document. The seller's call is a third party acceptance. So the seller's written offer is the offer for the contract, but if the seller accepts by third party (which is a form of acceptance), then maybe the contract is valid. Or perhaps not, because the seller hasn't written the acceptance.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option G says yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds, the check, and the written offer. So if they all agree, that's a good sign for the contract. But if the seller hasn't accepted by a formal third party, then that's an issue. So the written offer is part of the agreement, but the seller called, which isn't a formal acceptance. So if the written offer is accepted by the third party, then the agreement is valid.

Wait, another angle: the seller's written offer and the check. The check is a written form of consideration. So the seller's written offer is for the consideration of the check. So perhaps the seller's written offer and the written check form an agreement. But then, the seller called, which is a third party acceptance. So that's a form of acceptance. So perhaps the seller accepted, and the contract is valid.

But then, the purchaser didn't accept by a third party until after the check. So perhaps the seller accepted, but the purchaser didn't accept. So the contract is unenforceable because the seller's acceptance was done via a call, but the purchaser didn't accept.

Alternatively, perhaps the written offer and the written check are both binding, so the agreement is enforceable. But if the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept until after the check, perhaps the seller didn't actually accept. So perhaps the seller's written offer was accepted, but the purchaser didn't accept, so the contract isn't enforceable.

Wait, but the seller called— perhaps that's enough for acceptance. So the seller's acceptance is done by the third party, making it valid. So the written offer is part of the agreement, and the seller's acceptance is via a call, which is enough for acceptance. So the contract is valid, and the purchaser can perform specific performance.

But wait, the check is for 5% of the price, so the purchaser is effectively paying $5,000 upfront. The seller is entitled to the balance, which is $95,000. But if the contract is valid, the purchaser can perform.

But then, why would the purchaser lose? Because the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept until after the check. So perhaps the seller's acceptance was done through the call, which is a form of acceptance, but the purchaser didn't accept. So the seller's written offer is accepted by the third party, but not the purchaser. So the contract is enforceable. Therefore, the purchaser can perform.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe the seller's acceptance is required to have the contract valid. So if the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept, then the seller's acceptance is not there. So the contract is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the seller's acceptance is not part of the contract, but a separate action. So the written offer and the check form an enforceable contract, but the seller's acceptance via the call is not part of it.

Wait, but the seller's call is a form of acceptance, but that might not be sufficient. The seller's agreement is a contract, and the buyer's acceptance is needed to have the contract valid. So if the seller's acceptance is done by the third party, then the contract is valid. But if the third party doesn't accept, then the contract is invalid.

So in this scenario, the seller's written offer and the check are part of the contract. But the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept. So the seller's acceptance via the call is not part of the contract. Therefore, the contract is unenforceable, and the purchaser cannot perform.

So if that's the case, the purchaser would lose, so the answer would be E: No, because the offer was not accepted prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.

Wait, but the seller called, but the purchaser didn't accept until after the check. So maybe the seller accepted, but the purchaser didn't accept. So the contract is valid, but the purchaser can't perform because the seller hasn't accepted the offer. Or perhaps the seller's own acceptance is necessary for the contract.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the key point is that the seller called, which is a form of acceptance, but the purchaser didn't accept. So the contract is unenforceable, making the purchaser unable to perform. So the answer is E.

The question revolves around whether the purchaser can enforce a specific performance under a contract based on an oral understanding, written offer, and a post-dated check. The seller called the purchaser but did not accept the offer until after the check. The analysis focuses on the enforceability of the contract and the acceptability of the seller's acceptance.

1. **Key Elements of a Contract for Specific Performance**: 
   - A contract must include an offer and acceptance.
   - Acceptance must be by a third party.
   - Consideration must be present.

2. **Analysis of the Scenario**:
   - The purchaser received an offer of $120,000 from another party (post-dated check for $5,000).
   - The seller called the purchaser, which is a form of acceptance.
   - The purchaser did not accept the offer until after the seller had the right to sell to anyone.

3. **Impact of the Seller's Call**:
   - The seller's call constitutes a type of acceptance, but it may not be sufficient on its own.
   - The written offer and check are part of the contract but were accepted by a third party (the seller's call).
   - The seller's acceptance is not part of the contract, only a third-party action.

4. **Implications for Enforceability**:
   - Without a written agreement or formal acceptance, the oral understanding may not be legally binding.
   - The seller's call is a form of acceptance, but it is not sufficient to enforce the contract.
   - The written offer and check are valid, but the seller's acceptance via the call is not part of the contract.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The purchaser cannot enforce the contract because the seller's acceptance was not accepted by the purchaser, despite the seller's written offer and check.
   - The seller's call was a form of acceptance, but it is not sufficient to make the contract enforceable. The contract is valid on its own terms, but the purchaser cannot perform specific performance.
