Okay, so I've got this biology question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down slowly because I'm a bit rusty on my cell biology concepts.

The question is about the type of cleavage symmetry that arises from early cell divisions at an oblique angle to the polar axis. Hmm, I remember that cell division and cleavage are important in development, especially in organisms like embryos.

Wait, cleavage symmetry refers to the division of a cell into symmetrical parts. There are different types of cleavage. Let me think. Oh right, there are various forms like radial, spiral, transverse, and others. 

I recall that radial cleavage is when a cell divides into symmetrical layers around a central axis. That happens in some organisms, like the radial symmetry in sea stars or jellyfish. So, radial cleavage is when the cell divides radially, which is like around a circle.

But what about oblique cleavage? Oblique angles mean that the division isn't directly along the polar axis. The polar axis is the imaginary line pointing towards the center of the cell, I think. So, if the cleavage happens at an angle that's not directly along this line, that would be oblique.

Wait, I remember something about holoblastic and meroblastic cleavages. Oh, right. Meroblastic cleavage is when the entire body is divided into layers around the central axis, like how a zygote divides into the embryo. That's more of a radial or bilaterally symmetrical division.

Wait, no. Meroblastic cleavage is when the entire structure divides into layers, with each layer being a shell. So it's more like radial cleavage. But the question is about cleavage symmetry at an oblique angle. 

Alternatively, I think spiral cleavage is when each layer rotates around the central axis, like how a sunflower has layers spiraling around the center. That would be a different symmetry altogether.

Wait, what about transverse cleavage? Transverse cleavage is when the cell divides into parts along a plane that's perpendicular to the polar axis. So that's more like the radial cleavage, but if the angle is oblique, maybe it's a different type.

Wait, maybe the correct term for this is oblique cleavage. Oh! Because oblique cleavage implies that the cell division is not along the polar axis but at an angle to it. So, the symmetry is along an oblique plane.

Looking at the options, option J is oblique cleavage. That must be the answer. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up with other types.

So, the options are:

A: rotational cleavage (like radially)
B: radial cleavage (radially)
C: transverse cleavage (perpendicular)
D: holoblastic cleavage (the entire body is divided into layers)
E: concentric cleavage (like layers around the center)
F: superficial cleavage (like outer layers)
G: bilateral cleavage (like a plane)
H: spiral cleavage (spiral)
I: meroblastic cleavage (meroblastic is a type of radial cleavage)
J: oblique cleavage (this would be the one with the oblique angle)

So the question is about cleavage symmetry at an oblique angle to the polar axis. So the symmetry is not radial (since that's along the axis), nor is it transverse (perpendicular), concentric (layers around center), superficial (outer layers), or maybe radial again. The only option left is J, oblique cleavage.

Wait another thought: Meroblastic cleavage is a type of radial cleavage, I think. Because meroblastic is when the entire body is divided into layers. So if the cleavage is at an angle, that's oblique cleavage. So the correct term is J, oblique cleavage.

The question asks about the type of cleavage symmetry that arises from early cell divisions at an oblique angle to the polar axis. To determine the correct answer, it's important to evaluate the options based on their definitions and biological context.

- **Rotational cleavage** refers to radial symmetry, where the cell divides around a central axis.
- **Radial cleavage** involves division around a central axis, which is perpendicular to the polar axis.
- **Transverse cleavage** occurs along a plane perpendicular to the polar axis, typically radial.
- **Holoblastic cleavage** involves the entire body being divided into layers around the central axis, such as in radial divisions.
- **Concentric cleavage** refers to layers surrounding the central axis, such as concentric divisions.
- **Superficial cleavage** involves outer layers, which is not relevant here.
- **Bilateral cleavage** refers to division along a plane, which is not applicable.
- **Spiral cleavage** involves rotation around the central axis, which is unrelated.
- **Oblique cleavage** is the correct term for division at an angle to the polar axis, which matches the question's description.

Given that the cleavage occurs at an oblique angle to the polar axis, the correct term is **oblique cleavage**. This eliminates other options and aligns with the biological context of radial and oblique divisions.

Answer: J
