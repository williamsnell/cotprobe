Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me read it again and try to think through it.

The question is about modeling a nanostructure with an electron confined in a rectangular region. The sides are L1=1.0 nm and L2=2.0 nm. The electron is subjected to thermal motion with a typical energy equal to kT. They're asking how low the temperature should be so that the thermal energy is comparable to the zero-point energy.

Hmm, okay, I've heard about the zero-point energy before. I think the zero-point energy is the minimum energy that a quantum mechanical system may have, and it's not zero. So for an electron, even in its lowest energy state, there's some energy there. That's the zero-point energy.

And the thermal energy is kT, right? So we want kT to be about equal to the zero-point energy. But wait, how do I find the zero-point energy for this two-dimensional confinement?

I remember that for a particle in a box, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is something like E = (h² / 8mL²) multiplied by (n_x² + n_y²), where L is the length in that direction, and n_x and n_y are quantum numbers (like 1, 2, 3... etc.). Oh wait, but wait, the problem says the electron is confined to a rectangular region, but doesn't specify the quantum numbers. So, I think the zero-point energy would correspond to the lowest possible state, which would be n_x=1 and n_y=1. Because that's the lowest energy state.

So the zero-point energy (E0) is (h² / 8m) [ (1² + 1²) / (L1² L2²) ) ]? Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise. The energy levels for a particle in a 2D box are given by E_n = (h² / 8m) (n_x² / L1² + n_y² / L2²), where n_x and n_y are positive integers (1,2,3...). So the ground state is when both n_x and n_y are 1.

So E0 = (h² / 8m) (1/L1² + 1/L2²). Wait, but wait, the question here is about when kT equals the zero-point energy. So we can set E0 ≈ kT.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the 2D box energy.

Ah, yes, the formula for a 2D box is E = (h² / (8 m a²)) (n^2), where a is the size in that direction. For the ground state, n=1. So for a 2D box with sides L1 and L2, the ground state energy would be E0 = (h² / (8 m)) (1/L1² + 1/L2²) ) * (1/1^2), since n_x and n_y are both 1.

Wait, no, wait. Because the Box is in 2D, so each dimension contributes a term. So the total energy is (h²/(8m))(1/(L1²) + 1/(L2²)).

Wait, but wait, the formula is E = (n_x² + n_y²) (h²/(8m L²)), where L is the length in a particular direction. So for the ground state, n_x = n_y = 1. So E0 = (1 + 1) (h²/(8m)) (1/(L1^2 L2^2)), wait no, no, wait, no. The denominator should be L1^2 for x-direction and L2^2 for y-direction. So yeah, E0 is (h²/(8m L1²)) * 1 + (h²/(8m L2² )) * 1. So E0 = (h²/(8m)) (1/L1² + 1/L2²) * 1. So that's correct.

So E0 = (h²/(8 m)) (1/(L1^2) + 1/(L2^2)) )

Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing 1D and 2D here. In 1D, the energy is (n² h²)/(8 m L²). So in 2D, it's the sum of the two 1D energies. So yeah, E0 is as I wrote.

So the thermal energy is kT. So set E0 = kT.

So E0 = (h²/(8 m)) (1/(L1²) + 1/(L2²)) ) = k T.

We can solve for T.

But let me get the units right. h is Planck's constant, which is 6.626e-34 J·s. m is the mass of the electron, 9.109e-31 kg. k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So let's plug the numbers in.

Given L1=1.0 nm, L2=2.0 nm. So L1 = 1e-9 meters, L2=2e-9 meters.

So 1/L1² is (1e9)^-2 = (1e-9)^-2 = 1e18 m^-2.

Wait, let me calculate each term separately.

Compute each term: 1/(L1^2) = 1/( (1e-9)^2 ) = 1e18 m^-2.

Similarly, 1/(L2^2) = 1/( (2e-9)^2 )= 1/(4e-18 m²) )= 0.25e18 m^-2.

So summing them: 1e18 + 0.25e18 = 1.25e18 m^-2.

So E0 = (h²/(8 m)) * 1.25e18 m^-2.

Wait, but h²/(8 m) has units of J·m².

Wait, let me compute h squared:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

So,

(h²) / (8 m) = (4.39e-67 J² s²) / (8 * 9.109e-31 kg )

Compute denominator: 8 *9.109e-31 = approx 7.287e-30.

So (4.39e-67 ) / (7.287e-30) ) = approx 6.02e-38 J·m².

Wait, because (J s)^2 / kg = (J² s²)/kg.

J is kg m²/s², so J² is kg² m^4/s^4.

(J² s²)/kg = (kg² m^4/s^4 * s²) ) / kg = kg m^4 / s^2.

Hmm, not sure if I'm getting the units right. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expression numerically.

So (h²/(8 m)) is ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (8 * 9.109e-31) )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 squared is approximately (6.626)^2=43.90, so 43.90e-68.

Denominator: 8 * 9.109e-31 is 72.872e-31 = 7.2872e-30.

So (43.90e-68) / (7.2872e-30) ) = (43.90 /7.2872) ) * 1e-38.

43.90 /7.2872 ≈ 6.02 → 6.02e-38.

So h²/(8 m) ≈ 6.02e-38 J·m².

Now multiply by 1.25e18 m^-2.

E0 = (6.02e-38 J·m²) * 1.25e18 m^-2 ) = 6.02e-38 * 1.25e18 = 6.02 *1.25 = 7.525, and exponents: e-38+18 = e-20.

So E0 ≈ 7.525e-20 J.

Now set this equal to kT.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So T = E0 / (k) = 7.525e-20 / 1.38e-23 = let's compute that.

7.525e-20 / 1.38e-23 = (7.525 / 1.38) * 1e3.

Compute 7.525 /1.38: let's see. 1.38 *5=6.9, 7.525-6.9=0.625. 1.38*0.45=0.621. So 5.45 approximately.

So 5.45 *1e3 → 5450 K.

Wait, but wait, the options: the choices are all around 3e3 to 1e4 K.

Wait, but my calculation came up with about 5450 K. Hmm, but looking at the options, option E is 1.2e4 K (12,000) and option H is 1.5e4 (15,000), and option I is 8e3 (8,000), etc.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

E0 = (h²/(8m)) (1/(L1^2) + 1/(L2^2)).

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 (J s)^2.

8m = 8 * 9.109e-31 kg ≈ 7.287e-30 kg.

So h²/(8m) = 4.39e-67 / 7.287e-30 ≈ 6.02e-38 J m².

Then, 1/(L1^2) is 1/( (1.0e-9)^2 ) = 1/(1e-18) )= 1e18 m^-2.

1/(L2^2) = 1/(4e-18) )= 0.25e18 m^-2.

Sum is 1.25e18 m^-2.

So E0 is (6.02e-38 J m²) * 1.25e18 m^-2 = 6.02e-38 *1.25e18 = (6.02 *1.25) e ( -38+18 ) = 7.525e-20 J.

Then, T = E0/(k) = 7.525e-20 / (1.38e-23) = (7.525 /1.38 ) * 1e3.

7.525 / 1.38 = Let's compute.

1.38 *5=6.9.

7.525-6.9=0.625.

1.38 *0.45 = 0.621.

So 5.45 gives 0.621. So 5.45 + 0.0045 would be 5.4545, but perhaps better to compute 0.625 /1.38.

Well, 1.38 * 0.455 is approximately 0.627 (since 0.45*1.38=0.621, 0.005 *1.38=0.0069 → 0.6279).

So 0.625 is about 0.455.

So 5.4545 would be around 5.45.

So 5.45 * 1e3 is 5450 K.

But wait, the options don't have 5.5e3 K. The options are A:2e2, B:5.5e3, C:2.5e3, D:7e3, E:1.2e4, F:6.5e3, G:9.5e3, H:1.5e4, I:8e3, J:3e3.

So option B is 5.5e3. But my calculation says 5450, which is 5.45e3.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: maybe the zero-point energy is (h²/(8m))(1/(L1^2) + 1/(L2^2)) ) ) * 1/2? Because sometimes, for a two-dimensional box, the ground state is (1,1), but maybe sometimes people consider average or something else. Wait, no, the ground state is the lowest energy, which is (1,1). So 1/2 factor is not in play here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of E0.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (h²/(8 m)) ( (n_x^2 + n_y^2) ) ) / (L_x^2 L_y^2 ). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the 1/(L_x^2 L_y^2) would be 1/(L_x^2 L_y^2), but in the energy formula, it's (n_x^2 + n_y^2) times (h²/(8 m L_x^2 L_y^2) ). So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the units are off. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute h²/(8m) as (6.626e-34)^2/(8 * 9.109e-31) )

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

h² = (6.626 x 1e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 = 43.90, so 43.90e-68 (J s)^2.

8m = 8 * 9.109e-31 kg = 72.872e-31 kg.

So h²/(8 m) = 43.90e-68 / 72.872e-31 = (43.90 /72.872) ) * 1e-37.

43.90 /72.872 ≈ 0.602 → 0.602e-37 → 6.02e-38 J m².

So E0 = 6.02e-38 * (1/(1e-9)^2 + 1/(2e-9)^2 ) = 6.02e-38 * (1e18 + 0.25e18 ) = 6.02e-38 * 1.25e18 = 7.525e-20 J.

So T = 7.525e-20 / 1.38e-23 = (7.525 /1.38 ) *1e3.

Compute 7.525 / 1.38.

1.38 *5 =6.9 → remainder 0.625.

1.38 *0.45=0.621 → 0.625-0.621=0.004. So 5.45 gives 0.621, which is 0.004 less than 0.625.

So 0.45 → 0.4545 would give 1.38 * 0.4545 ≈ 0.625.

So 5.4545 → 5.4545 *1e3 → 5454.5 K.

Hmm, but none of the options are 5.5e3 K. Looking back at the options, option B is 5.5e3 K, option D is 7e3, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h²/(8m). Let me recompute it more accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

h squared = (6.62607015e-34)^2 = Let me compute it step by step.

(6.62607015)^2 = 43.905 (approximate). So h²=43.905e-68 (J² s²).

8m = 8 * 9.10938356e-31 kg = 72.875e-31 kg.

So h²/(8m) = (43.905e-68) / (72.875e-31) ) = (43.905 /72.875) ) * 1e-37.

43.905 /72.875 ≈ 0.602. So 0.602e-37 = 6.02e-38.

So E0 = (6.02e-38) * (1.25e18) = 7.525e-20 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Maybe using the formula for the thermal energy as E = (k T) = (h²/(8 m L^2)) (1 + 1/L^2) ), but perhaps I was mistaken about the formula.

Wait, maybe for a particle in a 2D box, the energy is (n_x^2 + n_y^2) * (h²/(8 m L_x L_y)) ) ), but wait, no, that can't be right because the denominator would have L_x * L_y, but in the energy formula, L_x and L_y are denominators.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is E = (h²/(8 m)) ( (1/L1^2 + 1/L2^2) ) ), which is what I did earlier.

Hmm, so nothing seems wrong with the calculation.

But according to the calculation, T is approximately 5450 K, which is about 5.45e3 K.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.5e3 K, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B:5.5e3 K.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for a particle in a box in one dimension as E = (n² h²)/(8 m L^2), and in two dimensions, the energy is (n_x² + n_y²) * (h²/(8 m L^2)).

Wait, that's the same as what I did earlier.

Hmm, so I think the calculation is correct and the answer is option B.

Wait, but wait, the options given in the question are:

A: 2.0e2 K  
B:5.5e3 K  
C:2.5e3 K  
D:7.0e3 K  
E:1.2e4 K  
F:6.5e3 K  
G:9.5e3 K  
H:1.5e4 K  
I:8.0e3 K  
J:3.0e3 K  

So option B is 5.5e3 K, which is about 5500 K, which is close to 5450 K.

So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, why did the problem have thermal energy as kT and zero-point energy? Because in the question, the thermal energy is given, and we need to set them equal.

So yes, the calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the zero-point energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is E = (h²/(8 m)) * ( (n_x² + n_y²) ) / ( L_x L_y ) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that can't be because h²/(8m) has units of J·m², and (n_x² + n_y²) is unitless, so the denominator must be unitless, but Lx and Ly are in meters. So that would imply (n_x² + n_y²) / (Lx Ly) ), which is unitless, which would make the entire expression unitless.

But in our initial approach, the zero-point energy is given by (h²/(8m)) (1/L1² + 1/L2² ), which is (units of J m^2) * (1/m^2) ), which gives J, correct.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes when the formula is written as (n_x^2 + n_y^2) * (h^2/(8 m L_x L_y )) ). That would be unitless, so E would have units of J, which is correct. But that would be the same as using the formula E = (h^2/(8 m)) (n_x^2 + n_y^2) / (L_x L_y ) ), which is the same as (h^2/(8 m)) * (n_x^2 + n_y^2) / (Lx Ly) ), which is same as (h^2/(8 m)) * (n_x^2 + n_y^2) / (Lx Ly) ), same as (h^2/(8 m)) * ( (n_x^2 + n_y^2) ) / ( Lx Ly ) ), which is same as (h^2/(8 m)) * (1/Lx^2 * (n_x^2) ) + 1/Ly^2 * (n_y^2) )).

Wait, perhaps we can model it as E = (h^2/(8 m)) * ( (1/Lx^2) n_x^2 + (1/Ly^2) n_y^2 ) ), which is same as (h^2/(8 m)) * (n_x^2 + n_y^2) * (1/Lx^2 + 1/Ly^2 )).

Wait, but that's same as the initial approach.

So in any case, the calculation seems correct, and the answer should be option B:5.5e3 K.
</think>

To determine how low the thermal energy of a nanostructured material must be for it to match the zero-point energy of a particle in a 2D box, we start by calculating the zero-point energy of the particle in the 2D box. The zero-point energy is given by:

\[
E_0 = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{1}{L_1^2} + \frac{1}{L_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the particle, and \( L_1, L_2 \) are the side lengths of the box.

### Given Values:
- \( L_1 = 1.0 \, \text{nm} = 1.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)
- \( L_2 = 2.0 \, \text{nm} = 2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{h^2}{8m} \)
\[
\frac{h^2}{8m} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31}} = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{7.287 \times 10^{-30}} = 6.02 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{J·m}^2.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{1}{L_1^2} + \frac{1}{L_2^2} \)
\[
\frac{1}{L_1^2} = \frac{1}{(1.0 \times 10^{-9})^2} = 1.0 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}, \quad
\frac{1}{L_2^2} = \frac{1}{(2.0 \times 10^{-9})^2} = 0.25 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}.
\]
\[
\frac{1}{L_1^2} + \frac{1}{L_2^2} = 1.0 \times 10^{18} + 0.25 \times 10^{18} = 1.25 \times 10^{18} \, \text{m}^{-2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( E_0 \)
\[
E_0 = \left( 6.02 \times 10^{-38} \right) \times \left( 1.25 \times 10^{18} \right) = 7.525 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert \( E_0 \) to Temperature \( T \)
The thermal energy is related to temperature by \( E_0 = kT \), where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Solving for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{E_0}{k} = \frac{7.525 \times 10^{-20}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} = \frac{7.525}{1.38} \times 10^3.
\]
\[
\frac{7.525}{1.38} \approx 5.45 \, \text{K}.
\]
\[
T \approx 5.45 \times 10^3 \, \text{K} = 5450 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The closest option to \( 5450 \, \text{K} \) is **Option B: \( 5.5 \times 10^3 \, \text{K} \)**.

### Final Answer:
The thermal energy of the nanostructured material must be approximately \( 5.5 \times 10^3 \, \text{K} \).  
ANSWER: B
