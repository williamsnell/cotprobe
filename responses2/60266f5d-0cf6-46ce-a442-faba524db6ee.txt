Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lightbulbs and blackbodies. Hmm, I remember that blackbodies radiate energy according to the blackbody radiation law, right? And the question is about finding the temperature of a tungsten filament such that the maximum wavelength of the emitted light is 550 nm. 

Wait, the question says it's a blackbody radiator, which makes sense because lightbulbs emit light as blackbody radiation. The key here is Wien's displacement law, I think. I remember that Wien's law relates the maximum wavelength of a blackbody's emission to its temperature. The formula is lambda_max * T = constant. Oh right, the constant is approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K. 

So the formula is lambda_max = (2.898e-3 m·K) / T, where T is the temperature in Kelvin. We're given lambda_max as 550 nm. Oh wait, nm is nanometers, so I need to convert that to meters. 550 nm is 550e-9 meters. 

So plugging the numbers into the formula: 550e-9 m = 2.898e-3 m·K / T. Solving for T, we rearrange it to T = 2.898e-3 / (550e-9). Let me compute that. 

Let me do the math. 2.898e-3 is 0.002898. 550e-9 is 5.5e-7 meters. So 0.002898 divided by 5.5e-7.

Calculating that: 0.002898 / 5.5e-7 = (2.898e-3) / (5.5e-7) = (2.898 /5.5) * (1e4) because 1e-3 / 1e-7 is 1e4. Let me compute 2.898 /5.5. 

Calculating 2.898 /5.5: 5.5 goes into 2.898 about 0.527 times because 5.5 * 0.527 is around 2.9035, which is close. Wait, let me do it more accurately. Let me compute 5.5 × 0.527 ≈ 2.9035. But 2.898 is a bit less. So maybe 0.527 is a little over. Let's see, 2.898 ÷ 5.5 = ?

Alternatively, 2.898 /5.5 = (2.898 * 2) / (5.5 * 2) )= 5.796 /11. Hmm, 11 times 0.527 is 5.797, which is just a tiny bit higher than 5.796. So 0.527 is the approximate value. So 0.527 * 1e4 (since 1e-3 / 1e-7 is 1e4) becomes 5270 K. 

Wait, but wait a second. 5270 K is about 5.27 ×1e3 K. Looking at the options, option B is 5300 K, which is close to that. Let me double-check my calculation because sometimes I make arithmetic errors.

Wait, 2.898e-3 m·K divided by 550e-9 m equals T. So 2.898e-3 /550e-9 = (2.898/550) × (1e6) because 1e-3/1e-9 is 1e6. Let me compute 2.898 divided by 550.

2.898 ÷ 550 = 0.00527. Because 550 * 0.00527 = 2.8985. So 0.00527 multiplied by 1e6 gives 5270 K. So that's 5270 K, which is approximately 5300 K when rounded. 

So the correct option is B: 5300 K.

To determine the temperature of the tungsten filament such that the maximum wavelength of emitted light is 550 nm, we use Wien's displacement law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \cdot T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K}}{1}
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = 550 \, \text{nm} = 550 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\). Rearranging the formula to solve for \(T\):

\[
T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K}}{\lambda_{\text{max}}}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = 550 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\):

\[
T = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{550 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

Simplify the calculation:

\[
T = \frac{2.898}{550} \times 10^{6} \, \text{K}
\]

\[
T \approx 0.00527 \times 10^{6} \, \text{K} = 5270 \, \text{K}
\]

This value is approximately 5300 K when rounded to the nearest whole number. Comparing this result to the options provided:

- **A: 4500 K** — Too low.
- **B: 5300 K** — Matches the calculated value.
- **C: 4800 K** — Too low.
- **D: 6000 K** — Too high.

Thus, the correct answer is **B: 5300 K**.
