Okay, so there's this multiple-choice question about the Box-Jenkins approach to diagnostic testing for ARMA models. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question asks which statements are true. Let's look at each statement one by one.

Statement (i): "The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small." Hmm, I remember that Box-Jenkins models involve model identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking. Model identification tries to find the right model structure. So, if the model is too large (overfit), the residual autocorrelations might not be significant. If it's too small (underfitting), maybe the residuals show significant autocorrelations. So, the tests do assess whether the model is too large or too small. So statement (i) is true.

Statement (ii): "The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality." Oh right, the Box-Jenkins approach includes several diagnostic tests. Autocorrelation is a common one, especially for the residuals. Heteroscedasticity is checked using tests like the Ljung-Box test, which looks for any significant autocorrelation in the residuals. Non-normality is usually checked with something like the Shapiro-Wilk test, but sometimes people use the chi-squared test if the data meets certain criteria. So statement (ii) is correct.

Statement (iii): "If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure." I think this refers to the model's residuals being white noise. So if the model is correctly identified, the residuals should have no autocorrelation (no acf significant) and no partial autocorrelation (no pacf significant). So yes, this statement is true.

Statement (iv): "If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant." Wait, what's overfitting here? Oh, maybe in the context of ARMA model identification, overfitting refers to having a model that's too complex, including too many variables. So if the model is overfitted, the additional variables might not contribute significantly. So when you're trying to identify the correct model, if you have overfitting, the extra variables may have insignificant coefficients. So statement (iv) sounds correct.

Now, let's go through the options. The options are combinations of these statements. I need to see which options include all the correct statements.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (iii) and (iv) only → includes (iii) and (iv). But do all three statements (i, ii, iii, iv) hold?

Option B: (i) and (iii) only → includes (i) and (iii). But what about (ii) and (iv)?

Option C: (i), (iii), and (iv) → All three correct? Or is (ii) correct?

Option D: (i), (ii), (iii) → Includes (i), (ii), (iii). What about (iv)?

Option E: (ii) and (iii) only → (ii) is correct, (iii) is correct. Missing (i) and (iv).

Option F: (i) and (iv) only → (i) is correct, (iv) correct. Missing (ii) and (iii).

Option G: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) → All four correct. Do all four statements hold?

Option H: (ii) and (iv) only → (ii) correct, (iv) correct. Missing (i) and (iii).

Option I: (ii), (iii), (iv) only → (ii) correct, (iii) correct, (iv) correct. But (i) is incorrect?

Option J: (i) and (ii) only → (i) correct, (ii) correct. Missing (iii) and (iv).

Wait, now I need to check if (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are all correct.

Wait, earlier I thought (i) is correct. Let me recheck:

(i): The tests show whether the model is too large or too small. For Box Jenkins, after model identification, the residuals are checked for lack of autocorrelation. So if the model is correctly identified, the residuals don't show significant autocorrelation, so the model is appropriate. But if the model is too small, you might not see significant autocorrelations in the residuals. So the tests do show whether the model is too large or small. So (i) is correct.

So statements (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) are all correct.

Wait, let me think again about statement (iv). The question says "the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant." So under overfitting, the model includes too many variables, so the insignificant coefficients make sense. So (iv) is correct.

So all four statements (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) are correct. So the correct option would be G.

Wait, let me make sure. The original question was whether the statements are correct. So each is correct.

So the correct option is G: (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) all true.

But wait, looking at the options, the options present combinations. So each option is a combination of statements. So the option G includes all four, which are all correct.

So the correct answer is option G. Wait, but I should check the options again.

Wait, no. Let's recheck. The four statements:

(i) True.

(ii) True.

(iii) True.

(iv) True.

So the correct option is G: all four statements are correct.

Looking at the options, option G is labeled as (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) only. So the correct answer is G.

The question asks which statements are true concerning the Box-Jenkins approach to diagnostic testing for ARMA models. Each statement is evaluated as follows:

1. **Statement (i):** "The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small."  
   This is correct. Box-Jenkins models involve model identification, and diagnostic tests (e.g., autocorrelation) help determine if the model is appropriate by checking residuals for significance.

2. **Statement (ii):** "The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality."  
   This is correct. Standard diagnostic tests include autocorrelation (Ljung-Box), heteroscedasticity (test for significant autocorrelation in squared residuals), and normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test).

3. **Statement (iii):** "If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure."  
   This is correct. Residuals should be white noise, meaning no significant autocorrelation (ACF) or partial autocorrelation (PACF) in the residuals.

4. **Statement (iv):** "If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant."  
   This is correct. Overfitting leads to insignificant coefficients, as the model captures noise rather than signal.

All four statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are true. The correct option is the one that includes all four statements, which is **G: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) only**.
