Okay, so I have this question here about rounding gallons of gas sold to the nearest hundredth. Hmm, let me think. So the gas station sold 300.5849 gallons in a day. The question is asking me to round this to the nearest hundredth. 

Wait, what does that mean exactly? Well, the hundredth place is the second digit after the decimal point. So in 300.5849, the first digit after is 5, second is 8, third is 4, and the fourth is 9. Rounding to the nearest hundredth would look at the thousandth place, which is 4 here.

Wait a second, let's clarify. The number is 300.5849. So breaking it down:

300 is the whole number part.

0.5849 is the decimal part. So the first digit after the decimal is 5 (tenths place), second is 8 (hundredths), third is 4 (thousandths), and fourth is 9 (ten-thousandths).

When rounding to the nearest hundredth, I look at the thousandth place (the third digit after the decimal). In this case, it's 4. Since 4 is less than 5, I round down, meaning the hundredth place stays the same.

So the hundredth place is 8, and since the next digit is 4, which is less than 5, I don't round up. So the number becomes 300.58. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 300.58, and option F is 300.60. Or wait, no, let me check again.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The thousandth digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we don't round up the hundredth digit. So the number would be 300.58. But wait, looking at the options, option D is 300.58, and option F is 300.60.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 300.5849 is very close to 300.585, which would round up to 300.59. But according to the rules, if the next digit is less than 5, we don't round up. So the correct rounded value should be 300.58.

But wait, looking at the options again. Option D is 300.58, which matches. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure. 300.5849 is the exact value. When rounding to two decimal places (hundredths), the third decimal is 4, which is less than 5. So the hundredth place remains as is. So 300.58.

But option F is 300.60. That's 300.60, which is different. So why is that? Because 0.60 is more than 0.58, but if the number is 300.5849, which is over 300.585, but wait, 0.585 is 300.585. But wait, the actual number is 0.5849. So 0.5849 is less than 0.585, so when rounded to two decimal places, it's 0.58. Because 0.5849 is closer to 0.58 than to 0.59. So 300.58 is correct.

So the correct answer is D: 300.58.

The correct answer is D: 300.58.

To determine the correct rounding, look at the third decimal place (4) in 300.5849. Since it is less than 5, the second decimal place (8) remains unchanged. Therefore, the rounded value is 300.58.

Answer: D: 300.58
