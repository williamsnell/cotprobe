Question:

The Dickenson Company has purchased a hand-operated machine of the following description; after a year, it can purchase an automatic machine of equal capacity and sell the first machine for $1,600. The following data is available: Hand-Operated Machine Automatic Machine Purchase price $4,400 $6,200 Expected Useful life 5 years 4 years Expected salvage value $0 $0 Annual operating costs $2,600 $800 The current interest rate is 8%. Which of the following options should the company chose? Option A - Keep the hand-operated machine 5 years. Option B - Keep the hand-operated machine 1 year, sell it, and purchase the automatic to use for 4 years. Round all calculations to the nearest dollar.

Options:

A: Neither options
B: Keep the hand-operated machine for 4 years, then switch to the automatic machine for 1 year
C: Purchase the automatic machine immediately without selling the hand-operated machine
D: Option B
E: Keep the hand-operated machine for 3 years, then switch to the automatic machine for 2 years
F: Keep the hand-operated machine for 2 years, then switch to the automatic machine for the remaining 3 years
G: Option A, but negotiate a higher salvage value for the hand-operated machine after 5 years
H: Option B, but seek a lower purchase price for the automatic machine

Okay, so I have this problem about Dickenson Company deciding whether to keep their hand-operated machine or switch to an automatic one after a year. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the hand-operated machine costs $4,400 and has a 5-year useful life with no salvage value. The annual operating cost is $2,600. The automatic machine is more expensive, $6,200, with a 4-year life and no salvage value. The annual operating cost is much lower at $800. The interest rate is 8%, but I don't think I need to calculate the interest for this; I'll focus on the cash flows.

The company can choose between two options after a year. Option A is to keep the hand machine for 5 years. Option B is to keep it for 1 year, sell it, then buy the automatic for 4 years. The question is which option is better.

So, I need to calculate the equivalent annual cost (EAC) for both options and see which is lower. The EAC would tell me the annual cost over the machine's life if it's kept or sold. The lower EAC would be better.

First, let's calculate the EAC for the hand machine. The hand machine costs $4,400, has 5 years, no salvage. Annual operating cost is $2,600. The formula for EAC is (Initial cost * i) / PVIFA(i, n) + annual costs.

Wait, but wait. The EAC formula is (Initial Cost + annual operating costs * PVIFA) / PVIFA. Or, alternatively, it's the present value of all costs divided by the present value factor for the annuity. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can compute the net present value (NPV) of the costs and then divide by the present value factor of the annuity for the respective life.

So for the hand machine:

Initial cost: $4,400
Annual operating cost: $2,600 per year for 5 years
Salvage value: $0
Interest rate: 8% (so discount factor is (1 + 0.08)^-n)

Let me compute the present value of the operating costs. PV = 2600 * [1 - (1.08)^-5] / 0.08.

Calculating that:

1.08^5 is approximately 1.4693. So (1 - 1/1.4693) = 1 - 0.6806 = 0.3194. 0.3194 / 0.08 = 3.9925. So PV = 2600 * 3.9925 ≈ 10,380.5.

Then, the initial cost is $4,400. So the total present value is 4,400 + 10,380.5 ≈ $14,780.5. Now, the present value of the annuity factor for 5 years at 8% is 3.9927. So EAC = 14,780.5 / 3.9927 ≈ around $3,699.33. So the EAC for the hand machine is about $3,699.

Wait wait, but maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, the EAC can be calculated as (Initial cost + annual costs * PVIFA) / PVIFA. So:

EAC = (4400 + (2600 * PVIFA(8%,5))) / PVIFA(8%,5)

So PVIFA is 3.9927, as before. So numerator is 4400 + 2600 *3.9927 ≈4400 + 10,381 ≈14,781; divided by 3.9927 gives about 3,699. So EAC is approximately $3,699.

Now the automatic machine: $6,200, 4 years, no salvage. Annual operating cost $800.

Compute EAC for automatic.

Initial cost:6200

Annual cost:800

PVIFA for 4 years at 8% is (1 - 1/1.3605)/0.08 = (0.3605)/0.08 ≈4.5056

So PV of operating costs: 800 *4.5056 ≈3,604.48

Total PV of costs:6,200 +3,604.48=9,804.48

EAC = 9,804.48 /4.5056 ≈2,175.32.

So the EAC for the automatic is about $2,175.

So, if Dickenson keeps the hand machine, the EAC is ~$3,699. If they switch to automatic, it's ~$2,175. So automatically, the automatic is better.

But wait, the options are about whether to keep it for 5 years, or 1 year then switch.

So for option B: keep for 1 year, then buy the automatic for 4 years.

Let me compute the EAC for this scenario.

First year: Keep hand machine.

Costs for first year: Initial cost is $4,400, but you only keep it for one year. So the cost is $4,400, and then the annual cost is $2,600.

After one year, sell it. Gain from selling: perhaps the value of the machine. But wait, what's the salvage value? Hand machine's salvage is zero, but perhaps when sold, the proceeds are considered as the payment.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the net present value of selling, then investing in the automatic.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total cost for option B.

After year 1, Dickenson sells the hand machine. The book value at year 1 would be (since it's a straight-line? Or maybe they sold it at the cost? Hmm, perhaps the question assumes that the hand machine can be sold for its original cost, but that's not possible. Wait, no, the hand machine is now being sold, so the sale price would be based on its value at that time. But without knowing the market value, perhaps the problem assumes that the sale is for the book value or some other assumption. Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require that and just assumes that after one year, Dickenson can sell the machine for its book value, which is the purchase price.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the net present value of all options, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the equivalent annual cost for each option.

But the question is whether to keep for 1 year, sell, then buy the automatic for 4 years.

So for option B, Dickenson:

Year 1: Keep hand machine, pay $4,400, annual cost $2,600.

Then, in year 2-5: purchase automatic for 4 years.

But wait, the problem says after a year, Dickenson can purchase the automatic. So perhaps the first year is the initial purchase of the automatic? Or is the initial purchase the hand machine, and after one year, they can switch.

I think the key is that after 1 year, they can buy the automatic for 4 years. So the total time period considered is 1 year of hand machine, then 4 years of automatic.

Wait, but the options might be whether to keep the hand machine for 1 year, sell, and then use the automatic for 4 years. So Dickenson would not own the automatic machine beyond the first year, but uses it for four years.

So for option B, Dickenson:

Year 1: Keep hand machine, pay $4,400. Then, in year 1, also have operating costs of $2,600.

Then, in years 2-5, Dickenson buys the automatic, which costs $6,200 each year, with annual operating cost $800.

So to compute the equivalent annual cost for this option.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total cost and then find the EAC.

Option B's total cost:

Year 1: $4,400 (machine) + $2,600 (operating) = $7,000.

Years 2-5: Each year, buy the automatic for $6,200 and pay $800 in operating cost.

So in years 2-5, Dickenson's expenses are $6,200 + $800 = $7,000 each year.

So total cost over 5 years (1 year of hand, 4 years of automatic):

Year 1: $7,000

Years 2-5: 4 years * $7,000 = $28,000

Total: $7,000 + $28,000 = $35,000.

But this is just the total cost. The EAC would be the present value of all costs divided by the present value annuity factor for 5 years.

The present value of the $35,000 is:

$7,000 (year 1) + 4 * $7,000 (years 2-5) = $7,000 + $28,000 = $35,000.

The present value of $35,000 at 8% for 5 years.

PV = 35,000 * (1 - (1.08)^-5) /0.08

(1.08)^-5 = 0.680583. So 1 - 0.680583 = 0.319417.

Divide by 0.08: 0.319417/0.08 ≈ 3.9927.

So PV = 35,000 * 3.9927 ≈ 139,744.5.

Now, the present value of an annuity for 5 years is 3.9927. So EAC is 139,744.5 /3.9927 ≈ 3,498. But wait, that can't be right because the EAC of the automatic machine was about $2,175. So this EAC is higher than the automatic's. So if Dickenson chooses option B, their EAC is higher than keeping the automatic. So option B is not better; Dickenson should switch to the automatic.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, the EAC for option B is the EAC of the entire 5-year period. So the total cost is $35,000, spread over 5 years. So EAC is 35,000 / PVIFA(5,8%) = 35,000 /3.9927 ≈ 8,765. That can't be right because the automatic's EAC is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me compute the EAC for each option's 5-year period.

Wait, the question is about the five-year life for the automatic machine, but the hand machine's life is 5 years. So for the hand machine, after 5 years, it has zero salvage value.

So the EAC for the hand machine (5 years) is $3,699 as before.

The EAC for the automatic (4 years) is $2,175.

So, if Dickenson keeps the hand machine for five years, the EAC is $3,699. If they switch to the automatic, the EAC for the five-year period would be $2,175. So the automatic is better, so Dickenson should switch, which would make option B (keep for 1 year, switch for 4) not better than keeping the automatic for 5 years.

Wait, but the problem is about the cost of the two options. So if Dickenson chooses option B, their EAC is higher than keeping the automatic, so they would prefer to keep it as automatic.

But the answer options are about which option is better. So which option is better? The problem is whether to keep the hand for 5 years or switch to automatic for 4 years, or other options.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the options. Let me read the question again.

The question is about which option the company should choose. The options are:

Option A: Keep hand for 5 years.

Option B: Keep for 1 year, sell, then buy automatic for 4 years.

So which of these is better?

But the EAC for the hand is $3,699, for the automatic it's $2,175. So the automatic is better, so Dickenson should choose to keep the automatic for 4 years after buying it, thus not selling the hand machine. So the option that best serves Dickenson's interest is option B: keep for 1 year, then switch for 4.

Wait, but let me think about the alternatives again.

If Dickenson keeps the hand for 5 years, the EAC is $3,699. If they switch to the automatic for 4 years, the EAC is $2,175. So the automatic is better, so Dickenson should not keep the hand for 5 years but switch to the automatic.

But the options are about whether to keep the hand for 5 years (A) or to keep for 1 year, then switch (B). So which of these is better? Well, since the automatic's EAC is lower, the company should choose option B, which is to keep the hand for 1 year and then switch to automatic for 4 years, as that would result in a lower overall cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the five-year life but about the 4-year life of the automatic. So the problem is, if you switch to the automatic, it's a 4-year life. So Dickenson would only use it for 4 years after buying it, thus not using it for the initial year.

So, Dickenson would pay $4,400 for the hand machine, use it for 1 year, then buy the automatic for 4 years. So Dickenson's total cost over 5 years is:

Year 1: $4,400 (hand) + $2,600 (operating) = $7,000.

Years 2-5: $6,200 (automatic) + $800 (operating) = $7,000 each year.

So each year, Dickenson is paying $7,000 except in year 1, which is $7,000 as well. So total cost is $7,000 *5 = $35,000.

The EAC is the present value of $35,000 over 5 years divided by the present value annuity factor (3.9927). So as I calculated earlier, $35,000 *3.9927=139,744.5, divided by3.9927 gives $34,984. So EAC is about $3,498.

Wait, but the EAC for the automatic is $2,175. So Dickenson would prefer the EAC of the automatic. So option B is worse than keeping the automatic for 5 years. So which option is better? The problem is whether to keep the hand for 5 years or switch to automatic for 4 years, or other options.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the options. Let me reevaluate all the options.

The options are:

A: Keep the hand for 5 years.

B: Keep for 1 year, sell, then purchase automatic for 4 years.

C: Purchase automatic immediately (no selling) after 1 year.

D: Option B (keep 1, sell, buy 4).

E: Keep hand for 3, then switch to automatic for 2.

F: Keep hand for 2, then switch to automatic for 3.

G: Option A but higher salvage.

H: Option B with lower purchase price.

I: Option A.

J: Both options.

So, the options are about Dickenson's choice.

So, the EAC for the hand is $3,699, for the automatic is $2,175. So option B is keeping for 1 year, selling, then 4 years of automatic. The EAC of this option is $3,498, which is higher than the EAC of keeping the hand (3,699). So option B is worse than keeping the hand for 5 years.

So, the correct choice is A: keep the hand for 5 years.

But wait, let's think about whether selling the hand machine is beneficial. If Dickenson sells the hand machine for its book value, which is the purchase price, but that's assuming the machine is sold and the proceeds are considered as the payment.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the book value is the initial cost. So selling the hand machine (which had a 5-year life and no salvage) for its original cost of $4,400. So the sale would generate $4,400.

But then, Dickenson would have to consider the cost of that sale. So, the cost basis is $4,400. So for the first year, Dickenson:

- Pay $4,400 (hand machine), but then sell it for $4,400, so no cost.

- Also, pay $2,600 in operating costs.

So for the first year, total cost is $2,600.

Then, in years 2-5, Dickenson uses the automatic machine, which costs $6,200 per year, but Dickenson's cost basis is $4,400 (after selling the first year).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

Option B: Dickenson keeps the hand for 1 year, sells it, then uses the automatic for 4 years.

So the total cost is:

Year 1: Pay $4,400 (hand), sell for $4,400 (so no cost).

Plus $2,600 in operating.

So total for year 1: $2,600.

Years 2-5: Dickenson uses the automatic. The initial cost for the automatic is $6,200, but Dickenson already paid $4,400. So the net cost is $6,200 - $4,400 = $1,800 per year for 4 years.

Each year, Dickenson's cost is $1,800, plus $800 in operating, so total $2,600 per year.

So the total cost over 5 years is:

$2,600 (year 1) + 4*$2,600 (years 2-5) = $2,600 + $10,400 = $13,000.

Now, compute the present value of these costs.

Year 1: $2,600, PV = 2,600 / (1.08)^0 = 2,600

Years 2-5: each year's PV is 2,600 / (1.08)^n for n=1 to 4.

So sum of PV for these four years is 2,600 * [ (1/(1.08)) + (1/(1.08)^2) + (1/(1.08)^3) + (1/(1.08)^4) ) ].

This sum is 2,600 * [ (1 - (1/1.08)^4 ) / 0.08 ].

Again, (1/1.08)^4 is approximately 0.735, so (1 - 0.735) = 0.265. 0.265/0.08 = 3.3125.

So sum is 2,600 * 3.3125 ≈ 8,612.5.

Adding the first year's cost: 2,600 + 8,612.5 ≈ 11,212.5.

Now, find the present value of this amount over 5 years.

PV = 11,212.5 * [ (1 - (1.08)^-5 ) / 0.08 ] = 11,212.5 * 3.9927 ≈ 44,880.2.

Now, compute EAC: 44,880.2 / 3.9927 ≈ approximately 11,236.

Wait, that can't be right because the EAC of the automatic is lower. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps Dickenson's total costs are only the operating costs, but that's not the case. The machine's purchase price is $4,400, which is paid initially in the first year, but then sold for $4,400, so no cost. Then, Dickenson keeps the machine for the first year, pays $2,600 in operating, and sells it. Then, for the next four years, Dickenson uses the automatic machine, which costs $6,200 per year, but Dickenson already paid $4,400 (from selling the first year's machine). So the net cost for the automatic is $6,200 - $4,400 = $1,800 per year, plus $800 in operating. So each year, Dickenson's cost is $2,600.

So the total cost over five years is:

Year 1: $2,600

Years 2-5: 4 * $2,600 = $10,400

Total: $2,600 + $10,400 = $13,000.

So the present value of these costs is:

$2,600 (now) + 4 * [ $2,600 / (1.08)^n ].

Calculating each of the four years:

Year 2: $2,600 /1.08 ≈ 2,351.94

Year 3: 2,600 /1.08^2 ≈ 2,214.89

Year 4: 2,600 /1.08^3 ≈ 2,087.93

Year 5: 2,600 /1.08^4 ≈ 2,000.00

Adding these up:

2,351.94 + 2,214.89 = 4,566.83

+ 2,087.93 = 6,654.76

+ 2,000.00 = 8,654.76

Adding the first year's $2,600: 8,654.76 + 2,600 = 11,254.76.

Now, compute the EAC:

PV = 11,254.76

EAC = 11,254.76 / PVIFA(5,8%) = 11,254.76 /3.9927 ≈ 2,820.

Wait, that's higher than the EAC of the automatic machine, which was $2,175. So option B's EAC is higher than keeping the automatic for 5 years, so Dickenson would prefer to keep the automatic for 5 years.

So, which option is better? Option B is worse than keeping the automatic for 5 years. So the correct choice is A: keep hand for 5 years.

Wait, but let me think again. The automatic's EAC is $2,175, which is lower than the hand's EAC of $3,699. So Dickenson should choose the automatic.

So the correct option is A: keep hand for 5 years.

Wait, but the question also says that Dickenson can purchase the automatic machine after a year, meaning that Dickenson is considering whether to buy the automatic machine at year 2, but that's not the case in the options. The options suggest that Dickenson is considering whether to keep the hand machine for 5 years (option A) or to keep it for 1 year, sell, and then purchase the automatic for 4 years (option B), etc.

So, the correct answer is A: keep hand for 5 years.

But wait, the initial calculation said the EAC of the hand is $3,699, and the EAC of the automatic is $2,175. So Dickenson would prefer the automatic. So the correct option is A.

But the options presented are:

A: Keep hand for 5 years.

B: Keep for 1, sell, then automatic for 4.

C: Purchase automatic immediately.

D: Option B.

E: Keep hand for 3, then automatic for 2.

F: Keep hand for 2, then automatic for 3.

G: Option A but higher salvage.

H: Option B with lower purchase price.

I: Option A.

J: Both options.

So, according to the analysis, option B is worse than option A, so the correct answer is A.

But wait, the EAC of the option B is higher than the automatic's EAC, so Dickenson would prefer to keep the automatic for 5 years. So the correct answer is A.

But let me double-check the present value calculations.

Compute EAC for option B:

Year 1: $2,600

Years 2-5: $2,600 each year.

Total cost: $2,600 + 4*$2,600 = $13,000.

PV of $13,000 over 5 years at 8%:

PV = 13,000 * (1 - (1.08)^-5)/0.08

(1 - 0.680583)/0.08 = 0.319417 / 0.08 = 3.9927.

PV = 13,000 * 3.9927 ≈ 51,895.1.

EAC = 51,895.1 / 3.9927 ≈ 13,000.

Wait, that can't be correct. Wait, the EAC calculation is the present value divided by the present value of an annuity factor. So 51,895.1 / 3.9927 ≈ 12,991. So the EAC is about $12,991.

Wait, that can't be right. The EAC should be the annualized cost. I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, the present value of the costs is $51,895.1. The EAC is this PV divided by PVIFA(5,8%).

PVIFA(5,8%) is 3.9927.

So EAC = 51,895.1 /3.9927 ≈ 12,991.

Wait, that's even worse than the EAC of the automatic, which is $2,175. So option B's EAC is higher than the automatic's, so Dickenson would prefer to keep the automatic for 5 years, which is option A.

So, the correct answer is A: Keep hand for 5 years.
</think>

To determine the optimal decision for Dickenson, we calculate the Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) for both the hand machine and the automatic machine. The EAC is the present value of all costs, discounted to the present using the 8% interest rate, divided by the present value of an annuity factor for the given life and interest rate.

### **Hand Machine:**
- **Cost:** $4,400 (initial purchase, no salvage value).
- **Operating Cost:** $2,600 per year.
- **Life:** 5 years.

#### **EAC Calculation:**
1. **Total Cost:** $4,400 (initial cost) + $2,600/year for 5 years.
2. **Present Value (PV) of Costs:**
   - **Year 1:** $2,600
   - **Years 2-5:** $2,600/year for 4 years.
3. **PV of Costs:**
   - Year 1: $2,600.
   - Years 2-5: $2,600/year for 4 years. The present value is calculated as:
     \[
     2,600 \times \left( \frac{1 - (1.08)^{-4}}{0.08} \right) \approx 2,600 \times 3.9927 \approx 10,181.02
     \]
   - Total PV: $2,600 + $10,181.02 = $12,781.02.
4. **EAC:** 
   \[
   \frac{12,781.02}{3.9927} \approx 3,200.
   \]

### **Automatic Machine:**
- **Cost:** $6,200 (initial cost, no salvage value).
- **Operating Cost:** $800 per year.
- **Life:** 4 years.

#### **EAC Calculation:**
1. **Total Cost:** $6,200 (initial cost) + $800/year for 4 years.
2. **Present Value (PV) of Costs:**
   - **Year 1:** $800
   - **Years 2-4:** $800/year for 3 years.
3. **PV of Costs:**
   - Year 1: $800.
   - Years 2-4: $800/year for 3 years. The present value is calculated as:
     \[
     800 \times \left( \frac{1 - (1.08)^{-3}}{0.08} \right) \approx 800 \times 2.577 = 2,061.60
     \]
   - Total PV: $800 + $2,061.60 = $2,861.60.
4. **EAC:** 
   \[
   \frac{2,861.60}{3.9927} \approx 7,163.
   \]

### **Decision:**
- The EAC for the hand machine is approximately $3,200, while the EAC for the automatic machine is approximately $7,163.
- Dickenson should choose the option with the lower EAC, which is keeping the hand machine for 5 years (Option A).

ANSWER: A
