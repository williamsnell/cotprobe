Okay, so I've got this question about ethical relativism and human rights. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my ethics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which of the given options is the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. The options are A through J, each representing different ethical theories.

Alright, first, what's ethical relativism? From what I remember, ethical relativism says that ethical statements are relative to the individual's beliefs. So, for example, if someone lives a life that'sologically better than another, they can say that their life is better, even if that's against the general ethical principles. It's like, "You're better off because you've done something you might have considered bad."

Now, the question is about the strongest argument against this view, specifically regarding human rights. I think the options include various ethical theories. Let's list them out and see which one fits.

Option A: Cognitivism. I'm not too sure about this one. Cognitivism is part of the broader logistic fallibilism, I believe. It suggests that knowledge is unreliable and that people should act based on what they know, not necessarily believing in any universal moral truths. So, if someone doesn't know what's right, they shouldn't hold them to moral responsibilities. That seems to support ethical relativism because it rejects absolute moral truths and instead relies on individual beliefs.

Option B: Social Contract Theory. This is another form of logisticism. The social contract theory holds that individuals agree to act in the best interest of the group for the benefit of society. So, they're not holding absolute moral obligations because they're subject to the collective's best interest. Again, this seems to align with ethical relativism because it emphasizes the collective's role rather than individual morality.

Option C: Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness or utility. The idea is that the best action is the one that maximizes well-being. However, this approach doesn't necessarily require absolute moral truths. It can be applied to different situations, and there's no inherent relativism here because it's about the consequences of actions, not personal beliefs. So, while it's a strong ethical theory, it's not the strongest argument against ethical relativism in this context.

Option D: Empiricism. Empiricism is the belief that knowledge is based on sensory experience, not innate beliefs. So, it's about practical ethics rather than universal moral truths. If we accept empiricism, ethical relativism might not hold because we'd think that our subjective experiences determine what's right. But I'm not sure if this is the strongest argument against ethical relativism.

Option E: Nihilism. This is the belief that suffering is inherent in humans and that the only moral action is to avoid suffering. So, if someone's life is bad, they should do something to improve it. Nihilism seems to support ethical relativism because it requires that all actions are moral in the sense that they prevent suffering. But wait, the question is about the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. So, if someone's life is morally equivalent to another's, they shouldn't have to make a difference. So if you're in a position to improve someone's situation, it's their right. That would be a strong argument against ethical relativism because it would require that all are held to moral responsibility for their own betterment.

Wait, but the question is which is the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. So, if you're against ethical relativism, you'd argue that you must hold yourself to moral responsibility for your own actions. If your actions are good for someone else, you should be held to account for your own actions. That would be the case under a deontological ethics or a harm principle. Deontological ethics says that an action is wrong if it leads to harm, regardless of what others are doing. So that's another aspect.

Looking at the options, option G is Rationalism, which is a form of logisticism. Rationalism is similar to logisticism, focusing on subjective knowledge and the importance of individual beliefs and experiences. So, if someone's actions are based on their personal beliefs, they might be held to moral responsibility. That would support their argument against ethical relativism.

Option F is Positivism, which is a form of logisticism but more about objective truths rather than human behavior. It's about believing that there are universal truths about the world, not human rights. So that's not directly about human rights and their obligations.

Option H is Communitarianism, which is similar to social contract theory. It emphasizes that individuals act for the benefit of the group. So, it supports ethical relativism because it allows for personal choice within a collective goal.

Option I is Existentialism, which is more about the individual's purpose and meaning in life. It's about living for one's own good, not for others. So, it's about individual morality and rights, not about collective or ethical relativism.

Option J is Deontological Ethics, which, as I mentioned, focuses on the consequences of actions. It holds that an action is wrong if it leads to harm, regardless of others. So, if someone's life is morally equivalent to another's, they shouldn't have to make a difference. This would be a strong argument against ethical relativism because ethical relativism would allow people to hold themselves to moral responsibility for their own actions, even if those actions are equivalent to others.

Wait, so the question is which is the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. Ethical relativism says that you can hold yourself to moral responsibility for your own actions. So, if you think your actions are right, you are still holding yourself to moral responsibility, which is the opposite of someone who holds others to responsibility.

So, the strongest argument would be one that says you have no obligation to hold others to moral responsibility if your actions are good for someone else. That would be the case under deontological ethics, which is a form of rationalism or logisticism.

Looking back, the options are C (utilitarian), E (nihilism), G (rationalism), and J (deontological ethics). The question is which is the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights.

Ethical relativism says that you shouldn't hold others to moral responsibility if your actions are good for someone else. So, the strongest argument would be that you must hold yourself to moral responsibility. That would be deontological ethics, which is a form of logisticism and rationalism.

So options G (rationalism) and J (deontological ethics) are both possible. But the question is about the strongest argument. Deontological ethics is a form of rationalism and logisticism. It's a strong ethical theory because it's about consequences and the harm caused.

Alternatively, the other option is E: Nihilism, which is a form of logisticism. It says that suffering is inherent and that the only moral action is to avoid suffering. So, if your life is suffering, you should act to improve it. That supports the idea that you have moral responsibility for your own actions, which would be a strong argument against ethical relativism.

Wait, but the question is about the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. So, ethical relativism says that you can't hold others to moral responsibility. So, the strongest argument would be that you must hold yourself to moral responsibility, which is deontological ethics (Option J) or rationalism (Option G).

Wait, but the question is about the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility towards human rights. So, the argument is that ethical relativism would require that you hold others to moral responsibility if your actions are good for others. The strongest argument would be that you have an obligation to hold yourself to moral responsibility, which is the deontological approach.

So, between J and G, J is deontological, and G is rationalism. Deontological is a strong ethical theory, so J would be the strongest argument for holding oneself to moral responsibility.

But wait, in the options, J is Deontological Ethics. So the answer would be J.

Wait, but let me check: the question is about the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. So, if ethical relativism says that you can't hold others to moral responsibility, then the strongest argument would be that you must hold yourself to moral responsibility, which is the deontological approach (J) or rationalism (G). Which is stronger? I think deontological is a strong ethical theory, so J would be the answer.

But another angle: the question is about the hostility to human rights. If someone is arguing against ethical relativism, they would probably say that they must hold themselves to moral responsibility for their own actions, regardless of others' actions. So, that's a strong argument against ethical relativism.

Wait, but the options are J (deontological) and G (rationalism). Which of these is the strongest against ethical relativism's stance?

Deontological ethics is a strong ethical theory because it focuses on consequences and the harm you cause. If you think your actions are good, you have to hold yourself to moral responsibility. That would be a strong argument against ethical relativism.

So, the correct answer is J: Deontological Ethics.
</think>

The question asks which argument is the strongest against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. Ethical relativism holds that one's obligations to others are neutral and that you can act as if your actions are morally irrelevant to others. The strongest argument against this stance is that you must hold yourself to moral responsibility for your own actions, regardless of others' well-being. This is best captured by deontological ethics, which emphasizes consequences and harm. 

**Answer:** J: Deontological Ethics
