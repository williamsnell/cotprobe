Question:

The geneticist Mary Lyon hypothesized the existence of structures visible just under the nuclear membrane in mammals, which were later named Barr bodies. Which of the following statement is NOT correct about Barr bodies?

Options:

A: In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome becomes inactivated in every body cell.
B: The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.
C: A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body.
D: Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA.

Okay, so I've got this question about Barr bodies and a geneticist named Mary Lyon. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking which statement is NOT correct about Barr bodies. The options are A to D. Let's go through each one.

First, what do I remember about Barr bodies? I think they're structures formed during cell division, specifically in mammals. They're named after their appearance, which is just under the nuclear membrane. The term 'Barr' comes from the name of a specific structure. Oh right, these structures are involved in the process of reprogramming cells, like in the formation of stem cells.

So, what's the process? I remember something about the S phase of the cell cycle when chromosomes might become inactive. During S phase, especially in the early embryo, the X chromosome in females (which is usually inactive) becomes active. These active X chromosomes form Barr bodies. So when a female cell divides, those X chromosomes in each cell become active, and they form these structures around the nucleus. So each new cell gets an active X chromosome and some Barr body, right?

Now let's look at each option.

Option A: In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome becomes inactivated in every body cell. Wait, wait—each body cell comes from a single cell, right? So if the X is inactivated, each cell would have one inactive X. But in mammals, females have two X chromosomes. So in the early embryo, each cell would have one X active and one inactive. So the statement says every body cell has one inactive X. That sounds correct because each cell has one X, but the X is inactive, so the statement is accurate. So A is correct, so it's not the wrong statement. So the wrong answer can't be A.

Option B: The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated. Wait, same chromosome — that's referring to the X chromosome. In early embryo, yes, each cell has one X. So B says in normal females, same (X) is inactive. So this is correct. So B is correct, so incorrect statement isn't B.

Option C: A male with XXY genotype will have one Barr body. Wait, XXY is a sex chromosome anomaly. In males, they have two X's and one Y. So XXY is a condition where one X is absent. But wait, in males, having one X and one Y. But I don't think XXY leads to Barr bodies. Because the Barr bodies are formed during the S phase, when the X is active. But in males, the X is not present in the same way. Oh wait, no. Wait, in males, each cell has one X and one Y. So during normal development, the X in females is present (but inactive) in somatic cells. Do males ever form Barr bodies? I think Barr bodies are more about female development. So in males, even if they have XXY, they don't have X active to form Barr bodies. So option C is incorrect because a male with XXY shouldn't have any Barr bodies. So C is the incorrect statement (the correct answer to the question). Or wait, the question is which is NOT correct. So if C is not correct, that's the answer.

Option D: Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA. I remember that DNA methylation is a key part of epigenetic regulation. In particular, when a region is methylated, especially in CpG islands, it can activate gene expression. I think that Barr bodies are associated with DNA methylation. So D is correct. So D is a correct statement, not the wrong one.

So putting it together: the incorrect statement is C. Because in males, XXY doesn't lead to any Barr bodies. So option C is the statement that's not correct, so the answer is C.

To determine which statement is NOT correct about Barr bodies, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: In the early female embryo, one copy of the X chromosome becomes inactivated in every body cell. This is correct because, during the early embryo, each body cell has one X chromosome, which is inactive. Therefore, this statement is accurate.

- **Option B**: The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated. This is also correct because, in normal females, each cell retains one X chromosome, which is inactivated. Thus, this statement is accurate.

- **Option C**: A male with the XXY genotype will have one Barr body. This is incorrect because Barr bodies are associated with female-specific development. In males, XXY genotype involves one X and one Y chromosome, and there is no evidence that this leads to the formation of Barr bodies. Therefore, this statement is NOT correct.

- **Option D**: Barr bodies consist of highly methylated DNA. This is correct because Barr bodies are linked to DNA methylation, which is a key mechanism in their formation. Thus, this statement is accurate.

The statement that is NOT correct is **Option C**.
