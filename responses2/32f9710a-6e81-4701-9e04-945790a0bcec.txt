Okay, so I've got this question about electric and magnetic fields, and I need to figure out which statement is false. The options are A through J. Let me try to think through each option step by step.

I remember that electric and magnetic fields interact in certain ways depending on the movement of charges. Let me recall the basic principles.

First, I think about the Lorentz force. The Lorentz force on a charge is given by F = q(E + v × B), where E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, v is the velocity of the charge, and q is the charge.

Option A: A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field.
Wait, does that make sense? If a positive charge moves in the direction of E, it would experience a force in that direction because F = qE. But if it's moving perpendicular to B, then the cross product v × B would be zero since v and B are perpendicular. So F would be qE. So A says the charge moves in E's direction and moves perpendicular to B. Oh, wait, no. If it's moving in E's direction, then velocity is in E. So F is qE. Oh, but the statement says the charge moves perpendicular to B. So if v is in the direction of E, and E is in the same direction as v, then v is parallel to E. So when the charge moves perpendicular to B, that's another thing.

Wait, the option says: positive charge moves in direction of E (so v is aligned with E), and moves perpendicular to B. So the force would be F = q(E + v × B). Since E and v are parallel, v × B would be zero because they're in the same direction. So F is qE. So in that case, it would experience the electric force. So this statement is true for that part. But wait, the option says "a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." So, does the charge's velocity being perpendicular to B?

Wait, option A says "a positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." Hmm, maybe the wording is a bit confusing. So, the first part is that the charge is moving in E's direction. The second part is that the charge is moving perpendicular to B. So, the second part is about the velocity being perpendicular to B. So if the velocity is perpendicular to B, then F is q(v × B), which would be qvB (since v and B are perpendicular, cross product magnitude is vB sin(theta)=vB), and direction is perpendicular to both. But that's about the direction of the force. Now, does such a charge experience a force? Yes, because if v is perpendicular to B, then F is non-zero (q times vB, which is a vector). So statement A says both scenarios happen. So that's true.

Option B: All charges experience a force in an electric field, but only moving charges can experience a force in a magnetic field.
Wait, that doesn't sound right. Electric fields exert forces on all charges, regardless of their motion. Magnetic fields also exert forces on all charges, regardless of motion. So option B is incorrect because it says only moving charges experience forces in a magnetic field. So B is the false statement? Maybe, but I'll check other options first.

Option C: All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field.
Wait, this is the opposite of option B. So if B is false, and C is claiming all charges feel forces in B, that's false. So if B is the false statement, which is what I'm thinking, then C is the correct false because C is saying all charges experience force in B, which is not true. So if the question is which is false, then C is the false one. Or wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, let me go through each option again.

Option B says that all charges experience a force in E field, but only moving charges experience a force in B. That's not correct because both E and B fields apply forces to all charges. So B is the false statement.

Option C says all charges experience a force in B, but only moving charges in E. Wait, that can't be right because E and B fields have their own forces regardless of the charge's motion. So option C is incorrect in both parts. So if the question is which is false, and B is wrong, then C is also wrong, but the question is looking for the false statement. So which one is the false statement? Because the question is which statement is false, so B is false because it's saying only moving charges experience force in B, which isn't true. So B is the false statement.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the answer options include C, and others might have their own issues. Let me make sure.

Let me go through each option:

A: Positive charge moving along E, moving perpendicular to B. So, E direction is along v, so F is qE. Moving perpendicular to B (so v × B is non-zero), so F would be q(v × B). So yes, both happen. So this statement is true.

B: All charges experience a force in E (which they do, all charges have their own F from E), but only moving charges experience a force in B (which is false because all charges experience F from B regardless of v). So B is incorrect.

C: All charges experience force in B. But since all charges experience F in B regardless of v, this is wrong. So C is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is which statement is FALSE. So the false statement is option B because it says only moving charges experience a force in B field. Because both fields affect all charges.

Wait, another way: option C says "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." So this is saying that all charges are affected by both fields, but only moving charges feel the electric field's force. But that's incorrect because all charges feel both fields regardless of their motion. So I think option C is also wrong.

Wait, but option B is the only one that's completely incorrect. Because option B says "only moving charges experience force in B field." Which is false because all charges experience force in B.

So, the false statements are B and C. But the question asks which is false. So the correct answer would have to be either B or C.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. The question is which of the options is FALSE. So if statement B is false, then it's the correct answer.

Wait, let me read each option again.

A: Positive charge moves in E direction; positive charge moves perpendicular to B.

The first part: positive charge moving along E, so F = qE. Second part: moving perpendicular to B. Then the cross product v × B is non-zero. So yes, the charge experiences a force from B. So statement A is true.

B: All charges experience force in E, but only moving charges experience force in B.

No, because both E and B fields apply forces to all charges. So the second part of B is incorrect. So the statement B is false.

C: All charges experience force in B, but only moving charges can experience force in E.

No, same as B. Both fields affect all charges, so C is incorrect.

Wait, so the question is which is FALSE. So the correct answer (the false statement) is option B.

Wait, another option: option C says "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." So this is incorrect because, for example, a stationary charge in B would experience a force (F = q v × B, but v is zero, so F=0). So a stationary charge in B field would not feel any force, but if a charge is moving in B, it would feel a force. So option C is incorrect because it says all charges experience force in B field, which is wrong.

Wait, but let me look at all options again.

Option D: A charge moving along the direction of E will experience a force, but a charge moving along the direction of B will not.

Wait, moving along E: F is qE, so yes, it experiences a force. Moving along B: v is parallel to B. So v × B is zero. So the force from B is zero. So the statement says that charge moving along B won't experience a force. So D's statement is correct.

Option E: All moving charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B.

No, the force is F = q(E + v × B). The direction depends on both E and v × B. So the force can have components in E, and others in B. So E's statement is incorrect because the force isn't parallel to E. It's in the direction of E plus the cross product.

Option F: A stationary charge can experience a force in B field.

No, a stationary charge (v=0) in B field experiences zero force. So F=0. So F is zero. So statement F is incorrect because a stationary charge cannot experience a force in B.

Option G: All stationary charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B.

Wait, a stationary charge (v=0) in E field has F = qE, which is a force in the direction of E. The statement says it's parallel to E, which is correct. In B field, F=0, so the force is zero, which can be considered as perpendicular to B (since F is zero, it's in any direction, but directionally, it's not perpendicular. But the statement says 'perpendicular to B', which is not correct. So G is incorrect because a stationary charge in B doesn't experience a force, so the force isn't perpendicular. So G is false.

Wait, but I thought option B was the false statement. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the question is which statement is false. So the false statements are B and C and G, perhaps. But I have to think about which is the correct option.

I think I need to go through each option again, perhaps in detail.

Let me go option by option.

Option A: A positive charge moves in E direction (so F = qE) and moves perpendicular to B (so v × B is non-zero, so F = q(v × B)). So both happen. So A is true.

Option B: All charges experience force in E (which is true) but only moving charges experience force in B (which is false because all charges do, regardless of v). So B's second part is incorrect, making B a false statement.

Option C: All charges experience force in B (which is incorrect, because all charges feel F in B regardless of v), but only moving charges can experience F in E (which would be incorrect because F in E is always present regardless of v). So C is incorrect.

Option D: Moving along E (so F = qE, correct). Moving along B: v × B is zero (so F=0, correct). So D says the charge experiences a force in E (correct) but not in B (correct). So D is correct.

Option E: All moving charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No, because the force could have components in both E and B directions. So E's statement is incorrect.

Option F: A stationary charge can experience a force in B → No, because for v=0, F=0. So F is zero in B field. So F is perpendicular to B? Wait, F is zero, which can be considered as in any direction, but directionally, it's nothing. So statement F says it's perpendicular to B. But zero vector has no direction. So statement F is incorrect.

Option G: All stationary charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No. Because a stationary charge in E experiences F parallel to E (correct). But in B, F is zero. So the statement says 'perpendicular to B' for the force. But the force is zero, so it's not perpendicular. Thus, G is false because the force isn't perpendicular to B. So G is a false statement.

So which statement is the false one? The question is which is the FALSE. So looking at all options, the statements that are false are B, C, G.

Wait, but the options are A to J, and I have to choose one. So let me see the options again.

Looking back, the question is "which of the following statements is FALSE".

So the options are A to J. Let me see:

Which of the following is false:

So the false statements are B, C, G, and perhaps another.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering option C.

Option C says: All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in E. So this is incorrect because all charges experience forces in E and B, regardless of their motion. So the statement in C is wrong because the first part is incorrect (all charges do experience forces in B, not only moving charges do. So option C is false.)

Wait, so both B and C are false? No, let's see:

Wait, option B's statement is "All charges experience a force in E, but only moving charges can experience a force in B." So the second part is incorrect because all do. So B is false.

Option C's statement is "All charges experience a force in B, but only moving charges can experience a force in E." So first part is incorrect because all do. Second part is incorrect because all do. So C is also false.

Wait, but the question is which is the false statement. So the false statement is any of B, C, G, etc. But we're to select one.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is to choose which statement is false. The options are A to J. So let's go through each option again.

Looking for the false statement.

Option B: All charges experience force in E, but only moving charges in B. No, because all experience in B. So B is wrong.

Option D: Moving along E (charge experiences F in E) and moving along B (charge experiences F=0). So D is correct.

Option E: All moving charges experience F parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No, because F has both components. So E is wrong.

Option F: Stationary charge in B → F=0. So F is zero, not a force along B. So F is not perpendicular. So statement F is wrong.

Option G: All stationary charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No, because a stationary charge in E experiences a force parallel to E. But in B, it's zero. So the statement says "perpendicular to B". But the force is zero, so it's not in any direction, let alone perpendicular. So G is wrong.

So the false statements are B, C, D, E, F, G.

Wait, but the question is which is false. So the false statement is any option that is incorrect.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate each option.

Option B: The second part is incorrect, so the statement is false.

Option C: The first part is incorrect. So the statement is false.

So both B and C are false. But the question is which one is the false statement. So which of the options (A-J) is false.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option C.

Option C: All charges experience a force in B, but only moving charges can experience a force in E. 

Wait, all charges experience force in B field. Which is incorrect because all charges do experience E and B fields regardless of their movement. So statement C is wrong.

But perhaps looking at the other options, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me think about other options.

Option F: A stationary charge can experience a force in B. No, because F=0. So F is zero, so it doesn't have a direction in B. So statement F is incorrect because the force isn't a force in B.

Option G: All stationary charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No, because a stationary charge has F parallel to E, and F is zero. So the statement says "perpendicular to B," which isn't correct. So G is false.

So the false statements are B, C, G. But the question is which is the false statement.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false, and I'm to choose only one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option C. Let me read option C again.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field."

Wait, does that mean that all charges feel a force from B, but only moving charges feel a force from E. That's correct, because all charges experience both fields. So option C is incorrect.

But wait, the question is about which statement is false, so any of these would be a false statement. But the problem is that the options are A to J, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the statements. Let me reevaluate all options.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct. Because all charges experience force in B, but only moving charges experience force in E. No, that can't be right because all charges experience both.

Wait, perhaps I misread option C. Let me read it again. Option C says: 'All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field.'

So, the first part is correct (all experience B). The second part: only moving charges (so v ≠0) can experience E. But E is always present. So the statement is incorrect because all charges can experience E.

So option C is incorrect.

So the false statements are B, C, G, and others.

Wait, let me think about option J. Option J says: A negative charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a negative charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field.

Wait, for electric field: F = qE. So if E is in the direction of v, F would be in the direction of v, which is correct. So a negative charge moving in direction of E would have F opposite to E. Wait, no: if E is in the direction of v, F is same as v. So if v is in E's direction, then F is in the direction of E, which is same as v.

Wait, but for a negative charge, F = qE. So if E is in the direction of v, then F is in the same direction as v. But for a negative charge, F would be opposite to E. Wait, no, F is qE. So if E is in the direction of v, F is in the same direction as E.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let me think of E as pointing along a certain direction. For a positive charge, F is in the direction of E. For a negative charge, F is opposite to E.

So, option J: negative charge moves in E's direction. So F is opposite to E. So for example, if E is to the right, F is to the left. So the statement is correct.

Another part of option J: negative charge moves perpendicular to B. So the velocity is perpendicular to B. So the Lorentz force would be q(v × B). Since v is perpendicular to B, v × B is in a direction perpendicular to both. So F is perpendicular to B. So the statement is correct.

So option J's statement is correct.

Now, going back to the initial question, the problem is to select the false statement from the options A-J.

So, options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Let me reevaluate each option.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of each option once again.

Option A: Positive charge in E's direction, so F = qE. Moving perpendicular to B, F = q(v × B). So both happen, so statement A is correct.

Option B: All charges experience force in E (correct). But only moving charges can experience in B (incorrect, because all do). So statement B is false.

Option C: All charges experience F in B (correct). Only moving charges can experience F in E (incorrect, because all do). So statement C is false.

Option D: Positive charge along E, F = qE. Along B, v × B is non-zero (so F = q(v × B)). So D is correct.

Option E: All moving charges experience F parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No, because the force can have components in both. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Stationary charge in B: F=0, so statement F is incorrect.

Option G: All stationary charges experience F parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No, because F=0, so it's not perpendicular. G is incorrect.

Option H: Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should stop and look at the initial problem again. The question is, which of the following statements is false. So among the options A to J, which one is the false statement.

So, after considering each option, I think the false statement is option B or C.

But perhaps I should re-express each option correctly.

Alright, let's go through each option again:

Option A: Positive charge moves along E's direction, so F = qE. Then it moves perpendicular to B's direction, so F would be q(v × B) which is non-zero. So A is correct.

Option B: All charges experience a force in E field. True. Now, the statement says "but only moving charges can experience a force in B field." So the second part is incorrect because all charges experience force in B field. So B is the false statement.

Option C: All charges experience a force in B field. No, because all experience F in E as well. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Positive charge moves along E's direction (F = qE) and moves along B's direction (so v = B's direction, F = 0). So statement D is correct.

Option E: All moving charges experience F parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No. F can have components in both. So E is false.

Option F: Stationary charge in B field. F=0, so statement F is incorrect.

Option G: All stationary charges experience F parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No, because F=0 and isn't perpendicular. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Not applicable, but the options are A-J.

So, the false statements are B, C, F, G, H, etc. But the question is about which is the false statement among the given options.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option B.

In that case, the false statement is option B.

So, the answer should be option B.
</think>

To determine which statement is false, let us analyze each option systematically:

### Option A:
A positive charge moves in the direction of the electric field, experiencing a force \( F = qE \). If it moves perpendicular to the magnetic field, the force is \( F = q(v \times B) \), which is non-zero. Thus, this statement is true.

---

### Option B:
This statement claims that all charges experience a force in the electric field but only moving charges experience a force in the magnetic field. The second part is false because all charges experience forces in the magnetic field regardless of their motion. Therefore, this statement is false.

---

### Option C:
This statement claims that all charges experience a force in the magnetic field but only moving charges experience a force in the electric field. Both parts are false because all charges experience forces in both fields regardless of their motion. Thus, this statement is false.

---

### Option D:
This statement claims that a charge moving along the direction of the electric field experiences a force, and a charge moving along the direction of the magnetic field experiences no force. This is correct because moving along the magnetic field results in \( v \times B = 0 \), so the force is zero. Thus, this statement is true.

---

### Option E:
This statement claims that all moving charges experience a force parallel to the electric field and perpendicular to the magnetic field. This is false because the force can have components in both fields, not necessarily parallel or perpendicular. Thus, this statement is false.

---

### Option F:
This statement claims that a stationary charge can experience a force in the magnetic field. However, a stationary charge experiences no force because \( F = qvB = 0 \). Thus, this statement is false.

---

### Option G:
This statement claims that all stationary charges experience a force parallel to the electric field and perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, a stationary charge experiences no force because \( F = 0 \). Thus, this statement is false.

---

### Option H:
This option is not applicable since the question only asks about options A to J.

---

### Conclusion:
The false statements are **B**, **C**, **E**, **F**, and **G**. However, since the question asks for a single false statement, the most specific and likely intended answer is **B**.

ANSWER: B
