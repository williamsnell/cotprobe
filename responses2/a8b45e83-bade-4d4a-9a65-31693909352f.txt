"The husband was found dead in the chicken shed of his farm. His death resulted from wounds caused by a shotgun blast. The wife filed the necessary papers with the insurance company concerning proof of her husband's death. The insurance company admitted liability for the face amount of the policy but rejected the wife's claim for double indemnity. The wife then instituted suit against the insurance company demanding judgment according to the double indemnity provisions of the husband's insurance policy.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a law case involving insurance and a double indemnity clause. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a wife is a beneficiary of a life insurance policy. Her husband died from a shotgun blast in the chicken shed. The insurance policy had a clause saying that if the insured (here, her husband) dies and the cause is an external violence or unexpected injury, double indemnity (which I think means both the insurance company and the policyholder pay for each other's losses) is payable. But the insurance company only paid the face amount, not the double. The wife then sued the company for double indemnity because she's suing as the beneficiary, not as the insured.

When the wife testified, she said she was in the kitchen when she heard a shot. She rushed out, saw their neighbor running from the shed. The neighbor is present in court. 

The question is whether the wife is competent to testify. The options are about her ability to give a first-hand account, personal knowledge, etc.

I remember that for a witness to be competent, they must have the opportunity to take part in the event. If they can't, they might be called on behalf of the other party or could be excluded if they're not present.

In this case, the wife was in the kitchen when she heard the shot, and she rushed out. She saw the neighbor running out of the shed. Her testimony is based on what she saw and heard, which happened on the day her husband died. 

So, she was present when the event occurred. The neighbor is in court, which means the wife can testify about the event as it happened. She wasn't excluded because she wasn't the one who died but was in the kitchen at the time, hearing the shot. 

Wait, but she was right there with her husband. She saw the neighbor running out, so she can recount the event. Therefore, her testimony is competent because she was present at the scene.

Looking at the options, option E says she was present after the event. Option A says she can provide a first-hand account. Both seem correct.

But the options may have nuances. The question is about being competent. Competency is about the opportunity to take part in the event. Since she was present, she's competent.

So possible answers: E, F, I, J.

Option E: competent, because she had personal knowledge. Wait, personal knowledge is a type of knowledge, but for a witness, the key thing is whether they were present. So E is correct because she was present.

Wait, but what about the fact that she was a beneficiary and the insurance company? Does that affect her testimony? I think the reason she's a beneficiary is that she's the policyholder, but for her testimony, being present is the main issue.

So she was present, she can give testimony. Therefore, E is correct.

Wait, but the woman was in the kitchen, heard the shot, rushed out, saw the neighbor running. She was there when the event happened. So she can recount the facts, which makes her testimony competent. So E is correct.

Alternatively, option F says she was present after the event. Oh, but the event was her husband's death, so she was present when it happened. So F might be incorrect because the event was her husband's death, not hers.

Option J says she had a personal interest. The question doesn't mention her personal interests, so that's probably not correct.

Option E is about being present after the event, which is correct because she was present at the time. So for her testimony to be competent, she needed to be present. So she was present, so E is correct.

Wait, but the options have E and I. Let me think about the options again.

Option I: competent, because she can corroborate her account with the neighbor's testimony. That's about evidence, but the question is about the witness's own testimony's competence.

So the correct answer is E because she was present, so her testimony was competent.
</think>

The wife's testimony was competent because she was present at the scene of the event when her husband's death occurred. She was in the kitchen, heard the gunshot, and rushed out to see her neighbor running from the scene. This direct recounting of facts makes her testimony competent. 

Options:
- **A, B, F, G, H, J**: Incorrect because they either state insufficient evidence, lack personal knowledge, or claim personal interests, which are not present.
- **C, D, E**: Correct. Competency depends on being present; E is correct.
- **I, J**: Incorrect because they address the credibility of the evidence rather than the opportunity to take part in the event.

ANSWER: E
