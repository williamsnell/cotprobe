Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that a sample of CO₂ is 2.0 mol and occupies 15.0 dm³ at 300 K. When it's supplied with 2.35 kJ of heat, the temperature rises to 341 K. CO₂ is described by the van der Waals equation, and I need to calculate ΔH. The options are A to J, each with different values. Hmm, okay.

Wait, I remember that ΔH is the enthalpy change, which is the heat absorbed at constant pressure. But wait, the problem here is giving the heat at constant volume, right? Because when the system is at constant volume, the heat is q_v, which is equal to ΔH. But wait, wait. Wait, no. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The van der Waals equation is for a real gas, but the question says to assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Oh wait, no, it's specified that unless stated, we treat CO₂ as a perfect gas. Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: "Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K." So the data given are for 298 K, but the van der Waals equation is applicable here. But wait, for CO₂, the van der Waals equation is probably more accurate, but the problem says to use the perfect gas assumption except when stated. Wait, no, the question says "Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise." So wait, is CO₂ a perfect gas? Probably not. Because CO₂ is a real gas. Wait, but the question says "unless otherwise stated" the thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. So maybe the data given for the van der Waals data is at 298 K. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I should proceed regardless. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem says that 2.35 kJ of heat is supplied, and the temperature changes. The process is at constant volume because the volume is fixed (it says fixed volume). So the heat at constant volume is q_v, which equals the change in enthalpy, ΔH. So I think that's the answer. Because, for a process at constant volume, the heat is equal to the enthalpy change.

Wait, but the problem says "when it is supplied with 2.35 kJ of energy as heat its temperature increases to 341 K." So the heat given is q, which is 2.35 kJ. So since it's at constant volume, q_v = ΔH. So ΔH is +2.35 kJ, which is option J. So that would make the answer J. But wait, I need to make sure I'm not making any wrong assumptions.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the van der Waals equation is an equation of state for a real gas, which might affect the calculation. But the question says to use the perfect gas assumption unless stated otherwise. Oh wait, no, the problem says to assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. So the CO₂ in the problem is considered a perfect gas, which is probably not correct. But the problem's note says that thermochemical data are for 298 K. So perhaps the data given are for 298 K, but the van der Waals equation is for CO₂. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The van der Waals equation is applicable here, but the problem says all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Oh wait, no. The note says thermochemical data are for 298 K. So perhaps they're using the data at 298 K, which is why the given heat is at 298 K. But the question is about a process at a different temperature, 341 K, but the heat given is 2.35 kJ. So maybe I need to consider the heat capacity at constant volume or the heat capacity at constant pressure.

Wait, but the problem is giving heat as q, perhaps implying that it's a constant volume process. Because when the volume is fixed, heat is q_v, which is the change in enthalpy at constant volume, so ΔH = q_v.

But in reality, for an ideal gas, q_v is equal to nCv ΔT. So maybe I should compute that and see if it matches with the given heat of 2.35 kJ.

Wait, let's calculate that. For an ideal gas, the heat at constant volume is q_v = n C_v ΔT.

But wait, CO₂ is a diatomic molecule. For a monatomic gas, Cv is (3/2) R, but for diatomic, it's (5/2) R. Wait, wait: Wait, Cv for diatomic gases is (5/2)R when they are ideal. Because for diatomic, there are 5 degrees of freedom (3 translational, 2 rotational). Wait, but wait, in van der Waals, the calculation might include intermolecular forces and van der Waals constants. But the problem says to assume van der Waals, but perhaps the data is for the van der Waals equation, but the actual heat is based on the ideal gas law.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the van der Waals equation is not required here because the process is at constant volume, so q_v is the only thing that matters. But I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, let's think again. The question says that CO₂ is described by the van der Waals equation. But the data given (like heat) are for 298.15 K. Does that mean that the heat at 298 K is calculated using the van der Waals equation? Or is the heat at 298 K using the ideal gas law?

Wait, no. The problem says "unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K." So the given heat (2.35 kJ) is at 298 K. But the van der Waals equation applies to the actual gas, so perhaps the process is at a different temperature. Hmm, but the question is about the enthalpy change, which is a state function. So the heat absorbed should be the same whether the process is at constant volume or not, but wait I'm getting confused again.

Wait, no. Enthalpy is a state function. The heat at constant pressure (q_p) is equal to ΔH. But in this problem, the heat given is q_v, the heat at constant volume. So q_v = ΔH. So in that case, the enthalpy change is 2.35 kJ, which would be option J. So the answer is J.

But wait, suppose that the process is at constant volume, then q_v = ΔH. But the van der Waals equation is used to describe the gas. So perhaps the calculation of q_v is more involved than that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering q as the heat added at constant pressure. No, the question says the heat given is as heat, which is at constant volume. So I'm back to thinking that q_v = ΔH, which is 2.35 kJ.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it using the van der Waals equation, because the process is at a different temperature. Let's think about that. The van der Waals equation is P = [nRT/(V - b)] - a (n²)/(V²), but perhaps the calculation of enthalpy change isn't needed unless the problem is more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the ideal gas assumption for enthalpy calculation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the question says that all gases are perfect, except when stated. So in this case, CO₂ is a real gas, but the data given is for 298 K. So perhaps the data is about a hypothetical situation, and the van der Waals equation is needed for the solution.

But in the problem, the setup is that the process is supplied with heat, and the temperature increases. So the heat is at constant volume. So q_v = n C_v ΔT.

But wait, CO₂ is a diatomic molecule, so for ideal gases, C_v is (5/2) R, but for real gases, it's lower. But perhaps the problem is using the ideal gas data, so I can proceed under that assumption.

So let's compute q_v = n C_v (T2 - T1).

n is 2.0 mol, T1 is 300 K, T2 is 341 K. So ΔT is 41 K.

C_v for CO₂ being ideal is (5/2) R. R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So (5/2)*8.314 = 20.785 J/mol·K.

Wait, but wait, wait. If CO₂ is treated as a perfect gas, then it's ideal. But CO₂ is actually a real gas. So perhaps the van der Waals equation is needed to find the heat capacity at constant volume. Hmm, but the problem says to calculate ΔH, which is a state function. So maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the van der Waals equation is used to find the enthalpy change, but I don't see how that's necessary. Because the question says to calculate ΔH, which is the enthalpy change, but the given data are for 298 K.

Wait, perhaps the process is at constant volume, so the heat is q_v = n C_v ΔT. Let's proceed with that.

So, n=2.0 mol, C_v for CO₂ as an ideal gas is (5/2) R = 20.785 J/mol·K.

ΔT = 341-300 =41 K.

q_v = n * Cv * ΔT = 2 * 20.785 *41.

Let me calculate that.

2 * 20.785 =41.57

41.57 *41 = let's see, 40 *41.57=1662.8, plus 1.57 *41=64.97. So total 1662.8+64.97=1727.77 J, which is 1.72777 kJ.

Wait, but the given heat is 2.35 kJ. So there's a discrepancy here. So either the assumption is incorrect, or I'm missing something.

But the question states that the process is at constant volume, because the volume is fixed. So I think I need to use the given heat as q_v = ΔH. But according to my calculation, it's approximately 1.728 kJ, which is about 1.73 kJ. But the given heat is 2.35 kJ, so that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the process isn't at constant volume. Wait, the question says the volume is fixed, so it's a constant volume process. So q_v must equal ΔH. But according to the calculation, that's about 1.728 kJ, which is not one of the options. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the process isn't at constant volume. Let me recheck the problem. The problem says: "when it is supplied with 2.35 kJ of energy as heat its temperature increases to 341 K." So the heat given is the heat at constant volume, because the volume is fixed. So q_v = ΔH. Therefore, the given heat should be the ΔH.

But according to my calculation, it's 1.728 kJ, which doesn't match any of the options. Because the options start at 2.5 kJ and go up in 0.5 increments, except option H is 3.75, which is higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: the question says to assume CO₂ is described by the van der Waals equation. So perhaps the calculation of the enthalpy is more involved than just n C_v ΔT.

But wait, no. Because for a van der Waals gas, the internal energy isn't simply n Cv T. So maybe the van der Waals equation is needed to find the heat capacity at constant volume, or perhaps the process isn't at constant volume, which would change things.

But the problem states that the volume is fixed, so it's q_v. So I'm back to thinking that the correct approach is to find q_v = ΔH, so the given heat is 2.35 kJ, which is option J.

Wait, but why isn't the calculation matching? Let me recalculate the q_v.

n =2.0 mol

Cv = (5/2) R = 20.785 J/(mol·K)

ΔT=341-300=41 K

q_v = 2.0 * 20.785 *41

Compute the numbers:

20.785 *41 = ?

20.785 *40 = 831.4

20.785 *1 = 20.785

Total 831.4 + 20.785 = 852.185 J/mol.

Multiply by 2.0:

852.185 * 2 = 1704.37 J = 1.704 kJ.

Hmm, so about 1.704 kJ, which is 1.704 kJ, or approximately 1.7 kJ. But the given heat is 2.35 kJ, so this suggests that either the process isn't at constant volume, or I made an error in the assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.

The problem states that the heat is supplied at a constant volume, because the volume is fixed. So the heat is q_v. So the heat given is equal to ΔH. So according to the problem, the heat is 2.35 kJ, which is the correct answer, option J.

So why then, when computing using the ideal gas assumption, I get a different answer?

Ah, because CO₂ is a real gas, but the problem gives the heat at 298 K, which is the molar heat capacity at constant volume, which is (5/2) R. Because for real gases, the molar heat capacity at constant volume is less than the ideal case.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The problem says: "2.0 mol of CO₂ occupies 15.0 dm³ at 300 K. When it is supplied with 2.35 kJ of energy as heat its temperature increases to 341 K."

Wait, so the data given are for 298 K. So perhaps the 2.35 kJ is the heat at 298 K. But the process is happening at 341 K. So this complicates things.

Wait, but the problem says "all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise". So perhaps the process is at 298 K, and the given heat is at that temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that the heat is supplied at 341 K. So I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the 2.35 kJ is the heat at 298 K, and the process is at a different temperature, so I can't just use the ideal gas heat equation.

But this is getting too complicated. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's think about the first law of thermodynamics.

ΔH = q_v + w

But no, wait, for constant volume, w is the work done, which is P_ext * ΔV. But since volume is fixed, ΔV is zero, so work w is zero. So ΔH = q_v.

Thus, q_v should equal ΔH.

So the heat given is q_v, which is 2.35 kJ. So ΔH is 2.35 kJ. So the correct answer should be J, option J.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using ideal gas, I got about 1.7 kJ, which is different. But perhaps the problem isn't using the ideal gas assumption, but the van der Waals equation is. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the heat at constant volume using the van der Waals equation.

Wait, but without knowing the actual data for the van der Waals constants a and b, I can't compute that. I think the van der Waals equation is given, but perhaps the question wants us to use the data given. So I'm stuck.

In any case, the question states that the process is at constant volume, so I should proceed with q_v = ΔH. So the given heat is 2.35 kJ, so the correct answer is J. Thus, the correct option is J.

The problem involves calculating the enthalpy change (ΔH) for a sample of CO₂ under constant volume conditions. The van der Waals equation is provided, but the question specifies that CO₂ is described by this equation. The key points of the analysis are as follows:

1. **Understanding the Process**:  
   The problem states that the heat is supplied at constant volume, as indicated by the fixed volume of 15.0 dm³. Therefore, the heat at constant volume (q_v) is equal to the enthalpy change (ΔH) at constant volume.

2. **Heat Given**:  
   The problem explicitly states that 2.35 kJ of energy is supplied as heat. Since the volume is fixed, this heat corresponds directly to the enthalpy change (ΔH). Thus, ΔH = 2.35 kJ.

3. **Options**:  
   The options provided are:  
   A: +3.25 kJ  
   B: +4.00 kJ  
   C: +1.98 kJ  
   D: +4.50 kJ  
   E: +3.50 kJ  
   F: +2.50 kJ  
   G: +3.75 kJ  
   H: +3.03 kJ  
   I: +2.75 kJ  
   J: +2.35 kJ  

   Since the heat given is 2.35 kJ and it corresponds to ΔH, the correct answer is **J: +2.35 kJ**.
