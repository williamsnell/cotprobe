Okay, so I have this question here about the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth. Let's see, the lowest point is the Mariana Trench at 35,840 feet below sea level, and the highest is the summit of Mt. Everest at 29,028 feet above sea level. The question is asking for the best estimate of the distance between these two points.

Hmm, I need to calculate the distance between the two points. Oh wait, but wait. The Mariana Trench is below sea level, and the mountain is above. So the total distance between them would be the sum of their distances from sea level. But wait, noâ€”because one is below and the other is above. So, the Mariana is 35,840 feet under, and the mountain is 29,028 feet up. So the distance between them is 35,840 + 29,028 feet. Let me add that up.

35,840 plus 29,028. Let's do the math. 35,000 plus 29,000 is 64,000. Then 840 plus 28 is 868. So total is 64,868 feet. Hmm, that's approximately 65,000 feet. Looking at the options, B is 65,000 feet. So that would be the best estimate.

Wait, but is that correct? Oh, because I'm adding the two heights. Or wait, maybe I should think about it as the sum of the two distances from sea level. Yeah, because the bottom is 35,840 feet below sea level, and the top is 29,028 feet above, so the distance between them is the sum of those two. So 35,840 +29,028 = 64,868, which is about 65,000. So option B.

The Mariana Trench is 35,840 feet below sea level, and the highest point, Mt. Everest, is 29,028 feet above sea level. To find the distance between them, add the two distances: 35,840 + 29,028 = 64,868 feet, approximately 65,000 feet. The best estimate is **65,000 feet**.

Answer: B
