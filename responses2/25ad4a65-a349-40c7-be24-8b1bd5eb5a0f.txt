How doesAllport'sconcept of functional autonomy differ from most other theories of motivation?

Options:

Okay, so I've got this question about Allport's concept of functional autonomy versus other theories of motivation. Hmm, I need to remember what I learned about this. Let me try to break it down.

First, functionalism in psychology is all about how behavior is shaped by internal factors. So, functional autonomy would be a theory that focuses on internal motives, right? Allport, I think, was a major proponent of this. He talked a lot about internal drives and how they influence behavior.

Looking at the options, the question is asking how functional autonomy differs from other theories. Let's see the options again:

A: Functional autonomy permits a relative divorce from the past of the organism. Wait, I'm not sure what that means. I think Allport's theory was about internal drives, not about past consequences. So maybe this isn't correct.

B: Functional autonomy maintains that current motives are directly tied to an individual's history. No, that sounds like it's saying that past behaviors influence current ones. That doesn't sound right. I thought Allport was about internal factors, not external.

C: Functional autonomy posits that behavior is always a reaction to immediate stimuli. No, that doesn't fit. Allport's theory emphasized internal drives rather than external stimuli. So I don't think this is correct.

D: Functional autonomy indicates that motivation decreases as the organism ages. I remember that Allport's concept didn't focus on aging. In fact, he was critical of traditional theories that linked aging to motivation. So maybe this is incorrect.

E: Functional autonomy relies heavily on biological drives. Yes, that sounds right. Allport was concerned with the internal factors, like need, drive, etc., which are biological. So this seems related to what I thought.

F: Functional autonomy suggests all behavior is a result of learned associations. No, that doesn't fit. I thought functional autonomy was about internal factors influencing behavior, not learned associations.

G: Functional autonomy is solely determined by external rewards and punishments. No, that's more about operant conditioning. Allport was more about internal factors, not external rewards.

H: Functional autonomy emphasizes past experiences. No, Allport focused on internal factors, not past experiences. So this is incorrect.

I: Functional autonomy requires constant biological reinforcement. No, I think Allport didn't require constant reinforcement. He was more about the internal drives leading to behavior without constant reinforcement.

J: Functional autonomy is only applicable in early childhood development. No, I don't think Allport's theory is limited to early childhood. It's about general principles.

So, looking back, option E seems correct because Allport was concerned with biological drives, which are internal, not external. The question is about the difference from other theories, and since Allport focused on internal factors, E is the correct answer.
</think>

The correct answer is E: Functional autonomy emphasizes past experiences. 

**Explanation:**
Allport's concept of functional autonomy focuses on internal factors contributing to behavior, such as biological drives, rather than external rewards or punishments. This theory, developed in the context of psychological studies, highlights that behavior is shaped by internal needs and drives. Therefore, it differs from theories that emphasize external rewards or operant conditioning. 

**Answer:** E
