Question:

During a paternity trial, the mother's attorney asks to have the baby girl, now 36 months old, exhibited for the purpose of calling attention to certain facial resemblances between the child and the reputed father. The defendant's attorney objects to the offering of the baby into evidence for comparison. The trial judge should

Options:

A: permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.

G: permit the child to be exhibited, but only under specific conditions set by the court.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this paternity trial question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details. 

The scenario is that the mother's attorney is asking the baby girl, who's 36 months old, to be exhibited. The goal is to call attention to facial similarities between the child and a supposed father. The defendant's attorney objects, and the trial judge needs to decide what to do.

Hmm. What do I know about evidence in paternity cases? From what I remember, the key point is about evidence admissibility. The baby's face should be a legitimate example, not something that could be proven false or should be a burden on the credibility of the mother. 

Wait, the baby's face is being exhibited as evidence. I think that's not allowed because it's considered a "non-objectionable form of evidence." That's a term I've heard before. So the evidence must be admissible for its own sake, not for any purpose other than legal defense. 

The question says the attorney is asking to exhibit the baby, and the defendant is objecting because it's not an objectionable form of evidence. So the trial judge needs to decide whether to permit it. 

Looking at the options, the options are about whether the court should allow the baby to be exhibited as evidence. So the options are about whether the court can permit the baby, and under what conditions.

Option A says permit it as non-objectionable evidence. But I thought that's not allowed. I remember that the court can allow such evidence under the "non-objectionable form of evidence" exception, which is one of the hearsay exceptions. Wait, no, wait, I might be mixing up exceptions. 

Wait, there's the "non-objectionable form of evidence" exception, which is a hearsay exception. So the trial court can grant permission under that exception if it's a non-objectionable form. So that's an option. 

But wait, another point is that the mother's attorney is offering it to call attention to certain facial resemblances. I think that's not allowed unless it's for a purpose other than the child's defense. But the defense might not be the only purpose. Wait, the attorney is offering it as evidence because they want to show the resemblance. But in a paternity trial, the focus is usually on the child's heritage and the supposed father's family ties, not facial similarities. So maybe the facial similarities are more of a defense to the mother's case, not the father's. 

Hmm, but this situation is about exhibiting the baby for evidence. So the trial court must consider whether the evidence is admissible for its own purposes. So the child's face is being shown as evidence, but I think it's not allowed because it's a form of evidence that could be proven false. 

Wait, but the question is whether the court should permit it. So the options are about whether the court should allow it under certain conditions. 

Option A allows it as non-objectionable evidence. But I thought that was an exception, not a permission. Wait, no, the "non-objectionable form of evidence" is a hearsay exception, so the court can grant permission. So the court can permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of evidence. 

Wait, but another point: when evidence is being presented for its own purposes, the court must allow it. So the trial judge has the right to permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of evidence. So that would be option A. 

Wait, but let me think again. The "non-objectionable form of evidence" is a hearsay exception. So the court can grant permission under that exception. So if the court allows it, the child's face is being shown as evidence, but it's not a hearsay issue. So the judge can permit it. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because another hearsay exception is "non-hearsay," but that's not the case here. The issue is about whether the face is admissible for its purpose. So the court should grant permission to exhibit the baby as a non-objectionable form of evidence because it's a legitimate way to demonstrate facial similarities, even though it might be considered a non-hearsay form. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if the defense that the face is a non-hearsay form is a valid argument. Because the face is likely hearsay, but being non-hearsay is a legal principle. However, in this case, the question is about admissibility for its own purpose, not for the purpose of the defense. So the court must grant permission to exhibit the baby as a non-objectionable form. 

Looking at the options again, option A says 'permit the child to be exhibited as non-objectionable.' So that should be allowed. 

Wait, but another option, option F says not to permit it because it could emotionally distress the child. That might be a reason, but I'm not sure if the court necessarily has to consider emotional distress as a reason. I think courts typically look at the admissibility of evidence, not whether it's emotionally distressing. 

So the correct answer would be A. But wait, another point: the defense might be that the face is not a reliable evidence. But the question is about the trial judge's decision, not the defense's. So the trial judge can grant permission under the non-objectionable form exception. 

So the options: the judge should permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of evidence. So option A says that. 

Wait, but another thought: the "non-objectionable form of evidence" is a hearsay exception. So the court must grant permission to present it as evidence. So the trial judge is allowed to permit it under that exception. 

So the correct answer is A. But wait, looking at the options again, option F is about emotional distress. But in this case, the face is being exhibited for a purpose other than the child's defense. So perhaps the court doesn't have to consider emotional distress as a reason. 

Wait, no, emotional distress is a consideration in the trial of evidence, but the key is whether the evidence is admissible for its purpose. So if the court allows it, it's because it's a non-objectionable form, regardless of emotional impact. 

So the answer should be A. But wait, I'm confused because I thought the court can't grant permission for non-hearsay evidence. Wait, but the issue is about the form of evidence, so it's a hearsay exception. 

Wait, another angle: if the mother's attorney is offering the baby as evidence for facial similarities, which is a defense to the mother's case, not the father's. But the trial judge's purpose is to determine whether the child can be exhibited as evidence. 

If the court allows it, then the child's face is being presented as evidence. But the court can do that under the non-objectionable form exception. So the answer is option A. 

Wait, but some sources I remember say that the court can't grant permission to exhibit evidence for its own purposes unless it's a non-hearsay form. But that's not correct. The "non-objectionable form of evidence" is a hearsay exception, so the court can grant permission. 

So the correct answer is A. But wait, another thought: the father's attorney is objecting, so perhaps the defense is that the evidence is hearsay. But no, the issue is about the form, not the hearsay status. 

So the judge should permit it as a non-objectionable form. So option A.

The trial judge should permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of evidence because it is a legitimate form of evidence suitable for its own purpose. The court can grant permission under the "non-objectionable form of evidence" exception, which is a hearsay exception allowing the presentation of evidence for its own purposes. 

Answer: A
