Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the percentage of the world's population living in extreme poverty as of 2019. Let me start by recalling what I know about poverty statistics.

First, extreme poverty is defined as living below the buying power of $1.90 a day. That's pretty low, so I'm guessing the percentage is quite small. I remember that in many parts of the world, especially developing regions, the living standards are much lower. I think around 10-20% of the population might be in extreme poverty. Wait, but I'm not sure. I should probably break this down.

I think the World Bank or other organizations publish such data. From what I recall, in 2019, the global poverty statistics were around 5-6%. But wait, that's for extreme poverty. Wait, no, maybe the total poverty rate is higher. Let me get this straight. The global poverty rate includes all below the poverty line, which is $3.15 a day. So the extreme poverty is a subset of that.

So, according to some sources, as of 2019, the global poverty rate was about 21%, and extreme poverty was about 5-6%. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think if any data points I remember. I believe the extreme poverty rate was around 5-6%. So looking at the options, the closest is option E:5% or option F:20%. Wait, but I thought it was closer to 6, but the options don't have 6. So the options are 5, 20, etc. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:
A:35%
B:10%
C:50%
D:45%
E:5%
F:20%
G:15%
H:25%
I:40%
J:30%

So 5% is an option (E). But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought it was somewhere around 5% or 6%. So if the data says about 5%, then E is correct. But wait, another thought: maybe the extreme poverty rate is around 4.5% or 5%. So 5% is E. But I've heard some sources mention it as around 5% or 6%. So the correct answer would be E or F? Wait, no, because 5 is E, 6 isn't an option. Oh wait, the question is about 2019, so maybe the numbers changed a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps the options given are approximate. For example, option E is 5% and option F is 20%. I'm a bit unsure. I think I remember that the global extreme poverty rate in 2019 was under 6%, but perhaps the options don't have 6. So if the closest option is E (5%), then E is the answer. Alternatively, maybe the data is more like 4.5% or 5%, so E.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the answer is 5% (E) or 6% which isn't an option. So the best fit is E:5%.

The correct answer is **E: 5%**, as it aligns with the approximate percentage of the world's population living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) as of 2019. 

Answer: E
