Okay, so I've got this question about the author, I think it's about the article "Will Cloning Harm People?" by someone named Pence. The question is asking what the main objective of the article is. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different goal.

Hmm, I remember that in ethics, especially about cloning, people often talk about Kantian and utilitarian perspectives. So, the article's title is "Cloning Harm People?" which makes me think it's about the moral implications of cloning, probably arguing against it.

I need to figure out what the main objective is. The options are about the methods or purposes used in the article. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Use Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is morally acceptable. Wait, but the article is about making cloning harm people, so I don't think that's the main point. I don't think the author is advocating for cloning being okay.

Option B: Argue for the potential benefits of cloning. No, that's the opposite. The question is about the main objective, which is about the main reason for writing the article.

Option C: Use consequentialist arguments to show cloning is immoral. That could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if that's the main point of the article.

Option D: Use virtue ethics to prove cloning is morally unacceptable. Again, that's a valid approach, but I'm not certain if it's the primary objective.

Option E: Use Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is immoral. I'm not sure about the specifics here. I think some authors use Kantian arguments, but I don't know if that's the main goal of this particular article.

Option F: Use utilitarian arguments to show that cloning is immoral. Utilitarianism focuses on the best interests of the greatest number, but I'm not sure if that's the main focus here.

Option G: Object to consequentialist arguments against cloning. Hmm, maybe the author is trying to counter the critiques from consequentialists. So, perhaps the main goal is to argue against certain views.

Option H: Argue that cloning is ethically neutral. No, that doesn't make sense. The article is about the moral harm, so neutrality isn't the main point.

Option I: Object to Kant's arguments against cloning. Maybe the author is responding to something from Kant, like the idea that cloning is moral.

Option J: Use consequentialist arguments to prove that cloning is morally acceptable. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the article is about making cloning harmful.

Wait, the article's title is "Cloning Harm People?" which suggests the author is arguing against cloning, pointing out its moral issues. So, the main objective would be to present arguments against cloning—like using different ethical theories to show that cloning is morally wrong.

Looking at the options, option E says "use Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is immoral." Option J says "use consequentialist arguments to prove cloning is morally acceptable." But if the main objective is to show moral harm, then E and J are about that.

Wait, the article's title is "Will Cloning Harm People?" So the author is probably arguing against cloning because it's harmful. So the main objective would be to present arguments against cloning, perhaps using ethical theories.

So, looking at the options, option E says "use Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is immoral." Option J says "use consequentialist arguments to prove cloning is morally acceptable." Which one is correct?

I think the author might be using Kantian arguments, but the exact wording in the article isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the article is arguing against the use of cloning, like using utilitarianism or another ethical framework.

Wait, another angle: in the context of the question, the article is titled "Cloning Harm People?" which could mean the author is criticizing cloning for causing harm, perhaps because it's not beneficial. So the main objective is to argue that cloning is morally wrong.

Looking at the options, option E and J are about using different ethical arguments. Option E uses Kantian methods, which are more about deontological ethics, whereas J uses consequentialist, which focus on outcomes.

In the absence of knowing exactly, I'd think the main point is to argue against cloning, which would involve using ethical frameworks to show it's wrong. So, option E, which says to use Kant's to show it's immoral, might be the correct answer.

Wait, but option E says "use Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is immoral." Option J is about proving it's morally acceptable, which doesn't align with the article's title.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: the article's title is "Cloning Harm People?" so the author is arguing that cloning is morally wrong. So their main goal is to present a defense against cloning's moral issues.

Looking at the options, option E: "use Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is immoral." Option J: "use consequentialist arguments to prove cloning is morally acceptable." Both relate to moral harm.

Wait, maybe the article is arguing that cloning is morally unacceptable. So, the author might be presenting reasons (like Kantian) to show that cloning is wrong. So, option E would be the main objective.

Alternatively, maybe the article is using utilitarianism or another framework. But the options don't give that much detail.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think of the options again.

The question is about the main objective. The options are about the methods the author is using. So, the main goal is to present arguments, perhaps.

If the article is about the moral issues with cloning, the author's main objective is to argue against cloning—perhaps using various ethical theories to show that cloning is wrong.

So, looking at the options, option E is about using Kant's to show it's immoral. Option J is about proving it's morally acceptable, which is the opposite.

Wait, but the article's title is "Cloning Harm People?" So, the author is arguing that cloning is wrong, so the main objective is to show that cloning is morally wrong. So, the author might be using a consequentialist or utilitarian approach to argue against cloning.

So, looking at the options, option J is about using consequentialist arguments to prove it's morally acceptable. No, that's the opposite of the author's point. So perhaps option E is correct, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the article is arguing against cloning by using a Kantian framework, which is more about duties than consequences. So, option E.

Wait, another approach: the options with the same letter are about different ethical theories. If the author is using Kantian methods, option E is that. If using consequentialist, option J.

Wait, the question is about the main objective, regardless of the method. So, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's about using Kantianism to argue against cloning.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J because the author is using a consequentialist argument to show that cloning is morally acceptable, but that doesn't make sense because the article's title is about moral harm.

Wait, the article is titled "Cloning Harm People?" So, the main objective is to argue for the moral harm, hence the main goal is to present reasons against cloning.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer would be E: to use Kant's to show cloning is immoral. Because that's about argument against cloning.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because it's about demonstrating that cloning is morally wrong, using Kantian framework.

The question asks about the main objective of the article "Will Cloning Harm People?" by a specific author. The article's title suggests the author's goal is to argue against cloning because it causes moral harm. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it focuses on moral acceptability, which is the opposite of the article's argument.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it aims to argue for cloning's benefits, which contradicts the article's stance.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it involves showing cloning's immorality using consequentialist arguments, but the article's focus is on moral harm.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it involves proving cloning's moral unacceptableity through virtue ethics, which is not the main focus.
- **Option E**: Correct, as it uses Kantian formulations to demonstrate cloning's moral immorality, aligning with the article's objective.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it focuses on utilitarianism, which is not the primary argument.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it suggests objecting to Kantian arguments, which doesn't fit the article's purpose.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as it involves opposing Kantian arguments, which isn't the main goal.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it focuses on proving moral acceptability, opposite of the article's stance.
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as it involves proving moral acceptability, which contradicts the article's argument.

The article's main objective is to argue against cloning's moral harm, best achieved through Kantian frameworks.
