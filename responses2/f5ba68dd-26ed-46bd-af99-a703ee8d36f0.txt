Okay, so I've got this optics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about finding a single lens that's equivalent to having a converging and a diverging lens in contact. The focal lengths are given as 6 cm for the converging lens and 10 cm for the diverging lens. I need to find which single lens would replace this combination, and the options are various converging or diverging lenses with different focal lengths.

Hmm, I remember that when two lenses are in contact, their focal lengths are combined somehow. I think it's like adding their focal lengths, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if a lens is converging, its focal length is positive, and diverging is negative.

Wait, the problem says it's a thin converging and a thin diverging lens. So the first lens is +6 cm (converging), the second is -10 cm (diverging). 

I think the formula for combining lenses in contact is 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2. Wait, no, that's for combining two thin lenses in contact. Let me think again. Oh, right, when you combine two thin lenses in contact, the formula is 1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/f_total. Or is it 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2? Wait that doesn't sound right. Because for thin lenses, the combined focal length is given by the formula 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2 when they're in contact. But I'm a bit confused—wait, actually, the formula is 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2. Because each lens contributes its own focal length in reciprocal addition.

Wait, but wait, I've read that for thin lenses, the formula is actually 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2, but wait, that can't be right because if both are converging, 1/f_total would be positive, but that doesn't match with the example I'm thinking of. Let me think of an example: a converging lens of 10 cm and a diverging of 10 cm. The combined focal length would be negative, since a diverging lens in contact with a converging one would be like a negative combination. So 1/f = 1/10 + 1/(-10) = 0. So f would be infinite, which makes sense because it's a diverging lens equivalent.

So in this problem, the converging is +6 cm, diverging is -10 cm.

So 1/f_total = 1/6 + 1/(-10) = (10 - 6)/(60) )=4/60=1/15. So f_total is 15 cm. But wait, that would be if they're in contact, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, that would make the equivalent lens a converging one with 15 cm. But looking at the options, option B is 15 cm diverging, and option H is 10 cm converging, and I is 15 cm converging.

Wait, but in the case of 1/6 + 1/(-10) = 1/f. Let me calculate again. 

Wait, 1/6 is approximately 0.1667, 1/(-10) is -0.1. So 0.1667 - 0.1 = 0.0667, which is 1/15. So that would mean f_total is 15 cm, but that's a converging lens because the sum is positive.

Wait, but wait, that's if you just add the reciprocals. Wait, but I thought when you combine two thin lenses in contact, the formula is 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2. So here, 1/6 + 1/(-10) = (5 -3)/30 = 2/30 = 1/15. So f_total is 15 cm, positive, so it's a converging lens.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because I thought when you have a converging and a diverging lens in contact, the result is a diverging lens. Or is this a coincidence?

Wait, let me think. Let me take a concrete example. Imagine a converging lens of 10 cm and a diverging lens of 10 cm. Then 1/f = 1/10 + 1/(-10) = 0. So f is infinite, which is a diverging lens. So in that case, the combination is a diverging lens.

But in our problem, the sum is 1/15, so 15 cm. Which is a converging lens. So the combined focal length is 15 cm, so a converging lens with 15 cm. So that would be option B.

Wait, but the options include an 10 cm converging lens (option H) and 6 cm diverging (option E). 

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, the formula for thin lenses when combined in contact is indeed 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2, regardless of the individual signs. So the diverging lens has a negative focal length, so 1/f2 is negative.

So in our case, 1/f_total = 1/6 + 1/(-10) = (5 -3)/30 = 2/30 = 1/15. So f_total is 15 cm. So the equivalent is a 15 cm converging lens. 

Looking at the options, option B is 15 cm diverging, option H is 10 cm converging. So the correct answer is option B? Or am I missing something?

Wait, but wait, another thought: Why do these two combine into 15 cm converging? Because a converging lens (positive) and a diverging lens (negative) would have a combined focal length calculated as 1/6 + 1/(-10) = 1/15. So f is 15 cm, and since the sum is positive, the lens is converging. So the equivalent is a 15 cm converging lens. 

But looking at the options, option H is 10 cm converging. Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the lens formula for thin lenses. Wait, wait, the formula for thin lens is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). But in this problem, it's assuming the lens is thin, so n-1 is negligible; we can ignore it, so the formula simplifies to 1/f = 1/R1 - 1/R2. But since the problem says the lenses are thin, maybe we can ignore the refractive index and just consider 1/f1 = 1/R1 and 1/f2 = 1/R2. So for thin lenses, the focal length is the reciprocal of the radius of curvature, assuming they are thin.

But in this problem, perhaps it's simpler to think about the thin lens equation as 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2, where the signs are considered.

So, in that case, the combined focal length is 15 cm, so a converging lens. Which would be option B. But wait, I thought that when a converging and a diverging are combined, the result is a diverging lens. Hmm, now I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me re-examine the example. If I have a converging lens of 10 cm and a diverging of 10 cm, then 1/f_total = 1/10 + 1/(-10) = 0. So f_total is infinite, which is a diverging lens. So in that case, the combination is a diverging lens.

But in our problem, the sum is 1/6 + 1/(-10) = 1/15, so f_total is 15 cm, which is positive. So that would be a converging lens, not diverging.

So the correct answer would be a 15 cm converging lens. Looking at the options, option B is 15 cm diverging, option H is 10 cm converging. So option H is 10 cm, which is a converging lens but with a shorter focal length.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the sign. Because the formula includes the sign, let me re-examine.

Wait, 1/f_total = 1/6 + 1/(-10) = (10 -6)/(60) )=4/60=1/15. So 1/f_total is 1/15, so f_total is 15 cm. So the combined lens is a converging lens, 15 cm. So the answer would be option B.

But wait, another way: Since the combined focal length is 15 cm, which is positive, so it's a converging lens. So option B is 15 cm diverging, which is negative, so it's diverging, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the formula is different for thin lenses in contact. I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again.

Another approach: Think about the thin lens formula. The combined focal length of two thin lenses in contact is given by 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2. So if the two are in contact, their principal planes are at the same point, and their optical paths add.

So, using the formula: 1/f = 1/6 + 1/(-10) = 1/6 - 1/10.

Compute: (5 - 3)/30 = 2/30 = 1/15. So f = 15 cm. So it's positive, converging.

So the equivalent is a 15 cm converging lens. Looking at the options, option B is 15 cm diverging, so that's not correct. Option H is 10 cm converging, which is not 15. So I think I made a mistake earlier. 

Wait, wait, perhaps I should have considered the formula as 1/f_total = (1/f1) + (1/f2). Because for thin lenses, this is correct.

So with f1 =6 cm (converging, positive), f2 = 10 cm (diverging, negative). So 1/6 + 1/(-10) = (10 -6)/60 =4/60 =1/15. So f_total =15 cm.

So the equivalent is a 15 cm converging lens. So looking at the options, option B is 15 cm diverging, which is not that. So perhaps I should re-examine the options provided.

Wait, the options are:

A:5 cm diverging
B:15 cm diverging
C:4 cm converging
D:24 cm converging
E:6 cm diverging
F:20 cm diverging
G:3 cm diverging
H:10 cm converging
I:15 cm converging
J:8 cm converging

So the correct answer should be a 15 cm converging lens, which is option I.

So why did I think it was option B earlier? Because perhaps I confused the formula and thought the sum would be negative. But no, the formula is 1/6 + 1/(-10) which is 1/15. So f is positive, 15 cm.

But wait, another way: Could it be that when combining a converging and a diverging lens, the combined focal length is negative? Because in the example, 10 cm and 10 cm gives f = inifinite (diverging), which is negative. So in our case, 1/6 + 1/(-10) = 1/15, which is positive, so converging.

So the correct option is I:15 cm converging lens.

Wait, but let me check another approach. I remember that when two lenses are placed in contact, their combined focal length is given by 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2, but only when they are thin and their principal planes are aligned.

So, 1/f_total = 1/6 + 1/(-10) = (10 -6)/(60) )=4/60 = 1/15 → f_total is 15 cm. So the equivalent is a 15 cm converging lens. So the correct option is I, which is 15 cm converging.

To determine the equivalent single lens for a thin converging lens of focal length 6 cm and a thin diverging lens of focal length 10 cm in contact, we use the formula for combining thin lenses in contact:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2}
\]

Here, the converging lens has \( f_1 = 6 \, \text{cm} \) (positive, since it is converging), and the diverging lens has \( f_2 = -10 \, \text{cm} \) (negative, since it is diverging). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{-10} = \frac{10}{60} - \frac{6}{60} = \frac{4}{60} = \frac{1}{15}
\]

Thus, the total focal length is:

\[
f_{\text{total}} = 15 \, \text{cm}
\]

Since the total focal length is positive, the equivalent lens is a converging lens with a focal length of 15 cm. Examining the options provided:

- **A: 5 cm diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is 15 cm.
- **B: 15 cm diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is positive.
- **C: 4 cm converging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is 15 cm.
- **D: 24 cm converging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is 15 cm.
- **E: 6 cm diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is positive.
- **F: 20 cm diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is positive.
- **G: 3 cm diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is positive.
- **H: 10 cm converging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is 15 cm.
- **I: 15 cm converging** — Correct, as the focal length is 15 cm.
- **J: 8 cm converging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is positive.
- **K: 15 cm diverging** — Incorrect, as the focal length is positive.

The correct answer is **I: 15 cm converging lens**.
