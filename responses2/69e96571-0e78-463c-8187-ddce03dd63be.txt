Question:

A builder sold a new house to a buyer for use as the buyer's residence. The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?

Options:

A: No, because the builder cannot accept the deed while also holding the mortgage.
B: No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.
C: Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.
D: No, because the builder coerced the buyer into deeding the house back.
E: Yes, because the buyer defaulted on the mortgage payments.
F: Yes, because the builder originally held the mortgage.
G: Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.
H: No, because the buyer still technically owns the house until foreclosure.
I: No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about a builder selling a house and the buyer's ability to claim it. Hmm.

Alright, so the scenario is this: The builder sold the house to the buyer for their residence. The buyer paid 10% down and financed the rest with a mortgage. A year later, the buyer missed payments and couldn't pay anymore. The builder suggested the buyer deeded it back to him. The buyer did that. The question is whether the builder now owns fee simple title.

I remember that when a buyer fails to pay a mortgage, they're considered in breach. But wait, the mortgage was a promissory note and purchase money mortgage, which I think is a type of mortgage where the buyer pays down the principal each month. So if the buyer misses payments, that's a breach of the terms.

In such cases, the builder might have the right to foreclose. But the builder here is suggesting the buyer deeds the house back. I'm trying to recall the law on property reversion.

So, when a buyer deeded the property back, that's called a reversion. But wait, if the builder is still in possession, can he claim the reversion? I think there's a rule about the owner's right to foreclose and the legal availability of the property.

Oh, right! There's a doctrine called equitable reversion. The builder might have a legal right to reclaim the property if the buyer fails to meet the terms. But wait, in this case, the builder is selling the house and the buyer is paying off 90% of the price with their down payment. But they missed the payments, so the builder is in breach.

Wait, but the buyer had the option to re- Acquire the title. If the buyer fails to pay, the builder can claim a reversion. But wait, does the reversion take priority over foreclosures? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think that the reversion can be enforced by the builder. So the builder can take the property back. But the buyer had the option to foreclose, but the reversion might be a way to get the title back. But if the reversion is granted, then the title is back. But the buyer might still have the right to foreclose, but if the reversion is in place, the buyer would be forced to pay off the mortgage first, right? Because the builder can take the reversion.

But wait, there's another angle. The original mortgage was a purchase money mortgage, which is a type of mortgage that doesn't require the buyer to pay interest, but the term continues if the buyer fails to make payments. So the buyer is in a position of breach.

So when the buyer fails to pay, the builder can take the property back. But could the buyer still be able to claim the reversion? Or does the reversion take precedence over the mortgage?

I think the reversion is a legal right. So the builder can take the property back, but the buyer might still have the right to foreclose. But the question is about the builder owning the fee simple title. So the question is whether the reversion allows the builder to reclaim.

Wait, the options include G: Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption. equitable redemption refers to the ability to reclaim the title. So if the reversion is granted, the title is back.

But wait, the buyer had 90% down. But regardless of the down, the reversion allows the builder to take the property back. So in this case, the builder can execute a deed to the buyer, deeding the property, which would be equitable redemption.

So the answer would be G: Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.

Wait, but wait another thought. The original mortgage was a purchase money mortgage. Is that a permissible form of mortgage? I think purchase money mortgages are allowed; it doesn't require the buyer to pay interest. So the builder can foreclose if the buyer doesn't pay. But the buyer's failure to pay results in the builder re-claiming the property.

So the buyer's failure to pay could lead the builder to re-claim the property. So the builder can take the property back. So the answer is G: Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.

Alternatively, another angle: if the buyer re-claims, the buyer is committing to pay the mortgage. So the builder can take the property back and foreclose, but the buyer is still subject to the mortgage. Alternatively, the reversion would allow the builder to take the property back, so the title is no longer with the buyer.

Wait, no, if the reversion is granted, then the title is back. So the builder could execute a deed to the buyer, deeding the property. So the answer would be G.

Another thought: the original mortgage was a purchase money mortgage. So the buyer can foreclose on it, but the builder is selling the house. So the reversion would allow the builder to take the house back. So the answer is G.

Looking at the options, option G says Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption. That rings a bell.

The buyer missed mortgage payments and the builder suggested deeding the house back. The question is whether the builder now owns fee simple title. 

The key legal principle here is the doctrine of equitable redemption, which allows the owner of a mortgage to reclaim the property. The builder sold the house and the buyer had the option to re-claim, which is equitable redemption. This doctrine enables the builder to execute a deed to the buyer, deeding the property, and reclaiming it. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.**
