Okay, so I've got this problem about deterministic finite automata (DFAs) and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question says: Let k >= 2. Let L be the set of strings in {0,1}^* such that x is in L if and only if the number of 0's is divisible by k and the number of 1's is odd. We need to find the minimum number of states in a DFA that recognizes L. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm. So, I remember that DFAs can be constructed using the product of automata for different properties. Since L requires two conditions—count of 0's divisible by k and count of 1's odd—I think we need two separate automata for each condition and then combine them.

First, let's handle the condition on 0's. The number of 0's needs to be divisible by k. So, for the 0's part, the automaton must track how many 0's are read. Since it's modulo k, the states can be 0, 1, 2, ..., k-1. So, that's k states. For example, if k is 2, the states would be even and odd counts of 0's. So, for 0's part, the number of states is k.

Next, for the 1's part, the number must be odd. That's a bit simpler. The states here can be 0 (even) or 1 (odd). So, 2 states.

Wait, but how do these two automata interact? Because the DFA needs to satisfy both conditions simultaneously. So, I think the product automaton approach is correct. The total number of states would be the product of the states of each individual automaton.

So, for the 0's automaton, we have k states, and for the 1's automaton, 2 states. So, the product automaton has k * 2 = 2k states in total.

Wait, but let me think again. Because for the 1's condition, it's about the count being odd, so maybe the automaton for 1's has states 0 (even) and 1 (odd). So, yeah, 2 states.

So, the product automaton would have k * 2 = 2k states. That would make the options. Looking at the options, option B is 2k, which would be the answer.

Wait, but I should make sure about the transitions. Because the DFA must accept a string if both conditions are met. So, for each state in the 0's automaton, and for each state in the 1's automaton, the combined state represents the pair (a, b), where a is the count of 0's mod k, and b is the count of 1's mod 2.

Wait, but how does the automaton transition on each symbol? Let's think about the 0's automaton. Each state a (mod k) has transitions on 0's and 1's. For 0's, adding a 0 will take state a to (a+1) mod k. For 1's, adding a 0 will transition to state a (since 0's count doesn't change). Similarly for 1's: adding a 1 will flip the state (0→1, 1→0).

So, for the combined automaton, on reading a 0:

- For the 0's part, it transitions from a to (a+1) mod k.
- For the 1's part, since adding a 0 doesn't change the number of 1's, it remains in state 0 (assuming the current state is b). Or wait, no: adding a 0 doesn't change the number of 1's. So, the 1's part transitions to the same state as it was.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The 0's and 1's are separate. So, when processing the string, each step may affect either 0's or 1's count.

For the automaton, each state is a combination of (count_0 mod k, count_1 mod 2), where count_0 is the number of 0's read so far, and count_1 is the number of 1's.

When processing a new character:

- If it's a 0:
   - count_0 increases by 1, mod k. So, the 0's part transitions to (a + 1) mod k.
   - count_1 remains the same, so the 1's part transitions to b (since adding 0 doesn't add to 1's count).
   - So, the next state is (a+1) mod k, b.

- If it's a 1:
   - count_0 remains the same, so the 0's part transitions to a.
   - count_1 increases by 1, so the 1's part transitions to (b+1) mod 2.
   - So, the next state is (a, (b+1) mod 2).

So, when building the product automaton, the number of states is k * 2 = 2k.

Wait, but the initial state would be (0, 0) because initially, count_0 is 0 and count_1 is 0. Each state in the product automaton is a pair (a, b) where a is 0..k-1 and b is 0 or 1.

So, the product automaton has 2k states. So, the minimal DFA should have 2k states.

Wait, but let me check if any of the options match this. The options are:

A: k-2

B: 2k

C: k²

D: k log k

E: k² + 2

F: 2k +1

G: 2^k

H: k +2

I: k³

J: k + log k

So, option B is 2k, which matches our calculation.

Wait a moment, but I should be careful. Could there be any overlapping or simplification? For example, perhaps the 0's count being divisible by k can include the case where count_1 is odd. But the product automaton captures both conditions correctly.

Wait, another thought: the product automaton requires that both conditions are satisfied. So, for the DFA to accept, it must be in a state where count_0 mod k is 0 and count_1 mod 2 is 1.

So, the product automaton's accepting state is (0,1). So, the number of states is k * 2 = 2k.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to reduce the states. No, because each of the 0's states and 1's states are independent. Each must be tracked separately.

So, the minimal number should be 2k. So, the correct answer is B) 2k.
</think>

The problem requires constructing a DFA that recognizes strings over {0,1} where the number of 0's is divisible by \( k \) and the number of 1's is odd. 

1. **Analyzing the Conditions**:
   - The number of 0's must be divisible by \( k \), which can be modeled with an automaton having \( k \) states representing the count modulo \( k \).
   - The number of 1's must be odd, which can be modeled with an automaton having 2 states representing whether the count is even (state 0) or odd (state 1).

2. **Combining Automata**:
   - The DFA must satisfy both conditions simultaneously. This is achieved by constructing a product (interaction) automaton where each state represents a combination of the states from the two individual automata.
   - The number of states in the product automaton is the product of the number of states in each individual automaton, resulting in \( k \times 2 = 2k \) states.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The minimal number of states required for the DFA is \( 2k \), which corresponds to option B.
