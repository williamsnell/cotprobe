Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Euglena, the green flagellate protozoan. I need to figure out the right answer by understanding their locomotion, nutrition, and asexual reproduction methods.

First, I remember that Euglena is a single-celled organism. Their method of movement is probably through flagellum, like how bacteria swim. So I can probably rule out any options that say they move through pseudopodia or other mechanisms. Looking at the options, options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Let me see. Option A says moving via contracting body, which sounds more like a multicellular structure. So probably not A.

Option B: Move by flagellum, autotrophic, can switch to heterotrophic. Wait, autotrophic is for making their own food, and heterotrophic is taking in nutrients. So yes, I think E. I remember that when light is present, some can switch to autotrophic (like using their own sugars) rather than heterotrophic (which needs inorganic nutrients). So B might be correct.

Option C says moving via pseudopodia, heterotrophic. That seems off. I don't think pseudopodia are their movement method. And they are a single-celled, so movement via flagellum is more likely. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Flagellum movement, autotrophic but can't switch to heterotrophic. Wait, I thought under some conditions they can. For example, with light, they might use autotrophy because the light can help them produce their own nutrients. So D's last part is wrong. So D is probably not the correct answer.

Option E: Flagellum, chemosynthetic. I'm not sure about " chemosynthetic". I think chemosynthesis is when organisms take in oxygen, like bacteria. So maybe E is incorrect because they don't do that. Or perhaps I got the term wrong. I'll keep this in mind and look at other options.

Option F: Undulate, autotrophic, can shift under dark. Oh, wait, I think I read that under dark conditions, some flagellates might detach their flagellum and swim without it, which would be undulating instead. So F sounds plausible. So F could be a candidate. But I'm not sure if that's their primary movement method. I thought flagellum movement is the main way.

Option G: Jet propulsion, autotrophic, multiple fission. I don't recall any eukaryotes using jet propulsion. Also, multiple fission is more common in prokaryotes. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: Cilia instead of flagellum. No, Euglenas have a flagellum. Cilia are part of other organisms like Amoebae. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Gliding, autotrophic, can shift to heterotrophic without light. Gliding is another term for flagellum movement, but I think some can move via a gliding mechanism, perhaps with other structures. But I'm not too sure. Also, can they switch to heterotrophic? I thought autotrophic is more common, but under light, they might switch to autotrophy.

Option J: Flagellum, mixotrophic, binary fission type. Mixotrophic is a mix of autotrophic and heterotrophic, which I don't think is their usual state. Also, binary fission is a form of asexual reproduction. Mixotrophic sounds incorrect.

So, let's go back. The options that are left are B, F, and maybe others.

Wait, the question is about the three methods: movement, nutrition, and asexual reproduction.

Euglenas are known for being autotrophic. So their nutrition is autotrophic, meaning they make their own food. So looking for options where nutrition is autotrophic.

Option B says autotrophic nutrition and can switch to heterotrophic. That makes sense. Option F says autotrophic and can switch to heterotrophic under dark. I think under certain conditions, especially in darkness, they can detach the flagellum and move without relying on nutrients, which would be heterotrophic. So both B and F have correct nutrition. But which one is correct about their movement?

Euglenas primarily use flagellum for movement, so option B's movement method is correct. So B is about autotrophic nutrition, which is correct.

As for their reproduction, option B says asexually through cytokinesis. I think in prokaryotes, asexual reproduction is through binary fission, but sometimes it's a single-celled organism might reproduce via budding or fragmentation. Wait, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, in E. coli, asexual reproduction is typically via binary fission. But the term 'cytokinesis' is for prokaryotes' division, but for single-celled organisms, maybe it's referred to as 'fragmentation' or 'budding'. So what's the correct term for asexual reproduction in single cell organisms?

Option B says 'reproduces asexually through cytokinesis.' If cytokinesis is a term for prokaryotes, then this might not be correct for a single-celled organism. Alternatively, 'budding' is another term for asexual reproduction in single cells.

So looking at the options, B's method is correct for movement, but the reproduction method is perhaps wrong. Let me think about E. coli: they reproduce via binary fission, but for a single cell, some call it 'fragmentation'. Alternatively, some terms might refer to budding as alternative.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the options again.

Option B: Asexually through cytokinesis. If they do that, that might not be their usual method. Because I thought their main means of reproduction is through fragmentation or budding, not cytokinesis. So perhaps option B's method is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the terms in the options are correct, but perhaps my understanding is off.

Wait, another approach: I need to find the correct answer.

So the correct answer should have:

Movement: Flagellum.

Nutrition: Autotrophic.

Asexual Reproduction: Binary fission or budding.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Movement via flagellum, autotrophic, and can switch to heterotrophic. Reproduction is through cytokinesis.

Option F: Movement via undulating flagellum, autotrophic, and can switch to heterotrophic under darkness. Reproduction via longitudinal binary fission and sporulation.

Wait, but I thought E. coli reproduces via binary fission. So option B's asexual method is cytokinesis which is prokaryotic. So perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F, which says "reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission and sporulation."

Wait, but what is their primary method of asexual reproduction?

Euglenas are single-celled, so they can reproduce either by fragmentation (if the cell fragments) or via budding (if the cell has a bristle-like structure, which some do). Alternatively, they might produce spores via sporulation, which is a form of asexual reproduction.

So, if the reproduction method in the answer is "binary fission and sporulation" (which is the same as spores), that would fit.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option B: Reproduction is through cytokinesis. But for single cell organisms, that's not their usual way. So probably not correct.

Wait, but another thought: the term 'cytokinesis' is used in prokaryotes, but for single-celled eukaryotes, it's more likely to be called 'fragmentation' or 'budding'.

So perhaps option B is incorrect in the method of asexual reproduction.

Wait, but let me think of the actual known methods. I've heard that some single-celled organisms reproduce via a type of asexual method called 'budding', where the cell divides into two, each with a new cell wall. So that would fit option F's description of spore production via sporulation.

Alternatively, if the options are considering 'budding' as a term, then F's method is correct.

Wait, but the available options are:

F: moves via undulating flagellum, autotrophic, can shift to heterotrophic under dark, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission and sporulation.

Wait, if F says via binary fission and sporulation, that's the same as spore production, which is a common asexual method for single cells. So F's reproduction method is correct.

So for movement, B says flagellum, autotrophic. F says flagellum as well.

So perhaps I need to read which options are correct about nutrition. Both B and F have autotrophic, but F says they can switch to heterotrophic under dark. I'm not entirely sure about that, but I think under some light conditions, they can switch to autotrophic.

So between B and F.

What about the movement method: both have the same.

But in the options, let's see the other clues.

In the question, the last character of the answer must be the chosen letter.

So the options are A to J, and the letters are letters from A to J.

Wait, the original question lists the options as A to J, each with their own method.

So, let's see the options:

Option B: moves by flagellum, autotrophic, switch to heterotrophic under dark. Reproduction via cytokinesis.

Option F: moves by flagellum, autotrophic, can shift to heterotrophic under dark, asexually via binary fission and sporulation.

Wait, I'm not sure about the terms. Let me think about the asexual reproduction of Euglenas.

From what I recall, Euglenas are known for being a fast-swimming, single-celled organism. They can reproduce via fragmentation (breaking apart into two cells) or via budding (if they have a bristle-like or flagellum-like structure). But the term "binary fission" isn't exactly their method, but it's a form of asexual reproduction.

Wait, another term I remember for single-celled organisms is "fragmentation", which is a form of asexual reproduction. But some sources might refer to it as "cytokinesis", which is also a form of asexual reproduction. Wait, no—cytokinesis is for prokaryotes.

Wait, so perhaps the correct term is 'fragmentation', but the option says 'binary fission' or 'budding'.

So for the reproduction method, option B says 'cytokinesis' (which is incorrect), while F says 'binary fission and sporulation'. So if 'binary fission' is the correct term, F's method is correct.

So if I have to choose between B and F, let's think about the nutrition.

Option B says they switch to heterotrophic nutrition under dark. I think under some conditions, like when the light is not present, they might use autotrophic nutrition. But when light is present, perhaps they can switch to autotrophic. So option B's nutrition description is correct.

Wait, but the question says the last character of the answer must be the chosen letter. So if I pick between B and F, the last letters would be 'B' and 'F', but since the options are letters, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the answer options again.

Option B: moves by flagellum, autotrophic nutrition, can switch to heterotrophic.

Option F: same movement, autotrophic, can switch to heterotrophic under dark, and binary fission and sporulation.

I think the correct method of asexual reproduction is binary fission, not cytokinesis. So F's method is correct.

Wait, but how does that fit with the available options.

So, the correct answer should have:

Movement: flagelium.

Nutrition: autotrophic.

Reproduction: binary fission and sporulation.

Which is option F.

Wait, what about the movement method? Option B says 'moves by contracting its body', which I think is pseudopodia. But no, no, I'm wrong. I think E. coli uses flagellum, and other E. species too.

So, option B's movement method is wrong.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option B: moves via flagellum, autotrophic, can switch to heterotrophic. Reproduction via cytokinesis. So that's likely not, because single cells don't use cytokinesis. So probably not B.

Option F: moves via flagellum, autotrophic, can switch to heterotrophic under dark. Reproduction via binary fission and sporulation. That seems correct.

So the correct answer would be F.

Euglenas, the green flagellate protozoan, are single-celled organisms with specific methods of locomotion, nutrition, and asexual reproduction. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Euglenas do not move by contracting their body; they use a flagellum for swimming. This option is clearly wrong.

- **Option B**: Incorrect. While Euglenas are autotrophic (they produce their own food), their primary movement method is not through "contracting their body." Instead, they use a flagellum. Additionally, "reproduction through cytokinesis" is not their usual method; binary fission or budding is more accurate.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. Euglenas do not move through pseudopodia; their movement is primarily via flagellum. This option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. While Euglenas are autotrophic, they cannot shift to heterotrophic nutrition under certain conditions, such as when light is present. This option is misleading.

- **Option E**: Incorrect. Euglenas are not chemosynthetic; they produce their own nutrients. This option is incorrect.

- **Option F**: Correct. Euglenas move via a flagellum, are autotrophic (producing their own nutrients), and can switch to heterotrophic nutrition under dark conditions. Their asexual reproduction method is binary fission with sporulation, which is a common form of single-celled organism reproduction.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. Euglenas do not use jet propulsion; they rely on flagellum movement. This option is wrong.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. Euglenas do not have cilia or pseudopodia as part of their movement. This option is incorrect.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. Euglenas do not move via gliding along surfaces; they use a flagellum. This option is wrong.

- **Option J**: Incorrect. Euglenas are not mixotrophic; they are autotrophic. This option is wrong.

After evaluating all options, the correct answer is **Option F**, as it accurately describes the movement, nutrition, and asexual reproduction methods of Euglenas.

ANSWER: F
