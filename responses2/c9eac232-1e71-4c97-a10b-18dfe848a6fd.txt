Question:

Ricardo's theory of distribution assumed that the supply of land was fixed, while the country's population and cap-ital stock were constantly increasing. On the basis of these assumptions, he predicted eventual stagnation of the economy. How would this happen according to Ricardo?

Options:

A: The increasing population results in a surplus of land.
B: Landlords decrease rent prices to encourage more farming, leading to an economic boom.
C: The increasing population leads to increased demand for land, which eventually leads to a decline in profits, resulting in economic stagnation and decline.
D: The fixed supply of land has no impact on the economy, as technological advancements ensure sustained productivity.
E: Capital stock diminishes over time, leading to a reduction in the workforce and a stagnant economy.
F: The constant increase in capital stock leads to a technological revolution that offsets any negative effects of a fixed supply of land.
G: Landlords invest their incomes leading to economic growth.
H: The fixed supply of land leads to increased innovation in agriculture, which results in perpetual economic expansion.
I: The fixed supply of land leads to a decrease in demand.
J: The increasing population leads to a decrease in wages, which in turn increases the overall savings and investment, resulting in economic growth.

Okay, so I have this economics question here about Ricardo's theory of distribution and how it would lead to economic stagnation. Let me try to think through it step by step.

First, Ricardo's theory, I remember, was about how land is distributed between producers and landowners. He thought that the supply of land is fixed, meaning that even though the population and capital stock are increasing, the amount of land available doesn't change. So, according to Ricardo, the land is allocated between farmers and landowners because of their different impacts on the economy.

The question says Ricardo predicted eventual stagnation. So, how does his model lead to that? Let's break down the options.

Option A: The increasing population results in a surplus of land. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Ricardo said land supply is fixed, so more people wouldn't necessarily lead to more land. Maybe population doesn't directly cause land surplus. Plus, Ricardo thought land was a surplus, but I'm not sure he thought it was fixed.

Option B: Landlords decrease rent to encourage farming. Wait, if land is fixed, wouldn't the landowners have to offer higher rents? If land increases due to population, but it's fixed, maybe increased demand would make landowners pay more. But I'm not sure how that would lead to decreased rent. Or perhaps the idea is that if land is fixed, increasing population doesn't change supply, so farmers have more workers but fixed land. Maybe they can't produce as much, so they have to pay higher rent. But would that make their profits lower, leading to lower rents? Or does landowners lower their rent to compensate?

Option C: The increasing population leads to increased demand for land, which causes profits to decline. This sounds more likely. Ricardo thought that when land is fixed, more workers (capital) can't get the same return because the land is limited. So, as more people come, they have to take on more responsibility, leading to higher rent. If land is fixed, the landowners can't adjust their prices up as much because their share of the total output isn't increasing enough. So profits would fall, and farmers would save more. That would result in a decline in demand for land, leading to less profit—so economic stagnation. That makes sense.

Option D: Fixed land no impact because of tech. Ricardo thought land supply is fixed, but if tech improves, maybe productivity increases. So fixed land isn't the problem anymore. But the question says Ricardo predicted eventual stagnation, so I think the issue is demand. If land were fixed, increasing population would cause increasing demand for land, which Ricardo thought would make landowners earn less, leading to lower profits, hence stagnation. So D might not be the right answer.

Option E: Capital stock diminishes, workforce shrinks, economy stagnates. If the population is increasing, and if capital stock is fixed and the workforce doesn't grow, that would lead to fewer workers. But Ricardo's model suggests that the land is fixed, so workers (capital) can't keep up with the demand. So if workers are fixed, their production doesn't increase, leading to a decline in output. Thus, fixed land and fixed capital would mean lower productivity, leading to economic stagnation. So E could be a possibility, but I think Ricardo focused more on the land's fixed supply.

Option F: Capital stock increases due to tech, offsetting land. Ricardo said land is fixed, so if tech improves, maybe productivity goes up. So land isn't the limiting factor anymore. But the question is about the fixed land scenario, so F likely isn't correct.

Option G: Landlords invest, causing expansion. If land is fixed, farmers would have to deal with less land—but Ricardo thought land was fixed, so that wouldn't be the case. It's about the distribution of land, not expansion of land.

Option H: Land fixed, so population increase leads to lower demand. That rings a bell. Ricardo said land is a surplus, and fixed supply would mean that as population increases, farmers have to share the same land, leading to higher rents. But if land isn't increasing, as in Ricardo's model, then farmers have to accept higher prices. That would lower their profits, leading them to save more. Eventually, this would cause a decline in demand for land, hence less profit, leading to stagnation.

Option I: Fixed land leads to lower demand. So as population increases, more people come to the land, and since land is fixed, more demand, leading to lower prices. So lower demand, which reduces the price of land, thus lower profits for farmers. That sounds right.

Option J: Population increase leads to lower wages, which increases savings and investment, leading to growth. Wait, that seems conflicting with Ricardo's theory. Ricardo thought land was fixed, so more workers can't get higher returns. If labor (capital) increases, but land is fixed, that would mean each worker is taking on more responsibility. So their share of the output increases, leading to higher profits. So J is incorrect because Ricardo thought land supply was fixed, thus people couldn't get higher returns.

So going back, options C and I are possibilities. Let's think about Ricardo's model. He thought land was a surplus, so fixed land would mean that as more people come, the land supply is limited. So landowners would have to charge higher rent. If land increases in supply (but in this question, the supply is fixed), so the increase in population would mean more demand for land, but land can't be more. So landowners can't charge higher because land is fixed. So as more workers come, land is fixed, so their share is lower, leading to lower profits. That would cause them to save more, leading to less investment. Thus, the economy would stagnate.

So in Ricardo's model, fixed land leads to higher demand for land, leading to lower rents, which reduces profits, so less investment and savings. So the economy would stagnate, not grow.

Which option corresponds to that? Option C says the increasing population leads to increased demand for land, which causes profits to decline. That's correct.

Option I says fixed land leads to lower demand, which reduces wages and investment, which seems conflicting.

Wait, in option I, "fixed land leads to lower demand." So if land is fixed, more people can't get more land. So demand for land would be lower. But land is fixed, so if demand is lower, prices would go down. So farmers have to pay lower, which would lower their profits. So yes, that's correct.

So both options C and I seem to describe scenarios where demand for land increases, leading to profits decline. But wait, in reality, Ricardo's model would predict that the land is fixed, so the demand for land would increase as population increases, but land can't be more. So landowners have to lower their prices, thus profit declines. That would lead to lower prices, less demand, perhaps. So the land would get less used, leading to fewer farmers, less production, and thus, less revenue. So maybe that's a decline in demand for land, not an increase.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Ricardo's model where land is fixed: if the population increases, more workers come, but land is fixed. So each worker is doing more work, but land can't be more. So their contribution to the total output increases, but each individual's contribution is less.

So if the total output increases with more workers, but each worker's share is fixed (since land is fixed), their individual profit (rent) would go down. So the landowners would have to lower their prices to accommodate the higher demand. Lower prices would lead to lower profits, so farmers save more.

In that case, the demand for land would increase (more people want to use it) but the supply is fixed. So the price of land would rise, but that's not what Ricardo said. Instead, Ricardo thought that the land supply was fixed, so when more people come, landowners have to lower their prices to make up for the increased demand. So land demand increases, but the land price also goes up, but that's contrary to Ricardo's model. Wait, no. Ricardo thought land was a surplus, so fixed supply. In this question, the supply is fixed, so the demand would be higher, leading to higher prices, but with fixed land, that can't happen. So landowners can't increase their share because land isn't more. So the land price has to go up as more workers come, but since land is fixed, each worker's share is lower.

Alternatively, maybe Ricardo thought that land is a surplus, so more workers can get more land, but in this question, the land is fixed, so more workers mean less land per person, leading to lower profits.

I think that in Ricardo's model, the fixed land leads to higher demand for workers, which might not work because land is fixed. So the land is a surplus, so more workers can have more land. But in this question, land is fixed, so more workers would have to share the same land, meaning less profit per worker. Thus, Ricardo would predict that the economy would stagnate because the land is fixed, and as more workers come, their share can't increase enough.

So the correct answer would be C: the increasing population leads to increased demand for land, which eventually causes demand to decline because land is fixed, leading to profits decline.

Wait, but option I says fixed land causes lower demand, leading to lower wages and more savings. That would fit because if demand for land is lower, landowners pay lower, profits go down, savings increase, less investment—so the economy doesn't grow.

So which option is correct? The question is about how Ricardo predicted economic stagnation. According to Ricardo, the conclusion is that with fixed land, more workers come, but they can't get higher profits, so landowners have to lower their prices, which leads to lower profits and less investment. So the economy stalls.

So the correct option is C: increased demand for land leads to decreased profits, leading to economic stagnation.

Ricardo's theory of distribution posits that the supply of land is fixed, while the economy's population and capital stock continuously increase. According to Ricardo, this scenario would lead to eventual stagnation. Ricardo argued that land is a surplus, meaning that even as the population and capital stock grow, the amount of land available remains unchanged. As a result, more workers would have to share the land, reducing their individual profits. This decline in individual profits would force landowners to lower their prices, leading to lower rents. Consequently, the demand for land would increase, but the fixed supply would eventually cause profit declines, reducing savings and investment. This decline in demand for land would eventually lead to a stagnation of the economy.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. Ricardo did not suggest that increasing population leads to a surplus of land.
- **B**: Incorrect. Landlords would not decrease rent to encourage farming in this scenario because Ricardo assumed land was a fixed surplus.
- **C**: Correct. The increasing population leads to an increased demand for land, which causes profits to decline due to fixed supply, resulting in economic stagnation.
- **D**: Incorrect. Ricardo's model did not suggest that fixed land would have no impact on the economy; instead, it would lead to declining profits and savings.
- **E**: Incorrect. Capital stock diminishing would not explain the fixed land scenario.
- **F**: Incorrect. Ricardo did not propose technological advancements as a solution to fixed land.
- **G**: Incorrect. Ricardo focused on land distribution, not land investment.
- **H**: Incorrect. Landowners would not invest if land is fixed because their share of the output would decrease.
- **I**: Incorrect. Fixed land would not lead to lower demand; demand would increase, causing profits to decline.
- **J**: Incorrect. Ricardo did not predict lower wages leading to increased savings and investment.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately reflects Ricardo's reasoning that fixed land leads to increased demand for land, declining profits, and economic stagnation.
