Okay, so I've got this question about group theory, which I know a bit about but need to think through carefully. Let's break it down step by step.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I need to determine the truth value of each. Then, I'll match them to the options A to J, where each option pairs the truth values of Statement 1 and Statement 2.

Starting with Statement 1: "If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5." Hmm. I remember that in group theory, the order of an element (the smallest positive integer m such that g^m = e) must divide the order of the group (Lagrange's theorem). So, if there's an element of order 10, the group itself must have order divisible by 10.

Now, for Statement 1, the group must have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. The order 1 element is the identity element, so that's always there. For orders 2 and 5, those are prime factors of 10. So, does the existence of an element of order 10 imply the existence of elements of order 2 and 5?

Well, in a cyclic group, the elements' orders correspond to the divisors of the group's order. So, if the group is cyclic, it's generated by a single element, and the orders of elements are the divisors of the group order. So, if there's an element of order 10, the group must have an order that is a multiple of 10. Let's say the group's order is 10 for simplicity. Then, the group is cyclic, and it has elements of order 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, Statement 1 holds true in this case.

But wait, the group could be non-cyclic as well. Let's think about the smallest non-cyclic group with order 10, which is the dihedral group D10 (or sometimes denoted as D5, but I might get that mixed up). D10 has elements of order 2 and 5, but does it have elements of order 10? No, because the dihedral group of order 10 has 10 elements, and the maximum order of an element is the highest order of the rotations. For a regular polygon with 5 sides, the rotations have orders that are divisors of 5, which are 1 and 5. So, the dihedral group D5 (order 10) doesn't have an element of order 10. Wait, but D5 would have elements of order 2, right? Because flipping (a reflection) is an element of order 2. So, in D5: elements are rotations by 0, 72, 144, 216, and 288 degrees (which is 2*180, so order 5), and the reflections. Reflections are order 2 because reflecting twice brings you back. So, yes, D5 has elements of order 2 and 5, but no element of order 10. So, Statement 1 would be false in this case.

Wait, but wait—am I considering the correct group structure? Let me think again. For a group of order 10, if it's cyclic, then it has elements of order 10, 5, 2, and 1. So, Statement 1 would be true in a cyclic group, but false in a non-cyclic group of order 10. So, the statement says "If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5." But that's not necessarily the case because the group could be non-cyclic. So, the implication is not always true. So, Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. What's the key point here? The group must have an element of order 10. Does that imply that the group must have elements of order 2 and 5?

Yes, because 10 is the least common multiple of 2 and 5. So, if an element has order 10, then by Cauchy's theorem, the group must have elements of orders 2 and 5. Because 2 and 5 divide 10, and they are both primes. So, I think Statement 1 is true. Wait, but earlier I thought about the dihedral group D5 (order 10) and thought it doesn't have elements of order 10, but it does have elements of order 2 and 5. So, the group must have an element of order 10 only if it has elements of orders 2 and 5. So, Statement 1 is correct.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about the converse. If a group has elements of orders 2 and 5, does it necessarily have an element of order 10? Yes, because 2 and 5 are coprime. So, by the fundamental theorem of cyclic groups, if a group has elements of orders m and n where m and n are coprime, then the group is cyclic. So the group must have an element of order lcm(2,5)=10. So, the group must have an element of order 10.

Wait, but wait! That would suggest that any group that has elements of order 2 and 5 must have an element of order 10. So, Statement 1 is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the dihedral group D10 (order 10) and thought it didn't have an element of order 10. But perhaps I made a mistake in that. Let me re-examine the dihedral group D5. Oh wait, no, D10 is of order 20. Wait, maybe I confused the notation.

Let me clarify: D10 would have order 20, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me instead think of a group of order 10. For example, the cyclic group Z10. It has elements of order 10 (the generator), 5 (the element of order 2, since 5*2=10 mod 10 is 0), 2 (since 5*2=10=0 mod 10), and 1 for the identity. So, yes, Statement 1 holds.

But wait, what about a non-cyclic group of order 10? That's the dihedral group D5, which has order 10. But wait, D5 is of order 10, but according to Cauchy's theorem, since 2 and 5 are primes dividing 10, the group must have elements of orders 2 and 5. So, D5 has elements of order 2 and 5, but does it have an element of order 10? No, because the highest order of any element in D5 is 5 (the rotations by 72 and 288 degrees are order 5, and the reflections are order 2). So, in D5, the group doesn't have an element of order 10. But wait, if the group is of order 10, then D5 is a possible group of order 10. So, if the group is D5, then Statement 1 is false because it has elements of order 2 and 5, but no element of order 10.

Wait, but does D5 have an element of order 10? No, because the order of an element is the minimal m where g^m=e. In D5, the rotational elements have order dividing 5, and the reflections have order 2. So, the maximal order is 5. So, the group D5 of order 10 doesn't have an element of order 10. Therefore, Statement 1 is false because the premise could be true (group has element of order 10), but the conclusion is not necessarily true. So the implication is False.

Wait, but wait again. Let me re-examine Statement 1's wording: "If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5."

So, the group has order 10, and by Cauchy's theorem, it must have elements of orders 2 and 5. So, the group must have elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, Statement 1 is correct. Because if a group has an element of order 10, then it must have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. Because 10 is 2*5, and 2 and 5 are coprime. So, in any group, if there's an element of order 10, then the group is cyclic, hence has all possible divisors of 10 as element orders. So, the group must have elements of order 1, 2, 5, and 10.

Wait, but wait, that's not entirely accurate. Wait, in a cyclic group of order 10, the elements are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 (mod 10). The element 5 has order 2, because 5+5=10=0 mod 10. The element 2 has order 5 because 2*5=10=0 mod 10. The element 1 has order 10. So, the group does have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.

But wait, if the group is non-cyclic, like D5, which is order 10, but not cyclic, then it doesn't have an element of order 10. But wait, D5 is not cyclic. So, in that case, the premise is true (has an element of order 10), but the conclusion is false (no element of order 10). So, Statement 1 is false. Because the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. So, the implication is False.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. So which one is correct?

Let me think again. If a group has an element of order 10, it must be cyclic, because the order of the group is the least common multiple of the element orders, and if that's 10, the group is cyclic. So, in a group of order 10, if an element has order 10, the group is cyclic, which means it has elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, the group must have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. So, Statement 1 is true.

But earlier, I thought about D5 (order 10) and thought it doesn't have an element of order 10, which is correct. But that would mean that in D5, the group has elements of order 2 and 5, but not 10. So, the premise is true (has elements of order 10), but the conclusion is false (doesn't have elements of order 10). So, the implication is false.

Wait, but D5 is of order 10. Wait, no, D5 is of order 10? No, D5 would have order 2*5=10. So, yes. So, in D5, the group is of order 10, which is the same as the cyclic group of order 10. So, if the group is cyclic, the premise holds (has elements of order 10), and the group must have elements of orders 1,2,5,10. So, Statement 1 is true.

But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought that D5 doesn't have an element of order 10. So, perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me clarify: In D5, the element of order 10 is the same as the cyclic group's element, right? Because in D5, the rotational elements (rotations by 72 and 288 degrees) have order 5, and the reflections have order 2. So, the rotational elements have order 5, so no element of order 10. So, D5 isn't cyclic, but it's of order 10.

Wait, but that's a problem because in D5, the group is of order 10 and has an element of order 5. So, by Cauchy's theorem, it must have elements of orders 2 and 5. But in D5, the element of order 5 is the rotational element, which is there, and the reflections have order 2.

Wait, so if the group is D5, which is of order 10, and has an element of order 5 (a rotation), then by Cauchy's theorem, it must have elements of order 2 and 5. So, the group has elements of orders 1, 2, 5. So, the premise is true, and the conclusion is true. So, Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but earlier I thought that D5 doesn't have an element of order 10, which was incorrect. Because the order of an element is the minimal m where g^m=e. In the dihedral group D5, the rotational elements have order 5, and reflections have order 2. So, the maximum order is 5. So, the group has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. So, the conclusion is true.

Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but wait, what's the mistake I made earlier? I thought D5 doesn't have an element of order 10, but that's incorrect. Because the order of each element in D5 is either 2 or 5. So, the group has elements of order 1, 2, and 5. So, Statement 1 is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in a non-cyclic group of order 10, like D5, the element of order 10 isn't present, but no, the element of order 10 is the same as the cyclic group's element, which is present. So, the group is cyclic, hence the conclusion holds.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused, but I think I need to clarify. Okay, let's make it clear: If a group G has an element of order 10, then the order of G is 10, and by Cauchy's theorem, G must have elements of order 2 and 5 because 2 and 5 divide 10. So, G must have elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, Statement 1 is true.

So, Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: "If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6."

This seems to involve the least common multiple. If a group has elements of order 2 and 3, which are coprime, then the group must have an element of order 6, as per Lagrange's theorem and the structure of cyclic groups.

Wait, but the group might not be cyclic. For example, consider the symmetric group S3. It has elements of order 2 (the transpositions) and order 3 (the 3-cycles). But does it have an element of order 6? No. Because the order of S3 is 6, so any element must divide 6. The possible orders are 1, 2, 3, and 6. So, S3 has elements of order 1, 2, 3, but no element of order 6 because 6 is the group order, so the maximum order is 3 (the 3-cycles have order 3). So, in this case, the group has elements of order 2 and 3, but no element of order 6. So, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another point: the group might be non-abelian. Does that affect the implication? No, because even a non-abelian group can have elements of order 2 and 3. For example, in S3, which is non-abelian, the elements of order 2 and 3 are present, but there's no element of order 6. So, Statement 2's conclusion isn't necessarily true.

Alternatively, perhaps the group is cyclic. If the group is cyclic, then the conclusion holds. But the statement doesn't specify that the group is cyclic. It just says "a group" that has elements of order 2 and 3. If the group is non-cyclic, like S3, then it doesn't have an element of order 6.

Wait, but in S3, the order is 6, and the possible element orders are 1, 2, 3, and 6. No, wait, wait, no. Oh wait, no, no. In S3, the elements have orders 1, 2, 3, and 3 again. Because the 3-cycles have order 3, and the transpositions have order 2. So, no element of order 6 because the group has order 6. So, Statement 2 is false.

So, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but wait! Wait, no—no, wait. I think I made a mistake in the group order. The group in Statement 2 must have elements of order 2 and 3, but the group's order must be a multiple of both. So the group must have an order that is a multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6. So, the group must have order 6 or a multiple thereof.

If the group is of order 6, then it's either cyclic (so has elements of order 6) or the symmetric group S3, which is non-cyclic and has elements of order 2 and 3 but no element of order 6.

Wait, but if the group is cyclic of order 6 (like Z6), then it has elements of order 2 and 3, and the element of order 6 exists. So, Statement 2 would be true for cyclic groups of order 6, but false for non-cyclic groups of order 6 (like S3).

So, the statement is "If a group has elements of order 2 and 3, then it has an element of order 6." So, the condition is that the group must have elements of orders 2 and 3. But the group could be of order 6, which has an element of order 6 only if it's cyclic. Otherwise, it doesn't.

Wait, but the group could be of higher order. For example, take the cyclic group Z12. It has elements of order 2 (6), 3 (4), and 1. So, the group would have elements of order 2 and 3, and an element of order 6. So, in that case, the conclusion holds.

But if the group is of order 6 and non-cyclic (like S3), then it doesn't have an element of order 6. So, the implication is not always true. So, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but the group in Statement 2 could be of order 6. So, the group must have elements of order 2 and 3, which implies that the group's order is a multiple of both, so 6 or higher. But the group could be of order 6 and non-cyclic. So, the group's order is 6, and the group is S3, which has elements of order 2 and 3 but no element of order 6. So, the implication is false.

So, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Statement 1 was false because in a non-cyclic group of order 10, the group doesn't have an element of order 10. But that's incorrect because the group is cyclic of order 10, which does have an element of order 10. Wait, no, the group in Statement 1 is of order 10, but if it's cyclic, it has elements of order 10. But the group could be non-cyclic of order 10, but that's impossible because a group of order 10 must be cyclic. Because the order is 10, which is the product of two primes, so the group must be cyclic. So, any group of order 10 has an element of order 10, and thus, by Cauchy's theorem, it must have elements of order 2 and 5. So, Statement 1 is True.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me try to summarize:

Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has an element of order 6.

- Group of order 10 must be cyclic because 10 is 2*5, which are primes.
- Cyclic group of order 10 has elements of order 1, 2, 5, and 10.
- So, the group has elements of order 1, 2, and 5, but does it have an element of order 6? No, because 6 is not a divisor of 10. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, no—no, wait. If the group is cyclic of order 10, then it doesn't have an element of order 6. So, Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but that's a contradiction. Earlier, I thought that in a cyclic group of order 10, the conclusion holds. But now, I'm thinking that the conclusion doesn't hold. Wait, no, 6 is not a divisor of 10. So, the group cannot have an element of order 6. So, in that case, the implication is false.

Wait, but that can't be right because Statement 1 says that if there's an element of order 10, then the group must have elements of order 1, 2, and 6. Because 10 is the LCM of 2 and 5, which are the orders of the elements. Hmm, perhaps my confusion arises from the fact that 10 is the order, not the LCM.

Wait, no, the element of order 10 is part of the group, but 6 is not a divisor of 10. So, the group can't have an element of order 6. So, the implication is false.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me think of it this way: If a group has an element of order 10, then by the structure of groups, the group must have elements of order 2 and 5. But 6 is not a divisor of 10, so the group cannot have an element of order 6. So, Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but then earlier I thought that in a cyclic group of order 10, the group must have elements of order 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, it must have elements of order 1, 2, and 5, but no element of order 6. So, the implication is false.

So, Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier conclusion. I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to wrap this up.

Final conclusion:

Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.

But wait, according to the group theory, a group of order 10 must be cyclic, so it must have elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, the group has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. So, the implication is true.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in a group of order 10, which is cyclic, it doesn't have an element of order 6. So, the implication is true because the premises are true and the conclusion is true.

Wait, but that's a contradiction. So, perhaps the confusion is about the group's order.

Wait, the mistake is in the assumption that a group of order 10 must have an element of order 6. But 6 is not a divisor of 10, so the group cannot have an element of order 6. So, the implication is true because the group must have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5, but not 6. So, the statement is true.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. I think I need to clarify again.

Let me think of the group as follows: if the group has an element of order 10, then the group's order is 10. If the group is cyclic, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. If the group is non-cyclic, it's impossible because the order has to be 10. So, the group must be cyclic. So, the group must have elements of orders 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, the implication is true.

So, Statement 1 is True.

Now, Statement 2: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.

In a group, if there are elements of order 2 and 3 (which are coprime), then the group must have an element of order 6. Because the group's order must be a multiple of both 2 and 3, so the order is at least 6. So, for example, in the symmetric group S3, which is of order 6, the elements are of order 1, 2, 3, and 6. Wait, no, actually, S3 has elements of order 1, 2, and 3, but no element of order 6. Because the group order is 6, and the maximum order of any element is 3. So, S3 is of order 6, and it's non-cyclic. So, it has elements of order 2 and 3, but no element of order 6.

Therefore, Statement 2 is False.

Wait, but the group's order is 6, which is the LCM of 2 and 3. So, according to Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, and 6. So, an element of order 6 must exist. But S3 doesn't. So, the group must have elements of order 2 and 3, but not order 6.

Wait, so the implication is false. Because the group has elements of order 2 and 3, but no element of order 6.

Alternatively, if the group's order is a multiple of 6, like 12, then it could have elements of order 6.

But the question doesn't specify the group's order. It just says, "if a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3." So, the group could be of order 6 or higher.

Wait, but if the group is of order 6, as in S3, then it has elements of order 2 and 3, but no element of order 6. So, the implication is false.

If the group is of order 12, then it could have elements of order 6.

But the question is phrased as "if a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6." So, the "if" part is about groups that have elements of order 2 and 3, and the "then" part is about having an element of order 6. So, in the S3 case, the "if" part is true (has elements of order 2 and 3), but the "then" part is false (no element of order 6). So, the implication is false.

Thus, Statement 2 is False.

So, to recap:

Statement 1: True.

Statement 2: False.

So, the correct answer is A: True and False.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me make it clear again.

Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 10, then it must have elements of order 1, 2, and 5.

But in a group of order 10 (which is cyclic), it must have elements of order 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, it must have elements of order 1, 2, and 5. So, the implication is true.

Statement 2: If a group has elements of order 2 and 3, then it must have an element of order 6.

In a group of order 6 (like S3), it has elements of order 2 and 3, but no element of order 6. So, the implication is false.

So, Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
</think>

Now, let's break it down step by step:

### Analysis of Statement 1:
- **Statement 1**: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has an element of order 6.
- **Group of Order 10**: The only group of order 10 is the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_{10} \) because 10 is the product of two primes (2 and 5). In a cyclic group, the order of an element must divide the group order. Therefore, the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_{10} \) must have elements of order 1, 2, 5, and 10.
- **Conclusion**: Since the group has elements of order 2 and 5, it must have elements of order 1, 2, and 5. It does not necessarily have an element of order 6 because 6 is not a divisor of 10. Therefore, the statement is **True**.

### Analysis of Statement 2:
- **Statement 2**: If a group has elements of order 2 and 3, then it has an element of order 6.
- **Group Consideration**: If the group has elements of order 2 and 3, the group's order must be a multiple of both 2 and 3. The smallest such order is 6. However, a group of order 6 (like the symmetric group \( S_3 \)) does not necessarily have an element of order 6. In \( S_3 \), the elements have orders 1, 2, and 3, but no element of order 6.
- **Conclusion**: The statement is **False** because the group of order 6 (like \( S_3 \)) does not have an element of order 6.

### Final Answer:
- Statement 1 is **True**.
- Statement 2 is **False**.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
