Question:

Explain the mechanism of the genetic determination of sex in humans.

Options:

A: The presence of two X chromosomes in the absence of a Y chromosome has no impact on the sex of an individual.
B: The number of autosomes determines the sex of an individual.
C: The sex of an individual is determined by the number of X chromosomes, irrespective of the Y chromosome.
D: The combination of two Y chromosomes determines that an individual will be female.
E: The presence of an X chromosome and an additional chromosome other than Y determines that an individual will be male.
F: Environmental factors determine the genetic sex of an individual.
G: The presence of the X chromosome determines that an individual will be male.
H: The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male.
I: The process of meiosis determines the sex of an individual.
J: The total number of chromosomes in an individual dictates their sex.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about the genetic determination of sex in humans. Let me start by recalling what I remember from my biology classes.

Hmm, I think in humans, the sex of a person is determined by the sex chromosomes they have. Oh right, humans have two sex chromosomes: one is an X and the other is a Y. So the number of these chromosomes matters a lot.

Wait, so if someone has an X chromosome, they're male. And if they have a Y, they're female. But wait, wait, isn't it that if you have two X's, you're male, and two Y's, you're female? Oh, because in humans, males have one X and one Y chromosome. So the presence of an X determines male, Y determines female.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: The presence of two X chromosomes (without a Y) affects sex. Wait, wait, no. Because I think having two Xs is male, but what if someone has two Ys? Oh, no, that's not possible because males can't have two Ys. So option A might not be correct because having two Xs would make a male, but if there's a Y, it's a different case. Wait, but the question is about the mechanism. Oh, the presence of an X chromosome determines male, Y determines female. So option G says the presence of an X determines male. That sounds correct.

Option B: The number of autosomes determines sex. I think autosomes are the ones other than sex chromosomes. So the number of autosomes doesn't directly determine sex. It's more about the combination of X and Y. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: The sex is determined by the number of X, regardless of Y. That's similar to B, but same reasoning. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Two Ys determine male. That's wrong because two Y's are female. So D is incorrect.

Option E: X and another (non-Y) chromosome make male. Wait, but if you have an X and another chromosome, what's the other? If it's another X, then you have two Xs (male). If it's a Y, then male and female (like X and Y gives male). Wait, but if someone has an X and a Y, they're male. So E says that if there's an X and another chromosome (non-Y), then male. Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Because if the other is a Y, then it's male. If it's another X, then it's also male. So E is a bit tricky. Because it's not entirely accurate to say that. The presence of an X and another chromosome other than Y is required for being male. So E might not be the right answer, but I'm not sure.

Option F: Environmental factors determine sex. No, that's not right. It's genetic, not environmental.

Option G: Presence of X determines male. Yes, that's correct.

Option H: Y determines male. No, that's the opposite. Y determines female.

Option I: Meiosis determines sex. Not sure, but meiosis is a process, and the sex is determined by the outcome. But I think the main factor is the presence/absence of Y chromosomes, not meiosis. So I'm not sure, but perhaps it's not the primary mechanism.

Option J: Total number of chromosomes dictates sex. Wait, humans have 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs. So if it's 46, it's female or male? Wait, no. Wait, all females have 46, males have 46 (since they have two Xs and two Ys). So the total number is same. So J says total number of chromosomes determine sex. That's incorrect because the presence of Ys decides sex regardless of the total.

Wait wait, but in humans, the sex is determined by the presence of Y chromosomes. So J's statement is incorrect because the total number is same for both genders.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer must be one of the options.

Let me look back at the options again.

Looking for the option that says the presence of an X determines male. That's option G.

Wait, option G says: The presence of the X chromosome determines that an individual will be male. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

The correct answer is G: The presence of the X chromosome determines that an individual will be male.

**Explanation:** The genetic determination of sex in humans is regulated by the presence of sex chromosomes. Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, making them male, while females have two X chromosomes, making them female. The presence of an X chromosome specifically determines an individual's male gender, while the presence of a Y chromosome determines female. 

Other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the genetic basis of sex determination (e.g., incorrect roles of X and Y chromosomes) or confuse genetic and environmental factors. For instance, option E incorrectly implies that having an X and another chromosome (non-Y) exclusively determines male sex, which is not the case as the other chromosome could be a Y (resulting in male) or an X (also resulting in male). Option J is incorrect because the total number of chromosomes does not determine sex; it is the combination of X and Y chromosomes that does.
