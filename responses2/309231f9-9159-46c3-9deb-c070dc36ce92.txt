Okay, so I've got this optimization problem here. The question is asking for the minimum value of the expression x + 4z as a function on R^3, but it's subject to the constraint that x² + y² + z² ≤ 2. Hmm, that's an inequality, so the function is defined on the region inside or on the sphere of radius sqrt(2).

I remember that for optimization problems with constraints, especially involving spheres, Lagrange multipliers might be useful. But wait, since it's asking for the minimum, maybe I can approach it using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let me think about how that works.

The expression x + 4z can be seen as the dot product of two vectors: (x, y, z) and (1, 0, 4). The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that the absolute value of their dot product is less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes. So, |x*1 + y*0 + z*4| ≤ sqrt(1² + 0² + 4²) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²). That simplifies to |x + 4z| ≤ sqrt(17) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²).

But the constraint is x² + y² + z² ≤ 2. So substituting that in, we get |x +4z| ≤ sqrt(17) * sqrt(2) = sqrt(34). Wait, but we're looking for the minimum, so the minimal value would be when x +4z is as small as possible. That would be the negative of the maximum, so -sqrt(34). 

Wait, but let me double-check. The Cauchy-Schwarz gives the maximum of the dot product, so the minimum would be the negative of that maximum. So yes, the minimal value should be -sqrt(34). Looking back at the options, option E is -sqrt(34). So the answer should be E.

Alternatively, using Lagrange multipliers: the gradients should be proportional. The gradient of x +4z is (1, 0, 4), and the gradient of the constraint function f(x,y,z)=x² + y² + z² - 2 is (2x, 2y, 2z). Setting them proportional gives 1 = 2λx, 0 = 2λy, 4 = 2λz. From the second equation, 0 = 2λy implies y=0. From the first, 1=2λx => λ=1/(2x). From the third, 4=2λz => λ=2/(z). So setting the two expressions for λ equal: 1/(2x) = 2/z => z = 4x. 

Now, substituting into the constraint equation: x² + y² + z² = x² + (4x)^2 = x² + 16x² = 17x² = 2. So x² = 2/17, so x = sqrt(2/17) or x = -sqrt(2/17). Since we're looking for the minimal value of x + 4z, which is x + 4*(4x) = x + 16x = 17x. Choosing x negative would give the minimal value. So x = -sqrt(2/17), so 17x = 17*(-sqrt(2/17)) )= -sqrt(34), confirming the earlier result. So the minimal value is indeed -sqrt(34), which is option E.

The minimal value of x + 4z under the given constraint is found using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or Lagrange multipliers. Both methods confirm that the minimal value is -sqrt(34), which is option E.

Answer: E
