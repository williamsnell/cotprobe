Question:

Mr. Jones is president of the First National Bank of St. Louis and wishes to determine if his bank is holding too much of its demand deposits as reserves. The bank's total deposits = $1,700,000 and the reserve ratio is 20%. If Mr. Jones finds that reserves = $850,000 what might he conclude about excess reserves?

Options:

A: $340,000
B: $600,000
C: $425,000
D: 25%
E: 10%
F: $510,000
G: $1,700,000
H: 30%
I: $255,000
J: 15%

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about excess reserves. Let's see what the question says. Mr. Jones is the president of the First National Bank, and he wants to know if his bank is holding too much as reserves. The bank's total deposits are $1,700,000, and the reserve ratio is 20%. He found that the reserves are $850,000. I need to find out what he might conclude about excess reserves.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that the bank is required to hold as reserves. So, the bank's required reserves would be the reserve ratio multiplied by the total deposits. Let me calculate that.

Reserve ratio is 20%, so that's 0.20 in decimal. Total deposits are $1,700,000. So required reserves = 0.20 * 1,700,000. Let's compute that: 0.20 times 1,700,000 is $340,000. That's the required reserves.

Now, the bank currently holds $850,000 in reserves. So, to find excess reserves, I subtract the required reserves from the total reserves. So, excess reserves = $850,000 - $340,000.

Wait, 850,000 minus 340,000. Let me do that subtraction. Hmm, 850,000 minus 340,000 is 510,000. So excess reserves would be $510,000.

Looking at the options, option F is $510,000. So, that must be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way to think: if the reserve ratio is 20%, the bank is holding 20% in reserves, so the rest is excess. But in this case, the reserves are $850k, which is more than the required 340k. So the excess is 850k - 340k = 510k. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thing: sometimes, when calculating, we use the formula: Excess Reserves = Reserves - (Reserve Ratio * Total Deposits). So plugging in the numbers: 850,000 - (0.2 * 1,700,000) → 850,000 - 340,000 = 510,000. Yep, that's correct.

So the excess is $510,000, which is option F.

To determine the excess reserves, we first calculate the required reserves using the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is 20%, and the total deposits are $1,700,000. 

**Required Reserves = Reserve Ratio × Total Deposits = 0.20 × 1,700,000 = $340,000**

The bank holds $850,000 in reserves. 

**Excess Reserves = Total Reserves - Required Reserves = $850,000 - $340,000 = $510,000**

Thus, the excess reserves are $510,000. The correct answer is **F: $510,000**.

Answer: F
