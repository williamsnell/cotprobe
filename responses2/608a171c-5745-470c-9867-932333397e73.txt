Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the motion of a uniform sphere. The question asks me to use the Euler equations to find the equation of motion. The options are A through J. Let's see.

So, the sphere is uniform, which means its moment of inertia I₁, I₂, I₃ are all equal. Wait, no, the question says I₁ = I₂ = I₃, so they are the same. That probably means it's a solid sphere, right? Because for a solid sphere, the moment of inertia about any axis through the center is (2/5)MR². So, if all three moments of inertia are the same, it's definitely a solid sphere.

Euler's equations are about rotational motion. I remember Euler's equations in the case of a rigid body. They are torque equals I times the angular acceleration for each axis, but I think in the case of a symmetric top, things simplify. Wait, but a solid sphere is symmetric in all axes, so maybe it's different from a typical top.

Wait, the question says "uniform sphere", so it's a solid sphere. So, when a solid sphere rotates, the moment of inertia is the same for any axis. So the Euler equations apply.

I think the Euler equations for rotation about a fixed point are given by a certain set of equations. Let me recall. Euler's equations are:

I₁ dω₁/dt + (I₂ - I₃) ω₂ × ω₃ = τ₁
I₂ dω₂/dt + (I₃ - I₁) ω₃ × ω₁ = τ₂
I₃ dω₃/dt + (I₁ - I₂) ω₂ × ω₁ = τ₃

But for a solid sphere, I₁=I₂=I₃. So, all I's are the same. So substituting, the equations become:

I dω₁/dt + 0 = τ₁
I dω₂/dt + 0 = τ₂
I dω₃/dt + 0 = τ₃

Wait, because (I₂ - I₃)=0, and same for others. So, the equations simplify to each torque being equal to the I times the angular acceleration. So each of the three equations is τ = I * dω/dt.

But wait, the torque τ is the time derivative of angular momentum, right? So, τ = dL/dt. The angular momentum L for a solid sphere is I ω, because L = I ω for rotation about a fixed axis. So dL/dt = I dω/dt.

So, if the torque is τ = I (dω/dt), then each Euler equation simplifies to that. So, for each axis, the torque is equal to the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration.

But wait, torque depends on the point of application. If the sphere is rotating about a fixed point, then the torque would be zero because the point is the same, so there's no net torque. Wait, when a solid sphere is rotating about a fixed point, like how a top spins, the torque is zero because the line of action of the torque passes through the point. So, in that case, the torque is zero. So, all the derivatives of ω would be zero. So, ω is constant.

Wait, but the question says it's a uniform sphere, so what's the scenario here? Are they rotating about a point, or about an axis through the center? The question doesn't specify, but I think the Euler equations for a fixed point would apply if the sphere is rotating about a fixed point, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. If the sphere is rotating about a fixed point, then the torque would be zero because all the mass is attached to that point. So, the derivatives of angular velocity would be zero. So, ω would be a constant vector. So, equation of motion would be dω/dt = 0 → ω is constant.

But wait, the question is about the equation of motion. Alternatively, if the sphere is spinning about its center, then torque is non-zero, and Euler equations would apply.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the scenario. The question is about a uniform sphere. So, when it's rotating about any axis, the moment of inertia is the same. So, in Euler's equations, all the derivatives would be zero.

Wait, but Euler's equations for a fixed point would give zero torque. So, each derivative is zero. So, ω is constant. So, equation of motion is dω/dt = 0, so ω is constant.

So, looking at the options. Option A is ω=const. That would be the case if the sphere is rotating about a fixed point. But the question doesn't specify, so maybe that's the case.

Wait, but the question says "the equation of motion of the sphere." The sphere's equation of motion depends on whether it's rotating about a fixed point or about an axis through its center. If rotating about an axis through its center, then torque isn't zero. But if it's rotating about a fixed point, torque is zero.

Wait, but in the question, the sphere is uniform. So, if it's rotating about a fixed point, then the torque is zero, so dω/dt is zero. So, ω is constant. So, the equation would be dω/dt =0 → ω is constant. So, the correct equation is ω=const. So, option A.

Alternatively, if the sphere is spinning about its own center, then the equation would be different. But the question doesn't state that. So, I think the correct answer is option A.

Wait, let me think again. The Euler equations are:

I₁ dω₁/dt + (I₂ - I₃)ω₂ × ω₃ = τ₁
And since I₁=I₂=I₃, the first two terms are zero. So, dω/dt = τ/(I₁). But τ is zero for a fixed point, so dω/dt=0. Hence, ω is constant.

The problem involves a uniform sphere with moments of inertia \( I_1 = I_2 = I_3 \), which implies it is a solid sphere. The goal is to determine the equation of motion using Euler's equations. For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia about any axis through the center is \( I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2 \), and all three moments of inertia are equal. Euler's equations for rotation are:

\[
I_1 \frac{d\omega_1}{dt} + (I_2 - I_3) \omega_2 \times \omega_3 = \tau_1,
\]
\[
I_2 \frac{d\omega_2}{dt} + (I_3 - I_1) \omega_3 \times \omega_1 = \tau_2,
\]
\[
I_3 \frac{d\omega_3}{dt} + (I_1 - I_2) \omega_2 \times \omega_1 = \tau_3.
\]

Since \( I_1 = I_2 = I_3 \), the cross terms vanish (\( I_2 - I_3 = 0 \), etc.), leaving:

\[
\tau_1 = I_1 \frac{d\omega_1}{dt}, \quad \tau_2 = I_2 \frac{d\omega_2}{dt}, \quad \tau_3 = I_3 \frac{d\omega_3}{dt}.
\]

This implies \( \frac{d\omega}{dt} = \frac{\tau}{I} \), where \( \tau \) is the torque. For a solid sphere, the angular momentum \( L = I \omega \), so \( \tau = \frac{dL}{dt} = I \frac{d\omega}{dt} \). Substituting this into Euler's equations gives:

\[
0 = I \frac{d\omega}{dt} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d\omega}{dt} = 0.
\]

This means the angular velocity \( \omega \) is constant. Therefore, the equation of motion is \( \omega = \text{const} \).

Analyzing the options:

- **A: \( \omega = \text{const} \)** is correct because \( \omega \) remains constant if there is no net torque (\( \tau = 0 \)).
- **B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I** are incorrect because none of them describe the scenario where \( \omega \) is constant.
