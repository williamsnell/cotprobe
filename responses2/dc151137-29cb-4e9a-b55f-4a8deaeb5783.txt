Question:

Which of the following statements would "supply-side" economists disagree with?

Options:

A: Tax changes cause shifts in aggregate supply that work against shifts in aggregate demand thus reducing the effect of the tax change on real GDP.
B: A tax increase is likely to decrease aggregate supply by decreasing after-tax wages and thus providing disincentives to work.
C: A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by boosting saving investment and thus capital accumulation.
D: A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by providing greater rewards for risk taking.
E: A tax cut is likely to decrease aggregate supply by creating a budget deficit.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here. Hmm, the question is about supply-side economists and which statement they would disagree with. I'm a bit rusty on my macroeconomics, but let me think through this.

So the question gives options A to E. I need to figure out which statement supply-side economists would disagree with. Supply-side thinking usually emphasizes things like taxes, regulations, and public spending as tools to stabilize the economy and stimulate growth. They tend to push for policies that inject more money into the economy to create jobs and boost aggregate demand.

The options are about different tax changes and their effects. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Tax changes cause shifts in aggregate supply that work against shifts in aggregate demand, thus reducing the effect of the tax change on real GDP. Wait, supply-side economists would think that tax changes affect aggregate supply. For example, a tax cut would reduce the amount people take away, which might reduce their willingness to work, but I'm not sure. Or does it affect saving? If taxes are cut, people have more money to save, which would increase investment and thus aggregate supply. So a tax cut would increase aggregate supply. So if that's the case, the statement in A says it would shift supply against demand. If supply shifts in the direction opposite to demand, then the effect is neutral or negative. So if A is correct, supply-side economists would agree that a tax change works against AD, so they would disagree with such a statement. Wait, but the statement says that the tax change reduces the effect on real GDP. Hmm, maybe I need to think more about the direction.

Option B: A tax increase is likely to decrease aggregate supply by decreasing after-tax wages and thus providing disincentives to work. Wait, if taxes increase, people have less money. So their after-tax wages might drop. Lower after-tax wages could reduce the incentive to work. So yes, a tax increase would lower aggregate supply because workers have less money to spend. So supply-side economists would not agree with this because they believe that lower wages make it harder for people to work, so they would decrease supply. So if option B is saying that a tax increase decreases AD by working less, supply-side people would disagree with B. So the statement would be incorrect for them.

Option C: A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by boosting saving and investment. Oh yeah, tax cuts mean more disposable income. So people have more money to save and spend. This increases saving and investment, which would increase aggregate supply. So supply-side economists would agree that a tax cut increases aggregate supply. So a statement saying that a tax cut increases supply would be in line with supply-side thinking and would not be a disagreement. So C is not the answer.

Option D: A tax cut increases supply by giving greater rewards for risk-taking. Wait, supply-side policies often encourage risk-taking because people are more optimistic and have more incentives. But I'm not sure if that's a point of contention. Some supply-side economists might argue that increased risk-taking could lead to more job creation, but I think the main issue is more about the money supply. So maybe D isn't the wrong statement for supply-side thinkers.

Option E: A tax cut decreases aggregate supply because it creates a budget deficit. Wait, a budget deficit occurs when government spending exceeds tax revenues. If taxes are cut, the government can reduce its budget deficit. The government can use the freed up money to spend on public projects, which would increase aggregate demand. So a tax cut would reduce the budget deficit and inject into the economy, increasing aggregate supply. So E is not correct for supply-side thinking, which would say that a tax cut increases AD.

So putting it together:

- A: If supply-side thinks tax changes affect AD, they might think that a tax change could either increase or decrease AD, depending on the situation. But the statement in A says that a tax change would shift supply in the opposite direction of AD, thus reducing the effect. If supply-side thinks that a tax cut increases AD, then A is correct and a supply-side person would disagree. But wait, option A says that a tax change causes shifts that work against AD. That would mean the effect is negative. If the person believes that tax changes affect AD, then A would be correct, which they would disagree with. So I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me clarify. Supply-side economists would likely believe that tax cuts increase aggregate supply because they support the idea of government spending. So if a tax cut increases AD, a supply-side person would say that, and any statement that says the effect is neutral or opposite would be wrong.

Option A says that a tax change causes shifts in supply that work against AD, thus reducing the effect. So if supply-side thinks that a tax change (like a tax cut) would cause AD to decrease due to reduced incentives for work, then A would be correct. But supply-side people would disagree with A because they think that the tax cut actually increases AD. So if option A is correct, which it is, then supply-side economists would disagree with it. Wait, but the question is which statement supply-side economists disagree with. So the correct answer would be the statement that is incorrect for supply-side thinkers.

Wait, let me rephrase. The question is, which of the following statements would supply-side economists disagree with. So the correct answer is the statement that's incorrect for supply-side.

So which options are correct according to supply-side?

Option C: A tax cut increases supply. That's correct. So supply-side would agree with C, not disagree. So C is correct, so not the wrong statement for them.

Option A: A tax change (e.g., cut) causes shifts in AD that work against AD, thus reducing effect. If supply-side thinks that a tax cut increases AD, then A would be correct, and supply-side would disagree with it. So the statement A is correct for supply-side, so the question is which statement they disagree with.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's think about each option's correctness.

Option A: If a tax change (e.g., a cut) causes shifts in AGS that work against AD, then the effect of the tax change on real GDP is negative. If supply-side thinks that a tax cut increases AD, then this statement (A) would be correct. So supply-side people would not agree with option A. So if the question is which would supply-side economists disagree with, the correct answer is the one that is incorrect for them.

So, for each option:

A: Correct from supply-side's perspective. So they would agree that a tax change causes shifts working against AD, thus reducing effect. So they would not disagree with A.

B: Correct according to supply-side's viewpoint. They think that a tax increase would lower AD because after-tax wages go down, making work less attractive. So B is correct, so supply-side people would not disagree with B.

C: Correct. Tax cuts increase AD. So they agree, so supply-side people would not disagree with C.

D: Correct. They believe that risk-taking is encouraged, but the statement doesn't present a problem with their argument. So supply-side would not disagree with D.

E: Incorrect. A tax cut would increase AD, so it's not creating a budget deficit. So E is incorrect for supply-side, so supply-side people would disagree with E.

So the correct answer must be E. Because E says a tax cut decreases aggregate supply, which is wrong.

Wait, but let me re-express this. The question is, which statement supply-side economists disagree with. So the correct answer is the one that's incorrect.

So the statements:

A: Correct. So supply-side people think it's correct.

B: Correct. They think it's correct.

C: Correct.

D: Correct.

E: Incorrect. So supply-side people disagree with E, because they think a tax cut increases AD, not decreases it. So the correct answer is E.

The question asks which statement supply-side economists would disagree with. Supply-side economists typically believe that tax changes can have positive effects on the economy, such as increasing aggregate supply by encouraging saving and investment, and increasing government spending. They often argue that tax cuts can reduce the budget deficit by increasing disposable income, which can lead to higher aggregate demand.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **Option A**: A tax change causing shifts in aggregate supply that work against shifts in aggregate demand is correct from a supply-side perspective. If a tax cut increases aggregate supply, this statement aligns with supply-side views and would not be a disagreement.
  
- **Option B**: A tax increase decreasing aggregate supply by reducing after-tax wages is also correct. A tax increase reduces disposable income, leading to lower after-tax wages and fewer incentives to work, which aligns with supply-side arguments.

- **Option C**: A tax cut increases aggregate supply by boosting saving and investment is correct. This aligns with supply-side policies and the belief that tax cuts can stimulate economic activity.

- **Option D**: A tax cut increases aggregate supply by providing greater rewards for risk-taking is also correct. This reflects supply-side optimism about risk-taking, though the statement does not present a direct disagreement.

- **Option E**: A tax cut decreases aggregate supply by creating a budget deficit is incorrect. A tax cut reduces the budget deficit, which would lead to increased government spending and higher aggregate demand. Therefore, supply-side economists would disagree with this statement, as they believe tax cuts promote economic growth.

### Conclusion:
The statement that supply-side economists would disagree with is **Option E**, as it incorrectly describes the effect of a tax cut on aggregate supply.

**Answer: E**
