Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about reducing prejudice, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The question is asking what methods are generally helpful in reducing prejudice. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different approach. 

Hmm, I remember that reducing prejudice involves addressing and challenging negative beliefs, not promoting or reinforcing positive ones. So I should probably eliminate options that promote positive behaviors or exacerbate existing biases.

Looking at the options:

A: Implementing a quota system. Quota systems are about limiting diversity, like ensuring certain groups have a certain number of representatives. That might help reduce discrimination in some contexts but doesn't directly address prejudice itself. It's more about managing groups rather than tackling root causes.

B: Use of subliminal messaging. Subliminal messages influence behavior without being conscious. This can affect beliefs, but it's not a method for reducing prejudice. It's more about manipulating perceptions through subtle signals.

C: Providing information contrary to beliefs, equal-status contact, and interdependence. This sounds promising. If the methods provide accurate information and promote equality, it can help individuals realize their true beliefs and reduce prejudice. For example, if someone's belief is wrong, they might correct it, which reduces prejudice. Also, equal status contact can prevent discrimination.

D: Promoting segregation to reduce intergroup conflict. Promoting segregation would likely increase conflict, not help. It's the opposite of what's needed.

E: Encouraging individuals to avoid discussing or acknowledging differences. That might reduce the level of discussion, but does it directly address prejudice? I'm not sure. It could prevent people from sharing differing views, but it doesn't solve the root issues.

F: Direct confrontation of prejudiced beliefs. Confrontation can sometimes lead to conflict, so it's not helpful for reducing prejudice but more about causing more tension.

G: Strict enforcement of penalties for prejudiced behavior. This would make people avoid those behaviors, but it might also reduce opportunities for positive interactions, which could reduce prejudice indirectly by limiting harmful actions.

H: Public information campaigns. These can educate and inform people about issues, which might reduce misunderstandings. But again, it's more of a proactive step to address beliefs rather than directly reducing prejudice.

I: Mandatory diversity training. This would increase diversity in society, but it's about managing groups rather than addressing root causes.

J: Forcing desegregation and busing. This is a serious policy that aims to promote equality, but it's about preventing discrimination, which can reduce prejudice.

So, the options that directly address reducing prejudice are C and H. Option C talks about providing accurate information, promoting equality, and interdependence. Option H is about enforcing penalties for prejudiced behavior, which might help by correcting beliefs. Option G is enforcing penalties, which could also help. 

Wait, I need to think more carefully. Option C is about giving information that corrects beliefs. If someone's belief is wrong, they might change their mind, which reduces prejudice. It's a proactive approach. Option H is about taking action against those who hold prejudiced beliefs, which could also help. 

Option G is about enforcing penalties, but if people are already prejudice, enforcing penalties might not help. It could even make things worse. So G might not be the best option.

So between C and H, both seem plausible. But let me think again. What are the main approaches to reducing prejudice? I remember that effective methods involve challenging negative beliefs, providing accurate information, and promoting equality. Those are key steps. So options that include these would be better.

Option C: providing information that contradicts beliefs, equal status contact, and interdependence. Equal status contact would mean that people feel they're treated the same as others, reducing discrimination. Also, providing accurate info would help individuals realize their true beliefs.

Option H: enforcing penalties. Wait, if someone is already prejudice, enforcing penalties might make them do worse, which is counterproductive. So H might not be the best choice. Unless it's a way to address the cause rather than the effect. For example, if someone's beliefs are incorrect, and you take action against them, maybe they change their beliefs. But that's a bit indirect.

So the best options are C and H. But looking at the options, C is more about providing information to correct beliefs, while H is about taking action against those holding prejudiced beliefs.

Wait, but the question is asking for methods that are generally helpful. So, I think providing accurate information (C) and enforcing penalties might both help, but I'm not sure which is more commonly cited.

Another thought: In some contexts, enforcing penalties may not be the best approach. It might lead to more negative behavior, which could exacerbate existing prejudice. So perhaps providing accurate information is a better approach.

So, the correct answer is likely C. But wait, looking at the options again, option H: enforcing penalties. That could be a way to correct prejudice if people are already practicing it. But I'm not so sure about that.

Alternatively, option G: enforcing penalties. If you take action against those who hold prejudiced beliefs, they might learn and change their behavior. But that's more about correcting the behavior, which is different from reducing the prejudice itself.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of what each option does.

Option C: It's about addressing the root of prejudice by providing information that corrects beliefs, promoting equality, and creating a more inclusive environment. This seems like a solid approach.

Option H: It's about taking action against those who hold prejudiced beliefs, which could lead to more adherence to those beliefs but might not necessarily reduce prejudice. It's more of a social control approach rather than addressing the underlying issues.

So, the best options are C and H. But looking at the options, C is a method, H is another. Let me check the original question again. The question is about methods generally viewed as helpful.

So, if I have to choose between C and H, I think C is more about providing the necessary information and addressing the beliefs directly, whereas H is more of a policy enforcement approach.

Therefore, the answer is likely option C: providing information contrary to beliefs, equal-status contact, and interdependence.

The question asks which methods are generally helpful in reducing prejudice. After analyzing the options, the most effective approaches involve addressing root causes and promoting equality. 

Option C, which includes providing accurate information, promoting equality, and fostering interdependence, directly addresses the root of prejudice by correcting beliefs and creating an inclusive environment. While option H, enforcing penalties against those with prejudiced beliefs, is also a valid approach, it may be more of a social control method rather than a proactive solution. Therefore, the best answer is:

ANSWER: C
