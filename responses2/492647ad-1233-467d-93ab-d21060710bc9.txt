Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. It says, "What is the total charge in coulombs of 75.0 kg of electrons?" The options are A to J, all in the same format but with different exponents and signs. I remember that electrons have a negative charge, so the total charge should be negative.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. I know that charge is calculated by multiplying the number of particles by the charge per particle. So for electrons, each has a charge of -1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, right? So the formula should be Q = n * e, where e is the charge of one electron.

Wait, but wait, n is the number of electrons. Oh, but we are given the mass, not the number of electrons. So I need to find out how many electrons are in 75 kg. 

I remember that the mass of one electron is about 9.109 x 10^-31 kilograms. So, n = mass / (mass per electron). Let me compute that. So 75 kg divided by (9.109e-31 kg/electron).

Calculating that: 75 / 9.109e-31. Let me do the division. 75 divided by 9.109 is approximately 8.23, but I have to account for the exponent. So it's 8.23e30 electrons. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 75 / 9.109e-31. Let me compute that. 

Wait, 75 / 9.109e-31 is the same as 75 * (1/(9.109e-31)) ). 1/(9.109e-31) is approximately 1.097e30. So 75 * 1.097e30 = 75 * 1.097e30 = let me compute that. 75 * 1.097 is approximately 82.275, so 8.2275e31 electrons. Wait, wait, wait, no, because 75 times 1.097e30 is 75e0 * 1.097e30 = 75 * 1.097e30 = (75 * 1.097) * 1e30. So 75 * 1.097 is about 82.275, so 82.275e30 = 8.2275e31 electrons. Oh wait, no, wait, 75 * 1.097e30 equals 82.275e30, which is 8.2275e31.

Wait, no, wait, 75 is 7.5e1, 1.097e30 is 1.097 * 1e30. So 7.5 * 1.097 is 8.2275, and 1e1 * 1e30 is 1e31. So yes, n is 8.2275e31 electrons.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. 75 kg of electrons: So each electron has a mass of 9.109e-31 kg. So the number of electrons is (75 kg) / (9.109e-31 kg/electron) = 75/(9.109e-31) = approximately 75 * 1.097e30 ≈ 8.2275e31 electrons. Yeah, that's correct.

So now, each electron has a charge of -1.602e-19 C. So total charge Q = n * e = 8.2275e31 * (-1.602e-19 C).

Let me compute that. Multiply 8.2275e31 by 1.602e-19.

8.2275 * 1.602 is approximately... Let me compute that. 8 * 1.6 is 12.8, 0.2275 *1.6 is about 0.364, and 8.2275 * 0.002 is about 0.016455. So adding up roughly 12.8 + 0.364 = 13.164 + 0.016455 ≈ 13.180. So 13.18, and the exponents are e(31-19) = e12. So 13.18e12, so 1.318e13 coulombs. But wait, wait, no, because I have a negative sign. So Q = -1.318e13 C.

Looking at the options, option B is -1.32e13, option A is -2e13, etc. So the closest answer would be B.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because the first step could be where I made a mistake.

Wait, wait: 75 kg of electrons. Each electron's mass is 9.109e-31 kg. So number of electrons is 75 / 9.109e-31 = let's compute that. 75 / 9.109e-31 = 75 / 9.109 * 1e31. Let me compute 75 / 9.109. 9.109 * 8 = 72.872, which is 8. So 75 / 9.109 ≈ 8.2275. So 8.2275e31 electrons.

Each electron has charge of -1.602e-19 C. So total charge is 8.2275e31 * (-1.602e-19) = ?

Multiply 8.2275 by 1.602: let's compute 8 * 1.602 = 12.816, 0.2275 * 1.602 ≈ 0.36435. Total ≈ 13.18035. Now, exponents: 1e31 * 1e-19 = 1e12. So 13.18035e12 = 1.318035e13 C. But with the negative sign, so -1.318e13 C.

Looking at the options:

Option B is -1.32e13, which is very close. The other options are, for example, A is -2e13, which is double. So why are other options lower? Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the number of electrons is incorrect. Let me double-check n = m / m_e.

m is 75 kg, m_e is 9.109e-31 kg. So 75 / (9.109e-31) = approx 8.2275e31 electrons. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should use a more precise value for the mass of an electron. Let's take m_e as 9.10938356e-31 kg. So 75 / 9.10938356e-31 = ?

Let me compute that precise division: 75 / 9.10938356e-31.

Compute 75 / 9.10938356e-31 = 75 / 9.10938356 * 1e31.

Compute 75 / 9.10938356: Let's see, 9.10938356 * 8 = 72.875, 75-72.875=2.125 left. 

So 8 + (2.125 / 9.10938356). 2.125 / 9.10938356 ≈ 0.2328. So approximately 8.2328. So 8.2328e31 electrons.

Wait, but wait, if 8.2328e31 multiplied by 1.602e-19 would give...

8.2328e31 * 1.602e-19 = (8.2328 * 1.602) * 1e(31-19) = (8.2328 * 1.602) * 1e12.

Calculate 8 * 1.602 = 12.816, 0.2328 *1.602= approx 0.373. So 12.816 + 0.373 = 13.189. So 13.189e12 C = 1.3189e13 C. So the total charge is -1.3189e13 C.

Looking at the options, B is -1.32e13, which is very close. But wait, why is another option, like option E, -1.44e13? Hmm. Maybe because I made an error in the exponent somewhere.

Wait, wait a second another approach: maybe I should compute the number of electrons as (75 kg) * (1 mol / 9.109e-31 kg) = 75 / 9.109e-31 mol. Then, each mole of electrons has 6.022e23 electrons. So total electrons = (75 / 9.109e-31) * 6.022e23.

Let me compute that: 75 / 9.109e-31 = 8.234e31 mol. Then multiplied by 6.022e23 electrons/mol: 8.234e31 * 6.022e23 = ?

Multiply the numbers: 8.234 * 6.022 ≈ let me compute 8 *6=48, 0.234*6=1.404, 8*0.022=0.176, 0.234 *0.022≈0.005148. So 48 + 1.404 = 49.404, plus 0.176 = 49.58, plus 0.005148≈49.585. So 49.585e(31+23) = 49.585e54. Wait, wait, no, wait: 1e31 * 1e23 = 1e54.

Wait, wait no: 8.234e31 * 6.022e23 = (8.234 *6.022) * 1e(31+23) = 8.234*6.022e54.

Wait, 8.234 *6.022 is approximately 8 *6 =48, 8 * 0.022≈0.176, 0.234 *6≈1.404, 0.234 *0.022≈0.005148. So 48 +0.176=48.176, 1.404→49.58, plus 0.005148 →49.585. So about 49.585e54 → 4.9585e55? Wait, no, wait, wait a minute, that can't be right.

Wait, 8.234e31 is 8.234 * 1e31, and 6.022e23 is 6.022 * 1e23. Multiply them together: (8.234 *6.022) * 1e(31+23) = (approx 49.585) * 1e54 = 4.9585e55. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, 75 kg is way bigger than a mole. Oh wait, perhaps I made an error in the unit conversion. Let me check another way.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula correctly. So number of electrons n = (mass in kg) / (mass per electron).

Yes, so 75 kg / 9.109e-31 kg/electron = 75 / 9.109e-31 ≈ 8.23e31.

Then, each electron has a charge of -1.602e-19 C. So Q = n * e.

So 8.23e31 * (-1.602e-19) = ?

Compute 8.23 *1.602 = let's calculate:

8 *1.602 = 12.816.

0.23 *1.602 = approx 0.36846.

So total is 12.816 + 0.36846 = 13.18446.

So 13.18446e(31-19) = 13.18446e12 = 1.318446e13 C. So Q ≈ -1.318e13 C.

So the closest option is B: -1.32e13 C.

Wait, but why is option E (-1.44e13) present? Let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the correct number of significant figures.

Wait, the given mass is 75.0 kg. That's three significant figures. So the options should probably be precise to that. Let me recalculate with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps the actual calculation using exact numbers would give a slightly different result. Let me use precise values for m_e. The exact mass of an electron is 9.10938356e-31 kg.

So n =75 /9.10938356e-31.

Compute 75 divided by 9.10938356e-31.

Let me compute 75 / 9.10938356 = approximately 8.2275e30.

Wait, wait, no, wait: 9.10938356e-31 is 0.000...e-31, but 75 is 7.5e1. So 7.5e1 / 9.10938356e-31 = (7.5 /9.10938356) ) * 1e(1+31) = (approx 0.82275) *1e32 = 8.2275e31 electrons. So same as before.

So n is 8.2275e31.

n * e = 8.2275e31 * (-1.60217663e-19) = ?

Multiply 8.2275e31 * 1.60217663e-19.

Compute 8.2275 * 1.60217663 = let me calculate that more precisely.

8 *1.60217663 = 12.8174.

0.2275 *1.60217663 ≈ let's compute:

0.2 *1.60217663 = 0.320435.

0.0275 *1.60217663 ≈ 0.04406.

Adding these: 0.320435 + 0.04406 ≈ 0.364495.

So total 12.8174 +0.364495≈13.181895.

So 13.181895e(31-19) = 13.181895e12 = 1.3181895e13 C. So about -1.318e13 C.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is -1.32e13 C. So that's the closest, correct answer.

To determine the total charge of 75.0 kg of electrons, we start by using the relationship between the number of particles and the charge per particle. Each electron has a charge of \( -1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). The number of electrons \( n \) is calculated by dividing the mass of the electrons by their individual mass:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{mass per electron}} = \frac{75.0 \, \mathrm{kg}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg/electron}} = 8.2275 \times 10^{31} \, \mathrm{electrons}.
\]

Next, we calculate the total charge by multiplying the number of electrons by the charge of one electron:

\[
Q = n \times e = (8.2275 \times 10^{31}) \times (-1.602 \times 10^{-19}) = -1.318 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

The closest option to this value is **B: -1.32 × 10¹³ C**. The other options (A, C, D, E) are either too high or too low, likely due to rounding or using an outdated value for the electron mass. Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: B
