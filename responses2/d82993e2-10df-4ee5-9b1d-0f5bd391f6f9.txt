Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Frere's discovery. Let's see, I remember that Frere was a paleontologist, right? He studied the remains of dinosaurs. So, maybe his discovery was related to finding something from an ancient civilization.

The question is asking about where his discovery was found. The options are A to J, each describing a different location. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Inside a previously undiscovered pyramid. Hmm, I'm not sure if Frere was specifically looking inside pyramids. I think he might have found some bones, but I don't recall him pinpointing a specific pyramid. Maybe he found some bones in a place, but I don't think it's a pyramid.

Option B: In the depths of the ocean, near a sunken ship. That sounds more like a modern discovery, maybe from a different era. I think Frere's work was more focused on ancient finds. So this might not be correct.

Option C: On a remote island, far from known human settlements. That doesn't fit well. I remember reading that Frere worked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was in Europe, which would have places like isolated islands or forests. So this might be more of a modern setting, which doesn't match his era.

Option D: On the surface, above remains of extinct animals. Wait, Frere's work was about dinosaurs, not other animals. So this option is probably incorrect because he studied dinosaurs, not other extinct species.

Option E: Bute under remains of extinct animals. No, that's similar to D, but still not about dinosaurs. His focus was on the dinosaurs.

Option F: In a region of Africa where no one thought humans had ever lived. That sounds like a modern context. Frere was working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I think he found bones from Africa, but I'm not sure if he was looking there specifically. Wait, maybe he did, but I'm not certain.

Option G: On top of the ruins of a medieval castle. That sounds more like a modern or post-reading period. I don't think Frere was looking there.

Option H: In the heart of a bustling modern city, under a skyscraper. That's even more modern, so probably not it.

Option I: Within remnants of a prehistoric cave. That's a possibility. I remember reading that Frere's collection included bones and shell fragments from the Krater Cave, which is in the Middle East. So this might be correct.

Option J: In a region of Africa where only dinosaur fossils had been found. That sounds like a modern take, not sure about Frere's work.

So, putting it together, Frere's discovery was likely in a cave, which would be option I. The others don't fit his era or the specific details he worked on.

The correct answer is I: within the remnants of a prehistoric cave dwelling.

Answer: I
