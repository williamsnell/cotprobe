Okay, so I've got this exchange rate problem. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about figuring out where a Big Mac is the most expensive. I think I need to compare the cost of the Big Mac in each country based on their exchange rates.

The exchange rates given are:
- 0.5 British Pounds per dollar,
- 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar,
- 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar.

And the costs in each country's currency:
- 3 dollars in America.
- 2 pounds in England.
- 50 pesos in Mexico.
- 200 yuan in China.

Wait, so each country's Big Mac costs a certain number of their own currency. But I need to find the total cost in dollars for each, right? Because the question is asking which one is the most expensive, so I have to convert each Big Mac price from their local currency to dollars.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list the given data:

1. **Exchange Rates:**
   - BP (British Pound) per dollar = 0.5. So, 1 British Pound = 0.5 dollars. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, exchange rate is usually the amount of foreign currency per one unit of home currency. So, 0.5 British Pounds per dollar means that 1 British Pound is worth 0.5 dollars. Wait, no, that can't be right because 1 pound would be 0.5 dollars, so in exchange terms, a dollar is stronger. Wait, but for exchange rates, which way do they go? Let me think.

Wait, exchange rate is usually expressed as foreign currency per 1 unit of home currency. So, 1 British Pound per dollar would mean that 1 British Pound = 1 / 0.5 = 2 dollars. Wait, no. Wait, no, let me clarify.

Wait, the exchange rate is how much of the foreign currency you get per one of the home currency. So, if 0.5 British Pounds per dollar, that means 1 British Pound equals 2 dollars. Because 0.5 British Pounds = 1 dollar, so 1 dollar = 0.5 BP. So, to get dollars per BP, I take 1 BP / 0.5 = 2 dollars per BP. So, 1 BP = 2 dollars. So, the exchange rate from BP to USD is 2. So, which way the money is stronger? Well, if 1 BP = 2 USD, then the British Pound is stronger (because it's worth more in USD). So, the pound is more expensive than the dollar in the sense that it takes more dollars to buy a pound.

But wait, the exchange rates given are: British Pounds per dollar. So 0.5 BP per dollar. So, for every dollar, you get 0.5 BP. So, 1 dollar buys you 0.5 BP.

So, to find out how much a British Pound would cost in dollars, we can invert the exchange rate. So, if 1 USD buys 0.5 BP, then 1 BP would cost 1 / 0.5 = 2 USD. So, 1 BP = 2 USD.

Similarly, for the Mexican Peso:

10 Mexican Pesos per dollar. So, 10 USD per Mexican Peso. So, 1 USD = 10 MP. So, 1 MP = 1/10 USD = $0.10.

And the Chinese Yuan: 100 Yuan per dollar. So, 1 USD = 100 Y. So, 1 Y = 0.01 USD.

Now, the Big Mac prices in each country's currency:

- America: $3
- England: 2 pounds
- Mexico: 50 Pesos
- China: 200 Yuan.

Wait, but the question is, which country has the most expensive Big Mac. So, I need to find the cost in USD for each, then compare.

Let me compute each:

1. **USA**: The price is $3. So, already in USD, so it's $3.

2. **England**: The price is 2 pounds. So, how much is that in USD? Since 1 pound = 2 USD (from earlier calculation), 2 pounds would be 2 * 2 = $4.

3. **Mexico**: 50 Pesos. Each MP is $0.10. So, 50 * 0.10 = $5.

Wait no, 50 Pesos * 0.10 USD/MP = 5 USD. So, $5.

4. **China**: 200 Yuan. Each Y is 0.01 USD. So, 200 * 0.01 = 2 USD.

So, the costs in USD are:

- USA: $3
- England: $4
- Mexico: $5
- China: $2

So, comparing these, the most expensive is Mexico at $5.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check each calculation to make sure I didn't mix up anything.

So for England: 2 pounds. If 1 pound = 2 USD, then 2 pounds = 2 * 2 = $4.

Mexico: 50 Pesos. 1 MP is 0.10 USD, so 50 * 0.10 = $5.

Yes, correct.

So, the costs are:

- USA: 3
- England: 4
- Mexico:5
- China:2.

So the most expensive is Mexico at $5. So the answer should be C: Mexico.

The exchange rates are given as follows:

- **British Pound (BP):** 0.5 BP per dollar → 1 BP = 2 dollars (since 1 BP / 0.5 BP/dollar = 2 dollars/dollar).
- **Mexican Peso (MP):** 10 MP per dollar → 1 MP = 0.10 dollars.
- **Chinese Yuan (CNY):** 100 CNY per dollar → 1 CNY = 0.01 dollars.

The Big Mac prices in each country's currency are:

- **USA:** $3
- **England:** 2 pounds → 2 pounds * 2 dollars per pound = $4
- **Mexico:** 50 Pesos → 50 Pesos * 0.10 dollars per peso = $5
- **China:** 200 Yuan → 200 Yuan * 0.01 dollars per yuan = $2

Comparing the costs in USD:

- USA: $3
- England: $4
- Mexico: $5
- China: $2

The most expensive Big Mac is in **Mexico** at $5.
