Okay, so I've got this problem about whales migrating, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question says that a scientist studied two types of whales: humpback and gray. The humpback whales traveled 2,240 miles over 28 days, and the gray whales did 2,368 miles in 32 days. Now, the question is, if the humpback whales had traveled at the same rate for 32 days, how many more miles would they have than the gray whales?

Hmm, so I think I need to find the rate for each whale and then calculate how much each would travel in 32 days, and then find the difference between those two totals.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, for the humpback whales: They went 2,240 miles in 28 days. So their daily rate would be 2,240 divided by 28. Let me calculate that. 2,240 รท 28. Hmm, 28 times 80 is 2,240. So their rate is 80 miles per day. That makes sense because 28 days times 80 is 2,240.

Now, the gray whales did 2,368 miles in 32 days. So their daily rate is 2,368 divided by 32. Let me do that division. 32 times 74 is 2,368 because 32 times 70 is 2,240, and 32 times 4 is 128, so 2,240 + 128 = 2,368. So the rate is 74 miles per day.

Wait a second, no, wait. Wait, 32 times 74 is actually 2,368? Let me double-check. 32 * 70 is 2,240, and 32 *4 is 128, so 2,240 +128=2,368. Yeah, that's right. So the gray whales' daily rate is 74 miles.

Now, if the humpback whales were to migrate for 32 days at 80 miles per day, how far would they go? That's 80 miles/day *32 days. Let me calculate that: 80 *32. 80 times 30 is 2,400, plus 80*2=160. So 2,400+160=2,560 miles.

The gray whales, on the other hand, were traveling at 74 miles per day. So in 32 days, that's 74 *32. Let me calculate that. 70*32 is 2,240, and 4*32 is 128. So 2,240 + 128=2,368 miles.

Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, 74 times 32. Let me do it another way. 74 *32 is 74*(30+2) = 74*30 +74*2. 74 *30 is 2,220, plus 74*2=148. So 2,220 +148 is 2,368 miles. Oh wait, that's the same as before. So gray whales at 74 mph for 32 days would have gone 2,368 miles.

Wait, but wait, the humpback had gone 2,560 miles, and gray is 2,368. So the difference is 2,560 minus 2,368, which is 192. So the humpback would have traveled 192 more miles.

Looking at the options, option C is 192. So the answer should be C.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check all steps.

Humpback rate: 2,240 /28 = 80. Correct. 28*80=2,240.

Gray rate: 2,368 /32. Let me calculate 32*74: 32*70=2,240, 32*4=128. 2,240+128=2,368. So yes, 74. Correct.

H in 32 days:80*32=2,560.

G in 32 days:74*32=2,368.

Difference: 2,560 -2,368=192. So yes, correct. So the answer is C:192.

The humpback whales would travel 192 more miles than the gray whales at the same rate for 32 days.

Answer: C: 192
