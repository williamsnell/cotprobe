Question:

One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the father did not retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege.
B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.
C: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.
D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.
E: admissible, because the lawsuit makes all previous communications related to the case public.
F: admissible, because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father was.
G: admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.
H: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.
I: inadmissible, because the consultation was preliminary and does not constitute a formal attorney-client relationship.
J: inadmissible, because the boy is a minor and cannot legally waive his rights to attorney-client privilege.

Okay, so I'm faced with this legal question here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

The scenario is about a pilot who ran out of gas and crashed into a neighboring state. An 9-year-old boy was walking to school and was struck by an object that fell from the plane. The father of the boy is suing the pilot's father, the boy's father, but the father didn't retain an attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, he hired another lawyer. At trial, the pilot's attorney called the consulting attorney to testify about the boy's physical condition during a meeting with the father and his son.

The question is whether this statement is admissible in court. The options are A to J, each with a different reason for admissibility or inadmissibility.

First, I need to recall the basics of attorney-client privilege. The principle states that an attorney has a private privilege to consult with clients regarding matters relating to the practice of their profession. This privilege can sometimes be waived, usually when the client is not in possession of a lawyer. But certain conditions can prevent this, like when the attorney is representing someone else or when the client isn't the attorney's direct client.

In this case, the boy is a minor, so he's not an adult. He's a minor walking to school, so he's a client. Now, the father didn't retain an attorney to represent the boy in the lawsuit. Instead, he hired another lawyer. So, the father is acting as a client, not an attorney, for the boy.

When the father called the consulting attorney, that's a possible breach of the privilege if the client is not the attorney's client. Wait, but the boy was the client here. So, does the father's calling the other attorney constitute a breach?

Wait, the boy is the one being represented, not the father. So the father is acting as the client, not the attorney. So, the father is acting as the client, so the privilege might be inapplicable. Because the privilege requires the client to have a lawyer, not the other way around.

Wait, but the question is whether the statement is admissible. So the father is acting as the client, so the attorney-client privilege doesn't apply unless the client is the person in the position of trust. The boy is the client here, so the father is the client, not the attorney. So the father is acting as the client, not the attorney. Therefore, the privilege wouldn't apply because the client (the father) is not the one acting as the attorney. So the attorney-client privilege doesn't protect him from this.

But wait, what about the situation where the boy is a minor? Does that affect anything? The boy is a minor, so he doesn't have the right to represent himself as an attorney. But here, the father is the one calling the consulting attorney. So the boy is the client, the father is the client. So the father is acting as the client, not the attorney. So the privilege doesn't apply because the client isn't the one acting as the attorney.

Wait, but maybe the other way around. Let's think about when the attorney is making a call to another person. Let's say an attorney is representing a client, but the client isn't the one acting as the attorney. Then, the privilege doesn't apply. So in this case, the father is the client, not the attorney. Therefore, the privilege shouldn't apply because the client isn't the one who's acting as the attorney. So the father didn't retain an attorney, so he's acting as the client.

So the statement is about the physical condition of the boy during an attorney-client consultation. But the boy is the client. So if the boy is the client, and the father is acting as the client, then the privilege doesn't apply.

Wait, but the father is the one calling the other attorney. So maybe the father is acting as the client, and the other attorney is acting as the attorney. So the client is the father, and the attorney is another person. But the boy is the one being represented by the father, not the other attorney. So the father is the client, and the other attorney is the one acting on behalf of the boy.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the father is acting as the client, and the other attorney is the one who is acting on his behalf. So the client is the father, the other person is the attorney.

In that case, the privilege doesn't apply because the client is the father, not the other person.

Alternatively, maybe the other attorney is the one whose privilege is inapplicable. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C says the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach. That would apply if the father is acting as an attorney, but he's the client. So the privilege doesn't apply.

Option G says the privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired. No, because the client (father) is acting as the client, not the attorney. The attorney's privilege is about the person who is acting as the attorney. So the father is not the one acting as the attorney, he's the client. So G is incorrect.

Option A is about the father not retaining the consulting attorney. The question says he didn't retain the consulting attorney but hired another. So he did retain another, but the father didn't retain the one who would normally be there. Wait, no, the father didn't retain an attorney. So perhaps the father is acting as the client, and the other attorney is acting on his behalf. So the father's call is to the other attorney, who is acting on his behalf. So the client is the father, and the other person is the attorney. The boy is the client, so the father's statement is about the client's condition. Since the client isn't the one who's acting as the attorney (the other), the privilege doesn't apply.

So the statement is about a client's condition, not the attorney's. So the father's statement is about the client's condition, not the attorney's. So the privilege doesn't apply.

So the correct reasoning is that the father didn't retain an attorney for the case, so he's acting as the client (the father) to the other attorney. The boy is the client, so the statement is about the client's condition. Since the client isn't the one acting as the attorney, the privilege doesn't apply. So the statement is inadmissible because the attorney-client privilege doesn't protect against a statement made by the client to an attorney who is acting on behalf of another client.

Wait, but the boy is the client, and the father is the client. So the father is acting as the client, and the other person is the attorney. So the client is the father, the other person is the attorney.

So in this case, the boy is not the client of the other person. The other person is acting on behalf of the boy. The statement is about the client (father) condition. So the privilege doesn't apply.

Looking back at the options, option C says the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach. That would be correct because the father is the client, not the attorney. So the statement is not admissible because the privilege doesn't apply.

Alternatively, option G says the privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired. But that's incorrect because the client is the father, not the one acting as the attorney. So G is wrong.

Wait, perhaps another angle: sometimes, if a client is not a licensed attorney, the privilege doesn't apply unless the client is acting as an attorney. In this case, the boy is the client, and the father is the client. So he's acting as the client, not as the attorney. Therefore, the privilege doesn't apply.

So the statement isn't admissible because the privilege doesn't protect against it. So the correct answer is C: inadmissible because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option C says the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach. That's correct because the client (father) isn't the one acting as the attorney. So the privilege doesn't apply.

Another thought: sometimes if the client is a minor, the privilege doesn't apply. But since the client is the father, not the other person, the minor doesn't apply here. So the child's rights are irrelevant.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the father's statement is admissible under the attorney-client privilege. The boy is the client, and the father is acting as the client to a different attorney. The attorney-client privilege protects clients from privileged communications with their clients, not their own attorneys. Since the father is the client, acting on behalf of the boy, the privilege does not apply. 

Option C correctly states that the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach, as the father is the client, not the attorney. Therefore, the statement is inadmissible.

ANSWER: C
