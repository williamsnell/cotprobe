Question:

On December 30, a restaurant entered into a written contract with a bakery to supply the restaurant with all of its bread needs for the next calendar year. The contract contained a provision wherein the restaurant promised to purchase "a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 per loaf. " On a separate sheet, there was a note stating that any modifications must be in writing. The parties signed each sheet. Both sides performed fully under the contract for the first four months. On May 1, the president of the bakery telephoned the manager of the restaurant and told him that, because of an increase in the cost of wheat, the bakery would be forced to raise its prices to $1. 20 per loaf. The manager said he understood and agreed to the price increase. The bakery then shipped 100 loaves (the amount ordered by the restaurant) to the restaurant, along with a bill for $120. The restaurant sent the bakery a check for$100 and refused to pay any more. Is the restaurant obligated to pay the additional $20?

Options:

A: Yes, because the May 1 modification was enforceable even though it was not supported by new consideration.
B: No, because the bakery failed to provide written notice of the price increase as stipulated in the original contract.
C: No, because the price increase was due to external factors and not a decision by the bakery.
D: Yes, because the bakery detrimentally relied on the modification by making the May shipment to the restaurant.
E: No, because the original contract did not specify a price adjustment clause.
F: No, because the modifying contract was not in writing; it was, therefore, unenforceable under the UCC.
G: Yes, because the restaurant was aware of the price increase before the delivery was made.
H: No, because there was no consideration to support the modification.
I: Yes, because the restaurant manager verbally agreed to the price increase.
J: Yes, because the price increase is minimal and doesn't significantly affect the restaurant's expenses.

Okay, so I have this contract question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that a restaurant and a bakery entered into a written contract on December 30, promising to supply all their bread needs for the next calendar year. The contract has a clause saying they must purchase a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 each. On May 1, the bakery's president called the manager and said the cost of wheat has increased, so they'll raise prices to $1.20 per loaf. The manager agreed and the bakery shipped 100 loaves along with a bill for $120. The restaurant paid $100 and didn't pay again.

The question is whether the restaurant is obligated to pay the additional $20.

Alright, so I remember that contract law has rules about modifications. The key points are whether the modification is enforceable and whether it's supported by new consideration.

The original contract had to have a clause about modifications. The contract wasn't specified, but I think modifications are allowed if they're in writing. Wait, but the contract wasn't in writing, right? The original contract was written, but then there's a note that modifications must be in writing. So maybe the contract as written doesn't enforce modifications, so any modification must be in writing.

Wait, but the contract itself didn't specify a price change, so maybe the modification is unenforceable because the contract didn't say the modification is required. Or wait, maybe the contract does not specify that, so the modification is void unless it's in writing.

Wait, but the contract does have a clause about purchasing 100 loaves at $1 each. So if the price increases, the contract might not have a clause for that, so the modification is not required.

Alternatively, the contract was written, but if it doesn't specify the modification, the contract might not be enforceable to require modifications. So any modification must be in writing, but the contract itself doesn't say anything about it.

Wait, but the issue is whether the modification is enforceable. So the problem is that the modification wasn't supported by new consideration.

Wait, in contracts, a modification is supported if there's new consideration. But what's new consideration?

In the original contract, the restaurant is buying 100 loaves at $1 each, so that's an upfront cost. If the price increases, maybe the restaurant can argue that they're paying more, thus getting the modification. But the bakery is the one paying more, so maybe the restaurant can't argue that.

Wait, but the contract didn't have any consideration for the modification. The contract just says they have to buy 100 at $1 each. So the modification is not supported by any consideration because the contract doesn't specify. So the modification is not enforceable.

Wait, but the note says modifications must be in writing. So the modification was in writing, but the contract didn't specify it, so the modification is not enforceable.

So the restaurant didn't have to pay anything extra because the contract didn't require it. Therefore, they weren't obligated to pay the additional $20.

So looking at the options:

Option B says the bakery failed to provide written notice, so the modification wasn't supported. That's correct. Because the original contract didn't specify, so the modification wasn't supported by new consideration.

Option A says the modification was enforceable because it wasn't supported. But that's wrong because the contract didn't require it. So A is incorrect.

Option F says the modifying contract wasn't in writing, so it's unenforceable. But the note says modifications must be in writing, so it was. So F is incorrect.

Option G says the restaurant was aware before delivery. But the contract didn't specify that, so that's irrelevant.

Option E says the contract didn't specify a price adjustment clause. That's correct, so E is right.

So the correct answer should be either B or E.

Wait, the options are:

A: Yes, because the modification was enforceable even though it wasn't supported by new consideration.

B: No, because the bakery failed to provide written notice.

E: No, because the original contract didn't specify a price adjustment clause.

Wait, the original contract didn't specify a price adjustment clause, so the modification wasn't supported. So the answer is E.

But wait, the question is about whether the restaurant was obligated to pay the additional $20. Since the contract didn't require it, the restaurant wasn't obligated. So the answer is E.

But wait, another angle: the modification was in writing, but the contract didn't require it. So the contract's original provision didn't require the modification, so the modification was not supported.

So yes, the answer should be E.

The restaurant entered into a written contract with the bakery, promising to supply all their bread needs for the next calendar year at a minimum of 100 loaves per month at $1 each. However, the contract did not specify a price adjustment clause, and the modification (price increase to $1.20 per loaf) was in writing, as stipulated in the contract's note. 

In contract law, modifications are enforceable only if they are in writing and supported by new consideration. The original contract did not require the modification, and there was no indication that the contract included a price adjustment clause. Therefore, the modification was not supported by new consideration, and the contract did not require the restaurant to pay the additional $20. 

The bakery fulfilled the modification by shipping the loaves and providing the bill, but the contract did not require this change, making the modification unenforceable.
