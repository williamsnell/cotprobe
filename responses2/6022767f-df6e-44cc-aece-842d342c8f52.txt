Okay, so I need to solve this problem where two lines are perpendicular, and I have to find the value of 'a'. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. That's a key point. So, I need to find the slopes of both lines and then set their product equal to -1 to solve for 'a'.

The equations given are:
1. x + 2y + 3 = 0
2. ax + 2y + 3 = 0

I think the slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope. So, I should convert both equations into that form.

Starting with the first equation: x + 2y + 3 = 0. Let's solve for y.
Subtract x and 3 from both sides: 2y = -x -3.
Then divide both sides by 2: y = (-1/2)x - 3/2.
So, the slope (m1) of the first line is -1/2.

Now, the second equation: ax + 2y +3 =0. Let's solve for y.
Subtract ax and 3: 2y = -ax -3.
Divide both sides by 2: y = (-a/2)x - 3/2.
So, the slope (m2) of the second line is -a/2.

Since the lines are perpendicular, m1 * m2 should equal -1. Let me write that down:

m1 * m2 = (-1/2) * (-a/2) = -1

Wait, hold on. Let me calculate that correctly. Multiplying the two slopes: (-1/2) * (-a/2) equals (a/4). Because negative times negative is positive, and 1* a is a, and denominator 2*2 is 4.

So, a/4 = -1? Because m1*m2 = -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the product is -1, then a/4 = -1, which would give a = -4. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, no, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because m1 is -1/2, m2 is -a/2. So, their product is (-1/2)*(-a/2) = (a)/4. So, that product should be equal to -1 because the lines are perpendicular.

Wait, that would mean a/4 = -1, so a = -4. Hmm, that's one of the options. So, option C is -4. Is that correct?

Wait, but let me think again. If two lines are perpendicular, their slopes should multiply to -1. So, m1 * m2 = -1.

So, (-1/2) * (-a/2) = (-1/2) * (-a/2) = (a)/4. So, setting that equal to -1:

a/4 = -1 → a = -4.

Hmm, that's option C. But wait, maybe I messed up the sign somewhere. Let me check the equations again.

The first equation: x + 2y +3 = 0. Solving for y: 2y = -x -3 → y = (-1/2)x - 3/2. So slope is -1/2.

Second equation: ax + 2y +3 =0 → 2y = -ax -3 → y = (-a/2)x - 3/2. So slope is -a/2.

Multiply the slopes: (-1/2) * (-a/2) = (a)/4.

Set this equal to -1: (a)/4 = -1 → a = -4.

So, the answer should be -4, which is option C. So, I think that's the correct choice.

The product of the slopes must be -1. The slopes of the lines are (-1/2) and (-a/2). Their product is (a/4). Setting this equal to -1 gives a = -4.

Answer: C: -4
