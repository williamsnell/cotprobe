Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about hemophilia. Let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that hemophilia is a sex-linked blood disorder, and it's caused by a recessive gene. Right, so the gene is located on one of the X chromosomes.

The question says that an aphenotypically normal couple had a son with hemophilia. Wait, first off, what's an aphenotypically normal person? Oh, a phenotypically normal person means their chromosomes are normal, so they have two normal Xs. Because if they had hemophilia, they'd have a disorder, which is recessive.

So the parents are a normal man and a normal woman. But the son has hemophilia. Let's think about the parents' genotypes. Since the son has hemophilia, he must have gotten the affected X from his mother. But wait, the mother is normal, so she can't have hemophilia. Oh, right! So the mother must be a carrier. Because the father would have given her an X chromosome.

Wait, wait. The father's genotype: he's normal, so he has two normal Xs. The mother's genotype must be X^H Y, because she's a normal woman. Because if she had hemophilia, she would have to be X^h Y. But since she's normal, she's XX but with X^H and Y. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no: no, wait, hemophilia is X-linked recessive. So the male's X must carry the h allele. So the mother has X^H Y. The father has XY.

So the son gets an X from each parent. So the son has one X from the father (normal, X^Y) and one X from the mother (X^H). So he has X^H and Y. Since hemophilia is recessive, both alleles need to be h for the disorder. So the son has X^H Y, which means he has hemophilia.

So the question is, if the parents have another child, and it's a girl, what's the probability she has hemophilia? Since hemophilia is X-linked recessive, girls get their X from their mother. So the mother is X^H Y. So the daughter can only get X from her mother, right? So the daughter's X will come from the mother. Since the mother has X^H and Y, the daughter has a 50% chance of getting the X^H and 50% chance of getting Y.

So if the daughter gets the X^H, she'll have hemophilia (since X^h Y). If she gets Y, she'll be normal.

So the probability is 50%. So the answer should be option C: 50% chance.

The question involves a couple with hemophilia, a recessive X-linked disorder. The parents are a normal man and a normal woman. The son has hemophilia, indicating the mother is a carrier (X^H Y). For the next child, if a girl, the probability of having hemophilia is 50% because girls inherit their X chromosome from their mother. Thus, the correct answer is C: 50% chance.

Answer: C
