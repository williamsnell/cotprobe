Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about Kelsen’s theory of law, and we're supposed to choose the correct option based on his theory's characteristics. The options are A to J, but the choices given are A to D, so I'll focus on those.

First, I remember that Kelsen's theory is related to legal theory. I think he was a German philosopher, maybe a law professor or something? His work probably deals with the nature of law. Let me try to recall what I know about his theories.

Option A says Kelsen's theory is called pure because it's discussed jurisprudence only. I'm not sure. I think jurisprudence is about applying laws, but Kelsen might have a different approach. Maybe he's more about the underlying principles than the application?

Option B says he defined law according to morality and purity. That rings a bell. I think Kelsen's main focus was on morality as the foundation of law. So he probably believes law is moral and has a divine or intrinsic value. That would make option B likely correct.

Option C claims he separated law from religion, ethics, etc. That doesn't sound right. Kelsen, if I remember, was more about integrating law with morality and ethics, rather than separating it from other areas.

Option D says he discussed law purely in terms of justice. I think that's part of his work. He talked a lot about the role of justice in law, so maybe that's correct. Wait, but the question is about what makes his theory called 'pure'. So I need to see what makes his theory unique.

Wait, another thought. I think Kelsen's major work is "Der Wettbewerbsgesetzbuch," which I believe is about the laws of business. But the theory of law he developed, I think, is about the moral and religious basis of law. So maybe his theory is considered pure because it's grounded in morality and law's intrinsic value.

So looking back, the options: B and D are about the nature of law. D is about discussing it in terms of justice, but B is about morality and purity. So which is more about his theory's definition?

I think his theory is about the law being moral and having a pure, divine foundation, so option B would be the correct answer. It's about how law is defined according to morality and its purity. Option D is part of his approach but not the defining feature of the theory as pure.

The correct answer is:

**B: Defined law in accordance with morality and purity**

Kelsen’s theory of law is characterized as 'pure' because it is grounded in morality and its intrinsic value, which makes option B the correct choice. This aligns with his belief that law is moral and has a divine foundation.

**Answer: B**
