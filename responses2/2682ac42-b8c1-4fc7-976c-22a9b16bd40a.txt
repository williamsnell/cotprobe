Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the jurisdiction of court cases, and I'm supposed to pick the correct answer. Let me think through this carefully.

The question is: Which of the following is true of court cases in which one private party is suing another? The options are A to J.

I remember that in a civil case, the parties can go to either civil or criminal court, depending on the matter. If it's a civil matter, like a lawsuit for damages or settling disputes, then civil court is where it's usually tried. If it's criminal, like a defense against a crime, criminal court is used.

Looking at the options, option I says they're tried in civil court. That makes sense for civil cases where the parties are suing for relief or damages. Option J is about criminal court, but that's only for criminal cases. So for civil cases, civil court is the place, and criminal court is for when someone is suing for a criminal offense or defense.

So, for example, if someone is suing for a fine for violating a law, they'd go to criminal court. But if they're trying to recover money for a personal injury lawsuit, they'd go to civil court.

What's the difference between J and I? Well, J is about criminal trials, I is about civil. So the correct answers would include both I and J, but looking back, the options are single-choice. Wait, no, the question is which is true. So which of the options is correct.

Wait, the question asks "which of the following is true of court cases," implying that only one option is correct. So I need to see which of the options is a universally true statement about civil and criminal court.

Wait, let me think again. If a case is about a private party suing another, the court could be either civil or criminal, depending on the nature of the case. So the options for the correct answer would include both I and J. But wait, the options are presented as separate choices, so it's possible that the correct answers include multiple options, but in the given options, only one letter is correct.

Wait, no, the question is asking which of the options is true, so the correct answer would have to be a single choice that is correct. Let me look at each option again.

A: They are always resolved through arbitration, not court trials. No, that's not right. Arbitration is a method, not the method of resolution. Cases are usually tried in court, either civil or criminal.

B: They are always tried in the Supreme Court. No, that's incorrect. The Supreme Court handles cases at the highest level, but not all cases are tried there. For example, family matters might go to the federal court system, but not all cases. Also, criminal cases go to the federal court system. So B is not correct.

C: They are tried in juvenile court. No, juvenile court is for children, and cases are usually tried in adult courts, like civil or criminal.

D: They are tried in international court. No, international courts are for international cases, but individual cases are usually tried in domestic courts, unless it's a very high-profile case, but the options don't specify that. So D is incorrect.

E: The federal court system has exclusive jurisdiction over them. No, the federal court system has jurisdiction over federal and state cases, but not all cases. For example, state and federal cases are usually tried in the same court, so federal court doesn't have exclusive jurisdiction. So E is incorrect.

F: The state court system has exclusive jurisdiction over them. No, same issue as E. State and federal courts share jurisdiction. So F is incorrect.

G: They are exclusively tried in appellate court. No, appellate court is for cases that are decided by a three-judge panel, allowing for appeals. But the type of court (civil or criminal) and the method of resolution are determined by the nature of the case, not the jurisdiction.

H: The military court system has exclusive jurisdiction over them. No, military courts have jurisdiction over military cases, but individual cases are usually tried in state or federal courts.

I: They are tried in civil court. Yes, this is correct. For civil cases, civil court is used. So this option is a correct statement.

J: They are tried in criminal court. No, this is only correct for criminal cases, not all cases. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be I. But wait, the options are presented as options A to J, each being a separate claim. The question is, which of the following is true. So only one of the options is correct. Therefore, the correct option is I.

The correct answer is I: They are tried in civil court.

**Explanation:**
- In a civil case, the parties typically go to civil court, which is the appropriate venue. For example, a lawsuit seeking damages or settling disputes would be tried in civil court.
- For criminal cases, the parties are tried in criminal court, such as defending against a crime or serving as a defense.
- The options A to J are evaluated as follows:
  - A: Incorrect, as court cases are resolved in court, not arbitration.
  - B: Incorrect, as Supreme Court jurisdiction is not exclusive to all cases.
  - C: Incorrect, as juvenile court is for children, not private parties.
  - D: Incorrect, as international court jurisdiction is not exclusive to cases.
  - E: Incorrect, as federal court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over all cases.
  - F: Incorrect, as state court system also has jurisdiction over cases.
  - G: Incorrect, as appellate court is for cases to be retried, not exclusive.
  - H: Incorrect, as military court system has jurisdiction over military cases.
  - I: Correct, as civil cases are typically tried in civil court.
  - J: Incorrect, as criminal cases are tried in criminal court.

Thus, the only correct statement is I: They are tried in civil court.

**Answer:** I
