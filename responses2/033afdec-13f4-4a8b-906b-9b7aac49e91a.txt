Okay, so I need to approximate the area under the curve y=2^x from x=-1 to x=3 using the Trapezoidal rule with n=4 subintervals. Hmm, I remember the Trapezoidal rule is a method to estimate the integral by dividing the area under a curve into trapezoids. Each trapezoid approximates the area between two points.

Wait, first, let me recall the formula for the Trapezoidal rule. The general formula is (Δx/2) * [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + ... + 2f(xn-1) + f(xn)], where Δx is the width of each subinterval. Oh right, and we divide the interval into n equal parts.

The interval here is from x=-1 to x=3. So the first step is to find the width of each subinterval, Δx. Let me calculate that. The total width is 3 - (-1) = 4, and since n=4, each subinterval is 4/4 = 1. So Δx is 1.

Now I need to evaluate the function at the endpoints of each subinterval. The points will be at x=-1, x=0, x=1, x=2, and x=3. Because n=4, we'll have 5 points (including both endpoints).

Let me calculate f(x) at each of these points:

f(-1) = 2^(-1) = 1/2 = 0.5
f(0) = 2^0 = 1
f(1) = 2^1 = 2
f(2) = 2^2 =4
f(3)=2^3=8

Wait, wait. Let's list the points and their corresponding f(x):

x0 = -1, f(x0)=0.5
x1=0, f(x1)=1
x2=1, f(x2)=2
x3=2, f(x3)=4
x4=3, f(x4)=8

Now, applying the Trapezoidal formula. The formula is (Δx/2) * [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + f(x4)].

Plugging in the values:

(1/2) * [0.5 + 2*(1) + 2*(2) + 2*(4) + 8]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the terms inside the brackets:

0.5 is just 0.5.

2*(1) is 2.

2*(2) is 4.

2*(4) is 8.

And then there's +8 from f(x4).

So adding all these together:

0.5 + 2 = 2.5

2.5 + 4 = 6.5

6.5 +8 = 14.5

Then, add the last term, which is f(x4)=8: 14.5 +8 =22.5.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + 2f(x3) + f(x4)]. So the last term is f(x4) =8, which is added at the end.

Wait, but in the calculation I did, I included f(x4) as 8, but perhaps I shouldn't have included it in the same step as adding the other terms. Let me recount.

So the expression inside the brackets is sum = 0.5 + 2*(1) + 2*(2) + 2*(4) +8.

Wait, 2*(1) is 2, 2*(2)=4, 2*(4)=8. So the sum is 0.5 + 2 =2.5, plus 4 is 6.5, plus 8 is 14.5, plus 8 again? Wait, no, wait, no. Let me calculate it again.

Wait, the formula is (Δx/2) * [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2)+2f(x3) + f(x4)].

So f(x0) is 0.5, f(x1)=1, f(x2)=2, f(x3)=4, f(x4)=8.

So the sum is 0.5 + (2*1) + (2*2) + (2*4) +8.

Compute each multiplication:

2*1=2, 2*2=4, 2*4=8.

So the sum becomes 0.5 + 2 + 4 + 8 +8.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula includes f(x4), which is 8, so adding that.

So let me compute 0.5 + 2 = 2.5, plus 4 (2*2) is 6.5, plus 8 (2*4) is 14.5, plus 8 (f(x4)=8) is 22.5.

So the sum inside the brackets is 22.5.

Then, multiply by (Δx/2) = (1/2).

So (1/2) * 22.5 = 11.25.

Wait, so the area is approximately 11.25.

Looking at the options, that's option C:11.25.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes a small mistake can happen.

Wait, let me compute each term again.

f(-1)=0.5

f(0)=1, times 2: 2

f(1)=2, times 2:4

f(2)=4, times 2:8

f(3)=8.

So summing them all: 0.5 + 2 +4 +8 +8.

Wait, wait, that's 0.5 + (2+4+8) +8.

Wait, 2+4+8=14. So 0.5 + 14 =14.5, plus 8 is 22.5. So correct, sum is 22.5.

Multiply by (Δx/2): 1/2 *22.5=11.25.

So the answer should be C:11.25.

To approximate the area under the curve \( y = 2^x \) from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 3 \) using the Trapezoidal rule with \( n = 4 \) subintervals, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the width of each subinterval**:  
   The total width is \( 3 - (-1) = 4 \), and with \( n = 4 \), each subinterval width \( \Delta x = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \).

2. **Evaluate the function at the endpoints of each subinterval**:  
   The points are \( x = -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \), and the corresponding function values are:  
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   f(-1) &= 2^{-1} = 0.5, \\
   f(0) &= 2^0 = 1, \\
   f(1) &= 2^1 = 2, \\
   f(2) &= 2^2 = 4, \\
   f(3) &= 2^3 = 8.
   \end{align*}
   \]

3. **Apply the Trapezoidal rule formula**:  
   The formula is \( \frac{\Delta x}{2} \times [f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 2f(x_3) + f(x_4)] \). Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 0.5 + 2(1) + 2(2) + 2(4) + 8 = 0.5 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 8 = 22.5.
   \]  
   Then, multiply by \( \frac{\Delta x}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \):  
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 22.5 = 11.25.
   \]

4. **Select the correct option**:  
   The result is \( 11.25 \), which corresponds to option C.
