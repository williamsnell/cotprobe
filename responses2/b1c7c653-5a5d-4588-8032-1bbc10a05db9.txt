Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about research designs. Hmm, the question is asking which type of research there is no manipulation and variables are just measured. I remember from my studies that different research designs have different methods, like experimental, observational, correlational, etc.

Let me think about each option. The options are A through G. The question is asking which one fits the scenario where there's no manipulation, just measurement of variables.

Option A is Qualitative Research. I think qualitative is more about understanding concepts, phenomena, and people in a deeper way. They often use methods like interviews, observations, and coding. They don't manipulate variables but rather gather data through various methods. So this might be the answer because it's about observing rather than manipulating.

Option B is Exploratory Research. I recall that exploratory research is used to identify new areas or phenomena, and it's often done without much manipulation. They might just observe and collect data, looking for patterns. So this fits the description.

Option C is Longitudinal Research. That's when you study the same group over a period of time. They track changes and can measure variables over time. Definitely not just measurement; it's more about tracking changes. So this isn't the right answer.

Option D is True Experimental Research. This is where there's manipulation of the independent variable, and you have control groups. So it involves manipulation, so this is not the answer.

Option E is Quasi-Experimental Research. Similar to true experimental but doesn't have random assignment, random samples, or random assignment of participants. So it's not just measurement either.

Option F is Correlational Research. This measures relationships between variables, not necessarily establishing causality. It's about association, not manipulation.

Option G is Developmental Research. That's about how people develop over time, often looking at longitudinal changes. Variables are measured over time, so this is not it.

So, putting it all together: the question is about no manipulation, just variables measured. Qualitative (A) measures through non-manipulation methods, exploratory (B) is about finding patterns without much manipulation. Both A and B fit. Wait, the question says "no manipulation" and "variables are just measured." Qualitative and exploratory both don't involve manipulation. But the options are singular.

Looking back at the question, I think the question is asking for a type where variables are measured, not manipulated. So, both A and B are correct, but looking at the options, there's no option that combines A and B. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are single letters. So the correct answer must be one option. Let me think again. The question is about which type of research doesn't involve manipulation. Both Qualitative and Exploratory don't involve manipulation. But in the options, the choices are singular, so perhaps only one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is a bit tricky. Let me think about the wording: "no manipulation of research done and variables are just measured." So the correct answer is the type where variables are measured, not manipulated.

Both Qualitative and Exploratory fit this description. But looking at the options, the options are single letters, so which one is the correct one? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the question is about which type has no manipulation and variables measured. So both A and B fit, but the options are separate. So perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be either A or B.

Wait, the options are labeled A through G. The question is asking which type is correct. Since both A and B fit, but the options are single letters. Oh wait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but in reality, I think in some contexts, Exploratory is a type of qualitative research where variables are measured without manipulation, and Qualitative is a broader category. But in this case, the question is asking for the type where variables are just measured, not manipulated.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about each term.

Qualitative research is a broad category that includes various methods, such as thematic analysis, content analysis, and interviews. It's often used to understand the 'why' or 'how' of phenomena, not through manipulation. So this is a type where variables are measured, not manipulated. So A is a correct answer.

Exploratory Research is about discovering patterns and relationships without manipulation. So variables are measured, but not manipulated. So B is also correct.

Wait, so if I have to choose between A and B, perhaps both are correct. But the options are single letters, so perhaps it's a matter of which is the best fit. Maybe the question is looking for a specific type.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit tricky, and only one of the options is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about what each term means in the context of research design.

In Experimental Research, manipulation occurs. So D and E are out.

In Longitudinal Research, variables are being measured over time, so C is out.

Correlational (F) and Developmental (G) are about relationships, not just measurement.

So between A and B, both are correct, but the options are exclusive. Wait, the question is about which type has no manipulation and variables measured. So both A and B fit this description, but the options are single letters.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit more specific. Let me think about the definitions again.

Exploratory Research is a type of research where the focus is to explore and discover new knowledge. It's often used in the early stages of research, not involving manipulation. It's not an experimental design.

Qualitative Research is a broader category, and it's not just about measurement. It can involve both quantitative and qualitative methods. So it's about understanding concepts and phenomena, which doesn't involve manipulation.

Wait, but the question is about which type of research where there's no manipulation. Both A and B fit, but each is a different type. So perhaps the correct answer is A because it's a type where variables are measured, not manipulated, but it's a broader category.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting one of the options to be correct. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is probably A or B.

Wait, but the question states that the type is one of these options. So perhaps the correct answer is A: Qualitative Research, or B: Exploratory Research.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "which type of research," implying a single answer. So perhaps the intended answer is A: Qualitative Research.

Alternatively, another approach: the question is about research where there's no manipulation. So both A (Qualitative) and B (Exploratory) fit. Wait, but how can there be two correct answers in this context? That can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Because I remember that Qualitative Research is a type where variables are measured, not manipulated. So A would be the answer.

But I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, I should think about the options again.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the type of research where variables are measured, not manipulated. So, that's a broad category. Both A and B are part of that set.

But since the options are single letters, perhaps the intended answer is A: Qualitative Research. Because it's the most general term, and both A and B are correct, but only A is a type of that general category.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: Exploratory Research.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about examples.

Qualitative Research: For instance, a study might focus on the experiences of participants, not manipulating anything. They might just observe and document. But it's not just about measurement; it's about understanding through the lens of participants' experiences.

Exploratory Research: This is often used in the early stages of research to identify trends or relationships. It's about discovering patterns, not manipulating variables. So they collect data, and then they analyze it to find relationships, but they don't manipulate variables.

So both A and B are correct types. But the options are single letters. I'm probably overcomplicating this. Since the question is looking for the type where variables are just measured, not manipulated, perhaps the answer is A: qualitative.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the question is which type of research has no manipulation and variables measured. Both A and B fit.

Wait, but considering the options, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which of the options includes only measurement without manipulation. So, in that case, option A is qualitative, which is about understanding through description, not manipulation. So the answer is A.
</think>

The question asks for the type of research where there is no manipulation and variables are just measured. Both qualitative (A) and exploratory (B) research fit this description, as they involve measurement without manipulation. However, since the options are single letters, the most appropriate answer is A: Qualitative Research, as it encompasses a broader category of research where variables are measured, not manipulated.

Answer: A
