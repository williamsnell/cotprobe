Question:

A typical bacterial cell has a cell wall and plasma membrane. If the cell wall is removed by treatment withlysozyme, an enzyme that selectively dissolves the cell wall material, will the bacteria live? Explain. What is the biochemicaldifference between the cell walls of bacteria, and plants?

Options:

A: The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is equal to the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of insoluble peptidoglycan, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.
B: The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall, as the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand osmotic pressure. The cell wall of bacteria is similar to that of plants, both composed of cellulose.
C: The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall as long as it is provided with an external structural support. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, distinct from the cellulose-based cell walls of plants.
D: The cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of peptidoglycan.
E: The bacterial cell can only live without its cell wall in a hypertonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is higher outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of chitin, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.
F: The bacterial cell can survive without its cell wall in a hypotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is lower outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is made of glycoproteins, in contrast to the cellulose in plant cell walls.
G: The bacterial cell cannot survive without its cell wall in any circumstances.
H: The cell wall of bacteria is composed of lipids.
I: The bacterial cell wall can regenerate quickly after removal, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily. The biochemical difference is that bacterial cell walls have a higher lipid content compared to the cellulose-rich cell walls of plants.
J: The bacterial cell cannot live without its cell wall because it provides essential nutrients. The cell walls of bacteria are made primarily of lignin, whereas plant cell walls are composed of cellulose and lignin.

Okay, so I've got this question about bacterial cells and cell walls. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let's try to figure this out. 

The question is asking two parts. First, if the cell wall is removed using lysozyme, will the bacteria live? Second, it's asking about the biochemical difference between bacterial cell walls and plant cell walls.

Let me start with the first part. I remember that bacteria typically have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, which is a complex carbohydrate structure. When the cell wall is removed, the bacteria lose this structural support. But I'm a bit confused about whether that's enough.

Cell walls are important for bacterial survival because they provide structure and protection against osmotic stress. If the wall is gone, the bacteria might be vulnerable to certain conditions. For example, if the environment is hypotonic (low osmolarity), the bacteria might lose water and die because the cell wall's structure isn't there to hold them together. But if the medium is hypertonic (high osmolarity), the bacteria might survive because the cell walls can withstand the higher external pressure.

Wait, but lysozyme is an enzyme that can break down cell walls. So if the cell wall is removed, the bacteria don't have the protective cells anymore. So would that make them susceptible to death? I think that without the cell wall, the bacteria might die more easily, but I'm not sure. Maybe in some cases, they can survive. But I'm not certain. I'll come back to this.

Now, the second part of the question is about the biochemical difference between bacterial cell walls and plant cell walls. I remember that plant cell walls have cellulose, which is a carbohydrate. Bacteria have peptidoglycan, which is a glycolipid composed of peptide bonds and carbohydrate units. So, the main difference is that bacteria use glycolipids (peptidoglycan) while plants use glycolipids and lipids (cellulose).

Wait, but what about other differences? Bacteria don't have a peptidoglycan in the same way. They have a complex structure but without the sugar units. So their cell walls are more like a gelatinous substance without the glycolipid bonds. For plants, cell walls are made of a combination of carbohydrate (cellulose) and lipids (like果胶), which makes them stronger and more durable.

So looking at the options, option B says bacteria's cell walls are similar to plants' both are made of cellulose. That can't be right because bacteria don't have that. Option C says the cell wall is a mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, which is right. But the cell wall of bacteria is composed of insoluble peptidoglycan, which is a glycolipid, not proteins. So option C might be incorrect. Hmm.

Looking at option B: "The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall, as the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand osmotic pressure." Wait, but the plasma membrane is the cell membrane. If the cell wall is gone, the cell membrane would collapse. The cell membrane is the outer layer, not the same as the cell wall. So the cell wall is a structural part, the membrane is the outer layer.

But regardless, the cell wall's structure is important. So if the cell wall is gone, the cell would lose its structural support. Unless the osmotic pressure is low enough, the cell might die. But if lysozyme is used, which breaks down the cell wall, then the cell would have nothing to hold it together. So the bacteria can't survive without the cell wall. But wait, the question is whether the bacteria will live. So, without the cell wall, they can't survive, so the answer to the first part would be no.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The cell wall provides structural support. If it's removed, the cell is more vulnerable to osmotic stress. In a hypotonic environment, the cell might lose water and die. If the medium is hypertonic, then the cell's osmotic pressure might be higher, so the cell could survive, but maybe the cell wall's strength is compromised, so it can't hold the cell together.

Alternatively, if the medium is more concentrated than the cell's own, then the cell wall might not help, but the cell's own osmotic pressure could cause the cell to die. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

So the first part: If the cell wall is removed, can the bacteria survive? I think the answer is no, because the cell wall provides structural integrity. But I'm not certain. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options, option E and I mention differences between bacterial and plant cell walls. Option E says the bacterial cell wall can't survive without it in a hypertonic medium, but E's first part is opposite. Wait, no. Option F says hypotonic, cell walls can survive. Option E says the opposite: in hypotonic, cell walls can't survive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: If the cell wall is present, the cell can survive in a hypertonic medium because the cell wall can withstand the high osmotic pressure. Without the cell wall, the cell might die in a hypotonic medium (because it loses water easily) or in a hypertonic medium (because the cell wall might not hold it together, and the osmotic pressure is higher, causing the cell to die).

Wait, but if the cell is just getting the cell wall removed, perhaps the cell membrane is intact, but the cell wall is gone. So the cell would be more fragile.

Wait, but the first part says, "will the bacteria live? Explain." So if the cell wall is removed, do they still survive? I think they won't, because the cell wall is a structural protein. So the answer to the first part is no, the bacteria will not survive if the cell wall is removed. So the first part's answer is 'No, the bacteria will not live without the cell wall.'

Looking at the options, which one says the bacteria will die? Let me look.

Option B says the bacteria will immediately die. Option F says in a hypotonic medium, the cell can't survive. Since the cell wall is gone, the cell would be more susceptible to osmotic stress.

So if the medium is hypotonic (low osmolarity), the cell would lose water and die because the cell wall's structure isn't there to hold it. So the bacteria would die, so the answer is no.

Wait, but the question is phrased as 'will the bacteria live? Explain.' So the answer is that they won't live. So the options that say 'no' would be the correct choice.

Looking at the options, option B says the bacteria will immediately die. Option F says in a hypotonic medium, the cell walls can't survive. So option F is about the bacteria not surviving in a hypotonic medium. So if the medium is hypotonic, the cell wall is gone, so the cell might die. So without the cell wall, the cell would be more vulnerable.

But the first part is about whether the bacteria will live if the cell wall is removed. So the answer is no. So the options that say 'no' are the correct answers.

Looking at the options, option B and option F are about whether the bacteria can survive or die in certain conditions.

So the first part's answer is 'No, the bacteria will not live without the cell wall.' So the options that say the bacteria can't survive are the ones that are correct.

Looking at the options, option B: "The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall." Option F: "The bacterial cell wall cannot survive without the cell wall in a hypotonic medium." Wait, option F's part is actually the opposite. Option F says, in a hypotonic medium, the cell walls can't survive. But if the cell wall is gone, the cell would be more susceptible to osmotic stress. So in a hypotonic medium, the cell would die because the cell wall is gone, and perhaps the cell membrane is intact but the cell wall is gone, meaning it can't hold it together.

Wait, but I think the cell would lose cell wall structure. So without the cell wall, the cell membrane would collapse, and the cell would be more vulnerable to osmotic stress. So in a hypotonic medium, the cell would die because the cell wall can't support the cell. So the first part's answer is that the bacteria die. So the option that says they can't survive without the cell wall, when the environment is hypotonic, would be correct.

Looking at the options, option F says the bacteria can't survive without the cell wall in a hypotonic medium. But the first part is about whether the bacteria can live. So if the medium is hypotonic, the cell walls can't survive. So the answer would be 'no, the bacteria can't survive.' So the option that says 'the bacteria can't survive without the cell wall in a hypotonic medium' is correct.

So the answer to the first part is that the bacteria can't survive. So looking for an option that says 'the bacteria will not live' or 'they can't survive.' So options B, F, etc.

Now the second part: the biochemical difference between bacterial cell walls and plant cell walls.

I remember that plants have both cellulose (a carbohydrate) and other components like果胶 (a glycolipid). Bacteria do not have such a structure. Their cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, which is a glycolipid composed of peptide bonds and carbohydrate units. So the main difference is that bacteria have a glycolipid structure (peptidoglycan), while plants have a combination of carbohydrate (cellulose) and lipids (like glycoproteins and果胶).

Looking at the options, which one correctly states that? Let's see:

Option B says: 'The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall, as the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand osmotic pressure. The cell wall of bacteria is similar to that of plants, both composed of cellulose.'

Wait, that's incorrect because the cell wall in bacteria is not similar to plant cell walls. So option B is wrong.

Option C says: 'The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall as long as it is provided with an external structural support. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, distinct from the cellulose-based cell walls of plants.'

Wait, proteins are in the cell wall? I thought that's not right. Bacteria don't have proteins. Their cell walls are composed of glycolipids (peptidoglycan). So option C is incorrect because it says 'proteins and carbohydrates,' which is wrong.

Wait, but option C's first part is correct in that if provided with structural support, bacteria can live. But the cell wall is not proteins.

Looking at option G: 'The bacterial cell cannot survive without its cell wall in any circumstances.' That's not true because the cell wall provides structural support, which is vital.

Option H: The cell wall is made of lipids. No, bacteria have glycolipids (peptidoglycan), so their cell walls are glycolipids.

Option I: Bacteria can quickly regenerate after losing cell walls, allowing them to survive without it. That seems correct because if the cell wall is removed, the cell can shed the structural parts. However, I thought that the cell wall isn't easily shed, but it can be broken down, perhaps.

Wait, but the first part says that without the cell wall, the bacteria can't survive. If the cell can shed its structural support, perhaps they can survive. So the second part's correct is that the cell wall's structure is different.

Looking back, the correct biochemical difference is that Bacteria have glycolipids (peptidoglycan), while plants have a mix of cellulose and glycoproteins. So which option reflects that?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Both are cellulos. Incorrect.

Option C: The first part is correct about structural support but the cell wall is wrong.

Option F: The part about hypotonic medium is correct, but the entire statement is about cell walls.

Wait, the second part is about the difference between bacterial and plant cell walls.

Looking for an option that says that. Option B says 'similar to plant's, both cellulose.' No, that's incorrect.

Option H says the wall is made of lipids, which is wrong.

Option I: says the cell wall can regenerate quickly. That's true, but the question is about the biochemical difference, not the function.

Option J: talk about lignin, which is a carbohydrate. But bacteria don't have lignin, so this is wrong.

So the correct options are B, C, D, F, G, etc.

Wait, the question's second part is about the difference. The correct answer is that the bacterial cell walls are made of glycolipids (peptidoglycan) and plant cell walls have a combination of cellulose and glycoproteins.

So looking for the option that says that. Let's check the options.

Looking at option B: 'The bacterial cell will immediately die... The wall is similar to plant, both cellulos.' No, that's incorrect.

Option C: 'The cell can live without support, the cell wall is a mixture of proteins and carbs, which is wrong.'

Option D: says the cell wall is made of peptidoglycan. But that's plant's. Wait, D says 'the cell wall can regenerate quickly.' So correct part is that the cell can shed the wall, but the second part is about the difference.

Wait, the second part is 'the difference between bacterial and plant cell walls.' So the correct option would be the one that says, for example, that the bacterial cell's cell wall is a glycolipid (peptidoglycan) and plants have cellulose and glycoproteins.

Looking again, option B: no, because the description is wrong.

Option C: incorrect because cell wall is not proteins.

Option H: cell wall is lipids - incorrect.

Option J: cell wall uses lignin, which is a carbohydrate, but not correct.

So perhaps the correct option is none of them. But wait, looking at the options, option I is about regeneration. I think the second part of the question is about the structure difference. So perhaps the correct answer is that the cell walls are made from different components.

Wait, looking at option B, the first part: 'the cell will immediately die' - perhaps that's not correct. But option F says, 'the cell walls can't survive without the cell wall in a hypotonic medium.' That's correct.

So if the condition is hypotonic medium, the cell walls can't survive, so the bacteria can't live. So the correct answer to the first part is that the bacteria cannot survive.

But the question's first part is a yes/no about whether they can live. So the answer is no, they can't. So the options that say 'No' are correct.

Looking at the options, option B says the cell will immediately die. Option F says in a hypotonic, cell walls can't survive. So both options say the bacteria can't survive. But the question is about the answer, not which is correct.

But the question is a two-part question. So the first part is whether the bacteria will live, and the second is the difference.

Wait, but the options can't all be correct. Let me re-examine the options.

Looking at option E: 'The bacterial cell wall can't survive in a hypertonic medium, but the cell wall of plants can. But the answer is about the difference between the two. So I think that's not the correct one.

Option I says the cell wall can regenerate quickly. So correct part is that the cell can shed the wall, but the second part is about the difference.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option I: 'The cell can regenerate quickly, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily.' So the biochemical difference is about the structure. The first part, the answer is bacteria can't live without the cell wall, so the answer to the first part is no. But the options are about the answer to the first part.

Wait, perhaps the first part's answer is 'No, the bacteria will not live without the cell wall.' So looking for an option that says that.

Looking again, option B says 'will immediately die' (so it's correct, but the bacteria can't survive, so the first part is 'no' and the second part is the difference.

Wait, perhaps the first part's answer is that the bacteria can't live, so the correct option is the one that says the bacteria can't survive without the cell wall, either in a certain condition. So the correct answer for the first part is 'no, they can't live', so the options that have 'they can't survive' would be correct.

Looking at the options:

Option B: says they will die. So the correct answer to the first part is 'No, they can't live.'

So looking for the first part's correct option. Let me look again.

Option B says: "The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall..." So that's correct for the first part.

Option F: "The bacterial cell wall can't survive without the cell wall in a hypotonic medium."

So both B and F are correct for their respective parts.

Wait, but the question is asking two things. So the answer should include both. But the options are single-answer choices, so perhaps the correct answer to the entire question is option I, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is a two-part question. The first part is a yes/no about whether the bacteria will live if the cell wall is removed. The second part is the difference between bacterial and plant cell walls.

The options have several possible answers. So the correct overall answer is the one that correctly answers both parts.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, thinking about it again. If the cell wall is removed, the bacteria are more vulnerable to osmotic stress. Because the cell wall provides structural support, without it, the cell membrane is more susceptible. So the bacteria can't survive in such conditions, so the answer to the first part is 'No.'

Now looking at the options that say the bacteria can't survive, like option B, or the cell can't survive in certain media like option F.

Wait, option B says the bacteria will immediately die. Since the cell wall is gone, the bacteria would die in a hypotonic medium because they lose water. So option B is correct for the first part.

But the second part of the question is about the difference between bacterial and plant cell walls. So looking for the correct option, perhaps option I is correct because the cell can regenerate quickly.

Wait, option I says the cell can quickly regenerate, so bacteria can survive if the cell wall is gone temporarily.

But the first part's answer is correct in option B. But the question is about the two parts. So the correct option to the entire question would be the one that correctly answers both parts.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to make a decision.

The first part's correct answer is 'No, they can't live.' So the options that say they can't live are B and F.

But the second part's correct answer is about the difference between bacterial and plant cell walls.

Looking for an option that correctly says that. Option B says the cells are similar, which is incorrect. Option I says the cell can regenerate quickly. That's correct for the second part.

But the question is a two-part question. So the correct answer is option I, but that's part of the second question.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but that's not directly answering the first part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I think the correct answer is that the bacteria can't survive without the cell wall. So the correct option for the first part is B or F.

The correct option for the second part is option I, because the cell can quickly regenerate.

Wait, but the question's second part is about the difference between bacterial and plant cell walls. So the correct answer is option I's first part, but the second part is about the difference.

Wait, but the options for the second part are not given.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, and the first part is option B.

Wait, but the question is a single question with two parts. So the options given are the possible answers for the whole question.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, and the first part is option B.

But I'm getting confused. I think the correct answer to the first part is 'No, the bacteria will not live without the cell wall.' So the correct option is the one that says they can't survive.

Looking at the options, option B and F are the ones that say they can't survive.

Option B says the cell will die. Option F says... in a hypotonic medium, they can't survive.

So both B and F are correct for their parts, but the question is a two-part question, so the correct answer is both.

But I'm not sure how the options are structured. Perhaps the correct option is B, but the second part is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, and the first part is option B.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think of the correct answers for both parts.

So for the first part: the bacteria can't survive without the cell wall. So the correct option is either B or F.

For the second part: the cell walls of bacteria and plants are different. The correct option is something that correctly states that.

Looking at option B: 'The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall.' So correct for the first part.

But what about the second part?

The correct answer for the second part is that the bacterial cell walls are made of glycolipids (peptidoglycan), while plant cell walls have a combination of cellulose and glycoproteins.

Looking for the option that correctly states that. Option B says 'both cellulos.' No. Option I says the cell wall can regenerate, but that's part of the second question.

So the correct answer is option I: 'The cell can regenerate quickly, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily.'

But the first part's correct option is B.

Wait, but the options are in the question, so the correct answer is option I, but the first part is option B.

Wait, but in the given options, perhaps the correct answer is option B for the first part and option I for the second part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, and the first part is option B.

But I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is that the bacteria can't survive without the cell wall, and the difference between bacterial and plant cell walls is that the former are made of glycolipids and the latter have cellulose and glycoproteins.

So looking for the option that correctly states that.

Option B: 'The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall.' Correct for the first part.

Option I: 'The cell can regenerate quickly, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily.' Correct for the second part.

So the correct overall answer is option I.

Wait, but the question is phrased as a two-part question. So the correct answer is option I, and the first part is correct.

Wait, but the options are single-answer choices. So perhaps the correct answer is option I, but the first part is option B.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I for the second part and option B for the first.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should select option I as the correct answer for the second part.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but the first part's correct option is B.

But I'm not confident. I think the correct answer to the first part is option B, and the correct answer to the second part is option I.

But I'm not sure. I think I'll go with option I as the correct answer for the second part, but the first part is option B.
</think>

The question involves two parts: whether bacterial cells can survive without their cell walls and the biochemical difference between bacterial and plant cell walls. Here's the breakdown:

### First Part: Survival Without Cell Walls  
- **Option B:** Correct. The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall.  
- **Option F:** Correct. The bacterial cell wall cannot survive in a hypotonic medium.  

Both options correctly address the first part of the question, but the question is structured as a two-part question, so the correct overall answer will consider both parts.

### Second Part: Biochemical Difference  
- **Option I:** Correct. The bacterial cell can regenerate quickly, allowing the bacteria to survive without the cell wall temporarily.  

### Conclusion  
- The correct answer to the first part is **Option B**, indicating that the bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall.  
- The correct answer to the second part is **Option I**, indicating that the bacterial cell can regenerate quickly, allowing the bacteria to survive without the cell wall temporarily.  

Thus, the overall correct answer is **Option I**, as it correctly addresses the second part of the question.  

ANSWER: I
