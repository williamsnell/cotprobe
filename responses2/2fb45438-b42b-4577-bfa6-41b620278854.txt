Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Miranda enlarging a picture. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long. The new picture is 10 cm wide, and I need to find its length. 

Alright, so first, proportional enlargement means that the new picture is a scaled-up version of the original. So the ratio of the new width to the original width should be the same for the length. That makes sense because if one dimension increases, the other must increase by the same factor to keep the picture looking the same.

So, the original width is 4 cm and the new is 10 cm. Let me find out the scale factor. I think I can calculate it by dividing the new width by the original. So that's 10 divided by 4. Let me compute that. 10 รท 4 is 2.5. So the scale factor is 2.5 times bigger.

Now, applying this scale factor to the original length, which is 6 cm. I should multiply 6 cm by 2.5 to find the new length. Let me do that math. 6 times 2.5. Hmm, 6 * 2 is 12, and 6 * 0.5 is 3, so adding them gives 15. So the new length should be 15 cm.

Looking at the options, option B is 15 cm. So that should be the answer.

The scale factor is 10 cm / 4 cm = 2.5. Applying this to the original length of 6 cm: 6 cm * 2.5 = 15 cm. The correct option is **B: 15 cm**.

Answer: B
