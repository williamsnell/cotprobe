Okay, so I need to figure out how many trees there are on 5 labeled vertices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on graph theory, but I'll try to recall. Trees are connected acyclic graphs, right? And for labeled vertices, each tree corresponds to a specific structure.

I remember something about Cayley's formula. Let me think. Oh wait, Cayley's formula states that the number of labeled trees on n vertices is n^(n-2). So for n=5, that would be 5^(5-2) = 5^3. Let me calculate that: 5*5*5 is 125. So the number of trees should be 125.

Looking at the options, option F is 125. So the correct answer should be F.

The number of labeled trees on 5 vertices is calculated using **Cayley's formula**, which states that the number of such trees is \(n^{n-2}\). For \(n=5\), this is \(5^{3} = 125\). Among the options provided, the correct answer is **F: 125**.

Answer: F
