Okay, so I've got this question about the normalized power of a periodic signal. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question says the normalized power S is given by the sum from n=-infinity to +infinity of V_n squared. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the equation is written as S = sum_{n=-infty}^{+infty} V_n V_n, which I think is a typo and should be V_n squared. So S is the sum of V_n squared over all n.

And each V_n is (1/|n|) multiplied by e^{-j arctan(n/2) f} for n = ±1, ±2, etc. Wait, so V_n is a complex exponential, right? So the magnitude of V_n is probably (1/|n|), since the magnitude of e^{-j theta} is 1.

So the normalized power S is the sum over all n of (V_n)^2. Since |V_n| is (1/|n|), then |V_n|^2 is (1/|n|^2). So S is the sum from n = -infty to +infty of (1/|n|^2). But wait, n can't be 0 because 1/0 is undefined. Oh, but wait, the question says n = ±1, ±2, ..., so n=0 is excluded. So the sum starts from n=1 and counts both positive and negative n.

Let me write that out. So S is the sum from n=1 to +infty of (1/n^2) + (1/n^2) for each n, but wait, n is positive and negative, but since n squared is same for n and -n, each term (except n=0) appears twice. Wait, but wait, in the question, it's from n=-infty to +infty, but n=0 is excluded? Or is n=0 included?

Wait, the question says V_n is defined for n = ±1, ±2, etc. So n can be any integer except zero. So for each positive n, there's a corresponding negative n. So the sum S is over all n ≠ 0, which is the same as 2 times the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n².

Wait, but the sum from n=1 to ∞ of 1/n² is a known value. I remember that ∑1/n² from n=1 to ∞ is π²/6, but wait, I think that's the sum for n=1 to ∞ of 1/n², which is about 1.6449… but wait, no, wait, π²/6 is approximately 1.6449. Or wait, wait, another thought: the sum for n=1 to ∞ of 1/n^2 is 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ... which is approximately 1.6449.

So if S is the sum over all n ≠ 0 of 1/n², then S = 2*(1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + ...) = 2*(π²/6) or 2*(sum from n=1 to ∞ of 1/n²). Wait, but wait, no, because for n=1, 1/n² is 1, n=2 is 1/4, etc., so the sum for n=1 to infinity of 1/n^2 is 1.6449.

But wait, let me double-check: the sum of 1/n² from n=1 to ∞ is π²/6. So, so S, which is the sum over all n≠0 of 1/n², would be 2*(π²/6) = π²/3. So S = π²/3.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first harmonic. So for that, I need to find the normalized power for the first harmonic and the second harmonic.

Wait, what's the first harmonic? The first harmonic is the first non-zero frequency, which would be n=1. The second harmonic would be n=2.

So V_1 is the first harmonic, V_2 is the second harmonic. But wait, the power at each harmonic is |V_n|^2. So for harmonic 1, it's |V_1|^2 which is (1/1)^2 = 1. For harmonic 2, it's |V_2|^2 which is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, wait, but wait: V_1 is (1/|1|) e^{-j arctan(1/2) f} and V_2 is (1/|2|) e^{-j arctan(2/2) f} = (1/2) e^{-j arctan(1) f}.

So the normalized power for each harmonic is the magnitude squared of their V_n. So for the first harmonic, it's (1)^2 = 1. For the second harmonic, it's (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait a second, but wait, is that the case? Because V_1 is 1/1 times e^{...}, right? So |V_1|^2 is (1/1)^2 * |e^{-j theta}|² = 1 * 1 = 1. Similarly, |V_2|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So the normalized power for the first harmonic is 1, and for the second harmonic is 1/4.

Wait, but that would give a ratio of (1/4)/1 = 1/4. But looking at the options, I don't see 1/4. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, the question says to calculate the ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first harmonic. So that's (s2)/(s1), where s2 is the second harmonic's power, s1 the first.

But according to my earlier calculation, s1 = 1, s2 = 1/4. So s2/s1 = 1/4. But that's 0.25, which is option E.

But wait, wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about how the harmonics are defined. Because harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. So, if the fundamental is at n=1, then harmonics are at n=1, 2, 3, etc.

But wait, the problem says "normalized power of a periodic signal" given by the sum of V_n^2. So each V_n is a complex exponent, but the power is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing the fact that V_n is (1/|n|) e^{-j arctan(n/2) f}.

Wait, so for n=1, V_1 is (1/1)*e^{-j theta_1 f}, where theta_1 = arctan(1/2). So the magnitude is 1. So |V_1|^2 is 1² = 1.

n=2: V_2 is (1/2) e^{-j theta_2 f}, theta_2 = arctan(2/2) = arctan(1) = π/4. So |V_2|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So the normalized power for first harmonic is 1, and for second harmonic is 1/4. So the ratio s2/s1 is (1/4)/1 = 1/4, which is 0.25. So the ratio is 0.25, which is option E. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 0.25, which would correspond to that.

But wait, the question says V_n is (1/|n|) e^{-j arctan(n/2) f}.

Wait, so for n=2, arctan(2/2) is arctan(1) which is 45 degrees, so yes, the magnitude is 1/2.

So the normalized power for the first harmonic is 1, for the second harmonic is 1/4. So the ratio is 1/4.

But wait, the options have option E as 0.25, which is 1/4. So the ratio is 0.25, option E.

But wait, wait the options don't include 1/4 directly? Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: 0.125

B:1.5

C:0.75

D:0.5

E:0.25

F:4

G:0.6

H:1

I:0.25 (same as E)

J:3

Wait, then E is 0.25, so the ratio is 0.25, which is E.

Wait, but hold on, earlier I thought S was the sum from n=1 to ∞ 2*(1/n^2) which would be 2*(π²/6) ≈ (1.6449 * 2) ≈ 3.2898, but that's the total sum S. But wait, the question is about the ratio of the second harmonic to the first. So s2 is the power at n=2, which is 1/4, and s1 is 1. So their ratio is 0.25.

So the correct answer is E, 0.25.

The problem involves calculating the ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first harmonic for a periodic signal. The normalized power \( S \) is given by the sum of the squared magnitudes of the complex exponentials \( V_n \), where \( V_n = \frac{1}{|n|} e^{-j \arctan(n/2)f} \) for \( n = \pm1, \pm2, \dots \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Magnitude of \( V_n \):**  
   The magnitude of each \( V_n \) is \( \frac{1}{|n|} \), as the exponential term has magnitude 1.

2. **Normalized Power \( S \):**  
   The normalized power is the sum of the squared magnitudes:  
   \[
   S = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |V_n|^2 = 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}
   \]  
   (The factor of 2 accounts for both positive and negative values of \( n \), excluding \( n = 0 \).)  
   The sum \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \) is known to be \( \frac{\pi^2}{6} \), so:  
   \[
   S = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{6} = \frac{\pi^2}{3}
   \]

3. **Normalized Power for First and Second Harmonics:**  
   - For the first harmonic (\( n = 1 \)):  
     \[
     |V_1|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{1}\right)^2 = 1
     \]  
   - For the second harmonic (\( n = 2 \)):  
     \[
     |V_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

4. **Ratio of Second Harmonic to First Harmonic:**  
   The ratio is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{\text{Normalized power (second harmonic)}}{\text{Normalized power (first harmonic)}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{1} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
   \]

### Conclusion:  
The ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first harmonic is \( 0.25 \), which corresponds to option **E**.
