Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the markup in dollars. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. So the question says that a dress sells for $50.00 and has a 40% markup based on the selling price. I need to find out how much the markup is in dollars.

Hmm, I remember that markup is the amount added to the cost price to get the selling price. But wait, the problem says the markup is 40% based on the selling price. That's a bit different from what I usually hear. Usually, markup is based on the cost price, right? Like, for example, if something costs $100 and you mark it up by 50%, it becomes $150. But here, it's based on the selling price. So the markup is 40% of the selling price.

Let me think. So if the selling price is $50, then the markup would be 40% of $50. To calculate that, I can multiply 40% (which is 0.4) by $50. 

So, 0.4 multiplied by 50. Let's do the math: 0.4 * 50 = 20. So the markup is $20.00.

Looking at the options, option C is $20.00. So I think that's the right answer. Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, 'based on' can be tricky. Let me think again. If the markup is 40% of the selling price, then yes, it's 40% × 50 = 20. So the markup is $20.

The markup is calculated by taking 40% of the selling price. 

40% of $50.00 is 0.4 × 50 = $20.00.

The correct answer is C: $20.00.

Answer: C
