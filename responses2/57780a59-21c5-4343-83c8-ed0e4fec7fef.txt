Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the Earth as a uniform solid sphere. Then all of its mass is suddenly moved into a thin-walled hollow spherical shell with the same radius. I need to find out how long it takes for the new Earth to rotate on its axis and what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost.

Hmm, wait, so initially, Earth is a solid sphere, and then it becomes a thin-walled shell. So I need to figure out the new angular velocity and the moment of inertia change, right?

I remember that the moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5)MR², and for a thin-walled shell, it's MR². Oh wait, but wait, no. Wait, the thin-walled shell's moment of inertia is actually (2/3)MR². Let me confirm that.

So, initial moment of inertia (I_initial) = (2/5) M R².

After moving all mass into a thin-walled shell, the new moment of inertia (I_final) = M R².

Wait, no. Wait, mass is the same. So M is the same, R is the same. So I_initial is (2/5)MR², I_final is MR².

Now, angular momentum should be conserved, right? Because no external torque is acting on the system (assuming Earth is isolated). So initial angular momentum (L_initial) = I_initial * ω_initial.

After the change, L_final = I_final * ω_final.

So, since L_initial = L_final, (2/5)MR² * ω_initial = MR² * ω_final.

Wait, let's compute that. Let me rearrange for ω_final.

ω_final = (2/5) * R² * M * ω_initial / (M R² )

Wait, let me write it correctly. 

I_initial = (2/5) M R².

I_final = M R².

So,

ω_final = (I_initial / I_final) * ω_initial.

So,

ω_final = ( (2/5) M R² ) / ( M R² ) ) * ω_initial.

Hmm, the M and R² cancel.

So, (2/5) * ω_initial.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when you move mass from a solid sphere to a shell, the moment of inertia increases. So if I_initial is (2/5)MR², and I_final is MR², then I_final is larger by a factor of 5/2.

Wait, wait, no. 2/5 is less than 1, so I_final would be larger than I_initial. So ω_final would be less than ω_initial. Let's see.

Wait, no, because I_initial is (2/5)M R², I_final is M R². So I_final is (M R²) / (2/5 M R²) ) = 5/2 times I_initial.

So, I_final = (5/2) I_initial.

So, in terms of angular velocity, L_initial = I_initial ω_initial. L_final = I_final ω_final.

Since L_initial = L_final, I_initial ω_initial = I_final ω_final.

So ω_final = (I_initial / I_final) * ω_initial.

Substituting I_final = (5/2) I_initial,

ω_final = (I_initial) / (5/2 I_initial) * ω_initial = (2/5) ω_initial.

Wait, so the new angular velocity is 2/5 of the original. That makes sense because the moment of inertia increased, so to conserve angular momentum, ω decreases.

Now, the initial rotation period of Earth is about 24 hours. Let's say it's T_initial = 24 hours. The new period T_final will be longer because the angular velocity is less. Angular velocity ω = 2π / T. So if ω_final is (2/5) ω_initial, then T_final = (ω_initial / ω_final ) * T_initial.

Wait, no. Let me think. ω_final = (2/5) ω_initial.

But ω = 2π / T, so ω_final = (2/5) * (2π / T_initial) ) = 2π / T_final.

So,

(2/5) * (2π / T_initial) ) = 2π / T_final.

Cancel 2π from both sides:

(2/5) / T_initial = 1 / T_final.

So, T_final = (5/2) T_initial.

So T_initial is 24 hours. So T_final is (5/2)*24 = 60 hours.

Wait, that's 60 hours. But wait, 60 hours is a day and a half. So the new period is longer. So the Earth would take longer to rotate.

So the first part of the question is, how long would it take? 60 hours, which is about 2.5 days. Looking at the options:

Option A: 60 hours, fraction lost is 2/3.

Wait, but let me think about the kinetic energy loss.

The initial kinetic energy (KE_initial) of Earth as a solid sphere would be (1/2) I_initial ω_initial².

The final KE is (1/2) I_final ω_final².

We can compute the fraction lost as (KE_initial - KE_final) / KE_initial.

But let's calculate:

KE_initial = 0.5 * (2/5 M R²) * ω_initial².

KE_final = 0.5 * (M R²) * ( (2/5 ω_initial) )².

So, KE_final = 0.5 * M R² * (4/25 ω_initial²) ) = (0.5 * M R² ω_initial²) * (4/25) = (4/25) KE_initial.

So, KE_initial - KE_final = KE_initial (1 - 4/25) = (21/25) KE_initial.

Thus, the fraction lost is 21/25, which is 0.84, so 84% of KE is lost. Wait, no, wait the question says "fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost." So, the fraction lost is (KE_final - KE_initial)/(KE_initial) ? No, wait, no. Wait, the change is KE_final - KE_initial, but that can't be right. Wait, no. No, because KE_final is less than KE_initial, so the change is negative. The fraction lost is (KE_initial - KE_final)/KE_initial. Because KE_initial is the initial, and KE_final is lower, the difference is the energy lost.

So, KE_initial is the initial KE, and KE_final is 4/25 of that. So, KE_initial - KE_final = (21/25) KE_initial. So the fraction lost is 21/25, which is 84% of the initial KE is lost.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options have 21/25. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options provided are:

A: 60 hours, 2/3 lost

B: 42 hours, 1/5 lost

C: 54 hours, 4/5 lost

D: 50 hours, 3/5 lost

E: 36 hours, 1/4 lost

F: 30 hours, 1/2 lost

G: 28 hours, 1/6 lost

H: 40 hours, 2/5 lost

I: 24 hours, 1/3 lost

J: 48 hours, 3/4 lost

Wait, none of these have 21/25, which is 0.84. So that suggests I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the fraction. Let me recheck.

Wait, the fraction lost is (KE_initial - KE_final)/ KE_initial.

KE_initial is (1/2) I_initial ω_initial².

KE_final is (1/2) I_final ω_final².

So, KE_initial = (1/2) * (2/5 M R²) * ω_initial².

KE_final = (1/2) * (M R²) * ( (2/5 ω_initial) )².

So, KE_final = (1/2) * (M R²) * (4/25 ω_initial²) = (4/50) M R² ω_initial².

Wait, (1/2) * (M R²) * (4/25) ω_initial² = (4/50) M R² ω_initial² = 2/25 M R² ω_initial².

Wait, no. Let's compute it properly.

(1/2) * (M R²) * (4/25) ω_initial squared.

So, (1/2) * (M R²) * (4/25) ω_initial² = (4/50) M R² ω_initial² = (2/25) M R² ω_initial².

Wait, but KE_initial is (1/2) * (2/5 M R²) * ω_initial² = (1/5) M R² ω_initial².

So, KE_initial = 0.2 M R² ω_initial².

KE_final = (2/25) M R² ω_initial² = 0.08 M R² ω_initial².

So, KE_initial - KE_final = 0.2 - 0.08 = 0.12 M R² ω_initial².

So, the fraction lost is 0.12 / 0.2 = 0.6, which is 60% of the initial kinetic energy is lost.

Wait, 0.12 / 0.2 = 0.6 → 60% loss.

Looking at the options, which option has 60% loss and 60 hours?

Wait, the options are:

A: 60 hours, 2/3 (≈66.67%) lost.

B:42, 1/5 (20% loss).

C:54, 4/5 (80% loss).

D:50, 3/5 (60% loss). Wait, 3/5 is 0.6, which is 60%.

Wait, so D says 50 hours, 3/5 lost.

But according to my calculation, the fraction lost is 0.6, which is 3/5. So the fraction lost is 3/5.

So the correct answer should be 50 hours and fraction 3/5 lost.

Looking at the options, option D is 50 hours, 3/5 lost.

Wait, but earlier I thought the period would be 60 hours. Now I'm confused.

Wait, let me recompute the period.

Earlier, I found that T_final = T_initial * (5/2) → 24 * (5/2) = 60 hours. So that's correct.

So, the Earth would take 60 hours to rotate.

Wait, but according to my KE calculation, the fraction lost is 3/5 (60% of KE is lost).

So the options must have D as the correct one. But wait, the options are:

Looking back, the initial KE and the fraction lost:

The options are:

A: 60 hours, 2/3 lost → 66.67% loss.

B:42, 0.2.

C:54, 0.8.

D:50, 0.6.

E:36, 0.25.

So, 60% loss corresponds to option D:50 hours, 3/5 lost.

Wait, but wait, I thought the fraction was 3/5, but I'm getting 0.6 which is 3/5. So option D.

Wait, but I thought the fraction lost was 60%. So 60% is 3/5, correct.

So the correct answer should be D:50 hours, 3/5 loss.

Wait, but another thought: when the shell is rotating, the moment of inertia increases, so the angular velocity decreases. So the KE after the change would be less. So the KE_initial is (1/2) I_initial ω_initial².

KE_final = (1/2) I_final ( (2/5 ω_initial) )².

So, (1/2) (M R²) (4/25 ω_initial²) = (4/50) M R² ω_initial².

I_initial was (2/5 M R²) → (1/2) I_initial ω_initial² = (1/2) (2/5) M R² ω_initial² = (1/5) M R² ω_initial².

So, KE_initial = (1/5) M R² ω_initial².

KE_final = (4/50) M R² ω_initial² = (2/25) M R² ω_initial².

So, KE_initial is (5/25)= 0.2 M R² ω_initial².

KE_final is (2/25) → 0.08.

So, the change is 0.12, which is 60% of initial KE.

Wait, so the fraction lost is 0.12 / 0.2 = 0.6 → 60% loss.

So, the process is correct.

So the correct answer is D:50 hours, 3/5 lost.

But wait, the options don't have 60% loss as option A. Option A says 2/3 (≈66.67%) is lost. So option D is the correct one.

To solve the problem, we analyze the scenario where the Earth, initially a uniform solid sphere, is suddenly moved to a thin-walled hollow spherical shell. The goal is to determine the new rotation period and the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial and Final Moments of Inertia**:
   - For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia is \( I_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \).
   - For a thin-walled spherical shell, the moment of inertia is \( I_{\text{final}} = M R^2 \).

2. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**:
   - Angular momentum is conserved since there are no external torques acting on the system.
   - \( I_{\text{initial}} \omega_{\text{initial}} = I_{\text{final}} \omega_{\text{final}} \).
   - Solving for \( \omega_{\text{final}} \):
     \[
     \omega_{\text{final}} = \frac{I_{\text{initial}}}{I_{\text{final}}} \omega_{\text{initial}} = \frac{\frac{2}{5} M R^2}{M R^2} \omega_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2}{5} \omega_{\text{initial}}.
     \]

3. **New Rotation Period**:
   - Angular velocity \( \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} \), so:
     \[
     T_{\text{final}} = \frac{\omega_{\text{final}}}{\omega_{\text{initial}}} T_{\text{initial}} = \frac{\frac{2}{5} \omega_{\text{initial}}}{\omega_{\text{initial}}} T_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2}{5} T_{\text{initial}}.
     \]
   - For Earth, \( T_{\text{initial}} = 24 \, \text{hours} \), so:
     \[
     T_{\text{final}} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 24 = 60 \, \text{hours}.
     \]

4. **Kinetic Energy Analysis**:
   - The initial kinetic energy of the Earth as a solid sphere is:
     \[
     KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} I_{\text{initial}} \omega_{\text{initial}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \omega_{\text{initial}}^2 = \frac{1}{5} M R^2 \omega_{\text{initial}}^2.
     \]
   - The final kinetic energy of the Earth as a thin-walled shell is:
     \[
     KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} I_{\text{final}} \omega_{\text{final}}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot M R^2 \left(\frac{2}{5} \omega_{\text{initial}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot M R^2 \cdot \frac{4}{25} \omega_{\text{initial}}^2 = \frac{2}{25} M R^2 \omega_{\text{initial}}^2.
     \]
   - The fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost is:
     \[
     \text{Fraction lost} = \frac{KE_{\text{initial}} - KE_{\text{final}}}{KE_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{5} M R^2 \omega_{\text{initial}}^2 - \frac{2}{25} M R^2 \omega_{\text{initial}}^2}{\frac{1}{5} M R^2 \omega_{\text{initial}}^2}.
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Fraction lost} = \frac{\frac{5}{25} - \frac{2}{25}}{\frac{5}{25}} = \frac{\frac{3}{25}}{\frac{5}{25}} = \frac{3}{5}.
     \]

### Final Results:
- The new rotation period is \( 60 \, \text{hours} \).
- The fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost is \( \frac{3}{5} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: 50 hours, 3/5 lost
