Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer between two materials. Let me think through it step by step. 

The setup is that there's brass and steel sheets, each 1 cm thick. The outer surface of the brass is at 100°C, and the steel's outer surface is at 0°C. I need to find the temperature at the interface where they meet.

Hmm, I remember something about thermal conduction and the concept of temperature gradients. Oh right, when two materials are in contact, heat flows from the hotter to the cooler. The rate of heat transfer depends on the thermal conductivity of the materials, their thickness, and the temperature difference.

Wait, thermal conductivity (k) is involved here. The ratio of the thermal conductivities is given as 2:1 between brass and steel. So, let me write that down. Let's say the thermal conductivity of brass is k and steel is k/2. Because the ratio is 2:1, so brass is twice as good at conducting heat as steel.

The formula for steady-state heat transfer between two materials is probably Q/t = (k * A * ΔT)/d. But wait, since both materials have the same thickness, maybe I can set up an equation comparing the heat flows through each material.

Wait, another approach: because both materials are at the same thickness, the temperature drop across each would be the same if they're in thermal equilibrium. But wait, the materials have different thermal conductivities, so the temperature drop might vary. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another idea: the heat current (Q/t) through each material should be the same because it's a steady state. So the heat flowing through brass equals the heat through steel.

So, the formula for heat current through a material is (k * A * ΔT) / d. For each material, the temperature difference across their thickness would be the same if the heat currents are equal.

Let me denote the interface temperature as T. Then, the temperature drop across brass would be 100°C - T. The drop across steel would be T - 0°C, which is T.

Since the materials have different conductivities, the temperature drops across them must be inversely proportional to their conductivities. Because (k_brass * (100-T)) / d_brass = (k_steel * T) / d_steel.

Wait, but wait, the materials have the same thickness (1 cm each), so d for both is 1 cm. So the equation becomes (k_brass * (100-T)) = (k_steel * T).

But the thermal conductivities are in a 2:1 ratio. Let me define k_steel as k, so k_brass is 2k. So substituting:

2k * (100 - T) = k * T.

Oh, that simplifies. Let's divide both sides by k to cancel it out. So:

2*(100-T) = T.

Multiply out:

200 - 2T = T.

Add 2T to both sides:

200 = 3T.

Divide both sides by 3:

T = 200/3 ≈ 66.666... °C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 66.7°C. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I did the setup correctly.

Wait, another point: the formula I used is correct because the heat current is the same through both materials. Since thermal conductivity is higher, the same temperature difference across a given thickness would result in more heat flow. So in brass, the drop is larger, which would mean a lower T.

Wait, let me recheck the equation. The heat current for brass is k_brass * (100 - T) / d. For steel, it's k_steel * T / d. Since d is the same, and both have the same d, we can ignore them in the ratio.

So the ratio of heat currents would be (k_brass (100-T)) : (k_steel T) = 2k * (100-T) : k*T. Since the heat currents are equal, the ratio is 1:1. So 2*(100-T) = T. Yep, same as before, leading to T ≈66.666°C.

Looking at the options, D is 66.7°C. So that's the answer.

To determine the temperature at the common interface between the brass and steel sheets, we analyze the heat transfer. The brass sheet has a thermal conductivity of \(2k\), and the steel sheet has a thermal conductivity of \(k\). The materials have the same thickness (\(1 \, \text{cm}\)) and are in contact with surfaces at \(100^\circ \text{C}\) and \(0^\circ \text{C}\), respectively.

In steady-state heat transfer, the heat current (\(Q/t\)) through both materials is equal. Using the formula for heat current:

\[
\frac{Q}{t} = \frac{k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T}{d}
\]

Since the thickness (\(d\)) and the area (\(A\)) are the same for both materials, the temperature drop across each material is proportional to their thermal conductivities. Let the interface temperature be \(T\). The temperature drop across brass is \(100 - T\), and across steel is \(T - 0 = T\). The ratio of the heat currents is:

\[
\frac{k_{\text{brass}} \cdot (100 - T)}{k_{\text{steel}} \cdot T} = 1
\]

Given \(k_{\text{brass}} = 2k\) and \(k_{\text{steel}} = k\), substituting these values:

\[
\frac{2k \cdot (100 - T)}{k \cdot T} = 1
\]

Simplify by canceling \(k\):

\[
2(100 - T) = T
\]

Expanding and solving for \(T\):

\[
200 - 2T = T \implies 200 = 3T \implies T = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67^\circ \text{C}
\]

Thus, the temperature at the common interface is approximately \(66.7^\circ \text{C}\), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
