Question:

A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician 3 months after she had a blood pressure of 150/95 mm Hg at a routine examination prior to participation in school sports. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Measurement of serum potassium levels
B: Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations
C: Exercise and weight reduction program
D: Captopril therapy
E: Initiate diuretic therapy
F: Referral for psychiatric evaluation
G: Initiate calcium channel blocker therapy
H: Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations
I: Measurement of plasma renin activity
J: Initiate beta-blocker therapy

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the next step for this 15-year-old girl based on her blood pressure and other test results. Let me go through this step by step.

First, her blood pressure was 150/95 mmHg when she was examined before school sports. Then she had a UTI and was given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Now she's 12 months later, and she's asymptomatic with no serious illness.

She's been measured three times—155/94, 145/90, and 150/92. The current reading is 150/90 mmHg, which is within the normal range. She's at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight, so her weight seems normal. Her hematocrit is 40%, which is within normal limits, I believe.

Her pulse is 80/min, which is within normal range, and respirations 12/min—also normal. Her ultrasounds are normal, and the blood pressure isn't showing any issues. So, heart and kidney function seem fine.

Looking at her blood pressure, it's been going up a bit. Let me break it down:

First reading: 155/94 → went up to 150/92. That's an increase of 5/1 in diastole, which is a bit concerning. The second reading was 145/90, then 150 again. The third reading is 150/90, which is within normal limits.

But wait, I thought her blood pressure was 150/95 initially and then went up. Let me see the progression: 150/95 (pre-sport), then 155/94, then 145/90, then 150/92, and current is 150/90. So the BP went up a bit, then went down a bit, then back up a bit. So perhaps there was a dip? Or maybe she's had some stress or other factors.

Her current BP is 150/90, which is within the normal range, so no immediate concern for hypertension. But the past readings went up a bit. So, the question is, why did she go up from 150/95 to 155/94 and then to 145/90?

Hmm. So, the initial BP was 150/95, and she had a UTI. Maybe she had a bad reaction to the antibiotics or the overall health? Or perhaps her exercise level changed. Or maybe she's had a fever or something that pushed her BP up.

Alternatively, maybe it's a result of other factors, but it's within normal so perhaps not a cause of concern. But she has a history of a UTI, which suggests she's at high risk for infections, but her current BP is normal.

Looking at the tests: her blood pressure is within normal, her blood pressure readings are normal, her other tests are within normal. So no elevated levels of potassium or other anions, no kidney issues, no electrolyte imbalances, no catecholamines, no renin activity.

So the options given are:

A: Measure serum potassium. But she's within normal, so this isn't the first step.

B: Urine corticosteroid. I don't think she's on any. The person isn't taking any medications, but if she had an infection and was on a corticosteroid, that's when they'd test. Otherwise, no need for that.

C: Exercise and weight reduction. I don't think so. She's not in a high-risk group for obesity, and since she's at the 50th percentile, it's probably not a concern. Plus, her current weight is within normal, so maybe not a problem.

D: Captopril therapy. That's a beta-blocker, which is for high blood pressure. She's not BP high, so this might not be needed.

E: Initiate diuretic therapy. Diuretics relieve high blood pressure by increasing urine output. But she's not high BP, so she's probably not on diuretics. Unless she's on her own, but her BP is normal. So, no.

F: Referral for psychiatric evaluation. She's asymptomatic, so this doesn't make sense. No need for that.

G: Initiate calcium channel blocker therapy. Those are for high blood pressure, again not needed here.

H: Measure catecholamine. She's within normal, so not necessary.

I: Measure plasma renin activity. She's not high BP, so no need.

J: Initiate beta-blocker. Since she's not high BP, J is not needed.

So the only options that make sense are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. But all of these seem unnecessary for her current condition. Her BP is within normal, and her other tests are fine.

Wait, but perhaps she has a history of a UTI which could have caused her BP to go up again. But her current BP is within normal, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe this is a post-sport reaction. Alternatively, perhaps she's had a temporary change in her blood pressure, but it's within normal.

So the next steps could be to check her potassium, perhaps. Because if she has a high potassium, that could be a concern. But in her case, it's normal.

Alternatively, perhaps she's on some medication that's causing her to have a higher BP, but she's not. Or maybe she's had a temporary spike before, but current is normal.

Wait, but the question is asking for the most appropriate next step. Since her BP is within normal, and other tests are fine, perhaps she needs to check for other conditions like kidney stones, but since the renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, that's ruled out.

Wait, but her blood pressure is within normal, so she's probably not high risk for hypertension. So the management options are probably about managing heart or kidney function, but her current readings don't suggest any issues. So perhaps she's just fine.

But sometimes, even with normal BP, if there's a history of high BP, a beta-blocker might be indicated, but in this case, she's not on one.

Alternatively, perhaps she's at a high risk for hypertension, but her BP is within normal. Maybe she has a history of hypertension or is on a medication that raises it, but she's not.

Wait, the initial BP was 150/95, which is considered normal. Then it went up to 155/94, then to 145/90, then 150 again, and current is 150/90. So the BP went up and then came down again. So it's fluctuating within normal.

But that doesn't necessarily mean anything. So the tests are all within normal, so no need to change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps she has a medical condition that's causing this. For example, maybe she's on some medication that affects her BP, but since she's not taking any, maybe it's not that.

But in the options given, the only steps that make sense are to check potassium, but she's already within normal.

Wait, but why would her BP go up and then down? Maybe it's a temporary fluctuation. Or perhaps she's on some medication that affects her BP, but she isn't taking any. So perhaps she's just fine.

In that case, the next steps would be to monitor her for any changes that could indicate a problem, but since it's within normal, perhaps it's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps she's on some medication that's causing this, but the question says she's asymptomatic and hasn't taken any medications. So that's not applicable.

Wait, but another possibility is that she's on an antibiotic that caused the BP to go up, but I don't think so. Or perhaps she's had a fever or another condition.

But given all this, I think the most appropriate next step is to measure her potassium. Because if she has high potassium, that could indicate hypokalemia, which might be a cause for concern. But in her case, it's normal.

Alternatively, maybe her BP is fine, but another condition is present. However, the tests are all normal, so I think the answer is to perform the serum potassium test.

Looking at the options, option A is measurement of serum potassium. So I think the answer is A.

The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a blood pressure (BP) of 150/95 mmHg at routine examination and asymptomatic. She was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) 12 months prior and was treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Subsequent blood pressure measurements have been: 155/94 mmHg, 145/90 mmHg, and 150/92 mmHg, with a current reading of 150/90 mmHg. Her other test results (ultrasonography, kidney function, electrolytes) are normal, and her hematocrit is 40%. The exam shows no other abnormalities.

The patient's BP is within normal limits, and her other tests are not indicating any pathologies. Therefore, the next steps should focus on normalizing her BP, kidney function, or other related tests. However, the options provided include various tests, but all are unnecessary for her current condition. Among the options, the most appropriate next step is to measure serum potassium, as it can help rule out hypokalemia, a potential concern for her BP or other conditions, even though her current BP is within normal limits.
