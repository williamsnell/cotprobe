Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this argument is valid. The argument given is:

1. ~X ⊃ Y
2. Y ⊃ Z
3. ~Z
Conclusion: ~X

Wait, so I have to construct a truth table for all possible truth values of X, Y, and Z, and then see if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If there's a situation where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid.

Let me write down each premise and the conclusion:

1. ~X implies Y. Which is the same as saying if X is true, then Y must be false. Alternatively, if Y is true, X must be false. Because in logic, "A implies B" is equivalent to "not A or B".

2. Y implies Z. So if Y is true, Z must be true. If Y is false, Z can be anything.

3. ~Z, which means Z is false.

The conclusion is ~X, meaning X is false.

So, the premises are:

- If X is true, then Y is false (from premise 1).
- If Y is true, then Z is true (premise 2).
- Z is false (premise 3).

So let's try to see if these can all be true at the same time. If they can't, then the argument is invalid.

Let me try to see if these premises can be true together.

From premise 3, Z is false.

Looking at premise 2: Y implies Z. Since Z is false, for Y implies Z to be true, Y must be false. Because in implication, if the antecedent is true, the consequent must be true. If the consequent is false, the implication is automatically false. So Y must be false for premise 2 to hold if Z is false.

Now, if Y is false, what about premise 1? Premise 1 is ~X implies Y. So if Y is false, ~X implies false. An implication is true unless the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So if Y is false, the implication ~X → Y is automatically true regardless of X. So in this case, premise 1 is satisfied whether X is true or false.

So, the only constraints so far are:

Z is false.

Y is false.

But, what about X? The premises don't impose any restrictions on X except through premise 1. So X can be either true or false.

Wait, but from premise 1, if X is true, then Y must be false. But we already have Y is false. So what's the issue?

Wait, perhaps I should construct the truth table for all possible X, Y, Z.

Let's make a table with all possibilities:

X | Y | Z | ~X | ~X ⊃ Y | Y ⊃ Z | ~Z | Conclusion (~X)
---|---|---|----|---------|--------|----|----------
T | T | T | F | F → T= T  | T → T=T | F | F
Wait, not sure if that's the best way. Let me think differently.

Wait, let me list the possible combinations for X, Y, Z.

But perhaps a better approach is to see if there's any scenario where all premises are true, but the conclusion ~X is false. The conclusion ~X is false only when X is true.

So, if in some scenario, premises are true, but X is true, then the conclusion is false, which would mean the argument is invalid.

So, let's look for a scenario where:

~X ⊃ Y is true.

Y ⊃ Z is true.

~Z is true (so Z is false).

And X is true.

If such a scenario exists, then the argument is invalid.

So, let's see.

If Z is false (from premise 3), then Y ⊃ Z is Y → false.

For Y → false to be true, Y must be false. Because Y → F is only true when Y is F.

So Y must be false.

Now, with Y false, looking at premise 1: ~X ⊃ Y.

Which is same as X → Y. Because ~X implies Y is equivalent to X → Y.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think:

~X ⊃ Y is the same as X ∨ Y.

Because in implication, a → b is equivalent to ~a ∨ b.

So, ~X ⊃ Y is X ∨ Y.

So, if X ∨ Y must be true.

But since Y is false, X ∨ Y is X.

So X must be true.

So, to satisfy all premises:

Z is false (from premise 3),

Y is false (because Y → Z is premise 2, which is Y → F, so Y must be F),

X must be true (because X ∨ Y is X, which must be true for premise 1 to hold).

So, in this scenario, X is true, Y is false, Z is false.

So, in this case, the premises are:

~X: X is T → ~X is F.

Y is F.

So, ~X → Y: F → F is T.

Y → Z: F → F is T.

And ~Z: Z is F, so ~Z is T.

All premises are true.

The conclusion is ~X: X is T, so conclusion is F.

So, in this scenario, all premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Therefore, the argument is invalid.

Now, what is the counterexample? When X is true, Y is false, Z is false. So the counterexample is when X is true, Y is false, Z is false.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option G says: Invalid. Counterexample when Y is true and X and Z are false.

Wait, no, the counterexample I found is X=T, Y=F, Z=F.

Let me check the options given.

Options:

A: Valid. All combinations are true.

B: Valid. No counterexamples exist.

C: Valid.

D: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because in my case, Z is false.

Wait, looking at the options, for each option, they give conditions under which the argument is invalid. So the correct option would be the one where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

So the counterexample is X=T, Y=F, Z=F.

Looking at the options:

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when Y is true and X and Z are false.

No, that's not matching.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false. That's not right because in our counterexample, Z is false.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the counterexample I found is when X is true, Y is false, Z is false.

Looking at the options, which one matches that?

Looking at the options:

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when Y is true and X and Z are false.

No, that doesn't fit.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false.

Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me look again.

Option D says: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false.

Wait, that's incorrect because in our case, Z is false.

Wait, maybe I misread the option. Let me read it again.

Looking at the options:

D: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false.

Wait, that's not possible because if Z is true, and Z is false at the same time, it's impossible. So perhaps D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the counterexample.

Wait, let me think again.

The premises are:

1. ~X → Y → same as X ∨ Y.

2. Y → Z.

3. ~Z.

And conclusion: ~X.

We need a scenario where premises are true, conclusion is false.

So, premises true:

1. X ∨ Y.

2. Y → Z → Since Z is false, Y must be false. So Y is F.

3. Z is F.

Now, from premise 1: X ∨ Y → X ∨ F → X must be true.

So X is T.

So, X is T, Y is F, Z is F.

Which is our counterexample.

So, when X=T, Y=F, Z=F.

Looking at the options, which one matches this.

Options:

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when Y is true and X and Z are false.

No, because in our case, Y is F, not Y is T.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false.

Wait, that's the same as Y is true and Z is false. But in our counterexample, Y is false.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options.

Looking again:

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when Y is true and X and Z are false.

No, that's not matching.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false.

Wait, but in our case, Z is false, Y is false. So the condition in D is Y and Z are true and Z is false. Which can't happen, so D is incorrect.

Option F: Invalid. Counterexample when X is false and Y and Z are true.

In our case, X is T, so F is wrong.

Option E: Invalid. Counterexample when X, Y, and Z are false.

But in our case, X is T, so E is wrong.

Option B: Valid. No counterexamples exist. No, because we found a counterexample.

Option A: Valid. All combinations, but we have a counterexample.

Wait, but the options present conditions when the argument is invalid. So the correct option is the one that correctly identifies the counterexample.

So the counterexample is when X is true, Y is false, Z is false.

Looking at the options, which one says that.

Wait, looking again:

Option G says: Invalid. Counterexample when Y is true and X and Z are false.

No, not matching.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false.

No, because in our case Y is false.

Option F: Invalid. Counterexample when X is false and Y and Z are true.

No, because X is true.

Option H: Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false.

Wait, option H says when X is true, Y and Z are false. Which is exactly our counterexample.

Wait, option H is:

H: Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false.

Yes, that matches our scenario.

So the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The argument is invalid because there exists a counterexample where X is true, Y is false, and Z is false. This scenario satisfies all the premises but results in the conclusion being false. 

Answer: H: Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false.
