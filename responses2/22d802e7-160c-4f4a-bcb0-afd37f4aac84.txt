Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which culture lived a primarily sedentary lifestyle in the Southwest. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that a sedentary lifestyle means they don't move a lot, probably living in groups. So, I'm looking for a culture that's known for its social groupings and not much walking or moving around. 

Let me go through each option:

A: Mogollon. I think the Mogollon are from the Americas, maybe North America. Bob Marley was from there, but I'm not sure about their lifestyle. They might have had sedentary groups, but I'm not certain.

B: Navajo. I've heard the Navajo term "sod" which is about being in groups and not moving much. So this sounds like a candidate. They lived in herds, right? They were known for their strong social structure and didn't move around much.

C: Clovis. Clovis is from the Iroquois tribe, I think. They were known for their group living, like herds, right? But I'm not sure if they were sedentary or if they moved a lot. Maybe they did, but I thought they had some mobility.

D: Paleo-Indians. Paleo implies ancient, and the Paleo-Indians were ancestors of many modern groups, including the Incas and the Incas were pretty mobile. So this doesn't fit sedentary.

E: Hopewell. I believe Hopewell was a group living in herds, not moving much. They were known for their strong social structure and herds. So this fits the sedentary lifestyle.

F: Inca. The Incas moved a lot, especially in their cities, so Inca culture wasn't sedentary. They were more mobile and settled in cities.

G: Adena. Maybe from the Aztecs? The Aztecs were very mobile and moved a lot, so Adena would not fit.

H: Kwakiutl. I'm not sure about this one. They were part of the Inuit people, right? I think they had herds and were not moving much. So this could be another candidate.

J: Apache. The Apache were known as the "Great Ones." I think they lived in herds and didn't move much. They were strong and social.

So, the options that fit are B, E, H, J, and maybe another. Let me double-check.

Navajo (B) is definitely known for herds and not much mobility. Hopewell (E) fits too, as they were herds living in groups. Kwakiutl (H) are part of the Inuit and were herds, so they fit. Apache (J) are also herds and not moving much. 

Wait, the question asks for primarily sedentary, so any of these could be correct. But I'm trying to see which is the most accurate.

In the Southwest, which areas are these from? The Southwest is the part that includes the Sonoran Desert and the Great Plains. The Navajo are from the Great Plains area, Hopewell from Inuit regions, and Apache from the Great Plains as well. The Incas were in the Andes, so they wouldn't be in the Southwest. 

So the options in the Southwest would be B (Navajo), H (Kwakiutl), and J (Apache). But the question is asking for the culture, so all these could be correct. Wait, the options are A to J, and I have to choose one.

Looking back, the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to pick the most accurate one.

Wait, the question is about the Southwest. The Hopewell culture is part of the Inuit group, and they lived in herds. Apache is also part of the Inuit but more of a herding culture. But I'm a bit confused about whether they were herding or more mobile. Maybe they moved a lot but still were in groups. 

Navajo (B) is definitely in the Southwest. The Hopewell (H) and Apache (J) are also in the Southwest. So why are they presenting all as options? The question is asking which culture, so perhaps there's more than one correct answer, but since it's a multiple-choice and the options are separate, maybe the intended answer is one of them.

Wait, the question might have only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to think about the correct historical facts. The Navajo, Hopewell, and Apache are all part of the Inuit culture, which was a strong, herding group. So all three could be correct in terms of being sedentary.

But the options are A to J, each a different culture. So perhaps the question is looking for the primary answer, and in the Southwest, the correct answer is Hopewell. Or the Apache. Alternatively, the question might have only one correct answer. 

Wait, I think the correct answer is Hopewell. Because I remember that the Hopewell were known for their herds and strong social structure, but I'm not certain about the exact time period. Apache was also in the Southwest. Hmm.

Alternatively, I might be conflating different periods. Let me think. The Hopewell are part of the Inuit, who were among the first to establish their way across North America. They were known for their strong social groups and herding. The Apache were another Inuit group living in herds, perhaps in the Great Plains.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recall that the Hopewell were part of the Inuit who were settled in the areas of the Great Plains, which includes the Southwest (like the Sonoran Desert and Great Plains regions). Similarly, the Apache were also in the Southwest.

So, the question is which of these is the primary sedentary culture in the Southwest. So all of these (B, H, J) could be correct.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice, so only one option is correct. Maybe I should look up the exact answer, but since I can't, I need to rely on my memory.

Another angle: the question lists the options as A through J. The correct answer is likely Hopewell. Because the Hopewell were known for their herding and strong social groups, which aligns with the sedentary lifestyle. Apache is another correct answer. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about which culture. If I have to choose between Hopewell and Apache, perhaps the Hopewell are the primary answer. Alternatively, all three (B, H, J) are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple selections. So perhaps the intended answer is Hopewell.

Alternatively, the correct answer is Hopewell. Because the Hopewell were the primary Inuit group known for their herding, which is a sedentary lifestyle.

The question asks which sedentary culture lived primarily in the Southwest. A sedentary lifestyle implies social grouping and mobility of minimal activity. The Southwest includes regions like the Sonoran Desert and Great Plains. Among the options:

- **B: Navajo** - Known for herding and strong social groups, fitting a sedentary lifestyle.
- **H: Kwakiutl** - Part of the Inuit group, known for herding and strong social structures.
- **J: Apache** - Another Inuit culture with herding practices in the Southwest.

The Hopewell and Apache are also Inuit groups with herding traditions. However, the Hopewell are often highlighted for their strong social structures and herding. The Apache, while a strong answer, might be a more recent or localized example. Given the options, the Hopewell (H) are a primary correct answer.

Answer: H
