Alright, I've got this differential equation problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, the problem is to solve the initial value problem 4y'' - y = 0 with the conditions y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = β. Then, I need to find the value of β such that the solution approaches zero as t approaches infinity.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, especially second-order ones like this, we usually start by finding the characteristic equation. The standard approach is to assume a solution of the form y = e^(rt), plug it into the equation, and solve for r. 

So, let's write down the equation again: 4y'' - y = 0. Let me rewrite it in standard form. Dividing both sides by 4, we get y'' - (1/4)y = 0. So, the characteristic equation would be r² - (1/4) = 0.

Solving that, r² = 1/4 → r = ±1/2. So, the roots are real and distinct, which means the general solution will be a combination of e^( (1/2)t ) and e^(-(1/2)t ). That would be y(t) = C1 e^( (1/2)t ) + C2 e^(-(1/2)t ).

Now, applying the initial conditions. First, y(0) = 2. Plugging t=0 into the general solution: y(0) = C1 e^(0) + C2 e^(0) → 2 = C1 + C2. So, equation one is C1 + C2 = 2.

Next, the derivative of y(t) is y'(t) = (1/2) C1 e^( (1/2)t ) - (1/2) C2 e^(-(1/2)t ). Applying y'(0) = β, we have β = (1/2)C1 - (1/2)C2.

So, equation two is (1/2)(C1 - C2) = β. Let me write that as C1 - C2 = 2β.

Now, I have a system of two equations:
1. C1 + C2 = 2
2. C1 - C2 = 2β

Let me solve for C1 and C2. If I add the two equations: (C1 + C2) + (C1 - C2) = 2 + 2β → 2C1 = 2(1 + β) → C1 = 1 + β.

Substituting back into equation 1: (1 + β) + C2 = 2 → C2 = 2 - (1 + β) = 1 - β.

So now, the solution is y(t) = (1 + β) e^( (1/2)t ) + (1 - β) e^(-(1/2)t ).

The problem asks for β such that y(t) approaches zero as t approaches infinity. Let's analyze the behavior of y(t) as t→infty.

Looking at the terms: e^( (1/2)t ) grows exponentially as t increases, and e^(-(1/2)t ) decays exponentially. So, the first term will dominate unless the coefficient (1 + β) is zero. Because if (1 + β) is zero, the first term becomes zero, and the second term becomes (1 - β) e^(-(1/2)t ), which still decays if (1 - β) isn't zero. Wait, but no, if (1 + β) is zero, then the first term is zero, leaving only the second term. So, the solution would be y(t) = (1 - β) e^(-(1/2)t ), which tends to zero as t→infty. But for this to happen, (1 + β) must be zero, so β = -1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If (1 + β) isn't zero, then as t→infty, the term (1 + β) e^( (1/2)t ) will dominate, so unless (1 + β) is zero, the solution doesn't go to zero. So, to have y(t) approach zero, we must have (1 + β) = 0. That gives β = -1.

Alternatively, I can think about the stability of the system. The characteristic equation has roots at ±1/2. The general solution is a combination of e^( (1/2)t ) and e^(-(1/2)t ). For the solution to decay to zero, the coefficients on these exponentials must be zero. So, the coefficient on e^( (1/2)t ) must be zero, which is (1 + β) = 0 → β = -1.

So, the correct β is -1. Looking at the options, option J is -1. Therefore, the answer is J: -1.

To solve the initial value problem \(4y'' - y = 0\) with \(y(0) = 2\) and \(y'(0) = \beta\), we first find the characteristic equation:

\[
r^2 - \frac{1}{4} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \pm \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The general solution is:

\[
y(t) = C_1 e^{(1/2)t} + C_2 e^{-(1/2)t}.
\]

Applying the initial conditions:
1. \(y(0) = C_1 + C_2 = 2\).
2. \(y'(0) = \frac{1}{2}C_1 - \frac{1}{2}C_2 = \beta\).

Solving the system:
- From the first equation: \(C_1 = 2 - C_2\).
- Substituting into the second: \(\frac{1}{2}(2 - C_2) - \frac{1}{2}C_2 = \beta\) → \(1 - C_2 = \beta\) → \(C_2 = 1 - \beta\).

Substituting back, \(C_1 = 1 + \beta\). Thus, the solution is:

\[
y(t) = (1 + \beta) e^{(1/2)t} + (1 - \beta) e^{-(1/2)t}.
\]

For \(y(t) \to 0\) as \(t \to \infty\), the coefficient of the growing term must be zero:

\[
1 + \beta = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \beta = -1.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **J: -1**.
