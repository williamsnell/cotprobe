Okay, so I have this question about radiant intensity of a Lambertian emitter. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the question says: What is the radiant intensity of a Lambertian emitter that projects 50mW into a hemisphere. The options are A to J, each with different values in W/sr.

Wait, what's a Lambertian emitter? I remember that Lambertian means it emits light uniformly in all directions, but only in a certain hemisphere. Wait, no—wait, no. Wait, no, wait. A Lambertian surface reflects light according to the law of reciprocal reflection, so the intensity depends on the cosine of the angle. So, a Lambertian emitter emits light isotropically in a way that the intensity decreases with the angle.

But wait, the question is about radiant intensity. Oh, right. Radiant intensity is like the power emitted by a light source in a particular direction, measured in watts per steradian (W/sr). And for a Lambertian emitter, the intensity is highest in the direction of the light source and decreases with the cosine of the angle from that direction.

I think the formula for the radiant intensity from a Lambertian source is I = I_0 * cos(theta), where I_0 is the intensity at the source and theta is the angle from the direction of emission. Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, wait. I remember that for a point source, the intensity decreases with the square of the distance, but here it's about the emission pattern.

Wait, no, perhaps for a Lambertian emitter, the intensity is I = I_0 * (1 + cos(theta)), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, I think for a Lambertian emitter, the intensity at a distance r is I = I_0 / (4π r²), but that's for a point source. Wait, no, perhaps that's the intensity from a point source, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The question says the emitter projects 50 mW into a hemisphere. Wait, wait—does that mean the total power emitted in a hemisphere is 50 mW? Or is it that the total power in a hemisphere is 50 mW? Hmm, I think it's the latter. Because a hemisphere is half a sphere, 2π steradians (since a hemisphere is half of 4π). So, if the emitter emits 50 mW into a hemisphere, then the radiant intensity in the hemisphere would be 50 mW/(1 hemisphere steradian).

Wait, but the question asks for the radiant intensity of the emitter. Wait, what's the definition. Oh, right, radiant intensity is the power emitted in a particular direction, so it's like the intensity emitted in that direction. So, if the emitter is Lambertian, the intensity I is given by I = I_0 * cos(theta). But I'm not sure what the source is. Oh wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the entire power is emitted into the hemisphere. So, the total power is 50 mW, and the total solid angle is 2π steradians. So, the radiant intensity would be the power per steradian in that hemisphere. So, I think the formula is I = P / (solid angle). Oh wait, that's right. Because if the total power is 50 mW, and that's spread over 2π steradians (since a hemisphere is 2π steradians), then each steradian in the hemisphere would have 50/(2π) mW/sr. Wait, but wait, the question is about the radiant intensity, which is the power per steradian in a specific direction. So, for a Lambertian emitter, the intensity at a direction depends on the angle.

Wait, no. Wait, the total power emitted into a hemisphere is 50 mW. So, the radiant intensity (which is power per steradian) would be 50 mW divided by the solid angle of the hemisphere. The solid angle of a hemisphere is 2π steradians. So 50 mW / (2π sr) = 50/(6.2832) ≈ 7.9577 mW/sr.

Wait, but looking at the options, the values are all in W/sr. Let me convert 50 mW to W: that's 0.05 W. So 0.05 W / (2π sr) ≈ 0.05 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.0079577 W/sr. Looking at the options, option I is .00895, which is near that. But wait, the options list I: .00895 (W/sr). Hmm, but wait, the question says the luminance is 50 mW into a hemisphere. Oh no, wait, wait, no, the question says 'projects 50mW into a hemisphere'. So, the total power in the hemisphere is 50 mW. So, the total power is 50 mW (or 0.05 W), and the hemisphere is 2π sr.

So, the radiant intensity would be 0.05/(2π) ≈ 0.0079577 W/sr. Looking at the options, option I is .00895, which is higher than that. So that doesn't match. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the problem is a bit different. Maybe the question is about the mean radiant intensity or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 50 mW is the total power emitted, but the emission is Lambertian, so the intensity depends on the angle.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got it wrong. The question says: the emitor projects 50mW into a hemisphere. So, the total power in the hemisphere is 50 mW. So, the radiant intensity in the hemisphere is 50 mW per steradian. So, the radiant intensity would be 50 mW/(2π sr) = 50/(6.2832) ≈ 7.9577 mW/sr, which is 0.0079577 W/sr. Looking at the options, option I is 0.00895, which is a little higher. But none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the 50 mW is the power emitted into the hemisphere, which would be the total power. So, the radiant intensity is the power per steradian. So, 50 mW is 0.05 W. Divided by 2π steradians, which is about 6.28319. So 0.05 / 6.28319 ≈ 0.0079577 W/sr. Looking at the options, option I is .00895 (W/sr), which is close but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the average radiant intensity over the hemisphere, but I don't think that's the case. Or perhaps it's about the average intensity over the sphere, but since it's Lambertian, the average would be different.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The problem states that the Lambertian emitter projects 50 mW into a hemisphere. So, that 50 mW is the total power in that hemisphere. So, the radiant intensity (which is power per steradian in a direction) is 50 mW divided by the solid angle of the hemisphere (which is 2π steradians). So 50e-3 W / (2π) ≈ 50e-3 / 6.283 ≈ 0.0079577 W/sr. So that's approximately 0.00796 W/sr. Looking at the options:

A: 0.00995

B: 0.01095

C: 0.01295

D: 0.00695

E: 0.00295

F: 0.00495

G: 0.00595

H: 0.00795

I: 0.00895

J: 0.00395

So, option H is 0.00795, which is very close to what I calculated. So, perhaps the correct answer is H: .00795 (W/sr).

Wait, but the problem could be that the 50 mW is the power emitted in a hemisphere, but the question is about the radiant intensity, which is the power per solid angle in a specific direction. For a Lambertian emitter, the intensity depends on the angle. But in this case, perhaps the question is referring to the average intensity over the hemisphere. Wait, no, the question says 'projects 50mW into a hemisphere' which I think implies that the total power emitted in that hemisphere is 50 mW. But the question is about the radiant intensity, which is the power per direction, not the total.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem says, "What is the radiant intensity of aLambertianemitter which projects 50mWinto a hemisphere." So, the emitter emits 50 mW into a hemisphere. The hemisphere is 2π steradians. So, the radiant intensity per steradian in the hemisphere is 50 mW / (2π sr) ≈ 7.9577 mW/sr, which is 0.0079577 W/sr. So, looking at the options, option H is 0.00795, which is the closest.

Wait, but the options have H as .00795, which matches closely. So, the correct answer should be option H. But why is there an option I with 0.00895? Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the average radiant intensity over the sphere, which for a Lambertian emitter would be different.

Wait, the average radiant intensity over a sphere for a Lambertian emitter is (I_0) * (1/2), because the intensity varies as cos(theta), and integrating over all directions gives an average of I_0/2.

Wait, but in this case, the problem isn't giving us the total power, but the total power in a hemisphere. So, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the hemisphere, but about the emission from a point source. Wait, no, the question clearly states that it 'projects 50mW into a hemisphere.' So, the total power in that hemisphere is 50 mW. So, the radiant intensity is 50 mW / (2π sr) = 0.0079577 W/sr.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.00795, which is very close. So, the answer is H. But wait, the options list I as 0.00895, which is 0.00895, which is higher than 0.00795. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total power emitted by the source, not into a hemisphere. Oh, but the question says 'projects 50mW into a hemisphere.' So, the 50mW is the power emitted into that hemisphere.

Hmm, another angle: perhaps the problem is about the average radiant intensity in the hemisphere. Oh no, the problem says, "the radiant intensity of aLambertianemitter which projects 50mWinto a hemisphere." So, the 50mW is the total power in the hemisphere. So, for each direction in the hemisphere, the power is I * dΩ, where I is the radiant intensity.

So, the total power in the hemisphere is the integral of I(θ) * dΩ from θ=0 to θ=π.

But for a Lambertian emitter, the intensity is I_0 * cos(theta), where I_0 is the intensity at the source.

Wait, but if the source is at the center of the hemisphere, then for any point in the hemisphere, the intensity is I_0 * cos(theta). The total power emitted into the hemisphere would be the integral of I(θ) * dΩ.

So, I_0 ∫ cos(theta) * dΩ from theta=0 to pi.

The integral of cos(theta) over a sphere is known. Let me compute it.

In spherical coordinates, dΩ = sin(theta) dtheta dphi.

So, the integral becomes I_0 ∫ [cos(theta) * sin(theta) ] dtheta from 0 to pi, multiplied by the integral over phi from 0 to 2pi.

So, the integral over phi is 2pi. The integral over theta is ∫ cos(theta) sin(theta) dtheta from 0 to pi.

Let me compute that. Let u = sin(theta), then du = cos(theta) dtheta.

So, ∫ cos(theta) sin(theta) dtheta = ∫ u du = (1/2) u² + C. Evaluated from 0 to pi.

At pi: sin(pi) = 0 → (1/2)(0)^2 = 0.

At 0: sin(0) = 0 → 0.

So, the integral is zero. That can't be right. Wait, that would imply the total power is zero, which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the entire sphere. Wait, but the problem is about the hemisphere, not the entire sphere. So, the integral is only from theta=0 to theta=pi/2, because it's a hemisphere. Wait, no: a hemisphere is half of a sphere, which is a sphere of radius R, and the hemisphere could be the upper half (theta from 0 to pi/2) or the lower half.

Wait, maybe the hemisphere is defined as a solid angle of 2pi steradians. So, perhaps the hemisphere is the area where theta (the polar angle) is less than or equal to pi/2.

Wait, no, a hemisphere in terms of solid angle is 2pi steradians. So, the hemisphere is any half of a sphere. So, perhaps the hemisphere is the portion where theta <= pi/2. But wait, no, that would be a smaller solid angle than 2pi. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the hemisphere is the solid angle of 2pi steradians, which is the same as a full sphere's 4pi minus the other hemisphere. So, I think the hemisphere is considered as all directions where theta is less than or equal to pi/2. Because that's the half of the sphere.

Wait, but if the hemisphere is the upper half, then the solid angle is 2pi steradians. So, the integral becomes:

I_0 ∫ (from theta=0 to pi/2) ∫ (from phi=0 to 2pi) cos(theta) sin(theta) dphi dtheta.

Because for a hemisphere, theta ranges from 0 to pi/2, not 0 to pi.

So, the integral becomes I_0 * [ ∫ from 0 to 2pi dphi ] * [ ∫ from 0 to pi/2 cos(theta) sin(theta) dtheta ]

The integral over phi is 2pi.

The integral over theta is ∫ cos(theta) sin(theta) dtheta from 0 to pi/2.

Let me compute that: let u = sin(theta), du = cos(theta) dtheta.

So, ∫ u du from u=0 to u=1 (since sin(0)=0, sin(pi/2)=1).

The integral is (1/2) u^2 from 0 to 1 → (1/2)(1) = 1/2.

So, the total power is I_0 * (2pi) * (1/2) ) = I_0 * pi.

So, the total power emitted into the hemisphere is I_0 * pi.

But the problem says that the hemisphere emits 50 mW. So, 50e-3 W = I_0 * pi.

Therefore, I_0 = 50e-3 / pi ≈ 50e-3 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.015915 mW.

Wait, but the question is asking for the radiant intensity. The radiant intensity is I_0 * cos(theta), but I think the question is about the average radiant intensity over the hemisphere. Or perhaps it's the maximum radiant intensity.

Wait, no, because in a hemisphere, the maximum occurs at theta=0, where cos(theta)=1. So, I_0 is the radiant intensity at the source direction (theta=0), which is the forward direction. So, the maximum radiant intensity in the hemisphere would be I_0.

But in this case, I_0 is 0.015915 mW.

Wait, but the question is about the radiant intensity, which is power per direction. Since the problem is about the hemisphere, the radiant intensity at any direction is I_0 * cos(theta). So, for the direction where theta is 0, the radiant intensity is I_0 ≈ 0.015915 mW.

But looking at the options, it's in W, not mW. So, 0.015915 mW is 0.000015915 W. Which is nowhere near the options given. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the problem. Let me think from the beginning. The problem states that the source emits 50 mW into a hemisphere. So, the total power in the hemisphere is 50 mW.

The question asks for the radiant intensity, which is the power per steradian. So, the total solid angle is 2π steradians, so the radiant intensity is 50e-3 W / (2π sr) ≈ 50e-3 / 6.2832 = approx 0.0079577 W/sr.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.00795, which matches this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the source is emitting into a hemisphere, but the total power is 50mW, so the radiant intensity is 50e-3 W / (2π sr) = same as before.

So, the correct answer is H.
</think>

The question asks for the radiant intensity of a Lambertian emitter that projects 50 mW into a hemisphere. To determine the radiant intensity, we calculate the power per steradian in the hemisphere. Since the total solid angle of the hemisphere is \(2\pi\) steradians, the radiant intensity is:

\[
I = \frac{50 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{W}}{2\pi \, \text{sr}} \approx \frac{0.05 \, \text{W}}{6.2832 \, \text{sr}} \approx 0.0079577 \, \text{W/sr}.
\]

Among the provided options, the closest match is **H: 0.00795 (W/sr)**. The other options differ by small amounts, but none align with the calculated value.
