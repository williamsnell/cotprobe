Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about logical behaviorism and how it relates to our common sense intuition about mental states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let me start by recalling what I know. Logical behaviorism is a school of thought in philosophy about the nature of mental states. I remember that it was developed by thinkers like John Searle, especially in the context of the mind-body problem. From what I understand, behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and how they relate to behavior.

The question is asking what is the logical behaviorist's view on our common sense intuition that mental states have a certain property. The options are A through J, each describing different aspects of mental states.

I think logical behaviorism posits that mental states are reducible to physical states. So, the behavior of the brain can be explained by physical processes. But wait, do they say that mental states are the same as behavioral states or that they exist independently?

Wait, another angle: behaviorism might view mental states as abstract entities that don't have direct physical counterparts. So, they're not physical states but rather mental phenomena. But then again, some people might argue that they are reducible to physical processes and thus can be observed or measured.

Wait, the options are about what they are. Let me read the options again.

Option G: are physical states. Option D: can be directly observed. Option H: can be measured quantitatively.

Wait, I think I remember that behaviorists, like Searle, might view mental states as abstract and not directly observable. So, if logical behaviorism says that mental states are reducible to physical states, then they might not actually "exist" in the same way as physical states. But wait, some sources say that behaviorists think mental states are like physical states because they're reducible. Others might say that they are not physical states but exist as mental phenomena.

Wait, but the question is about what logical behaviorism is at odds with our intuition. So, logical behaviorism might say that mental states are physical, whereas our common sense says they are not. Or perhaps the opposite.

I think I came across a specific point before. Searle, in his "The Matrix" analogy, suggests that mental states are like physical states, but they don't have physical implementations because the brain is a physical organism. So, maybe from logical behaviorism's perspective, mental states are not physical states. Therefore, the idea that they are physical states (G) would be the opposite of what behaviorism says. Wait, but the question is about what logical behaviorism is at odds with our intuition.

Wait, the question is phrased as: Logical behaviorism is at odds with our intuition that mental states [something]. So, if behaviorism says mental states are physical, then our intuition that they are not physical would be the opposite. Wait, but the options are about what the behaviorist says about mental states.

Wait, the options are:
A: cause behavior
B: are the same as behavioral states
C: exist
D: can be directly observed
E: are always visible
F: never interact with each other
G: are physical states
H: can be measured
I: never cause behavior
J: do not exist

Wait, the question is about what the behaviorist thinks about our intuition. So, if the behaviorist thinks that mental states are physical, then the intuition that they are not physical is at odds with the behaviorist's view. But the options are asking, what is the behaviorist's view on the intuition's property.

Wait, the question is phrased as: The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen. So, perhaps the options require choosing one, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the behaviorist would say about the common sense intuition that mental states are not physical. Or the other way around.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach this differently. I'll look for what Searle and others say about mental states. From what I remember, Searle argues that mental states are reducible to physical states, so they are not fundamentally different from physical states. Hence, mental states are physical states (G option) and thus their behavior can be observed and measured (H option).

Wait, no, that's not right. If they're reducible, then the behavior is physical, so the mental states exist as physical states. So, the behaviorist's view would be that mental states are physical (G), which is consistent with behaviorism. Hence, our intuition that they are not physical would be at odds with behaviorism, but the options are about the behaviorist's stance.

Wait, the question is "Logical behaviorism is at odds with our commonsense intuition that mental states [something]." So, the behaviorist's view on what the intuition says is the key. So, if the behaviorist thinks that mental states are physical, then our intuition that they are not physical would be the opposite of the behaviorist's view, meaning they are at odds with that intuition.

Wait, but the options are about the behaviorist's view on the intuition. The options are stating what the behaviorist's view is regarding the property of mental states as per the intuition.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G: are physical states. So, if the behaviorist thinks that mental states are physical, then the intuition that they are not physical would be at odds with that. So, the behaviorist's view is that mental states are physical, which would be the opposite of the intuition's view. So, the question is, the behaviorist's view is that mental states are physical, so the intuition that they are not physical would be at odds with it.

But the options are about what the behaviorist's view is regarding the intuition's property. So, the behaviorist's view is that mental states are physical (G), so our intuition (that they are not) is at odds.

Wait, but the question is not about the behaviorist's view on the intuition; rather, the question is about what the behaviorist says about the property of the mental states as per the intuition. So, the options are stating what the behaviorist's view is about how the intuition views mental states.

So, if the behaviorist believes that mental states are physical, then the intuition (if we hold that mental states are not physical) would be at odds with the behaviorist's view.

Wait, but the options are about what the behaviorist's view is about the property. So, for example, if the behaviorist says that mental states are physical, then the property they're talking about is physical. So, the answer would be G: are physical states.

Alternatively, if the behaviorist says that mental states are not physical, then their view is that they are not physical (G).

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try to approach it step by step.

The question is, what does the logical behaviorist say about the property of mental states as per our intuition?

Our common sense intuition is that mental states are not physical. So, the behaviorist might say that mental states are physical, so that intuition is at odds with that.

But the options are about what the behaviorist's view is regarding the property of mental states. So, the behaviorist's view is that mental states are physical (G), so our intuition that they are not physical is at odds with G.

Wait, but the options are phrased as the behaviorist's view on the property, not on the intuition. So, for example, the behaviorist says that mental states are physical (so G is their view), making the intuition (that they are not physical) at odds with that view.

Wait, but the question is phrased as the behaviorist's view is at odds with our intuition. So, the behaviorist's view is that mental states are physical (G), which is the opposite of our intuition, so they are at odds.

So, the correct answer would be G: are physical states.

Wait, but the options are about what the behaviorist's view is regarding the property. So, the behaviorist believes mental states are physical, so their view is G.

Alternatively, if the behaviorist thought that mental states are not physical, then their view would be that they are not physical (G is their view). So, the question is, what does the behaviorist think about our intuition's view.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each option implies.

Option G says "are physical states." So, the behaviorist's view is that mental states are physical. So, the question states that their view is at odds with our intuition, which would be the case if the behaviorist's view is that mental states are physical.

So, the correct answer is G: are physical states.
</think>

The question asks about the logical behaviorist's view on our intuition that mental states are not physical. Logical behaviorism posits that mental states are reducible to physical states, making them physical in nature. Therefore, the behaviorist's view is that mental states are physical (G). This aligns with the idea that behaviorists argue mental states exist as physical entities, such as physical states.

Answer: G
