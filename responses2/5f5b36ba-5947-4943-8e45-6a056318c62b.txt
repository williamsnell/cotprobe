Okay, I need to answer this question about the earliest kingdoms in South America. Let me think. The question is asking which civilization developed the first kingdom in South America and at what AD year it reached its peak. The options are A to I.

I remember that South America's earliest kingdoms are linked to the Aztec and possibly the Mayan civilization. The question mentions both Mayas and Aztecs. Wait, the options have both. Let me go through each option.

Option C: Olmec; AD 100. The Olmec were from Mesoamerica, specifically Yucatan, which is in South America. But I think the Olmec are more associated with Mesoamerica than with the early South American kingdoms. Also, I don't think they reached as high as the Aztecs.

Option B: Moche; AD 400. The Moche were the capital of the Inca civilization, which was there around AD 1000-1200. So that's much later than the Mayas.

Option H: Aztec; AD 200. The Aztecs were from what's now Mexico and modified parts of South America, including Yucatan. I remember that the Aztec built the Great Pyramid of the Sun at an earlier time, around AD 1300. But wait, the question is about the height, not the time of construction. The question says "reached its height" at a certain year. The Aztecs are known for their pyramid complexes, but I think the earliest was the Chacacán Pyramid in the Yucatan, which were built around AD 1300. But some sources say they were built around AD 1000 or earlier. However, I'm not sure if that's the earliest.

Option G: Wari; AD 100. The Wari people were native to North America, specifically the Yucatán Cusco region. But the question is about South America, so Wari isn't the answer.

Option D: Maya; AD 400. The Maya were also from Mesoamerica and were present around AD 300-400. They were one of the earliest civilizations in the region, but I think the Mayas are the first to have a major city, like Tikal, which is around AD 1300. So the Maya might have had the earliest kingdom, but that's around AD 400, while the Aztec is around AD 200. Wait, but maybe I got the order reversed.

Wait, the question is about the earliest kingdom. I thought the Mayas were the earliest, but the Aztecs are earlier in the Maya calendar. Let me clarify. The Mayas were from Mesoamerica, and the Aztecs were present in South America. The Mayas are from Yucatan and also parts of what is now Mexico, but the earliest South American kingdom might be the Aztec or the Maya. Wait, no: the Mayas are the earliest South American civilization, but the Aztecs are the first to have significant structures, like the Pyramid.

Wait, another angle: the Mayas are the earliest to have a major city, Tikal, around AD 1300. The Aztecs were there around AD 1300 as well, but their cities are in different regions. So the Maya were the first to have a major city. But the question is about the earliest kingdom, which would be the Maya, but the options don't have Maya as a choice. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option H is Aztec at AD 200, and option C is Olmec at AD 100. Option B is Moche at AD 400. So, the Aztecs are the first in the Mayas, but their earliest cities are around AD 1300, but some say the earliest was the Chacacán Pyramid at AD 1000.

Wait, I think the Mayas were the earliest, but perhaps the Aztecs were the first to have a major city. Or maybe the Mayas are the earliest, but the question is about the cities.

Another thought: the Mayas are the first to have a major city in Mesoamerica, so they would be the earliest. But in South America, some argue that the Maya were the first to have major cities, but perhaps the Aztecs were the first to have a major city there. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the earliest is the Olmec, but they were from Mesoamerica, which includes South America. Wait, the Olmec were from Yucatan, which is part of South America. But the Mayas were also there. So the earliest in South America would be the Olmec. But the options don't have Olmec. So perhaps the Aztecs are the first in the Mayas.

Wait, another angle. The Mayas are from Mesoamerica (South America) and Mayas are the first to have a major city, like Tikal. The Aztecs are from South America, also present in the north and parts of the south. So the Mayas are the first to have a major city, but the Aztecs were there in the early days. So the earliest in the Mayas is the Maya civilization, which was around AD 300-400. But wait, the Mayas are the first to have major cities, but the Aztecs were already there.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the earliest possible period. The Mayas were present around AD 1500-1000, but their major cities were built later. The Aztecs, on the other hand, were there already. So the Mayas were the first to have major cities, but the earliest known was the Chacacán Pyramid in AD 1000. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the question is about which civilization developed the first kingdom in South America. The Mayas were the first to have major cities, so the Mayas are the earliest. But the options don't have Maya as an option. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

H: Aztec; AD 200

G: Wari; AD 100

D: Maya; AD 400

So the Aztecs are the first to have major cities in the Mayas, and the Mayas are the first to have major cities in Mesoamerica, which includes South America. So the earliest is the Maya, but they are not an option.

Wait, the question is about the earliest kingdom. So the Mayas are the first to have major cities, but the Aztecs were already present. So the earliest in the Mayas would be the Maya, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is the Aztec, which are the earliest to have major cities there.

Wait, but the Mayas are the first to have major cities, so perhaps the answer is the Maya, but since it's not an option, maybe the Aztecs are the answer because they were the earliest to have a major city.

Alternatively, perhaps the Maya were the earliest to have major cities, but the options don't have Maya. So looking at the options, the Aztecs are the first to have major cities in Mesoamerica.

Wait, but the question is about the earliest in South America. So the Mayas are the earliest in Mesoamerica, which includes South America. So the Maya civilization is the earliest to have major cities.

But since the options don't have Maya, perhaps the closest is the Aztecs, who were present in the early days of Mesoamerica, including South America.

Alternatively, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

The Mayas were the first to have a major city, so the Mayas are the earliest. But the options don't have Maya. So perhaps the correct answer is the Aztecs, as they are the first to have major cities in South America.

Wait, another angle: the Mayas were the first to establish major cities, so the earliest in Mesoamerica, which includes South America. So the Maya are the first to have major cities.

But the options don't have Maya. So perhaps the correct answer is the Aztecs because they are the first to have major cities in Mesoamerica, including the South.

Wait, but the question is about the earliest in South America, so the Mayas are the first to have major cities. So the first kingdom in South America would be the Maya.

But the options don't have Maya. So perhaps the correct answer is the Aztecs, but I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: the Mayas are the first to have major cities, but the Aztecs were already present, so the Mayas are the earliest in Mesoamerica, which includes South America. But the options don't have the Maya option. So maybe the correct answer is the Aztecs, but they are the first in the Mayas.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the Olmec, but I don't think so because the Olmec are from Mesoamerica as well.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H: Aztec; AD 200. Because the Mayas were around AD 300-400, but the Aztecs were around AD 1300. But the Maya were present in South America around AD 1500-1000. So, the earliest in the Mayas would be the Maya. But since it's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is the Aztecs, which are the first to have major cities in Mesoamerica, including South America.

Wait, but the Mayas were also present in South America. So perhaps the Mayas are the first to have major cities, but the options don't have Maya as an option. So, given the options, the Aztecs are the first to have major cities, so the correct answer would be H: Aztec; AD 200. Alternatively, the Mayas are the first to have major cities, so the correct answer among the options would be either H or C.

Wait, but the options don't have Maya. So perhaps the correct answer is H: Aztec; AD 200 is the answer.

Alternatively, I might have misread the options. Let me look again.

Option B: Moche; AD 400.

Option H: Aztec; AD 200.

Option D: Maya; AD 400.

So, the Mayas were the first to have major cities, but since option C is Olmec, which I think is from Yucatan, but the Maya were later.

Wait, the Mayas were from Yucatan, which is part of South America, but the earliest in Mesoamerica is the Maya, not the Olmec.

So perhaps the correct answer is H: Aztec; AD 200.

Wait, but the Mayas were the first to have major cities, so their city sites were the earliest. But the question is about the latest: the first kingdom in South America.

Wait, perhaps the answer is the Aztecs, as they were the first to have major cities in Mesoamerica, including South America.

So I think the correct answer is option H: Aztec; AD 200.

But I'm a bit confused because the Mayas were the first to have major cities. So if the options don't have Maya, the closest would be the Aztecs.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options provided and their historical context. The Mayas are the first to establish major cities in Mesoamerica, including South America, around AD 1500-1000. However, the Aztecs were already present in South America and were the first to have significant structures, such as the Pyramid of Chacacán, around AD 1000. The Mayas are the earliest to have major cities, but since option C (Olmec) is not an available choice, the closest answer among the options provided is the Aztecs, who were the first to have major cities in South America.
