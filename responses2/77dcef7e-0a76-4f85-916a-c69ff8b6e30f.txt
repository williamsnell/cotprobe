Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Thompson's classroom and the seating arrangement. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 7 desks arranged in a row. That means there are 7 seats in a straight line. Each desk is a seat, so each person sits in one seat, and each seat is next to the other.

The question is about the positions of three people: Kim, Hector, and Tonya. It says Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim. Then, Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector. The question is asking how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Let's assign numbers to the desks to make it easier. Let's say the first desk is position 1, the second is 2, and so on up to position 7.

So, starting with Kim. Let's denote her position as K. Then Hector is 2 seats to the right, so his position is K + 2. Tonya is 3 seats to the right of Hector, so her position is (K + 2) + 3 = K + 5.

Wait, but wait, because if the desks are in a row, their positions can't exceed 7. So K must be such that all their positions are within 1 to 7. Let me think about possible values for K.

If K is 1: Hector is at 3, Tonya at 8. Oh wait, 8 is beyond 7 desks. So that's not possible. So K can't be 1 because then Tonya would be at 8, which doesn't exist. So K must be such that K + 5 is ≤7. Let's solve for K.

K +5 ≤7 → K ≤2.

So K can be 1 or 2.

Let's check K=1: then Hector is at 3, Tonya at 8 (invalid). So K=1 is invalid.

Next, K=2: Hector is at 4, Tonya at 7. That works because 7 is the last desk.

So in this scenario, Kim is at 2, Hector at 4, and Tonya at 7.

Now the question is, how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit? So, Kim is at position 2, Tonya at 7. To find how many seats are between them, from Kim's side to Tonya's. So from 2 to 7, how many seats are in between?

The number of seats between two positions is (Tonya's position - Kim's position - 1). Wait, no, that would give the count of seats in between. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the distance from Kim to Tonya is 7 - 2 = 5 seats. But since we're counting how many seats to the left of Tonya that Kim is, it's the same as the distance from Tonya to Kim. So it's 5 seats.

Wait, wait, no. Because in a row, the distance is the same in both directions. So if you're sitting at position X and someone is at Y, the number of seats in between is |Y - X| -1. But the question is how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit. So that would be the number of seats between Kim and Tonya, including any seats from Kim to Tonya. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it as positions. If Kim is at 2 and Tonya at 7, how many seats are to the left of Tonya that Kim is sitting. So if you're at Tonya's desk, how many desks are to your left? That's 7 - 2 =5 desks. So the answer is 5 seats to the left of Tonya where Kim sits.

Looking at the options, option I is 5. So the answer should be I:5.

The correct answer is **I: 5**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. Assign positions to the desks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
2. Let Kim's position be K. Hector is at K + 2, Tonya at (K + 2) + 3 = K + 5.
3. Since Tonya must be within 7 desks, K + 5 ≤ 7 → K ≤ 2.
4. Testing K=2: Hector at 4, Tonya at 7.
5. Distance from Kim (2) to Tonya (7) is 7 - 2 = 5 seats. Thus, Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.

**Answer:** I:5
