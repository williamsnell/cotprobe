B: rated the group as less interesting and enjoyable.
C: felt more alienated within the group.
D: felt more indifferent towards the group.
E: were less likely to contribute to group activities.
F: were more likely to assume leadership roles within the group.
G: were more likely to dislike fellow group members.
H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable.
I: were less likely to recommend the group to others.
J: experienced less satisfaction from group activities.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a study by Arsonson and Mills. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about the effects of an initiator's level on attitudes towards a group. So, the scenario is: women who undergo a mild initiation compared to those who undergo a severe one as a precondition. The options are all about what happens to their attitudes.

I remember that group dynamics can be influenced by how people initiate into the group. Mild initiation might mean they're more active or take more risks, whereas severe initiation could mean they're more dominant or make strong decisions.

The question is about their outcomes. Let's go through each option:

Option A: More likely to drop out. I think that might be more about behavior than just the initiator's level. But maybe if the initiator is more dominant, others might follow, leading to dropouts. But not sure if that's the main effect.

Option B: Less interesting and enjoyable. If the initiator is more dominant, perhaps the group becomes more structured, leading to a more enjoyable environment. So maybe this isn't the case.

Option C: Felt more alienated. If the initiator is more dominant, perhaps they're the main point of reference, so others might feel less connected. That could be possible.

Option D: Felt more indifferent. Maybe because they're more dominant, others might not feel as much support, leading to less interest.

Option E: Less likely to contribute. If the initiator is dominant, maybe others are more likely to follow, so they might not contribute much. That makes sense.

Option F: Assumed leadership roles. If the initiator is dominant, maybe they're seen as more influential, so others assume leadership. But I'm not sure if that's the outcome here.

Option G: More likely to dislike others. If the initiator is dominant, perhaps others feel less connected or that the group is less interesting. So maybe they'd feel more alienated or even dislike others.

Option H: More interesting and enjoyable. That seems opposite of what's expected if someone is dominant. The initiator might make the group more structured.

Option I: Less likely to recommend the group. If initiator is dominant, maybe the group is more structured, so people might not want to recommend it.

Option J: Less satisfaction. Maybe the group is structured and more ordered, leading to lower satisfaction.

Wait, the study's main focus is the initial initiator's level's effect on subsequent attitudes. So Arsonson and Mills' study... I think when a group is initiated by a dominant member, the group becomes more ordered, more structured, and more enjoyable. So, the initiator's dominance affects the group's dynamics.

Now, looking at the options, option H says they rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable. That would be the expected outcome if the initiator is dominant. So in that case, the women who underwent a severe initiation would have a more interesting group.

But wait, the question is comparing women who underwent a mild initiation versus a severe one. So if the severe initiator leads to a more structured group, which would be option H.

Wait, but option G says they felt more alienated. If the initiator is dominant, others might feel disconnected, so they'd feel less connected. So perhaps option C is also possible.

Wait, the options are each a possible outcome. So, the question is what happens when the initiator is severe. So for severe initiator: result is either more interesting, more structured, less structured, etc.

So if the initiator is dominant, the group becomes more structured, leading to more enjoyment, which is option H. Alternatively, if the initiator is more dominant, the group might become less connected, leading to more alienation, which is option C.

Wait, but the question is about the impact on attitudes. So, in the study, the women undergoing a severe initiator would likely have different experiences. If the initiator is dominant, perhaps the group is more enjoyable, more organized, which would make them feel more interested. Alternatively, perhaps the initiator's dominance leads to a more hierarchical structure, making the group less connected, so they feel more alienated.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Arsonson and Mills' study, if I remember correctly, found that a dominant initiator leads to a more harmonious group. For instance, in some experiments, when a dominant member initiates, the group is more likely to be successful and enjoyable. So women who undergo a severe initial might have a more structured group, which would be option H.

Alternatively, maybe when a group is started by a dominant individual, it's more connected. So perhaps they would be more likely to contribute more and more positively, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the more dominant the initiator, the more structured the group, so they'd feel more connected (option C), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: in a group initiated by a dominant member, the initiator is the most influential, so others might feel more connected as they follow. So they might think the group is more interesting because the initiator is dominant. So option G says they felt more disliked. Hmm.

Wait, option G says "felt more likely to dislike fellow group members." If the initiator is dominant, perhaps others aren't as connected, leading to less connection, which might make them feel less connected to others, thus more likely to feel more disconnected.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about which options make sense. 

The question is about the impact of the initiator's level. Mild initiation might lead to a more open group, perhaps more disengaged. Severe initiation could lead to a more dominant group, more structured, more harmonious, which would make some of the women feel more connected, others perhaps more disengaged.

Option C: felt more alienated. That would make sense if the group is structured and less connected.

Option G: felt more likely to dislike others. If the initiator is dominant, perhaps the group is more hierarchical, leading to less connection.

Wait, but the options are about what the women experienced. So which outcome is a result of their initiator being severe.

Let me think about their attitudes. If the initiator was mild, perhaps the group didn't have strong leadership or structure, leading to less interest, perhaps they didn't contribute much, so their attitudes might be more negative. But if the initiator was severe, the group becomes more structured, so their attitudes might change.

Alternatively, if the initiator is dominant, the group becomes more successful and enjoyable, so the women might have more positive attitudes towards the group.

Wait, but the question is comparing women who underwent a mild initiation versus a severe one. So the severer the initiator, the more structured the group, leading to more enjoyment, perhaps leading to more positive attitudes.

Looking at the options again, option H says rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable. That would be the expected outcome if the initiator is dominant, because the group is more structured and the initiator makes the group more orderly.

So, the women who underwent a severe initiator would have more positive attitudes towards the group. So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but what about option G? If the initiator is dominant, perhaps women feel less connected, so they would feel more likely to dislike others, which would make them feel more alienated.

So, if the initiator is severe, leading to a dominant group, then women might feel more alienated (option C) rather than more interested.

But the question is about the effect of the initiator's level on their attitudes. So, the severer the initiator, more structured group, more interesting and enjoyable, so option H.

Alternatively, maybe the severer the initiator, the more they like the group. So option H.

Wait, but the options are each a possible outcome. So if the initiator is severe, what's the effect?

Wait, but the question is about their attitudes. So severe initiator would lead to group being more structured, more enjoyable, leading to more positive attitudes, which is option H.

Wait, but another possibility is that a dominant initiator makes the group more ordered, so the women would feel more connected, but not as much as a less dominant initiator.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let's try to think of the possible outcomes. If the initiator is dominant, the group is more ordered, so the women might feel more connected, but perhaps more disengaged. So perhaps they would feel more connected, which is a negative outcome (like being more likely to assume leadership roles, which is option F, but that's not the case).

Alternatively, if the initiator is dominant, maybe the group is more ordered, so the women might feel more satisfied with the group's structure, leading them to feel more interested in the group (option G). However, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the original question. The options are:

The question is, when a group is initiated by a severe initiator, what happens? So if the initiator is severe, the group is likely to be more structured, so more ordered, more enjoyable, more structured, so more interesting and enjoyable.

So the correct answer would be H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the possible outcomes. Another approach: the question is about the effect of initiator level on subsequent attitudes. So, if the initiator is mild, the group is probably more open, less structured, so the women might be less interested, leading to option B (less interesting and enjoyable). If the initiator is severe, the group is more structured, so they're more interested, option H.

Yes, that makes sense. So option H is the correct answer.
</think>

The study by Arsonson and Mills examines the effects of an initiator's level on group attitudes. When a group is initiated by a dominant individual, the initiator becomes the most influential and structured member, leading to a more ordered and harmonious group. This structure facilitates a more positive and satisfying experience for the women involved, resulting in higher levels of interest and satisfaction towards the group.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A: More likely to drop out**  
  This is more related to behavior than initiator level. Not relevant here.

- **B: Rated the group as less interesting and enjoyable**  
  If the initiator is mild, the group might be more open and disorganized, leading to lower interest and enjoyment. This is an incorrect outcome for a mild initiator.

- **C: Felt more alienated within the group**  
  A dominant initiator can lead to a more hierarchical and disconnected group, resulting in feelings of alienation. This could be a possible outcome, depending on the initiator's dominance.

- **D: Felt more indifferent towards the group**  
  A severe initiator could make the group more structured and enjoyable, leading to increased interest and less indifferent attitude. This is less likely.

- **E: Were less likely to contribute to group activities**  
  A dominant initiator might make the group more structured, less flexible, and less likely to engage in free contribution. This is an incorrect outcome.

- **F: Were more likely to assume leadership roles within the group**  
  A dominant initiator could lead to more hierarchical structures, with others assuming leadership roles. This is an incorrect outcome.

- **G: Were more likely to dislike fellow group members**  
  A dominant initiator might make the group more hierarchical, leading to feelings of disconnection and disliking others. This is possible but less likely than positive outcomes.

- **H: Rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable**  
  A severe initiator leads to a structured and harmonious group, which is more interesting and enjoyable. This is the correct outcome.

- **I: Were less likely to recommend the group to others**  
  A structured group might be more reliable, making recommendations more likely. This is incorrect.

- **J: Were less satisfied from group activities**  
  A structured group could be less engaging, leading to lower satisfaction. This is an incorrect outcome.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable**, as a severe initiator leads to a structured and harmonious group, which is more enjoyable and interesting.
