Question:

A buyer contracted in writing to purchase 1,000 gidgets (which are similar to widgets but are more popular because of their greater durability and- resiliency) from a manufacturer for a total contract price of $4,000. After this agreement was executed and before delivery, the buyer and the manufacturer agreed in a telephone conversation to change the quantity term from 1,000 to 800 gidgets. This modification is probably unenforceable, because

Options:

A: it violates the statute of frauds.
B: the buyer did not provide sufficient notice.
C: it was a verbal agreement, not a written one.
D: the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.
E: the manufacturer did not agree to the modification.
F: the original contract was in writing.
G: the price was not adjusted to reflect the change in quantity.
H: there was no consideration.
I: the telephone conversation was not recorded.
J: there was no written agreement to the modification.

Okay, so I need to figure out why this modification of the contract is unenforceable. The buyer contracted to buy 1,000 gidgets for $4,000. Then they agreed to change to 800 gidgets in a phone conversation before delivery. Hmm.

I remember that contracts must be in writing for enforceability, especially if there's an intent to change the quantity. Wait, because contracts are enforceable only if they're in writing. So if the original contract wasn't in writing, changing it in a later conversation might not hold.

Looking at the options, option A says it violates the statute of frauds. But I think the statute of frauds is more about whether goods are intended to be destroyed or destroyed for a profit. That doesn't directly apply here. The issue is whether the contract is enforceable at all, not about the goods' value.

Option B suggests the buyer didn't provide enough notice. The modification was made in a telephone conversation, which is a less formal method. If the buyer wasn't fully informed in writing, maybe the original contract wasn't enforceable. But isn't the statute of frauds about intent to destroy, not about whether the contract was in writing?

Option C is about the agreement being verbal. Yes, I remember that if the agreement is not in writing, it's void. So a verbal agreement wouldn't be enforceable, making C a strong possibility.

Option D: parol evidence rule. I think the parol evidence rule applies to situations where a party's statements are being used in a trial by law. Here, the modification was in a later conversation before delivery. The original agreement was in writing, so the modification could be considered under the parol evidence rule. But wait, the parol evidence rule usually applies if the original agreement is not in writing, and the modification is in a later conversation. So that would make the modification enforceable, but if the original wasn't in writing, then the modification might not be enforceable. Wait no, the parol evidence rule is about whether the parties can rely on the prior conversation in a subsequent one, especially in a trial. So if the original contract was in writing, but the modification is in a later, unrecorded conversation, the parol evidence rule might prevent the modification from being enforced. So I'm a bit confused here. I'll need to think more.

Option E: the manufacturer didn't agree. The question says the buyer and manufacturer agreed. So E is not correct.

Option F: original contract was in writing. But the question says it was a contract for 1000 gidgets, which is a lot. If the original was in writing, then changing to a smaller quantity should be enforceable unless there's a statute of frauds issue.

Wait, the statute of frauds applies to goods intended for destruction. If the gidgets are not intended for destruction, the statute doesn't apply. So the original contract being in writing doesn't violate the statute of frauds, because the issue isn't about destruction. So option A is not about that.

So the main issue is whether the modification was in writing. If the original contract was in writing, then a subsequent verbal or telephonic agreement may not be enforceable. So the modification is probably unenforceable because it wasn't in writing.

Looking at the options again: option C says it's a verbal agreement, not a written one. That would make it unenforceable. So I think the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the parol evidence rule (option D) is about whether the original agreement was in writing. Because if the original contract was in writing, the modification might not have to be in parol evidence. But I'm getting a bit confused between the two.

Wait, the parol evidence rule is about whether the original agreement is in writing. If the original contract was in writing, then the modification in a later conversation may not be enforceable unless the parties have agreed. But in this case, the original was in writing, and the modification was done in a later, unrecorded conversation. So the modification probably doesn't hold because the contract wasn't in writing. So the correct answer would be C.
</think>

The modification of the contract is likely unenforceable because it was not in writing. The key issue is whether the original contract was enforceable. Since the original contract was in writing, a subsequent verbal agreement, such as a telephone conversation, is not enforceable under the statute of frauds. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: it was a verbal agreement, not a written one.**
