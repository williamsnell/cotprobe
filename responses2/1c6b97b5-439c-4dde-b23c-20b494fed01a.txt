Okay, so I've got this question about hearsay and evidence admissibility. Let me try to break it down. 

The question says that an investor is suing a speculator, and there's a suit by an investor against a speculator. The relevant fact is the price of gold as quoted on a specific date 20 years ago. The investor calls a librarian to authenticate a microfilm copy of a newspaper from that date. The copy is the only record of that particular issue of the newspaper. The microfilm is being discussed as evidence.

The options are about whether the microfilm is admissible. So, I need to figure out what evidence rule applies here.

First, I remember that hearsay is a declaration made in response to a question that could be answered by another party's knowledge or a fact that could be verified by someone else. So, the key here is whether the microfilm can be used as a hearsay.

The library records exception to the hearsay rule is a possible answer. I think that exception applies when the record in question is a public record. The public records exception allows hearsay to be admitted if the source is a public record. Wait, but in this case, the microfilm is a copy, not a record. So, is the microfilm itself considered a public record?

Wait, the problem states that the microfilm is the only record of that particular issue. So, perhaps the public library has a physical copy of that newspaper. If the library has a record of the newspaper's issue, and the microfilm is that record, then the library's record is a public record.

So, if the microfilm is a public record, the library's records exception to hearsay would apply. That would make the microfilm admissible as a public record.

Looking at the options, option C says "admissible under the library records exception to the hearsay rule." That sounds right. 

But wait, the library's records exception typically applies when the source of the record is part of a public record. So, for example, if the library has a copy of the newspaper, then the copy (the microfilm) is a public record. So, the library's record would be considered a public record, and thus the microfilm can be used as a public record.

Alternatively, another option is that because it's a microfilm, it's a copy, so it's inadmissible as hearsay. Wait, but the options don't have that.

Looking again at the options:

A: Admissible as public record.

C: Admissible under the library records exception.

So, the correct reasoning is that the microfilm is a public record, so it's admissible under the library exception.

Wait, let me think again. The library's copy is the only record. So, the public library has a copy of that newspaper, which is the microfilm. So, the library's record is a public record. Therefore, the microfilm is a public record, so it can be used as a public record.

So, the correct answer is C: admissible under the library records exception.

The microfilm, which is the only record of that particular issue of the newspaper, is considered a public record. This allows the microfilm to be admissible under the library records exception to the hearsay rule.
