Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the School of jurisprudence and which school believes that the law is an aggregate of social traditions and customs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my jurisprudence, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that jurisprudence is the study of law, and there are different schools within this. The question is asking for the name of the school that views law as the sum of social trends and customs developed over time.

I think the main schools of jurisprudence are the Command, Sociological, Historical, Interpretive, Analytical, Functional, Natural, Realist, Positivist, and Pragmatic schools. Wait, but I'm not too sure about each one.

Let me try to recall. The Command School, I believe, focuses on the authority of the law and the exercise of power. The Sociological School, I think, looks at how social trends influence the law, which aligns with the idea of an aggregate of social practices. The Historical School would probably focus on the past developments, so that's more about how laws have evolved, not the current trends.

The Interpretive School is more about understanding the law through its implications and meaning, not necessarily the aggregate of trends. The Analytical School might be more concerned with the structure and reasoning behind the law, not the social origins.

The Natural School would be about how nature and natural processes shape the law, which is different. The Functional School looks at the law as a system that serves social functions, which could tie into social traditions. The Realist School probably values the facts and the law as true, without much consideration for social factors. The Positivist School would focus on observable evidence, not necessarily on trends. The Pragmatic School, as I recall, looks at how laws are used in practice and their effectiveness.

Wait, so the Sociological School (Option B) is the one that considers the law as a result of social traditions and customs. Because the question states that the law is an aggregate of these social factors. Yeah, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be B: Sociological.

The correct answer is B: Sociological. The Sociological School of jurisprudence views the law as influenced by social traditions and customs, aligning with the idea presented in the question.

Answer: B
