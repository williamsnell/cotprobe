Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through carefully. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about determining the probability that event T occurred, given that both witness Alf and Bob claim it happened. The reliability of the two witnesses is given: Alf tells the truth with probability α and Bob with probability β. These two are independent, and their statements don't influence each other. The probability that event T actually occurs is τ, which is 1/1000 here. The options are multiple-choice, so I need to compute the probability and pick the correct one.

Hmm, so I think I should use Bayes' theorem here because this is a conditional probability problem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). In this case, I need to find P(T | A ∧ B), which is the probability that T occurred given that both Alf and Bob said it happened.

Let me break it down. 

First, let's define the events:
- T: Event T occurred.
- A: Alf claims T occurred.
- B: Bob claims T occurred.

We need to find P(T | A and B). 

Using Bayes' theorem, this can be rewritten as P(T) * P(A|T) * P(B|T) divided by P(A and B). But since A and B are independent, right? Wait, no, actually, A and B are the events that Alf and Bob say T occurred. But since they're independent, the joint probability P(A and B) is P(A) * P(B), because their statements are independent. 

Wait, but actually, the problem states that Alf and Bob are independent witnesses. So their statements are independent events. So P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up some concepts here. Let me clarify.

The problem says Alf and Bob are independent. So their statements T and their claims are independent. But wait, the actual truth of T is also a variable. So, I think I need to model this with the probabilities of their statements given the truth of T.

So, let's model this step by step.

The probability that Alf tells the truth is α. That is, P(A|T) = α, and P(not A|T) = 1−α. Similarly, for Bob, P(B|T) = β and P(not B|T) = 1−β.

But since T didn't necessarily happen, the prior probability of T is given as τ = 1/1000, and the prior probability of not T is 1−τ. But I think the problem is asking for the probability that T occurred given that both said it happened, which is P(T | A and B).

So, applying Bayes' theorem:

P(T | A and B) = [P(A and B | T) * P(T)] / P(A and B)

But since A and B are independent, P(A and B | T) = P(A|T) * P(B|T) = αβ. 

And P(A and B) is the total probability that both Alfs and Bob say T happened, regardless of whether it actually happened or not. So, P(A and B) can be calculated as P(A and B | T) * P(T) + P(A and B | not T) * P(not T).

Wait, that makes sense. Because the joint probability of A and B can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either T happened and both said it happened, or T didn't happen and both said it happened. So, using the law of total probability:

P(A and B) = P(A and B | T) P(T) + P(A and B | not T) P(not T).

Okay, so let's compute each part.

We have:

P(T) = τ = 1/1000 = 0.001.

P(not T) = 1 − τ = 0.999.

P(A|T) = α = 9/10 = 0.9.

P(B|T) = β = 9/10 = 0.9.

P(A|not T) = 1 - α = 0.1.

P(B|not T) = 1 - β = 0.1.

So, first, compute P(A and B | T) = P(A|T) * P(B|T) = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81.

P(A and B | not T) = P(A|not T) * P(B|not T) = 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01.

Now, P(A and B) = [P(A and B | T) * P(T)] + [P(A and B | not T) * P(not T)].

Plugging in the numbers:

P(A and B) = (0.81 * 0.001) + (0.01 * 0.999).

Let me compute each term:

0.81 * 0.001 = 0.00081.

0.01 * 0.999 = 0.00999.

Adding them together: 0.00081 + 0.00999 = 0.0108.

So P(A and B) is 0.0108.

Now, plugging into Bayes' formula:

P(T | A and B) = [P(A and B | T) * P(T)] / P(A and B)

Which is (0.81 * 0.001) / 0.0108.

Compute numerator: 0.81 * 0.001 = 0.00081.

Divide by denominator 0.0108:

0.00081 / 0.0108. Let me calculate this.

Well, 0.00081 ÷ 0.0108 = (8.1 × 10^-4) / (1.08 × 10^-2) ) = (8.1 / 108) × (10^-4 / 10^-2) )= (0.075) × (10^-2) )= 0.0075.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 0.00081 is 8.1e-4 and 0.0108 is 1.08e-2.

So, 8.1e-4 divided by 1.08e-2 is (8.1 / 108) ) × (1e-4 / 1e-2) ) → 0.075 × 0.01 = 0.00075.

Wait, that can't be right because 0.00075 is 0.075%, but looking at the answer options, the closest to 0.0075 is not present. Wait, wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 0.00081 divided by 0.0108.

Let me compute this more carefully.

0.00081 / 0.0108 = ?

I can write this as 81 / 10800.

Wait, 81 divided by 10800.

Wait, 81 ÷ 108 = 0.75. So 81 ÷ 10800 = 0.75 × 10^-1 = 0.075.

So, the probability is 0.075, which is 7.5%.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.075 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 0.120

B: 0.082

C: 0.001

D: 0.025

E: 0.050

F: 0.075

G: 0.100

H: 0.150

I: 0.200

J: 0.010

So, F is 0.075, which is exactly what I calculated. So the answer is F: 0.075.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check all the steps because sometimes when you're doing math, it's easy to make a mistake.

So the formula again: P(T | A and B) = [P(A and B | T) * P(T)] / P(A and B).

P(A and B | T) is 0.9*0.9=0.81.

P(T)=0.001.

P(A and B) = P(A and B | T)*P(T) + P(A and B | not T)*P(not T).

Which is 0.81*0.001 + (0.1 * 0.1)*0.999.

0.81 * 0.001 is 0.00081.

0.1 *0.1 is 0.01, multiplied by 0.999 is 0.00999.

Adding them: 0.00081 + 0.00999 = 0.0108.

Then, [0.00081] / 0.0108 = 0.075.

So yes, 0.075 is the result.

Looking at the options, F is 0.075. So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the probability that event T occurred given that both Alfs and Bob declared it, we apply Bayes' theorem. The calculations show that the probability is 0.075, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F: 0.075
