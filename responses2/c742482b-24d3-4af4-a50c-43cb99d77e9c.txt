Okay, so I have this question about arson charges. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The scenario is a defendant and his friend are drinking heavily at the friend's house. Both become intoxicated. Then, after some hours, both pass out. In the middle of the night, the defendant wakes up with a headache. He goes to the kitchen and pours himself another shot of whiskey. He also feels hungry and decides to make eggs. Then, he forgets to turn off the stove, which caused a gas leak leading to a fire that destroys the house. The question is whether the defendant is guilty of arson and what charges he would face.

First, I need to understand what constitutes arson. From what I remember, arson is a felony that requires the intentional destruction of a significant amount of firework or flammable material and the intentional cause of that destruction. Also, the person must be in a position of recklessness or negligence, meaning they acted with the intent to harm another, even if they were aware of the consequences.

In this case, the defendant was in a state of intoxication when he fell asleep and poured whiskey. Then he ate eggs, which are edible and not flammable. There was no mention of any gas leak during eating, just that he forgot to turn off the stove. The gas leak happened after he had already started cooking, which might have been dangerous.

Wait, the scenario says the gas leak was caused by forgetting to turn off the stove. So the stove was left on during the cooking, which would have caused a fire. Because he forgot to turn it off, he was in immediate danger of a fire. But does that mean he was negligent in the act of turning it off? Because turning off the stove is a duty, and he didn't do it. 

In terms of negligence, if he didn't turn off the stove, that would be a failure to act. Because the act of turning off the stove is a criminal offense, and he didn't do it. So his failure to act was negligent.

But wait, the key is whether the act of turning off the stove was a part of the act that caused the fire. He was in a state of intoxication, but he also failed to turn off the stove, which was the immediate cause of the fire.

So, the defendant was in a position of recklessness because he was in immediate danger and did not take the necessary step, which is a failure to act (negligence). And the act of turning off the stove is a criminal offense, so his negligence would lead to a charge of arson.

But wait, is there another angle? The defendant was in a state of intoxication. Does that negate the elements of criminal negligence?

I think that the elements of criminal negligence require that the defendant knew the act was wrong or was aware of the consequences. Intoxication doesn't necessarily negate that. For example, if someone is in a state of intoxication and does something wrong, like turning off the stove, the state might not consider that negligence because the person was not lawfully acting, but sometimes drunk drivers can be considered negligent if they acted recklessly.

Hmm, but in this case, the defendant was in a position of recklessness because he was in immediate danger when he fell asleep. So the failure to act was a criminal offense, which would make him guilty of negligence. And the act of turning off the stove is a crime, so the main charge would be arson.

Wait, but what about the fact that he was in a state of intoxication? Does that affect the charge of arson? I think that the state of intoxication is generally not a defense to an arrest for a felony like arson, unless it's a medical condition or something. But I'm not sure.

So, to recap: The defendant's negligence includes turning off the stove, which is a crime, and he was in a position of recklessness, so he's guilty of negligence, which is part of arson. So he's guilty of arson.

Looking at the options:

A: guilty because reckless. But does intoxication negate recklessness? I'm not sure, but the primary charge is negligence.

B: not guilty, because he wasn't aware of the gas leak. That's not correct because he was in a position of recklessness and didn't act. So he was aware; he was in danger.

C: guilty because of negligence. That seems right.

D: Not guilty because he didn't commit a felony. Arson is a felony, so he must be guilty.

E: guilty because he caused property damage. No, a fire is property damage, but the main charge is arson.

F: guilty because he was intoxicated. The question is about charges, not whether he was intoxicated.

G: not guilty because of malice. Malice isn't a factor here because he didn't commit a felony.

H: guilty because he failed to turn off the stove. That's a part of the negligence, but the main charge is the act of turning off the stove itself, which is a crime.

So the correct answer should be C: guilty, because the defendant was criminally negligent.
</think>

The defendant was in a position of recklessness, as he was in immediate danger when he fell asleep and poured whiskey. Additionally, his failure to turn off the stove constitutes a criminal offense, making him criminally negligent. The act of turning off the stove is a crime, and the defendant's negligence in this act leads to an arrest for arson. The state of intoxication does not negate his recklessness. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: C
