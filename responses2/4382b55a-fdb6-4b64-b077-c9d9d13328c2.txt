Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. It says that x and y are positive integers such that 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. I need to figure out which of the given options must also be divisible by 11. The options are A through J, each a linear combination of x and y.

Hmm, I remember that if a certain expression is divisible by a number, then when you manipulate it using modular arithmetic, it should also satisfy the divisibility condition. Since 3x + 7y is divisible by 11, that means 3x + 7y ≡ 0 mod 11. I can use this congruence to simplify the other expressions.

Let me think about the possible options. Each option is another linear combination. Maybe I can express each option in terms of 3x + 7y and see if that expression is zero modulo 11.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 7x + 3y. Hmm, I wonder if I can write this in terms of 3x +7y. Let's see. If I multiply 3x +7y by some factor, maybe I can get something similar. Let me try another approach. Since 3x +7y is 0 mod11, maybe I can find coefficients a and b such that a*(3x+7y) + something equals option A.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a multiple of 3x +7y that gives me 7x +3y. Let me set up an equation: a*(3x +7y) ≡ 7x +3y mod11.

Expanding this: 3a x +7a y ≡7x +3y mod11. So, 3a ≡7 mod11 and 7a≡3 mod11.

Let me solve for a. From the first equation, 3a ≡7 mod11. Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod11. The inverse of 3 mod11 is a number m where 3m ≡1 mod11. Testing m=4 because 3*4=12≡1 mod11. So m=4.

So a ≡7*4=28≡6 mod11. Now check if 7a ≡3 mod11. 7*6=42≡42-33=9≡9 mod11. But we need it to be 3. Hmm, that doesn't work. So maybe this approach is not the right way. Maybe I should try to express 7x +3y in terms of 3x +7y.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a linear combination. Let me consider 3x +7y = 0 mod11.

I want 7x +3y. Let me try to manipulate 3x +7y. Let's see, let me multiply 3x +7y by 5: 15x +35y. Then take mod11: 15 mod11 is 4, 35 mod11 is 2. So 4x +2y ≡ (3x +7y)*5 mod11. But that's 0*5 = 0 mod11. So 4x +2y ≡0 mod11.

Now, if I have 3x +7y ≡0, and 4x +2y ≡0, can I use these to find 7x +3y?

Wait, maybe I can solve the two equations:

3x +7y ≡0 mod11

4x +2y ≡0 mod11

Let me write them as:

3x +7y =11k (for some integer k)

4x +2y =11m (for some integer m)

So I have two equations:

3x +7y =11k

4x +2y =11m

I can solve this system for x and y. Let me multiply the second equation by 3: 12x +6y =33m.

Multiply the first equation by 4: 12x +28y =44k.

Subtract the second multiplied equation from the first multiplied equation:

(12x +28y) - (12x +6y)=44k -33m

22y=11(4k -3m)

Divide both sides by 11: 2y=4k -3m → y= (4k -3m)/2.

Hmm, but this might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can solve for x and y.

From the second equation: 4x +2y =11m → 2x +y = (11m)/2. Wait, but 11m must be even for y to be integer, so m must be even. Let me set m=2n, then 2x + y=11n.

From the first equation: 3x +7y=11k.

Let me express x from the second equation: x = (11n - y)/2.

Substitute into the first equation: 3*(11n - y)/2 +7y =11k.

Multiply through by 2: 3*(11n - y) +14y =22k.

33n -3y +14y =22k →33n +11y=22k → 11(3n + y)=22k → 3n + y = (22k)/11=2k.

So, y=2k -3n.

Substitute back into x= (11n - y)/2 → x=(11n - (2k -3n))/2 = (11n -2k +3n)/2=(14n -2k)/2=7n -k.

So x=7n -k, y=2k -3n.

Now, let's compute 7x +3y.

Substitute x and y:

7*(7n -k) +3*(2k -3n) =49n -7k +6k -9n = (49n -9n) + (-7k +6k) =40n -k.

Wait, does 40n -k≡0 mod11? Let's see: 40 mod11 is 7 (since 33 is 3*11, so 40-33=7). So 40n ≡7n mod11. And -k mod11 is (-k) mod11. So 7n -k ≡0 mod11?

But in our earlier equations, we had 2y=4k -3m → 2y=4k -3*(2n) →2y=4k-6n. Hmm, but maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe another way: Let's think about 7x +3y in terms of 3x +7y.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that 3x +7y is 0 mod11, so 3x ≡-7y mod11. Let's substitute into 7x +3y:

7x +3y =7x +3y. Since 3x ≡-7y, then 7x =7x. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let me express x in terms of y or vice versa.

Wait, from 3x +7y ≡0 mod11, I can write 3x ≡-7y mod11. Then x ≡ (-7y)/(3) mod11. Since 3^{-1} mod11 is 4, because 3*4=12≡1 mod11. So x ≡ (-7y)*4 mod11 → x ≡ (-28y) mod11. 28 mod11 is 6, so x ≡ (-6y) mod11 → x≡5y mod11.

So x=5y +11k for some integer k.

Now, let's substitute x=5y +11k into option A:7x +3y.

7*(5y +11k) +3y =35y +77k +3y =38y +77k.

Now, 38 mod11 is 38-33=5, 77 is 7*11, so 77k≡0 mod11. So 38y +77k ≡5y mod11. So 5y mod11. But from 3x +7y ≡0, and since x=5y mod11, substituting into 3x +7y: 3*(5y) +7y =15y +7y=22y≡0 mod11. That's consistent, but 5y mod11 is not necessarily zero. So option A:7x+3y ≡5y mod11, which isn't necessarily zero. So A isn't necessarily zero mod11.

Hmm, so maybe option A isn't the correct answer. Let me go to option B: x + y +5.

We have x=5y +11k. Let's compute x +y +5.

(5y +11k) + y +5 =6y +11k +5.

Now, 11k is 0 mod11, so 6y +5 mod11 must be zero. But from 3x +7y ≡0, and x=5y, let's plug into that equation: 3*(5y) +7y=15y+7y=22y≡0 mod11. So 22y is 0 mod11, which is always true. But 6y +5 mod11 must be zero. But from 3x +7y =0, and x=5y, so 22y=0 mod11, which is 0, but that doesn't tell us anything about y. So 6y +5 could be anything mod11. For example, if y=1, 6*1+5=11≡0 mod11. If y=2, 6*2+5=17≡6 mod11, which is not zero. So option B isn't necessarily zero mod11. So B is not guaranteed.

Option C:6x -2y.

Again, x=5y +11k. So 6*(5y +11k) -2y =30y +66k -2y =28y +66k.

28 mod11 is 28-22=6, 66 mod11 is 0. So 28y +66k =6y mod11. So 6y mod11. From 3x +7y=0, substitute x=5y: 3*(5y) +7y=15y+7y=22y≡0 mod11. So 22y=0 mod11. That doesn't tell us anything about y individually. So 6y mod11 could be anything. For example, y=1 →6 mod11, which isn't zero. So 6x -2y is not necessarily zero mod11. So C isn't correct.

Option D:8x +3y.

Again, x=5y +11k.

8*(5y +11k) +3y=40y +88k +3y=43y +88k.

43 mod11 is 43-33=10, 88 is 0 mod11. So 10y mod11.

From 3x +7y=0, with x=5y →22y=0 mod11, which is always true, but that doesn't give us info about y. So 10y mod11 can be any value. For example, y=1 →10 mod11 not zero. So D isn't necessarily zero.

Option E:4x +6y.

x=5y +11k. So 4*(5y +11k) +6y=20y +44k +6y=26y +44k.

26 mod11 is 4, 44 is 0 mod11. So 4y mod11.

Again, 4y mod11 can be anything. For example, y=1→4, y=2→8, y=3→12≡1, etc. So 4y mod11 is not necessarily zero. So E isn't necessarily zero.

Option F:5x +6y.

x=5y +11k. So 5*(5y +11k) +6y=25y +55k +6y=31y +55k.

31 mod11 is 9, 55 is 0 mod11. So 9y mod11.

So 9y mod11. Again, it's not necessarily zero. For example, y=1→9, y=2→18→7, etc. So F is not zero.

Option G:9x +4y.

x=5y +11k. So 9*(5y +11k) +4y=45y +99k +4y=49y +99k.

49 mod11 is 5, 99 is 0 mod11. So 5y mod11.

5y mod11. Again, not necessarily zero. For example, y=1→5, y=2→10, etc. So G is not necessarily zero.

Option H:4x -9y.

x=5y +11k. So 4*(5y +11k) -9y=20y +44k -9y=11y +44k.

11y is 0 mod11, and 44k is 0 mod11. So 0 mod11. So 4x -9y =0 mod11. So H is definitely divisible by 11.

Let me check the other options just to be sure. Option I:2x +5y.

x=5y +11k. So 2*(5y +11k) +5y=10y +22k +5y=15y +22k.

15 mod11 is 4, 22k is 0. So 4y mod11. As before, not necessarily zero.

So the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The correct answer is H: \(4x - 9y\). This is because substituting \(x = 5y + 11k\) into \(4x - 9y\) gives \(4(5y + 11k) - 9y = 20y + 44k - 9y = 11y\), which is divisible by 11. All other options do not necessarily satisfy the condition.

Answer: H
