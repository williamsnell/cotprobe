Question:

Wilshire Street is a public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Wilshire and Figueroa Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. A businessman was driving his car east on Figueroa Street and did not see the traffic light. He entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A woman, in violation of statute, was proceeding south on Wilshire Street, and she entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the businessman's car. The businessman suffered damages in the amount of $5,000. The woman, on the other hand, suffered damages in the amount of $1,000. The businessman brought suit against the woman to recover his damages. The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages. Both drivers were negligent with 30 percent of the negligence attributable to the woman and 70 percent of the negligence attributable to the businessman. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: "A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties. " Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?

Options:

A: The businessman recovers $1,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $900 from the businessman.
B: The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.
C: The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $300 from the businessman.
D: The businessman recovers $800 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.
E: The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.
F: The businessman recovers nothing from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.
G: The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.
H: The businessman recovers $2,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $500 from the businessman.
I: The businessman recovers $3,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $600 from the businessman.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law problem. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the setup is about a traffic accident involving two drivers. The businessman entered an intersection when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound. So, the light was red for eastbound, which means for him, that's a red light. He was on Figueroa Street, eastbound, so the light was red for him. He didn't see the light, I guess because he wasn't paying attention. 

Then, a woman was on Wilshire Street going south, and she entered the intersection without looking. She struck him. The businessman had damages of $5,000, and the woman had $1,000.

The question is about the negligence. The problem states that both drivers were negligent. The woman's negligence is 30% of their fault, and the businessman's is 70%. So, the woman was more negligent.

Looking at the statute: a failure to exercise ordinary care (FOCA) doesn't bar recovery, but damages are diminished. The FOCA is 30% of the total. So, the damages are reduced proportionally.

Wait, the way the problem is phrased: the woman was negligent by 30% and the businessman by 70%. So, the total negligence is 100%. So, the woman's proportion is 30%, and the businessman's is 70%.

So, the woman's damages would be reduced by her 30%, and the businessman's by his 70%. Or wait, no. The statute says that the injured party's damages are diminished. So, the woman is the one injured, so her damages are reduced by her proportion. The businessman's are also reduced, but by his proportion.

Wait, let me think again. The statute says: "A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured."

So, the injured party (woman) is the one who's negligent. So her damages are reduced by 30%. The other party (businessman) is also negligent, so his damages are reduced by 70%.

Wait, the problem says the woman's negligence is 30% of the woman's fault, and the businessman's is 70% of the man's. So, the woman's proportion is 30% of her fault, and the man's is 70% of his.

So, the woman's damages (originally $1,000) are reduced by 30%. 30% of 1,000 is 300, so her claim would be $1,000 - $300 = $700.

The man's damages are reduced by 70%. His original was $5,000. 70% of 5,000 is 3,500. So, his claim would be $5,000 - $3,500 = $1,500.

Wait, but let me make sure I got this right. The woman is the one injured, so her damages are reduced by 30% because she was negligent by 30%. The man's damages are reduced by his 70% because he was negligent by 70%.

So, when the woman is the one suing, her damages are reduced by 30%. So, $1,000 becomes $700. The man's damages are reduced by 70%, so $5,000 becomes $1,500.

Looking at the options:

Option H: businessman recovers $2,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $500 from the businessman. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Option D: businessman gets 800, woman gets 0. No, no.

Option B: businessman gets 5k, woman gets 1k. That's no.

Option A: man gets 1k from woman (which would be 1,000 * (70/100) = 700). Woman gets 900 (1k * 90%). So, A says the man gets 1k from the woman, which would be if the woman was the one scoring 70% (so man's damages are reduced by 70%). But the woman was negligent 30%, so her damages are reduced by 30%. So, the man's part would be 70% reduction, man's claim is $5k - 3,500 = $1,500. The woman's claim is $1k - 300 = $700.

So, the man gets 1,500 from the woman, and the woman gets 700 from the man. Looking at the options, none of them seem to match exactly, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: man gets 1k, woman gets 900.

B: man gets 5k, woman gets 1k.

C: man gets 3,500, woman gets 300.

D: man gets 800, woman gets 0.

E: man gets 5k, woman gets 0.

F: man gets 0, woman gets 1k.

G: man gets 1,500, woman gets 700.

H: man gets 2k, woman gets 500.

So, the correct numbers are man gets $1,500, woman gets $700. Which option is that? Option G.

But wait, looking again: The man's negligence is 70%, so the woman's damages are reduced by 30%. So, woman's claim is 700, man's is 1,500.

Wait, no—wait, the woman is the injured party. The statute says the damages are diminished by the proportion of negligence. So, the woman's damages are reduced by 30%, so 1k - 300 = 700. The man's damages are reduced by his 70%, so 5k - 3,500 = 1,500. So, the man gets 1,500, woman gets 700. Which is option G.

Looking at the options:

Option G: The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the woman's damages were $1,000, and the man's were $5,000. So, the woman's claim would be reduced by 30%, so 700. The man's would be reduced by 70%, so 1,500.

So, the man gets 1,500 back, the woman gets 700.

Looking at the options, G says the woman gets 1,500 from the man. Wait, no: option G says the man gets 1,500 from the woman, and the woman gets 700 from the man. Wait, no. Let me read the options correctly.

Wait, the options are about how much each party gets from the other. So, when the woman is suing, she's trying to recover her damages. The woman's claim is reduced by 30%, so she gets 700. The man's claim is reduced by 70%, so he gets 1,500.

So, in the answer, the man would get 1,500 from the woman, and the woman would get 700 from the man. But looking at the options, the only option that matches this is G. Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction.

Wait, no. The question asks: "The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages." So, the woman is suing the man. So, the man's claim is reduced by 70%, so the man gets 1,500.

The woman's claim is reduced by 30%, so she gets 700.

So the answer is the man gets 1,500 from the woman, and the woman gets 700 from the man. Looking at the options:

G says the man gets 1,500 from the woman, and the woman gets 700 from the man. So, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, G is: The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.

Wait, no, the woman is the injured party. So, when the woman is suing, she's trying to recover her damages. The man's claim would be reduced by 70%, so 5k - 3,500 = 1,500. The woman's claim would be reduced by 30%, so 1k - 300 = 700.

Therefore, the man gets 1,500 from the woman, and the woman gets 700 from the man. So, the option is G.

Looking at the options:

G says the man gets 1,500 from the woman, and the woman gets 700 from the man. So, answer G.

The problem involves a traffic accident where the woman, a non-negligent party, filed a counterclaim for her damages. The businessman, a negligent party, suffered damages as well. The statute states that a failure to exercise ordinary care (FOCA) reduces damages by the proportion of negligence attributable to the injured party. The woman was negligent by 30%, and the businessman by 70%.

1. **Woman's Damages**: Original damages were $1,000. Since her negligence was 30%, her damages are reduced by 30%:
   - Reduced amount = $1,000 × 30% = $300.
   - Thus, the woman's recovery is $700.

2. **Man's Damages**: Original damages were $5,000. Since his negligence was 70%, his damages are reduced by 70%:
   - Reduced amount = $5,000 × 70% = $3,500.
   - Thus, the man's recovery is $1,500.

3. **Correct Option**: The man recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the man.

**Answer: G**
