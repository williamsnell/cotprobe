Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the index of refraction for a glass with a dielectric constant of 2.5. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, right. The index of refraction, n, is related to the dielectric constant, κ, I think. Oh wait, the dielectric constant is the ratio of the absolute permittivity (ε) to the vacuum permittivity (ε0). So κ = ε/ε0. But wait, how does that connect to the index of refraction?

Oh right! The index of refraction for a medium is given by n = sqrt(ε_r), where ε_r is the relative permittivity, which is the same as the dielectric constant κ. Because I remember that n depends on the speed of light in the medium. The relation is n = c / v, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v in the medium. And the speed of light in the medium is c divided by the square root of ε_r. So when you take the ratio, n becomes sqrt(ε_r), which is the same as the dielectric constant here.

So in this case, the dielectric constant κ is 2.5. Therefore, the index of refraction n should be sqrt(2.5). Let me calculate that. The square root of 2.5—what's that approximately? Let me think, 1.5 squared is 2.25, 1.6 squared is 2.56. Oh wait, 2.5 is between 1.5² and 1.6². So sqrt(2.5) is about 1.5811. Hmm, looking at the options.

The options are... Let's see: Option F is 1.58, which is that value. So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the index of refraction for a glass with a dielectric constant of 2.5, we use the relationship between the dielectric constant (κ) and the index of refraction (n). The index of refraction is given by:

\[
n = \sqrt{\kappa}
\]

Substituting the given dielectric constant:

\[
n = \sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.5811
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value is **1.58**. Therefore, the correct answer is:
