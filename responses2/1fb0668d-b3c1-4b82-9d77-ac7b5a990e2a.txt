Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the energy dissipated in a resistor. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the current through the resistor is given by i(t) = cos²(π t). I remember that energy is the integral of power over time. Oh right, power is current squared times resistance. So P(t) = i(t)^2 * R.

Wait, the resistance is 2 ohms, right? So the power is (cos²(π t))² * 2. Let me write that down. So P(t) = 2 cos⁴(π t). Oh wait, cos squared squared is the same as cos to the fourth, so that's correct.

Now I need to integrate P(t) from t=0 to t=5 seconds. So energy E = ∫ (from 0 to 5) 2 cos⁴(π t) dt. Hmm, integrating cos to the fourth power. I remember there's a power-reduction formula for cos²x. Like cos²x = (1 + cos2x)/2. So maybe for cos⁴x, I can use that identity twice.

Let me try that. Let's express cos⁴(π t) as (cos²(π t))². Then, each cos² term can be written as (1 + cos(2π t))/2. So substituting, cos⁴(π t) = [(1 + cos(2π t))/2]^2.

Expanding that square: [ (1)^2 + 2*(1)*(cos(2πt))/2 + (cos(2πt))^2 ] / 4. Wait, wait, no. Wait, (a + b)^2 is a² + 2ab + b². So here, a is 1 and b is cos(2πt). So it becomes (1 + 2 cos(2πt) + cos²(2πt)) all over 4.

So cos⁴(π t) = (1 + 2 cos(2πt) + cos²(2πt)) /4. But now I have cos²(2πt) which I can apply the same identity again. So cos²(2πt) = (1 + cos(4πt))/2. Substituting back:

cos⁴(π t) = [1 + 2 cos(2πt) + (1 + cos(4πt))/2 ] /4.

Let me simplify that. Let me bring all terms over a common denominator of 2. So numerator becomes 2 + 4 cos(2πt) + 1 + cos(4πt), all over 2. So that's (3 + 4 cos(2πt) + cos(4πt)) / 2. So now, putting it back into the power equation.

So P(t) = 2 * [ (3 + 4 cos(2πt) + cos(4πt)) / 2 ] = (3 + 4 cos(2πt) + cos(4πt)).

Wait, because the 2 in front cancels the 2 in the denominator. So P(t) simplifies to 3 + 4 cos(2πt) + cos(4πt). That makes the integral easier.

So now, E = ∫ (from 0 to 5) [3 + 4 cos(2πt) + cos(4πt)] dt.

I can integrate term by term. Let's compute each part.

The integral of 3 dt from 0 to 5 is 3t evaluated from 0 to5, which is 15 -0 =15.

The integral of 4 cos(2πt) dt. The integral of cos(ax) dx is (1/a) sin(ax). So 4 * (1/(2π)) sin(2πt) evaluated from 0 to5. 

Similarly, the integral of cos(4πt) dt is (1/(4π)) sin(4πt). Evaluated from 0 to5.

Wait, let me compute each part.

So:

1. ∫3 dt from 0 to5 = 3*(5 -0) =15.

2. ∫4 cos(2πt) dt from 0 to5.

The integral is 4 * [ (1/(2π)) sin(2πt) ) ] evaluated from 0 to5.

So 4/(2π) [ sin(10π) - sin(0) ].

But sin(10π) is sin(0) because 10π is an integer multiple of 2π. So sin(10π) =0. Similarly, sin(0)=0. So this part is zero.

3. ∫cos(4πt) dt from 0 to5.

Integral is (1/(4π)) sin(4πt) evaluated from 0 to5.

Again, sin(4π*5)=sin(20π)=0, and sin(0)=0. So this part is zero.

So putting it all together: E =15 +0 +0 =15 J? Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 15 as an answer. Let me double-check.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the expansion of cos⁴(x)? Let's retrace.

Wait the earlier steps: P(t) = 2 * cos⁴(π t). Then I used cos² x = (1+cos(2x))/2, so cos⁴ x = [ (1+cos(2x))/2 ]². Which is (1 + 2 cos(2x) + cos²(2x)) /4.

Then, cos²(2x) = (1 + cos(4x))/2. So substituting that in:

(1 + 2 cos(2x) + (1 + cos(4x))/2 ) /4.

Now, let me recompute this. Let me do each term:

Numerator: 1 + 2 cos(2x) + (1 + cos(4x))/2.

Combine terms: let me write all terms over 2:

[2*(1) + 4 cos(2x) + 1 + cos(4x)] /2.

Wait no: 1 + 2 cos(2x) is (2 +4 cos(2x)) when multiplied by 2, and the third term is (1 + cos(4x))/2.

Wait perhaps a better approach: Let me find a common denominator.

1 can be written as 2/2, 2 cos(2x) as (4 cos(2x))/2, and the third term is (1 + cos(4x))/2.

Adding them up:

[2 +4 cos(2x) +1 + cos(4x)] / 2.

Which is [3 +4 cos(2x) + cos(4x)] /2.

So cos^4 x = [3 +4 cos(2x) + cos(4x)]/4.

Wait wait, no. Wait the earlier substitution: cos^4 x is [1 + 2 cos(2x) + (1 + cos(4x))/2 ] /4.

So to combine terms:

Multiply numerator: 1 * 2 =2, 2 cos(2x)*2=4 cos(2x), and (1 + cos(4x)) *1.

So numerator becomes 2 +4 cos(2x) +1 + cos(4x) =3 +4 cos(2x) + cos(4x).

So [3 +4 cos(2x) + cos(4x)] /4.

Wait, so cos^4 x = [3 +4 cos(2x) + cos(4x)] /4.

Putting back into P(t): 2 cos^4(π t) = 2 * [3 +4 cos(2π t) + cos(4 π t) ] /4.

Wait, because the x in cos is π t. So cos^4(π t) = [3 +4 cos(2 π t) + cos(4 π t)] /4.

So 2 * that is [3 +4 cos(2 π t) + cos(4 π t)] /2.

So P(t) = (3 +4 cos(2 π t) + cos(4 π t)) /2.

Therefore, the integral E is ∫0^5 P(t) dt = ∫0^5 [ (3 +4 cos(2 π t) + cos(4 π t) ) / 2 ] dt.

Which can be written as 1/2 ∫ (3 +4 cos(2 π t) + cos(4 π t)) dt.

So let's compute each part.

Integral of 3 dt from 0 to5 is 3*(5) =15.

Integral of 4 cos(2πt) dt: the integral is 4*(1/(2π)) sin(2πt) evaluated from 0 to5.

Which is [ 4/(2π) (sin(10π) - sin(0) ) ].

But sin(10π)=0 and sin(0)=0 → this part is zero.

Integral of cos(4πt) dt: the integral is (1/(4π)) sin(4πt) evaluated from 0 to5.

Again, sin(4π*5) = sin(20 π) =0, and sin(0)=0. So this part is zero.

So E = (1/2) [15 +0+0 ] =15/2 =7.5 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 7.50 J, so that's the correct answer.

But wait, did I make a mistake in the sign somewhere? Let me double-check the initial steps.

The current is i(t) = cos²(π t). So when squared, is it positive? Yes, because any real number squared is positive. So cos²(π t) is always between 0 and 1.

But wait, the power is i² R, which would be positive. So integrating a positive function makes sense.

Wait, but the way I expanded cos^4, I think I did everything correctly. So why in the options is the correct answer 7.5 J?

So the answer should be option B:7.50 J.

To calculate the energy dissipated in the resistor, we start by noting that the energy \( E \) is given by the integral of power over time: 

\[
E = \int_0^5 P(t) \, dt,
\]

where the power \( P(t) \) is related to the current \( i(t) \) by \( P(t) = i(t)^2 \cdot R \). Substituting \( i(t) = \cos^2(\pi t) \) and \( R = 2 \, \Omega \), we find:

\[
P(t) = 2 \cos^4(\pi t).
\]

To simplify \( \cos^4(\pi t) \), we use the power-reduction identity \( \cos^2(x) = \frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2} \). Applying this twice, we rewrite \( \cos^4(\pi t) \) as:

\[
\cos^4(\pi t) = \left( \frac{1 + \cos(2\pi t)}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\cos(2\pi t) + \cos^2(2\pi t)}{4}.
\]

Using the identity \( \cos^2(2\pi t) = \frac{1 + \cos(4\pi t)}{2} \), we substitute back:

\[
\cos^4(\pi t) = \frac{1 + 2\cos(2\pi t) + \frac{1 + \cos(4\pi t)}{2}}{4} = \frac{3 + 4\cos(2\pi t) + \cos(4\pi t)}{4}.
\]

Thus, the power becomes:

\[
P(t) = 2 \cos^4(\pi t) = \frac{3 + 4\cos(2\pi t) + \cos(4\pi t)}{2}.
\]

Now, the energy integral is:

\[
E = \int_0^5 P(t) \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^5 \left( 3 + 4\cos(2\pi t) + \cos(4\pi t) \right) dt.
\]

We compute each term separately:

1. **Integral of 3**:  
   \[
   \int_0^5 3 \, dt = 3t \Big|_0^5 = 15.
   \]

2. **Integral of \( 4\cos(2\pi t) \)**:  
   The integral of \( \cos(ax) \) is \( \frac{1}{a} \sin(ax) \).  
   \[
   \int_0^5 4\cos(2\pi t) \, dt = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2\pi} \sin(2\pi t) \Big|_0^5 = 0,
   \]
   since \( \sin(2\pi \cdot 5) = \sin(10\pi) = 0 \) and \( \sin(0) = 0 \).

3. **Integral of \( \cos(4\pi t) \)**:  
   Similarly,  
   \[
   \int_0^5 \cos(4\pi t) \, dt = \frac{1}{4\pi} \sin(4\pi t) \Big|_0^5 = 0,
   \]
   since \( \sin(4\pi \cdot 5) = \sin(20\pi) = 0 \) and \( \sin(0) = 0 \).

Putting it all together:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \left( 15 + 0 + 0 \right) = \frac{15}{2} = 7.50 \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the energy dissipated in the resistor is \( 7.50 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
