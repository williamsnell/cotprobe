Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Danbury Hat Company. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question is asking about the profit they make from selling 46,500 hats. Profit, right? I remember that profit is calculated by subtracting total costs from total revenue. So, I need to find out both the total revenue and the total costs, and then subtract them.

First, let's break down the given information. The company has fixed costs of $10,500. Fixed costs don't change with the number of units produced, so I don't have to worry about that when calculating variable costs. Variable costs are the costs that change with the number of units, which in this case is $1.50 per hat. The selling price per hat is $5.00. 

So, let me outline what I need to calculate:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling 46,500 hats.
2. Calculate the total variable costs for those same 46,500 hats.
3. Add the fixed costs to get the total costs.
4. Subtract the total costs from the total revenue to get the profit.

Let me start with the total revenue. Revenue is the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price per unit. So, that would be 46,500 hats * $5 per hat.

Hmm, 46,500 times 5. Let me compute that. 46,500 * 5 = 232,500. So, the total revenue is $232,500. 

Next, the total variable costs. Since each hat costs $1.50 to make, the cost for 46,500 hats is 46,500 * 1.50. Let me calculate that. 46,500 * 1.50. Well, 46,500 * 1 is 46,500, and 46,500 * 0.50 is 23,250. Adding those together, it's 46,500 +23,250 = 69,750. So, total variable costs are $69,750.

Now, adding the fixed costs to the total variable costs for the total costs. Fixed costs are $10,500, so total costs = $69,750 + $10,500. Let me add those. 69,750 +10,500 is 80,250. So, total costs are $80,250.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. No, no. Wait a second. Let me check that again. Fixed costs are $10,500, variable costs are $69,750. So, 10,500 +69,750 = 80,250. Yes that's correct.

So, total revenue is $232,500, total costs are $80,250. Profit is revenue minus costs, so 232,500 -80,250.

Let me do that subtraction. 232,500 minus 80,250. 232,500 minus 80,000 is 152,500. Then subtract the remaining 250, so 152,500 -250 =152,250.

Wait, that's $152,250. Looking at the options, option A is $152,250. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total revenue: 46,500 *5 = 232,500. Yes, correct.

Variable cost per hat is 1.50, so 46,500 *1.50. Let me compute 46,500 *1.50. Alternatively, 46,500 * (3/2) = 46,500 *1.5.

Alternatively, 46,500 * 1 is 46,500. 46,500 *0.5 is 23,250. Sum is 69,750. So that's correct.

Fixed costs are 10,500. So total costs 69,750 +10,500 =80,250. Correct.

Profit is 232,500 -80,250. Let me compute that again. 232,500 minus 80,250. 80,250 is 80k +250. 232,500 minus 80k is 152,500. 152,500 minus 250 is 152,250. Yes.

Looking at the options, option A is $152,250. So that's the correct answer.

The Danbury Hat Company's profit is calculated by subtracting total costs from total revenue. 

1. **Total Revenue**: 46,500 hats * $5 = $232,500.
2. **Total Variable Costs**: 46,500 hats * $1.50 = $69,750.
3. **Total Costs**: Fixed costs ($10,500) + Variable costs ($69,750) = $80,250.
4. **Profit**: $232,500 - $80,250 = $152,250.

The correct answer is **A: $152,250**.
