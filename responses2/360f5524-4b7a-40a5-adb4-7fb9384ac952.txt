Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the limit as n approaches infinity of the expression (2/√π) multiplied by the square root of n times the integral from 0 to 1 of (1 - x²)^n dx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these integrals, but I think I remember something about approximating them for large exponents.

Let me think. When n is very large, the function (1 - x²)^n is going to be significant only when x is close to 1 because as x approaches 1, 1 - x² becomes small but raised to a large power. So maybe the integral is dominated by the region near x=1.

Wait, but substitution might help here. Let's try a substitution. Let me set t = x². Then x = sqrt(t), and dx = (1/(2√t)) dt. Let me try that.

So the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of (1 - t)^n * (1/(2√t)) dt. That looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can make another substitution to simplify it further. Maybe set t = sin²θ, so that 1 - t becomes cos²θ. Let's see.

Wait, let's try a substitution that centers around the peak of the integrand. When n is large, (1 - x²)^n is sharply peaked near x=1. So perhaps a substitution like x = 1 - y², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe expand (1 - x²)^n for large n.

Wait, another approach: using Laplace's method or the method of steepest descent for integrals. But I might not remember all the details. Alternatively, I know that integrals of the form ∫ e^{-n f(x)} dx for large n can be approximated by looking for the minimum of f(x).

Wait, let me try a substitution. Let me let x = 1 - z^{1/(2n)}. Hmm, but perhaps a better substitution is to make x = 1 - y/(n^α) for some exponent α to be determined. Let me see.

Alternatively, let me make a substitution so that the integral becomes something like ∫ e^{-n g(y)} dy, and then approximate it. Let me set x = 1 - y, so that when x approaches 1, y approaches 0. But that might not capture the correct scaling.

Wait, another idea: let me perform substitution to make the integrand look like a Gaussian. Let me set y = (1 - x²), so dy = -2x dx. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps a better substitution. Let me set x = 1 - t^{2m}, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, let me consider expanding (1 - x²)^n for large n. Using the approximation that for x near 1, (1 - x²)^n ≈ e^{-n(2x - 1)}, since the maximum occurs at x=1, but perhaps a better approach is to use the exponential expansion.

Wait, I think I remember that for large n, ∫ (1 - x²)^n dx from 0 to 1 can be approximated using the method of Laplace. Let me try that.

The function f(x) = (1 - x²)^n. The maximum occurs at x=1, but to approximate the integral, we can expand around that point. Let me make a substitution t = 1 - x, so x = 1 - t, and t goes from 0 to 1 as x goes from 1 to 0.

But perhaps a more precise substitution is needed. Let me set x = 1 - z/(n^α), where α is a parameter to be determined. Then, for large n, z will be small.

Wait, let's try x = 1 - z^{2n}, but that might not be the right substitution. Alternatively, perhaps I should let x = 1 - y^2, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to substitute x = 1 - e^{-y} for some y. When x is near 1, y would be near 0. Let me try that.

Let x = 1 - e^{-y}, so dx = e^{-y} dy. Then when x =1, y=0; when x=0, y approaches infinity, but the integrand (1-x²)^n becomes (x²)^n because 1 - x² = x² when x is near 1. So (1-x²)^n = x^{2n} = (1 - e^{-y})^{2n}.

Hmm, but (1 - e^{-y}) is approximately e^{-y} for small y, so (1 - e^{-y})^{2n} ≈ e^{-2n y}. So the integral becomes ∫ from y=0 to y=∞ of e^{-2n y} * e^{-y} dy, because dx = e^{-y} dy.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the substitution. Let me check again. x = 1 - e^{-y}, so dx = e^{-y} dy. Then, when x approaches 1, y approaches 0; when x approaches 0, y approaches infinity. But substituting into the integral ∫ (1 - x²)^n dx, we get ∫ [x^2]^n dx = [1 - e^{-y}]^{2n} * e^{-y} dy.

But [1 - e^{-y}]^{2n} ≈ (e^{-y})^{2n} = e^{-2n y} when y is small. So for large n, the integrand is significant only when y is small, so we can approximate [1 - e^{-y}]^{2n} ≈ e^{-2n y}.

So the integral ∫ e^{-2n y} * e^{-y} dy from 0 to ∞. That simplifies to ∫ e^{-(2n + 1)y} dy, which is 1/(2n + 1). But wait, that's just for the substitution as x approaches 1, but I'm not sure if this is the correct substitution.

Wait, perhaps another substitution would be better. Let me think about this again. Maybe I should use a substitution where the integrand becomes a Gaussian integral.

Alternatively, perhaps a substitution like x = sin(z), but I'm not sure. Let me try to make a substitution that centers the peak.

Wait, another approach: expand (1 - x²)^n for x near 1. Let me set x = 1 - y, so when x approaches 1, y approaches 0. Then, 1 - x² = 1 - (1 - y)^2 = 1 - (1 - 2y + y²) = 2y - y² ≈ 2y for small y.

So (1 - x²)^n ≈ (2y)^n, which is (2)^n y^n.

So the integral becomes ∫ (0 to 1) (1 - x²)^n dx ≈ ∫ (0 to 1) (2y)^n (dy), but wait, that would be [2y]^n dy from 0 to 1, which is ∫ 2^n y^n dy from 0 to 1. That's 2^n ∫ y^n dy from 0 to 1, which is 2^n * [1/(n + 1)].

But wait, that can't be right because then the integral would be proportional to 2^n / (n+1), which grows exponentially as n increases, but we're multiplying by sqrt(n)/sqrt(pi) and then by 2/sqrt(pi). Wait, perhaps this approach isn't correct because the substitution x = 1 - y only works when y is small, but perhaps I should consider the substitution x = 1 - e^{-y} as I did earlier.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. When x approaches 1, y approaches 0, so perhaps the substitution x = 1 - e^{-y} is better. Then, the integral becomes ∫ (1 - x²)^n dx ≈ ∫ (2y)^n e^{-y} dy from 0 to ∞, right? Because when x approaches 1, y approaches 0, and dx = e^{-y} dy.

Wait, substituting x = 1 - e^{-y}, then 1 - x² = (1 - e^{-y})² ≈ (e^{-y})² (since e^{-y} is small), so (1 - x²)^n ≈ e^{-2n y}. So the integral becomes ∫ e^{-2n y} e^{-y} dy from 0 to ∞. This is ∫ e^{-(2n + 1)y} dy = 1/(2n + 1) ≈ 1/(2n) for large n.

Wait, but that gives the integral as approximately 1/(2n). Then, the expression in the question would be (2/√π) * sqrt(n) * (1/(2n)) ) ≈ (2/√π) * (sqrt(n) ) * (1/(2n)) ) = (2/√π) * (1/(2 sqrt(n)) )) = 1/(sqrt(pi) * sqrt(n)).

Wait, but that would go to zero as n approaches infinity, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, that's confusing because the options are finite numbers except for I:1.0, but I got zero, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Let me go back through the substitution steps more carefully.

Wait, when I set x = 1 - e^{-y}, then dx = e^{-y} dy.

Then 1 - x² = 1 - (1 - e^{-y})² = 1 - (1 - 2 e^{-y} + e^{-2y}) ) = 2 e^{-y} - e^{-2y} ≈ 2 e^{-y} for small y.

So (1 - x²)^n ≈ (2 e^{-y})^n = 2^n e^{-n y}.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - x²)^n dx ≈ ∫ 2^n e^{-n y} e^{-y} dy = 2^n ∫ e^{-(n + 1)y} dy from 0 to ∞.

Which is 2^n * [1/(n + 1)] ≈ 2^n / (n + 1) ≈ 2^n / n for large n.

Wait, but that's exponential over n, which would make the expression (2/√π) * sqrt(n) * (2^n /n ) which would be (2/√pi) * 2^n * sqrt(n) / n = (2/√pi) * 2^n * (1/ sqrt(n)).

Wait, but that would go to infinity as n increases, which again isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the substitution approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different substitution. Let me try the substitution t = x^2. Then, dt = 2x dx, so dx = dt/(2 sqrt(t)).

The integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to 1 of (1 - t)^n * (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt.

Hmm, but this seems like a Beta function integral. The integral of t^{k-1} (1 - t)^{m-1} dt from 0 to1 is B(k, m) = Γ(k)Γ(m)/Γ(k+m).

In this case, ∫ t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^n dt from 0 to1 is B(1/2, n+1) = Γ(1/2) Γ(n+1) / Γ(n + 3/2).

We know Γ(1/2) is sqrt(pi), and Γ(n+1) is n! ; Γ(n + 3/2) is (n + 1/2) Γ(n + 1/2) = (n + 1/2)(n - 1/2)... (1/2) sqrt(pi).

So Γ(n + 3/2) = (sqrt(pi) (n + 1/2)! )) / (2^{n} n! )) Hmm, perhaps I should express it in terms of factorials. Alternatively, perhaps using an approximation for large n.

Wait, but perhaps an easier approach. The Beta function Γ(1/2, n+1) is equal to sqrt(pi) * n! / ( (n + 1/2)! ) ).

So, the integral ∫ t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^n dt = sqrt(pi) n! / (n + 1/2)! )

Wait, but for large n, the ratio of these factorials can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Stirling's approximation for large m is m! ≈ sqrt(2 pi m) (m/e)^m.

So, let's compute the ratio:

n! / (n + 1/2)! ≈ [sqrt(2 pi n) (n/e)^n ] / [ sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2)) ( (n + 1/2)/e )^{n + 1/2} } ]

Simplify this: sqrt(2 pi n) / sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2)) ) * (n^n)/( (n + 1/2)^{n + 1/2} } ) * e^{-n} e^{-1/2}.

The sqrt(2 pi n) / sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2)) ) simplifies to sqrt( (n) / (n + 1/2) ) = sqrt(1 - 1/(2n +1)) ≈ 1 - 1/(4n). For large n, this is approximately 1.

The (n^n)/( (n + 1/2)^{n + 1/2} ) can be written as [n / (n + 1/2)]^n * 1 / sqrt(n + 1/2).

n / (n + 1/2) = 1 / (1 + 1/(2n)) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n) for large n.

So [n / (n + 1/2)]^n ≈ e^{-n/(2n)} = e^{-1/2}.

So the ratio becomes: (1) * e^{-1/2} * (1/sqrt(n + 1/2)) ) * e^{-n} e^{-1/2}.

Wait, no, let me re-express:

Wait, the exponentials:

e^{-n} * e^{-1/2} from the denominator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recheck:

The term is (n^n)/( (n + 1/2)^{n + 1/2} } ) = [n/(n + 1/2)]^n * 1/(n + 1/2)^{1/2}.

Which is [n/(n + 1/2)]^n * 1/sqrt(n + 1/2}.

As n is large, n/(n + 1/2) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n). So [n/(n+1/2)]^n ≈ e^{-1/2}.

And 1/sqrt(n + 1/2) ≈ 1/sqrt(n).

Putting it all together:

sqrt(2 pi n)/(sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2))) ) * e^{-n} e^{-1/2} * 1/sqrt(n + 1/2) 

Wait, maybe I should use an approximation for the factorial ratio.

Another approach: using the relation Γ(n + 1/2) ≈ (sqrt(pi) (2n)! )/(4^n n! ) ) ?

Wait, no, perhaps using the exact relation.

The ratio n!/(n + 1/2)! = 1/( (n + 1/2)(n + 3/2)...(3/2) ) 

Wait, but that seems complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me use the approximation for the Beta function for large n. The integral ∫ t^{c-1} (1-t)^{d-1} dt from 0 to1 is B(c, d) ≈ Gamma(c) Gamma(d)/ Gamma(c+d) for large c and d.

In our case, the integral is ∫ t^{-1/2} (1-t)^n dt, which is B(1/2, n+1).

So B(1/2, n+1) = Γ(1/2) Γ(n+1) / Γ(n+3/2).

We can write Γ(n+3/2) = (n + 1/2) Γ(n+1/2), which is equal to (n + 1/2)(n - 1/2)...(1/2) sqrt(pi).

But using Stirling's approximation for large n, we can approximate Γ(n + 3/2) ≈ sqrt(2 pi (n + 3/2)) (n + 3/2)^{n + 1/2} e^{-(n + 3/2)}.

Similarly, Γ(n+1) ≈ sqrt(2 pi n) (n)^{n + 1/2} e^{-n}.

So putting it together:

Γ(1/2) Γ(n +1 ) / Γ(n + 3/2) ≈ [sqrt(pi) * sqrt(2 pi n) (n)^{n + 1/2} e^{-n} ] / [ sqrt(2 pi (n + 3/2)) (n + 3/2)^{n + 1/2} e^{-(n + 3/2)} } ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: sqrt(pi) * sqrt(2 pi n) * n^{n + 1/2} e^{-n}.

Denominator: sqrt(2 pi (n + 3/2)) * (n + 3/2)^{n + 1/2} e^{-n - 3/2}.

So the ratio is:

[ sqrt(pi) * sqrt(2 pi n) * n^{n + 1/2} e^{-n} ] / [ sqrt(2 pi (n + 3/2)) * (n + 3/2)^{n + 1/2} e^{-n - 3/2} ].

Simplify each part:

sqrt(pi) / sqrt(2 pi (n + 3/2)) ) = sqrt(pi) / [ sqrt(2 pi) sqrt(n + 3/2) ) ] = 1 / sqrt(2 (n + 3/2)) ).

The sqrt(2 pi n) in the numerator divided by sqrt(2 pi) in the denominator: sqrt(2 pi n) / sqrt(2 pi) )= sqrt(n).

n^{n + 1/2} / (n + 3/2)^{n + 1/2} ) ≈ [n / (n + 3/2)]^{n + 1/2} }.

And [n/(n + 3/2)]^{n + 1/2} = [1/(1 + 3/(2n))]^{n + 1/2} ≈ e^{-3/2}.

Because (1 + a/n)^n ≈ e^{a} for large n, so (1 + 3/(2n))^{n} ≈ e^{3/2}.

Thus, [1/(1 + 3/(2n))]^{n + 1/2} ≈ e^{-3/2}.

Putting it all together:

Ratio ≈ [1 / sqrt(2 (n + 3/2)) ) ] * [1 / sqrt(n) ) ] * e^{-3/2}.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the terms again. Let me go step by step.

The ratio sqrt(pi) / sqrt(2 pi (n + 3/2)) ) is 1 / sqrt(2 (n + 3/2)) ).

The sqrt(2 pi n) / sqrt(2 pi) is sqrt(n).

n^{n + 1/2} / (n + 3/2)^{n + 1/2} ≈ e^{-3/2}.

And e^{-n} / e^{-n - 3/2} = e^{3/2}.

Putting all the pieces together:

The ratio is [1 / sqrt(2 (n + 3/2)) ) ] * [1 / sqrt(n) ) ] * e^{-3/2} * e^{3/2}.

The e^{-3/2} and e^{3/2} terms multiply to e^0 =1.

So the ratio is [1 / sqrt(2 (n + 3/2)) ) ] * [1 / sqrt(n) ) ].

So sqrt(2 (n + 3/2)) * sqrt(n) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(n(n + 3/2)).

Wait, perhaps I should factor n(n + 3/2) as n^2 + (3/2) n.

But for large n, n^2 + (3/2) n ≈ n^2 (1 + 3/(2n)) ≈ n^2 e^{3/(2n)}.

So sqrt(n^2 e^{3/(2n)}) ) = n e^{3/(4n)} ≈ n (1 + 3/(4n)).

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's try to combine the terms.

The ratio becomes [1 / sqrt(2(n + 3/2)) )] * [1 / sqrt(n) ) ] = 1 / [ sqrt(2) * sqrt(n) * sqrt(n + 3/2) ) ].

Wait, maybe I can express sqrt(n) * sqrt(n + 3/2) ) = sqrt(n(n + 3/2)) ).

But that's sqrt(n^2 + (3/2) n) ) ≈ sqrt(n^2 + 3n/2) ) ≈ n sqrt(1 + 3/(2n)) ) ≈ n (1 + 3/(4n)) ) ≈ n + 3/(4).

Hmm, I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for large n, B(1/2, n+1) ≈ sqrt( pi ) * n! / ( (n+1/2)! ) ).

But from Stirling's formula, n! ≈ sqrt(2 pi n) (n/e)^n, and (n + 1/2)! ≈ sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2)) (n + 1/(2 e))^{n + 1/2} }.

So the ratio becomes:

sqrt(pi) * sqrt(2 pi n) (n/e)^n / ( sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2)) ) (n + 1/(2 e))^{n + 1/2} } )

Simplify the terms:

sqrt(pi) / sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2)) ) = 1 / sqrt(2 (n + 1/2)) ).

sqrt(2 pi n) / sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2)) ) = sqrt( n / (n + 1/2) ) ≈ 1 - 1/(4n) for large n.

The (n/e)^n / (n + 1/(2 e))^{n + 1/2} ) term.

Expressed as [n/(n + 1/(2 e)))]^n * e^{-1/(2 e)}.

n/(n + 1/(2 e)) ) ≈ 1 - 1/(2 e n).

So [1 - 1/(2 e n)]^n ≈ e^{-1/(2 e)}.

So putting it all together:

sqrt(pi) * sqrt(2 pi n) (n/e)^n / ( sqrt(2 pi (n + 1/2)) (n + 1/(2 e))^{n + 1/2} )) ) ≈ [1 / sqrt(2 (n + 1/2)) ) ] * [1 - 1/(4n) ) ] * [1 - 1/(2 e)]^n * e^{-1/(2 e)}.

Wait, but this seems too complicated. Let me instead consider that the ratio Γ(n + 1/2) / Γ(n + 1) ≈ (sqrt(pi) (n + 1/2)! )) / (4^n (n + 1/2)^n e^{-n}) ), but perhaps it's better to accept that the integral ∫ t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^n dt ≈ 2^n / (n + 1) for large n.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the integral is approximately 2^n / n for large n.

So the expression in the question is (2/√pi) * sqrt(n) * (2^n /n) ).

Hmm, that's (2/√pi) * (sqrt(n) * 2^n ) / n ) = (2/√pi) * 2^n * sqrt(n) / n.

Simplify sqrt(n) / n = 1/sqrt(n).

So the expression becomes (2/√pi) * (2^n) * (1/sqrt(n)).

As n approaches infinity, 2^n grows exponentially, making the entire expression go to infinity. But none of the options except I:1.0 are present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different substitution. Let me try x = sinθ, but I'm not sure that would help. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: consider the substitution t = x^2, then the integral becomes ∫ (1 - t)^n (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt. Which is ∫ (1 - t)^n (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt from t=0 to t=1.

Wait, but this seems similar to the earlier substitution. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the substitution x = 1 - y^2, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the substitution t = x^2, so x = sqrt(t), dx = (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt.

So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - t)^n (1/(2 sqrt(t))) dt from t=0 to t=1.

Wait, but that brings me back to the same substitution as before, which didn't seem to work.

Wait, maybe I should instead use the substitution t = x, and see what happens. No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the substitution t = 1 - x, so x = 1 - t, dx = -dt. Then, the integral becomes ∫ (t)^n (1/(2 sqrt(1 - t))) dt from t=1 to t=0.

But integrating from 1 to 0, perhaps I can reverse the limits and add a negative sign, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I should express the integral in terms of the Beta function. Let me try that.

So, the integral ∫ (1 - x)^n dx from 0 to 1 is equal to Beta(1, n+1) = Γ(1)Γ(n+1)/Γ(n+2) = 1 * n! / (n+1)! ) = 1/(n+1).

So the integral ∫ (1 - x)^n dx = 1/(n+1).

Hmm, but wait, that's not correct because the integral of (1 - x)^n dx from 0 to 1 is 1/(n+1).

Wait, but that's for the integral without any x terms. But in our case, the integral is ∫ (1 - x^2)^n dx from 0 to1.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the integral using substitution.

Wait, perhaps I can make the substitution u = x^2, so x = sqrt(u), and dx = (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du.

So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - u)^n (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du from u=0 to u=1.

Hmm, but that's the same as before.

So, the integral is ∫ (1 - u)^n (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du from 0 to1.

Hmm, perhaps I can approximate this integral for large n.

Wait, considering that the integrand is peaked around u=0, and the function (1 - u)^n is sharply peaked at u=0 for large n.

So, for large n, the integral ∫ (1 - u)^n (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du ≈ (1/(2 sqrt(u))) evaluated at u=0 times the integral of (1 - u)^n du from 0 to1.

Wait, but the integral of (1 - u)^n du from 0 to1 is 1/(n+1).

So, the integral becomes approximately (1/(2 sqrt(0))) * 1/(n+1), which is undefined, but perhaps the approximation is better.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation for the integral of (1 - u)^n (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du.

Wait, perhaps I can use the substitution t = u, and express the integral in terms of the Beta function.

Wait, no, because the substitution t = u doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use an integration by parts.

Let me consider integrating by parts. Let me set v = 1/(2 sqrt(u)), dv = (-1)/(4 u^{3/2} ) du.

Let me set dw = (1 - u)^n du, w = ∫ (1 - u)^n du from 0 to u.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed differently.

Wait, perhaps I should approximate the integral using Laplace's method.

Laplace's method approximates integrals of the form ∫ e^{n f(x)} g(x) dx. For large n, the integral is dominated by the maximum of f(x).

In our case, the integral is ∫ (1 - u)^n (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du.

So, we can write (1 - u)^n = e^{n ln(1 - u)}.

But ln(1 - u) ≈ -u - u^2/2 - u^3/3 - ... for small u.

So, ln(1 - u) ≈ -u for small u.

Thus, (1 - u)^n ≈ e^{-n u}.

So, the integrand becomes e^{-n u} * (1/(2 sqrt(u))).

Now, the function e^{-n u} is peaked at u=0. So, the main contribution to the integral comes from u near 0.

Thus, for Laplace's method, the integral is dominated by the behavior near u=0.

So, we can approximate the integral as ∫_{0}^{\infty} e^{-n u} * (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du.

But this is an improper integral, so we can extend the upper limit to ∞ without changing the value.

Now, we can compute this integral.

Let me make a substitution t = n u, so u = t/n, du = dt/n.

So, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{\infty} e^{-t} * (1/(2 sqrt(t/n))) ) * (dt/n).

Simplify the terms:

sqrt(t/n) = sqrt(t)/sqrt(n).

So, 1/sqrt(t/n) )= sqrt(n)/sqrt(t).

Thus, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{\infty} e^{-t} (sqrt(n)/sqrt(t)) ) (dt/n).

Which is sqrt(n) / n ∫_{0}^{\infty} e^{-t} / sqrt(t) dt.

The integral ∫_{0}^{\infty} e^{-t} / sqrt(t) dt is a standard integral.

It equals sqrt(pi) * 2^{1/2} } ? Wait, no, I think it's equal to Gamma(1/2) sqrt(pi) )? Wait, no, Gamma(1/2) is sqrt(pi). So, ∫ e^{-t} / sqrt(t) dt from 0 to ∞ is Gamma(1/2) sqrt(pi) )? No, wait, Gamma(1/2) is sqrt(pi), so perhaps the integral is sqrt(pi) * 2^{1/2} }? No, perhaps I'm confusing it.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that ∫_{0}^{\infty} t^{c-1} e^{-t} dt = Γ(c).

So, for c = 1/2, ∫ t^{-1/2} e^{-t} dt from 0 to ∞ is Γ(1/2) = sqrt(pi).

Wait, but that's not matching with my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting.

Wait, ∫ e^{-t} / sqrt(t) dt from 0 to ∞ is equal to Γ(1/2) = sqrt(pi).

So, in that case, the integral becomes sqrt(n)/n * sqrt(pi).

Thus, the integral ∫ (1 - u)^n (1/(2 sqrt(u))) du ≈ sqrt(n)/n * sqrt(pi) = sqrt(pi n) / n.

Which is sqrt(pi) / sqrt(n).

So, the integral is approximately sqrt(pi) / sqrt(n).

Thus, the expression in the question is (2/√pi) * sqrt(n) * (sqrt(pi) / sqrt(n)).

Which simplifies to (2/√pi) * sqrt(n) * sqrt(pi) / sqrt(n) = (2/√pi) * sqrt(pi) = 2.

So, the limit is 2.

Wait, but none of the options are 2. The options are A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4.

Wait, so the correct answer should be B:2.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the integral was sqrt(pi) / sqrt(n). So, that gives the expression as 2.
