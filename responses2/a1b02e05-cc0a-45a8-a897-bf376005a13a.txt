Okay, so I've got this line integral problem to solve. It's a bit tricky, but let's see how to approach it. The problem asks me to compute two line integrals: the integral of xy dx along a straight line K from (0,0) to (1,1), and another along a parabola L from the same points. Then, I need to return the answers as a list. The options are A to J, each with specific values.

First, I need to remember how to compute a line integral. A line integral of a scalar function like xy dx along a curve K can be computed by parameterizing the curve and integrating. So, for each integral, I have to parameterize the path, express x and y in terms of a parameter, and then set up the integral.

Let me start with the straight line K from (0,0) to (1,1). For a straight line, I can parameterize it using a parameter t, where t goes from 0 to 1. So, x(t) = t and y(t) = t. Because when t=0, we're at (0,0), and when t=1, we're at (1,1). That makes sense.

Now, the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [xy dx]. Substituting, x is t, y is t, and dx is the derivative of x with respect to t multiplied by dt. So, dx = dt. So, the integral becomes ∫ (t * t) * (dt) from 0 to 1. That simplifies to ∫ t² dt from 0 to 1.

I can compute that integral. The antiderivative of t² is (t³)/3. Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives (1³/3) - (0) = 1/3, which is approximately 0.333333...

So, the first integral ∫K xy dx is 1/3, which is approximately 0.333.

Now, for the second integral along the parabola L: y = x² from (0,0) to (1,1). Again, I'll parameterize with a parameter t from 0 to 1. Let's let x(t) = t, then y(t) = t². Because when t=0, x=0 and y=0, and when t=1, x=1 and y=1. Perfect.

The integral is the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [xy dx]. Substituting, x is t, y is t², and dx is dt (since dx/dt = 1). So, the integral becomes ∫ (t * t²) * (dt) from 0 to 1. That's ∫ t^3 dt from 0 to 1.

The antiderivative of t^3 is t^4/4. Evaluating from 0 to 1 gives (1^4/4) - (0) = 1/4 = 0.25.

So, the integral ∫L xy dx is 0.25.

Now, I need to compare these results with the options given. The options are A to J, each with two numbers. Looking at option F: [0.25, 0.333]. Wait, no: option C is [0.4,0.3], and option F is [0.25, 0.333]. Hmm. Wait, the first integral is 1/3 ≈ 0.333, the second is 0.25.

Looking at the options, option F is [0.25, 0.333], which matches 0.25 and 1/3. So the answer would be F.

Wait, let me double-check the math because sometimes I might mix up the limits or the substitution. Let me recompute.

For K: x(t)=t, y(t)=t. dx/dt=1, so dx=dt. Integral is ∫t * t * dt from 0 to1 → ∫t² dt → [t³/3] from 0 to1 → 1/3.

For L: x(t)=t, y(t)=t². dx/dt=1, so dx=dt. Integral is ∫t * t² dt → ∫t³ dt → [t^4/4] from 0 to 1 → 1/4.

So the values are 1/3 (~0.333) and 1/4 (0.25). So the correct option is F: [0.25, 0.333].

The line integrals are computed by parameterizing each curve and integrating over the parameter.

For the straight line K:
- Parameterize as \( x(t) = t \), \( y(t) = t \), with \( t \) from 0 to 1.
- Integral becomes \( \int_0^1 t^2 \, dt \), which evaluates to \( \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333 \).

For the parabola L:
- Parameterize as \( x(t) = t \), \( y(t) = t^2 \), with \( t \) from 0 to 1.
- Integral becomes \( \int_0^1 t^3 \, dt \), which evaluates to \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \).

The results are \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \), corresponding to option F: [0.25, 0.333].
