Okay, so I've got this limit problem here, and I need to find the value of c for which the limit exists. The expression is the limit as x approaches c of (x² -5x -6)/(x -c). Hmm, I remember that for a limit to exist when x approaches a certain value, the function doesn't have any jumps or undefined points there. So, maybe I should start by checking if the function is defined at x = c.

Wait, but the denominator is (x - c), which would be zero if x is equal to c. So, if I plug x = c into the denominator, I get zero, which would make the expression undefined. That's a problem because if the denominator is zero and the numerator isn't, the function is undefined at x = c, so the limit might not exist. But maybe if the numerator also has a factor of (x - c), then the function can be simplified, and the limit might exist.

Let me try factoring the numerator: x² -5x -6. I need two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to -5. Let's see, 1 and -6. 1 * (-6) = -6, and 1 + (-6) = -5. Yes, that works. So, the numerator factors into (x + 1)(x -6). So, the expression becomes ((x +1)(x -6))/(x -c). 

Wait, but the denominator is (x -c), and the numerator is (x +1)(x -6). So, for the (x -c) term to cancel out, (x -c) must be a factor of the numerator. That would require that (x -c) is either (x +1) or (x -6). So, setting (x -c) = (x +1) gives c = -1. Or, (x -c) = (x -6) gives c =6. So, if c is either -1 or 6, then the (x -c) term can be canceled out, and the function simplifies to (x +1)(x -6)/(x -c) but since the (x -c) terms cancel, it just becomes (x +1)(x -6)/(x -c) → (x +1)(x -6)/(x -c), but if c is 6, then the denominator becomes (x -6), so the (x -6) cancels, and the limit as x approaches 6 of (x+1)(x-6)/(x-6) is just (x+1), which approaches 7. Similarly, if c is -1, then the limit is (x +1)(x -6)/(x -(-1)) → (x+1)(x-6)/(x+1), which simplifies to (x-6), and as x approaches -1, the limit is (-1-6) = -7.

Wait, but wait a second, does that mean that the limit exists? Because when c is either -1 or 6, the function can be simplified, and the limit exists at those points. But what about other values of c?

If c is not -1 or 6, then the denominator (x -c) doesn't cancel with the numerator, so the function would approach infinity or negative infinity, depending on the approach. For example, if c is 0, then the limit would be (0^2 -5*0 -6)/(0 -0) which is -6/0, which is undefined. Similarly, for other c values, the function may not have a finite limit.

But wait, the question says that the limit exists. So, when does the limit exist? It exists when the function approaches the same finite value from both sides, or when the function doesn't approach infinity. So, for the limit to exist at c, the function must approach a finite value.

So, only when c is such that the denominator cancels with a factor in the numerator, leading to a removable discontinuity. So, the possible c values are when (x -c) is a factor of the numerator. So, as we found, c can be -1 or 6.

Now, looking at the options, the options are the intervals given. Let me check the options again:

A: [0,5]
B: [2,8]
C: [1,7]
D: [3,9]
E: [1,5]
F: [-3,3]
G: [-4,2]
H: [0,6]
I: [-2,4]
J: [-1,6]

So, the possible c values are -1 and 6. But looking at the options, only option H is [0,6], which includes 6 but not -1. Option G is [-4,2], which doesn't include 6. Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, the options for c are given as intervals. So, which of these intervals includes either -1 or 6. Looking at the options:

H: [0,6] includes 6, but not -1.
J: [-1,6] includes both -1 and 6.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the question is about what is the value of c. Oh, wait, no. Wait, no, the question is about which of the options A to J is the correct c value where the limit exists. So, the correct c's are -1 and 6. But the options are intervals. So the correct interval that includes either of these numbers would be J: [-1,6], which includes both -1 and 6. So, the answer is J.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because if the limit exists at c, then c must be such that the function can be simplified, leading to a removable discontinuity. So, only when c is -1 or 6. But the options are intervals. So, which of the options contains both -1 and 6? Let me see:

Option J is [-1,6], which includes both points. So, the answer is J.
</think>

The limit exists only when the denominator cancels out a factor in the numerator, leading to a removable discontinuity. Factoring the numerator gives (x + 1)(x - 6), so the function simplifies to (x + 1)(x - 6)/(x - c). For the (x - c) term to cancel, c must be -1 or 6. Among the options, only J: [-1,6] includes both -1 and 6, making it the correct choice.

Answer: J
