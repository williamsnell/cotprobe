Okay, so I've got this law question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a buyer who agreed to sell a used car for $10,000. On the day of the sale, the buyer gives a $10,000 cashier's check. The seller rejected the check and said he didn't want to deliver the car. Now, the buyer is suing the seller for breach of contract. The question is, what remedies can the buyer get?

Hmm, I remember from my studies that a contract is often enforced by specific performance, which is when the buyer delivers the goods as agreed. But in this case, the seller didn't deliver. The buyer gave a check, not a car, so the seller didn't provide the required goods. Wait, but waitâ€”this is a contract for the sale of a used car. So the buyer is in a contract to receive a car. The seller didn't deliver, so that's a breach.

Let me think about the options. The options are A to I. The buyer is suing for breach of contract, so which remedies are available?

Option A: Specific performance, which would be delivering the car. But the seller didn't deliver, so that's not applicable. So A isn't a remedy.

Option B: Recovery of the cost of the cashier's check. Wait, I think that's more about damages for the seller, not the buyer. The buyer didn't pay the seller, so maybe this isn't about the buyer.

Option C: Recover market price. Market price is like the asking price, which could be higher than what the seller originally agreed to. But the seller offered a check for the contract price, so maybe the market price is higher. But the seller is stuck because he can't get the car.

Wait, but in some cases, if the seller can't deliver, the buyer can recover the contract price. Or maybe not. Specifically, the buyer is suing for breach of contract, so the options are about what the buyer can recover.

Wait, but let me think again. The buyer's contract was for a car. The seller didn't deliver. The buyer gave a check. So the seller's breach was because he didn't perform the contract.

Under the common law, a seller's breach of contract can result in damages for the buyer. But what's the specific remedy? For breach of contract, the buyer can recover the contract price. So option D says "Recovery of the contract price of the car." That sounds right.

Alternatively, I recall the buyer might be entitled to recovery of costs or other damages. But the question is about the correct remedy.

Wait, another approach: when a buyer's contract requires a delivery, and the seller doesn't deliver, the buyer can recover the contract price (the price agreed upon). But the seller could also demand the full amount (the check) as compensation for not delivering.

So the options are about which are the remedies. The buyer's options are:

A: Specific performance (no, seller didn't deliver)

B: Cost of check (maybe seller can recover this, but not the buyer, so not the buyer's remedy)

C: Market price (the seller's original contract price, is that the case?)

D: Contract price (the agreed price, which is what the buyer agreed to pay, so the buyer can recover that)

E: Transportation costs (if seller didn't deliver, maybe he had to transport the car elsewhere, but I don't think that's a remedy for the buyer).

So, the buyer's remedies could include D, which is recovery of the contract price. Or perhaps B, the cost of the check.

Wait, let me think about what each option refers to. 

Option B: Recovery of the cost of the cashier's check. That's the amount the seller paid. But the seller's breach is not about that payment; the buyer's breach would be about not delivering the car. The seller could sue for that, but the buyer is suing to recover damages, not the seller.

Wait, no. The buyer's action is suing for breach of contract, so the remedy options are about what the buyer can get. So if the seller doesn't perform, the buyer can get damages.

In the common law, when a seller doesn't deliver, the buyer can recover the contract price (the amount they agreed to pay for the car) as compensation. So option D is correct.

Other options: 

Option E is about transportation costs, which is more about the seller needing to move the car. The buyer didn't do anything wrong; the seller just couldn't get it to the buyer. So E is not applicable.

Option F says damages based on the difference between market price and contract price. That's a bit more involved. If the market price is higher than the contract price, the seller might have a reason to bring in the difference as compensation. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The buyer could be arguing that the seller's contract price was the agreed amount, regardless of market conditions. So F might not be the right answer.

Option G is emotional distress. That would be more of a personal injury claim, not covered by the standard remedy for breach of contract.

Option H is punitive damages, which are very high and usually for specific situations like fraud or fraud against a business. But this isn't a fraud case here, so H isn't right.

Option I is an injunction. That would prevent the seller from acting, but in this case, the seller rejected the tender, so the buyer can't enforce that through an injunction. So I is not applicable.

So the main options are D and F.

Wait, I think in some jurisdictions, when the seller doesn't deliver, the buyer can recover the contract price. So D is the answer.

Alternatively, the buyer could also recover the amount the seller paid (the check), but that's not a standard remedy for breach of contract. The standard is for the buyer to recover damages, which include the contract price.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Recovery of the contract price of the car.

The buyer is entitled to the contract price of the car, which is the agreed amount they were obligated to pay for the used car. The seller's rejection of the tender and failure to deliver the car constitute a breach of contract, and the buyer can recover damages for this breach. The other options either pertain to different remedies or are not applicable in this context. 

Answer: D
