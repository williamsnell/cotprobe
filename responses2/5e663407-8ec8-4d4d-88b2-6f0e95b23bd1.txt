Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about showing that a plane mirror in contact with a converging lens of focal length f is equivalent to a concave spherical mirror with radius of curvature f. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that lenses and mirrors have different properties. A converging lens has a focal length f, but a plane mirror doesn't have a focal length in the same way. Or does it? Oh, wait, the mirror equation is different. So maybe I should think about how the lens and the mirror affect the image.

I think when a plane mirror is placed in contact with a lens, it's like the mirror is part of the lens. But wait, the mirror is flat, so maybe it's a flat part of the lens. But I'm trying to think about how that affects the overall effect.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the optical equivalent. The question says that the combination is equivalent to a concave spherical mirror with radius f. So I need to find which option that corresponds to.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to break it down. A converging lens has a focal length f. When you put a plane mirror in contact, does that change the focal length of the system? Or is it about the image formation?

Alternatively, perhaps when the lens is placed with a plane mirror, the mirror's effect is to invert the image. But wait, since the mirror is flat, maybe it doesn't invert. Or perhaps it's part of the same system.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible options. The options are about different types of mirrors and their radii. The correct answer is a concave mirror with radius f, which would have a focal length of f/2.

Wait, no. The radius of curvature is twice the focal length for spherical mirrors, right? So if the radius is f, then the focal length is f/2. So a concave mirror with radius of curvature f would have a focal length of f/2.

But wait, what's the focal length of the lens? Oh, the lens is converging, so its focal length is positive, f. But the mirror is a flat one, so a plane mirror is a type of mirror with infinite focal length. Wait, no, a plane mirror is a flat mirror, but it's not a spherical mirror and has no focal point. Or perhaps in some contexts, people consider it as having an infinite focal length. But wait, I think that's not the case.

Wait, the mirror in contact with the lens is a plane mirror. So when placed in contact, it's part of the system. So the lens and the mirror would together form an optical system. Wait, but a plane mirror doesn't really have a focal point. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of combining the lens and the mirror as part of the same optical setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is equivalent to a single mirror. So if the lens is in contact with a plane mirror, maybe the mirror's effect is to invert the image, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the combination of a lens (which is a type of mirror) and a plane mirror is equivalent to another mirror.

Wait, another approach: the problem states that the mirror is placed in contact with the lens. So perhaps the mirror is acting as a flat portion of the lens. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's a flat portion of a lens, so perhaps it's part of the focal length.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the optical equivalent. The lens has a focal length f. When you place a plane mirror in contact, the mirror's effect is to invert the image. But wait, that might not be right. Or perhaps the mirror doesn't invert the image because it's a flat surface. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the combined effect is that the mirror is a flat portion of the lens, so the lens can be considered as a combination of the mirror and the rest. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the mirror being in contact with the lens might be acting as a flat surface that's part of the lens. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. The question is about showing that the combination is equivalent to a concave spherical mirror with radius f. So the radius is f, which gives a focal length of f/2. So the mirror should have a radius of curvature of f.

Wait, a concave mirror with radius curvature f would have a focal length of f/2. So, the mirror is concave and has radius f.

So the correct option is the one that says it's equivalent to a concave mirror with radius f. Looking at the options, option I says equivalent to a concave mirror with radius f. Option J is equivalent to a convex mirror with radius -f; that's a concave mirror with radius f, so same as I.

Wait, but wait. The mirror in the problem is a plane mirror. A plane mirror is technically a type of flat mirror, but in the context of optical systems, a plane mirror can be considered as a flat spherical mirror with an infinite radius of curvature. So if the mirror's radius is f, then its focal length is f/2.

So the combined mirror (lens + plane mirror) would behave like a mirror with focal length f/2. So the equivalent mirror is a concave mirror with radius f.

Looking at the options, option I says "equivalent to a concave mirror of radius f". Option I is I: equivalent to a concave mirror with radius f.

Wait, but wait, another thought. When you place a plane mirror in contact with a lens, does it change the focal length? Let me think of the lens and mirror as being part of an optical system. The lens has a focal length f. The mirror is a flat mirror, which doesn't have a focal length in the same way. But maybe when they're combined, the system's equivalent to a mirror.

Alternatively, perhaps when the lens is placed in contact with a plane mirror, the mirror's effect is to invert the image, but the lens also has its own effect. But in the question, the mirror is in contact with the lens, so perhaps the mirror's presence changes the system to behave as a single mirror.

Wait, perhaps the equivalent mirror would have the same focal length as the lens. Since the lens has a focal length f, the equivalent mirror would have the same focal length f. So the mirror would have a radius of curvature 2f. Wait, no, because the radius of curvature is twice the focal length for a spherical mirror. So a focal length of f would mean a radius of 2f.

Wait, so if the mirror is concave with focal length f, then its radius is 2f. So the equivalent mirror would have a radius of 2f.

Wait, but the options include option E as equivalent to a concave mirror of radius 2f. That would be option E.

Hmm, conflicting thoughts. Let me clarify: Is the mirror in contact with the lens acting as another mirror, or is it part of the same optical system?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the system as the lens and the mirror acting as two elements. The lens has a focal length f. The mirror is a flat one, but when placed in contact, perhaps their focal lengths combine in some way. Alternatively, maybe the lens and the mirror are arranged in such a way that the system behaves like a single mirror.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror doesn't change the system's focal length because it's a flat mirror. But no, a flat mirror doesn't contribute to the focal length in the same way. So perhaps the focal length is the same as the lens, which is f.

Wait, but wait, a convex lens has a focal length f, and a concave mirror with radius f would have a focal length of f/2. So they can't be the same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A: plane mirror, radius f. So f is the radius, which would make the focal length f/2.

B: convex mirror, radius 2f: radius of curvature 2f, so focal length f.

C: concave mirror radius f/2: so focal length f/4.

D: spherical mirror, infinite radius, so no focal length.

E: concave mirror radius 2f: so focal length f.

Wait, so if the equivalent mirror is a concave with radius f, then the focal length is f/2. So a spherical mirror with radius f would have a focal length of f/2.

But wait, the lens has a focal length of f. So the combined system (lens plus mirror) would have a focal length of f. So the equivalent mirror would have a focal length of f, right?

Wait no, wait. The system (lens and mirror) is equivalent to a single mirror. The focal length of the combined system is the same as the focal length of the single mirror. But wait, the actual behavior might be different because the lens and mirror are in series. So perhaps the focal length is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is equivalent to a single mirror with focal length f. So the radius would then be 2f.

But wait, if the mirror is concave and has radius f, its focal length is f/2. So the focal length of the mirror is f/2. So the equivalent mirror would have a focal length of f/2, which would correspond to a radius of 2f (since radius is twice the focal length for a concave mirror).

Looking at the options, option E is equivalent to a concave mirror radius 2f. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait wait, but the problem says the lens is converging, and the equivalent mirror is concave. So the focal length of the mirror is f/2, which would correspond to a radius of 2f.

So the correct option would be E: equivalent to a concave mirror with radius 2f.

Wait, but another angle: the mirror is placed in contact with the lens. So perhaps the mirror is part of the lens. So the mirror is a flat part of the lens. But that doesn't change the focal length of the lens. The focal length is determined by the lens' own properties, not by its contact with another mirror.

So the focal length of the lens is f. The mirror is part of the system, but doesn't change the focal length. So the equivalent mirror would be a mirror that has the same focal length as the lens, which is f. So the equivalent mirror would have a radius of curvature 2f.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the optical properties. The lens has a focal length f, and the mirror's equivalent is a mirror with focal length f. So the mirror would have a radius of curvature 2f.

So the mirror would be concave and have radius 2f, which is option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake and the mirror is a flat mirror, meaning it doesn't have a focal length. So the focal length of the system (lens plus mirror) would be f, because the lens has f, and the mirror doesn't add it. But that doesn't make sense because the actual system is a combination of a lens and a mirror.

Wait, perhaps the equivalent mirror is the one that's equivalent to the lens. The lens and the mirror combined have the same effect as a single mirror. So if the lens has a focal length f, then the mirror should have a focal length f. That would make the mirror concave with radius 2f.

So the correct answer is E.

The question asks whether a plane mirror placed in contact with a converging lens of focal length \( f \) is equivalent to a concave spherical mirror with radius of curvature \( f \). To determine this, we analyze the problem by considering the optical properties of the lens and the mirror.

1. **Focal Length of the Lens**: The converging lens has a focal length \( f \). A plane mirror is a flat mirror and does not have a focal length in the traditional sense. However, the problem states that the mirror is placed in contact with the lens, suggesting it modifies the optical system.

2. **Behavior of the Combined System**: The lens and the mirror are part of an optical system. The lens alone has a focal length \( f \), and the mirror, being a plane mirror, does not invert the image but does not contribute to the focal length in the same way as a lens. When combined, the system behaves as if it is equivalent to a single mirror.

3. **Equivalent Mirror**: The question specifies that the equivalent mirror should have a radius of curvature \( f \). For a concave mirror, the focal length \( f_{\text{mirror}} \) is related to the radius of curvature \( R \) by \( R = 2f_{\text{mirror}} \). Since the focal length of the lens is \( f \), the equivalent mirror must have a focal length of \( f \), corresponding to a radius of curvature \( 2f \).

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: A plane mirror with radius \( f \) would have a focal length \( f/2 \), which does not match the focal length of the lens.
   - **Option B**: A convex mirror with radius \( 2f \) would have a focal length \( f \), but the system involves a converging lens, not a convex mirror.
   - **Option C**: A concave mirror with radius \( f/2 \) would have a focal length \( f/4 \), which does not match the focal length of the lens.
   - **Option D**: A spherical mirror with infinite radius of curvature has no focal length, which does not match the focal length of the lens.
   - **Option E**: A concave mirror with radius \( 2f \) has a focal length \( f \), matching the focal length of the lens. This is consistent with the system's behavior.
   - **Option F**: Not equivalent to any mirror is incorrect because the system can be equivalent to a mirror.
   - **Option G**: A convex mirror with radius \( f \) has a focal length \( f/2 \), which does not match the focal length of the lens.
   - **Option H**: A concave mirror with radius \( -2f \) has a focal length \( -f \), which is physically impossible for a concave mirror.
   - **Option I**: A concave mirror with radius \( f \) has a focal length \( f/2 \), which does not match the focal length of the lens.
   - **Option J**: A convex mirror with radius \( -f \) has an infinite focal length, which does not match the focal length of the lens.

5. **Conclusion**: The correct answer is **Option E**, as the equivalent mirror has a focal length \( f \), corresponding to a radius of curvature \( 2f \).
