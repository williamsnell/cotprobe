Okay, so I have this problem here about a pizza parlor that offers 8 different toppings. The question is asking how many ways a customer can order a pizza with 3 toppings. The options given are A to J, with various numbers like 56, 36, etc.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step. I remember that when you have to choose items without considering the order, it's a combination problem. So, the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number you're choosing.

In this case, n is 8 toppings, and k is 3 toppings. So plugging into the formula, it would be 8!/(3!(8-3)!).

Let me calculate that. 8! is 8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1. But wait, since we have 3! in the denominator and (8-3)! which is 5!, maybe I can simplify this.

Wait, another way to write 8! is 8×7×6×5!. So when I divide 8! by 5!, the 5! cancels out. So I'm left with 8×7×6 divided by 3!.

3! is 3×2×1, which is 6. So now the equation simplifies to (8×7×6)/6. The 6 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving 8×7, which is 56.

So the number of ways is 56. Looking at the options, option A is 56. Therefore, the correct answer should be A.

The number of ways to choose 3 toppings out of 8 is calculated using combinations: \( C(8,3) = \frac{8!}{3!5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56 \).
