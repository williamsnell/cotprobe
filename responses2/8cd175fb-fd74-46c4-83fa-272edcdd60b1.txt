Okay, so I've got this problem here about positive integers and their differences. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is: In a set of 20 positive integers, at least how many pairs of numbers have a difference that's a multiple of 10? The options are from A to J, with various numbers. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember something about modular arithmetic and the pigeonhole principle. Oh right, the pigeonhole principle says that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. Maybe that applies here.

Wait, the problem is about differences being multiples of 10. So, the difference being a multiple of 10 is the same as saying the two numbers are congruent modulo 10. Because if a - b is divisible by 10, then a ≡ b mod 10.

So, each number can be categorized by its remainder when divided by 10. The possible remainders are 0,1,2,...,9. That's 10 categories or "pigeonholes" maybe.

I have 20 numbers, which are like the "pigeons." So, trying to distribute 20 numbers into 10 categories (remainders). The pigeonhole principle says that if you have n objects and m containers, then at least one container will have at least ceil(n/m) objects. But here, we're looking for pairs, not just individual counts.

Wait, but how many pairs? Each pair is two numbers. So, the number of possible pairs is C(20,2) which is (20×19)/2 = 190.

But I'm not looking for the maximum number of such pairs. The question is, what's the minimum number of such pairs we can have. So, to minimize the number of pairs where the two numbers are congruent mod 10, we want to distribute the numbers as evenly as possible among the 10 categories.

Because if we spread the 20 numbers as evenly as possible, each remainder category will have either 2 or 3 numbers, right? Because 10 × 2 = 20, so each category would have exactly 2 numbers.

Wait, wait. 20 divided by 10 is 2. So, each remainder class will have exactly 2 numbers. So, in each group, how many pairs can we form? For a group with k elements, the number of pairs is C(k,2) = k*(k-1)/2.

So, for each category with 2 numbers, the number of pairs is 2*1/2 = 1 pair per category. Since there are 10 categories, that's 10 × 1 = 10 pairs in total.

So, the minimal number of pairs with a difference divisible by 10 is 10. That would mean the answer is B:10.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought the pigeonhole principle would tell us that with 20 elements and 10 holes, at least one hole has 2 elements. But this is about the number of pairs. Oh, right, because each pair must be in the same hole. So, the minimal number of such pairs is when the distribution is as even as possible.

So, if each remainder has 2 numbers, then each remainder contributes 1 pair. So, 10 remainders × 1 pair each = 10 pairs. That's the minimum. So, the answer should be 10, which is option B.
</think>

To determine the minimum number of pairs with a difference divisible by 10, we categorize each number by its remainder when divided by 10 (0 through 9). With 20 numbers and 10 categories, the most even distribution is 2 numbers per category. Each category contributes 1 pair, leading to a total of 10 pairs. Thus, the minimum number is **10**.

Answer: B
