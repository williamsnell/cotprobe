Question:

A city has adopted the following ordinance which provides:"Section 1: It shall be unlawful for any person, group, or organization to hold a meeting of 50 persons or more in any city park without first securing a city permit;Section 2: The application shall specify the day and hours for which the permit is sought. The fee shall be $10 per hour, with a maximum fee of $50;Section 3: Permits shall be issued on a first come basis; provided that the chief of police shall deny any application if, after hearing the applicant, it is his considered judgment that (a) the meeting would create serious traffic congestion, or (b) interfere with public enjoyment of the park, or (c) speakers at the meeting would advocate the commission of crime. "A religious fundamentalist who believes that other religions should be violently resisted, planned to hold a protest demonstration against other religions at a city park on July 25. Although his previous anti-religion protest rallies attracted fewer than 25 demonstrators, he decided to apply for a permit pursuant to the city's ordinance. After meeting with the fundamentalist, the chief of police denied his permit application because he believed that the demonstration would incite the protestors and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. On July 25, the fundamentalist and his fellow demonstrators staged their protest at a city park. The rally attracted only about 20 protestors and was conducted peacefully. As he was making his final remarks to the gathering, the city police arrived at the park and arrested him and his fellow demonstrators charging them with violating the city ordinance. If the fundamentalist now brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of Section 3 of the city ordinance, his best argument would be that

Options:

A: the section does not fall within the area of compelling state interest.
B: the section is content based.
C: the section permits the police chief to exercise unbridled discretion in approving or disapproving permits.
D: the section imposes undue financial burden on applicants.
E: the section does not specify a clear process for appeal against permit denial.
F: the section discriminates against certain religious beliefs.
G: the section violates the right to peaceful assembly.
H: the section does not provide specific criteria for denial of permits.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a city ordinance and a religious group suing it. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out the right answer.

The ordinance has three sections. Section 1 says that a meeting of 50 or more people in a city park can't happen without a city permit. The fee is $10 per hour, up to $50. Section 2 specifies the day and time for the permit. Section 3 says permits are issued on a first-come basis, but the police chief has to approve them before they're granted. 

Now, the religious fundamentalist applied for a permit, but the chief denied it because he thought the protest would incite violence or create traffic congestion or threaten public safety. He had a peaceful demonstration with about 20 people. Then, the police arrived, arrested him, and he sued the city.

The question is about the best argument the fundamentalist's suit would have against Section 3. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Section doesn't fall within compelling state interest. Compelling state interest means the interest is so significant that it's likely to be supported by state action. The city has the right to regulate event types, but perhaps the issue here isn't about state action. I'm not sure.

Option B: Section is content-based. Content is about the substance, not the purpose. Section 3 is about permits, which relates to public safety and order. So this seems relevant.

Option C: Discretion issues. This option suggests the police chief can exercise discretion beyond what's allowed. But Section 3 says permits are granted on first come, meaning the police need to approve each permit. So the chief is acting as an intermediary, which might be seen as unbridled discretion.

Option D: Financial burden. The fee is $10 per hour, up to $50. So each hour is a small fee. If the meeting was a few hours, the total would be low. But the argument about burden might be more about whether the fee is unreasonable or whether it's necessary.

Option E: No clear process for appealing. Section 3 allows first-come, but doesn't say anything about appeal processes. If the police chief appraises the permit, the process for appeal isn't specified. So the city might not be allowing the same level of appeal as other permits.

Option F: Discrimination against certain religions. The issue here is the police chief's decision was based on whether the demonstration would cause violence. The religious group's belief about other religions should be respected, not discriminative.

Option G: Section doesn't specify criteria. The section says permits are first-come on a police chief's approval. So the criteria are the chief's judgment, which would be a clear criteria. So this option is likely incorrect because the section does specify the criteria.

Option H: No specific criteria. Wait, Section 3's language says permits are issued on a first-come basis. So the criteria are the chief's judgment, not something specified in the section. So according to this, the section does specify the criteria (the chief's consideration), so H is incorrect.

So, the main issue is whether the section is content-based. If the section is about granting permits based on the chief's judgment, that's content. If it's about making a permit without a permit, that's state action. So the best argument against Section 3 would be that it's content-based.

Looking back at the options: Option B is "the section is content-based." That sounds like the best argument because the issue is about the substance of the regulation (permitting events based on the chief's judgment), not about state action.

The issue revolves around whether Section 3 of the city's ordinance is content-based or subject to state action. Section 3 states that permits are granted on a first-come basis, with the chief of police evaluating the merits of the application. The religious group's argument is that Section 3 doesn't specify clear criteria, making it content-based and thus in violation of the First Amendment.

**Answer: B: the section is content-based.**
