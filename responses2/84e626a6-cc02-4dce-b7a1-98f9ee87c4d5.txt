Alright, so I've got this question about whether the polynomial x² -12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

Wait, Eisenstein's criterion, right. I remember it's a way to determine if a polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers. The criterion requires that there exists a prime number p such that three conditions are met. First, p divides all the coefficients except the leading one. Second, p doesn't divide the leading coefficient. Third, p squared doesn't divide the constant term.

So the polynomial given is x² -12. Let me write that down: f(x) = x² -12.

I think Eisenstein's criterion applies to polynomials in the form a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0. In this case, a_2 is 1, a_1 is 0, and a_0 is -12.

Wait, wait, but Eisenstain's criterion applies to monic polynomials, which is when the leading coefficient is 1. So f(x) is monic here because the coefficient of x² is 1. So that fits.

Now, I need to find a prime p that divides all the coefficients except the leading one, doesn't divide the leading coefficient (which is 1, so any p will do that), and p squared doesn't divide the constant term.

Looking at f(x) = x² -12. The coefficients are 1, 0, -12. Let's see if there's a prime p that divides 0 and -12, but not 1.

Wait, the coefficients are 1 (x²), 0 (x), and -12 (constant). So p must divide 0 and -12, and not divide 1.

But wait, any prime p divides 0 because anything divides 0. So that condition is satisfied for any p. But also, p mustn't divide the leading coefficient, which is 1. Since p is a prime, it can't divide 1. So that condition is satisfied for any p.

The third condition is that p squared doesn't divide the constant term. The constant term is -12, so p² doesn't divide -12.

So, let's find a prime p such that p² doesn't divide 12. Let me think about the primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.

Let's test p=2: p squared is 4. Does 4 divide 12? Yes, 12 divided by 4 is 3. So 4 divides 12. That means p=2 would not satisfy the third condition because 2 squared divides 12.

Next, p=3: p squared is 9. Does 9 divide 12? No, because 12 divided by 9 is 1.333... So 9 doesn't divide 12. So p=3 satisfies all the conditions.

So Eisenstein's criterion is satisfied with p=3.

Looking back at the options, option G says Yes, with p=3.

So the answer should be G.
</think>

The polynomial f(x) = x² -12 satisfies Eisenstein's criterion with p=3 because:

1. All coefficients except the leading coefficient are divisible by 3 (0 and -12 are divisible by 3).
2. The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 3.
3. 3 squared, which is 9, does not divide -12.

Thus, the correct choice is G: Yes, with p=3.

Answer: G
