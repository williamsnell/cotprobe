Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the multiplicity of the root ξ = 1 for the polynomial P(x) = x^5 - 2x^4 + 4x^3 - x^2 -7x +5. And then, after determining that, I have to compute P'(2) + P''(2). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, multiplicity of a root. I remember that the multiplicity of a root is the number of times it's a root of the polynomial. So, if I have a root ξ, and when I factor the polynomial, the root will appear as many times as its multiplicity. But wait, how do I find that using synthetic division?

Right, synthetic division is a shortcut method to divide polynomials by a binomial of the form (x - c), where c is a potential root. So, if I can perform synthetic division with c=1, I can find out how many times (x-1) divides into the polynomial. The number of times it does, that's the multiplicity.

Let me set up the synthetic division for P(x) divided by (x - 1). So, the coefficients of P(x) are 1 (x^5), -2 (x^4), 4 (x^3), -1 (x^2), -7 (x), and 5 (constant term).

I'll write down the coefficients: 1 | -2 | 4 | -1 | -7 | 5

Now, I'll bring down the 1. Then, multiply by 1 (the root), so 1*1=1, add to the next coefficient: -2 +1 = -1.

Next, multiply -1 by 1: -1*1 = -1. Add to next coefficient: 4 + (-1) = 3.

Multiply 3 by 1: 3. Add to next coefficient: -1 +3 = 2.

Multiply 2 by 1: 2. Add to next coefficient: -7 +2 = -5.

Multiply -5 by 1: -5. Add to last coefficient: 5 + (-5) = 0. Oh, so the remainder is 0, which means (x -1) is a factor. 

But wait, the remainder is zero, so that's the first step. Now, since the remainder is zero, I can continue the synthetic division to find how many times (x-1) is a factor. Let's see the coefficients after division:

1 | -1 | 3 | 2 | -5

So, we have 1, -1, 3, 2, -5 as the new coefficients. Now, we take each of these and multiply by 1 again.

Starting with 1: 1*1=1. Add to -1: -1 +1=0.

Next, 0*1=0. Add to 3: 3 +0=3.

Next, 3*1=3. Add to 2: 2+3=5.

Next, 5*1=5. Add to -5: -5 +5=0.

So, the next remainder is 0. That means (x -1) is a double root.

But wait, when I continued the division, the last term was 0, which means (x -1) is a factor twice. So, the multiplicity is 2.

Wait, let me double-check. The last non-zero remainder was 0, meaning the root is of multiplicity 2. So, the multiplicity is 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when I did the first synthetic division, I got remainder zero, so (x-1) is a factor. Then, I continued and found another zero remainder, so (x -1) is a factor again. So, the multiplicity is 2.

So, the root ξ=1 has multiplicity 2.

Now, the second part of the problem is to compute P'(2) + P''(2). Hmm, calculus involved here.

First, I need to find the first and second derivatives of P(x), then evaluate them at x=2, and add the two results.

Let me compute P'(x):

P(x) = x^5 -2x^4 +4x^3 -x^2 -7x +5

P'(x) = 5x^4 - 8x^3 + 12x^2 -2x -7

Now, compute P''(x):

P''(x) = derivative of P'(x) = 20x^3 -24x^2 +24x -2

Now, evaluate P'(2) and P''(2).

Compute P'(2):

5*(2)^4 = 5*16 =80

-8*(2)^3 = -8*8= -64

12*(2)^2=12*4=48

-2*(2)= -4

-7 remains.

Add them up:

80 -64 = 16

16 +48 =64

64 -4 =60

60 -7=53.

So P'(2) =53.

Now P''(2):

20*(2)^3 =20*8=160

-24*(2)^2 =-24*4=-96

24*(2)=48

-2 remains.

Adding up:

160 -96 =64

64 +48=112

112 -2=110.

So P''(2)=110.

So, P'(2) + P''(2) =53 +110=163.

Check the options: Option G is 158, H is 163. So, the answer should be H:163.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculations to be safe.

P'(x)=5x^4 -8x^3 +12x^2 -2x -7.

At x=2:

5*(16)=80

-8*(8)= -64 → 80-64=16

12*(4)=48 →16+48=64

-2*(2)= -4 →64-4=60

-7 →60-7=53. Correct.

P''(x)=20x^3 -24x^2 +24x -2.

x=2:

20*(8)=160

-24*(4)= -96 →160-96=64

24*(2)=48 →64+48=112

-2 →112-2=110.

So 53+110=163. So, the correct answer is 163. Looking at the options, that's option G, but wait, the options in the problem are A to J, where option G is 158 and H is 163. So the correct answer is H:163.

The multiplicity of ξ=1 is 2. 

Next, compute the derivatives:

P'(x) = 5x⁴ - 8x³ + 12x² - 2x -7  
P''(x) = 20x³ -24x² +24x -2  

Evaluate at x=2:

P'(2) = 5*(16) -8*(8) +12*(4) -2*(2) -7 = 80 -64 +48 -4 -7 = 53  
P''(2) = 20*(8) -24*(4) +24*(2) -2 = 160 -96 +48 -2 = 110  

Sum: 53 + 110 = 163.
