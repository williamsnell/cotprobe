Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bicycle that's being marked down. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The original price is $138.00, and it's being marked down by 15%. Hmm, I need to calculate what the new price would be after this discount. I think I should start by finding out how much the discount is and then subtract that from the original price.

Wait, 15% of 138. Let me calculate that. So, 15% is the same as 0.15 in decimal. Multiplying 138 by 0.15... Let me do the math. 138 times 0.15. Breaking it down, 100 times 0.15 is 15, 38 times 0.15 is... 5.7. Oh wait, wait, waitâ€”15% of 138. Let me multiply 138 by 15 and then divide by 100. Oh, 138 *15 is 2070. Divided by 100 is 20.7. So the discount is $20.70.

Now, the new price is the original price minus the discount. So, 138 minus 20.7. Let me subtract. 138 minus 20 is 118, and then minus 0.7 is 117.3. So the new price should be $117.30.

Looking at the options, option G is $117.30. So the correct answer should be G.

The new price after a 15% discount on a $138 bicycle is calculated by finding 15% of $138 (which is $20.70) and subtracting this from the original price. Thus, $138 - $20.70 = $117.30. The correct answer is G.

Answer: G
