Okay, so I've got this question about work design theories and job satisfaction. Hmm, let me think through this. The question asks which theoretical perspective enhances job satisfaction and productivity the most. The options are A to J, each corresponding to a different theory.

First, I need to recall what each theory emphasizes. Work design theories deal with how work is structured and managed, influencing factors like job satisfaction and productivity.

Option A: Human Relations theory. I remember this theory is about how individuals interact within the workplace. It focuses on group dynamics and relationships. It might talk about how employees feel about their work and how that affects satisfaction. This could contribute to productivity because effective relationships can lead to better engagement and performance.

Option B: Process improvement. This is more about improving the processes within an organization to increase efficiency. It's more about the mechanics of how work is done rather than the satisfaction or productivity of the individuals involved. So maybe not the right fit for job satisfaction and productivity.

Option C: Job enrichment theory. This theory emphasizes creating opportunities for employees to grow and develop through the work itself. It's about the benefits of a good job that goes beyond the basic requirements. This could enhance job satisfaction because employees feel more valued and motivated as they contribute more, leading to better productivity.

Option D: Job enlargement theory. This is more about expanding the scope of work to include more tasks. It's about increasing the volume of work, which could lead to higher productivity but might also require more resources. It might not directly focus on satisfaction but more on how much work is done.

Option E: Time and Motion study. This is about understanding how workers perform tasks and how to improve efficiency. It's part of productivity but doesn't directly address job satisfaction or the broader work design.

Option F: Techno-structural change model. I'm not too sure about this. Techno-structural change refers to changes in organizational structure that involve technological advancements. Maybe it's about how technology affects work design. Not sure it's the best fit here.

Option G: Scientific management theory. I think this was developed by Taylor and Francis. It focuses on scientific methods to improve work processes, quality, and productivity. It's about efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace, which would enhance productivity. But does it directly emphasize job satisfaction?

Option H: Socio-technical systems. I'm not too familiar with this one. It might relate to how technical aspects are managed in the workplace, perhaps in terms of supervision or technology. Not sure how this would directly affect job satisfaction.

Option I: Motivational theory. This is about the forces that drive employees. It includes theories like Maslow's hierarchy of needs. While it affects motivation, which in turn affects job satisfaction, I'm not sure if it's the most direct answer here.

Option J: Job characteristics model. This theory looks at what makes a job good or bad. It might discuss factors like the nature of work, pay, and structure. It could influence job satisfaction by identifying what aspects are important, but I'm not certain if it's the best fit for the question.

Now, the question is about enhancing both job satisfaction and productivity. Job satisfaction is about the value the employee feels they're getting, and productivity is about efficiency.

Looking back at the theories:

- Job enrichment (C) focuses on the quality of work, which can lead to higher job satisfaction. More enriching work can involve more challenging tasks or better opportunities for growth, leading to higher productivity because employees feel more valued and motivated.

- Job enlargement (D) increases work volume, which might lead to more tasks but perhaps less individual contribution. This could improve productivity but might not directly explain how that affects satisfaction, unless it's about more engaged employees.

- The other theories like Time and Motion (E) or Scientific Management (G) focus more on efficiency and processes, which improve productivity but might not directly address the satisfaction aspects as much as job enrichment.

So, the best answer seems to be C: Job enrichment theory. It directly ties to enhancing job satisfaction by making the work more fulfilling and valuable.

The correct answer is C: Job enrichment theory. This theory emphasizes the quality and value of the work, which can enhance job satisfaction by encouraging more engaged and motivated employees. It supports the idea that enriching work leads to higher productivity as employees feel valued and motivated. 

Answer: C
