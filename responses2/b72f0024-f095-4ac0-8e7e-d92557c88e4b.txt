Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the activities that people who are retired might do. The question is asking which of the options listed is NOT one of the more commonly performed activities for retired individuals. The options are A through J.

Let me go through them one by one. The options are:

A: Starting a new business
B: Working part-time
C: Mountain climbing
D: Household chores
E: Travel
F: Writing a book
G: Redoing the home
H: DJing at local clubs
I: Attending educational courses
J: Volunteering

Hmm, first, I should think about what activities people do when they're retired. Retired folks often have more time, so they might spend more time on things that don't require constant work, like personal time, hobbies, and maybe enjoying their hobbies more.

Option A: Starting a new business. That sounds like a typical job for someone who's not retired. They would probably want to find a new job. So I don't think this is the correct answer because it's something you'd do before retiring, not after.

Option B: Working part-time. That's possible for those who are retired. They might stay at home or have part-time jobs to balance their retirement. So this is a common activity.

Option C: Mountain climbing. This is something that people do when they're active and have time to go for a walk. For retired folks, maybe they do this occasionally, especially if they enjoy it, but it's not something they do every day.

Option D: Household chores. This is a common activity for anyone, including those who are retired, so this is probably not the answer.

Option E: Travel. Being retired, people might take time off or travel for various reasons like visiting family, friends, or for personal interest. So this is a possibility, so not the answer.

Option F: Writing a book. This is a creative activity. Some retired folks might use their time to write a book to pass the time, so this is a possible activity.

Option G: Redoing the home. This is a bit unusual. I think most people wouldn't redo their homes unless they have a specific reason, maybe for nostalgia or to restore condition. So this could be considered unusual and maybe not something done by retired individuals often.

Option H: DJing at clubs. DJing is a job, so this is a typical activity for someone who's retired, especially if they're into music or have a job that requires that.

Option I: Attending educational courses. This is possible, especially if someone is retired and has time to take courses or workshops.

Option J: Volunteering. This is common for many people, including retired ones, so this is likely not the answer.

So, looking at all the options, the ones that are more likely to be done by retired people are B, F, H, I, J, and E. The question is about which is NOT, so we're looking for the odd one out.

Now, checking the options again, I think G: Redoing the home. That doesn't seem like a common activity for those who are retired. People might do things like reading or hobbies, but redoing the home is more of a once-in-a-lifetime project, so maybe it's not so common.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe some people do it occasionally, but is it considered a more frequent activity? I'm a bit confused because I know some people do it, but others might not. But the question is about the activity that is NOT commonly done by retired people, so G might be the one.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about each option's typical activity. Let's consider each option:

A: Starting a business - definitely not for retirement; you'd have a job.

B: Part-time work - yes, possible.

C: Mountain climbing - maybe, but not as much as other activities.

D: Household chores - yes, possible.

E: Travel - possible, especially for vacation or family time.

F: Writing a book - possible, especially if someone is into self-improvement.

G: Redoing the home - maybe for nostalgia or personal interest, but not as frequent.

H: DJing - yes.

I: Educational courses - yes.

J: Volunteering - yes.

So, G is the only one that doesn't fit. So the question is which is NOT done often, so G is the answer.

The activity that is NOT commonly done by retired individuals is G: Redoing the home. This is unusual and not frequently performed by those who are retired. 

Answer: G
