Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. The question is to estimate the sum of 153 and 44. And then I have to choose which range the sum falls into from the given options. Hmm, let's see.

First, I'll try to add the numbers exactly to get the actual sum. 153 plus 44. Let me do that step by step. 153 plus 44, I can break it down. 150 plus 40 is 190, and 3 plus 4 is 7. So adding those together, 190 plus 7 equals 197. So the exact sum is 197.

Now, the question is about estimating, so I'm probably supposed to round the numbers first to make the calculation easier. Let me think. 153 is pretty close to 150, and 44 is close to 40. Adding 150 and 40 gives 190. Hmm, but that's an underestimate because 153 is 3 more than 150, and 44 is 4 more than 40. So the total overestimation is 3 +4=7. So 190 plus 7 is 197. So the actual sum is 197.

Wait, but maybe the question is about estimating without doing exact addition. Like, rounding each number to the nearest hundred or so. Let's see.

153 is approximately 200, and 44 is approximately 0. Wait, 44 is 40, so maybe 100? No, wait. 153 is closer to 200 than to 100? Or wait, no. Wait, 150 is in the 100s, so 153 is 53 above 100, so perhaps 200 is a good estimate. And 44 is 40, so that's about 40. So 200 plus 40 would be 240. But wait, the exact sum is 197, which is 43 less than 240. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Maybe I should consider using a different rounding method.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing estimation techniques, like rounding to the nearest ten or hundred. Let me think again about exact sum. 153 +44 is 197. So the exact answer is 197, which is between 200 and 190. But the options are in ranges. So, looking at the options, I need to find which range 197 falls into.

Looking at the options:

A: 1,100 and 1,299 → way too big, 197 is way below that.

B: 900 and 1,099 → even bigger, not relevant.

C: 50 and 99 → way too low, 197 is way higher.

D: 100 and 299 → 197 is within this range.

E: 400 and 599 → 197 is below this.

F: 500 and 699 → 197 is too low.

G: 700 and 899 → 197 is lower.

H: 300 and 499 → 197 is lower.

I: 200 and 399 → 197 is lower, but 197 is just below 200.

J: 600 and 799 → way too high.

Wait, so 197 is between 200 and 399, but according to the options, option I is 200 and 399. So the sum is between 200 and 399. But wait, the exact sum is 197. So the actual sum is lower than 200, but the question is about estimating. So if I round each number to the nearest hundred, 153 rounds to 200, and 44 rounds to 0 (if we subtract 44, it's 44, so 0 isn't correct. Wait, perhaps each number is rounded to the nearest hundred. 153 is 200, 44 is 0 (but that can't be right). Wait, 44 is closer to 0 than to 100, so it would round to 0. So 200 + 0 is 200. But the exact sum is 197. So the estimate is 200, but the actual is 197. Hmm.

But the question is asking for an estimate, so when it says estimate, perhaps the options are about rounding each number to the nearest hundred and then adding. So 153 rounds to 200, 44 rounds to 0. So 200 +0=200, which is option I. But wait, another approach is to round each number individually without adding first. 153 is approximately 150, and 44 is approximately 40. So 150+40=190. So the estimate is 190, which is in the 100s. Looking at the options, D is 100-299, so that's correct. But wait, 190 is within that range. So, when estimating, using 150 and 40, the sum is 190. So the estimate is between 100 and 299.

Wait, but earlier I thought the exact sum is 197, but in the options, D is 100-299, which includes 197. So is the correct answer D? Or is there another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps each number is rounded to the nearest ten. 153 is 150, 44 is 40. 150+40=190. That's the same as before. So the estimate would be 190, which is within D's range.

Alternatively, rounding each number to the nearest hundred: 153 is 200, 44 is 0. So 200+0=200. So the estimate is 200, which is between 200 and 399 (option I).

So which approach is correct? The question is about estimating, but it's not clear whether it's rounding each number first or getting a rough estimate.

Wait, the question says "the sum is between which numbers?" So the exact sum is 197, so the actual sum is between 197 and 197. Wait, the options all give ranges, perhaps the sum is within the range given by the options. Wait, the options are like 1100-1299, 900-1099, etc. But our exact sum is 197, so let me look at all options.

Option D: 100 and 299. 197 is within this range.

Option I: 200 and 399. 197 is below that, so the actual sum is below I's lower limit.

Wait, but the question is about the sum being between which numbers, not the exact value. So perhaps it's asking for the range that contains the actual sum, not the estimated one.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe the question is about estimating, so the estimate is the sum. So, how is the estimate done? Maybe the question expects me to round each number to the nearest hundred and then add.

So 153 rounds to 200, 44 rounds to 0 (but wait, 44 is 44, which is closer to 0 than to 100). But 0 is not a hundred, so perhaps 44 rounds to 0, which would make the estimate 200. But 200 is the estimate.

Wait, but 200 is option I. Alternatively, some may round 44 to 100, but 44 is closer to 0 than to 100. Because 44 is 44 away from 0 and 56 away from 100 (100-44=56). So 44 is closer to 0.

Wait, so if 153 is 200, and 44 is 0, the sum is 200. So the estimate would be 200, which would be option I. But wait, the actual sum is 197, which is just 3 less than 200. So the estimate is a bit high, but it's 200. So the answer would be the estimate is 200, which is option I.

But wait, another approach: perhaps rounding to the nearest 100. 153 is 150, 44 is 40. 150+40=190. So the estimate is 190, which is within 100-299 (option D).

Hmm, but which approach is correct?

Wait, the question is about estimating the sum. So, perhaps it's better to round each number to the nearest hundred first. 153 is 150 when rounded to the nearest hundred, and 44 is 0 (as it's closer to 0 than 100). So 150 +0=150. But that's not one of the options. Wait, but in the options, the closest would be D (100-299). But 150 is within that range.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to round each number to the nearest ten. 153 is 150, 44 is 40. Sum is 190, which is within 100-299. So D.

Wait, but let me think again. The exact sum is 197. So the actual sum is 197. So which of the options are ranges that contain 197?

Looking at the options:

A: 1100-1299 → No.

B:900-1099 → No.

C:50-99→ No.

D:100-299→ Yes, 197 is in this.

E:400-599 → No, 197 is below.

F:500-699 → No.

G:700-899 → No.

H:300-499 → No.

I:200-399→ 197 is below 200, so no.

J:600-799→ No.

So the only option that includes the actual sum is D:100-299.

So the sum is between 100 and 299.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 153 rounds to 200, and 44 rounds to 0, making the estimate 200. But that's option I, which includes 200-399. But wait, option D is 100-299, which also includes 200.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a quick estimation without rounding. Let me think: 153 is about 150, 44 is about 40. 150+40=190. So the estimate is 190, which is in D.

Wait, but the options ask for the sum to be between which numbers. So the sum is 197. So the actual sum is 197, which is in D's range.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question expects me to round each number to the nearest hundred. 153 is 150, 44 is 0 (since 44 is closer to 0 than to 100). So 150 +0 =150, which is between 100 and 299, so option D.

But I'm a bit confused because the exact answer is 197, which is in D's range.

Wait, but maybe the question expects the estimate to be the nearest hundred, not the exact sum. So 153 is 150, 44 is 0, so sum is 150, but that's not an option.

Hmm, but the options are about the sum being between which numbers, not the estimate. So the actual sum is 197, so it's between 197, which is not one of the options. So I think I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the options are about the sum, but the question is about estimating. So the estimate would be something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is to choose between ranges that the sum could fall into. For example, the sum could be in the hundreds, or tens, or units. So 197 is in the hundreds (100-199), which is included in option D (100-299) and G (700-899). But 197 is in D.

Wait, but the options are the ranges that the sum is between when estimated. So for instance, if I estimate 153 as 150, and 44 as 40, the sum is 190, which is in D's range. Alternatively, if I round 153 to 200 and 44 to 0, the sum is 200, which is in I's range.

But the question says to estimate. So perhaps the correct approach is to round each number to the nearest hundred and add. So 153 rounds up to 200, 44 rounds to 0. So 200, which is in option I: 200-399.

But wait, 200 is at the lower end of option I. But could the question be looking for a higher estimate? Or is 200 the correct estimate?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to round each number to the nearest ten and then add. So 153 is 150, 44 is 40. 150+40=190, which is in D's range.

Hmm, but the options are the ranges that the sum is between when estimated. So for instance, 153 is approximately 200, 44 is approximately 0. 200+0=200. So the estimate is 200, which is between 200 and 399, option I.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the estimation method of rounding each number to the nearest hundred and adding, which would give 150+40=190, which is in option D.

Wait, but 190 is in D's range. So which is correct? I'm a bit stuck.

Another angle: let's look at the options again. The options are A to J, each a range.

The exact sum is 197. So the actual sum is 197, which is in the 100s, 200s, and 300s. So the only option that includes 197 is D (100-299), and also G (700-899). But 197 is not in G. So D is the only option that includes it.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question is about whether the sum is between certain ranges when using estimation techniques. For example, when rounding to the nearest hundred, the sum would be 150+0=150, which is in D's range. But the actual sum is 197, which is higher than 150.

Alternatively, when rounding each number to the nearest ten, 153 is 150, 44 is 40. 150+40=190, which is in D's range.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D. But another consideration: the question is about estimating the sum, so perhaps the answer is D, as it's the range that includes the exact sum.

Wait, but in the first calculation, I thought the exact sum is 197, so it's between 100 and 299, which is option D. So I think the correct answer is D.

The sum of 153 and 44 is 197. Among the given ranges, 197 falls within the range of 100 to 299. 

Answer: D: 100 and 299
