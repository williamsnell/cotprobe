Okay, so I have this probability problem in front of me about conditional distributions and expectations. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The question says that X and Y are jointly distributed with a density function f(x, y). The function is given as x when 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1. Wait, wait, no. Let me check again. Oh, the user wrote it as f(x, y) = x + ... but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Wait, no, the user wrote 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1, and f(x, y) equals x plus something. Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me look again.

Wait, the user wrote: X and Y are jointly distributed with density f(x, y) = x when 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1 and = 0 otherwise. Oh, no, that can't be right because if it's x, then it's dependent on x, which is the same as just x, but x is a variable, not a constant. Wait, maybe it's f(x, y) = x for 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the density function should integrate to 1 over the domain. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's f(x, y) = x + y for 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1? No, that's not right either. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again.

The user wrote: X and Y are jointly distributed with density f(x, y) = x + ... for 0 < x <1, 0 < y <1 and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that's confusing because x is used as a variable and also part of the density function. Wait, perhaps it's f(x, y) = x + y? But that would make the function have units that don't make sense for a density, which is dimensionless. Hmm. Or maybe the user meant f(x, y) = x * y? That would make more sense. Or perhaps it's f(x, y) = x + y, but that would be a sum, not a product.

Wait, maybe the density function is f(x, y) = x for 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1, but that doesn't integrate to 1. Because integrating x over 0 < x <1 and 0 < y <1 would give (1/2)(1)(1) = 1/2. So the total integral is 1/2, which can't be a valid density because it should integrate to 1. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the function.

Wait, maybe the function is f(x, y) = x + y for 0 < x <1 and 0 < y <1. Let's try to see.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you integrate over x and y, the integral of x + y over [0,1] for both variables would be ∫(x) dx from 0 to1 multiplied by ∫(y) dy from 0 to1, which is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4. So that's even less than 1. So that can't be a valid density function either.

Wait, maybe the correct function is f(x, y) = x * y for 0 < x <1 and 0 < y <1. Let me calculate the integral over that region. The integral of x*y from 0 to1 in x and 0 to1 in y would be [x²/2] from 0 to1 times [y²/2] from 0 to1, so (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Still not 1. Hmm, perhaps the function is f(x, y) = 2x + 2y? Or maybe it's f(x,y) = x + 1 for 0 <x<1, 0<y<1.

Wait, perhaps the function is f(x, y) = x + y, but that would have a higher integral. Let me see, if f(x, y) = x + y, then the integral over [0,1]x[0,1] would be ∫(x + y) dx dy.

First, integrate with respect to y:
∫(x + y) dy from 0 to1 is x*y + y²/2 evaluated from 0 to1 → x*1 + 1/2 - 0 = x + 1/2.
Now, integrate that over x from 0 to1:
∫(x + 1/2) dx = (x²/2) + (1/2)x evaluated from 0 to1 → (1/2) + (1/2) =1. Oh! So the total integral is 1. So f(x, y) = x + y is a valid density function over 0 <x<1 and 0<y<1.

Wait, but x is a variable, and y is another variable. So perhaps f(x, y) = x + y is the correct density function here.

Okay, so the joint density function is f(x,y) = x + y, where 0 < x <1 and 0 < y <1.

Now, the question is about the conditional expectation of Y given X = x. So we're looking for E[Y | X = x].

The formula for the conditional expectation is E[Y | X=x] = ∫ y * f(y | x) dy, where f(y|x) is the conditional density of Y given X=x.

The conditional density f(y|x) is given by f(x,y) divided by f_X(x), where f_X(x) is the marginal density of X.

So first, let me find f_X(x), the marginal density of X.

f_X(x) = ∫ f(x, y) dy from y=0 to1. So f_X(x) = ∫ (x + y) dy from 0 to1.

Integrating x + y with respect to y:

∫(x + y) dy = x*y + (y²)/2 evaluated from 0 to1 → x*1 + (1^2)/2 - 0 = x + 1/2.

So f_X(x) = x + 1/2, for 0 <x<1.

Now, the conditional density f(y|x) = f(x,y) / f_X(x) = (x + y) / (x + 1/2).

So to find E[Y | X=x], we need to integrate y * [ (x + y) / (x + 1/2) ] dy from y=0 to1.

Wait, let's write that integral:

E[Y | X=x] = ∫₀¹ y * (x + y) / (x + 1/2) dy.

Let's factor out 1/(x + 1/2) since it's a constant with respect to y:

E[Y | X=x] = [1/(x + 1/2)] * ∫₀¹ y(x + y) dy.

Expanding the integrand:

y(x + y) = x*y + y².

So the integral becomes ∫ (x y + y²) dy from 0 to1.

Compute that integral:

∫x y dy = x * [y²/2] from 0 to1 → x*(1/2 - 0) = x/2.

∫y² dy = [y³/3] from 0 to1 → 1/3 - 0 = 1/3.

So the integral is x/2 + 1/3.

Putting it back into E[Y | X=x]:

E[Y | X=x] = [ (x/2 + 1/3) ] / (x + 1/2).

Let me write that as:

(x/2 + 1/3) divided by (x + 1/2).

Let me combine the numerator terms. To add x/2 and 1/3, I'll find a common denominator. Let's see, the common denominator between 2 and 3 is 6.

So,

x/2 = 3x/6,

1/3 = 2/6.

So the numerator becomes (3x + 2)/6.

Denominator is x + 1/2 = (2x + 1)/2.

So now, the expression is ( (3x + 2)/6 ) / ( (2x + 1)/2 ).

Dividing two fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal:

(3x + 2)/6 * 2/(2x +1) = (3x + 2)*2 / (6*(2x +1)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2*(3x+2) / (6*(2x +1)).

Factor numerator and denominator:

The 2 in numerator and 6 in denominator reduces to 1 and 3 (since 6=2*3). So:

(3x+2) * (1) / (3*(2x +1)).

So simplifying, (3x + 2)/(3*(2x +1)).

Which is (3x +2)/(6x +3).

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option G: (3x + 2)/(3(2x + 1)) → which is exactly what I have.

Wait, let me check the options:

G: (3x + 2)/(3(2x +1)) → Yes, that's the same as (3x+2)/(6x+3).

So the correct answer should be option G.

The problem involves computing the conditional expectation of Y given X for a joint density function f(x, y) = x + y for 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1. 

The steps were as follows:

1. **Find the marginal density of X**: Integrate f(x, y) over y to get f_X(x) = x + 1/2.
2. **Determine the conditional density**: f(y | x) = (x + y) / (x + 1/2).
3. **Compute the conditional expectation**: Integrate y * f(y | x) dy from 0 to 1, resulting in E[Y | X=x] = (3x + 2)/(6x + 3).
4. **Match with options**: Option G matches this result.
