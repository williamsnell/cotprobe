Okay, so I've got this insurance question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take my time because I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.

Alright, the question says: Mr. Singer insured his house for $36,000 with an 80% coinsurance clause. The house's value is $45,000, and he had a fire loss of $10,500. The question is, how much does the insurance company pay him?

Hmm, coinsurance is the policy that covers part of the loss if the insured party fails to mitigate the damage. The coinsurance clause here is 80%, which I think means that the insured party has to cover 80% of the loss. So, if the insured doesn't pay enough, the insurance company will pay the difference up to their policy limit.

Wait, but wait. I remember that coinsurance is usually a percentage of the actual damage. So, if the loss is $10,500, the insurance company would cover 80% of that. Let me calculate that: 80% of $10,500 is 0.8 * 10500. Let me do the math: 10,000 * 0.8 is 8,000, and 500 * 0.8 is 400, so total is 8400. So, the insurance would pay $8,400.

Wait, but wait a second. There's also something about the policy's limit. The policy is for $36,000, but the loss is $10,500. Since 80% of the loss is $8,400, which is less than the policy limit, the insurance company would pay the full amount of the coinsurance, right? Because the loss is covered entirely, not needing to go beyond the policy limit.

So the payment from the insurance company would be $8,400. Let me look at the options. Option C is $8,400, so that's probably the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not getting confused with coinsurance. The policy has a 80% coinsurance clause, meaning the insured has to pay 80% of the loss, but the insurance company's payment is usually the coinsurance amount, not the difference. So, in this case, since the loss is entirely covered, the insurance company will pay 80% of $10,500, which is $8,400.

So the answer should be option C: $8,400.

The correct answer is C: $8,400.
